Abstract
In recent weeks, several seroprevalence studies have appeared which attempt to
determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of
certain European and American locations. Many of these studies find an antibody
prevalence comparable to the false positive rate of their respective serology tests and
the relatively low statistical power associated with each study has invited criticism.
To determine the strength of the signal, we perform a meta-analysis on the publicly
available seroprevalence data based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling with Markov
Chain Monte Carlo and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling with prediction sampling.
We examine studies with results from Santa Clara County (CA), Los Angeles County
(CA), San Miguel County (CO), Chelsea (MA), the Comté de Genève (Switzerland),
and Gangelt (Germany). Our results are in broad agreement with the conclusions of
the studies; we find that there is evidence for non-trivial levels of antibody prevalence
across all study locations. However, we also find that a significant probability mass
exists for antibody prevalence at levels lower than the reported figures. The results
of our meta-analysis on the recent seroprevalence studies point to an important and
strongly suggestive signal.

Introduction

The latest weapon against COVID-19 is serology testing—a search for antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 in the population’s bloodstream. A high prevalence of antibodies in the
population helps us better understand the likelihood of asymptomatic infections or

infections with mild symptoms. Moreover, high antibody prevalence indicates that a
significant fraction of the population has already been exposed, lowering estimates of
the infection fatality rate, and providing possible clues about herd immunity. Given
the importance of determining the societal-wide exposure to SARS-CoV-2, critically
understanding the results from the seroprevalence studies represents a pressing concern.
The recent serology study [1] from Santa Clara County, in which the authors report
that the Santa Clara area has an antibody prevalence of 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI
1.11-1.97%), has received sharp criticism [2, 3]. In particular, the combination of
the small sample size, small effect size, and a competitive false positive rate led to
a study with relatively low statistical power. But, given the potential importance of
serology analysis to our understanding of COVID-19, we must extract all the available
information that the data contain. We simply cannot afford to dismiss weak signals.
Along with the Santa Clara study, a number of other studies have recently appeared
using different types of tests [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Results are disparate. For example, the
study in Chelsea, Massachusetts suggests an antibody prevalence as high as 30%, in
marked contrast to the low levels detected by the Santa Clara study. Given the early
days of this type of research, and the unevenness of the infection rates across regions, a
noisy picture does not surprise us.
In this note we perform a meta-analysis based on the data from seven different
studies. We apply two methods: 1) Bayesian hierarchical modelling with Markov Chain
Monte Carlo, 2) Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling (GLMM) with prediction sampling.
Both methods lead to similar results. We find that there is evidence for non-trivial
levels of antibodies in the populations across all the studies—in broad concordance
with the seroprevalence study conclusions—but that smaller than publicly stated levels
are also probable.

Data, methods, and results

The studies we analyze were conducted in the last few weeks; peer-reviewed scientific
publications are not yet available. We construct our datasets from scientific preprints,
manufacturers’ specifications, and transcripts from interviews with study authors
published in the news media.
Each study differs in its sampling strategy, and data on sample demographics is not
yet available for most studies. In each study, the authors aim to collect a representative
sample of their population. We did not attempt to post-stratify any of the results,
and our analysis is therefore limited by our lack of knowledge of the demographics
associated with the samples in each study.
2.1

Study locations

In this sub-section we summarize the data we found on each study. The studies are
highly varied with differing levels of publicly available information.

Gangelt, Germany. This ongoing study started on March 30, 2020, and is scheduled
to run through to the end of April. The study aims to determine the prevalence of

antibodies in the German town of Gangelt. On April 10, 2020 the authors published
preliminary results [4], stating that “around” 500 individuals had been investigated,
with 14% testing positive for IgG antibodies. We assume this figure means that 70
individuals tested positive. The preprint does not mention which serology test the
authors use, but the principal author is quoted in Die Zeit on April 10, 2020, stating that
the study uses the IgG ELISA test produced by EUROIMMUN AG [9]. The authors do
not include demographic information, but they do refer to the WHO recommendation
of investigating a random sample of 100-300 households. The authors state that they
investigated “approximately” 1000 individuals from “approximately” 400 households,
and that the preliminary results are for “approximately” 500 individuals.

Geneva, Switzerland. This ongoing study started in early April 2020 in the Comté
de Genève [10, 5]. The study releases results on a weekly basis. According to their
study protocol, researchers use the same EUROIMMUN ELISA test for IgG antibodies
as the Gangelt study. In the week of April 6 to 10, researchers found that 3.5% of the
343 participants tested positive, which we interpret as 12 individuals. In the week of
April 14 to 17, they found that 5.5% of the 417 participants tested positive, which we
interpret as 23 individuals.

Chelsea, Massachussetts This small study is mentioned in a news piece published
by Science on April 21, 2020 [2]. From the article: Massachusetts General Hospital
pathologists John Iafrate and Vivek Naranbhai quickly organized a local serology survey.
Within 2 days, they collected blood samples from 200 passersby on a street corner.
Of those 200, 63 individuals tested positive. The researchers use a serological test
manufactured by BioMedomics [11].

San Miguel County, Colorado This study aims to test most residents from a
county in Colorado, with a population of approximately 8,000. The study is conducted
in partnership with the serological test manufacturer UBI Group. In a progress update
published on April 21, the county announced that out of 4,757 antibody tests processed,
26 were positive, and 70 were “borderline”. The county’s web-page notes that A
borderline result on the first test indicates that the result produced a “high-signal flash”
which is not enough to produce a positive result. A borderline result means that the
individual may have been recently exposed to COVID-19 and may be in the early stage of
producing antibodies. In our analysis, we include the borderline cases (96 total positive
tests, out of 4,757).

Santa Clara County, California This study was conducted over the short period
April 3, 2020 to April 4, 2020 [1]. Out of 3,330 individuals sampled, 50 tested positive
suggesting a prevalence of 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.11-1.97%). The authors sampled
the population through targeted Facebook invitations. The resulting sample contains
bias in age and socio-economic status. The authors adjusted their results by poststratifying to match the Santa-Clara County demographics. They report an adjusted
estimate for antibody prevalence of 2.81% (95CI 2.24-3.37%). This study features a

Ltd., and distributed in the United States by Premier Biotech, Inc.

Los Angeles County, California This study was conducted between April 10, and
April 11, 2020 [7, 12], involving some of the same authors from the Santa Clara study.
A preprint of this study is not yet available, but the raw numbers were announced in
communiques made by LA County Public Health, and University of Southern California.
Out of 863 participants, 4.1% tested positive, which we interpret as 35 individuals. The
researchers reported the 95% confidence bounds on the prevalence of 2.8%, and 5.6%.
The sample was generated by a random draw from a marketing firm’s database, made
to be representative of the County’s demographics. They used the antibody test sold
by Premier Biotech, the same used for the Santa Clara study.

Table 1: Data from the serology studies

Studies not included There are several other COVID-19 seroprevalence studies that
we do not included due to a lack of data about the case counts and the serology test
specifications. Given the size of these studies and the potential impact of their stated
results, we feel that releasing the underlying data is of paramount importance.
• New York. On April 24, 2020 the State of New York announced the results of a
COVID-19 antibody study conducted over the preceding week. In the sample of
3,000 individuals, the state reported that 13% tested positive. Within those, the
subset of New York City residents (1,300 individuals) tested positive at 21%. We
could not find any specifications about the antibody test used.
• Netherlands. The Netherlands’ central blood bank (Sanquin) tracks COVID19 antibodies by sampling the blood donations they collect on a weekly basis.
However, the test they use is unknown to us (one of the study leads is quoted in a
Science news piece [2]: Hans Zaaijer, a virologist at Sanquin, the Dutch national
blood bank, who helped lead the study, says the team used a commercial test, which
“consistently shows superior results” in validation studies, but didn’t provide more
details. . In their first set of results [8], the Dutch announced that out of 4208

samples, 135 tested positive. Of these, there were 688 (25 pos.) in the 18–30 age
range, 494 (17 pos.) in the 31–40 range, 752 (26 pos.) in the 41–50 range, 1234
(38 pos.) in the 51-60 range, 1030 (29 pos.) in the 61-70 range, and 10 (0 pos.) in
the 71–80 range.
• Denmark. Denmark is conducting a study similar to the Netherlands in which
they are sampling weekly donations at their central blood bank. In an update
published on April 7, 2020, the Danish Health Authority [13] indicates that
among 1,000 blood donors, 2.7% had tested positive for antibodies. They also
reported that the sensitivity of their test is 70% (there was no information on test
specificity). This sensitivity figure is the same reported by Danish researchers for
the EUROIMMUN IgG test [14]. However we could not confirm this association.
2.2

Test specifications

The seven studies we consider use four different test types. Each test has a different
false positive rate and a different false negative rate. We include data on each test to
build our models.

EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test This test is used in the Gangelt [4], and Geneva
studies [10, 5]. Its performance was assessed independently by a team of Danish
researchers (Lassaunière et al., [14]). In their assessment, 20 out of 30 confirmed positive
samples tested positive, and 3 out of 82 confirmed negative samples tested positive. The
authors note that “borderline data were considered negative”. These results mitigate
the manufacturer’s claim that their test has >99% specificity. One reason for the lower
specificity seems to be the test’s cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, as found by
Okba et al. [15].

BioMedomics COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test The manufacturer’s own assessment [11] found that out of 397 confirmed positive samples, 352 tested positive, and
out of 128 confirmed negative samples, 12 tested positive.

UBI SARS-CoV-2 ELISA The manufacturer claims that 100% of the blood samples
collected at day 10 or later after infection from SARS-CoV-2 from patients who tested
positive to COVID-19 by other methods were also found to be positive using the UBI R
SARS-CoV-2 ELISA [16]. In the absence of an actual figure for the number of tests,
we assumed a conservative N = 30. In addition, UBI indicates that out of “over 900”
blood samples collected before the COVID-19 outbreak, none tested positive. Again,
we took a conservative approach, and assumed N = 900.

Premier Biotech COVID-19 IgG and IgM rapid test This COVID-19 antibody
test is manufactured in China by Hangzhou Biotest Biotech Co., Ltd., and distributed
in the United States by Premier Biotech, Inc. It is based on a combination of IgG, and
IgM antibody detection. Both the manufacturer and the researchers leading the Santa
Clara County study, assessed the test performance. The manufacturer found that 75

out of 75 clinically confirmed COVID-19 patients with positive IgG tested positive, and
78 out of 85 confirmed IgM-positive samples tested positive. The manufacturer also
found that 369 out of 371 confirmed negative samples tested negative. The Santa Clara
study authors found that in a set of 37 samples confirmed to be PCR-positive, and IgGor IgM-positive, 25 tested positive. They also found that out of 30 confirmed negative
samples, 30 tested negative.

Statistical analysis and results

Our first approach uses a hierarchical Bayesian model, which we solved by Markov
Chain Monte Carlo using Stan [17]. There are three observables in the model:
• nobs (i), the number of positive antibody tests out of Nobs (i) individuals tested in
each location i;
• nfpos (j), the number of positive antibody tests out of Nneg (j) confirmed negative
samples in the validation for each test brand j (false positives);
• nfneg (j), the number of negative antibody tests out of Npos (j) confirmed positive
samples in the validation for each test brand j (false negatives).
From these observables, we infer, pprev (i), the prevalence of antibodies at each location,
i. The number of positive antibody tests nobs (i) observed in each study are random
variables that depend on pprev (i), but also on pfpos (j(i)) and pfneg (j(i)), which are the

false positive and false negative rates of each serology test type j, indexed as a function
of study i, namely
nobs (i) ∼ Binomial(Nobs (i), pobs (i)),
pobs (i) = pprev (i)(1 − pfneg (j(i))) + (1 − pprev (i))pfpos (j(i)),
nfpos (j) ∼ Binomial(Nneg (j), pfpos (j))
nfneg (j) ∼ Binomial(Npos (j), pfneg (j)).

(1)

Our prior construction reads,
pprev (i) = logit−1 (αprev )
pfpos (j) = logit−1 (αfpos )
pfneg (j) = logit−1 (αfneg )
αprev (i) ∼ Normal(µprev , σprev )
αfpos (j) ∼ Normal(µfpos , σfpos )
αfneg (j) ∼ Normal(µfneg , σfneg ),

(2)

with hyper-priors of,
µprev, fpos, fneg ∼ Normal(0, 10)
σprev, fpos, fneg ∼ Exponential(1).

(3)

We run the model in Stan using 4 chains each with 10,000 samples, discarding the first
5,000 as part of the MCMC warm-up. The 20,000 post warm-up samples result in R̂
values above 0.9999 for all parameters in the model, and effective sample counts of
approximately 10,000.
We plot the marginal posterior density functions for the antibody prevalence at each
location in figure 1. The Santa Clara study shows a density function consistent with a
high probability of a non-zero antibody prevalence, with a mean and a mode slightly
greater than 1%, although we note that the posterior distribution does include zero.
Los Angeles stands out—the mode of the distribution sits at 4% with a 95% credible
interval that does not include zero. The German town of Gangelt was particularly hard
hit by COVID-19 and the subsequent serology study suggests an antibody prevalence
of 14%. Our Bayesian analysis is consistent with the study’s result, but we see that the
posterior distribution has a tail that includes a prevalence below 10%.
The contours in figure 2 show a two dimensional slice through the posterior distribution revealing the probability density in the prevalence-false positive plane. While
the Santa Clara study has a false positive rate competitive with the implied prevalence,
our Bayesian result clearly shows the mode located substantially greater than zero
prevalence.
Figures 1 and 2 show that Geneva has an implied prevalence close to zero. The
EUROIMMUN test used in the Geneva studies has a relatively high false positive
rate, creating tension in the resulting marginal posterior distributions. A significant
probability mass sits at zero for both weeks of the Geneva study.

Prevalence of antibodies

Figure 1: Marginal posterior distribution functions for antibody prevalence at each study
location from Bayesian hierarchical model.
Both figures for San Miguel County (CO) show a strong antibody prevalence result.
The strength comes from the low false positive rate associated with the study’s serology
test (UBI). However, data on the UBI test is not fully available, and the strength of
the result in part relies on our educated guess on the test’s sensitivity, as outlined in
2.2. The Bayesian analysis pulls the low false positive rate away from zero.
The Chelsea (MA) study uses a serology test (BioMedomics) with a relatively high
false positive rate. However, the strength of the signal coupled to the Bayesian learning
across all the studies strongly suggest a highly non-zero antibody prevalence level. The
95% credible interval around the mode excludes a prevalence level below 10%.
As a check on the the Bayesian implementation, we use a set of binomial Generalized
Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with prediction sampling. Mixed models provide

estimations in situations which have have sub-population specific effects by borrowing
strength from population averages (see, for example, [18]). The borrowing effect or
“shrinkage” tempers those sub-populations which have relatively less data but otherwise
allows the data to speak for itself. GLMM provides an optimal compromise between
complete pooling and no pooling of the sub-populations in a regression analysis. In that
sense GLMM is a precursor to Bayesian approaches which permit greater flexibility
through priors and hyper-priors and afford more control over shrinkage effects.
Using [19, 20], we build separate GLMMs for the empirical count observation process
across the study locations, for the test type false positive rates, and for the test type false
negative rates. In total, we have three GLMMs. We then build Monte Carlo prediction
samples [21] for the means of each GLMM and compute the implied prevalence. The

where i denotes the GLMM model for the k-th sample.
Figure 7 shows the resulting density functions for the antibody prevalence in each
location from the GLMM prediction sampling. Notice the similarity with figure 1; both
of our implementations lead to similar density functions and are in broad agreement.
The Santa Clara study suggests a prevalence of 1.5% and we see in the figure that the
quoted value is just beyond the mode of the distribution. We also notice that Santa
Clara has a heavy tail towards zero, just as we found in the Bayesian analysis. Yet,
in part by relying on “borrowing strength” from the across all the studies, we also see
that the Santa Clara result clearly suggests a non-zero antibody prevalence. Again, we
also see a strong effect in Los Angeles County, with a mode of 4%; the 95% confidence
interval around the mean does not include zero. In figure 8 we show the 95% confidence
intervals with the mean for all locations computed from the GLMM sampling.
In figure 9 we show a contour density map of the prevalence with the false positive
rate. We can clearly see the tension between the false positive rate and prevalence
but we also see a clear signal associated with each region. Again, notice the similarity
to figure 2. In particular, note that San Miguel County (CO) again shows a strong
prevalence result, but that the GLMM shrinks the false positive rate away from zero.
The GLMM is in some sense “semi-Bayesian”—we have a hierarchical model with a
random effect on the intercept term in logit space which we sample over, but we do
not have a formal set of priors with hyper-parameters. While the GLMM provides a
basis for learning across the data, our full Bayesian specification with Markov Chain
Monte Carlo provides a more complete result. However, by implementing the GLMM
we see that our results are robust to different approaches and model specifications. Our
results are not sensitive to the specifics of the prior and hyper-prior constructions in
our Bayesian model.
Both methods demonstrate that there is significant evidence for non-trivial antibody
prevalence in the populations associated with these studies. While the individual
statistical power of each study is not high, using Bayesian techniques and GLMM
constructions on the data from all the studies reveal a definite signal that we should
take seriously.

Discussion

Seroprevalence studies are an important tool in combating COVID-19 since public
policies are dependent on how far the disease has already penetrated into the general
population. Not only does serology testing help us understand the overall infection
fatality rate of the disease, but testing also helps us design targeted strategies such as
contact tracing. Furthermore, serology studies can provide insight into the dynamics of
the disease propagation.
While we do not correct for possible population sample bias or other demographic
issues, our analysis points to an important signal: the seroprevalence studies to date
show that a significant fraction of the populations examined have antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 in their bloodstream. The exact prevalence levels are highly region
dependent. As more serology studies appear, they will sharpen our understanding of
antibody prevalence in the general population.
The quality of antibody prevalence estimates depend on sample size and on the
specificity/sensitivity of the antibody test. High test specificity increases statistical
power. Thus, there is a natural trade-off between investing in tests of high quality, the
human resources required to generate large sample sizes, and the speed at which society
needs results. The societal and economic consequences between Type I and Type II
errors are not equal.
