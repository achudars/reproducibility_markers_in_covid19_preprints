To unravel the source of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and the pattern of its spreading
and evolution in the United Arab Emirates, we conducted meta-transcriptome
sequencing of 1,067 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between May 9th and Jun
29th, 2020 during the first peak of the local COVID-19 epidemic. We identified global
clade distribution and eleven novel genetic variants that were almost absent in the rest of
the world defined five subclades specific to the UAE viral population. Cross-settlement
human-to-human transmission was related to the local business activity. Perhaps
surprisingly, at least 5% of the population were co-infected by SARS-CoV-2 of multiple
clades within the same host. We also discovered an enrichment of cytosine-to-uracil
mutation among the viral population collected from the nasopharynx, that is different
from the adenosine-to-inosine change previously reported in the bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid samples and a previously unidentified upregulation of APOBEC4 expression in
nasopharynx among infected patients, indicating the innate immune host response
mediated by ADAR and APOBEC gene families could be tissue-specific. The genomic
epidemiological and molecular biological knowledge reported here provides new insights
for the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and points out future direction on
host-pathogen interaction investigation.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the infection of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1), has become the largest outbreak
since the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic(2). It has resulted in 131.83 million cases
and 2.86 million death, as of March, 2021(3). Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can
experience a number of serious respiratory illnesses and have in many cases died from
complications related to the infection(4). There are no specific therapeutics or fully
validated vaccines available for its control to date(5, 6). Dynamic transmission modelling
considering seasonal variation, immunity and intervention suggests a high possibility of
continuing waves of resurgence until the year 2025(7).

Genomic epidemiology using massively parallel high-throughput sequencing
technologies (MPS) and associated analyses and bioinformatics tools have been used to
understand the rapid spread and evolution of the virus at a larger scale than ever
before(8, 9). Public repositories including GISAID have enabled fast release and sharing
of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences(10). Those efforts provide valuable information to
researchers and public health officials for global outbreak responses. Nevertheless,
there are new questions arising regarding the virus’ ongoing breadth of transmission, its
evolution inter- and intra-host, as well as host-pathogen interactions. The genetic
diversity of global viral strains is largely underestimated given the lack of real-time
sequencing capability in most of the world, resulting in a disproportional under-study of
viral populations in under- and recently-developed countries. As a consequence, there is
limited information on novel and common genetic variation in those areas where virus
rapidly evolves and is subjected to natural selection, as it encounters human hosts with
diverse genetic background and an environment with varying temperature and humidity
levels(11, 12). Most published research since the start of the pandemic has focused on
inter-host phylogenetics based on the assumption that only one strain of the virus is
present in the sample. Intra-host viral genetic diversity and the prevalence of coinfection
has not been established via sufficiently large cohort despite the possibility that it might
impact clinical outcomes and potentially enable higher resolution analysis in the
who-infects-whom transmission chain(13). Finally, while understanding how the host
response to the virus will help to combat the disease, innate immune response process
such as the host-dependent RNA-editing mechanism has only been investigated among
limited sample cases(14).

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the world’s most famous international
hubs for business and travel and is the first country to approve a Chinese COVID-19
vaccine. Despite a long-lasting period of epidemic, only a few of the SARS-CoV-2
samples were sequenced and the transmission and evolution patterns of the virus in this
area is unknown. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the country on January
29th, 2020 (Figure 1). The subsequent outbreaks infected over sixty thousand individuals
by the end of June 2020 and three hundred thousand individuals by the end of
December 2020(3). Since March 2020, the UAE public health authorities have adopted a

series of strict regulations to reduce human-to-human transmission, including airport
lockdown and national curfew. On the other hand, due to economic pressures, a few
international flights reopened gradually in June 2020, which may be one of the reasons
for the subsequent small second peak during June and August. The most outstanding
third epidemic peak were observed during the December Christmas time in 2020. There
have been 2-4 thousand newly confirmed cases in the country since Christmas. Since
the very beginning, as a response to the pandemic, several high-throughput molecular
technologies have been adopted in the UAE to extensively monitor the viral spread and
for rapid screening of infected patients. A nationwide RT-qPCR screening program
conducting ten thousand tests daily was launched on March 31st 2020. Almost
simultaneously, a high-throughput sequencing laboratory with 12-18Tbases/day capacity
was established in early April 2020, enabling meta-transcriptome sequencing of up to
192 samples in 24 hours.

To understand the transmission and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within the
UAE and in relation to other countries, during April and July, 2020, we randomly
collected 1,067 nasopharyngeal specimens from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from the
RT-qPCR screening program and conducted meta-transcriptomic sequencing. Our main
scientific questions include (1) What is the virus genetic diversity and transmission
pattern in the UAE during the first peak of the epidemic (2) What is the extent of
co-infection of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in this international travel hub (3) Is there
any innate immune host response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be detected
using the meta-transcriptomic sequencing, which contains both the host and the viral
gene expression information.

A total of 1,067 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive
patients between May 7th and June 29th 2020 in Abu Dhabi were sequenced (Figure 1A).
Their sequencing quality metrics were summarized in Figure S1 and Table S1. We
obtained high quality assemblies (gap proportion < 2%) for the majority of the samples
(n= 896, 84.0%). In brief, using the 29891nt SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
(IVDC-HB-01), we have successfully assembled all 1,067 SARS-CoV-2 consensus
genomes as follows- 896 assemblies with gaps less than 500nt (gap proportion < 2%),
27 assemblies with gap less than 1000nt (gap proportion < 4%), 14 assemblies with
gaps less than 1500nt (gap proportion ~5%) and 130 assemblies with gaps greater than
1500nt (Figure 1B). As expected, quality of the genome assemblies was closely related
to the sample viral load as measured by reads per million (RPM) and qRT-PCR Ct
values (Figure 1B, Figure S2). A set of 3 samples (id:0555, 0919 and 0945) showed low
viral loads (Ct<19) with unexpectedly poor assemblies (gaps>1500nt), likely due to RNA

The distribution of gaps identified in the sequences indicates low sequencing
coverage over the 5’ and the 3’ ends of the genomes, which was found to be a common
occurrence in all world-wide assemblies reported in GISAID. We also notice a
significantly higher number of gaps around the 20,000nt position for 27.1% of the
assemblies submitted to GISAID, which were not observed in our assemblies (Figure
S3). Among the selected 896 assemblies with the highest quality (gap proportion < 2%),
we identified a total of 1,245 genetic variants consisting of 698 non-synonymous and 547
synonymous variants when compared to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
(IVDC-HB-01), (Figure 1C, Table S2). The number of variants per sample ranged from 1
to 24 with a median number of 11 (Figure S4). Very few genomes carried non-single
nucleotide variants. There was one 2nt insertion in one sample 1069 and six deletions
identified in fourteen samples 0188,0236,0252, 0290, 0305, 0339, 0512, 0536, 0757,
0758, 0761, 0763, 0785 and 1092, the largest being a 4nt deletion present in seven of
the fourteen samples (Figure S5). The consensus variants identified from the technical
replicates were exactly the same (Table S3), and given a 4% alternative allele frequency
threshold, the concordance rate of intra-host genetic variant detection reaches 100%
(Figure S6). The number of variants that we identified per sample did not correlate with
the sequencing depth (squared pearson correlation coefficient R2~0.02) (Figure S7).

Likely due to fast population expansion with a short period, we discovered that 395
out of the 896 genomes (44.1%) assembled in our study shared an identical genome
sequence with at least one other assembled genome (Table S4). For the purpose of
downstream phylogenetic analysis, we filtered the 896 genome sequences as to keep
only unique sequences, resulting in 637 unique genome sequences. We constructed a
maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree including, 1) the 637 SARS-CoV-2 unique
genomes and collected assembled in our study between May 7th and June 29th 2020 in
Abu Dhabi, 2) the 52 nearest relative world-wide genomes identified from GISAID
between February 2nd and April 24th 2020 (Table S6, Figure S8), and 3) 25 genomes
collected from the nearby Dubai Emirate between January 29th and March 18th 2020
(15) . We identified the five dominant clades worldwide (16, 17) in the UAE viral
population sequenced in this study (Figure 2A). A total of 13 (2.04%) and 140 viral
genomes (21.98%) out of the 637 genomes were clustered as clade 19A and clade 19B,
respectively, the two earliest clades first reported in China, Asia(18), while the rest of the
genomes sequences were classified in the clades 20A (N=52, 8.16%), 20B (N=428,
67.19%) and 20C (N=4, 0.63%), which were first reported and became prevalent in
Europe and North America4,16. Three samples in clade 19A, i.e. samples 0134, 0135 and
0565, harbored a higher number of mutations; 20, 19 and 19, respectively, compared to

the calculated average of 11 variants per genome. The closest strain found to these
three samples was SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA-S771/2020 reported in Washington, DC,
United States on April 13th, 2020 (Table S6). The high level of mutations occurring in
these samples compared to the rest of the UAE genomes, indicates a different
introduction of strains within the same clade.

There were five large sub-clades involving more than half of the collected samples
(381 out of the 637 unique viral genomes, 59.81%) (Figure 2A), differentiated by eleven
mutations that were common in the UAE viral population (allele frequency > 5%) and that
were significantly less common among the worldwide viral population (P < 3.94e-82,
Fisher exact test) (Figure 2B, Table 1). The five sub-clades were (1) 19B.1 which
consisted of 17.27% of the 637 UAE unique samples, harboring the G28878A, G29742A,
G11230T and G28167A mutations; (2) 20B.1 which consisted of 8.48% of the samples,
harboring the T7171C and C27002T mutations; (3) 20B.2 which consisted of 19.15% of
the samples, harboring the T21775G and G5924A mutations; (4) 20B.3 which consisted
of 8.95% of the samples, harboring the G23311T mutation and (5) 20B.4 which
consisted of 5.97% of the samples, harboring the C7851T and the A24170G mutations.

Fortunately, individuals classified as carrying certain subclades of the virus did not
display significantly different viral loads in their samples as reflected by the RT-qPCR Ct
values (Figure 3). These 11 variants that defined the subclades tend to occur in highly
conserved regions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure S9). Molecular dynamic
analysis of two of the missense variants in the spike protein did not suggest substantially
different change of the protein structure between the mutant and the wildtype (Figure
S10, Table S7). Likely due to a recent occurrence, the temporal change of the mutation
allele frequency for the subclade-definitive variants is smaller compared to the
clade-definitive variants (Figure S11-S12).

We further investigated human-to-human transmission across 14 settlements from
three regions in the Abu Dhabi Emirate and 1 settlement in the Dubai Emirate by
constructing the transmission network for 120 samples with geographical and sampling
date information (Figure 4A). The constructed transmission network indicates prevalent
cross-settlement human-to-human transmissions contributing to the epidemic, as within
each clade or sub-clade, samples from multiple geographical areas were observed
(Figure 4B). We also determined the genetic distance using the L1-norm metric that
utilized intra-host genetic variation rather than merely the consensus genetic variation,
among longitudinal samples (n=24) defined as, same individuals (n=7) sampled multiple
times (avg=5.2) over a determined period of time (avg= 4.06 days), and among samples
from the same and varying settlements (Figure 4C). The median L1-norm genetic
distance was smallest among the 24 samples within the longitudinal sampling period,
suggesting high levels of stability in viral composition within the same host. As expected,

most samples within the same settlement had a genetic distance smaller than the
cross-area distance with only two exceptions - samples from the Ghayathi settlement in
the AI-Dhafra region and samples from Khabisi in the Dubai emirate, that displayed the
largest genetic distance. This is consistent with the fact that those two settlements were
relatively less populous compared to the settlements in the Abu Dhabi and AI-Ain
regions. The spectrum and the scale of the L1-norm genetic distance is much larger than
the genetic computed from the consensus genetic variants although the haplotype
information is missing. Due to the small scale of sampling, we didn’t further resolve the
transmission network to a finer scale.

The international hub status of the UAE provides a good opportunity to study the
prevalence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant co-infection within the same host. We have
identified a total of 1,268 intra-host single nucleotide variation (iSNV, with minor allele
count of 4 and minor allele frequency greater than 5%) present in 625 out of the 896
samples, ranging from 1 to 26 iSNV per individual with an average of one per individual
(Figure S13). Although the technical replicates indicate 100% concordance of the iSNV
detection at the above threshold, we chose a conservative way of evaluating the
prevalence of multiple infection present in the sampled viral population by restricting the
definition of co-infection by the co-occurrence of two clades including 19A, 19B, 20A,
20B and 20C (classified using the eleven clade-definitive variants in Figure 2) or
subclades (classified using the other eleven sub-clade definitive variants) in the same
sample. We found that a total of 48 samples out of the 896 (5%) carried viral variants
from more than two distinct clades or subclades (Figure 5). The high linkage
disequilibrium of the genetic variants that belong to a specific clade indicates the likely
presence of a viral variant rather than spontaneous de novo mutations. Notably, two of
the samples (id: 0855 and 0796) with identical consensus sequence displayed different
patterns of multiple infection. Sample 0796 harbored viral genetic variants from clades
19A, 20A, 20B while 0855 harbored variants from clades 20A, and 20B and not from 19A.
Samples in the same clade classified by the consensus variants also demonstrate a
different pattern of co-infection. For example, for samples in clade 19B, two clusters
were observed. One consists of seven samples with multiple infections from several
clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B) and the other cluster consists of ten samples co-infected
with 19B and 20A. For the most prevalent clade 20B viral sub-population, samples could
be co-infected by 19A or 20C. Those patterns in Figure 5A largely maintain when using a
0.5% minor allele frequency threshold and the same 4 minor allele support (Figure
S14-S15), showing a tremendous amount of intra-host genetic diversity underlying the
consensus genomes of the host.

We further investigated detectable innate immune host response to SARS-CoV-2
infection utilizing information that can be extracted from the meta-transcriptomic
sequencing. A recent publication by Giorgio et al. reported evidence of RNA editing in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from eight patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2
infection in Wuhan city, China(19). For seven out of the eight samples, they identified a
bias of the mutation towards transition, mainly A>G/T>C changes followed by C>T/G>A
changes, indicating a deamination effect introduced by ADARs and APOBECs,
respectively (WH BALF in Figure 6A). In the nasopharyngeal swab sampling of 896
patients in our study, on the contrary, we identified the C>T/G>A as the predominant
SNV type that were more likely to be mediated by APOBEC gene family rather than the
A>G/T>C effects mediated by the ADARs (UAE in Figure 6A). This held true when only
mutations that occurred in more than two patients were considered. As expected, the
C-to-U changes are biased toward the positive strand, i.e. more C-to-U was observed
compared to G-to-A, as APOBECs are supposed to target single stranded RNA(20). The
observation of a dominant C-to-U changes were replicated in the nasopharyngeal swab
samples collected in Spain, Virginia and Ruijin hospitals in Shanghai city, China and the
23,164 high quality sequences collected in GISAID (Supplementary notes), which
consistently displayed an enrichment in the C>T/G>A mutations, same as the pattern in
the UAE nasal swab samples but different from the Chinese BALF results reported by

cytosine depletion in viral sequences during the past ten months, reflected by an
increasing of T and A bases and a decreasing of G and C bases (Figure S16).

We further investigated if the different patterns observed could be due to the
differential gene expression of the APOBEC gene families and ADAR in the
nasopharyngeal swab vs. BALF using public multi-tissue gene expression information
from GTEx repository(21) and by analyzing the gene expression of APOBEC and ADAR
genes in our sequencing data. According to the GTEx gene expression data among 49
tissues and cells, ADAR demonstrated the highest gene expression compared
to APOBEC gene family in the lung and in the minor salivary gland, the two most
relevant tissue compared to the nasopharynx used in our study (Figure S17). The GTEx
information cannot directly explain the different mutation pattern between the BALF and
the nasal swab samples.

Distinct from the GTEx profile obtained from the uninfected individuals (Figure S17),
APOBEC4（A4） displayed the highest average gene expression in the nasal swab

samples collected in our study, followed by ADAR and APOBEC3A, while there were
very few samples expressed APOBEC1, APOBEC2 and APOBEC3H (Figure 6B) . The
difference of gene expression is significant between A4 and the ADAR (Wilcoxon test
P=7.7e-05) and the largest difference was observed among the individuals carrying
clade 20A variants followed by the clade 19B variants (Figure 6B, Table S8). In GTEx,

A4 is expressed most prominently in testis, lowly expressed in lung and infrequently
expressed in other tissues (Figure S17).

The significantly up-regulated A4 gene expression in the nasopharynx could have
been triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A4 was an under-studied putative
cytidine-to-uridine editing enzyme, which cytidine deaminase activity was not as
well-known as the APOBEC3A(22). The sequencing data not aligned to the
SARS-CoV-2 were filtered out from the BALF samples and therefore, we were not able
to investigate the gene expression of those host genes in this tissue. That the A4 was
previously reported to enhance the replication of HIV-1 indicates its involvement against
the RNA virus infection. The high expression of A4 in nasopharynx may provide the first
evidence that the enzyme may be involved as part of the host responses upon the
SARS-CoV-2 infection and further experimental analysis is worthwhile to understand its
exact functions.

Our analysis of the 1,067 viral genomes collected in the UAE suggest that, during the
first quarter of 2020, there were multiple and likely independent introductions of
SARS-COV-2. The five dominant global clades of SARS-CoV-2 were all commonly
present in the sampled individuals (Figure 2). The highest prevalence of the European
dominant clade 20B, followed by the East Asian dominant clade 19B, indicates effects of
either a larger founder population size or positive selection. There was substantial local
transmission within and between areas in the Abu Dhabi emirate (Figure 4). We have
identified 5 new sub-clades, namely; 19B.1, 20B.1, 20B.2, 20B.3 and 20B.4, defined by
11 variants uniquely found within the UAE. Those variants are potentially neutral given
that no significantly different viral loads (reflected by the RT-qPCR test) were detected
between patients carrying the subclades and those did not (Figure 3).

While consensus sequences tend to be highly similar, intra-host variation adds
information which is a promising novel direction for resolving finer-scale transmission
networks and studying co-infection of the patients. This study offers the first insight into
the prevalence of co-infections of multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains in a large cohort. We
observed that at least 5% of the patients were infected by more than one SARS-CoV-2
strain. Within-host co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants has been reported in very few
studies and with limited sample size. The environment created by the UAE’s
“international hub” status also enables a reliable approach to study co-infection within an
individual by different strains of SARS-CoV-2 using clade and sub-clade definitive
genetic variants. This raises the importance of carefully collecting valuable
epidemiological data worldwide, on the origin and clinical relevance of the multiple
infections, and the possibility of further granularity when studying transmission dynamics
by utilizing information from multiple strains.

While this study showed that SARS-CoV-2 successfully mutated in the two-month
period collection in the United Arab Emirates, it is clear that a large number of mutational
changes have taken place in the past 10 months of this pandemic. This would likely
result in an immunologic battle between host response and changes in the viral genome
potentially leading to important structural changes. We observed a significant
accumulation of C-to-U mutations in the nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in this
study compared to the early stages of sampling around the globe. This pattern is
different to what has been reported in a recent study where an enrichment of A-to-G was
followed by T-to-C mutations in seven out of eight BALF samples from Wuhan(19). We
suspect that tissue-specific gene expression of ADAR and member of the APOBEC
protein family may contribute to this observation and discovered that APOBEC4 was
highly expressed in the nasopharynx. Given that APOBEC4 was previously reported to
enhance RNA virus replication and was mainly expressed in Testis in an ordinary status,
it will be interesting and worthwhile to understand more about its exact function towards
the SARS-CoV-2 infection using experimental analysis.

The genomic epidemiological insights from our study will provide a strong basis for
the surveillance of emerging mutations within the local viral population. Following the
gradual reopening of borders and worldwide travels, the continuous sequencing and
identification of allele frequency changes of those variants and additional experimental
validation are necessary to verify their biological impacts. Future efforts will be aimed at
speeding up the process in providing near real-time molecular surveillance and in the
coordination of epidemiological and genomic data to rapidly adapt to SARS-CoV-2
evolution to ensure public safety, adequate diagnosis and accurate pharmaceutical
development.

Patients with positive RT-qPCR SARS-COV-2 diagnosis are referred to local
designated hospitals administered by the Abu Dhabi Health Services Co (SEHA) and the
Department of Health in Abu Dhabi (DOH) for quarantine and treatment. Through a
routine surveillance system, all cases of SARS-CoV-2 are reported to the DOH.

In this population-based retrospective study, we have randomly selected 1,067
patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the months of May and June 2020,
regardless of their clinical symptoms. We collected the nasopharyngeal swab samples of
the patients from the population screening program and sent them to G42 Biogenix
laboratory for RNA extraction using the MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA
Extraction Kit (MGI, Shenzhen, China) on MGISP-960 (MGI, Shenzhen, China).
Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify viral abundance in the
sample, determined by Ct values. The electronic epidemiological meta-data was
provided by the DOH using the case report form. The study was approved by the Abu

Classification, de novo assembly and consensus variation detection of the

were processed using Kraken v0.10.5 (default parameters) with a self-built database of
Coronaviridae genomes (including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
downloaded from GISAID, NCBI, and CNGB) to identify Coronaviridae-like reads in a
sensitive manner. Fastp v0.19.5 (parameters: -q 20 -u 20 -n 1 -l 50) and SOAPnuke
v1.5.6 (parameters: -l 20 -q 0.2 -E 50 -n 0.02 -5 0 -Q 2 -G -d) were used to remove
low-quality reads, duplications, and adaptor contaminations. Low-complexity reads were
then removed using PRINSEQ v0.20.4 (parameters: -lc_method dust -lc_threshold 7).

Reads aligned to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
(BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019|EPI_ISL_402119) were classified as
SARS-CoV-2 reads. Sequencing depth was measured using samtools depth using the
default parameters. Samples that exhibited 10-fold average sequencing depth after
filtration were accepted for downstream analyses. Reads per million (RPM) belonging to
the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated by dividing the reads aligned to SARS-CoV-2 by the
total number of reads generated from the same sample.

The BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019|EPI_ISL_402119 sequence was used as
the virus reference genome. The IVDC-HB-01 reference lacks 12 A nucleotides at the
end compared to Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 and consists of 24 more sequences at the 5’
beginning compared to Wuhan/WH01/2019. SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences were
generated using Pilon v1.23 (parameters: --changes –vcf --changes --vcf --mindepth 10
--fix all, amb)16. Nucleotide positions with sequencing depth < 10× were masked as
ambiguous base N. We have also applied de novo assembly of the Coronaviridae-like
reads from samples with < 100× average sequencing depth using SPAdes (v3.14.0) with
the default settings. The Coronaviridae-like reads of samples with > 100× average
sequencing depth across SARS-CoV-2 genome were subsampled to achieve 100×
sequencing depth before being assembled. However, the assembled genomes are
enriched of errors and therefore we didn’t use those assembled sequences in the
downstream analysis.

Consensus variation detection and annotation

Pilon generates a variant calling formatted file for recording the consensus variation.
To verify the correctness of those consensus variation calls, we also applied freebayes

from the bam file. The low-confidence variants were removed with snippy-vcf_filter (v3.2)
(parameters: --minqual 100 --mincov 10 --minfrac 0.8). The correctness of those results
was evaluated using the two technical replicates (Table S3). The remaining variants in
VCF files generated by freebayes were annotated in SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies
and consensus sequences with SNVeff (v4.3) using default parameters17. Jalview
(v1.8.3) was used to perform multiple sequence alignment and estimate the
conservativeness score of the mutations18.
Intra-host variation detection

433

We applied reditools19 to compute the sequencing depth of the four A, C, G, T bases
(parameters: python2.7 reditools.py -f sample.bam -o sample.count.txt -S -s 0 -os 4 -r
ref.fa -q 25 -bq 35 -mbp 15 -Mbp 15). The intra-host genetic variation was detected using
reditools(24) with a minimum frequency of 5% and 4 copies of minor alleles. We have
applied three technical replicates for two samples to evaluate the accuracy of the
assembled sequence, the consensus and intra-host genetic variants. This conservative
cutoff was decided based on the two sets of technical replicates with examination of
concordance (SNV found in both samples) and discordance (SNV found in only one of
the two samples) for different frequency thresholds.
L1-norm genetic distance

We calculate the L1 norm genetic distance by comparing each variant nucleotide

We define dk as the distance measured at position k for comparing samples p and q,
and n is the total number of possible nucleotide configurations (A, C, G, T) to calculate
the difference in frequency of the same nucleotide in different two samples. For each pair
of samples, we use D to represent the sum of the degree of difference in all positions,
and N is the sum of the number of variant nucleotides in the two samples.

This single number D quantifies the degree of difference in all nucleotide variants

From the total 896 assembled high-quality genomes (<2% gap proportion), 637 were
unique, therefore considered as different strains, and were used for further phylogenetic
analysis. These were aligned to 46,917 genome sequences collected outside of the UAE
between January 10th and June 16th 2020 and deposited to the GISAID EpiCoV
database (https://www.epicov.org/).
As subset of genome sequences were selected for phylogenetic tree building,
including the 637 strains sequenced in this study, the 52 most closely related genome
sequences from the alignment analysis against the global 46,917 sequences, and 25
genome sequences also obtained from GISAID that were collected and sequenced in
Dubai, UAE, from January 29th to March 15th 2020. We built a maximum likelihood
phylogenetic tree using the Nextstrain pipeline; Augur v6.4.3 and MAFFT v7.455 for
multiple sequence alignment and IQtree v1.6.12 for phylogenetic tree construction (25).
FigTree v1.4.4 was used to visualize and annotate the phylogenetic tree. Clades were
defined following the Nextstrain nomenclature(16). Subclades were further defined in
this study based on common variants (>5%) in the UAE but is significantly rarely present
in the rest of the world (fisher exact p-value < 4e-82).
Samples with corresponding epidemiological data including patients’ addresses and
date of first sample collection were also used to generate median-joining networks for
each clades and subclades using PopART (Population Analysis with Reticulate Trees)
v1.7. L1-norm genetic distance was computed using the formula previously defined in
the influenza study by Poon, et al (2016)(13), reflecting the sum of the degree of
difference for each variant nucleotide position of any two samples.

the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB)(26). The tests were used to identify
variants that display substantial allele frequency differences between the two sets of
genomes sequences; UAE vs. rest of the world. Kruskai-Wallis test was used to compare
the RT-qPCR Ct values between clades and subclades.

The original structures (PDB format) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were downloaded from
Protein Data Bank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org/) with accession numbers, ORF3a: 6xdc,
Spike: 6vyb and NSP12:7bv2. Point mutations were introduced into each protein
sequence and generated the mutated sequence. The mutated sequence and the
corresponding original template protein structure were then taken as inputs for
SWISS-MODEL for Homology modeling. After the modeling was completed, the PDB
files of the target mutated proteins were obtained for further analysis. Subsequently, Ions
and waters are deleted from PDB files. The PDB files were then subjected to GROMACS
(Version: V5.1) and utilized for molecular dynamics simulation at the temperature 300K.
Gromacs output the free energy (KJ/mol) to measure the stability of candidate protein. A
smaller value of free energy indicates a higher stability of protein.

Figure 5. Co-infection with multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Evidence for
human-to-human transmission of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants were established using
the clade and sub-clade definitive viral genetic variants. Columns display the
de-identified sample ID that carried more than one SARS-CoV-2 viral variants in the
nasopharyngeal swab sampling (N=48). Color bar shows the viral clade assigned to the
individual, according to the consensus viral sequence, reflecting the dominant clade in
one sample. Rows indicate the eleven clade- definitive and eleven sub-clade definitive
variants. Heatmap color, ranging from red to blue, suggests the allelic proportion of the
derived allele of the iSNV. The ID of two longitudinal samples were marked in red.
