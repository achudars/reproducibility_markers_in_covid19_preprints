Abstract
The potential airborne transmission of COVID-19 has raised significant concerns regarding the
safety of musical activities involving wind instruments. However, currently, there is a lack of
systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments,
which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the
reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we
conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under
different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration
from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we
categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet,
French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a
comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition,
we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation
pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special
techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types
of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet
design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of
airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical
activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands,
music classes, etc.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major disruption to our economy and
social activities (Nyenhuis, Greiwe, Zeiger, Nanda, & Cooke, 2020; Seetharaman, 2020),
particularly to the entertainment industry, leading to a total shutdown of music production and
public events (France, 2020; Garcia et al., 2020). While businesses have started to recover, as of
today, with stringent preventive measures in place to minimize risk (Bartoszko, Farooqi, Alhazzani,
& Loeb, 2020; Cheng et al., 2020; Sommerstein et al., 2020), many such measures, including
mask-wearing, cannot be readily implemented to musical activities. Continuing these activities
without appropriate risk assessment and mitigation strategies can result in devastating
consequences (Chief, 2020; Lint, 2020). Specifically, a choir from Mount Vernon, Washington,
which kept a regular rehearsal for three weeks, had 45 members diagnosed with COVID-19, and
two died even with a standard social distancing followed (Chief, 2020). Another choir from
Amsterdam experienced a similar tragedy (102 out of 130 members fell ill, and four died) with a
late cancellation of their performance and without keeping a suggested social distance (Lint, 2020).
Such incidences provide strong evidence on the airborne transmission of COVID-19, which has
gained more and more recognition through a series of follow-up studies with controlled
experiments (Lednicky et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020). Particularly, as singing is shown to produce
significantly more aerosols than normal speaking and breathing characterized in the literature
(Johnson et al., 2011; Loudon & Roberts, 1968; Mürbe, Fleischer, Lange, Rotheudt, & Kriegel,
2020; Sommerstein et al., 2020), the aerosols from an asymptomatic singer can contain viruses,
potentially causing a “super spread” of COVID-19 in the proximity of the singer. Similar to singing,
it raises serious concerns that an exceedingly high dose of aerosols could be generated by
musicians playing various woodwind and brass instruments like that (~104 times of normal
breathing) reported for vuvuzela (Lai, Bottomley, & McNerney, 2011). However, so far, very few
studies have investigated the aerosol generation and assessed the corresponding risks during these
instrument plays. The existing ones related to this topic focus on examining airflows induced by
such instruments (Becher, Gena, & Voelker, 2020; Kähler & Hain, 2020; Spahn & Richter, 2020).
Becher et al. (2020) and Kähler & Hain (2020) showed that brass instruments only influence flow
within 0.5 m from the outlet while woodwind, especially flute, can yield flow movement distance
over 1.0 m beyond the outlet. Spahn & Richter (2020) evaluated the risk based on such flow
influence zone and provided the spacing rules for safer performance. Collaborating with 15
musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, our work provides the first systematic examination of
aerosol generation from 10 woodwind and brass instruments (Fig. S1) under music with various
dynamic levels and articulation patterns (Table 1) as well as the risks associated with these
instrument plays. We not only reveal the orders of magnitude variability of aerosol generation
across different instruments and musical patterns but also elucidate the connection of such aerosol
generation with the instrument design and breathing characteristics under different music plays.
Our findings can be further generalized to other woodwind and brass instruments not included in
the present study and for the safe arrangement of different musical performance settings.
2. Methods
2.1 Participants and involved instruments
Our experiment selects 15 healthy musicians (two females and 13 males) from the Minnesota
Orchestra aged between 35 and 60 as participants. Involved musical instruments include trumpet,
bass trombone, French horn, tuba, flute, piccolo, bassoon, oboe, clarinet, and bass clarinet, in total
10 types of musical instruments, which cover nearly all types of wind instruments used in

Orchestra. Among them, six types of instruments, including trumpet, French horn, flute, bassoon,
oboe, and clarinet, are played with two musicians. Each instrument performance consists of six
cases with the combination of three dynamic levels and two articulation patterns (Table 1),
covering the typical performance range of each instrument. For flute, additional tests are conducted
for two special techniques, i.e., tongue ram and jet whistle (with two variations).
2.2 Experimental setup
An aerodynamic particle sizer (APS, TSI model 3321) is used to measure the aerosol concentration
and size simultaneously under different respiratory activities, i.e., breathing and speaking, which
serve as baseline measurements and instrument performance (Table 1). The aerosol size
measurement of APS is calibrated to increase the accuracy using digital inline holography (DIH),
i.e., a high-resolution imaging system for in situ measurements of the particle distribution.
APS Measurements: APS measures particle size ranging from 0.5 μm to 20 μm. APS equips an
inner pump to provide a sucking-in flow with a flow rate of 5 L/min. Only about 20% of the
aerosols remain as sample flow for the measurements, and the rest of them are filtered as sheath
flow. The sample flowrate is measured using a Gilibrator (Sensidyne Gilian Gilibrator-2), and it
is 1.65 L/min (not 1 L/min mentioned by the manufacture manual). The aerosol concentration is
the ratio of a raw count of aerosols (in a unit of particles/L) over the sample flowrate of the APS
(in a unit of L/s), according to Eq. (1)
𝐶 = 𝑅𝑎𝑤 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡/𝑆𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒

(1)

where C is the equivalent concentration in a unit of particles/L.
It should be noted that the real emission rate (in a unit of particles/s) has a relationship with the
raw count of aerosols following Eq. (2).
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒

𝐸 = 𝑅𝑎𝑤 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 × (𝑆𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒)

(2)

where E is the corrected emission rate in the unit of particles/s, and the ratio of total flowrate over
sample flowrate is (5/1.65 = 3.03).
As shown in Fig. S2a, a plastic Y-funnel is used to collect particles, which has been used in related
aerosol studies (Asadi et al., 2019, 2020). Its convergent channel can improve the uniformity of
the airflow, which lowers the chances of aerosol deposition. The funnel size is adjusted
accordingly to ensure all particles are collected for each experiment (i.e., breathing, speaking, and
playing instruments with varying outlet sizes). Specifically, there are three-size funnels (i.e., small:
102 mm in diameter and 114 mm in height; medium: 140 mm in both diameter and height; large:
190 mm in diameter and 178 mm in height). A small size funnel is used for breathing and speaking
experiments. For the instrument experiments, as shown in Fig. S2b, we place the medium and large
funnels close to the instrument outlets and cover the outlets without direct contact to minimize the
aerosol deposition for most instruments (i.e., trumpet, piccolo, flute, oboe, bassoon, bass clarinet,
clarinet ). For those instruments with outlets much larger than the funnel (i.e., bass trombone, tuba,
French horn), we place the small-size funnel several centimeters inside the instrument outlets (i.e.,
bells) without direct contact. In addition, to minimize the resistance of the funnel to the flow, the
centers of instrument outlets and the funnel are aligned.
A 500-mm long silicon tube connects the funnel with APS for both baseline and instrument
measurements. The inner diameter of the tube matches the inlet of the APS of 12 mm. The

conductive tube is selected to minimize the aerosol depositions associated with electrostatic charge
during the transport, following the APS manufacturer’s instruction (TSI, 2004). After each test,
we monitor the concentration status LED signal of the APS to confirm there is no liquid film
formation inside the tube. Note that the APS equips an inner pump to suck the aerosols into it with
a total air flowrate of 5 L/min, and the corresponding flow speed inside the tube is about 0.74 m/s,
which is much higher than the flow speeds measured at outlets of the 10 musical instruments (~
0.25 m/s on average, measured at the outlet center using an anemometer). The velocity difference
provides a negative pressure zone near the funnel stem and tube, which guides the aerosols moving
into the APS and further minimizes the influence of aerosol leakage, aerosol deposition in the
funnel, and different flow profiles from the instruments on the final measurement results.
To mitigate the measurement uncertainty induced by extra movements during each test, a
tripod/hand is used to support the tube and funnel at a certain height. Such height can be adjusted
to accommodate different respiratory activities, including breathing, speaking, and playing
instruments. All the measurements are conducted in a room of 4.6 m (length) × 3.7 m (width) ×
3.4 m (height). The room is maintained with a low environmental dusty level of 0.6 particles/s
(significantly lower than the aerosol concentration from breathing, measured by APS of the
ambient environment) using a HEPA Air Scrubber (MultiPro Model AH2000). During the tests,
the funnel inlet is largely blocked by the participant’s face or the instrument outlet, which further
reduces the influence of ambient particles on the APS measurements.
APS calibration using DIH: APS measurements tend to provide a smaller size for liquid aerosols
due to evaporation (Johnson et al., 2011; Morawska et al., 2009) and have uncertainties in
particular size measurements due to the aerosol deformation (Baron, 1986; C. J. Tsai, Chen, Huang,
& Chen, 2004) and uncertainties in flowrate quantification (Pfeifer et al., 2016). To eliminate the
influence of such uncertainties on the measurements, we employ digital inline holography (DIH)
technique, i.e., a high-resolution 3D imaging system, for the calibration of the APS measurements.
DIH uses a coherent light source (e.g., laser) to illuminate a sample volume and a camera to capture
the patterns generated from interference between the light scattered by objects in the sample and
the un-scattered part of the light, referred to as holograms hereafter (Katz & Sheng, 2010). The
recorded holograms are then numerically reconstructed using different diffraction kernels to obtain
in-focus objects within the sample volume. DIH has been broadly used as a high-fidelity tool for
in situ measurements of particle concentration, size, and shape over a broad range of applications
(Beals et al., 2015; Graham & Nimmo Smith., 2010; Katz & Sheng, 2010; Kumar et al., 2019; Li,
Miller, Wang, Koley, & Katz, 2017; Shao, Li, & Hong, 2019; You et al., 2020). Particularly, DIH
has been recently used for in situ measurements of aerosol generation from human exhalation,
capable of capturing the presence of droplets and crystalline particles in the respiratory gas flow
as well as their concentration and size distribution (Shao et al., 2020). Specifically, in our
experiments, the DIH system (shown in Fig. S2c) consists of a He-Ne laser source (632 nm
wavelength), a three-axis spatial filter, a collimation lens, a 10X infinity-corrected objective, and
a camera operating with 2000 pixels x 2000 pixels active sensor with 10 frames/s. The calibration
is conducted by applying both APS and DIH to measure the aerosols generated by a nebulizer (TSI
Single Jet Atomizer 9302) under different back-pressure conditions (Table S1).
The size distribution histograms measured with APS and DIH are fitted using log-normal
distributions, and the corresponding mapping in terms of the transformations of aerosol size
between the two systems is derived. The calibrated aerosol diameter (𝐷P ) is obtained with the
aerosol diameter measured by APS (𝐷P0 ) based on Eq. (3).

where AR and SR represent the amplifying ratio and shrink ratio in the calibration (summarized in
Table S1), respectively.
2.3 Breathing and speaking measurements
The measurements of aerosol generation during normal breathing and speaking of the participants
are conducted to serve as baseline measurements to compare with those from the instrument play.
In the breathing measurements, the breathing frequency of each participant is synchronized using
a metronome at 76 beats. The same breathing pattern of two-beat nose inhalation followed by
three-beat mouth exhalation is used for each participant, similar to patterns used in the related
studies (Asadi et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2020). The corresponding breathing frequency for this
breathing pattern is 15.2 breaths/min breathing frequency, placed within the normal breathing
range (Tobin et al., 1983). Each breathing run lasts 30 s and is repeated for 20 times. It should be
noted that in between every five runs, the participant takes a one-minute break. During the break
time, we check the funnel to ensure that there is no visible vapor condensation on the funnel surface.
In the speaking measurements, the participant counts from 1 to 100 continually following a timer
placed in front of he/her, which is a common test used in the study of aerosol generation from
speaking (Chao et al., 2009; Loudon & Roberts, 1967). Each speaking run lasts 100 s and is
repeated five times with one-minute rest in between. During these measurements, the sound level
of each participant is recorded using a Decibel meter to help the participant maintain a level near
80 dB. It should be noted that the funnel used in the breathing and speaking measurements is 100
mm in bell diameter and a 75 mm distance between the funnel inlet and outlet. During the tests,
the participant places his/her nose above the upper edge of the funnel to ensure that only aerosols
generated through the mouth are collected and measured by the APS. In addition, the participant
is instructed to avoid contacting the funnel surface during the measurements to prevent vapor
condensation caused by the full sealing of the funnel. Furthermore, to reduce the ambient airflow
into the device, a face mask is used to cover the bottom half of the funnel, as shown in Fig. S2a.
2.4 Instrument measurements
We conduct aerosol measurements at the locations where the dominant (i.e., at least one order of
magnitude higher than other locations) aerosol leakage occurs during instrument plays using the
same standard music sample for all the instruments. The locations of dominant aerosol leakage are
determined through an initial probe of all possible air leakage locations for each instrument,
including main air outlets, in the vicinity of keyholes, and near the embouchure hole. For all the
brass and reed woodwinds, aerosols are primarily generated from their main outlets. For air-jet
instruments (i.e., piccolo and flute), we find that the aerosol concentrations from outlets and near
the embouchure hole are comparable. Therefore, the measurements are conducted at both locations
to make a detailed assessment of aerosol generation during flute plays.
The music sample, i.e., two-octave B flat major scale, is used by each participant to make a
consistent comparison of aerosol generation across different instruments. The sample is played
under three dynamic levels (loudness from p: soft to mf: loud and then to ff: very loud) and two
articulation patterns (slurred - connected and smooth, and articulated- short and separated), a
combination of which constitute six test cases including p-slurred, p-articulated, mf-slurred, mfarticulated, ff-slurred, and ff-articulated, as summarized in Table 1. Note that no accented notes are
used in articulated plays. During the tests, to keep the consistency among all the participants, the
participant plays the instrument following a metronome with two notes per beat. After 8 s

instrument performance (16 notes), the participant is instructed to hold the instrument at the same
location without blowing for another 12 s to ensure that APS collects all aerosols. Each test case
is repeated five times. In the instrument tests, funnels with different sizes are used according to the
instrument outlet dimension to ensure that the aerosols emitting from the outlets are completely
collected.
In addition, following the suggestion of musicians, we have conducted aerosol measurements near
the keyholes during bassoon plays with two special music pieces that are likely to cause more air
leakages near the lower keyholes due to frequent usage of corresponding keys. The pieces selected
are the first 17 s of the Bassoon Concerto in B-Flat Major (W.A. Mozart), K. 191, Allegro, and the
first 13 s of the bassoon cadenza in the second movement of Scheherazade, i.e., Kalendar Prince.

Note that one of the trumpet players only repeated three times instead of five times during his instrument
plays due to some unexpected equipment failures. However, we checked the statistical robustness of results
to ensure this small inconsistency of the measurements does not influence our experimental findings.

3. Results
3.1 Influence of musical instrument type on aerosol generation
The aerosol concentration generated from 10 orchestra instruments exhibits two orders of
magnitude variation (Fig. 1a), i.e., from ~20 to ~2400 particles/L covering the range of normal
breathing (~90 ± 65 particles/L) and speaking (~ 230 ± 95 particles/L) in the present study.
Specifically, tuba produces fewer aerosols than normal breathing, while the concentrations from
piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet stay within the range of normal breathing
and speaking. The musicians playing trumpet, oboe, and bass trombone tend to generate more
aerosols than speaking. Accordingly, as higher aerosol concentration leads to increased risk of
airborne disease transmission (Fennelly, 2020), we categorize these instruments into low,
intermediate, and high-risk levels based on a comparison of their aerosol concentrations with the
concentration span of normal breathing and speaking. Note that only the aerosols measured at the
main outlet of each instrument are used for comparison in this figure for consistency. For the airjet instruments (flute and piccolo), the aerosol leakage near the embouchure hole contributes to
about half of the total aerosol generation, as shown in Fig. S4. For bassoon plays using special
pieces that involve frequent usage of lower keys, the leakage near the corresponding keyholes is

also significant and contributes to about 40% of the total in the test cases (Fig. S4). Nevertheless,
with the consideration of the abovementioned special cases, the risk categorization of these
instruments remains the same. Furthermore, we attribute the large variability of aerosol
concentration from different instruments to the combined effects of sound production mechanisms
associated with instrument type (i.e., brass and woodwind), mouthpiece (i.e., air-jet, single reed,
and double reeds, Fig. S5), and tube structure (i.e., tube length, turnings, and valves) of each
instrument. The former two factors affect how aerosols are injected into the instrument, while the
latter influences aerosol transport inside the instrument tubes. Specifically, for brass, we observe
that the rank of aerosol concentration, i.e., trumpet > bass trombone > French horn > tuba, is
inversely correlated with the total tube length of each instrument (Table S2). As aerosols transport
in the tubes, they can deposit at their inner surfaces. A longer and narrower tube yields a higher
probability of such deposition, leading to a lower aerosol concentration at the outlet (Fennelly,
2020). For woodwinds, we find that their aerosol concentration seems to be strongly influenced by
its mouthpiece design. In particular, the air-jet woodwinds (i.e., piccolo and flute) produce the
lowest concentration as the respiratory jet impinges the edge of the embouchure hole at a steep
angle leading to high particle deposition near the inlet (Fig. S5a), similar to the aerosol deposition
(0.1-100 µm with a flow rate of 10-100 L/min) in a cascade impactor (P. J. Tsai, Uang, Wang, Wu,
& Shih, 2012). Such deposition due to direct impingement reduces gradually going from air-jet to
single-reed (i.e., clarinet and bass clarinet), then to double-reed woodwinds (i.e., oboe and bassoon)
as the flow into the main tube becomes more and more aligned the tube axis (Figs. S5b-c). Such
process is analogous to spray deposition, where deposition efficiency decreases as the
impingement angle of the spray lowers (Gilmore, Dykhuizen, Neiser, Roemer, & Smith, 1999).
Moreover, different from other instruments, air-jet woodwinds have air leakage near the mouths
during the regular plays (Fletcher & Rossing, 1991), which further reduces the concentration of
aerosols from the instrument outlet (Fig. S5a). Besides the mouthpiece, tube structure also plays a
role in the aerosol generation of woodwinds. Particularly, bassoon, despite being a double-reed,
exhibits the lowest concentration among the six woodwinds, mainly associated with its
significantly longer tube. Similarly, for the two single-reed woodwinds, bass clarinet produces
fewer aerosols than clarinet due to its extended tube length. For air-jet woodwinds, although the
tube length of piccolo is only half of flute, its bore size is half of flute, therefore, leading to a
comparable number of aerosols deposited in the tube as flute. Finally, comparing the brass and
woodwind with less than 7% difference in tube length, we find that bass trombone has an order of
magnitude higher aerosol concentration than bassoon. Such observation can be explained by the
specific mouthpiece (i.e., circular openings to the main tubes via a semi-spherical or conical cavity
(Fletcher & Rossing, 1991) of brass that results in considerably less deposition as the aerosols
enter the tube in comparison to reed instruments (Fig. S6).

plays. (a) Aerosol concentration levels measured at the outlets of 10 orchestra instruments. Such levels are
averaged across different dynamical levels, articulation patterns, and individuals. The green and red dashed

shaded regions represent the standard deviation (SD) of these measurements. (b) The average size (symbols)

ensemble-averaged statistics of the size variation here. Note that only the aerosols measured at the main
outlet of each instrument are used for comparison in this figure for consistency.

In contrast to concentration, the size distributions of aerosols from all the brass and woodwinds
are all approximately log-normal (Fig. S7), and their averages are within a close range, i.e., 1.93.1 μm (Fig. 1b). Remarkably, the span of aerosol size (characterized using the size standard

deviation) during instrument plays are generally broader than those from normal breathing and
speaking. We attribute such trend to the more vigorous exhalation involved in instrument plays
(Macfie, 1966), which can lead to the increase in size variation similar to those observed in heavier
breathing (Asadi et al., 2019). In addition, we find that the span of aerosol size varies more
significantly across different instruments compared to their average sizes. Particularly, for air-jet
woodwinds of similar straight tube structure and producing aerosols of similar concentration, the
span of aerosol size from flute is smaller than piccolo (Fig. S7i, j) owing to its longer and wider
tubes. Under such circumstances, aerosols transported in flute have longer residence time, and
aerosols of larger size are more likely to deposit on the tube inner surfaces (Table S3). However,
this size-dependent deposition does not seem to explain the trends observed in the other
instruments with more complex tube and inlet structures, i.e., reeds, turnings, and valves. Instead,
we observe a clear negative correlation between aerosol concentration and size variation for
instruments of similar types (i.e., brass and reed instruments) due to the span increase resulted
from a reduction in sample size (Watkins, 2017). This result suggests that with the increasing
complexity of instruments, the deposition appears to be insensitive to the size within the range of
our measurements (i.e., 1.4 to 20 μm), as reported (Asmatulu et al., 2017; Heyder, Gebhart, Rudolf,
Schiller, & Stahlhofen, 1986).
3.2 Influence of dynamic level and articulation pattern on aerosol generation
We investigate the aerosol production when playing different music using six music pieces
generated from a combination of three dynamic levels (p: soft, mf: medium loud, and ff: very loud)
and two articulation patterns (slurred and articulated). We find that the influence of dynamic levels
varies according to different instrument types (Fig. 2a). Based on the correlation of aerosol
concentration change with increasing dynamic level, we categorize the instruments into four
groups, i.e., positive correlation (denoted as p < mf < ff including oboe, bassoon, and clarinet),
negative correlation (denoted as p > mf ≳ ff including flute and piccolo), and no clear correlation
(including p < ff < mf for bass clarinet, trumpet, bass trombone, and French horn, and p ≅ mf ≅ ff
for tuba). Such trend can be explained by two competing factors that influence the change of
aerosol concentration with an increasing dynamic level. On the one hand, the augment of flow rate
associated with increasing blowing pressure at higher dynamic levels (Fletcher & Tarnopolsky,
1999; Fuks & Sundberg, 1996) can lead to more aerosol production, similar to those from heavy
breathing (Asadi et al., 2019). On the other hand, higher blowing pressure can also increase the
deposition and/or leakage of aerosols due to enhanced flow impingement at the inlets(Gilmore et
al., 1999) and inner walls of bifurcating tubes (Sippola & Nazaroff, 2005), particularly for the
instruments with convoluted tube and inlet structures, causing a decrease in the aerosol
concentration at the outlets. Specifically, for instruments consisting of primarily straight tubes (i.e.,
clarinet, oboe, and bassoon, see Figs. S1g, i, and j), the increase of aerosol production with
dynamic level is dominant, which yields a positive correlation. For air-jet woodwinds, considering
the steep-angle impingements at the inlet, the latter factor overwhelms the former, contributing to
a negative correlation. For the instruments with more complex tube structures (i.e., brass and bass
clarinet, see Figs. S1a-d and h), the competition of both factors complicates the correlation. We
observe that nearly no correlation with dynamic level for tuba potentially due to its exclusively
long tube and lowest aerosol production, and the peak of aerosol concentration at an intermediate
dynamic level for the other instruments in this group.

Fig. 2. Effects of dynamic level and articulation pattern on the aerosol concentration from different
wind instruments. (a) Aerosol concentration under three dynamic levels, i.e., p (piano, soft), mf (mezzo
forte, medium loud) and ff (fortissimo, very loud), and (b) under two articulation patterns, i.e., slurred
(sustained pieces) and articulated (separated pieces). In (a), all the instruments are divided into three groups,
i.e., positive correlation with dynamic level (denoted as 𝑝 < 𝑚𝑓 < 𝑓𝑓), negative correlation (𝑝 > 𝑚𝑓 ≳
𝑓𝑓), and no clear correlation (including 𝑝 < 𝑓𝑓 < 𝑚𝑓 and 𝑝 ≅ 𝑓𝑓 ≅ 𝑚𝑓), depending on how their aerosol
concentrations vary with respect to increasing dynamic levels. In (b), the influence of articulation patterns
on aerosol concentration is different for free-reed and reed instruments.

We also examine the variation of aerosol concentration with different articulation patterns, i.e.,
slurred (connected and smooth notes) and articulated (separate and short notes). For free-reed
instruments, the instrument plays with slurred patterns generally lead to higher aerosol production
than with articulated at the same dynamic level since slurred notes usually yield a higher average

flow rate than the articulated ones at the same dynamic level (Pàmies-Vilà, Hofmann, &
Chatziioannou, 2018). Noteworthily, we find that the aerosol concentration from tuba is insensitive
to the change of articulation patterns like that for different dynamic levels, potentially due to the
same reason. In comparison to free-reed instruments, the influence of articulation is more
complicated for reeds. Specifically, although a similar trend (i.e., higher aerosol concentration with
slurred pattern) is observed for bass clarinet and bassoon, the concentrations for oboe and clarinet
show an opposite dependence on articulation pattern. In general, during the play of reed
instruments, the tongue is pressed against reeds to make articulated notes. Such tongue placement
is likely to yield higher aerosol production like the higher concentration observed in the speaking
of ‘i’ in comparison to ‘a’ (Asadi et al., 2020). However, as aforementioned, the tube and inlet
structures can also influence the deposition of aerosols during their transport and, ultimately, the
concentration at the outlets. For oboe and clarinet with straight tubes (Fig. S8a), we expect that the
tongue movement induced enhancement of aerosol production overwhelms the loss of aerosols
during the transport, causing the reversed trend in comparison to that of free-reed instruments.
Comparatively, bass clarinet and bassoon with steep turnings (Fig. S8b) may result in stronger
aerosol deposition loss, particularly under the intense pressure oscillation during the plays using
articulated notes (Pàmies-Vilà et al., 2018). Such loss may offset the aerosol production
enhancement induced by tongue movement, lowering the corresponding aerosol concentration at
the outlets.
3.3 Influence of individual on aerosol generation
We investigate how the aerosol generation during instrument plays is influenced by normal
respiratory behaviors, i.e., breathing and speaking, of an individual. Such investigation is
conducted for six types of instruments, each of which is played by two musicians (Fig. 3a). For
free-reed wind instruments (brass and air-jet woodwinds), we find that a positive correlation of the
concentration of aerosols generated during instrument play with those from an individual’s
breathing and speaking. Such observation highlights that the individuals who naturally produce
more aerosols (Asadi et al., 2020), especially those referred to as “super emitters” (Fennelly, 2020),
tend to generate more when they play these instruments. However, for reed instruments, the
relation between individual respiratory behavior and instrument play becomes more complicated.
Specifically, clarinet, oboe, and bassoon yield positive, negative and no appreciable correlations,
respectively. We attribute this complication to the specific breathing control used by musicians
when playing reed instruments. In particular, different musicians have different performance
styles, and they can use lip pressure to control the opening between reed and embouchure edge,
instead of controlling the blowing pressure to for the adjustments of dynamic levels or articulation
patterns (Fletcher & Rossing, 1991). Such exhalation behavior is significantly different from
normal breathing, reducing the influence of individual natural breathing characteristics on
instrument aerosol production (Asadi et al., 2020). In addition, the aerosol size variation shows a
trend consistent with the concentration, i.e., positive correlation with individual respiratory
behaviors for free-reed instruments and no clear correlation for reeds (Fig. 3b), which consolidates
the abovementioned explanation. Specifically, for the free-reed instruments, the musicians that
tend to generate aerosols in a broader range of sizes also present larger aerosol size variation in
their instrument plays. In contrast, for the reed instruments that require the special lip pressure
control during the play, no consistent correlation is observed among the three reed instruments
(i.e., clarinet, oboe, and bassoon).

instruments. (a) Comparison of aerosol concentrations generated from two musicians playing the same
instrument along with their individual breathing and speaking measurements. The red, blue, and yellow
shaded areas highlight the instrument plays that show positive, negative, and no correlation with their
breathing and speaking behaviors in terms of aerosol generation, respectively. (b) Comparison of size
variation of the aerosols generated from two musicians playing the same instrument along with their
individual breathing and speaking measurements. Note that for French horn, aerosol size variations of

3.4 Influence of play techniques on aerosol generation
We also examine the influence of special techniques used in flute performance, including tongue
ram and jet whistle with two variations, on aerosol generation. Remarkably, in comparison to the
aerosol generation using basic flute techniques, we notice a drastic increase of aerosol
concentration when using special techniques, i.e., nearly 50 times increase using tongue ram and

about five and three times increases using different variations of the jet whistle, respectively (Fig.
4a). Such drastic increases in aerosol generation are inherently associated with exhalation
behaviors used for special techniques. These two special techniques require the musicians to
completely seal the embouchure hole with lips (Andrus & Shanley, 1980; Heiss, 1972). Such
behavior can minimize the air leakage near the mouth and shift the flow impingement point from
the edge of the embouchure hole to the inner surface of the main tube, reducing aerosol loss at the
inlet. Particularly, for tongue ram, the powerful and rapid tongue propelling into the embouchure
hole (Andrus & Shanley, 1980) can further increase the aerosol generation (Bake, Larsson,
Ljungkvist, Ljungström, & Olin, 2019). In addition to concentration, the average size and size
variation during the flute performance using special techniques decrease compared to those using
basic techniques (Fig. 4b). Specifically, the variation of aerosols generated using tongue ram
decreases with almost doubled probabilities at a small size range of 1.4 -2.0 μm than the basic
performance. Similar trends of increments in the concentration of small size range are also
observed in the performance of jet whistles with two variations. The significantly higher
concentration and small size of the aerosols when using the special techniques pose higher risks
of airborne disease transmission.

4. Conclusions and Discussion
In this study, we provide the first systematic investigation of aerosol generation for a variety of
wind instruments through the collaboration of 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra. We
find that aerosol generation from wind instrument plays is influenced by a combination of
breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Our results
show that the aerosol concentration from different instrument plays exhibits two orders of
magnitude variation. Specifically, tuba produces fewer aerosols than normal breathing, while the
concentrations from bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet stay within the
range of normal breathing and speaking. Trumpet, oboe, and bass trombone tend to generate more
aerosols than speaking. Accordingly, we categorize these instruments into low, intermediate, and
high-risk levels based on a comparison of their aerosol concentrations with the concentration span
of normal breathing and speaking. In contrast to concentration, the size distribution of aerosols
from all the brass and woodwinds are all approximately log-normal, and their averages are within
a close range, i.e., 1.9-3.1 μm. In addition, we find that the span of aerosol size varies more
significantly across different instruments compared to their average sizes. Moreover, the
dependence of aerosol production upon the dynamic level and articulation pattern varies for
different wind instruments. Particularly, only the instruments with straight tube design show an
increase of aerosol concentration with increasing dynamic level, while such trend is reversed for
air-jet instruments and becomes unclear for instruments with complex/very long tube structures.
For free-reed instruments, the slurred play tends to produce more aerosols than playing articulated
notes, while no clear trend with articulation pattern is observed for reeds. Furthermore, we find
that the individual’s natural respiratory behaviors can positively influence the aerosol generation
during instrument plays. However, such dependence only holds for free-reed instruments, not for
reeds due to the special lip control used in the play of such instruments. Finally, we notice a drastic
increase in aerosol concentration during flute performance with special techniques, i.e., nearly 50
times increase using tongue ram and about five and three times increases using different variations
of the jet whistle, respectively.
The findings in our study can be generalized for understanding and estimating the aerosol
generation from other musical instruments that are not included in the present study. For example,
single-reed instrument like saxophone with steep turnings near its inlet and outlet is likely to
produce a relatively lower level of aerosols, and its aerosol generation may be insensitive to the
variation of dynamic level and individual respiratory behaviors like those observed in bass clarinet.
The brass instrument like cornet with comparable tube length with trumpet is likely to produce a
high level of aerosols, and the performance with cornet may generate more aerosols with slurred
notes than using articulated notes and have a positive correlation in individual respiratory
behaviors. In general, our findings can provide valuable insights into the risk assessment of
airborne disease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies (e.g., seating
arrangement and ventilation) for different musical activities involving the usage of wind
instruments, including orchestras, community and worship bands, classes in music conservatories,
etc. Specifically, for the activities involving high-risk level wind instruments (i.e., trumpet, bass
trombone, oboe, etc.), extra preventive measures such as a reduction in occupancy, additional

social distancing, and ventilation enhancement are needed in comparison to playing instruments
with lower risk levels.
Note that different musicians have different performance styles when they are playing the same
music piece, particularly for reed instrument plays, which may affect the aerosol generation levels.
Specifically, based on the performance styles, musicians have their own preferences on reed
selection (e.g., reed width, reed hardness, etc.) that can potentially influence aerosol generation.
For example, as to the clarinet performance, some musicians prefer to adjust the blowing pressure
to change the dynamic level and articulation pattern, while some alter the mouthpiece pressure
instead, which may lead to substantial difference in aerosol generation as shown in the
complicated individual effect in Fig. 3. In addition, the hardness of a reed varies as it ages and with
the change of temperature and humidity, which may also contribute to variations in aerosol
generation. All the aforementioned factors can add uncertainties to our findings. To obtain a more
accurate assessment of airborne transmission during wind instrument plays, it is desirable to
integrate our findings with the information of instrument-generated flows and ambient flows
(including both ventilation and natural convection) under specific settings. Such information can
be derived from in situ measurements of flow and aerosol transport and the numerical simulations
in the future.

Supplementary Figure 4

Fig. S4 | The aerosol concentration measured at different locations during flute and bassoon
plays. For flute play using the standard music sample, the aerosol concentrations measured near
the embouchure hole and main outlet are 51 particles/L and 44 particles/L, respectively. For
bassoon play with special music pieces, the aerosol concentrations measured near the keyholes
and main outlet are 26 particles/L (24 particles/L for piece one, and 28 particles/L for piece two)
and 37 particles/L, respectively. Note that for the aerosol measurements near the lower keyholes
during bassoon plays, two special music pieces which are likely to cause more air leakages near
the lower keyholes are selected due to frequent usage of corresponding keys. The pieces used are
the first 17 s of the Bassoon Concerto in B-Flat Major (W.A. Mozart), K. 191, Allegro, and the
first 13 s of the bassoon cadenza in the second movement of Scheherazade, i.e., Kalendar Prince.

Supplementary Figure 5

Fig. S5 | Illustrations of three types of mouthpieces for woodwinds. (a) Air-jet mouthpiece used
by flute and piccolo. In most situations (Putnik, 1973), the generated aerosols from the mouth
directly impinge onto the edge of the embouchure hole with a steep angle (marked by the red
dashed lines in the image). This process can lead to a large amount of deposition and air leakage.
(b) Single-reed mouthpiece used by clarinet and bass clarinet. The aerosols move into the tube
through the opening between the edge and reed with a shallower angle in comparison to that in the
air-jet woodwinds (marked by the red dashed lines in the image). (c) Double-reed mouthpiece used
by oboe and bassoon. The generated aerosols from mouth transport into the tube via the opening
between two reeds. The airflow is well aligned with these two reeds.

The residence time (𝑇R ) and deposition time (𝑇D ) of the aerosol in the tube are estimated using Eq.
S1 and Eq. S2.
𝑇R = 𝐿/𝑉

(Eq. S1)

where L is the tube length of the instrument, and V is the air speed inside the tube. Note that the
inlet flowrate for flute and piccolo is assumed to be the same. The air speed inside the flute is set
to 1 m/s for the calculation of residence time, which within the range of below 3 m/s (Bamberger,
2002).
𝑇R = 𝑅/𝑉t

(Eq. S2)

where R is the half of the inner diameter of the tube (i.e., half of bore size), and 𝑉t is the terminal
velocity of the aerosol, as given in Eq. S3.
𝑉t =

𝑔𝐷𝑃 2
18𝜇

(𝜌P − 𝜌)

(Eq. S3)

where μ is the air viscosity; g is the acceleration due to gravity, 𝐷P is the aerosol diameter; 𝜌P and
𝜌 are the density of aerosols (assuming to be water droplets in this case) and air, respectively. As
shown in the Table, for flute, the deposition time of large aerosols (𝐷P > 8 μm) is smaller than the
corresponding residence time, indicating those large aerosols tend to deposit in the tube before
they move out from the instrumental outlet. However, for piccolo, the residence time for the
aerosols cross a wide range of sizes is smaller than their deposition time, suggesting that all
aerosols can travel out from the outlet. Such trends consolidate the wider size distribution of
piccolo than flute in Figs.S7 i and j.
