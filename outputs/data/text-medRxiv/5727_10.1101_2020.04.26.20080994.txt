Abstract

By 29th April 2020, COVID-19 had caused more than 3 million cases across more than 200 countries.
And most countries with significant outbreaks had introduced social distancing or “lockdown”
measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent,
these measures can be lifted.
By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases
and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both
before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 29th April 2020, and covered 73
countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling.
The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those
previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases
available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the
restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions
– R0 0.77 (95%CI 0.68-0.87), based on cases and 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.88) based on mortality.
Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing
periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could
have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly,
restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile
with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.

Introduction

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).1 The spread of
COVID-19 has already been the defining event of 2020.1–3 Over the past two decades, two other
emerging pathogenic coronaviruses capable of causing life-threatening disease in humans and
animals had been identified, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV).4 While both of these prior novel
coronaviruses caused significant outbreaks, they appear to have been more lethal and less
transmissible and did not cause pandemics.
SARS-CoV-2 in contrast has spread through most of the world and caused most countries to restrict
travel, close large parts of industry, restructure economies, and focus on disease control. Up to 29th
April there have been 3,053,457 cases of COVID-19 confirmed and 214,862 deaths in individuals
testing positive.5 Cases have been reported in 207 countries.
“Lockdown” measures required to control the spread of the virus have been expensive in terms of
reducing economic activity and painful through restricting social interaction, but, in late-April, there
continue to be large numbers of mortalities in most parts of the world.5 The question of when and
how far to ease the restrictions is, therefore, urgent. Planning how and when to lift restrictions
requires an understanding of the transmissibility of the virus and effectiveness of the social
distancing and lockdown measures taken across the world to date. The difference between the
spread of the virus without restrictions and the spread or reduction in rates of infection under
lockdown allow an estimate of how effective lockdown measures have been, and therefore the
degree to which these measures can be relaxed without disease resurgence.
This paper uses publically available data from multiple countries to model the spread of COVID-19,
both before and under the lockdown, and estimate the scope for relaxing the current restrictions.

Methods
Data

Data on the numbers of new confirmed cases of COVID-19, and numbers of deaths reported for
people known to have COVID-19, for each day up to 29th April 2020, were obtained from the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website
( https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distributionCOVID-19-19-cases-worldwide ) on the 29th April. Mortality data was used for countries that had
reported at least 100 deaths, and numbers of cases for those where at least 1000 confirmed cases
had been reported. These data series were trimmed, discarding days before a total of 10 deaths or
100 cases had been reported. That left 73 countries with sufficient data to fit models.
Both these types of data have important limitations, missing varying proportions of individuals in
each country and over time. The limitations and changes in testing strategies make the data on
confirmed cases particularly problematic, while the mortality data have an intrinsic lag that reduces
their sensitivity to recent changes. Nevertheless, most countries have systematic testing of
hospitalized cases and most mortality occurs in hospitals, making disease specific mortality

potentially less biased by testing policies that confirmed cases. The mortality data is therefore
prioritised in the interpretation when the results conflict. Data for each included country were
carefully reviewed for inconsistencies and artefacts. The data for China on 18th April showed a spike
that appears to be an artefact of redefinition, and was discarded. Iran reported nothing on the 4th
April and a spike on the 5th, so those reports were split evenly across the two days.

Analysis

The data were loaded into R 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019)6 and separate sets of regression models were
fitted for each of mortality and cases in each of the countries. Preliminary examination of the data
showed that residuals around models fitted to almost all the datasets were overdispersed relative to
the Poisson distribution. All the models therefore used the negative binomial error family, with a log
link function.
The aim was to calculate exponential growth rates for each country before and under lockdown.
Each country introduced restrictions in a different pattern, so rather than attempting to interpret
those rules, and how people responded to them, the data were used to identify periods of steady
increase and decline. While the absolute numbers of cases and deaths are shocking, the daily
numbers are very small proportions of the national populations and therefore the numbers of
susceptible individuals are almost constant. This means that during periods of constant behaviour
exponential trajectories can be expected, whether these trajectories are increasing or decreasing.
Two generalised linear models were fitted for each combination of start and finish date at least 10
days apart. The first model simply contained a linear term for time, the second one also had a
quadratic term for time. BIC, the Bayesian information criterion7 was calculated and compared for
each pair of models. The choice of BIC as the criterion for identifying exponential periods was
entirely pragmatic. Exploratory analyses using Akiake’s Information Criterion (AIC)8 showed this
selected very short intervals, and the small sample correction, AICc, worsens this problem. In BIC the
penalty for additional parameters is proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of
datapoints, so it is less eager to increase the complexity of models as sample size increases.
Linear models were considered potential representations of the initial exponential growth phase if
they: i) used data ending no later than 5 days before the day that the maximum number of deaths,
or cases, was observed; 2) had positive point estimates of slope; and 3) had BIC lower than their
parallel quadratic model. If multiple models satisfied these criteria, the model where BIC was
furthest below that of its quadratic equivalent was used. The model for the exponential period
under lockdown was similarly chosen, but with the requirements that its data not begin before five
days after the finish of that for the first model and its BIC be lower than that of its quadratic
equivalent. No requirement was placed on its slope, so this could be negative or positive, and even
larger than that for the first period, if the data suggested that the spread of the disease had
accelerated. One exponential period was identified in the case data from 18 countries, and two
exponential periods for 53 others. For the mortality data, these numbers were 3 and 35.
The five day interval was chosen after exploration of the Spanish and Italian data, where tight
lockdowns were associated with obvious changes in the trajectory. These changes were particularly

visible because of the large numbers of infections in those countries at that time. This interval does
not need capture the whole course of multiple generations of infections, it merely needs to contain
the bulk of the time over which the age-structure, in days since catching, of the infected individuals
changes. Adjusting this interval changes the estimates, and estimability, of individual countries’
trajectories but produces similar overall patterns.
To provide a visual check on these models, a generalised additive model (GAM) of the whole
trajectory was also fitted9. In most cases, the ends of this curve are similar to the exponential
pattern match, and it is not surprising that the transition period does not. It should be noted that
GAMs favour steady patterns of change and curvature, while many of the changes in behaviour were
quite sudden. For a few countries the mismatch between the GAM and exponential models gave,
subjectively, cause for concern. These are indicated in the figures.
The slopes, and confidence intervals around them, are of limited direct use. However, dividing the
natural logarithm of 2 by them gives the doubling time of epidemic growth or halving time of its
decay.
Reproduction (R) number and estimates of effect of “lockdown”

R0 , the basic reproduction number for the disease, is the expected number of people one infected
person would cause in a naïve population. It is critical to disease spread: if it is above 1 an epidemic
will accelerate, below that the outbreak will fade away. Because these data include only a fraction of
the cases, R0 in each country, cannot be directly estimated from them. Instead, the R0 library10 was
used to apply the method of Wallinga and Lipsitch11 to convert the estimates, and associated
uncertainties, of the exponential trajectories into estimates of R0 both before and under lockdown.
This approach requires an estimated distribution for the serial interval of infection. The lognormal
with mean 4 days and standard deviation of 2.9 days calculated by Nishiura, Linton and
Akhmetzhanov12 was used. While changing this distribution changes the individual estimated values
for R0, the relationship between the estimates before and under lockdown is relatively insensitive to
plausible choices.
Three estimates of the scope for relaxing lockdown were then considered. The first was a simple
ratio of the slopes before and under lockdown. This indicates the number of days under lockdown
required to balance a single day of previous behaviour. The second, the difference between R0 on
lockdown and 1 is the proportion that contact under lockdown could be increased without causing a
resurgence of the epidemic. As the continuing behaviour is quite different from that prevented,
partly because much of what is permitted is within the domestic environment and most of that
restricted is external to it, this measure is relatively uninformative and not discussed further. The
third measure was calculated as:
(1-R0lockdown)/(R0before-R0lockdown)
Provided R0lockdown is less than both 1 and R0before, this gives an estimate of the proportion of the
behaviour, prevented by the lockdown, that can be resumed and result in an overall R0 equal to 1.
The first and third approaches give different results because daily changes combine multiplicatively.
An example that demonstrates this would be for a disease with a generation time of 1 week that had
R0of 2 initially and ½ under lockdown: alternate weeks of doubling and halving would oscillate

around a constant value, with a mean contact rate of 1.25, higher than the continuous R of 1 that
would produce stability. Counterintuitively, that suggests more activity overall might be possible
under a strategy of intermittent lockdown. Confidence intervals around each estimate were
generated by drawing 1000 values from the relevant model parameter distributions.
Results are presented for 73 countries. Because so many countries were considered, some results
can be expected to appear significant by chance and caution is needed in interpreting individual
results. The discussion below will therefore concentrate on general patterns across multiple
countries.

Results

Figure 1 shows trajectories for the five countries with the highest number of deaths in this dataset,
and table 1 parameter estimates for them. The graphs for the remaining countries are in the
supplementary material. It can be seen that the chosen intervals of exponential growth are in the
early stages of the epidemic, which fits with the behavioural change to be expected, and that was
intended, as regulations were imposed and public awareness of the urgency of the problem spread.
For cases in the USA, the second exponential phase is estimated to probably be another period of
exponential growth, though at a slower rate than the initial period. However, daily mortality does
seem to have declined in the USA. The confidence intervals around the exponential models are
noticeably narrower than those around the GAMs, this is largely due to the information the GAMs
require for the extra parameters that describe their curvature.
Visual inspection of the plots suggest that the method has selected subperiods that do not seem
representative for cases in 5 countries (China, Greece, Japan, Morocco, and Turkey) and for
mortality for 3 (Indonesia, Japan, and Turkey). These results are included, but indicated, in the
figures. The models ignored the first, small, outbreak in Singapore and picked up only the larger
growth since then.
For Armenia, Belarus, Brazil, Colombia, Kuwait, Mexico and Panama, the initial exponential growth in
numbers of cases appears to have been followed by a brief period of decline before the growth
resumed. This pattern also appears in the mortality data for Brazil, India and Poland. And the models
miss an early period of rapid decline in new cases in Denmark, focussing on the subsequent slower
decline. Conversely, for cases in the Netherlands, and mortality in Germany, an initial period of slow
decline was selected despite the later data appearing to decline more rapidly. However, while
interesting, all these patterns should be treated with caution.
Supplementary Table 1 contains the estimated slopes, and standard errors, for the two best
exponential models of cases and mortality trajectories in each model. As doubling times are more
immediately interpretable, these are shown (Figure 2A). Many of these are too imprecise to be
useful. However, for those countries with sufficient data, estimates of doubling times from mortality
data are generally around 2 to 5 days. The estimates of halving time under lockdown (Figure 2B) are
generally over 7 days, and much higher than the equivalent pre-lockdown doubling times. This
impression is confirmed by inspection of individual trajectories, most of which decline more slowly
than they increase.

The estimates of R0 contain essentially the same information as those of doubling times. The
definition of the initial exponential period requires all the point estimates of R0 to be greater than 1,
though the lower bounds of some of the confidence intervals fall below that threshold (Figure 2C
and Supplementary Table 1). Almost all the values under lockdown (Figure 2D) are between 0.6 and
1.5. There are only 6 countries (Italy, France, Iran, China, Czechia, and Morocco) where the upper
bound of the estimate of R0 for the mortality data is below 0.9, though this is also true for the case
data of 15 countries.

Because it is such a short time since most countries have introduced restrictions and changed the
behaviour of their populations, there is a lot of uncertainty in the estimated trajectories under
lockdown. But what evidence there is (Figure 3) suggests that periodical release of lockdown beyond
one week in each month is very likely to result in the acceleration of the epidemic in many countries.
And even this is based on the assumption that behaviour during intermittent releases from
lockdown resembling typical behaviour in the period before the behavioural changes associated with
the COVID19 epidemics.

For each country the exponential rate calculated before lockdown was divided by that under
lockdown to give a mean and 95% confidence interval. Black is again based on mortality and red on
confirmed cases. Thin lines and hollow points indicate countries where plots of the modelled

second period than the first. The vertical dotted line shows that there is little evidence for believing
that relaxing lockdown for one week (during which previous behaviour would be resumed) each
month would be consistent with stopping the epidemic.

Similarly, these data show that few countries seem to be in a position to confidently ease their
lockdowns, (Figure 4).Only for Italy, France, Spain, Iran and China, do models of both the case and

mortality data exclude 0 from the 95% confidence intervals around their estimates of the proportion
of easing of restrictions that would not raise R0 above 1. For five other countries, the mortality
models capture their reported success in containing COVID-19, but the models of numbers of cases
do not. Resuming even 20% of currently prevented behaviour looks extremely ambitious in most
countries, with even a 5% easing appearing potentially risky in many of them.

evidence for it being sustainable to resume more than 20% of discontinued activity without the
epidemic resuming its spread.

Discusssion

These analyses are, by their nature, provisional and attempting to provide estimates and predictions
from limited datasets. The models differ from most of the infectious disease models that have been
applied to the COVID epidemics: they are based entirely on behaviour observed during the present
pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and do not incorporate any assumptions based on other respiratory viruses.
Only the conversion of the slope parameters to estimates of R0 uses a previously estimated
distribution of generation times. This simplicity avoids reliance on the uncertain assumptions,
necessary for more traditional epidemiological models, instead increasing the confidence intervals
are the estimates. Despite this, a surprisingly clear picture is visible: if COVID-19 had been only
slightly more transmissible the current lockdown measures would have been unable to halt the
epidemic in Europe. It is also not clear that it actually has been stopped in many data-rich countries.
Where it has been stopped, the margins for loosening the controls are frighteningly thin. And the
slow rates of decline in mortality suggest uncomfortable lower bounds on future mortality:
sustaining a 10% per day decline, a rate faster than the best estimate for almost all the lasting
declines in these data, implies that there will be a total of another 9 times as many deaths to come
as were reported yesterday; 5% per day increases that to 19 times.
There has been talk of lockdown being “a cure worse than the disease”, but it is not a cure. At 5%
per day it will take 35 days to claw back from 600 to 100 deaths per day; and another 45 to then get
down to 10. If 10% per day could be sustained it would only require 18 plus 20 days. But many
countries are not yet clearly past, or even close to, the peak. That suggests easing in the near future
will imply continuing mortality, and substantial easing is very likely to require the rapid re-imposition
of lockdown.
R0, or more precisely Rt, seems to be the key to this problem: until and unless a vaccine or effective
treatment becomes available, we need a liveable way to keep R below 1. Lockdown, to a point
beyond what most societies would have previously imagined accepting, can barely contain the
disease’s spread. It is hard to see it continuing indefinitely. These data suggest that unless a vaccine
becomes rapidly available, discussions around exit strategy from current restrictions therefore need
to move on from optimistic concepts of returning rapidly to normal activity. The data is more
consistent with a need to adopting a “new normal” that can provide the optimal balance between
allowing economic activity while ensuring very substantial reductions in prior social contacts (at least
90% reductions according to our best estimates). It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe
what the components of a new normal may be but discussions will include continuing social
distancing, public use of face-coverings, testing, tracking and isolating infected individuals and
contacts and widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals among other considerations.13–15

In summary, a simple analysis based on the behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date across 73
countries suggests remarkably consistent effects of both exponential growth and slow decline in
cases and mortality. Without a vaccine, these estimates are incompatible with a return to previous
activities post “lockdown”.
