Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China) were respectively
enrolled in this study. In addition, 91 other patients with pneumonia and 807 healthy subjects
were included as controls. Findings: We found that the levels of TT3 and TSH were lower in
COVID-19 patients than control groups (p<0·001). Within the group of COVID-19 patients,
61.9% patients (52/84) presented with thyroid function abnormalities. We found a larger
proportion of patients in severe condition exhibited thyroid dysfunction than mild/moderate
cases (74·6% vs. 23·8%, p < 0·001). Patients with thyroid dysfunction tended to have increased
interval time for negative conversion of viral nucleic acid (14·1 ± 9·4 vs. 10·6 ± 8·3 days, p =
0·088). To note, thyroid dysfunction was also associated with decreased lymphocytes (p <
0·001) and increased CRP (p = 0·002). In 7 patients with dynamic changes of thyroid function,
we observed the levels of TT3 and TSH gradually increased and reached normal range without
thyroid hormone replacement at Day 30 post-admission. The correlation between TT3 and TSH
level seemed to be positive rather than negative in the early stage, and gradually turned to be
negatively related over time. Interpretations: Thyroid function abnormalities are common in
COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. This might be caused by virus attack and
damage to the thyroid-pituitary axis. Therefore, more attention should be paid to thyroid
function during treatment of COVID-19, and close follow-up is also needed after discharge.

Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread worldwide and led to the
declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health
Organization (WHO) 1-3. As of June 14, 2020, a total of 7, 844, 978 cases have been confirmed
worldwide, among them, 428, 045 people have died of COVID-19. Patients infected with
COVID-19 display mainly symptoms similar with pneumonia such as fever, fatigue, cough,
shortness of breath

4,5

. And many patients have symptoms outside of the respiratory system

including poor appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, palmus, and chest distress

4,5

. The main

management of COVID-19 infection is supportive, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) induced respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality 4,6,7.
Severe and complex effects on several human organs and systems including respiratory,
immune, digestive, circulatory, hepatic, renal, and hematological systems have been reported
in COVID-19 patients

4-8

. Whether COVID-19 affects human thyroid function remains

unknown. Thyroid dysfunction was identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
patients, which was caused by another strain of coronavirus. Recently, Brancatella et al.
reported the first case of subacute thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection 9. Both indicate that
the thyroid gland may also be a target organ of SARS-CoV-2.
In the present study, 84 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital,
Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Hangzhou, China) were respectively enrolled. In
addition, 91 other patients with pneumonia and 807 healthy subjects were included as controls.
The thyroid function in COVID-19, pneumonia patients and healthy subjects was compared,
and its relationship with disease severity, interval time for negative conversion of viral nucleic
acid, auto-antibodies, leukocytes, inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines were also
investigated to uncover the underlying clinical value of thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, the
dynamic changes of thyroid function during recovery were analyzed to depict the development
of thyroid dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
Participants
There were 96 hospitalized patients definitely diagnosed as COVID-19 according to WHO
interim guidance

10

in the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine

(Hangzhou, China). All the COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital in January 22st to
March 16st, 2020. Among them, 85 patients had detected thyroid function after admission. One
patient was excluded due to pregnancy. In total, 84 COVID-19 patients were finally enrolled
in this retrospective study. Meanwhile, 91 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 807 healthy
subjects were also included as controls. These 91 non-COVID-19 cases were matched age,
gender, and clinical classification with COVID-19 patients, who were infected by bacteria,

fungus, and virus at the same period.
Clinical classification of COVID-19 was according to the Handbook of COVID-19
Prevention and Treatment

11

, and severe cases were judged when met any of the following

criteria: 1) respiratory rate over 30 breaths / min; 2) oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at a rest state; 3)
arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg. Besides,
patients with > 50% lesions progression within 24 to 48 hours in lung imaging should be
regarded as severe cases. All the cases were obtained with informed consent. The research was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School
of Medicine.
Data Collection and Procedures
We compared age, gender, and thyroid function including triiodothyronine (TT3),
thyroxine (TT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) among COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and healthy subjects.
The association between thyroid function and disease severity, inflammatory biomarker
(leukocytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6,
interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ), auto-antibodies (thyroglobulin antibody,
thyroid peroxidase antibody), and interval time for negative conversion of viral nucleic acid
were analyzed. We also studied the dynamic changes of thyroid function during patients’
recovery period.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS (version 21·0) (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
and R language (Version 3·6·3). Pearson chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
were used to analyze the characteristics and thyroid function among COVID-19, non-COVID19 pneumonia patients and healthy subjects, and to establish the factors associated with
dysfunction of thyroid. Pearson correlation was performed in the correlation analysis. In
addition, a polynomial regression curve was fitted between time after hospitalization and TSH
or TT3 levels. For all analyses, p < 0·05 was regarded as statistically significant.

A total of 84 hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were recruited in our study. All
84 COVID-19 patients had record of TT3, TT4, and TSH at admission, with 22 patients having
complete record of thyroid function including FT3 and FT4. We analyzed the association
between FT3 and TT3 and found that FT3 was positively correlated with TT3 (p < 0·001)
(Figure S1) indicating that changes of FT3 can be reflected TT3 to a certain extent.
Among the COVID-19 patients, 63 patients were clinically classified as severe. The mean
age of COVID-19 patients was 57·3 ± 14·5 years old, and 63% (53/84) were male, no
significance was found when compared with non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients or healthy
subjects (Table 1). Based on quantification of thyroid hormones, a total of 52 (52/84, 61·9%)
COVID-19 patients were defined as thyroid dysfunction. Among them, only two patients had
increased TT4 and decreased TSH levels, while the others had lower than normal range on
either TT4, TT3, or TSH.
Thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients
We analyzed the levels of TT4, TT3, and TSH on admission in COVID-19, non-COVID19 pneumonia patients and healthy subjects. The level of TT3 in COVID-19 patients (1·02 ±
0·32 nmol/L) was lower than that in healthy subjects (1·59 ± 0·24 nmol/L) (p < 0·001), but
similar with non-COVID-19 patients (0·92 ± 0·38 nmol/L) (p=0·59) (Table 1). There was no
obvious difference for TT4 between COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p = 0·391)
(Table 1). The thyroid gland is an endocrine organ negatively regulated by TSH which is
secreted by the adenohypophysis. However, in COVID-19 cases, TSH level surprisingly
decreased by a lower extent (0·62 ± 0·62 mIU/L) as compared to non-COVID-19 patients (1·07
± 0·94 mIU/L) and healthy subjects (1·55 ± 0·94 mIU/L) (p < 0.001) (Table 1). Correlation
analysis showed that the levels of TT3 and TSH were positively correlated, instead of
negatively related, in COVID-19 patients (R = 0·575, p < 0·001) (Figure 1).
Analysis of clinical values for thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients
COVID-19 patients were further divided into thyroid dysfunction group and normal group
according to TT3, TT4, and TSH levels. No obvious difference was found in age and sex
between two groups (Table 2). Abnormal thyroid dysfunction was more common in severe
cases (74·6%) than mild/moderate cases (23·8%) (p < 0·001) (Table 2). Interestingly, thyroid
dysfunction tended to be associated with longer interval time for negative conversion of viral

nucleic acid (14·13 ± 9·39 vs. 10·56 ± 8·29 days, p = 0·088). Besides, increased levels of
leucocytes (p < 0·001), neutrophils (p < 0·001), CRP (p = 0·002) and PCT (p = 0·054), and
decreased level of lymphocytes (p < 0·001) were more prevalent in thyroid dysfunction group.
Meanwhile, we did not find any significance in auto-antibodies (thyroglobulin antibody,
thyroid peroxidase antibody) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ) (Table
2).
The development of thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients
In order to illustrate the development of thyroid dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2, we
analyzed 7 patients with records of thyroid function during their recovery period. All 7 patients
had lower than normal range of TSH levels on admission, and none of them was treated by
glucocorticoid or thyroxine. We observed that the levels of TT3 and TSH gradually increased
during 2 months after hospitalization (Figure 2). At Day 30 post-admission, all the patients’
TT3 and TSH levels recovered without thyroid hormone replacement (Figure 2). We further
found TT3 and TSH levels seem to be altered from positive correlation to negative over time,
indicating a recovery of pituitary-thyroid axis. However, given limited patient number, the p
values did not achieve significance (Figure 3).

Discussion
COVID-19 is an infectious illness that has caused a pandemic worldwide. As a novel type
of disease with high infectivity and mortality, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 has not been
fully uncovered. A number of studies report the severe and complex effects of COVID-19 in
several human organs and systems including respiratory, immune, digestive, circulatory,
hepatic, renal, and hematological systems 7. However, whether COVID-19 affects human
thyroid function remains unknown. Here we report the influence of COVID-19 on thyroid
function. We found the COVID-19 patients had lower levels of TT3 and TSH than control
groups. Thyroid dysfunction correlated with disease severity, decreased lymphocytes and
increased CRP, and tended to be associated with interval time for negative conversion of viral
nucleic acid. We also found that thyroid dysfunction in COVID-19 patients may recover
without thyroid hormone replacement within 30 days.
Thyroid hormones are tightly related to pituitary function by TSH, and regulated by the

negative feedback of pituitary-thyroid axis. Here we found that the negative feedback had
disappeared in COVID-19 patients. Studies from SARS reported that the serum level of TSH
and some other hormones were lower than normal range in SARS patients 12. Severe pathologic
injury in follicular epithelial cells with follicular distortion and collapse was found in thyroid
glands of SARS patients 13. After investigating the endocrine cells in the pituitary gland of five
SARS patients, Wei et al. found that TSH positive cells were significantly decreased 14. These
findings suggested that endocrine cells of the adenohypophysis may be attacked and damaged
by coronavirus. This may partially explain why secretion of TSH cannot be stimulated by the
negative feedback loop under the circumstance of reduced T3 and T4.
The underlying mechanism of damaged thyroid and pituitary function is still uncertain,
which may be multifactorial and complex. Direct cytopathic effects induced by virus is a major
factor 15,16. The wide distribution of COVID-19 nucleic acid in respiratory tract, saliva, feces,
and breastmilk indicates that direct viral attack to the target cells may be an important reason
11,17-19

. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor providing the main entry site

for SARS-CoV to invade human cells, which facilitates direct damage of virus through the
course of infection 20,21. Li et al. recently reported that ACE2 was highly expressed in thyroid
22

, suggesting that the thyroid gland was a potential target for direct attack of COVID-19. Our

study showed that thyroid dysfunction tended to be associated with interval time for negative
conversion of viral nucleic acid, indicating virus infection and replication may account for the
decreased T3 and TSH. Meanwhile, TT3 and TSH levels on admission were positively
correlated, suggesting that the viral damage to both thyroid and pituitary glands may be similar.
Indirect injury, such as immune mediated damage of the severe inflammatory response,
also takes part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 8. ARDS is the main cause of mortality of
COVID-19 4,6. The host immune hyperactivity is also regarded as a pathogenesis of COVID19 23. Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammatory storm is associated with pulmonary
damage in COVID-19 patients 4,8. A profile of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, INF-γ, and
TNF-α, is associated with disease severity and may cause the mortality of COVID-19 patients
4,6,8,16

. Our results showed that thyroid dysfunction was associated with increased inflammation

biomarkers including CRP and leucocytes, indicating inflammatory reaction played an
important role in thyroid impairment. We also found that the decreased lymphocyte level was

associated with hypothyroidism. Since SARS-CoV has been reported to infect immune cells,
mainly T lymphocytes and macrophages 24, we suggest that the extent of decreased lymphocyte
levels may reflect the severity of viral attack and indicate the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
In the present study, we also noticed 7 patients, who had lower than normal levels of TSH
and TT3 on admission, had exhibited a gradual increase of both hormones which normalized
at Day 30 post-admission. Furthermore, the negative feedback of TT3 and TSH level seemed
to be lost at the early stage and returned to work over time, indicating a recovery of the
pituitary-thyroid axis abnormalities as well. A recent case of thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2
infection came up by Brancatella et al. confirmed our finding that the thyroid dysfunction
followed a triphasic course including thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, and euthyroidism 9.
Since no specific and effective pharmaceutical intervention is available at present, the main
treatment of COVID-19 is symptomatic and supportive. The use of glucocorticoids is still
controversial and should be given at right time with appropriate dose and course 7. Besides, the
side effects of glucocorticoids, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and immune suppression,
should be closely monitored

7

. Glucocorticoids can also suppress the function of

adenohypophysis by pituitary-endocrine axis to inhibit the release of TSH. Considering our
results, glucocorticoids should be used carefully in patients exhibiting a trend of
hypothyroidism.
There are several limitations which might cause potential bias. Firstly, the study is
retrospective and single centered, with limited sample size. More patients from multiple centers
should be analyzed in future. Secondly, since little attention has been paid during the treatment
of COVID-19, only 22 patients have complete thyroid function including FT3 and FT4. Lastly,
COVID-19 patients were admitted to hospital at different stages and most of them were not
dynamically monitored in thyroid function.

Conclusions
In the current study, we found that thyroid function abnormalities were common in
COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. The thyroid dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV2 seems to dynamically change within the course of disease and recover gradually. Therefore,
more attention should be paid to thyroid function during treatment of COVID-19, and close
