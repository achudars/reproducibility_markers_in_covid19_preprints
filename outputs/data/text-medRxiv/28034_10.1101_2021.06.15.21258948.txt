Abstract
Background This primary-data analysis investigates the current level of awareness and
medical knowledge of physicians in 20 health facilities in Yerevan, Armenia regarding
vaccination – specifically with regard to HPV infection and the recently-introduced
Gardasil vaccine used against HPV infection – that may have implications for successful
roll-outs of national programmes for new vaccines, including those for COVID-19.
Methods A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was completed by 348 physicians
who met the study inclusion criteria, from 20 out of 36 randomly selected healthcare
facilities in Yerevan, Armenia, between Dec 2017 to Sep 2018. The aim of the
questionnaire was to identify physicians’ awareness of and attitudes to HPV-related
cervical cancer and the Gardasil vaccine. Responses were analysed using SPSS
software (Version 16).
Results The responding physicians displayed a respectable level of knowledge and
awareness regarding vaccination with regard to some characteristics (e.g. more than 81%
knew that HPV infection was commonly asymptomatic, 87% were knew that HPV
infection was implicated in most cervical cancers and 87% knew that cervical cancer is

the most prevalent cancer amongst women) but low knowledge in others and poor
understanding of key issues such as the age at which women were most likely to develop
cervical cancer (only 15% answered correctly); whether or not the vaccine should be
administered to people who had already been affected (27% answered correctly) and
whether sexually active young people should be treated for infection before vaccination
(26%). Lack of confidence within the surveyed groups regarding the value of vaccination
and, in particular concerns over the reasons for administering it to certain age cohorts,
was driven by misconceptions.
Conclusions Armenian physicians’ awareness of vaccine characteristics, the reasons for
their inclusion in the national vaccination programme and the characteristics of the
diseases they treat can be poor. The study further suggests that drivers of vaccine
hesitancy are complex, may not be consistent from vaccine to vaccine, and may vary from
generation to generation. The Armenian healthcare sector may need to provide additional
training, awareness-raising and educational activities to improve understanding of and
trust in vaccination programmes. Further studies are warranted to better understand
knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding immunization and vaccination
programmes amongst Armenian healthcare workers.
Keywords: immunization, vaccine confidence, vaccine hesitancy, HPV, cervical cancer,
Gardasil, COVID-19.
Introduction
Armenia has consistently displayed lower levels of vaccine confidence than surrounding
countries and with Europe as a whole1,2,3 with Armenians showing low levels of trust in
vaccines as safe, effective and/or important.1 This has significant implications for control
and prevention of not only common endemic diseases but of emerging diseases, the
frequency of which is predicted to increase during the 21st century4, risking further
pandemics such as COVID-195. In this paper, we use the national vaccination programme
for human papillomavirus (HPV) in Yerevan, Armenia as a case study for understanding
vaccine hesitancy in Armenia more broadly, for shedding light on some key underlying
reasons for hesitancy – particularly of new vaccines – and for suggesting inventions that

may improve vaccine acceptance as well as confidence and thus enhance the uptake of
vaccines for this and other diseases.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of viruses belonging to the family of
Papillomaviridae that affect epithelial tissue, the layer or layers of cells that form the
covering of most internal and external surfaces of the body and its organs. More than 150
types of HPV have been identified6. In women, HPV infection may cause cervical, vaginal,
vulvar, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers; in males, it may cause anal, penile, and
oropharyngeal cancers.7, 8, 9
Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is one of the leading causes of cancer in women and,
according to 2018 global estimates, results in approximately 570,000 new cases and
311,000 deaths annually10. In the United States, around 4,000 women die from cervical
cancer each year, with African Americans and women from poorer backgrounds having
a much higher rate of mortality11. Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common
cancer among women. The burden faced by low- and middle-income countries is
significantly higher than in high-income regions of the world12. The estimated agestandardised incidence of cervical cancer in 2018 averaged 13.1 per 100 000 women
globally but varied from less than 2 up to 75 per 100,000 women10 depending on the
country.
In Armenia, the cumulative incidence rate of ICC has increased from 9.5 (1985) to 16.6
(2017) per 100,000 women. Annually, about 120-130 women die from cervical cancer in
Armenia (7.4/100,000 in 2016). About 50% of women with ICC are not diagnosed until
the third and fourth stages of the cancer when the treatment outcome is significantly less
certain13, 14.
Currently, there are three HPV vaccines available: bivalent (HPV 16,18), quadrivalent
(HPV 6,11,16,18), and 9-valent (6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58) which can protect against up
to nine of the most prevalent HPV genotypes associated with cancer and genital warts15.
Of these, quadrivalent (HPV 6,11,16,18) is the most common in Armenia. Globally, HPV

vaccines have been extremely successful from both a scientific and clinical viewpoint.
There is strong evidence of population-level impact on the circulation of HPV infection,
incidence of high-grade cervical cancer and cases of genital warts following the
introduction of national vaccination programmes16, 17.
Despite the recommendations for routine HPV vaccinations from the World Health
Organization (WHO), some countries nevertheless still remain hesitant about vaccinating
their young people against HPV18. Armenia is one of these and the vaccine hesitancy
shown with regard to HPV vaccination provides warnings of challenges that may also
hinder other vaccination programmes, including COVID-19. As widespread vaccination is
the most effective way to bring down cases of COVID-19 and to contain the current (and
any potential future) pandemic, understanding the reasons for this vaccine hesitancy is
essential if Armenia (and other countries facing the same phenomenon of vaccine
hesitancy), is to avoid becoming a weak link in regional and global vaccination initiatives
that are needed to bring the pandemic to an end, as well as to better control endemic
diseases.19
Understanding the challenges of introducing a new vaccine to a hesitant population, and
the underlying drivers of and for that hesitancy, is paramount. Armenia is displaying
considerable vaccine hesitancy in response to the development of the COVID-19
vaccines: as of 24th May 2021 only 26,562 vaccines had been administered in Armenia
at a rate of around 0.8% of the population, despite ready availability of the vaccine.
Conducting a study with specific reference to the COVID-19 vaccine would be ideal but,
while this study was undertaken before COVID19 vaccines had been developed, using
HPV vaccine as a proxy is an imperfect but practical alternative to explore how one might
conceptualise vaccine hesitancy in Armenia. HPV thus offers a case study that may
inform the roll-out of other national vaccination programmes.
The quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil was introduced in Armenia in December 201720 but
uptake has been slow, with resistance from the medical community as well as from the
public. To understand possible causes of resistance from medical practitioners, we

conducted a study assessing the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of physicians
regarding HPV and vaccination against HPV, particularly with Gardasil, in Armenia from
Dec 2017 to Sep 2018; the results provide baseline understandings of some causes of
vaccine hesitancy and highlight some issues that may present similar barriers to the
uptake of vaccines developed to combat COVID-19. The survey results reveal, in
addition, that the term ‘vaccine hesitancy’ needs to be unpacked further as there are
degrees or shades of hesitancy that range from near-acceptance to out-right rejection.
Methods
Between December 2017 and September 2018, a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional,
quantitative study was conducted in Armenian healthcare facilities to identify respondents’
awareness of and attitudes to HPV-related cervical cancer and the Gardasil vaccine. The
questionnaire was adapted from a survey previously used to determine the knowledge
and attitude of registered nurses towards HPV and HPV vaccine in the USA21. This was
considered to be suitably generic that it did not require amendment to the local context.
The questionnaire was administered to physicians at 20 out of 36 government-run
healthcare facilities in Yerevan; the facilities included were selected at random from all
those available.
The inclusion criteria for the study respondents were fully qualified medical staff from four
medical specialities considered most likely to have direct interaction with HPV-infected
patients or with patients eligible for HPV vaccination: paediatricians, family-practice
doctors, gynaecologists and oncologists. Exclusion criteria was student doctors, nurses,
residents and doctors from other specialities. This yielded a possible survey size of 405
physicians in the 20 facilities. Trained researchers from Yerevan State University School
of Public Health visited each of the healthcare facilities included and personally invited
physicians to participate in the study. Of the 405 eligible staff at the 20 facilities, 385 (95%)
were approached to participate (the remaining 20 were not available on any of the days
the researchers visited) of whom 348 (90.3%) gave consent and completed the survey.
The survey was conducted by face-to-face interview in each physician’s usual place of
work. The required sample size was calculated using the Estimate-proportion n=z2*pq/d2

formula.22 Of a total population of 405 eligible participants, 348 (90.3%) returned surveys
with consent given and all sections completed. This is well above the number required to
be considered a representative sample (Figure 1).
Data including the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents (gender, age
and length of service within the healthcare profession) were collected. The questionnaire
also addressed respondents’ existing knowledge and attitudes across four areas: 1)
Knowledge/Information about HPV; 2) Knowledge/Information about the HPV vaccine; 3)
Attitude towards the HPV vaccine; and 4) Attitude towards other vaccines. Respondents
could answer the survey questions ‘True’, ‘False’ or ‘I don’t know’, numerically coded 1,
2, and 88, respectively.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yerevan State Medical University
after Mkhitar Heratsi (YSMU 14.06.2016/No 10).
Statistical analysis
Chi-square analyses were used for the categorical variables which compared the age
groups of respondents, their lengths of experience as doctors, and the fields they
specialised in. For all analyses conducted in the study, an association of p<0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS software
(Version 16.0).
A hierarchy heatmap on physicians’ opinions of the HPV vaccine was constructed using

based on the percentage of respondents who answered ‘yes’ to a series of questions.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which factors effect
awareness of HPV and its vaccine amongst physicians in Armenia. Using the glm function
in R, nine logistic regression models were constructed to determine the odds ratio (OD)

and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for physicians answering at random: 1) HPV is
relatively uncommon 2) Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV 3) HPV is most
common in women in their 30s 4) Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers
among women 5) Most people with genital HPV are symptomatic 6) Genital warts are
caused by the same HPV types that cause cervical cancer 7) Sexually active adolescents
should be tested before HPV vaccination 8) HPV vaccine is available for both males and
females and 9) Men and women who have been diagnosed with HPV should not be given
HPV vaccine. Factors that were considered in the model were physicians’ speciality, age
and experience.
Limitations
Our study is represented by health facilities (and physicians) from Yerevan only, therefore
the findings may not be generalizable to the whole of Armenia. Knowledge and attitude
of respondents working in medical facilities located out of Yerevan may vary from study
results. The assumptions we made about the generalisability of these findings to vaccine
confidence in general and confidence to COVID-19 vaccines in particular are
assumptions only and need to be tested in further research studies.

Results
A total of 348 (90.3%) participants from the 20 randomly selected health facilities (from
total of 36 health facilities located in Yerevan) completed the survey and were included in
the final analysis (Figure 1).
The respondents were predominantly female (95%), reflecting the demographics of the
professions (paediatricians, family-practice physicians, gynaecologists, and oncologists).
The gender inequality among the respondents (95% female) is not a limitation of this
study: according to recent statistics, in Armenia female doctors are more likely to
specialise in paediatrics, family-practice and gynaecology, hence the high levels of
female respondents in this study. A report published by the Ministry of Health, Armenia in
2016 shows that 40-60% of physicians were female and of these 91.8% were

paediatricians, family-practice physicians and general practitioners, of which 95.2% were
paediatricians23. As previous studies of vaccine hesitancy either recorded no significant
differences between men and women24 or have been inconsistent over which gender is
more likely to be vaccine hesitant25,26, a heavily female survey cohort is unlikely to
influence perceptions of vaccine hesitancy overall. Of those participating in this study,
62% were paediatricians, 16% family-practice physicians, 13% gynaecologists, and 9%
were oncologists. The age distribution was 29-60+years of age, with 52% between 45
and 59 years old. Two-thirds (67%) had more than 20 years of experience as doctors.
Knowledge of HPV transmission, symptoms and disease
In response to some questions, study participants displayed strong awareness of the
issues surrounding HPV infection and its related health outcomes, for instance most knew
that cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among women (87.2%)
and nearly three-quarters (73.4%) knew that most cervical cancers are caused by the
HPV virus (73.4%). (Table 1). Awareness of presentation of the disease was also high,
with 81% aware that most people with genital HPV infections are unlikely to display
symptoms of the disease.
However, 44.4% of the participants were unaware that HPV is a relatively common
sexually transmitted infection and 29% of respondents unaware that the vaccine is
available to both females and males. More than half (53.5%) answered that the same
types of HPV that cause genital warts also cause cervical cancer, which is incorrect. Only
27% of the respondents were aware that both male and female patients diagnosed with
HPV should still be encouraged to receive the vaccine, and only a similar proportion (26%)
knew that sexually-active adolescents do not need to be tested before receiving their HPV
vaccinations.
Fewer than two thirds (61%) of physicians knew that the HPV vaccine consists of
recombinant HPV protein.
Knowledge compared by medical specialism

The proportion of correct answers varied among the physicians according to their
speciality, although the differences were not statistically significant overall (p>0.05).
Overall, a higher number of correct answers came from paediatricians (65%) than from
other groups.
Gynaecologists were more likely than other specialities to answer correctly that HPV is
most common in women in their 30s (OD 0.12, p=0.000824), although as only 40.9% of
gynaecologists

specialties.

Gyanecologists were, however, more likely to answer incorrectly that genital warts are
caused by the same strains of HPV, with 65.9% giving an incorrect answer compared
with 24.6% of paediatricians (OD 2.17 p=0.0246) (Table 1). This suggests that physicians’
level of knowledge is inconsistent across specialties.
For the other questions, differences between specialties were not statistically significant,
though paediatricians (74.8%) and oncologists (74.2%) returned a higher rate of correct
responses than family practitioners (70.9%) and gynaecologists (68.2%) for the question,
“All common cervical cancers are caused by HPV” (p=0.03). There was no significant
difference between the specialties in their understanding of whether people with HPV are
likely to be symptomatic (they were equally incorrect) (p=0.187); that cervical cancer is
one of the most common cancers amongst women, which most answered correctly
(p=0.08); and whether or not HPV is a relatively common infection (p=0.643), which just
over half of family physicians, oncologists and paediatricians believed to be true, and just
under half of the gynaecologists (46.5%).
Knowledge compared by age and length of professional service
The proportion of correct answers was significantly different across the age groups
(p=0.004). Respondents in the age group 45-59 years old returned a higher rate of correct
answers overall. Physicians in the age group under 44 years old were more likely (69.1%)
to give a correct answer for the question regarding how common HPV is (Table 1)

compared with physicians in age groups 45-59 and over 60s (OD 2.56 and 5.26, p-value
0.023637 and 0.000724 respectfully) (Table 3). The 45-59 age group were also more
likely to answer correctly that almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infection
(77.8%) than those in the lower age group (68.3%, p = 0.018) and the over 60s.
The proportion of correct answers was significantly different when compared across the
number of years of service. Respondents with 15–19 years of service answered questions
correctly more often (50%) than those who had been in the profession for both a longer
(30%) and a shorter time (44.6%) (p=0.003). This differences may be linked to mid-career
physicians being more likely to still attend courses, and to engage in more educational
activities than those nearing the end of their careers, providing greater opportunities for
keeping up-to-date with new developments.
Attitudes towards HPV vaccination
The survey contained six questions that measured confidence or hesitancy to vaccines
in general and the HPV vaccine in particular. The majority of the respondents (87.7%)
supported the national vaccination programme for general childhood vaccination but
fewer than two-thirds (63.8%) agreed that the introduction of the HPV vaccine into the
national vaccination programme was appropriate. More than half (53.3%) expressed
concern over the efficacy the HPV vaccine, 61.0% expressed concerns over its safety,
and 58.50% agreed with the statement that the vaccine is “too new and hasn’t been
around long enough”. Just under half (42.9%) agreed with the statement that 13 is too
young for a child to receive the vaccine (Figure 2).
Support for vaccination by specialty
Different specialties displayed statistically significant (p=0.000) attitudes to the
introduction of the HPV vaccine into the national vaccination programme: a higher
proportion of paediatricians (75.2%) agreed with it, which was statistically higher than the
other groups (oncologists 57%; family physicians 47% and gynaecologists 36%).
Paediatricians were more likely to agree with the need for the HPV vaccination

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.21258948; this version posted June 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

programme (75.2%) than other specialists, which is consistent with a study from Serbia
in which nearly two-thirds of the paediatricians were willing to recommend the vaccine
(60.2%).27
The proportion of physicians concerned about side effects of the vaccine (including the
risk of infertility, for which there is no medical evidence) also differed significantly among
different specialties (p=0.000), with a higher percentage of family physicians and
gynaecologists showing concern (respectively 76.4% and 79.5%) than paediatricians and
oncologists (52% and 67%). Physicians over 60 years old showed a statistically
significantly different level of concern about efficiency and the side effects than those
under 60 (respectively p=0.003, p=0.002) (Tables 1 and 2).
There was no statistically significant difference in the specialty of physicians who were
concerned about the newness of the vaccine (p=0.01) but there was with regard to the
age at which it should be given (p=0.000 respectively). The highest percentage of
physicians who were concerned that the vaccine was too new (74.5%) and that a 13year-old was too young to receive the vaccine (54.5%) was family physicians, suggesting
that this speciality is more prone to vaccine hesitancy than others, the reasons for which
require further investigation.
Respondents who were concerned about efficacy were more likely to hold the opinion
that the HPV vaccine is too new and “has not been around long enough” (58.8%) (Figure
2).
The proportion of physicians over the age of 60 who were concerned that 13-year-old
females were too young for the vaccination was higher (55.4%) than in younger
physicians (39.2%), suggesting that attitudes can differ between demographic groups.
The differences in answers to this question among the different age groups was
statistically significant (p=0.003).

In a final question, respondents reported that they had gained information about HPV
vaccine from conferences and special events organized by the Ministry of Health,
Armenia (72%), specialist literature (63%), colleagues (58%), and self-guided internet
searches (57%).
Discussion
Our study shows that there are knowledge gaps in Armenian physicians’ understanding
with regards to some basic aspects of HPV infection and the HPV vaccines that is likely
to influence not only the administration of HPV vaccines but also other national
vaccination programmes and rollouts, including that for COVID-19, since some of the
underlying concerns are likely to be generalizable. These knowledge gaps affect
physicians’ understanding of disease transmission; symptoms and presentation; who will
benefit from the vaccine; and vaccine safety and efficacy.
The level understanding amongst Armenian physicians with regard to the mechanisms of
disease and vaccination efficacy and benefits is poor. The majority of the physicians knew
that cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among women and that
it is caused by the HPV virus but only half of the participants knew that genital warts and
cervical cancer are caused by different strains of HPV and a third were unaware that the
HPV vaccine is available for both females and males. This suggests that better
information about vaccine-controllable diseases and their aetiology may need to be
provided as part of vaccination roll-out programmes to ensure that physicians are wellinformed, and their information is up to date. There may be value in more systematically
embedding awareness training as part of continuing professional development
programmes for healthcare workers who are likely to be in roles that can influence vaccine
take-up or hesitancy.
Almost all respondents were aware of the HPV vaccine. Paediatricians were significantly
more knowledgeable than other speciality groups, possibly because they were the group
most likely to be dealing with the age group that is recommended for vaccination.
However, the results show that knowing a vaccine is available does not always

correspond to being well informed about it or the disease it can prevent. 62% of physicians
were concerned about side effects of the HPV vaccine (although they were not able to
specify what any such side effects might be when asked) suggesting that honest
discussions around any likely side effects, including their frequency, treatment and patient
outcomes may help to build healthcare practitioner confidence. In addition, 54% of the
physicians were worried about the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, which again could
be addressed by in-job training and awareness that would help them to impart greater
confidence to patients, who are likely to look to healthcare professionals to advise them.
The particularly low number of correct answers given by the longer-serving group (Table
1) suggests that continued professional training after qualification, to keep one’s skills upto-date, may be somewhat lacking; although the least experienced group also scored
lower than the group with mid-level experience and further study is required to understand
the reasons for this.
These knowledge gaps exist despite the fact that almost all respondents reported
participating in special events, such as training and seminars, and mentioned specialized
literature as one of their main sources of information, suggesting that the current training
and methods of information dissemination are ineffective. Further studies are warranted
to understand the reasons behind these statistics, particularly as physicians can act as
powerful gatekeepers whose attitudes may have ramifications for vaccine hesitancy and
acceptance within the communities of patients they attend.
Cultural assumptions and misconceptions
It is noted that cultural assumptions can deflect from the scientific basis of vaccine
schedules. In Armenia, the routine early childhood immunisation coverage is estimated
at 93%-97% of all children and physicians strongly support vaccination programmes
amongst this age group.28 This study suggests that whilst early childhood vaccinations
are strongly supported by most Armenian physicians (87.70%), fewer are comfortable
with the inclusion of the HPV vaccine into the national vaccination programme (63.80%).

activity and felt that support for the vaccination of young girls was a tacit acceptance of
early sexual activity. This attitude was more frequently found among physicians over 60
years old, suggesting that vaccine hesitancy may be more complex than a binary ‘yes/no’:
a ‘no’ for one age cohort may become a ‘yes’ for another. However, the age of vaccine
administration is not, in fact, determined by the age at which sexual activity is likely to
begin: according to the WHO, the recommended priority age for HPV vaccination is 9-13
years old because this is the age at which the immune system response is highest and
produces the necessary level of antibodies and immune-system memory to protect
against HPV infection for life, not because this is the age at which children may become
sexually active. It is important for preteens to get all three doses long before any sexual
activity begins.29 This should not affect the administration of vaccines for COVID-19 but
does show how cultural attitudes and beliefs intersect with scientific evidence to build
acceptance or resistance to vaccination. Vaccine confidence or hesitancy can be based
on sociocultural factors as well as medical science.
Controversies among health professionals relating to the inclusion of HPV in national
immunization schedules has also been described in Spain, where 89% of health
professionals were aware of the relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer
but 65.7% resist its introduction into vaccine schedules, arguing that there is no data on
its long-term effectiveness.25
The Armenian physicians also expressed concern over the newness of the Gardasil
vaccine (from 36.7% amongst oncologists to 74.5% in family physicians; 58.5% across
all specialities). This is particularly concerning with regard to COVID-19, as all the
vaccines for this disease (and likely for future emerging diseases) are new and have
been developed more quickly than is usual for new pharmaceuticals. This may require
targeted education to help healthcare providers understand the development and
approvals process for these new vaccines to give assurance that it is the paperwork,
funding mechanisms, and administration around the clinical trials and approvals that has
been speeded up, not the safety aspects of trials24. This in turn this could be used to
reassure patients that new vaccines are ‘safe’.

By paying more attention to the disconnect between the scientific basis for the decision
to vaccinate and the cultural assumptions against vaccination at this particular age, we
may be able start to explore how such attitudes can be changed. It also illustrates that by
not being aware of such assumptions and failing to take time to address them in
awareness information and training given to professionals responsible for administering
the vaccine, vaccine confidence can be undermined by misconceptions and cultural
perceptions that may prove harder to dispel later on.
Vaccine hesitancy may not be universal
The different levels of confidence in the national childhood vaccination programme
compared with the introduction of the HPV vaccination highlight that different vaccines
can be considered independently of one another. Vaccine hesitancy may not be universal
to all vaccines nor have the same underlying concerns with regard to each vaccine.
Understanding this more fully would benefit from further research to help determine how
different forms of hesitancy can be effectively challenged and what steps might be taken
in advance to stop such hesitancy from becoming widespread within certain communities.
Further studies could also usefully determine the extent to which physicians’ poor
understanding, misconceptions and hesitancy may influence their decision to administer
vaccines and their ability to sufficiently inform patients of vaccine benefits.
Conclusion
This study shows that the concerns and worries that influence negative attitudes towards
vaccines, and which may prevent physicians from recommending vaccination, are
complex. Reasons may differ for different diseases and may be influenced by different
underlying factors, all of which suggest the need for stronger vaccine-confidence
awareness training that helps physicians – and by extension, to the patients they advise
– to navigate these concerns by providing up-to-date and comprehensive information that

will enhance confidence and dispel unwarranted concerns. The role of the media, and its
portrayal of HPV vaccination is likely to have some influence in this process and should
be considered within future research programmes.
Differences in the approach of different physicians in Armenia to HPV vaccination was
evident in this study, with different approaches noted based on their age, length of service,
specialty and cultural assumptions. Overall, however, the study merely highlights gaps
our complete understanding of vaccine hesitancy and how this may vary between
different vaccines and for the prevention of different diseases; it does not address them.
In this regard, priority consideration should be given to further study and, in the short term,
to developing a programme of continuous education on all aspects of vaccination
development, safety, efficacy and societal value, both for HPV infections and for other
newly developed or introduced vaccines. Further research is needed to fully investigate
all underlying reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and to develop interventions to address this
and improve confidence.
