Abstract
Rationale: The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has not
been established.
Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those
without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population.
Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD
admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and
compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with
COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis
distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of
death.
Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were
included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of
COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in
patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher
mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and comorbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80%
had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC ≥80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83).
Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13−3.46).
Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly
those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid
COVID-19 in patients with ILD.

Introduction
Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) represent a group of fibroinflammatory diseases affecting
the alveolar interstitium of the lung. ILDs are characterised by alveolar damage and
interstitial thickening and, if left untreated, lead to remorseless progression of
breathlessness, cough and ultimately death from respiratory failure. The prevalence of ILDs
in Europe is just under one per 1,000 people, with an annual incidence of approximately 20
per 100,000 people (1). The commonest ILD is sarcoidosis, but one of the most severe ILD is
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a high incidence of which is found in the UK (12 per
100,000) (2, 3). IPF tends to affect older people with a mean age at diagnosis of 72 years.
Men are more often affected than women. Furthermore, IPF is associated with diabetes
mellitus type 2 (DMT2), hypertension (HT) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (4, 5). People
suffering from other ILDs (non-IPF ILD) tend to be younger, with a higher proportion of
female sufferers, and often receive immunosuppressive therapy.
All ILDs, most notably IPF, are characterised by acute exacerbations which have a
particularly high mortality rate ranging from 35-70% (6). The precise cause of acute
exacerbations is unknown, but they have been associated with thoracic surgical procedures
and viral infections (6). Furthermore, an acute exacerbation is associated with the
development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which carries a high mortality
and morbidity. However, there is no consensus on treatment of ARDS in this group of
patients, given that mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive therapy in nonILD patients (7).
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to COVID-19, characterised by a severe viral pneumonia
and ARDS in approximately 20% of patients admitted to hospital (8). Patients most at risk of
severe COVID-19 include elderly males with comorbidities including DMT2, HT and IHD

(9,10) which are shared by patients with ILD, most notably IPF (5). Despite the potential
increased risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with ILD have not been uniformly advised
to isolate themselves from the rest of the population to avoid infection at the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
To understand whether individuals with ILD are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 and
should therefore be advised to self-isolate during the pandemic, we undertook an
international multicentre analysis of patients admitted to hospital between the 1 March and
1 May 2020 with COVID-19. We compared outcomes of patients with ILD with age, sex and
comorbidity matched controls admitted with COVID-19 but without ILD, from a prospective
UK cohort, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium
Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Protocol (ISARIC4C CCP-UK).

Methods
Patients
ILD centres throughout Europe were asked to identify all patients with a pre-existing
diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital between 1st March and 1st May 2020 during the first
peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. De-identified, unlinked data from individuals were
included in an audit to assess the consequence of national shielding policies. Each
contributing site was asked to identify individuals admitted to their local hospital. Local
hospitals were asked to include whether or not a patient was diagnosed with COVID-19
based on a SARS-CoV-2 positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab and or clinicoradiological diagnosis for patient flow (Figure 1). Audit data was appended to the ISARIC4C
CCP-UK database, with separate categorisation of individuals who reported an existing
chronic pulmonary disease. Significant comorbidities of diabetes (type 1 or type 2),
hypertension, chronic heart disease and malignancy, as well as immunomodulatory
therapies, were recorded in both ILD audit data and the ISARIC database. Outcomes
recorded in both datasets for each patient included ventilated status, use of continuous
positive airway pressure, use of high flow oxygen and whether discharged, remained
hospitalised, or died. Length of stay was censored at 1st May 2020.

Ethics and Consent
All data were entered by the Local Clinical Care Team in anonymised fashion without linkage
to any patient identifiers in line with national and local audit guidance. In the UK Health
Research Authority guidance was followed (https://www.hra.nhs.uk/covid-19research/guidance-using-patient-data/), and ethical approval was not required. ISARIC4C
CCP-UK received ethical approval from the South Central - Oxford C Research Ethics

Committee in England (Ref: 13/SC/0149), and by the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee
(Ref: 20/SS/0028). Data from Spain was collected under the approval for observational
studies (Ref UIC-IBU-2020-03 and PR217/20). Data from Germany were collected under
approval from ethics committee of the Medical faculty of the University of Heidelberg (ref S186/2020).

Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics are presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical data and
mean (standard deviation (sd)) for normally distributed continuous data. Where continuous
data were not normally distributed, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) was used.
Differences in categorical data were compared using the Chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact
test when expected counts were below 5 in any group. For continuous normally distributed
2-group data, we compared differences using Welch’s T-test or Mann Whitney-U if data
were not normally distributed. For multiple group comparisons of continuous data, we used
Kruskall-Wallis tests. Data from the ILD dataset were matched in a 1:2 ratio with patients
who did not have ILD from the ISARIC4C CCP-UK dataset using a nearest neighbour
propensity-score matching algorithm. Patients in ISARIC4C CCP-UK with ILD were excluded
to avoid double counting. We matched on confounders known to affect outcomes from
COVID-19 disease including age, sex, diabetes, chronic cardiac disease, cancer,
hypertension, and renal disease. Unmatched and matched populations were compared
using standardized mean differences, plots and summary statistics. For survival analyses,
time was taken as admission to death (in-hospital survival) using length of stay where date
was not available. Discharge from hospital was considered an absorbing state (once
discharged, patients were considered no longer at risk of death). Discharged patients were

not censored and included in the risk set until the end of follow-up, thus discharge did not
compete with death. We generated subclasses based on the propensity-score distance and
included these as terms within Cox proportional hazards models, where estimates are
presented as hazards ratios, alongside the corresponding 95% confidence interval (11). Data
were analysed using R version 3.6.3 with tidyverse, matchit and finalfit packages.

Results
Baseline Demographics
Between March 1st and May 1st 2020, 349 patients with ILD were admitted to 37 hospitals
throughout the UK and Europe. A total of 185 ILD patients had a diagnosis of COVID-19 and
161 were suitable for propensity-score matching (Figure 1). Of these, 110 (68%) were male
and the mean age was 73.2 (±11.5) years. The most common ILD was IPF, with 68 (42%)
patients admitted to hospital (Table 1). During the same time period, 164 patients with ILD
were admitted with an alternative non-COVID diagnosis, of whom 69 (42.1%) had IPF.
Overall the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for patients with ILD and COVID-19 was 49% (79/161)
compared with 17% (28/164) for patients with ILD admitted for other reasons.

Effect of ILD on outcome from COVID-19
After propensity-score matching, 161 patients with ILD were compared with 322 patients
admitted to hospital between the 1st March and 1st May 2020 but without ILD, or other
chronic lung disease (Table 1). There was significantly higher mortality in patients with ILD
compared with non ILD patients (49% (79/161) vs 35% (114/322) p=0.013) and was
associated with an increased risk of death in adjusted analysis (HR 1.60 CI 1.17-2.18
p=0.003). There was significantly higher mortality in patients with ILD compared with non
ILD patients (figure 2), which was greatest in men and increased with age, which persisted
for men after adjusting for age and comorbidity (adjusted HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.43, p =
0.015). The risk of mortality was greatest in patients with IPF (HR 1.74, 95%CI 1.16 to 2.60
p=0.007), but a higher mortality was also seen in non-IPF ILD (HR 1.50, 95%CI 1.02 to 2.21
p=0.040; Figure 3a) when compared with matched patients without ILD. Of patients with
non-IPF ILD, those with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and rheumatoid ILD had the

highest mortality (50% (7/14) and 40% (4/10) respectively), whilst those with sarcoidosis
and connective tissue disease (excluding rheumatoid) related ILD had the lowest observed
mortality (33% (3/9) and 23% (3/13) respectively). Overall, median length of stay in those
who were still alive was not substantially different between patients without ILD (9 days
[IQR 11])), compared with non-IPF ILD (10 days [IQR 8])) and IPF (10 days [IQR 8]) (p = 0.725)
(Table 2).

Predictors of outcome from COVID-19
Obesity has been previously described to increase the risk of death from COVID-19. After
obesity was included in the propensity score matching (129/161 ILD patients with data
available, matched to 260 non-ILD patients), being obese and having ILD was significantly
associated with an increased hazard of death from COVID-19 (adjusted HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.13
to 3.46, p = 0.016; figure 3b), which was greater than the effect of obesity in non-ILD
patients.
To determine whether patients with more severe ILD had a greater risk of mortality with
COVID-19, the last available lung function results prior to hospital admission were analysed.
For all ILD patients, the mean Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) in patients surviving COVID-19 was
82.2% predicted compared with 76.8% predicted in patients who died (p=0.121). Similarly,
the mean Diffusion coefficient of Carbon Monoxide (DLco) was 56.4% predicted in survivors
compared with 49.6% in patients dying with COVID (p=0.072; Table 3). When the FVC was
dichotomized using the 80% predicted threshold between mild and moderate ILD, in line
with UK prescribing policy for anti-fibrotic medication, the risk of mortality was significantly
higher in patients with moderate or severe ILD (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.83), compared with
mild disease (Figure 3c).

Ventilatory support for ILD patients with COVID-19
Most patients with ILD (84%; 135/161) did not receive enhanced respiratory support which
was similar to matched patients without ILD (79%; 254/322; Table 2). Significantly more
patients who survived did not receive enhanced respiratory support (93%, 76/82) compared
with those who died (75%; 59/79 p=0.015). Of the 26 patients receiving enhanced
respiratory support 77% (20) died, including 83% (5/6) of matched patients with ILD
receiving ventilation (Table 4).

Effect of anti-fibrotic and immunosuppressive therapy on outcome from COVID-19.
In patients with ILDs 106 were taking no immunosuppressants or anti-fibrotic of whom 50%
died (53/106; Table 5). Almost a third of patients with IPF (20/68) were receiving antifibrotic therapy at the time of admission. Seven patients were receiving pirfenidone and 13
were receiving nintedanib. Of those receiving anti-fibrotic therapy, 50% (10/20) died.
Where immunosuppressants were reported, corticosteroids were most frequently
prescribed (45/55) followed by mycophenolate (17/55); overall 47% (26/55) of patients
taking anti-fibrotics or immunosuppressants died. Significantly more patients with ILD
received oral corticosteroids in hospital than patients without ILD (27.8% versus 9.9%;
p<0.001) but there was no difference in outcome between those receiving corticosteroids
(48.9% mortality (22/55)) and those who did not (48.7% mortality (57/117)).

Discussion
Determining the risk of poor outcome in patients pre-existing conditions who acquire SARSCoV-2 infection is crucial to determine what mitigation measures are required in the
community. Our study shows that patients with existing interstitial lung disease were at very
high risk of death when hospitalised with COVID-19, especially if they have reduced prior
lung function or obesity. Most died without being offered mechanical ventilation; in those
who were ventilated, mortality was very high.

Known risk factors for poor outcomes in COVID-19 include increasing age, male sex, DM, HT,
IHD and COPD (9,12). Unfortunately, the risk for patients with ILD has not yet been
quantified because patients with uncommon diseases often do not have their specific
diagnostic information recorded in large observational studies or are often not accurately
reported in administrative healthcare datasets. Despite the unknown risk of COVID-19 for
patients with ILD, many patients chose to self-isolate and, therefore, there appeared to be
apparent ‘protection’ from COVID-19 observed to many ILD physicians around the world. To
accurately understand the risk of COVID-19 and inform decision- and risk-matrices going
forward, the European ILD community undertook an audit of hospitalised patients with ILD
between the 1st March and 1st May 2020 to coincide with the first peak of COVID-19 within
Europe. These data represent the largest assessment of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection
on patients with ILD to date. They demonstrate that patients with ILD are at increased risk
of death following hospitalisation for COVID-19 particularly elderly males, with poor lung
and obesity.

The role of viral infection promoting acute exacerbations of ILD has been investigated for a
number of years without a definitive answer, which probably reflects the range of viruses
studied, the number of patients needed to explore such a hypothesis, and more broadly the
challenges studying acute exacerbations of ILD (13,14,15,16). These data confirm that
patients with ILD are at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared with a matched
population without ILD and the risk is greatest for IPF consistent with a respiratory virus
inducing acute exacerbations of ILD.

Factors associated with poor prognosis in acute exacerbations of ILD include pulmonary
fibrosis and poor lung function prior to admission and fibrotic ILDs (17,18,19,20). The data
presented here, support these prior studies demonstrating that patients with a recorded
FVC <80% predicted prior to admission had an increased mortality compared with those
with an FVC >80%. Similarly, patients with fibrotic ILDs such as Chronic Hypersensitivity
Pneumonitis had mortality rates comparable with IPF and higher than those with Sarcoid or
Connective Tissue Disease associated ILD. Interestingly, obese patients with ILD had a
substantially increased risk of mortality. This may reflect use of steroids in severe disease,
although we do not favour this hypothesis as there was no apparent increased risk of death
associated with corticosteroid use. Obesity may be due to limited activity in ILD patients, a
condition that leads to progressive reduction in exercise tolerance as it becomes more
severe (21). Alternatively, and perhaps most intriguingly, it may lend support to the
hypothesis that severe ILD is part of the ‘metabolic syndrome’ (22).

This analysis also assessed respiratory support offered to patients hospitalised with ILD. In
line with current practice and guidelines most patients did not receive any ventilatory

support (7, 23). Most patients who survived did not require enhanced respiratory support
such as High Flow Oxygen, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or ventilation, and of those
receiving enhanced respiratory support the majority died. These data continue to support
the use of supportive care in preference to either non-invasive or invasive mechanical
ventilation except in clearly defined cases such as predominantly inflammatory ILD or
bridging to transplantation.

This analysis has a number of strengths. It is the largest, international, multicentre study to
assess the outcome of patients with Interstitial Lung Disease hospitalised with the
respiratory infection SARS-Cov-2. Merging of the ILD Audit dataset with the ISARIC4C CCPUK dataset enabled accurate, contemporary propensity-score matching for a number of
potential confounding factors to assess the risk from COVID-19 disease. This enabled an
assessment of the risk to patients with ILD infected with SARS-CoV-2, facilitating evidencebased mitigation strategies, such as self-isolation for this vulnerable group of patients.
This study also has some potential weaknesses. Due to the retrospective nature of the data
collection recall bias might have led to over-selection of severe cases of COVID-19 in
patients with ILD, however, this is mitigated by the large number of centres participating in
the audit. Similarly, because only hospitalised patients could be included, it is possible that a
large number of patients with ILD and COVID-19 were omitted and, therefore, the risk of
COVID-19 could be over-stated. However, given the demographic associated with ILD we
think this is unlikely. Also, the propensity-score matching included some younger patients
who would be expected to have less severe disease, although there was insufficient detail in
the audit data collection to match for COVID-19 severity based on admission severity scores.
The effect of obesity was assessed in the matched population suggesting an increased risk in

patients without ILD, however in contrast with prior reports (9,24 ) no effect of obesity was
observed in the control population. This probably reflects the relatively small numbers of
patients used in the matching and the large amount of missing data relating to weight.
Therefore, the data relating to obesity must be interpreted accordingly, but we believe as a
modifiable risk factor it is important to highlight the risk of obesity in patients with ILD who
might develop COVID-19. Finally, it was not possible to evaluate specific treatment effects,
such as the use of anti-fibrotics and immunosuppressants. Only a proportion of patients
received anti-fibrotics during their admission. Furthermore, due to the unknown effect of
anti-fibrotics, and concerns regarding immunosuppression on the clinical course of COVID19 there is likely to be considerable confounding due to indication. There are both potential
benefits (25,26) and harms associated with background therapy for ILD (27). However, it is
reassuring from a safety perspective that there was no obvious signal suggesting harms
associated with therapy for ILD in patients with COVID-19, although, further study to
evaluate the consequence of anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory therapy in ILD are
needed.

In summary, these data demonstrate that patients with ILD, particularly those with fibrotic
ILD are at higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 than patients without ILD. Furthermore,
the risk is heightened in elderly males, those with obesity or poor lung function and we
would recommend dietary advice in overweight patients. Ventilatory support did not
objectively improve outcomes for COVID-19 and we therefore suggest that ventilatory
support only be offered in select subgroups of patients in line with current
recommendations. Similarly, anti-fibrotic, or immunosuppressive medication did not
objectively alter outcome and therefore we do not propose these medications should be

withheld during future COVID-19 surges. We also propose that patients with ILD, particularly
severe fibrotic ILD, continue to be regarded as high risk of mortality from COVID-19 and
follow national self-isolation guidelines for vulnerable individuals and be prioritised for
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at such time as it becomes available. Finally, we believe these data
demonstrate the importance of international collaboration to collect data to understand the
consequences of emerging threats to patients with ILD.
