ABSTRACT
Objective
Describe the clinical and respiratory characteristics of critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19).
Design
Observational and retrospective study over 6 months.
Setting
Intensive care unit (ICU) of a high complexity hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Patients
Patients
older
than
18
years
with
laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study.
Variables of interest
Demographic characteristics such as sex and age, comorbidities, laboratory results, imaging results,
ventilatory mechanics data, complications, and mortality were recorded.
Results
A total of 168 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. 66% were men with a median age of
65 years (58-75. 79.7% had at least one comorbidity. The most frequent comorbidity was arterial
hypertension, affecting 52.4% of the patients. 67.9 % required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV),
and no patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation. Most of the patients in MV (73.7%) required
neuromuscular blockade due to severe hypoxemia. 36% of patients were ventilated in the prone
position. The length of stay in the ICU was 13 days (6-24) and the mortality in the ICU was 25%.
Conclusions
In this study of critical patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in a high-complexity hospital, the majority
were comorbid elderly men, a large percentage required invasive mechanical ventilation, and ICU
mortality was 25%.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention. On March 11th of 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak as a
pandemic due to the constantly increasing number of cases outside China​1​. Up to date,
SARS-CoV-2 affected more than 32 million people over the world and caused 1 million
deaths.
On March 3rd of 2020, 64 days after the first case was reported in China, a case in
Argentina was confirmed. Since then the number of cases gently ascended​2​; up to
September 30th of 2020, a total of 736.609 had tested positive for the new SARS-CoV-2,
with 139.419 active cases and 3.792 (2.7%) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU)​3​.
Nevertheless, local information about the incidence and clinical characteristics of critically ill
patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is still limited​4​. In this context, knowledge of the baseline
characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients is crucial for health and government
officials engaged in planning efforts to address local outbreaks. This case series describes
clinical characteristics, image findings and respiratory mechanics of COVID-19 patients
admitted to ICU in a High Complexity Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires.
METHOD
Study design and participants
For this retrospective single-center study, ICU patients were recruited between March 15th
of 2020 and September 15th of 2020. Data were obtained from medical records of adult
patients (18 years of age or older) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in the
ICU in a High Complexity Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires. Patients with adequacy of
therapeutic effort at ICU admission were excluded.
According to WHO guidance​5​, laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a
positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
of nasopharyngeal swabs. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis
and the study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee in March 2019.
Procedure
Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, respiratory support, and outcome data
were obtained. Radiologic assessment of chest x-rays and all laboratory testing was
performed according to treating physician criteria. The presence of a radiologic abnormality
was determined and the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score​6 was
calculated and reviewed by medical imaging specialists. Laboratory assessment consisted of
a complete blood count, a blood chemical analysis, coagulation testing, assessment of liver
and renal function, and measure of electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, pro
b-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin
(hs-cTnT), d-dimer, ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6).

The number of patients who had died or had been discharged, and those that stayed in the
ICU until September 30th of 2020 was recorded. Additionally, ICU length of stay was
determined.
Statistical analysis
No statistical sample size calculation was performed in advance and the sample size was
equal to the number of patients treated during the study period. Continuous variables were
expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical
variables were summarized as counts and percentages.
No imputation was made for missing data. Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to
compare nonparametric continuous variables. χ2 or Fisher exact test was used for
categorical variables as appropriate. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and statistical
significance was defined as P < .05. The analysis has not been adjusted for multiple
comparisons, and given the possibility of a type I error, the findings should be interpreted as
exploratory and descriptive. All the analyses were performed with the use of R Software,
version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Between March 15th of 2020 and September 15th of 2020, a total of 259 patients with
suspected COVID-19 were referred to the ICU in a high complexity hospital in the city of
Buenos Aires. A total of 87 patients with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 were not
included in the study. Additionally, 4 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 but
adequacy of therapeutic effort at ICU admission were excluded too. Thus, data from 168
critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was analyzed.
Overall, 66% (111) patients were male with a median age of 67(58-75) years old. Eighty
percent (134) of patients presented at least one comorbidity. Hypertension was the most
common comorbidity, affecting 52,4% (88) of patients, followed by obesity in 41,6% (70)
patients. 6.5% (11) of patients admitted were health-care workers. ​Table 1 ​shows the
demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients.
The median (IQR) time between symptoms onset and hospital admission was 4 days (2-7).
Fever was referred by 91,1% (153) of patients followed by shortness of breath (52.4% [88]
patients). The main ICU admission criteria were clinical monitoring (59.5% of patients [100]),
and 40.5% (68) of patients needed MV at ICU arrival. The median time up to ICU admission
was 7 days (4-9) since symptoms onset.
Radiologic and laboratory findings
All patients had chest x-rays at ICU admission, 98.2% (165) revealed abnormal results. The
most common pattern on chest x-rays was bilateral patchy shadowing in 72% (121) with a
median (IQR) RALE score of 7 (4-7). The presence of pleural effusion was infrequent (9.5%
[16] of chest x-rays).

On ICU admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 73.2% (123) of patients,
thrombocytopenia in 19.6% (33), and leukopenia in 6.5% (11).
Among MV survivors and MV non-survivors, no difference was found in total leukocyte count
(median [IQR], 7292 mm​3 [5867-9847] in MV survivors vs. 9004 mm​3 [6455-12819] in MV
non-survivors; ​p​=0.1313) nor absolute neutrophil count (median [IQR], 6034 mm​3
[4319-7827] in MV survivors vs. 7609 mm​3​ [5238-10980] in MV non-survivors; ​p​=0.3366).
Regarding lymphocytes, absolute cell count was significantly higher among non-MV patients
than MV patients (median [IQR], 867 mm​3​ [571-1148] vs. 668 mm​3​ [461-1005]; ​p​=0.0042),
and also, a significantly higher count was registered in MV survivors than MV non-survivors
​ 0.0294).

Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher among non-MV patients than MV survivors

p=
(median [IQR], 11,2 [6,3-22,4] vs. 12,9 [4,9-25,3]; ​p​=0.9913).
The majority of patients had elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers like CRP, ferritin and
IL-6. ProBNP was higher among ventilated patients vs. non-ventilated (median [IQR], 520
pg/ml [199-1189] vs. 172 [49-526]; ​p​=0,0004). Also, among overall, non-surviving patients
had more prominent laboratory abnormalities including proBNP and d-dimer than survivors
(median [IQR], 690 pg/ml [362-2062] vs. 435 pg/ml [128-939]; ​p​=0.0106 and 1158 ng/ml
[826-1817] vs. ng/ml 818 [618-1305]; ​p​=0,0097). ​Table 2 ​shows the radiologic and
laboratory findings at ICU admission. ​Figure 1 ​shows laboratory results among non-MV,
patients, MV survivors and MV non-survivors.
Mechanical ventilation
A total of 114 patients (67.9%) required endotracheal intubation and invasive MV. No patient
was treated with noninvasive ventilation. On the first day of MV, the median positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 10 (8-11) cm H​2​O. PEEP levels as high as 16 cm H​2​O
were applied. Among a total of 114 patients, 75 (65.7%) required a fraction of inspired
oxygen (FIO2) of at least 50%, and 11 (9.4%) required 100% FIO2. The median PaO2/FIO2
ratio was 200 (IQR, 147-268). Also, lower PaO2/FIO2 ratios on the first day of MV were
registered among non-survivors vs. survivors (median [IQR], 180 [120-214] vs. 216
[167-290]; ​p​=0.0309). All MV patients fulfilled Berlin criteria for Acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS)​7​.
Regarding respiratory mechanics, the median plateau pressure (P​plat​) on the first day of MV
was 22 (19-24) cm H​2​O, the median driving pressure (ΔP) was 11 (10-14) cm H​2​O and the
median respiratory system compliance (Crs) was 36 (30-47) ​ml/​cm H​2​O.
A majority of the mechanically ventilated patients (84 [73.7%]) required neuromuscular
blockade due to severe hypoxemia to avoid patient-ventilator asynchronies. Also, prone
position ventilation was applied to 41 patients (36%), and 36,1% of them (15 patients)
required more than one prone positioning session. 12 patients (10.5%) received inhaled

nitric oxide (iNO) and 6 (5.7%) were connected to veno-venous extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (V-V ECMO) because of refractory hypoxemia.
The time elapse of MV was 16 days (19-30) among overall ventilated patients and 8 days
(6-14) among those who were successfully extubated (26 [22.8%]). 32 patients (28.1%)
underwent percutaneous tracheostomy due to prolonged weaning. The median time of MV
until tracheostomy was 20 days (15-27). 10 patients (8.7%) remained under MV at data cut
off. ​Table 3 ​shows respiratory mechanics, oxygenation parameters and adjunctive therapies
applied.
Treatment and complications
Most of the patients received dexamethasone (on RECOVERY-trial dose​9​) and empirical
intravenous antibiotic therapy (143 [85,1%] and 133 [79,2%], respectively). 90 patients
(53,6%) were included in a 2:1 blinded-protocol of convalescent plasma against placebo.
Other treatments like ritonavir/lopinavir (23 [13.7%]) and tocilizumab (3 [1.8%]) were less
frequently applied.
A common ICU related complication was delirium that was identified in 121 patients (72%)
overall. Delirium was less present among non-ventilated patients (23 [42.5%]) in comparison
with ventilated patients that survived (61 [89,7%]) and those who died (37 [80.4%]). Other
complications registered were catheter-related sepsis (23 [13.7%]), pressure ulcers (17
[20.1%]), urosepsis (10 [6%]) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (11 [6.5%])
Among overall patients, the median duration of hospitalization was 21 days (14-32) and the
median length of stay in ICU was 13 days (6-24). ICU length of stay among survivors was 5
days (3-8) for non-ventilated patients and 23 days (16-31) for those patients who required
invasive MV. Overall ICU mortality of this series was 25% (42). ​Table 4 shows treatments,
ICU related complications, and clinical outcomes at data cutoff.
DISCUSSION
The population in this study consisted mostly of men (66%) with a median age of 67 (58-75)
years old, which is substantially high compared to the median age of all the positive
Argentinian cases of COVID-19 (38 years old)​10​. The previous suggests that gender and age
are risk factors for admission to the ICU, as previously reported​11​. Moreover, in this cohort,
most of the patients (79.7%) had at least one comorbidity, with a large proportion of patients
with hypertension (52.4%) and obesity (41,6%).
In this case series, the majority of patients were admitted to the ICU because of acute
hypoxemic respiratory failure that required clinical monitoring. An important proportion of
patients needed respiratory support and endotracheal intubation at ICU arrival.
Endotracheal intubation and invasive MV were needed in 67.9% of the patients, whereas
only 32.1% could be managed with oxygen delivery by a non-rebreather mask. Setting
primary focus on health-care personnel security, no patient received non-invasive MV (eg.
continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, or high flow
nasal cannula) due to the risk of aerosol dispersion​12​. There is still controversy regarding the
efficacy of non-invasive MV devices to avoid endotracheal intubation​13 but the need for

invasive MV in this patient population under study was similar to other ICUs where
non-invasive MV was applied: 65% (São Paulo, Brazil)​14​, 71% (Washington State, United
States)​15​, 71% (Wuhan, China)​16​, 80.8% (Detroit, United States)​17​, 88% (Lombardy region,
Italy)​18​, 96.7% (Mexico City, Mexico)​19​.
Among ventilated patients, 44.7% (51) presented paO2/FiO2 lower than 200 on the first day
of MV, although pulmonary mechanics were almost normal (median P​plat 22 cm H​2​O [19-24]
and median ΔP 11 cm H​2​O [10-14]). Nevertheless, 79.8% (91 patients) had low Crs (<50
​
ml/​cm H​2​O) with a median Crs of 36 ​ml/​cm H​2​O (30-47) despite of lung-protective ventilation
(tidal volume ≤ 8 ml/kg predicted body-weight). These findings are in accordance with
information that reported that COVID-19 ARDS respiratory features are similar to
non‑COVID-19 ARDS​20​. Additionally, the values of Crs, Pplat, and ΔP were very similar to
previously published cohorts of non-COVID-19 ARDS patients​21​.
Due to refractory hypoxemia, 6 patients (5.7%) were connected to V-V ECMO. Despite the
middle-income country circumstances and the low volume of patients of the ECMO program,
outcomes are comparable to international series. ECMO survival and survival to discharge
was 66% and 50%, respectively​22​,​23​,​24​.
Since patients required MV for a long period of time, due to prolonged weaning, there were
more that underwent percutaneous tracheostomy compared to those who were successfully
extubated (32 patients [28.1%] and 26 patients [22.8%], respectively). At the beginning of
the pandemic, several scientific societies warned about a possible increase in the request for
tracheostomies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection​25​,​26​,​27​,29​. The need for tracheostomies in
critically ill COVID-19 patients ranges from 36% to 53%, according to the data found in the
literature​28–30​.
Prioritizing the protection of health personnel, tracheostomy was considered possible only in
patients who were expected to obtain a substantial benefit. Ideally, it was performed 21 days
after intubation with a negative RT-PCR test​31​. Following that criteria and up to data cutoff,
none of the surgeons or intensivists who performed tracheostomies developed symptoms or
tested positive for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a longer time of MV prior to tracheostomy was
observed in relation to a previous series from the same center in a non-pandemic scenario
(median 20 days [15-27] and 9 days [6-12], respectively)​32​.
ICU mortality rate was slightly lower than a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of
observational studies that informed a 41.6% (34.0-49.7) ICU mortality rate across
international studies. This could be explained because, optimistically, countries in the later
phase of the pandemic may be coping better with COVID-19​33​.
Although this study is considered limited due to the relatively small number of patients from a
single center and could not be broadly applicable to other patients with critical illness, it
definitely provides initial experience regarding characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with
critical illness in South America.
