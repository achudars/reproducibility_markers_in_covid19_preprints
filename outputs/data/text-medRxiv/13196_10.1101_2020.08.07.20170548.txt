Social Media Reveals Psychosocial Effects of the COVID19 Pandemic
Abstract
Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused
several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties
surrounding the pandemic have also led to multi-faceted mental health concerns,
which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing
and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and
job loss. Despite noting this as a “mental health tsunami,” the psychological effects of
the COVID-19 crisis remains unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health
stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored
support during these circumstances.
Objective: Our work aims to provide insights regarding people’s psychosocial
concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to
study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and
support expressions in the pandemic context.
Methods: We obtain ∼60M Twitter streaming posts originating from the U.S. from
24 March-24 May 2020, and compare these with ∼40M posts from a comparable
period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people’s social media selfdisclosure. Using these datasets, we study people’s self-disclosure on social media in
terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We
employ transfer learning classifiers that identify the social media language
indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal
ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examine the
changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020
and 2019 datasets.

Results: We find that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have
significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis – mental health symptomatic
expressions have increased by ~14%, and support expressions have increased by
~5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observe a steady decline and
eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may
have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during
this period. Our language analyses highlight that people express concerns that are
very specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis.
Conclusions: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using
social media data from 2020, finding that people’s mental health symptomatic and
support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as
compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over
time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their “new normal”.
Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns
regarding personal and professional challenges, healthcare and precautionary
measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This work shows the potential to
provide insights to mental healthcare and stakeholders and policymakers in
planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amidst the
health crisis.

Introduction
The impacts of global public health emergencies extend beyond medical
repercussions – they affect individuals and societies on many levels, causing
disruptions [1,2]. In an article written by the American Psychological Association
following the Ebola outbreak [3], the epidemic was described as an “epidemic of
fear” – in the United States, it was described by the media as “fearbola,” to describe a
paranoia that infected the country. Reports of similar feelings of anxiety, stress, and
uncertainty have been repeatedly reported during other global outbreaks and
pandemics [4]. The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, has led to a
pandemic of illness (coronavirus disease, or COVID-19) that has globally caused
16M cases and 700K deaths, reported as of the end of July 2020 [5]. According to
recent surveys from the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and other studies, the COVID-19 crisis has been reported to be
associated with rapid rises in psychological distress across many nations [6], with
women, the young, the less educated, and some ethnic minority groups reporting

greater mental health strain [7]. On the one hand, persons are worried about the
direct effects of potential infection, including fears of death, lasting disabilities, or
exacerbating chronic illnesses. On the other, actions to mitigate the spread of
COVID-19, including social distancing, quarantines, and business closures with
resulting job losses, are a powerful source of life disruptions and emotional distress.
Fear and anxiety about a disease as infectious as COVID-19 can trigger new-onset or
exacerbate existing mental illness [8]. Therefore, the practical impact of the crisis is
far greater than the actual number of infection cases or fatalities [8,9]. While
expressions of distress may stem from concern and worry relating to the direct
impacts of the disease, they may relate as much to disruption of regular routines,
sleep and eating patterns, having out-of-school children at home full-time, economic
hardships and unusual volatility in financial markets, and forced geographical
displacement or confinement. Indeed, some people are at risk of developing posttraumatic distress due to exposure to the multi-faceted uncertainties, or from
confronting dying persons or lost loved ones. While disease mitigating efforts such
as “social distancing” and “self-quarantining” are recommended [10–12] individuals
in medical isolation may experience increased symptoms of anxiety and depression,
as well as feelings of fear, abandonment, loneliness, and stigmatization [13,14].
Despite concerns about the myriad of social and behavioral issues associated with
the COVID-19 pandemic [15,16], research has been scant to examine its
psychosocial impacts or how to predict and mitigate them. Although it is anticipated
that COVID-19 will have broadly ramifying effects [17,18], public health workers
and crisis interventionists are limited in their ability to extend services and support
in a timely, preemptive fashion. Although surveys are a step forward to support
such efforts [7], due to their retrospective recall bias, limited scalability, and without
being able to provide real-time insights, public health workers are not only unable
to prioritize services for the most vulnerable populations, but more specifically, less
equipped to direct prevention efforts towards individuals with greater propensities
for adverse psychological impacts.
This paper seeks to address the above gap by drawing insights into people’s
expressed mental health concerns by leveraging social media data. The rise in online
and social media activity has provided an unprecedented opportunity to enhance
the identification and monitoring strategies of various mental and psychosocial
disorders [7,19]. Over 80% of U.S. adults use social media daily [20], placing it ahead
of texting, email, and instant messaging, and disclose considerably more about
themselves online than offline [21,22]. Social media provides a real-time platform
where people often candidly self-disclose their concerns, opinions, and struggles
during this pandemic [23]. In particular, our work targets the following research

aims:
Aim 1: To quantitatively assess the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 pandemic using
social media data.
Aim 2: To examine how the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 pandemic have varied
over time.
Aim 3: To examine if social media language reflects the major psychosocial concerns
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the above research questions, we measure psychosocial effects in terms of
symptomatic mental health expressions of anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal
ideation, and expressions seeking emotional and informational support. Our work is
founded on a large body of work on studying mental health and psychosocial
dynamics with social media data [24–30]. Several studies have leveraged Twitter
(which is also the data of our current study) to study health attributes and public
health [30], including symptoms related to diseases [31], disease contagion [32],
obesity and physical health [33], mood and depressive disorders [28,34], mental
health self-disclosures [27], post-traumatic stress disorder [35], addictive behaviors
and substance use [36,37], etc. Because social media data (and Twitter posts in
particular) are recorded in-the-moment they provide rich information about both
the individual as well as the larger world [30]. In particular, we draw on two kinds
of prior work --- on symptomatic mental health expressions and on support
expressions. Related to the former, Saha et al. (2019), in their study on the effects of
psychiatric medications on Twitter, developed classifiers of mental health
symptomatic expressions using social media language, which we replicate in our
current work [25]. Related to the latter, we draw upon Sharma and De Choudhury
(2018) and Saha and Sharma (2020) developed classifiers of social support
expressions, specifically emotional and informational support [38,39].

Methods
Data
To study people’s psychosocial expressions on social media, we obtain Twitter data.
Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms, and its public-facing,
micro-blogging based design enables candid self-disclosure and self-expressions for
individuals [27].
Twitter Streaming API. We collect data in our study using the Twitter Streaming
API. Twitter Streaming API is an official data collection API that Twitter shares with
researchers providing free access to 1% sample of its data on a set of parameters set

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170548; this version posted October 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

by researchers. That is, for a given set of parameters, Twitter queries the volume of
available data at a particular moment [40]. If the volume of the query exceeds 1% of
all Twitter posts at that moment, then the response is sampled to be less than 1%.
However, the Twitter Streaming API is like a black-box with a lack of transparency
in the sampling methodology [41,42], yet, this is one of the few forms of unfettered
and large-scale social media data access to researchers outside social media
companies [43], and has also used in a number of prior work, including health
[35,44,45]. The Discussion section revisits the limitations of our study due to the
challenges of Twitter Streaming API.
For the purposes of our study, we use two kinds of parameters, 1) language of a
Twitter post as “english”, and 2) geo-location bounds set to be within the geographic
coordinates of U.S. Therefore, our ensuing analyses concern Twitter data that at
least fulfill both these criteria. We note that the location filter additionally prevents
any retweets in the dataset as retweets are not geo-location labeled by design on
Twitter [40], allowing us to study only originally created Twitter posts.
Treatment Data. In particular, we focus our study on the U.S. population and
leverage the Twitter Streaming API. Using geo-bounded coordinates, we collect 1%
of real-time Twitter data originating from the U.S. We collect 59,096,694 Twitter
posts between March 24, 2020, and May 24, 2020. Because this dataset comes from
the same period when the COVID-19 outbreak occurred, we label this dataset as the
Treatment dataset. We note that this period saw an exponential growth in reported
COVID-19 infection cases (~50K to ~1M) and fatalities (~1K to ~56K) in the U.S.
[46]. During these two months, federal and state policies and laws were enacted to
control or mitigate the spread of the outbreak, including school and work closures,
stay-at-home orders, and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act [47].
Control Data. To understand the social media expressions particularly attributed to
the COVID-19 crisis, we obtain a control dataset that originates from the same
geographical location (U.S.) and similar time period, but from the previous year
(2019). Prior work [47,48] motivates this approach of obtaining control data that
acts as a baseline and likely minimizes confounding effects due to geo-temporal
seasonality in lifestyle, activities, experiences, and unrelated events that may have
some psychosocial bearing. We obtain a similarly-sized dataset of 40,875,185
Twitter posts shared between March 24, 2019, and May 24, 2019.
Both the above Treatment and Control datasets have been collected in real-time and
therefore, they are the entire 1% sample of Twitter posts returned in real-time, and
we do not conduct any additional sampling on this data. We note that the size of
Control data is smaller than that of Treatment [42]despite each consisting of the

same two months duration. This could be because the volume of Twitter posts in
[40,42]the entire Twitter increased significantly in 2020 [49] leading to an increase
in 1% sample as well. However, we cannot make any such conclusion, especially
because of the lack of transparency in how Twitter conducts the 1% sampling [42].
Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19
Towards our first research aim of understanding the psychosocial impacts of the
COVID-19 outbreak, we conduct two types of analysis on our Twitter dataset, which
we describe below. Our work builds upon the vast, rapidly growing literature
studying mental health concerns and psychosocial expressions within social media
data [19,21,24–28,34,48,50–52].
Symptomatic Mental Health Expressions
Drawing on the work referenced above, we hypothesize that people’s self-disclosure
expressions on social media can reveal symptomatic mental health expressions
attributed to the COVID-19 crisis. We examine symptomatic expressions of anxiety,
depression, stress, and suicidal ideation. These are not only some of the most critical
mental health concerns but also have been attributed to be consequences of the
pandemic outbreak [15,53,54].
To identify mental health symptomatic expressions in social media language, Saha et
al. (2019) built machine learning classifiers [25] using transfer learning
methodologies --- the main idea here is to infer mental health attributes in an
unlabeled data by transferring a classifier trained on a different labeled dataset.
These classifiers are n-gram (n=1,2,3) based binary Support Vector Machine (SVM)
models where the positive class of the training datasets stems from appropriate
Reddit communities (r/depression for depression, r/anxiety for anxiety, r/stress for
stress, and r/SuicideWatch for suicidal ideation), and the negative class of training
datasets comes from non-mental health-related content on Reddit — a collated
sample of 20M posts, gathered from 20 subreddits from the landing page of Reddit
during appropriately the same period as the mental health subreddit posts, such as
r/AskReddit, r/aww, r/movies, and others. These classifiers perform at a high
accuracy of approximately 0.90 on average on held-out test data [25].
Clinical Validity. Saha et al.’s classifiers, used here, have also been shown to
transfer well on Twitter with an 87% agreement between machine-predicted labels
and expert appraisal [25,48],, where experts annotated posts in the classification
test data using DSM-5 [55] criteria of mental health symptoms. Bagroy et al. [55,56]
reported additional validation of such derived insights with feedback from clinical
experts. In this work, the outcomes of the mental health expression classifiers were

compared with those given by human coders on the same (random) sample of social
media posts; the latter coded the posts based on a codebook developed using prior
qualitative and quantitative studies of mental health disclosures on social media and
literature in psychology on markers of mental health expressions. Coders not only
agreed with the outcomes of the classifiers (Cohen’s κ was 0.83), but also noted that
the classifiers could identify explicit expressions of first-hand experience of
psychological distress or mental health concerns (“i get overwhelmingly
depressed”) as well as expressions of support, help, or advice around difficult life
challenges and experiences (“are there any resources I can use to talk to someone
about depression?”). Further details about these classifiers, including their detailed
performance, predictive features demonstrating model interpretability, and efficacy
of transfer to Twitter data, may be found in [25,48,56]. We use these classifiers to
machine label both our Treatment and Control datasets. Table 1 shows example
Twitter posts in our dataset which exhibit mental health symptomatic expressions
(because many of these labels are comorbid, we show example posts that exhibit
one or more of these mental health symptomatic expressions).
Table 1. Example paraphrased posts in the Treatment data that exhibit high
symptomatic mental health expressions.

The kind of person I am, I don’t deserve to meet these people (Depression)
2020 is the saddest year. There is a lack of money, necessities needed for daily life are gone
from stores!. I am at work as a healthcare professional hurting for my patients because they
can’t see their family. (Anxiety, Stress)
I am too overwhelmed by school and having a crippling anxiety to keep up with everything
online I’m seriously NOT OK! I CAN’T TAKE THIS! (Anxiety, Suicidal Ideation)
During the online lecture, the prof. asked each of us how we were doing and feeling, I said, I
am too anxious to know what’s next, and i keep thinking about what’s gonna happen, and
she was like okay chill! (Depression, Anxiety, Stress)

Support Expressions
Social support is considered an essential component in helping people cope with
psychological distress [57]. Research reports that supportive interactions can even
have a “buffering effect” [57,58]; that is, they can be protective against the negative
consequences of mental health. With the wide adoption of web and social media
technologies, support-seeking (and providing) is increasingly happening online and
has been shown to be efficacious [21,59]. In fact, a meta-analysis indicates that
online support is effective in decreasing depression and increasing self-efficacy and
quality of life [60]. In the context of suicide, certain types of social support in Reddit
communities may reduce the chances of future suicidal ideation among those

seeking mental health help [61]. Oh et al. further showed that surveyed Facebook
users demonstrate a positive relationship between having health concerns and
seeking health-related social support [62]. Indeed, during global crises such as
COVID-19, when many of the physical sites for healthcare (including mental health)
have been closed or have very restricted access, it is likely that online support has
proliferated [63]. Fear of potential infection may further have alienated individuals
in need to pursue formal treatment, therapy, and support, perhaps channelizing
their support seeking efforts online and on social media.
According to the “Social Support Behavioral Code” [64], two forms of support that
have received theoretical and empirical attention are emotional and informational
support. Emotional support (ES) corresponds to empathy, encouragement, and
kindness, while informational support (IS) corresponds to information, guidance,
and suggestions [38,65]. These two forms of support have been found to be most
prevalent and effective in several studies of online support and social media
[38,62,66,67]. Social media enables individuals to self-disclose and express in
making their emotional and informational needs known and sought [67]. Andalibi et
al. found that these two kinds of support can co-occur with other forms of support,
such as posts seeking emotional support often seek esteem and network support
[66], and Attai et al. noted that Twitter is effective in seeking and providing healthrelated informational needs [68], contextually related with our problem of interest.
To identify support expressions on social media, we use an expert-appraised dataset
and classifier built in prior work [38,39]. These are binary SVM classifiers
identifying the degree (high/low) of ES and IS in social media posts. When the
predictions of these classifiers were cross-validated with expert annotations from
Sharma and De Choudhury’s data [38], the classifiers were found to have k-fold
cross-validation accuracies of 0.71 and 0.77 in ES and IS classifications respectively
[39]. Similar to the symptomatic expressions classifiers, the classifiers of support
expressions are transferred from Reddit and typically perform well in our dataset
due to the high linguistic equivalence between Reddit and Twitter datasets [34]. We
further manually inspect a random set of 125 Twitter posts in our dataset using the
methods outlined in prior work [25,56] to rate each Twitter post with binary high or
low ES and IS. We find that the manual ratings and classifier ratings show a high
agreement of 88% and 93%, respectively, indicating statistical significant transfer
classification on Twitter. We use these classifiers to label the presence of ES and IS
in our Treatment and Control datasets. Table 2 shows a few example paraphrased
posts of support expressions in our Treatment dataset.

According to my mom, kindness is needed more than ever now. So, send love to you! How
are you being kind to others today? (Emotional Support)

Examining Psychosocial Expressions over Time and Language
Next, we describe methods to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic may have
caused changes in psychological expressions by comparing our Treatment (outbreak
year) and Control (no-outbreak year) datasets. For both our datasets, we aggregate
the number of posts that express symptomatic and support expressions by day and
by type. We compare the pervasiveness of each kind of measure in the datasets,
along with conducting statistical significance in their differences using 2-sample ttests and effect sizes (Cohen’s d).
Temporal Variation
For our second research aim, we compare the daily variation of measures between
Treatment and Control datasets, we transform our data into standardized z-scores.
Our datasets rely on the Twitter streaming API, and are subject to daily
inconsistencies of available data each day [41]. Transformed z-scores are not
sensitive to such absolute values and inconsistencies, and essentially quantify the
number of standard deviations by which the value of the raw score is above or
below the mean. Similar standardization techniques have been adopted in prior
social media time-series studies [48,69]. z-scores are calculated as (x−μ)/σ, where x
is the raw value, μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the population.
Here, to obtain population μ and σ, in addition to our Treatment and Control data,
we also include a year-long Twitter data of over 240M Twitter posts (September
2018 to August 2019). For each of the measures in symptomatic and support
expressions, we first calculate μ and σ on the per-day occurrence of that particular
measure in the dataset of over 300M Twitter posts (combining 240M posts between
September 2018 and August 2019 and 60M posts in Treatment data between March
and May 2020). Then, for each measure, we calculate the z-score per day and
interpret positive z-scores as values above the mean, and negative z-scores as those
below the mean.

Linguistic Differences
For our third research aim, we examine COVID-19 related linguistic differences in
the psychosocial expressions on social media, we employ an unsupervised language
modeling technique, the Sparse Additive Generative Model (SAGE) [70]. Given any
two datasets, SAGE selects salient keywords by comparing the parameters of two
logistically parameterized-multinomial models using a self-tuned regularization
parameter to control the tradeoff between frequent and rare keywords. We conduct
SAGE to identify distinguishing n-grams (n=1,2,3) between the Treatment and
Control datasets, where each n-gram is returned with a SAGE score. The magnitude
of an n-gram’s SAGE score signals the degree of its “uniqueness” or saliency, and in
our case a positive SAGE score (above 0) indicates that the n-gram is more salient in
the Treatment data, whereas a negative SAGE score (below 0) denotes greater
saliency in the Control data.
SAGE allows us to obtain how the expressions differ during the COVID-19 outbreak
as compared to the Control period. We conduct two SAGE analyses, one each for
symptomatic and support expressions. For the symptomatic expressions, we first
obtain posts that are indicative of either of anxiety, depression, stress, or suicidal
ideation in Treatment and Control, and obtain SAGE for the two datasets. We do
similar for support expressions by obtaining posts that are indicative of either
emotional or informational support.
Finally, we cross-examine the salient keywords across symptomatic and support
expressions, to study how concerns are prevalent in either or both of the kinds of
expressions. We measure log-likelihood ratios (LLR) along with add-1 smoothing,
where LLR close to 0 indicates comparable frequencies, LLR<1 indicates the greater
frequency in symptomatic expressions and LLR>1 indicates the greater frequency in
support expressions. Together these linguistic analyses enable us to obtain
psychological concerns, and understand how COVID-19 has psychosocially affected
individuals, and to contextualize these concerns in the literature on consequences of
global crises.

Results
We summarize our first set of results in Table 1. For all our measures, we find
statistical significance (as per t-tests) as well as significant effect sizes (Cohen’s d >
0.4 for all measures [71]) in social media expressions in the Treatment data as
compared to that in Control. Assuming that most other confounders were minimized
due to the geo-temporal similarity of the datasets, our findings indicate that the
COVID-19 outbreak led to an increase in people’s symptomatic and support
expressions of mental health. We elaborate on the results below.

Treatment and Control show significant differences in the people’s symptomatic
expressions (Table 3), among which, anxiety shows the most significant increase
(21.32%), followed by suicidal ideation (19.73%), depression (10.18%), and stress
(3.76%). Figure 1b shows the evolution of support expressions change in the
Treatment and Control datasets. Like above, the differences are significant (Table 3),
and we find that not only emotional support increases by 4.77%, and informational
support also increases by 4.78%.
In both the plots of Figure 1, we find a general trend of negative slope (avg. slope = 0.03) within the Treatment year, which is closer to zero slope (avg. slope =
3.19*10−4) in the Control dataset. This may suggest that within the Treatment year,
people’s mental health expressions gradually leveled out over time, despite the
growing rate of COVID-19 active cases. The plots indicate that psychological
expressions almost converge at the tails. This could likely be due to people’s
habituation with the situation and surroundings with the passage of time [70,72], as
has been observed for other crisis events [48,73]; however, this needs to be
explored further. Within the Control dataset, we observe a sudden peak on April 28,
2019, which could be attributed to a shooting incident at a synagogue in San Diego
[74]. The observations reflect that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased people’s
mental health expressions on social media, aligning with other contemporary
literature and media reports [8,53].

Symptomatic Mental Health Expressions
Table 4 summarizes the language differences as per SAGE for posts expressing high
mental health expressions in Treatment and Control periods --- keywords with
positive SAGE saliently occur in Treatment, whereas those with negative SAGE
saliently occur in the Control data. A majority of the keywords that occur in the
Treatment period are contextually related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as

covid19, coronavirus, social distancing, stayathome isolation. These keywords are
used in posts expressing mental health concerns either explicitly, e.g., “Social
distancing is both sad and anxiety-inducing at the same moment”, or implicitly, e.g.,
“In order to get my family treated, I will do more than beg, and I will donate 25K for
research to develop COVID19 vaccine.” We also find that the Treatment period uses
keywords referring to key personnel such as dr fauci (referring to Anthony Fauci,
one of the leads in the incumbent White House Coronavirus Task Force in the U.S.
and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984
[75]) and political figures like Nury Martinez and Donald Trump. Further, we find
keywords, such as essential workers, doctor jobs, and risking lives, which describe
high-risk worker situations, e.g., “I am not complaining about going to work, rather, I
am concerned about risking my health for work.”, and certain treatment suggestions
that evolved during this period [76] such as garlic, malaria, and hydroxychloroquine,
e.g., “I do worry tho!He is focused on job numbers, approval? ratings and repeating
mistruths. His spouting of 2 drugs, one for malaria & the other a Z-pack.A Senior
couple tried these untested drugs; wife is in ICU & husband also hospitalized! This is
irresponsible & dangerous!”

Support Expressions
Table 5 lists the top keywords as per SAGE for support posts in Treatment and
Control period. Like above, keywords with positive SAGE saliently occur in
Treatment, whereas those with negative SAGE saliently occur in the Control data; we
find keywords that explicitly relate to COVID-19 occur in the Treatment period. We
also find that the Treatment period consists of posts that seek support related to job
and pay such as, losing jobs, need pay, and furloughed, e.g., “Many in our community
have lost their jobs, are underinsured and are struggling to make ends meet.
Providing pantries, hot meals, hotspots and distance learning opportunities is now
more critical than ever, please donate.” Our data also reveals the prevalence of
contextually related keywords such as masks, ppe, hoarding, stockpile, and sanitizer
that are medically recommended prevention and containment measures of COVID19 infection, e.g., “Please contact me if you have any N95 mask or know to obtain
some. My sister and a few friend work in the OR and they do not have the supplies to
stay safe, they have patients who have #COVID19. TY! #HealthcareHeroes.”

Linguistic Comparability
Finally, Table 6 shows the results of the lexical comparability analysis, where log
likelihood ratios (LLRs) demarcate the top keywords used for symptomatic mental
health expressions and support expressions within the Treatment dataset. We find
that keywords, such as safety precautions (wear masks), healthcare and treatment
(health care workers, hospitalized, beds, and icu), and life/death (passed away, kill
people, human lives, and deaths) comparably overlap in both kinds of psychological
expressions (LLR~0). These keywords are also used to raise awareness and express
solidarity with healthcare and high-risk workers, e.g., “Taking all safety precautions
and adhering to the guidelines established by our health care professionals will keep
us safe.” Our lexico-psychological analyses reveal that more clinically relevant
keywords and symptoms occur frequently in symptomatic expressions (LLR>0), e.g.,
sleep schedule and tested positive, whereas, socially relevant and stressful
circumstances are more prevalent in support expressions (LLR<0), e.g., im single
parent, starve, and lost jobs.

Discussion
Principal Results
Our study suggests that social media posts during the COVID-19 pandemic contain a
significantly higher frequency of symptomatic mental health and support
expressions than a comparable dataset from the same period in the previous year.
The effect sizes and statistical differences observed in our analyses provide
evidence that the COVID-19 may have led to mental health concerns compared to
other normative times. We also find that they topically relate to the ongoing crisis
situation, and include concerns such as: treatment, precautionary measures, loss of
jobs, school closings, stockpiling of basic livelihood necessities, feeling lonely, bored,
and tired of the restrictions and constraints put on by the ongoing pandemic, and so
on. Our findings suggest that although the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified mental
health risks and concerns, it may have heightened a sense of belonging and
solidarity among individuals — bringing them together, raising collective
awareness, and encouraging them to provide support to one another. We also find
expressions of solidarity with healthcare and high-risk workers, suggesting that
people have been considerate about these workers, who have expressed desire to
set up opportunities for donating to those who have lost jobs during the crisis --this also aligns with recent media reports and WHO guidelines of tackling the
pandemic [77,78]. Media reports have also indicated how benevolent neighbors
have been tending to their elderly neighbors by delivering their groceries and other
basic necessities [79].
However, mental health experts say that while the crisis is amplifying risk factors
for suicide, the coronavirus outbreak’s effect on individuals’ mental and emotional
wellbeing is complex [80]. Suicide is multifaceted, and while economic loss is a risk
factor, so are depression, isolation and fear of the future. At the same time, the crisis
is possibly creating a sense of belonging for individuals at risk for suicide as stress
and anxiety are normalized, and people come together to better support one
another during a crisis [81,82]. Our data shows a significant impact of COVID-19 on
suicidal ideation which calls for enhanced importance about population-scale
mental healthcare, such as using approaches like universal screening (i.e., Zero
Suicide Model)[83]. As Florida noted in a recent article [84]: “The long-term toll on
mental health of social isolation, remote work, and economic insecurity could have
impacts akin to post-traumatic stress disorder; yet, the new focus on mental health
may reduce stigma and increase the availability of support services.” Indeed, the
world beyond the crisis may be one in which mental health is more honestly
recognized and supported.
Interestingly, we note that our findings indicate a gradual leveling out of these

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170548; this version posted October 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

expressions — both symptomatic and supportive, may reflect a developing ‘new
normal.’ In February 2020, it seemed unthinkable the white-collar workforce of
many countries would soon be working solely from home, it seemed unthinkable air
travel would plummet by 96%, and all major sporting events will be called off.
Indeed, epidemiologists surmise that many if not most of the changes surrounding
the rhythms of our daily life are likely to fade over time, just as they did after the
1918 influenza epidemic [84]. In other words, the pandemic would make us revisit
and possibly reform many of our lifestyle choices and civic roles, and the persistent
discussion of the ‘new normal’ may help bring order to our current turbulence.
Others have argued that perhaps the crisis is an prelude to a ‘new paradigm,’ as
recently noted by the World Economic Forum [84,85]: “Feeling unsettled,
destabilized and alone can help us empathize with individuals who have faced
systematic exclusions long-ignored by society even before the rise of COVID-19 –
thus stimulating urgent action to improve their condition.” We should therefore
“revel in the discomfort of the current moment to generate a ‘new paradigm,’ not a
‘new normal.’ The leveling out trend in our data gives empirical ground to these
conjectures.
Nevertheless, if robust antiviral treatments are developed and rolled out relatively
quickly and/or if a vaccine becomes available soon enough, presumably, the changes
will be short-lived, and the new normal may be temporary. But if the pandemic
comes back in larger waves over the next few seasons, like was the case with
historical epidemics, the economic, political, and social crises that have arisen as a
consequence will lead to deeper ramifications in turn leading to longer-lasting or
permanent changes. Future research will need to explore the persistence of the new
normal and the emergence of a possible new paradigm as the pandemic evolves, and
therein the mental health impacts further along in the crisis. A study like ours on the
ongoing pandemic is a step towards leveraging large-scale online data to
understand people’s response to the crisis, and thinking about means to address the
major concerns. Our work bears implications in digital technology driven mental
health interventions to provide tailored support to people’s concerns during the
crisis --- as a recent work by Rudd and Beidas pointed out four point guidelines to
build innovative and expansive solutions towards improving public mental health
[86]. The variety of concerns and help-seeking factors reflected in our study can also
help several stakeholders ranging across mental health facilitators and policy
makers towards early preparedness and interventions for mental health support.
Similarly, our methods can offer the potential to build public health surveillance
technologies that surface early warning signs of the effects of the various events
related to the pandemic and other crises. The potential of social media to assist in
the response to the pandemic is clear but also dependent on the accuracy of

underlying methods. The reach of social media allows for broad access that
transcends national borders or cultural differences. Using this access to meet the
increasing need for help seeking --- online and social media data is in a prime
position to offer people personalized guidance towards accurate information, health
care resources, and even basic lifestyle interventions. Underlying this potential is
thus the ability of social media data to classify the state and needs of each individual,
and use that information to tailor a customized response. Precedents for such a
system are abound as seen in several prior work [27–31,37,87–89].
Comparison with Prior Work
COVID-19 is not the first pandemic — catastrophic pandemics have been occurring
at regular intervals throughout human history, with the 1918 influenza epidemic
being the last one before the current pandemic [84,85,90]. The backdrop of the
1918 pandemic was that it happened just before the advent of modern psychiatry as
a science and a clinical specialty – a time when psychoanalysis was gaining
recognition as an established treatment within the medical community [91,92].
Consequently, psychiatry has had little opportunity to consider such historically
important phenomena through its clinical, scientific lens, until now. Although
outbreaks of the Zika and Ebola virus, MERS, and SARS managed to draw global
attention, stirring up anxiety and uncertainty in societies, scholars have noted that
participation of mental health experts in pandemic preparedness has remained
negligible [93]. Consequently, our ability to understand mental health responses as
well as the mental health burden in pandemic outbreaks have been limited [94]. For
instance, a routinely practiced method of infection control, quarantine and social
distancing have received surprisingly little attention in psychiatric literature so far.
Baumeister and Leary (1995) [95] contended that humans need frequent contacts,
and crisis events further stimulate a need for affiliation and intimacy. Therefore,
prolonged isolation and separation from families and their community can have
profound effects on individuals even if they are not directly affected by the disease
[4]. In the current pandemic, the additional layer of extensive use of social media
and exposure to often sensationalized online news, while in physical isolation, may
add new complexities to implementing emotional epidemiology in managing
concerns, fears, and misconceptions [96,97], as these tools have been argued to bear
negative effects on psychological wellbeing [97],[98].
By adopting social media as a lens to unpack these previously less understood
dimensions of a pandemic’s mental health effects, our work is one step towards
closing some of the above-noted gaps. The published literature posits that the
distress and anxiety among individuals in this COVID-19 pandemic may increase the
incidence of mental disorders [53,54,99]; data thus far from the U.S. point to a

population increase in psychological distress of 10% compared to 2018 data [8], a
trend which is in line with our present results. These rates may be higher in those
regions heavily exposed to COVID-19 or among individuals working during the
pandemic, with a recent review reporting over 20% prevalence of anxiety, also
consistent with our findings [8].
Prior work found that mental health discourse on Twitter ranges across
stigmatizing, inspirational, resource, medical, and social dimensions of expressions
[100], and our study revealed similar topical diversity in our dataset. Further, we
detected through social media many of the stresses associated with the pandemic –
e.g., prolonged isolation, exposure to pandemic-related death, loss of income/career,
increased workload, and lack of pertinent and accurate information. These results
align with epidemiological findings that COVID-19 has led elevated mental health
symptoms for individuals: Nelson et al. (2020) surveyed two thousand individuals
from U.S., Canada, and Europe and found elevated symptoms of anxiety and
depression compared to historical norms, and observed factors similar to the
concerns we detected regarding symptomatic expressions and those related to
seeking support. They also reinforce the summary data released by the Crisis Text
Line (a major crisis helpline in the U.S.) listing major concerns of crisis support
sought during this period [101] — 80% conversations mentioning “virus”, 34%
mentioning “anxiety”, 34% feeling solidarity with friends and family, etc. Along
similar lines, there have been numerous reports about the increasing number of
mental health crisis helpline calls during this period [102,103], providing further
support and external validation that our social media findings reflect many of the
same elements of distress expressed offline during this crisis.
Next, our temporal analyses pointed to a steady decline in people’s expressed
psychosocial concerns during the two month study period (Figure 1), which
conforms with similar findings in Google search queries as stay-at-home orders and
other COVID-19 related policy changes were implemented in the U.S. [104]. We note
contemporary social computing research studying various aspects of the social
media discourse related to COVID-19 [63,105–107]. By providing complementary
evidence to observations by Mackey et al. [105] and Stokes et al. [106] on expressed
(mental health) concerns during the crisis, our work further underscores their
findings using a comparable (control) dataset, reinforcing and providing empirical
credibility to the impression that the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed caused or
contributed directly to the mental health concerns that we describe.
Limitations and Future Work
We note some limitations in our work, many of which present excellent directions
for future research. We recognize the lack of transparency related to the Twitter

streaming API. Recent research has also questioned the credibility of the “1%
Twitter stream” aspect noting that actual sampling data is smaller than what it
ideally should have been [41]. Given these data limitations, we decided against
conducting several descriptive and fine-grained analyses (such as comparing
regions), and refrained from making claims based on comparing absolute numbers
of those impacted by various mental health concerns. For example, we cannot define
based on our data, whether there were increased or decreased Twitter postings
during our COVID-19 study period compared to the same months in 2019. Again, we
chose to filter English-only Twitter posts given both algorithmic limitations of our
methodologies, and lower prevalence of non-English data (particularly in the U.S.
context). However, future work can extend our methodologies to conduct analyses
in other languages to draw richer insights.
Despite the strengths of Twitter as a data source that provides us unobtrusive
access to large-scale, unstructured, and naturalistic data of people’s candid selfdisclosure, and that it has been a valuable source to study disaster and crisis
response [108], we acknowledge that this data inherently suffers from many biases,
such as self-selection and representation [109]. We can only study those who selfselect to express on Twitter. Pew surveys report that social media platforms are
under-representative of minorities, although Twitter is an exception, which overrepresents minorities such as Blacks, Hispanics, and women [20]. There is already a
digital divide in terms of social media use where the population is skewed towards
young adults and white-collar workers. Further, technology and social media could
be a luxury to marginalized and underprivileged populations, and any sort of
technology-driven support and assistance will disproportionately affect different
individuals based on technology use [88]. Similarly, a single platform cannot provide
a complete picture; different platforms (such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, instant
messaging services) have unique design strengths and weaknesses both in terms of
their affordances, as well as who uses them. Therefore, as highlighted in a recent
article by Chunara and Cook (2020), public health surveillance (including that for
COVID-19) can account for several factors such as the “population at risk” in
epidemiology and demographic disparities in the use and behavioral expressions on
social media [23].
We understand that our work is observational, and as any other observational
study, does not measure “true causality”. Watts (2014) noted the impossibility to
test all explanations and confounders simultaneously [110]. However, by including
and comparing against a control data, we minimize geo-temporal and seasonal
confounds, thereby enabling us to provide stronger evidence and insights than
purely correlational analyses regarding the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on

people’s mental health. We also note that support expressions in our study can not
only include support-seeking but also support-providing expressions. This has also
enabled us to observe how solidarity and sense of belonging proliferated during the
COVID-19 crisis. Future work can build separate high precision classifiers for each
kind of expression to disentangle the prevalence of seeking and providing
expressions during the crisis.
Further, while we did have data beyond May 24, 2020, we decided to exclude those
in order to keep our focus on the effects on social media expressions due to COVID19 and minimize those that followed the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, in
the light of the Black Lives Matter protests throughout the U.S. [111]. We also are
aware that, with the continuing nature of the pandemic, our conclusions are
restricted to the mental health and support-seeking concerns expressed during a
finite study period. Events since the end of the study period underscore the dynamic
nature of these events, as different parts of the U.S. are heavily affected, while others
are recovering and some remain relatively spared. It will be important to extend this
work temporally, increase the size of future samples, and, whenever possible, add
geospatial specificity to future analyses. The latter will be especially important for
potential supportive interventions locally, if one has the resources and the ability to
assemble recurring, near-real-time local “snapshots” as a basis for community
focused preventive interventions. Further, our analyses can be extended to
retrospectively examine the aftereffects of particular global and local events (such
as policy changes) related to the pandemic.
Conclusion
Our work, like those of others studying other major events, further reinforces the
potential utility of accessing and analyzing social media data in near-real-time to
‘take the temperature’ of communities. This will require a more focused and robust
collection of locally targeted information to build samples that are sufficiently large
to produce reliably representative datasets to be useful for public health
interventions. Further work is now needed to track mental health-related
expressions and those reflecting needs for support throughout the pandemic, which
has seen dynamic changes associated with disease spread to areas that had been
less affected during the early months of the outbreak. This geospecific research may
further enhance our understanding of the causal connections between COVIDspread and waves of expressed distressed. Having the ability to present locally
pertinent, contemporaneous analyses offers the opportunity for local public health
and mental health providers, as well as political leaders, to develop and deploy
targeted support services in a timely fashion.
