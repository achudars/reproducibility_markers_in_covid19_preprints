Running Title: T cell glycan switch in SARS-CoV-2 infection

27

Abstract

28

COVID-19 is a highly selective disease in which SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in

29

different clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe disease that

30

requires hospitalization. Here, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a

31

glycosylation reprogramming of circulating lymphocytes at diagnosis. We identified a

32

specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently

33

triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at

34

diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated

35

that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor,

36

through the up-regulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of

Introduction

45

Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent responsible for the global pandemic of

46

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), that, as of 9th of February, has infected over

47

106 million people worldwide(1, 2). The overall mortality of COVID-19 is between

48

0.5% and 3.5%(1, 2). COVID-19 is a highly selective disease. In fact, only some

49

infected individuals get sick, and although most of the critically ill are elderly, some

50

patients that die are previously healthy and/or relatively young(3). There is an urgent

51

need to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease, envisioning

52

better management in terms of patients care, treatment options, vaccination strategies

53

and the allocation of healthcare resources. Vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2

54

poses a great promise for the resolution of the pandemic, and several vaccines are now

55

being distributed among the world population, namely mRNA- and protein-based

56

approaches(4, 5). However, its long-term protection, effectiveness to re-infection,

57

efficacy to new variants and availability for the general public is still on trial. This lack

58

of knowledge highlights the importance of understanding patient-specific immune

59

response to infection, envisioning the identification of novel mechanisms of disease.

60

Moreover, comprehensive insights on COVID-19 molecular mechanism may be

61

translated into diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets to improve

62

patient’s clinical management and patients´ stratification for vaccination.

63

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a broad range of symptoms(6). Several studies on

64

immune profiling of infected patients consistently revealed an immunological

65

dysregulation, observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A decrease of

66

T cells and dendritic cells frequencies and an increase of monocytes and neutrophils

67

have been observed in hospitalized infected individuals, as well as a cytokine

68

dysregulation, the so-called “cytokine storm” associated with critical illness(7–10).

69

However the mechanism underlying this immunological dysregulation remains largely

70

unknown.

71

Despite overlooked, the field of glycobiology can provide missing answers to

72

immunological questions. Glycosylation is a major post-translational mechanism

73

characterized by the enzymatic addition of glycans (carbohydrates) to proteins or lipids

74

of essentially all cells, including immune cells. In fact, glycans are master regulators of

75

immune cell functions, defining the activation and differentiation of T cells(11, 12). In

76

the cellular immune system, we and others have previously demonstrated the regulatory

77

power of glycans in adaptive immune response through the modulation of T cell

78

activation thresholds associated with the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases

79

and cancer(13–19). Moreover, being present in several pathogens, glycans can also be

80

sensed by immune cells, through their recognition by specific glycan-recognizing

81

receptors expressed in those cells(20). Like the majority of viruses, SARS-CoV-2 viral

82

capsids are also covered with glycans. More specifically, the spike protein of the SARS-

83

CoV-2 envelope was shown to be highly glycosylated (harboring 22 N-glycosylation

84

sites) with glycan structures such as oligomannose and some branched N-glycans(21,

85

22). These structures can be specifically recognized by glycan binding proteins (GBPs)

86

of host’s immune cells, such as the C-type-lectin Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular

87

adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN), present in innate immune

88

cells, promoting virus recognition and elimination(23, 24).

89

Defining the glycosylation profiles of immune cells in SARS-CoV-2 infected

90

individuals and how they impact their effector functions remains completely unknown,

91

being of utmost importance for the understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis,

92

as well as for the improvement of the clinical management of the disease and for

93

pandemic control measures, namely as a stratification biomarker.

94

In this study, we discovered that circulating T cells exhibit a glycan switch upon SARS-

95

CoV-2 infection that is detected at COVID-19 diagnosis. This change in the

96

glycosylation profile of T cells appears to be triggered by a serum inflammatory factor

97

present in infected patients. This specific T cell glycan switch is more pronounced in

98

asymptomatic patients, rather than in those who exhibit symptoms. Importantly from a

99

clinical standpoint, we also unveiled that COVID-19 patients with good prognosis

100

exhibit an upregulation of DC-SIGN expression in circulating monocytes.

Cohort description and patient’s selection criteria

104

The present study integrates a total of 32 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2

105

from 2 individual Portuguese cohorts (between May 2020 and July 2020), 20 patients

106

from Infectious Disease Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário do Porto

107

(CHUP), Porto, Portugal and 12 patients from Infectious Disease Department, Centro

108

Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho (CHVNG), Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal. The

109

total cohort includes patients of both genders and age between 22 and 89 years old. All

110

the samples were included in all the FACS analysis discussed.

111

Blood was collected and plasma and PBMCs were isolated at the time of

112

diagnosis and 14 days (n=6) after diagnosis. Similar analysis was conducted in a subset

113

of patients (n=2) that recovered.

114

The eligibility criteria for inclusion in this study were SARS-CoV-2 positive

115

patients asymptomatic or symptomatic with different levels of severity (mild, moderate

116

and severe). Asymptomatic patients (n=5) were defined as positive for the SARS-CoV-

117

2 PCR test, but no signs of diseases. The following criteria were used to stratify

118

symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients in terms of the disease severity and accordingly

119

with WHO guidelines (25); 1- MILD (n=18): individuals with no evidences of

120

pneumonia; 2- MODERATE (n=6): individuals without need of invasive mechanical

121

ventilation and without need of admission to hospital intensive care unit, but evidence

122

of pneumonia and need of supplemental oxygen; 3- SEVERE (n=1): individuals with

123

need of invasive mechanical ventilation and with need of admission to hospital

124

intensive care unit. Patients demographic and relevant clinical data are summarized in

plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area

180

under the curve (AUC). The cut-off that revealed the best balance between sensitivity

181

and specificity was selected for the subsequent statistical analysis. Sensitivity,

182

specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Univariate

183

binary logistic regression analysis was performed to test DC-SIGN levels and disease

184

progression (good: asymptomatic maintained asymptomatic and/or severity decreased at

185

least one category; poor: symptoms were not improved and/or escalate to a higher

186

severity). In logistic regression, model goodness-of-fit was assessed by the Hosmer-

Lemeshow statistic and test. Results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) for each

188

category as compared with a predefined reference category, and their respective 95%

189

confidence intervals (CIs). Odds ratios above one and below one are indicative,

190

respectively, of higher and lower odds of develop poor disease course as compared with

Results

196
197

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals display decreased β1,6-GlcNAc branched and
α2,6-sialic acid N-glycans on peripheral T cells at diagnosis.

198

Taking into consideration the fact that it is still unclear the underlying mechanisms that

199

explain a differential inter-individual clinical presentation of COVID-19 at diagnosis,

200

we herein characterized the glycosylation profile of T cells from patients’ peripheral

201

blood. A lectin-based flow cytometry of the T cell populations was performed to

202

evaluate glycosylation profiles. We started by analysing the levels of expression of

203

ß1,6-GlcNAc branched N-glycan structures, known to have a major impact on the

204

regulation of T cell activity and function(13, 16, 26), using the L-PHA lectin. Our

205

results demonstrated that, overall, T cells from infected (IF) subjects have a decrease in

206

branched N-glycan structures, particularly on CD8+ and γδ T cells, when compared to

207

non-infected (non-IF) ones (Figure 1A, top and bottom left panel). Moreover, T cells

208

from asymptomatic patients have lower levels of ß1,6-GlcNAc branched N-glycans, that

209

gradually tend to increase along disease severity (Figure 1A, right). Notably, CD8+ T

210

cells display a significant decrease in the levels of expression of complex branched N-

211

glycans in asymptomatic and mild disease patients, when compared to non-IF

212

individuals (Figure 1A, top).

213

Concerning 2,6-sialylation (recognized by the SNA lectin), already described to play a

214

role in the regulation of T cells immune response(27), our results demonstrate that

215

CD8+ T cells from IF patients display a significant decreased SNA binding, in

216

comparison with non-IF individuals (Figure 1B, top left). Consistently, asymptomatic

217

patients present the lowest levels of SNA binding compared to non-IF (Fig.1B, top

218

right). Even though the levels of SNA binding were shown to be associated with age

219

(Supplemental Figure 1E), there are no significant differences between the mean age

220

of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (Supplemental Table 1). Curiously, for

221

both glycans, the two COVID-19 convalescent patients seem to recover (or surpass) the

222

levels of expression of β1,6-GlcNAc branched and α2,6-sialic acid glycan structures in

223

all T cell subsets (Fig. 1A and B, right). These results showed that CD8+T cells from

224

asymptomatic patients display a defect in branched and sialylated N-glycans when

225

compared with non-IF.

226

The differences observed in the glycosylation profile of T cells across severity, were not

227

related to the abundance or activation of T cell populations, since CD3+, CD4+, CD8+

228

and γδ T cells showed similar frequencies as well as similar levels of PD1 and CD69

229

expression between the groups, with the exception of lowered CD3+ population and

230

increased CD69+ within CD8+ T cells, in the mild disease group (Supplemental Figure

231

1A, B and C).

232

In addition, and since glycosylation is a dynamic process that can change along with

233

disease status, we took advantage of a limited longitudinal follow-up analysis using a

234

single patient, representative of each severity group (asymptomatic, mild, moderate and

235

severe), which revealed that levels of expression of ß1,6-GlcNAc and 2,6-sialylation

236

are restored in patients that improved disease severity at day 14 post-diagnosis

237

(Supplemental Figure 1D).

238

No major differences were observed for other glycan structures such as fucosylation

239

(AAL binding) or mannosylation (GNA binding) in the different T cell subsets at

240

diagnosis (Supplemental Figure 1A and B).

241

These results showed that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals led to an en bloc decreased

242

expression of specific glycan structures such as ß1,6-GlcNAc branched N-glycans and

243

α2,6-sialic acid in T cells, predominately in CD8+ T cells and asymptomatic patients.

244

The absence of differences on high mannose structures (GNA binding) or fucose

245

residues on T cells (AAL binding), support the specificity of the glycan switch. In fact,

246

decreased levels of β1,6-branched N-glycans in T cells have been pointed out as a

247

mechanism of TCR threshold regulation, by hampering the TCR complex clustering and

248

lowering the necessary amount of antigen-recognition to signal a cellular response(28).

249

Moreover, surface α2,6-sialylation also regulates T cell immune response through

250

galectins binding modulation(29–31).

251

In order to further clarify the underlying mechanism that imposes the changes in the

252

glycosylation profile of circulating T cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have

253

performed an in vitro assay, in which PBMCs isolated from healthy individuals were

254

co-cultured with plasma from 4 patients from either each group: non-IF, asymptomatic

255

or moderate disease. Our results showed that T cells, upon co-culture with plasma from

256

asymptomatic patients displayed a significant decreased expression of β1,6-GlcNAc

257

branched N-glycans (Figure 2A) and α2,6-sialylation (Figure 2B), when compared to T

258

cells cultured with plasma from non-IF individuals and moderate disease patients. These

259

results suggest the existence a specific serum factor that in asymptomatic patients drives

260

a remarkable drop of complex branched and sialylated glycans structures on T cells. In

261

fact, it is known that asymptomatic patients display a differential serum composition of

262

cytokines and chemokines, when compared to symptomatic (32, 33). Moreover, T cell

263

glycosylation is known to be modulated by specific interleukins, namely IL-2 and IL-7

264

that regulate the transcription of specific Golgi glycosyltransferases(17, 25), which

265

renders the hypothesis that an extracellular factor could be mediating the T cells glycan

266

switch in a more efficient manner in asymptomatic than symptomatic patients.

267
268

Levels of DC-SIGN expression in circulating monocytes predict COVID-19 prognosis

269

To gain further insights in the viral-glycan recognition mechanism, we have

270

characterized the expression of specific GBPs expressed by innate immune cells that are

271

known to sense and recognize specific viral glycans, instructing an immune

272

response(34). Regarding the abundance of innate cells, we have observed an increase in

273

the frequency of dendritic cells (DCs) as well as monocytes (Mo) in asymptomatic

274

patients, when compared to Non-IF individuals, and no differences in terms of NK and

275

NK-T cells subsets (Supplemental Figure 1B). Regarding their activation state,

276

analysed by CD86 expression, only monocytes are shown to be activated in

277

asymptomatic and mild disease patients (Supplemental Figure 1C). This is in

278

accordance with previous findings(35).

279

Specifically, DC-SIGN, a C-type-lectin that recognizes mannose structures, is already

280

known to play a role in the SARS-COV-2 recognition(24), being expressed by

281

monocytes, immature DCs and macrophages. Our results showed that patients from the

282

asymptomatic group displayed higher levels of DC-SIGN expression in monocytes

283

compared moderate disease (Figure 3A), suggesting an increased capacity of

284

asymptomatic patients to sense and recognize the virus.

285

Taking into consideration the biological relevance of DC-SIGN expression in

286

monocytes as the first sensing mechanism upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and given the

287

heterogenous expression of DC-SIGN among infected individuals (at diagnosis),

288

clinical information in terms of disease progression (development of a poor versus good

290

prognosis at day 14 post-diagnosis, characterized in Supplementary Table 1).

291

Remarkably, the expression levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes were found to be able to

292

stratify patients at diagnosis in terms of their likelihood of developing a good versus a

293

poor disease prognosis with a specificity and sensitivity of 78.9% and 63.6%,

294

respectively (Figure 3B). The univariate analysis demonstrated that high levels of DC-

295

SIGN expression in monocytes at diagnosis increase the odds ratio (OD) associated

296

with the prediction of having a good prognosis, OD = 6.548 p-value = 0.011. In fact, the

297

recognition of the coronaviruses´ glycans by innate immune cells was demonstrated to

298

be mediated by DC-SIGN(23, 24). An increased expression of this C-type-lectin at the

299

initial days of infection suggests a more efficient viral recognition and subsequent

300

clearance, resulting in a good prognosis of the disease.

302

Discussion

303

Our results demonstrated for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 infection imposes a

304

glycosylation reprogramming of adaptive immune cells suggesting a specific glycan

305

switch of T cells that may define their ability to successfully deal with infection. We

306

identified a specific glycosylation signature of circulating T cells that is associated with

307

their activity and function, distinguishing infected patients from non-infected

308

individuals. Our results also suggest that the glycan switch imprinted in circulating T

309

cells could be mediated by a serum extracellular factor(s), occurring just after SARS-

310

CoV-2 infection (Supplemental Figure 2). In fact, previous evidences from others and

311

us demonstrated that the deficiency in branched N-glycan structures on T cells imposes

312

a hyper-reactive phenotype with decreased threshold of T cell activation and increased

313

T cell activity(13, 28). We herein propose that the immune response against SARS-

314

CoV-2 infection appears to be influenced by the glycosylation profile of circulating T

315

cells which defines their effective functions. In fact, a pronounced deficiency of

316

complex branched and sialylated glycans on CD8+ and γδ T cells were observed in

317

asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. This dynamic and plastic glycoimmune modulation

318

(“Glyco-Immune Alert” mechanism) may constitute a novel mechanism of host-

319

response, that contributes to further understand the immunological differences among

320

infected individuals(36).

321

Furthermore, we also showed another glycan-based mechanism of host response to

322

SARS-CoV-2 driven by the upregulation of the viral´s glycans recognizing receptor

323

DC-SIGN in monocytes, with prognostic application when detected at diagnosis.

324

This study unlocks the identification of a specific glycosignature of T cells as well as a

325

prognostic biomarker in COVID-19. Further studies are needed to explore the

326

mechanistic impact of the T cell glycan switch in infection and along disease course.

327

Moreover, it is fundamental to identify the critical serological factor(s) that instructs this

328

T cells glyco-reprogramming, as a potential new biomarker and therapeutic target. Our

329

study was conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 (March-July 2020) having a

330

limitation in terms of sample size, indicating the need to validate these promising

331

observations in larger and well-characterized multicentric cohorts as well as analysing

332

the impact of other SARS-CoV-2 variants in T cells glycan switch.

333

These new evidences in COVID-19 pave the way to the identification of a specific

334

blood glycosignature able to stratify patients at diagnosis according with their risk to

335

evolve to worsen disease. This will certainly contribute to improve vaccination strategy

336

and patients risk stratification, optimizing an effective allocation and management of

337

health care resources such as ventilators and intensive care facilities.

Fig.3 – DC-SIGN expression in peripheral monocytes as a predictor of good vs. poor

515

prognosis in COVID-19 patients. (A) Levels of DC-SIGN surface expression (MFI) in

516

monocytes (Mo). (B) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plotted for the DC-

517

SIGN expression levels in monocytes from COVID-19 patients. The distribution of DC-

518

SIGN levels are represented regarding the prognosis, Px, (day 14; good Px in green and

519

poor Px in grey) as well as the severity at diagnosis. Each dot represents one patient

520

N=24. Gating strategies for each population are included in Supplemental Figure 1A.
