ABSTRACT

Background: Acute clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are less frequent and
less severe in children than in adults. However, recent observations raised concerns about
potential post-viral severe inflammatory reactions in children infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: We describe an outbreak of cases of Kawasaki disease (KD) admitted between
April 27 and May 7, 2020, in the general paediatrics department of a university hospital in
Paris, France. All children prospectively underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing, and echocardiography. The number of
admissions for KD during the study period was compared to that observed since January 1,
2018, based on discharge codes, using Poisson regression.
Results: A total of 17 children were admitted for KD over an 11-day period, in contrast with a
mean of 1.0 case per 2-week period over 2018-2019 (Poisson incidence rate ratio: 13.2 [95%
confidence interval: 7.3-24.1], p <0.001). Their median age was 7.5 (range, 3.7-16.6) years,
and 59% of patients originated from sub-Saharan Africa or Caribbean islands. Eleven patients
presented with KD shock syndrome (KDSS) requiring intensive care support, and 12 had
myocarditis. All children had marked gastrointestinal symptoms at the early stage of illness
and high levels of inflammatory markers. Fourteen patients (82%) had evidence of recent
SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR 7/17, positive IgG antibody detection 14/16). All
patients received immunoglobulins and some received corticosteroids (5/17). The clinical
outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5
cases (29%) during hospitalisation.
Conclusions: The ongoing outbreak of KD in the Paris might be related to SARS-CoV2, and
shows an unusually high proportion of children with gastrointestinal involvement, KDSS and
African ancestry.

INTRODUCTION
In children and adolescents, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
infection is mostly responsible for mild respiratory symptoms, by contrast with severe forms
reported in adults.1 2 An association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and late
vasculitis manifestations has been increasingly suspected, especially in young asymptomatic
patients, which may be due to post-viral immunological reactions.3 4
Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common primary vasculitis in childhood, affecting
predominantly medium and small-sized arteries.5 KD annual incidence is the highest in Japan,
with more than 300 per 100 000 children < 4 years of age, compared to 25 per 100 000
children < 5 years of age in North America.6 7 One of the most severe complications of KD is
coronary artery aneurysm.7 KD shock syndrome (KDSS) is a rare form of KD, frequently
associated with myocarditis and requiring critical care support during the acute phase of
illness.8

9

Although the aetiology of KD remains unclear, a role of a viral trigger on some

genetically predisposed children has been hypothesised, as several viral respiratory agents
have been associated with KD,10 including seasonal coronavirus in some,11

12

but not all,

studies.13 14
Recently, nine cases of children with signs and symptoms consistent with KD and
laboratory evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in the United States and
England.15

16

These reports included eight cases with hyperinflammatory syndrome and

multiorgan involvement similar to what is seen in KDSS. Given the highly variable
prevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Europe, the possibility of an association
between KD and positive testing for SARS-CoV-2 needs confirmation. Here we report a
cluster of 17 patients with KD admitted to a Parisian university hospital’s paediatric
department that occurred between April 27 and May 7, 2020, and evaluate potential temporal
association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
We included all children (age ≤ 18 years at the time of admission) diagnosed with KD and
admitted in the department of general paediatrics and paediatric infectious diseases of Necker
Hospital for Sick Children in Paris, France between April 27 and May 7, 2020. This
university hospital serves as the regional reference centre for emerging infectious diseases in
children. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des
Personnes Ouest IV, n° DC-2017-2987). All parents provided written informed consent.
The medical files of all patients were reviewed by using a standardised study-specific
form to collect demographic and clinical data, laboratory test results, and imaging and
echocardiographic findings. For the purposes of this study, the diagnosis of KD was based on
the criteria of the American Heart Association for complete and incomplete KD,7 and the
criteria proposed by Kanegaye et al. were used for the diagnosis of KDSS.8 All patients
underwent nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (SARS-CoV2 R-GENE,
Argene, bioMerieux), blood sampling for IgG SARS-CoV2 antibodies (SARS-CoV2
immunoassay, Abbott Core Laboratory) and laboratory tests, including inflammatory and
cardiac markers. Standard cardiology workup included regular electrocardiograms and
echocardiograms. A coronary artery dilation was defined as a Z-score of coronary artery
diameter between 2 and <2.5 and aneurysm as a Z-score ≥ 2.5.7 Intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) resistance was defined as persistent or recrudescent fever at least 36 hours and <7 days
after completion of first IVIG infusion.7
We compared the number of admissions for KD during the study period to that
observed since January 1, 2018, based on discharge codes. We used Poisson regression to
assess the change in the incidence of KD during the peak period, compared to all other two6

week periods, after excluding the ongoing period (weeks 17-20, 2020). We described patients’
characteristics using medians and percentages. Differences between groups were assessed by
the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis involved use of SPSS v21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL).

RESULTS
Clinical features
A total of 17 children were admitted with a diagnosis of KD between April 27 and May 7,
2020. In comparison, the average number of children admitted in our department with a
diagnosis of KD over 2018-2019 was 1.0 per 2-week period, for a Poisson incidence rate ratio
of 13.2 (95% confidence interval: 7.3 to 24.1, p <0.001; Figure 1). Clinical features are
presented in Table 1. The male/female ratio was 0.7. The median age at presentation was 7.5
years (range, 3.7-16.6), 59% had at least one parent originating from sub-Saharan Africa or
Caribbean islands, and 12% from Asia. Patients had no relevant personal or familial history,
and 14/17 (82%) were under the 97th centile for body mass index. A diagnosis of complete
KD was made for 8 (47%) children, while the others had incomplete KD. Among principal
criteria for KD, polymorphous skin rash (76%) and bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection
(76%) were the most frequent. All patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, occurring early in
the course of illness before the onset of KD principal manifestations and consisting of acute
abdominal pain, often associated with vomiting and diarrhoea (94%). Three had peritoneal
effusion, with acute surgical abdomen in two cases. One of them underwent abdominal
surgery for suspected appendicitis, revealing aseptic peritonitis. Irritability was common
(65%), and 5 (29%) patients presented with headaches, confusion or meningeal irritation.
Three underwent lumbar puncture, which revealed cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis in one case.
Among other acute manifestations of KD, 8 (47%) patients had pericardial effusions, and 3

(18%) had pleural effusion. Myocarditis was diagnosed in 12 (71%) patients, with left
ventricular ejection fraction ranging between 10% and 57%. Two of them displayed
significant electrocardiographic changes (increased QT interval and occasional ventricular
arrhythmias or diffuse ST-segment elevation) not attributable to any QTc-prolonging drug.

Imaging and laboratory findings
Of the 13 patients who underwent chest imaging (X-ray or CT-scan), ground-glass opacities,
local patchy shadowing, and interstitial abnormalities were present in 5 patients (38%) (Table
2). Echocardiography detected coronary arteries abnormalities in 8 patients (47%) after a
median of 7.5 (range, 5-11) days of fever, which consisted of dilations for 5 patients (29%)
and increased coronary visibility in three patients. No coronary aneurysm was identified. All
patients had high inflammatory parameters, including leukocytosis with a predominance of
neutrophils, and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and serum
interleukin-6 (IL-6; Table 2). Anaemia was common with a median haemoglobin level
reaching 8.1 (range, 5.3-12.2) g/dL. All patients had hyponatraemia (<135 mmol/L), and
hypoalbuminaemia (<32 g/L) except one patient with mild KD. Transient kidney failure was
observed in 8 (47%) of patients. Moderate elevation in serum alanine transaminases (ALT)
and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) occurred in 53% and 76% of patients, respectively,
and GGT elevation occurred after several days of disease course. Lipase enzyme was elevated
in 7 out of the 12 patients tested. D-dimers were elevated (>500 ng/mL) in 15/16 patients
(94%). Elevated levels of troponin (>26 ng/mL) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, >100
pg/mL) were found in 13/17 (76%) and 11/17 (65%) patients, respectively.

As first-line treatment, all 17 patients received high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) after a median of 5
days of fever (range, 0-12) and low-dose aspirin (Table 3), and three patients received
concomitant corticosteroids (2 to 10 mg/kg/day). Five (29%) had IVIG resistance and were
treated with a second infusion of IVIG (2 g/kg), with the addition of corticosteroids (2
mg/kg/day) for three of these patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered to 14
patients (82%) until negative bacteriological results returned negative.
Thirteen patients (76%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for management
of haemodynamic instability. Eleven (65%) were considered as KDSS and received IV fluid
resuscitation, together with vasoactive agents in 7 of them. Eight patients received inotropic
agents in a context of myocarditis, and 9 needed respiratory support for management of
cardiovascular compromise. ICU patients had higher systemic inflammation parameters, with
a higher peak PCT level (52.4 ng/mL, range, 1.65-448) compared to non-ICU patients (1
ng/mL, range, 0.13-4.17; p = 0.002). Median ICU length of stay was 5.5 (range, 3-15) days.
By May 7, 2020, 14 patients were discharged home after 8 (5-17) days of hospitalisation.

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
In response to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, the French strategy of closing schools and the
lockdown started on March 17, 2020. Since then, the 17 children reported here did not leave
home for school, social gathering or travel, according to their parents. A recent history of
viral-like symptoms was reported in 6 children: cough, coryza, fever < 48 hours, and for one
patient, anosmia. The median duration between these preceding symptoms and onset of signs
and symptoms of KD was 42 days (range, 18-79). History of recent contact with family
members displaying viral-like symptoms was reported in 9 households: parents or
grandparents (n=10), and siblings (n=3). Five of these family contacts had high suspicion of
COVID-19 (ageusia, anosmia, suggestive findings on thoracic CT), of which one had a

positive RT-PCR. The median interval between the reported contact and KD was 36 (range,
24-38) days. RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 17 children presented here was positive
for 7 (41%) (Table 2). All but one of them had no symptoms suggestive of Covid-19; one had
anosmia that started 24 hours before KD symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were
detected in 14 out of 16 (88%) tested patients. The two negative patients also had negative
testing for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2. These two patients presented with mild KD, with 5 and 6
days of fever before diagnosis, 3 and 4 principal KD criteria, and no myocarditis. Their PCT
levels were < 1 ng/mL, and coronary dilatation was detected in one. Multiplex PCR targeting
human respiratory syncytial viruses, seasonal coronaviruses, parainfluenza and influenza
viruses, metapneumovirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus in nasopharyngeal swabs, was negative
in all patients tested (n=16); serum PCR for adenovirus, EBV, CMV, HHV6, and parvovirus
B19 were negative in the 9 tested children.

DISCUSSION
Interpretation
Compared to the two previous years, we found a 13-fold increased incidence in KD in
children hospitalised in the general paediatrics department of a large university hospital centre
in Paris. The temporal association with the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France and
the results of RT-PCR and IgG testing in our patients suggest a causal link. Furthermore, all
but one of our patients had no suggestive symptoms of acute Covid-19 disease and most had
positive serum IgG responses, suggesting that the development of KD in these patients is
more likely to be the result of a post-viral immunological reaction. Association between KD
and viral respiratory infections has been previously suspected,10

no difference in clinical presentation between infected and non-infected KD cases was
previously reported.10
In our series, we recorded an over-representation of incomplete KD (53%), which
might be explained by a high proportion of severe KD with myocarditis and KDSS, consistent
with previous findings.9 Mild myocarditis is very common in the early phase of KD as
demonstrated by cardiac biopsies and scintigraphy,18

19

and generally improves quickly as

inflammation resolves.18 20 However, more severe myocarditis with decreased left ventricular
contractility can sometimes occur, especially in the context of KDSS. KDSS is a rare
complication affecting 1.5 to 7% of KD patients with a higher incidence in Western countries
than in Asia.9 It appears to result from both myocardial dysfunction and decreased peripheral
vascular resistance, usually requiring IV fluid resuscitation together with inotropic and
vasoactive agent infusion in ICU.8 21 KDSS pathophysiology remains unclear. A high level of
circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the distributive component of
shock. Indeed, KDSS was previously found associated with high levels of IL-6, CRP and
PCT.9 In our series, we observed very high levels of PCT, 8-fold higher than those recently
reported in 27 KDSS patients.9 CRP and IL-6 levels were also high. This major proinflammatory state may reflect a particularly strong post-viral immunological reaction to
SARS-CoV-2 as compared with other viral agents. Of note, a cytokine storm syndrome with
elevated inflammatory markers such as IL-6 was described in adult COVID-19 patients,22 and
has been associated with fatality.23
Besides inflammatory markers, clinical and biological features of our patients were
often consistent with the diagnosis of KDSS. Indeed, older age, higher D-dimer, lower
haemoglobin and albumin levels and more severe hyponatremia were previously found
associated with KDSS.9 By contrast with the recent series of Riphagen et al,16 only 18% of
our patients were above the 75th percentile for weight, which does not support the hypothesis

of overweight as a risk factor for KD after SARS-CoV-2 infection. IVIG resistance and
coronary artery abnormalities were less frequent in our series than in previous studies.8

9

However, these results should be taken with caution as coronary artery abnormalities may
appear later during follow-up. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also unusually common,
affecting 100% of our patients. Miyake et al. reported intestinal pseudo-obstruction in only
2% of 310 patients.24 As previously described, other KD symptoms appeared in all cases after
the intestinal ones, which may have led to diagnostic and therapeutic delays in some
children.25 Suspected mechanisms involve intestinal ischemia, secondary to bowel vessel
vasculitis. Rapid resolution of symptoms in all patients after IVIG supports this hypothesis.
Pancreatitis, detected by elevated lipase level in 7 patients, may also reflect vasculitis.26
Hypoalbuminemia was severe and may partially be attributed to exudative enteropathy.
The observation of a higher rate of patients originating from sub-Saharan Africa and
the Caribbean islands is consistent with recent findings reported by Riphagen et al.,16
suggesting either adverse social and living conditions or genetic susceptibility. KD is rarely
reported in sub-Saharan Africa, but it may be more common than previously thought.27 In the
USA, a 2.5-fold higher incidence was reported in children of Asian than of European ancestry
with an intermediary 1.5-fold risk for children of African ancestry.28 Besides, African
Americans have been disproportionately hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, also suggesting an
increased susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.29

30

Therefore, African countries

where SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has spread may face a potentially large number of KD in
children, and IVIG supply shortages should be anticipated in such settings. The absence of
reported cases of KD associated with SARS-CoV2 infection in Asian countries where the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started, and where the incidence of KD is the highest, is quite
remarkable. Ethnic differences in the development of KDSS were previously reported, with a

lower incidence rate in Asia than in Western countries.8

9

This warrants future studies

investigating underlying genetic and immunologic mechanisms.
Our study has limitations; First, there is a potential recruitment bias that may have
contributed to the significant rise in the number of KD patients hospitalised in our paediatric
department. Our hospital is the referral centre for severe pediatric COVID-19 in the Paris
area. Second, the low number of patients precluded in-depth comparisons of phenotypes with
adequate statistical power.

Conclusions
Our study documents an outbreak of KD in the Paris area and its association with recent
SARS-CoV-2 infection. KD cases reported here have characteristics that differ from classic
KD: this present form seems to be much more frequent among children of African ancestry,
with predominant acute gastrointestinal manifestations, haemodynamic instability and
myocarditis. These clinical findings should prompt a high degree of vigilance among primary
care and emergency physicians, and preparedness in countries with a high proportion of
children of African ancestry, while facing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
