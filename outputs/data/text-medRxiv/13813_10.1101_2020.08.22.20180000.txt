ABSTRACT:
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to study affect of COVID 19 pandemic
on lifestyle of young adults and adolescent. METHOD: Online survey, was
conducted in about 1000 respondents in the age group of 13-25 years.
RESULTS: Questionnaire based survey showed mean sleeping duration
changing from 6.85hours to 8.17hours, average screen time becoming 5.12hours
from 3.5hours, 51.9% subjects experiencing increased stress levels, 76.4%
subjects experiencing increased food intake and 38.6% subjects had decreased
levels of physical activity as per self-monitoring. CONCLUSION: These
changes might have long lasting effect on their physical, mental and social
health and need counteractive measures to help young people lead a healthy
lifestyle during the epidemic and beyond.

KEYWORDS: COVID-19, Pandemic, Lockdown, Youth, Life Style.

INTRODUCTION:
COVID-19 pandemic began from Wuhan, China and spread like wildfire
across the globe. Total lockdown consequent to it taken for preventing spread
of COVID 19 resulted in changes in daily life schedule ,daily physical activity
level , changes in daily life schedule, daily physical activity level, mental
activity level, food intake level, sleep duration ; restricted physical activity,
unlimited screen time and circadian rhythm disturbance coupled with minimal
exposure to sunlight—the primary determinant of our circadian rhythm [1] and
erratic food patterns, have serious repercussions on our health and wellbeing ,
Even after lockdown is lifted ,life will not remain the same as seen in studies [2]
.The present study is an attempt to find out the effect of this pandemic led
lockdown on the lifestyle of younger population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was a questionnaire-based survey, created using Google Forms,
which was circulated by the investigators via various social media apps like –
WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. Ethical clearance was obtained

before the study. The questionnaire, was based on the Fantastic Lifestyle
Questionnaire [3], which was served as an online link. The snowball sampling
was used to circulate it widely across India. The online link opened with the
question of Informed Consent. The questionnaire included questions on
sociodemographic parameters followed by questions related to sleep, screen
time, stress level, food intake and physical activity levels. Based on the
responses, they were statistically analysed using descriptive analysis tests, to
find the impact of this lockdown on the lifestyle of adolescents and young
adults.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Indian subjects literate enough to understand
questionnaire and in the age group 13years to 25years included in the study.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects suffering from any chronic disease like
diabetes. Hypertension, Asthma, mental illness and other systemic diseases,
were not included in this study.

RESULT:
A total of 1065 subjects were enrolled and they gave their consent to participate
in the survey.
The mean  SD of age was reported as 19.918  3.5388 years. 19% subjects
were from rural background, whereas 81% were from urban background.
3.098% subjects were present in junior classes, i.e. below class Xth, 8.92% were
Xth pass, 13.521% were XIIth pass, 65.44% were undergraduates, 7.136% were
postgraduates and 1.784% had other educational qualifications.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF AVERAGE DURATION OF SLEEP BEFORE AND
AFTER LOCKDOWN

TABLE 1: This table illustrates the changes in sleep duration before lockdown and

IMPACT ON STRESS LEVEL:
FIG 1: This pie chart shows the changes in stress level of subjects as experienced by them,
compared to pre-lockdown conditions. (ORIGINAL)

48.1% subjects responded by saying that there had been a decrease in their
stress level (with 13% saying there had been a drastic decrease and 35.1%
answering mild decrease). But a majority of 51.9% said that they had
experienced an increase in their stress levels during this time (with 40.2%
having a mild increase and 11.7% having drastic increase).

23.6% subjects recorded a decrease in the quantity of their food intake, whereas
a vast majority of 76.4% subjects voted in the contrary.

The above table clearly shows that the level of physical activity has decreased
for greater number of subjects (38.6%) or it has remained the same, as seen in
37% subjects.
We also asked our subjects whether they have tried anything creative or have
learnt anything new during this time, to which 79.3% replied in the affirmative.

DISCUSSION:
Results of the present study show a clear increment in the sleeping duration in
majority of the subjects. This might be simply due to the fact that there is
increased availability of leisure time. Although the quality of this extra duration
of sleep remains to be seen.
The increase in screen time as observed in the study, which might be due to the
rapid surge in online classes by educational institutes, in an effort to cope up
with the back-log of classes due to this lockdown. Moreover, increased free time
for the youth has led to the increased time that they are spending over social

media apps and also increased rate of binge watching. The lockdown has also
increased smartphone usage with weekly/daily time spent per user on
smartphone increasing 13%/12% after 3 weeks of COVID-19 outbreak. Daily
time spent per user on video streaming platforms (VOD) increased in parallel to
smartphone usage. New apps and websites also clocked growth via smartphone.
[5]

The increase in stress level, which happened with the majority can be associated
to many cause like: first and foremost threat of infection from the dreadful virus
and the overload of negative news from various kinds of media sources which
has created a negative ambience all around; also there is the threat of losing
their near and dear ones. Secondly, unemployment and loss of family income
owing to the lockdown can also be a major cause of worry and stress. Also, for
the educated youth, the big question mark over their future prospects and
opportunities and lack of infrastructural advantages can also be a major stressor.
Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including
posttraumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included
infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate
information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested longlasting effects. [6] Our results were similar to those found by Robert Stanton,
Quyen G. To, SamanKhalesi et al. [7] A deeper analysis, also leads to revelation
of the fact that during this time due to the homeostatic and neuroendocrine
disbalance, due to disbalance in circadian rhythms and stress, there might be
increased release of the hormone Ghrelin. [8] And Ghrelin induces hunger
greatly. [9] The matter of concern is the fact that the coupled increase in food
intake and decrease in physical activity levels can have debilitating effects on
the overall health of a being—starting from weight gain and obesity and finally
leading to severe complications like Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and
other serious conditions. [10] Recognizing the adverse collateral effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is critical in avoiding depreciation of weight
control efforts among youths afflicted with excess adiposity. Depending on
duration, these untoward lockdown effects may have a lasting impact on a
child’s or adolescent’s adult adiposity level. [11] Increased screen-time coupled
with increasing stress levels and decreasing physical activity levels, can have
their due repercussions on their ophthalmic health like narrowed retinal micro
vascular structure [12] as well as leading to an array of other psychological ,
cognitive and physical disorders like obesity, sleep problems, depression and
anxiety, to name a few. [13]The study could be made more elaborative with a
larger sample size and a longer follow up for residual side effects of lock down.

CONCLUSION:
The above study showed changes in the various lifestyle indices in younger
population owing to the COVID 19 pandemic led lockdown. The increased
screen time and habits like binge watching could be countered by an
encouragement of co-curricular activities in the adolescent and young adults
.Indoor physical activity and outdoor activity with due precautions should be
encouraged by parents and educational institutes as a part of their online
education .The course of the pandemic is uncertain , and may last long . Young
generation should maintain a fixed sleep wake schedule ,healthy eating habits
and some degree of exercise regime while following the safety norms to prevent
the spread of contagion , only then can the youth emerge victorious and expand
their horizons even under the restrictions imposed by the corona virus.
