Abstract
What determines the success of a COVID-19 Test & Trace policy? We
use an SEIR agent-based model on a graph, with realistic epidemiological parameters. Simulating variations in certain parameters of
Testing & Tracing, we find that important determinants of successful
containment are: (i) the time from symptom onset until a patient is
self-isolated and tested, and (ii) the share of contacts of a positive
patient who are successfully traced. Comparatively less important
is (iii) the time of test analysis and contact tracing. When the share
of contacts successfully traced is higher, the Test & Trace Time rises
somewhat in importance. These results are robust to a wide range of
values for how infectious presymptomatic patients are, to the amount
of asymptomatic patients, to the network degree distribution and
to base epidemic growth rate. We also provide mathematical arguments for why these simulation results hold in more general settings.
Since real world Test & Trace systems and policies could affect all
three parameters, Symptom Onset to Test Time should be considered,
alongside test turnaround time and contact tracing coverage, as a key
determinant of Test & Trace success.

covid-19 test & trace success determinants: modeling on a network

Introduction and Model Specification
The strategy of Testing & Tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19
has been proposed in many countries and contexts.[7][11][14] But
which factors of Testing & Tracing should be emphasized, in order
to achieve the best results? We analyze three possible determinants
of contact tracing success, to determine their relative influence on
epidemic growth rate and successful containment.
We use the same model as our previous paper[19], a SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)[13] model for disease progression. We use an agent-based model, where each agent (person) is
represented as a node in a graph, and infection happens between
contacts, represented by graph edges. We also model testing and
self-isolation ("Quarantine"), and contact tracing of positives' graph
neighbors. In all configurations of the model, we calibrate the base
infection probability so that absent any intervention, the doubling
time of the number of infected is about 5 days. This sets a constant
benchmark when assessing different configurations, and simulates
some social distancing and hygiene measures, since without these
measures the observed doubling time is around 3 days.

single agent.

neighboring Susceptible nodes - those
who share an edge with them. Full animation at bit.ly/seir-graph-animation.

There are two main additions to the model presented previously:
asymptomatic patients, and non-instantaneous Testing & Tracing.

Asymptomatics
A certain share of patients are asymptomatic, independent of any
other attribute (number of contacts, who they were infected from,
etc.). They differ from symptomatic patients in two ways:
1. They are 50% as infectious as symptomatic patients, both in the
final incubation (Exposed) phase and in the Infected phase.

Figure 3: Contact tracing. Share of
Contacts Traced of the neighbors of a
node which tests positive are traced
and themselves self-isolated and tested.
In this illustration, 60% of the Infected
positive node’s contacts were traced (3
out of 5).

2. They are never tested based on symptoms, since they do not display symptoms. They can be tested through contact tracing, and if
tested before becoming Recovered they test positive.

Non-instantaneous Testing & Tracing
Test results and contact tracing are not instantaneous, but instead
take a certain amount time. See section Model mechanics below.

Model mechanics
We now describe more precisely the timeline of infection, symptoms,
testing, quarantine etc. in the model. References for the values of specific parameters, where not provided here, are given in our previous
paper[19]. We use the terms Quarantine, isolation and self-isolation
interchangeably - they are all equivalent in our model.
1. Agent is Susceptible.

Figure 5: Illustration of the different
time intervals in the context of disease
progression. Symptom Onset to Test
Time is the time from symptom onset
to self-isolation and test. Test & Trace
Time is the time from when the primary
patient is tested and isolated until its
contacts are tested and isolated. It is
also the time between when the contacts are tested to when their contacts
are isolated and tested. Not all contacts
are successfully traced, only a certain
fraction, Share of Contacts Traced.

2. Agent is infected by another agent. The agent becomes Exposed,
and begins its incubation phase (Gamma distributed, mean 5.1
days, std 4.4 days).
3. In the last 2 days of the incubation (Exposed) phase, it is infectious, but only 50% as much as in the Infected phase (see sensitivity analysis in presymptomatic infectiousness section).
4. Incubation ends. Agent becomes Infected, develops symptoms (for
asymptomatic agents, see below).
5. After Symptom Onset to Test Time days, if the agent has not yet
Recovered, it shows up to be tested. At this point it is Quarantined
for 14 days, and the clock starts on test analysis.1
Asymptomatic patients - 40% of agents are asymptomatic. They
have the exact same disease progression, except they are 50%

If it has already recovered before its
Symptom Onset to Test Time, it is not
tested due to symptoms.

as infectious as the symptomatic at each stage (see Caveats and
limitations section for discussion of these numbers). They also
never show up to be tested based on symptoms (but if they are
tested through contact tracing, come out positive).
6. After Test & Trace Time days, the test analysis is complete and
results are positive.2 At this point a certain fraction, Share of Contacts Traced, of the positive agent’s neighbors are traced, tested
and Quarantined immediately for 14 days. Therefore, we can think
of Test & Trace Time as the time between a symptomatic agent
being tested and their primary circle being Quarantined after a
positive result.
7. Contacts who tested positive seed a new contact tracing cycle.
8. An Infected agent Recovers after (on average, Exponentially distributed) 3.5 days. It stops being infectious and symptomatic. If an
agent is Recovered and has not yet been tested, it will not be tested
on account of symptoms (and if tested through contact tracing will
show up negative).
It is crucial that in our model isolation of a tested agent (either
symptomatic or traced) happens at the moment the test is performed,
not when results are back. If isolation happens only when the results
are back, it is roughly equivalent to effective parameters where the
test analysis time counts against both Symptom Onset to Test Time
and Test & Trace Time.
For more details about the model, see our previous paper[19] or the
open source code on GitHub.

Parameters of Test & Trace
We analyze three parameters of a Test & Trace policy to determine
their relative importance for containment. We formally define these
three parameters now.
Symptom Onset to Test Time- On average, how many days does it
take from symptom onset until an Infected individual shows up for a
test, at which point they are Quarantined even before test results are
back. This is used as the expectation of an Exponential distribution
sampled for each agent.
Test & Trace Time (Test to Contact Test Time) - The time from
the moment a primary patient is tested until its contacts (neighbors

We also make the simplifying assumption that while awaiting test results, an
agent is not tested again.

in the graph) are Quarantined and tested. This is a constant (not
distributed).
Share of Contacts Traced - The fraction of a positive’s neighbors
which are successfully traced. Equivalently, it is the probability that
each neighbor of a positive is traced. Successful tracing is sampled
independently for each neighbor of a known positive, with this probability. For example, 50% means (on average) half of neighbors are
traced.

Simulations
Configuration
We present simulation results. The parameters we vary in these simulations are our three analyzed parameters: Symptom Onset to Test
Time, Test & Trace Time, and Share of Contacts Traced. See the specific values used for each in Table 1 above. For each set of parameters, a full simulation of the epidemic progression on the graph is
performed. The simulation runs until 600 days have been simulated,
or until the epidemic is eradicated (no more Exposed or Infected
nodes). Several summary statistics are collected, most prominently
the fraction of the population which is ever infected, as our main
outcome measure. We perform 10 independent simulations and calculate our statistics on the average of the 10 time series obtained, so
each data point is the result of 10 simulations. The graph is a scalefree network of 100,000 nodes, with parameter gamma=0.2 (in our
previous notation[19]), corresponding to a power law degree distribution with exponent -6 and mean degree 20. Each simulation is
seeded with a uniformly random 0.25% of the population Infected or
Exposed.
These simulations were done with some social distancing, i.e.
parameters calibrated to produce a base doubling time, absent any
testing and quarantine, of about 5 days. We obtained qualitatively
similar results when calibrating to a doubling time of 3.1 days.

Since there is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of
asymptomatic patients, we performed a sensitivity analysis and obtained qualitatively similar results for 25% asymptomatic and for 0%
asymptomatic.
We also obtained similar results for a graph which is not scalefree, but rather with a constant degree. The sensitivity analysis
results are not shown here. The full raw data for these graphs is
freely available.[18]

Results
We start with an illustrative example. Figure 6 shows the trajectory
of the epidemic in 4 simulations. The simulations are all with Share
of Contacts Traced = 50%, but different values of Symptom Onset
to Test Time and Test & Trace Time, with their sum held roughly
constant. Conditional on this sum, a shorter Symptom Onset to Test
Time facilitates faster containment. The effect is large - the Share
of population eventually infected ranges from 9.6% to 0.9%. This
illustrates the greater importance of Symptom Onset to Test Time
over Test & Trace Time, comparing day for day.
In what follows we abstract from the specific trajectories, and use
only the share of population eventually infected as our outcome measure, so each trajectory such as the ones above will be represented by
a single data point.
Figure 7 displays results of several simulations. In all of these,
Share of Contacts Traced = 50%, whereas Symptom Onset to Test
Time and of Test & Trace Time are varied to show their effects. Each
point in this graph is a simulation result. The Y value is the fraction
of the population which is eventually infected until the simulation
ends. Lower values mean successful suppression. The X value is the
Test & Trace Time, in days. The different series (colors) are simulations with different values of Symptom Onset to Test Time - lower
numbers are quicker detection. “inf” stands for “infinity”, meaning
symptomatic agents are never detected. Indeed, when symptomatic
agents are never detected (brown line), the Test & Trace Time does
not affect the outcome, since no contact tracing takes place.
It can be observed that the vertical distance between the different
lines is much larger than the vertical distance between the left and
right ends of each line. This means changes in Symptom Onset to
Test Time are more influential than changes in Test & Trace Time.
Also note the scale is smaller - there is a big difference between 1 and
2 days in Symptom Onset to Test Time, whereas the X axis scale is
multiple days. Test & Trace Time still does matter, especially for the
right parameters (e.g. 1 day Symptom Onset to Test Time).

different time interval parameter
values. Plotting over time the (log-scale)
share of Exposed and Infected agents
in the population. Keeping the sum
Symptom Onset to Test Time + Test &
Trace Time roughly constant at about 3
days, a shorter Symptom Onset to Test
Time facilitates faster containment.

Symptom Onset to Test Time and
of Test & Trace Time. The vertical
distance between the different lines is
much larger than the vertical distance
between the left and right ends of each
line. This means changes in Symptom
Onset to Test Time are more influential
than changes in Test & Trace Time.

Figure 8 shows a different slice of the parameter space - we fix
Symptom Onset to Test Time to 3.33 days, and show the effects of
the Share of Contacts Traced (color) along with Test & Trace Time
(X axis). Y is still the Share of Population Infected. As expected,
when Share of Contacts Traced = 0, meaning no contacts are ever
traced (red line), Test & Trace Time does not affect the outcome. The
higher the share of traced neighbors (80% - brown, 100% - grey),
the more influential the Test & Trace Time is. This is because the
Test & Trace Time only affects the successfully traced contacts, so it
is more important when more contacts are traced. Similarly, when
Test & Trace Time is very long (8 days, right side of each line), the
Share of Contacts Traced has a smaller effect, since contact tracing is
much less effective when 8 days elapse from a positive test result to
tracing of contacts - 8 days is longer than most serial intervals so the
infection chain gains a longer and longer lead on the contact tracing,
and not the other way around.

7

Figure 8: Higher Share of Contacts
Traced (color) lines have a steeper slope,
meaning for them Test & Trace Time (X
axis) has a stronger effect.

Finally, Figure 9 shows another slice of the parameter space. We
fix Test & Trace Time to 2 days, and check the relative effects of
Symptom Onset to Test Time and Share of Contacts Traced. Again,
when no symptomatic agents are detected (Symptom Onset to Test
Time = infinity, brown line) the Share of Contacts Traced has no
effect. But for other values, both parameters affect the Share of Population Infected - the vertical distance between the lines is comparable
to the vertical distance between the right side and left side of each
line.
In summary, we find that Symptom Onset to Test Time and Share
of Contacts Traced are stronger determinants of successful containment than Test & Trace Time. For example, reducing Symptom Onset
to Test Time from 2 days to 1 day has a similar effect as increasing
the Share of Contacts Traced from 50% to 80%, and both are more
effective than reducing the Test & Trace Time from 4 days to 1 day.
When the Share of Contacts Traced is higher, Test & Trace Time rises
in importance. Results for the full parameter space are presented in
the first row of Figure 10.

Effects of presymptomatic infectiousness
We test whether greater infectiousness in the presymptomatic phase
affects the results. It has been suggested[17][3][9][16] that patients
are most infectious in the final days before developing symptoms,
and in fact that most transmission happens before symptom onset. To
simulate this, we try three different values of presymptomatic relative

Figure 9: The vertical distance between
the colored lines is comparable to the
vertical distance between the right side
and left side of each line. This means
both Share of Contacts Traced and
Symptom Onset to Test Time significantly affect the Share of Population
Infected.

infectiousness. The presymptomatic relative infectiousness is the ratio
between the rate at which an agent in its infectious presymptomatic
phase (final 2 days of incubation) infects its neighbors, and the rate
for that agent in its symptomatic phase. A value of 0.5, for example,
means that if each day in the symptomatic phase, an agent infects a
neighbor with probability p, then each in the presymptomatic phase
that agent infects that neighbor with probability 0.5p. This parameter
controls the balance between presymptomatic infections and symptomatic infections, with higher values meaning a higher share of total
infections comes from the presymptomatic phase. We simulate using
three values: 0.5 (the value used in results above), 1, and 1.65.3 For
each value we recalibrate the infection probability to produce a basic
doubling time (absent any intervention) of about 5 days.

Results are presented in Figure 10. Each panel is similar to 7
above, with Share of Contacts Traced fixed to a certain value, determined by the column, and with Symptom Onset to Test Time
(color) and Test & Trace Time (X axis) varying. The different rows
correspond to the different values of presymptomatic relative infectiousness, lower rows representing more presymptomatic infections.

Comparing the different rows, we see that increased presymptomatic infectiousness (lower rows) makes all Test & Trace efforts
more difficult, which is expected since in these settings serial intervals are shorter and come before the indicator for testing - symptom
onset. However, presymptomatic infectiousness does not to change
the relative importance of the main three parameters - Share of Contacts Traced (columns) and Symptom Onset to Test Time (colors)
still have a stronger effect than changes in Test & Trace Time (X axis
value).

Caveats and limitations
We note a few caveats and limitations of our model. Our model relies
on very few unknown free parameters and magic numbers, but in
return it is simplistic in many ways. We make a conscious choice
not to model parameters we cannot estimate, and bear the costs in
lacking representation, which is detailed here.
We model isolation of symptomatic agents and traced contacts
with perfect compliance immediately upon test time - in reality
compliance with isolation is probably higher once test results are
known to be positive.
There is considerable uncertainty about the epidemiological
parameters of asymptomatic patients - firstly their prevalence in
the patient population, but also relative infectiousness and disease
progression & duration. In our simulations, 40% of patients are
asymptomatic[6][5][8], and have 50% relative infectiousness (see
[15], and assumed by [1]). This does not contradict what we could
estimate from the literature on viral shedding[20], but is still highly
uncertain. Otherwise disease progression (incubation time etc.) are
the same as symptomatics. Our results are robust to the share of
asymptomatic patients being lower (25% or 0%, sensitivity analysis
not shown), which captures a similar parameter, since the boundary
between symptomatic and asymptomatic is gradual. Moreover, decreasing the infectiousness of asymptomatic patients to less than 50%
would only strengthen the results.
In our model, Test & Trace Time is assumed to be constant, not
randomly distributed. We don't think this is crucial, unless test times
are correlated with infectiousness (such as the degree of the node),
but it could affect the results.
We use the share of the population eventually infected as our main
outcome. In principle each parameter configuration results in one of
two regimes: either containment, in which case the share eventually
infected is proportional to the share initially infected, or mitigated
spread, in which case it is proportional to the population size. In

theory, the share eventually infected is an imperfect proxy for this,
and the order of our results could depend on the network size or
number of nodes initially infected. In practice, we observed that there
is a preserved monotonic order across numbers of initial infected,
so that the share eventually infected for a single number of initially
infected provides a good separation between the regimes, so we do
not detail it, but it is another reason not to take the absolute numbers
presented as precise estimates.
All the general caveats about the model, stated in the previous
paper[19], apply. For example, no modeling of false test results, an
arbitrary mean degree, no graph locality, etc. Other studies have used
more realistic and complex social networks[1][4] or an age structured
population[2] to model epidemic spread.

Mathematical Arguments
We provide theoretical reasons for why Symptom Onset to Test Time,
the time from symptom onset to test and self-isolation, might be
more important for reducing growth rate than Test & Trace Time. We
give several reasons.
1. Reducing a day from Symptom Onset to Test Time, or reducing a
day from the Test & Trace Time, each have the same effect on the
time in which 1st circle contacts are traced, tested and isolated - in
both cases it makes it exactly one day earlier.
2. Reducing Symptom Onset to Test Time also reduces the amount
of time the primary patient can infect, since they are isolated as
soon as they are tested, not when results are back - this is not affected by Test & Trace Time. In the time they are isolated, they do
not infect further. So it reduces the number of additional people
they infect, thereby reducing R.
3. In our model, reducing Symptom Onset to Test Time increases the
share of infected agents who are ever tested, since if agents recover
before their Symptom Onset to Test Time, they are not tested. This
gives contact tracing a better starting point - more infected agents
identified. If a patient is not tested, all contacts they infected must
be independently detected to break the chain.
4. Test & Trace Time only affects the traced contacts, and not the ones
who aren’t traced. The effect of Test & Trace Time is therefore multiplied by the Share of Contacts Traced. If only 50% of contacts are
traced, Test & Trace Time affects at most 50% of contacts and so
only 50% of the infection chains, reducing R by at most 50%.

Discussion
We have found that increasing the Share of Contacts Traced and
reducing Symptom Onset to Test Time are important determinants
of successful contact tracing. Increasing the Share of Contacts Traced
has garnered much attention[4], with proposals such as smartphone
apps[10]. Contact Tracing techniques and Exposure Notifications
technologies can help with all the factors we’ve examined: People
who know they were exposed to a verified carrier AND develop
symptoms, will get tested earlier, more contacts can be traced and
of course more people will get tested as a result of getting notified
about a possible exposure. We therefore focus here on the second
important attribute, Symptom Onset to Test Time.
How might Symptom Onset to Test Time be reduced in practice?
Several policies can be considered. The first one - mentioned above,
and practiced is several countries - is that self-isolation begin at the
time of test sample collection (or the time of being notified of exposure, for a traced contact), not at the time when test results are
back. Isolating patients only when test results are back is roughly
equivalent to including the test analysis time in both the effective
Symptom Onset to Test Time and the effective Test & Trace Time.
Symptomatic patients who are tested can be reminded or ordered
to self-isolate until test results come back. Another policy is public
service announcements to encourage self-isolation and testing at the
first sign of symptoms, thus encouraging a quicker response. A third
policy is reducing the effort and cost required to get tested, such as
via drive-in testing, home testing or guidance and support hotlines
(depending on test availability).
In order to track the current performance of efforts to reduce
the time from symptoms to self-isolation, that time interval must
be measured. It is possible to record the symptom onset time as
well as the time of self-isolation and test using self-reports by patients with symptoms at sample collection sites, or patients who
are contacted as part of contact tracing. For example, if a traced
contact has experienced symptoms for 2 days before being contacted and has not independently asked for a test so far, we know
their Symptom Onset to Test Time is greater than 2 days. With the
Kaplan-Meier estimator[12], we can use these data points to estimate
the distribution of the Symptom Onset to Test Time for either the entire population of traced individuals, or only the subset who end up
testing positive.
So far we have considered the effects of different policies, but not
the costs involved with them. We now make a few comments on cost

and feasibility.
Reducing Symptom Onset to Test Time might be easier than reducing the Test & Trace Time, since it involves one symptomatic
patient, and not multiple contacts. It is also easier since for the typical symptomatic patient to self-isolate does not require competing resources, unlike testing and tracing capacity which need to be
strengthened or diverted from other patients to speed up the Test &
Trace process.
However, there are factors which make it more difficult to reduce
Symptom Onset to Test Time. During an advanced containment
phase, the non-COVID symptomatics (due to the flu and other reasons) far outnumber the COVID symptomatics, so efforts have to
impact many people who have a very weak incentive to comply. In
addition, the Testing & Tracing apparatus is typically centrally controlled by the government, which makes it more amenable to tracking
and improvement, as opposed to symptomatic individuals who are
not in constant touch with any central agency and are much harder
to monitor.
To conclude, we feel that the Symptom Onset to Test Time has
been too absent from discussions about COVID-19 containment, and
was not prioritized highly enough in policy.
