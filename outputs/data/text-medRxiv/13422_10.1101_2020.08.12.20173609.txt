Abstract

66

Background

67

The health sector's effectiveness during a pandemic primarily depends on the availability,

68

knowledge, skills, perceptions, and motivations of frontline healthcare workers. In this study, we

69

aimed to investigate the contextual factors associated with the knowledge, perceptions, and the

70

willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.

71

Methods

72

A total of 1051 frontline health-workers from all seven Nepalese provinces were included in this

73

web-based cross-sectional study, which was conducted in May 2020. Using a 5-point Likert

74

scale questionnaire, we collected information on knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of

75

frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic

76

regression was applied to identify independent associations between predictors and outcome

77

variables.

78

Results

79

Of the 1051 frontline health-workers, 17.2% were found to have inadequate knowledge on

80

COVID-19, 63.6% reported unsatisfactory perceptions of government response, and 35.9%

81

showed an unwillingness to work during the pandemic. Health workers at local health facilities

82

(AOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) and those with chronic diseases were less likely to have

83

adequate knowledge of COVID-19. Nurses (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.38-3.18), health-workers

84

from Karnali Province (AOR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.52-4.53), and those who had adequate knowledge

85

of COVID-19 (AOR: 3.86; 95% CI: 2.51-6.16) were more likely to have satisfactory perception

86

towards government response to COVID-19. In addition, laboratory-workers, health workers

87

from Karnali province, and those with adequate knowledge (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.27-2.58)

88

were more likely to work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

89

Conclusions

90

We concluded that frontline healthcare workers have some gaps in knowledge-related to

91

COVID-19; about two-thirds of them had a negative perception of government response, and

92

nearly one-third of them were unwilling to work. These observations demonstrate that prompt

93

actions are required to improve health-worker knowledge of COVID-19, address negative

94

perceptions to government responses, and motivate them to provide healthcare services during

95

the pandemic.

Introduction

111

In December 2019, an outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei

112

Province of China[1], and subsequently, faced with an escalating number beyond China, the

113

World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic[2]. Based on available

114

evidence, the disease is transmitted between individuals via nasopharyngeal droplets or saliva.

115

Furthermore, no vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19 is currently available[3]. Nepal is

116

a small country in South Asia that shares a border with China and observed its first case of

117

COVID-19 on January 25, 2020 [4]. In the first half of May 2020, Nepal experienced an

118

explosive increase in cases; more than three-fourths of all cases recorded do date occurred during

119

this period. As of May 24, 2020, Nepal reported 603 cases and three fatalities [5]. To tackle the

120

COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal first sealed its border with China, and then suspended all

121

international flights and, on March 23, implemented a country-wide comprehensive lock-down.

122

On April 3, after encountering its first case of local transmission, Nepal began to utilize its

123

resources more systematically [6].

124

125

Concern has been expressed that health systems in low-income countries like Nepal are not

126

sufficiently resilient to tackle a crisis like that presented by COVID-19. Due to resource

127

constraints and a weak health system structure, rapid diagnosis of suspected cases and contact

128

tracing are challenging[6]. Studies have shown that knowledge of infectious diseases is greatest

129

among doctors and nurses[7,8]. In addition, age, sex, educational status, and preexisting medical

130

conditions have been shown to affect health worker (HW) knowledge of Middle East Respiratory

131

Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)[9,10]. The primary

132

sources of information about COVID 19 are international health organizations such as the Center

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173609; this version posted August 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

133

for Disease Control (CDC), WHO and Ministry of Health, and social media. Moreover, the

134

effectiveness of healthcare sectors during public health emergencies primarily depends on the

135

availability, motivation and skills of frontline healthcare workers, and thus knowledge, their

136

perceived willingness to work during uncertain times is essential [11], because appropriate

137

perceptions and willingness to work during a pandemic are prerequisites of HW motivation to

138

provide necessary treatment and to take the preventive actions required to reduce pandemic’s

139

impact. Studies have shown that factors such are perceived personal risks, availability of

140

personal protective equipment, family care obligations, HW gender, type of employment,

141

personal confidence, defined role, dissemination of timely information, appropriate training, and

142

personal health problems, influence perceptions and willingness to work during pandemics [11–

143

14]. In the present study, frontline Healthcare Workers were defined as doctors, nurses,

144

paramedics, laboratory workers, pharmacists, pathologist, technical personnel, public health

145

workers, and others directly involved in COVID-19 prevention and treatment that have direct

146

contact with confirmed or suspected cases during patient intake, screening, inspection, testing,

147

transport, treatment, nursing, specimen collection, or pathogen detection.

148

To provide healthcare services effectively, it is essential to assess and update HW' knowledge

149

and improve motivation, and willingness, which depends on various factors at the individual, and

150

to system levels. The present study describes the actual HW scenarios factors associated with

151

their knowledge of COVID-19, their reactions to government interventions, and, most

152

importantly, their perceived willingness to work during the pandemic. This study also provides

153

valuable and actionable information to Nepal's policymakers to allow the judicious allocation of

154

scarce resources in the short run. In the long term, this study guides for those developing policies

155

and programs. That might be instrumental in ensuring preparedness to meet the challenges posed

156

by similar crises. Given this background, we aimed to investigate the contextual factors

157

associated with the perceptions and willingness to work among Nepalese front-line healthcare

158

workers during the COVID-19 pandemic to improve the prevention and management of future

159

similar outbreaks.

160

161

Methods

162

Study participants and Sampling

163

We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire from May 2020, among

164

HWs in Nepal in accord with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet Surveys

165

(CHERRIES) [15]. All participating HWs were aged 18 to 60 years old and ranged from high-

166

level officials of the Ministry of Health and Population to paramedics working at the grassroots

167

level in all seven provinces on Nepal. The research questionnaire was distributed to HWs using

168

the health workers' network. As an initial step, we first appointed a doctor or public health

169

professional in each of the seven provinces to act as a coordinator and co-investigator in the

170

team. These seven coordinators then sent HWs known to them a link to our questionnaire and

171

asked that these individuals send a Google link to other HWs they knew. Fischer's arctanh

172

transformation as a power of 90% and a minimum correlation of 0.1[16], showed that the

173

minimum sample size required was n=1046.

174

Survey Instrument and data collection

175

The online questionnaire included 33 questions on socioeconomic characteristics, HWs'

176

knowledge of COVID-19, perception toward government response toCOVID-19, and perceived

177

willingness to work during the pandemic. The Responses were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale

178

("Strongly Agree," "Agree," "Neutral," "Disagree" to "Strongly Disagree").

179

180

The socio-demographic characteristics investigated included age, gender, ethnicity, and marital

181

status. This section of the questionnaire also included questions about chronic diseases of HWs,

182

their caretaking responsibilities for dependent family members, nature of the employment, and

183

type of health facility at which they worked. Knowledge of COVID-19 was rated as "adequate"

184

and "inadequate," perception of government response as "satisfactory" and "unsatisfactory" and

185

willingness to work as "willing" and "unwilling." Knowledge of COVID-19 was assessed based

186

on knowledge of the causative agent, mode of transmission, proper use of PPE, infection

187

prevention measures, and public health impact of the pandemic. Reaction to government

188

response was determined by assessing response effectiveness, timeliness of information

189

provided, provision of supplies, support received from administrative staff, and elected

190

representatives. Factors influencing willingness to work during the pandemic were risk of self

191

infection, healthcare service rationing, the requirement to work overtime, working with untrained

192

HWs, deployment to another duty station, family risk, and ability to choose whether to work or

193

not during the pandemic.

194

195

The questionnaire was prepared based on national COVID-19 guidelines issued by the Ministry

196

of Health and Population of Nepal[17] and World Health Organization resource center guidelines

197

for HWs on COVID-19 [18]. A team of medical doctors, public health workers, and an academic

198

assessed the questionnaire for validity and relevance. Before conducting the survey, we

199

conducted a pilot study on 30 participants to assess the reliability of the questionnaire items. The

200

analysis revealed an overall Cronbach's alpha score of 0.77, indicating higher internal

201

consistency[19]. The questionnaire was prepared as a Google Form, and Facebook Messenger

202

was used to sending the Google form link to participants [20,21]. The questionnaire took

203

approximately 10 minutes to complete. To maintain data confidentiality, only two research team

204

members had access to the data repository, stored on a password-protected computer.

205

206

Data Management and Statistical Analysis

207

The data collected was downloaded in the form of a spreadsheet and checked for duplications

208

and technical errors. After confirming the completeness, we exported the data to R Studio

209

Software for full analysis [22]. Socio-demographic characteristics were subjected to descriptive

210

analysis using the table 1package in R software, and results are presented as frequencies,

211

percentages, or as means and standard deviations [23].

212

213

Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with adequate

214

knowledge, satisfaction with the government response, and willingness to work using

215

the finalfit package in R [24]. Parsimonious multivariate models were created for each dependent

216

variable and included independent variables found to be significant (p-value <0.05) by univariate

217

analysis. Coefficients in the regression models were transformed into odds ratios with 95 %

218

confidence intervals. P-values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Ethics statement

222

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Nepal Health Research Council (approval

223

no: 329/2020 P). The first page of the questionnaire detailed the study objective, benefits, and

224

harm. HWs provided e-consent prior to participating in the study. Participants were informed

225

that they could leave the study at any time. Participation was voluntary and anonymous.

227

Results

228

Socio-demographic characteristics

229

A total of 1051 HWs participated in the study, 725 (68%) men and 326 (31%) women. The

230

response rate was 79%. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of health care

231

workers who participated in the study. Nearly 49% of the participants were aged between 20 to

232

30 years. More than half (57.4%) of the HWs were Brahmin or Chhetri. The majority of the

233

participants were doctors (35.3 %) and nurses or midwives (16.5%). Highest percentage response

234

was from Bagmati Province (19.4%), which contains the capital city Kathmandu. Detailed

235

information about the provinces of Nepal is explained in Additional File. Nearly 60% of HWs

236

were permanent employees. More than 25% worked in local-level public health facilities, such as

237

health posts, primary health care centers, community health units, and urban health centers. More

238

than 50% worked in hospitals, public hospitals (22.8%) followed by teaching hospitals and

239

private hospitals. Nearly 20% of respondents used a health-related managerial agency at the

240

federal, provincial, or local levels. 13.5% of HWs reported having a chronic disease; the most

241

common of which were diabetes, heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease and 64% of HWs

242

had family members of less than five years or more than 60 years who needed their care and

243

support. [Please insert Table 1 here].

244

245

Health Worker’ Knowledge of COVID-19

246

More than 80% of HWs had adequate knowledge of COVID-19 (See Table 2), and the

247

percentage of men with adequate knowledge was higher than that of women. No significant

248

difference in knowledge was observed among ethnic groups. However, significant differences

249

were observed among health professionals. More than 90% of public health workers had

250

adequate knowledge, while only 61.5% of other health workers such as Ayurveda—an ancient

251

medical system prevalent in Nepal [25] and pharmacists had adequate knowledge. No provincial

252

differences in COVID-19 knowledge were observed. However, knowledge of COVID-10

253

differed among HWs employed at different health facility types. No difference in COVID-19

254

related knowledge was found between those with or without chronic diseases or caretaking

255

responsibilities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, professional

256

category, and type of healthcare facility were associated with adequate knowledge of COVID-19,

257

as shown in Table 2. Males were more likely to have adequate knowledge (OR: 1.60; 95 % CI:

258

1.02-2.47) than females. HWs in“other” professional categories such as pharmacists, and

259

Ayurveda—had less adequate knowledge than doctors (OR: 0.33; 95 % CI: 0.14-0.80). HWs

260

working at local health facilities were more likely to have inadequate knowledge about COVID-

264

Health Workers’ reactions to government response to COVID-19

265

Pandemic

266

More than 60% of HWs considered government response to COVID-19 Pandemic was

267

unsatisfactory (Table 3). Gender and ethnicity were not found to influence perceptions of

268

government response significantly. Nearly 74% of doctors reported government response to be

269

unsatisfactory, while only 43 % of public health workers thought so. About 72 % of HWs from

270

Bagmati Province and Province 2 were dissatisfied with the government response. Chronic

271

disease and caretaking responsibility did not influence reactions to government response.

272

273

Multivariate logistic regression showed the reactions of HWs to government response were

274

associated with a professional category, province, type of health facility, and adequacy of

275

knowledge about COVID-19 (Table 3). Nurses were more likely to consider government

276

response satisfactory than doctors (OR: 2.10; 95 % CI: 1.38-3.18). Similarly, public health

277

professionals were more likely to consider government response to COVID-19 was satisfactory

278

than doctors (OR: 1.83; CI 1.07 – 3.11). HWs from Province 6 (OR:2.62; 95 % CI: 1.52-4.53)

279

and Province 7 (OR: 1.72; CI: 1.06-2.80) were more likely to consider government response

280

satisfactory than those from Bagmati Province. Those working in public and teaching hospitals

281

and local public health facilities were less likely to consider government response satisfactory

282

than HW working from federal and provincial-level agencies. Interestingly, HWs with adequate

285

286

Health workers’ willingness to work during the COVID-19

287

Pandemic

288

About 64 % of HWs reported a willingness to work under the challenging conditions created

289

during the COVID-19 Pandemic (Table 4). No significant difference was observed between men

290

and women with respect to willingness to work. About 74 % of laboratory workers were willing

291

to work whereas, only 48.5 % of doctors were willing to do so. Furthermore, differences were

292

observed between the seven provinces; ~85 % of HWs in Karnali Province, but only 54.5 % of

293

HWs from Province 2 were willing to work.

294

295

Multivariate analysis showed a willingness to work was associated with the professional

296

category, province, presence of chronic disease, caregiving responsibility, and knowledge of

297

COVID-19. Laboratory staffs (OR: 3.54; 95 % CI: 1.77-7.61), paramedics (OR: 2.52; 95 % CI:

298

1.79 – 3.58), public health workers (OR: 2.40; 95 % CI: 1.47-4.01), and nurses/midwives (OR:

299

2.09; 95 % CI: 1.40-3.47), were more willing to work during the pandemic than doctors. HWs

300

from Karnali Province (OR: 2.96; 95 % CI: 1.62-5.64), and Sudurpaschim Province (OR: 2.10;

301

95 % CI: 1.28- 3.48) were more likely to report willingness to work than those from Bagmati

302

Province. HWs with responsibility for dependent family members were less willing to work than

303

those without these responsibilities (OR: 0.72; 0.54-0.95). Finally, the HWs with adequate

This is the first nationwide study on knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among frontline

309

healthcare workers and their willingness to work during the pandemic in Nepal. About two in ten

310

frontline healthcare workers (17.2%) had inadequate knowledge of COVID-19, which is higher

311

than that reported in a Chinese study, in which ~ 11 % demonstrated insufficient knowledge[26].

312

On the other hand, a study conducted by Bhagavathula S.A et al. reported that 61% of health

313

workers had poor knowledge about COVID-19 transmission [27]. These differences between

314

rates may have been due to variations in the level of knowledge accessed. Furthermore, the latter

315

study was conducted in the first week of March 2020, and the Chinese study was conducted in

316

the third week of May, when more information regarding COVID 19 was available and

317

disseminated through different media. Knowledge is crucial for establishing perception and

318

preventive behavior, which both affect coping interventions to some degree [28].

319

In addition, we found nearly two-thirds healthcare works (63.6%) believed government response

320

to COVID-19 was unsatisfactory. A slightly higher level of satisfaction with government

321

response was reported in a survey conducted on the Nepalese general public in April 2020 (71.4

322

%) [29]. The present stud also showed that most HWs (86%) experienced logistical shortcomings

323

and reported inadequate supports form administrative (60%) and elected representatives (67.5%),

324

which concurs with findings of a previous study[30]. Furthermore, our study shows that more

325

than one in three HW (35.8%) were unwilling to work during the pandemic, which is

326

considerable issues because the health system's workload during the pandemic will be so high

327

that all available health resources will be required to combat emergencies. In addition, the rate

328

observed were higher than those reported in several other studies on willingness to work among

329

health workers during public health emergencies[12–14,31,32]. In the present study, these high

330

rates may have been due to inadequate knowledge (17%), preexisting chronic disease (13.5%),

331

shortage of PPE (86%) and other factors [32,33]. The high rates of unwillingness to work during

332

the pandemic revealed by our study demand the additional efforts be made to rectify the

333

situation.

334

We also found that male health workers were more likely to report adequate knowledge; which is

335

consistent with that found in another study conducted in Nepalese [34]. This finding may be due

336

to greater interaction and socialization by men, and gendered norms, which means men are more

337

likely to overestimate, and women are likely to underestimate personal knowledge [35–38]. The

338

study also showed that pharmacists and Ayurveda had inadequate knowledge of COVID-19 rates

339

as compared with doctors; finding is similar to a survey conducted in Nepal [34]. We also found

340

that HWs in the local health facilities were less likely to have adequate knowledge than the HWs

341

in federal or provincial agencies, which was possibly due to weaker implementation of COVID-

342

19 related governmental interventions at the local level than that at provincial or federal levels.

343

In addition, HWs with a chronic disease considered they had inadequate knowledge of COVID-

344

19, perhaps because time limitations imposed by pre-existing conditions restricted studies about

345

COVID-19.

346

This study shows that the professional category, province, type of health facility, and knowledge

347

of COVID-19 were significantly associated with frontline health workers' satisfaction with

348

government response to the pandemic. Nurses were found to be more likely to be satisfied with

349

government response than counterpart frontline doctors. This perception difference might have

350

been due to the differences between levels of technical knowledge among doctors, nurses, and

351

public health workers. Furthermore, health workers from Karnali and Sudurpaschim Provinces

352

were more likely to be satisfied with government response than HWs from Bagmati province.

353

However, the reasons responsible for these provincial variations were not determined. In

354

addition, HWs from local public health facilities, teaching hospitals, and private hospitals had

355

unsatisfactory perceptions than managerial level HWs at the ministry level, which we attribute to

356

different work experiences, as HWs at health service outlets are directly exposed to risks and

357

better understand the risks posed by logistical shortfalls than managerial level HWs.

358

Interestingly, HWs with adequate knowledge of COVID-19 were more satisfied with

359

government response than HWs with inadequate knowledge.

360

Interestingly, health workers professional category, province, presence of chronic disease,

361

dependent family members, and knowledge about COVID 19 were associated with a willingness

362

to work during the pandemic, and nurses, paramedics, public health workers, and laboratory staff

363

were more willing to work than clinicians, which contradicts the results of a systematic review

364

conducted by Aoyagi et al. [39]. HWs from Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces were more

365

willing to work than counterparts from Bagmati province. Similarly, it might be possible that due

366

to virtually no cases of COVID-19 during the study, the HWs were willing to work in a humane

367

way. Furthermore, HWs with adequate knowledge about COVID-19 were more willing to work,

368

which concurs with a study performed on the 2007 influenza pandemic [40]. Our result shows

369

that HWs with a chronic disease[41] and those that cared for family members[40] were less

370

willing to work, which is also in line with previous studies [12,39]. It may be caring for family

371

members and that coping with personal chronic health problems diminishes willingness to work

372

[41].

373

This study was conducted to identify predictors of the willingness of frontline healthcare workers

374

to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform

375

various stakeholders and policymakers involved in the drafting of future interventions to improve

376

the effectiveness of the health sector during public health crises. However, despite our efforts,

377

this study has several limitations. First, data was obtained using a questionnaire over the web and

378

health care workers were recruited using their personal networks. Therefore, our results should

379

not be extended to healthcare workers that do not use the internet. Second, the data used was

380

self-reported, which makes the study prone to desirability bias and inaccuracies. Furthermore,

381

participants were asked to consider their willingness to work under hypothetical conditions that

382

did not exist when Nepal comparatively observed a lower number of cases and fatalities. We

383

recommend studies of the impacts of HW knowledge, perception, and willingness to work on

384

health sector efficiency in the context of public health emergencies be undertaken.

385

386

Conclusions

387

Health workers play an extremely critical role in the battle against pandemics. Therefore, their

388

knowledge about the disease and their willingness to work are crucially required to prevent

389

disease transmission and reduce morbidity and mortality. In view of the perceived knowledge

390

gap of health workers about COVID-19, adequate training provides a means of addressing this

391

shortcoming. The high-level dissatisfaction of HWs with logistical issues and shortages should

392

also be at the focus of efforts to improving perceptions of government response. Health

393

managers should be fully aware of the impacts of factors and devise comprehensive approaches

394

that ensure the safety of HWs and promote coordination to motivate the HWs to work efficiently

395

and effectively in a sustainable manner throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
