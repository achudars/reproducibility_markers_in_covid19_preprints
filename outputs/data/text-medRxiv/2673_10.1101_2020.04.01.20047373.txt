ABSTRACT:

34

Introduction:

35
36
37
38

The novel coronavirus epidemic which originated in late 2019 from China has wreaked havoc on
millions across the world with illness, death and socioeconomic recession. As of now no valid
treatment or preventative strategy has evolved worldwide and governments across the world have
been forced to take the draconian step of social isolation in communities by enforcing “lockdowns”.

Aim of this Study:

40
41
42
43
44

This study aims to correlate the rates of infection with the novel coronavirus and total deaths as the
primary output variable. In addition the strength of association between infection rates and total
death in comparison to GDP share of the respective countries, physicians, hospital beds and rates of
testing for COVID 19 infection per thousand patients, is being assessed, in a bid to develop a model
which would help to develop tools to reduce the impact of this disease.

51
52

Data relating to number of cases, severity, cases recovered and deaths worldwide and specifically for
the top six countries affected was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being
updated on a daily basis till 22nd March 2020, the date of analysis. Additional data related to GDP,
physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database. All data
were collected in a file in CSV format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2
software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel. The analytical strategy was descriptive
with no inferential overtones.

COVID 19 infection strongly correlates with total deaths (r : 0.89), with a predicted death rate of 25
patients per 1000 affected. There was no correlation between the GDP growth of the country and
number of treating physicians/1000 patient population with any COVID 19 related outcome.
However there was a negative correlation between COVID 19-related deaths and the number of
beds available per 1000 population [r=-0.34]. Importantly there is an inverse correlation between
the number of tests conducted per million population with the rates of active infections [r=-0.12] ,
new cases [r=-0.38] and new deaths [r=-0.28] in COVID 19.

61

Conclusion:

62
63
64
65

This is the first study to assess parameters other than age and sex and sets out a robust dataset
which indicates an increased risk of worsening outcomes with lesser number of beds and testing,
suggesting that the need of the hour is to increase available bed numbers and to increase rates of
testing.

81

The outbreak of coronavirus pandemic which started from late 2019 has created a havoc on human
civilization. We are not only faced with the disease-related morbidity and mortality, but also
extensive economic, social and psychological upheaval. In view of the rapidity of spread of infection
and a high mortality rate the present day health-care system is firmly focussed on both prevention
and treatment. Research required to arrive at a definitive therapeutic intervention is going to take
some time, but there are encouraging reports from non-randomised trials with drugs like
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, azithromycin.[1,2] Governments across the globe have
taken on this calamity of herculean proportions head on with lockdown of cities in an attempt to
contain further spread of the disease.

82
83
84
85

However, it is also extremely important to analyse the evolving data at hand to get an understanding
of the direction we are headed. Such an analysis might also help us prepare more effectively to plan
for the future and fortify preventive strategies giving researchers ample space and time to come up
with potent and effective cure for COVID-19 pneumonia.

86

2. Aims of this analysis:

87
88
89
90
91

This analysis aims at finding a correlation between the rates of infection and total death. In addition
we also looked at the strength of association between infection rates and death in comparison to
GDP share of the respective countries, physicians & hospital beds/1000 patients and rates of testing
for COVID 19 infection per 1 million patients. Lastly, we plan to create a regression model which
would help predicting the death rates in those infected with COVID-19.

92

3. Materials & Methods:

93
94
95
96
97
98

We collected the data from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being updated on a daily
basis.[3] Since we needed to do the analysis at a point in time we selected the data available as of
22nd March as the date of analysis. Since data relating to age and sex and their correlation to COVID
19 outcomes have already been published, those data were not collated [4]. Additional data related
to GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database.
[5,6,7]

99
100

All data were collected in a file in CSV file format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with
Python 3.8.2 software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel.

101

The analytical strategy was descriptive with no inferential overtones.

102

4. Results:

103

4.1 Patients infected with COVID-19 and mortality:

104
105
106

A very strong correlation (r: 0.89) was found between the patients infected with COVID-19 and total
death. (Fig 1) There was a 89% association between death and getting infected (P<0.001, 95% CI:
0.046-0.056).

107

For every 1000 patient the predictive death count was 25.

108
109

The regression model for prediction was: y(total number of death from COVID-19) = -26.72 +
0.05*total infected population. (Fig 2)

4.2 Relationship between GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patient population and
infection rate & mortality:

113
114
115

There was poor correlation between GDP growth and infection rate [r=0.04] or death from COVID-19
[r=0.01]. As a matter of fact the top 5 infected countries bearing most of the brunt from COVID-19
infection shares 48% of the Global GDP between them. (Table 1)

116
117
118
119
120
121
122

In view of the wide heterogeneity of data entry across the different countries including most of the
input parameters there were no correlation trend visible as far as infection rates and its relationship
with the physicians or hospital bed per 1000 patient population was concerned. (Fig 3) However,
analysing the top 15 infected countries gave a definitive trend. (Fig 3) New deaths from COVID 19
was inversely correlated with the number of available hospital beds per 1000 infected patients
admitted [r=-0.34]. However, there was no trend observed between the COVID-19 related deaths
and physicians per 1000 population[.r=-.011 ] . (Fig 3)

123
124

Amongst the top 6 infected countries Germany had the best physician and hospital bed per 1000
patient population.

125
126

4.3 Correlation between testing for COVID-19 and other variables:

127
128
129
130

In view of increased frequency of testing seen predominantly in the top 15 countries, analysis was
done on the same to improve the yield of outcomes. Increased testing frequency was associated
with a positive correlation with recovery [r=0.18 ] and was negatively correlated with new cases, [r=0.38] new deaths, [r=-0.28] active cases [r=-0.12 ]. (Fig 3)

131
132

5. Discussion:

133

143

The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 have crossed 3 lakhs with more than 12,000 deaths
at the time of this analysis. The figures keep climbing up steeply with each passing days. It is a crisis
of mammoth proportion requiring the cooperation from the individual to the global leaders in health
and politics. The situation came into focus when 44 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were
reported from the Wuhan province of China. [8] It was the beginning of the second week of January
when a novel strain of coronavirus was found to be responsible. Thereafter there has been a steep
rise in cases not only in the Hubei province but different regions of China and adjoining countries like
Thailand. With increasing spread of the disease and the associated number of deaths, different
countries started to react in an attempt to prevent the disease. The approaches included case
finding, isolation of suspected cases and their close contacts and also hunting for active therapeutic
agents to tackle the viral-related morbidity and mortality.

144
145
146
147
148
149
150

Recent genomic studies have practically ruled out the possibility of a laboratory related experiment
gone out of hand. [9] The two hypothesis doing rounds are a non-pathogenic strain of coronavirus
which jumped into a human host from an animal intermediary and became pathogenic by the
process of natural selection and the other possibility being a virus becoming pathogenic by the
process of natural selection in an animal species and then jumps on to its human host [9]. Having
identified the genomic sequence and its predilection for the lungs, the next step was to find a
diagnostic test and discover medications to tackle the situation. [10]

151
152

However, a more important aspect of the disease in question has to do with prevention. Identifying
the appropriate factors related to getting infected and mortality would help plan in advance.

Till now the only valid and detailed analysis and correlation data relating to COVID 19 outcomes has
been related to age and sex variables. [11]

155
156
157
158
159
160
161
162

This is the first analysis to ascertain certain additional factors related to adverse outcomes
associated with COVID-19 infection. What is the correlation and its strength as far as getting infected
and mortality were concerned? Can we build a predictive model on the same using a linear
regression analysis? What is the recovery rate country-wise? Is there a difference depending on the
geographical region? How does GDP share of the country in question and the number of physicians
& hospital bed per 1000 patient available impacts survival? These are crucial questions which could
help us identify important logistics related factors contributing to the direction the infected
population would go.

163
164
165
166
167

We found a statistically significant 89% association with death once an individual gets infected with
COVID-19. There were 25 expected deaths per 1000 patient infected. This is in keeping with the case
fatality rates that are evolving worldwide, [12] with a significant percentage of these deaths
effecting the elderly.[13] With the help of regression analysis we could build a mathematical model
to predict death depending on the number infected.

168
169
170
171
172
173
174

Germany has a very low death rate in spite of being on the top 6 countries being affected. This could
be attributed to the highest physician and hospital bed per 1000 patient ratio among the top 6
countries. It should also be noted here that recovery rates in China improved dramatically after an
increase in the number of beds made available, along with strong quarantine measures that were
applied. This analysis bolsters the notion that higher number of hospital beds per 1000 population
corelates with a lower death rate. This might provide the basis to make an appropriate calculation
and get a proportional amount of beds prepared in advance.

175
176
177

It is interesting to note that GDP share has no correlation whatsoever with both the infection rates
as well as mortality. Wealth and economic resources may therefore not be adequate in tackling the
scourge of this novel coronavirus.

178
179
180
181
182
183
184
185
186

What is most revealing about this data, however, is that higher testing rates improved recovery
rates. Increased number of tests were significantly correlated with 1) a reduction in the number of
new cases, 2) a reduction in the number of active cases and 3) most importantly with a reduction in
the number of critically ill patients. This would indicate that the best option to deter this pandemic is
higher number of tests being conducted in all populations. Intuitively one could surmise that
increasing tests would identify the infected individuals early in the disease process providing more
robust and aggressive treatment to this population, improving morbidity and probably mortality.in
addition it would warn the exposed to take strict steps to quarantine themselves, reducing rates of
new and active cases.

187

5.1 Study limitations:

188
189
190

Firstly, correlation studies do not mean causality. The associations mentioned above are indicative of
certain trends only. However, at an early stage of a novel disease trends can definitely be a good
approximation for a large data-related analysis.

191
192
193
194

Secondly, due to extreme paucity of data from many countries, they were excluded in certain
analysis for example the one on testing frequency and outcomes. This weakness was overcome by
including the top 15 countries wherefrom the majority of the data were more homogenous and
devoid of significant outliers.

197
198

Thirdly, the correlation values are not indicative strong associations- both positive and negative.
However, this is due to the fluidity of the situation. We do not desire the numbers to go up to give us
opportunity for a robust analysis. This is precisely why we attempted to identify trends from the
updated data and guide our health care system to gear up for a better assessment of the situation.

199
200
201
202

Fourthly, the use of GDP as a measure of disease outcomes cuts both ways. If it is an indicator of
surplus wealth, then it is expected that a large proportion of the same could be channelized into the
health care facility and hence the outcomes. Hence, we choose to include both GDP as well as share
of the World’s GDP in this analysis to overcoming this confounding.

203

5.2 Strength of the study:

204
205
206
207
208
209

In contrast to the association data related to mortality rates and risk factors for the same like sex
age, other co-morbidities, this analysis is probably the first in its kind to look at the correlation
between infection rate/mortality and GDP, physician & hospital bed per 1000 patient population,
testing frequency and its relation with reduced new cases being detected as well as new deaths
being prevented. Although these are only trends, we believe these data will open up newer avenues
for health-care sector planning leading to effective management strategies.

210
211
212

6. Conclusion:

213
214
215
216
217

This is the first study to indicate that increasing resources in the form of increasing number of beds
per 1000 population reduces death from COVID 19 and improves recovery thereof. More
importantly this is the first dataset analysis which reveals that increasing number of tests for the
novel coronavirus would drastically reduce incidence and possibly death rates and morbidity from
this dreaded epidemic.
