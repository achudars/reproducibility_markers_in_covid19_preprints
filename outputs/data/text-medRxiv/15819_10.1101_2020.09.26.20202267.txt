Summary

1

The classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model formulated by Kermack and
McKendrick [1] assumes that all individuals in the population are equally susceptible to
infection. From fitting such a model to the trajectory of mortality from COVID-19 in 11
European countries up to 4 May 2020 Flaxman et al. concluded that “major
non-pharmaceutical interventions – and lockdowns in particular – have had a large
effect on reducing transmission” [2]. We show that relaxing the assumption of
homogeneity to allow for individual variation in susceptibility or connectivity gives a
model that has better fit to the data and more accurate 14-day forward prediction of
mortality. Allowing for heterogeneity reduces the estimate of “counterfactual” deaths
that would have occurred if there had been no interventions from 3.2 million to 262,000,
implying that most of the slowing and reversal of COVID-19 mortality is explained by
the build-up of herd immunity. The estimate of the herd immunity threshold depends
on the value specified for the infection fatality ratio (IFR): a value of 0.3% for the IFR
gives 15% for the average herd immunity threshold.

In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which

On this assumption the reproduction number Rt at time t is (1 − pt ) R0 where pt is
the proportion of the population that has been infected and is no longer susceptible.
The herd immunity threshold H – the value of pt at which Rt = 1 – is thus 1 − 1/R0 .
For natural infection, however, heterogeneity of susceptibility lowers the value of H [3].
If the distribution of susceptibility has a gamma distribution, in the expression above
1+1/α
(1 − pt ) is replaced by (1 − pt )
where α is the shape parameter of the gamma
distribution [4,5]. If connectivity, rather than susceptibility, has a gamma distribution,

the exponent of (1 − pt ) is (1 + 2/α); models with heterogeneity of connectivity or
heterogeneity of susceptibility are thus likelihood-equivalent. The classic model is thus a
special case of this more general formulation, in which α = ∞ and the distribution of
susceptibility or connectivity is a spike at 1.

We compared a model that allows for heterogeneity of susceptibility with the original
model that assumes homogeneity. The only change made to the original model was to
replace the expression (1 − pt ) by the exponent form given above, with a half-Cauchy(0,
5) prior on the shape parameter α. Flaxman et al specified an average infection fatality
ratio (IFR) of 1.1%, which is higher than most recent estimates. We repeated the model
fitting with country-specific IFRs scaled by a factor of 0.275 to equate the average IFR
to a recent estimate [6] of 0.30%. For sensitivity analyses, we repeated the comparison
of homogeneity and heterogeneity models after varying other modelling assumptions:
1. Replacing the sparsity-enforcing gamma priors [7] on the effects of interventions
with half-normal priors.
2. Removing country-specific effects, specified in the original model for the last
intervention only.

Table 1 compares the homogeneity and heterogeneity models. In comparison with the
homogeneity model, the heterogeneity model has better fit to the data (deviance
reduced by 23 units at the cost of one extra parameter) and better 14-day forward
predictive performance (mean squared error reduced by 59%). When other modelling
assumptions are varied, the heterogeneity model still has better fit than the
homogeneity model (Supplementary Table).
With the original mean IFR setting of 1.1%, the estimated number of infections is
about 13 million out of a total population of 374 million. Under a homogeneity model,
the early removal of susceptible individuals can slow the growth of the epidemic only
slightly, so the counterfactual estimate of deaths that would have occurred without
intervention is 3.2 million. Under the heterogeneity model, the growth of the epidemic is
slowed and reversed by the build-up of herd immunity, so that the counterfactual
estimate of deaths is only 262,000. Rescaling the IFRs to an average of 0.3% increases
the imputed number of infections approximately by the inverse of the scaling factor in
both models. With this setting of the IFR, the herd immunity threshold estimate
(average, inter-country range) was 0.154 (0.125, 0.181) under the heterogeneity model,
compared with 0.735 (0.640, 0.812) under the homogeneity model.
Fig 1 compares the two fitted models for the United Kingdom with the original IFR
setting. Under the heterogeneity model, the stepwise effect of lockdown on the imputed
daily number of infections is smaller than under the homogeneity model, and the
trajectory of the reproduction number Rt up to the date of lockdown approximates a
smooth reverse sigmoid curve.

Discussion

70

Models that allow for heterogeneity favour build-up of herd immunity rather than
non-pharmaceutical interventions as the main factor underlying the early slowing and
reversal of the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe. This is consistent with observations that
epidemic curves in many countries reached a peak less than two months after the first
few severe cases appeared [8,9]. With this dataset it is not possible to distinguish the
relative contributions of heterogeneity of connectivity, heterogeneity of susceptibility, or
any other process that could have generated a smooth downward trajectory in Rt over
about one month in each of the 11 European countries studied.
Because the model is fitted to observed deaths, the estimates of cumulative numbers
infected and herd immunity threshold depend on the values pre-specified for infection
fatality ratios. Specifying an average infection fatality ratio of 0.3% gives an estimated
herd immunity threshold of 15%. Whatever value is specified for the infection fatality
ratio, a model that allows for heterogeneity has better fit to the data than the
homogeneity model and supports herd immunity as the main factor underlying the
reversal of the epidemic.
One objection that has been raised to estimates that herd immunity thresholds for
COVID-19 are less than 20% is that far higher infection rates have been reached in local
hotspots such as Manaus [10]. However country-level herd immunity thresholds as
estimated here are not likely to be homogeneous over every locality. In hotspots where
the basic reproduction number R0 is higher than the population average, the herd
immunity threshold and overshoot of this threshold will be correspondingly higher, with
or without heterogeneity.
The release of the modelling code and dataset used by Flaxman et al is a valuable
contribution to transparent evaluation of infectious disease modelling. However once the
unrealistic assumption of no individual variation in susceptibility or connectivity is
relaxed, the model does not support their estimate that lockdown reduced the case
reproduction number R by 81% or that more than three million deaths were averted by
non-pharmaceutical interventions.
