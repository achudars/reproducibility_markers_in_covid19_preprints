characteristics of COVID-19 disease in Egyptian population with special consideration for its
mortality predictors.
Methodology:
8162 participants (mean age 48.7±17.3 years,54.5% males) with RT-PCR positive COVID19 were included. The electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical,
laboratory, and radiologic features. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate.
Results:
The in-hospital mortality was 11.2%. There was a statistically significant strong association
of in-hospital mortality with age >60 years old (OR:4.7; 95% CI 4.1-5.4;p<0.001), diabetes
mellitus (OR:4.6; 95% CI 3.99-5.32;p<0.001), hypertension (OR:3.9; 95% CI 3.44.5;p<0.001), coronary artery disease (OR:2.7; 95% CI 2.2-3.2;p<0.001), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (OR:2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5;p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR:4.8; 95%
CI 3.9-5.9;p<0.001), malignancy (OR:3.7; 95% CI 2.3-5.75;p<0.001), neutrophil-lymphocyte
ratio >3.1 (OR:6.4; 95% CI 4.4-9.5;P< 0.001), and ground glass opacities (GGOs) in CT
chest (OR:3.5; 95% CI 2.84-4.4;P<0.001), respectively. There was a statistically significant
moderate association of in-hospital mortality with male gender (OR:1.6; 95% CI 1.381.83;p<0.001) and smoking (OR:1.6; 95% CI 1.3-1.9;p<0.001). GGOs was reported as the
most common CT finding (occurred in 73.1% of the study participants).
Conclusions:
This multicenter, retrospective study ascertained the higher in-hospital mortality rate in
Egyptian COVID-19 patients with different comorbidities.

Egyptian experience in COVID-19
INTRODUCTION
A pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified at the end of 2019 in Wuhan city, China.
The pneumonia outbreak spread rapidly crossing international boundaries and was declared
as a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11th, 2020 [1,2]. The disease is designated
COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019 [3].
Acute COVID-19 pneumonia induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a
potential significant concern for morbidity and mortality, besides other induced lifethreatening complications that include, but are not limited to, arrhythmias, acute cardiac
injury, and shock. Critical illness mainly occurs in elderly individuals, especially with
underlying comorbidities as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease
(CAD), malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or chronic kidney
disease (CKD) [4]. Laboratory parameters associated with severe disease and related to
disease progression include ferritin and D-Dimer [5].
On 15/02/2020, Egypt declared the first reported COVID-19 patient [6] which increased to a
range of 710–5241 patients by March 31st [7]. In February 2020, the Egyptian Ministry of
Health designated a scientific committee for steering the national clinical COVID-19
management protocol. Due to lack of evidence for the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy

in the management of COVID-19, resource allocation to repurpose the utilization of antiviral
and non-antiviral medications approved for the treatment of other diseases was a potential
mitigation measure for the current pandemic [8]. It is reported that both chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine (potent inhibitors of DNA and RNA polymerase reactions) inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [9,10]. These medications are authorized as antimalarials and used in
the management of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and
rheumatoid arthritis. Considering its’ in vitro activity [9,10], safety for inpatient use [11],
availability, and effectiveness in some pilot non-randomized studies [12–14], the scientific
committee advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine as the main antiviral therapy in the
Egyptian COVID-19 management protocol.
We intended to investigate the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features
associated with in-hospital mortality in the Egyptian COVID-19 patient population.
METHODS
Study Design:
This was an observational, multicenter, retrospective cohort study conducted at 17 COVID19 quarantine hospitals in Egypt from March 20th till May 30th, 2020. The study design was
approved by the research ethics committee and the institutional review board of the Egyptian
Ministry of Health and Population. The informed consent for data collection was obtained
from patients or first degree relatives, the study procedures were carried out following the
Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki), all
information/images were anonymized and coded, and the privacy and confidentiality rights of
the study participants were observed throughout the study.
Study Participants:

Study participants were patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 referred for
admission. They were subjected to history taking and data collection for age, gender,
smoking, pregnancy, comorbidities especially COPD, rheumatic heart disease, DM,
hypertension, CAD, chronic liver disease, CKD, autoimmune disease and malignancy, and
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) of SARS-CoV-2. Screened participants were enrolled if they were admitted with
COVID-19 disease, confirmed by RT-PCR positive nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab,
and excluded if they were RT-PCR negative COVID-19 disease.
Study Procedures:
A clinical COVID-19 management protocol was prepared by the Egyptian Ministry of Health
COVID-19 scientific steering committee. An educational task force was established to update
the healthcare providers on the COVID-19 management protocol. Several hospitals were
designated for quarantine of patients with COVID-19. All study participants were followed
retrospectively from the admission date to the discharge date. Nasopharyngeal or
oropharyngeal swab for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 was repeated every 72 hours after clinical
remission of COVID-19 symptoms. The discharge criteria were the absence of the COVID19 symptoms for at least 3 days, improvement in the radiologic findings, and two consecutive
negative nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 obtained at
least 48 hours apart. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic,
treatment, and outcome data were extracted from the study participants' standardized
electronic medical records designated for COVID-19 quarantine hospitals.
End Points:
The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate while the secondary outcome was the
negative RT-PCR conversion rate and the time to negative RT-PCR conversion.

Statistical Analysis:
Retrospective data from the study participants' standardized electronic medical records were
collected and coded, and the data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social
sciences software (SPSS version 25). A quantitative (continuous) variable was considered
parametrically (normally) distributed if the z-value of skewness and kurtosis was between 1.96 and +1.96 [15] and the Shapiro-Wilk’s test had a p-value > 0.05 [16]. We found that our
quantitative (continuous) variables were parametrically (normally) distributed. Accordingly,
quantitative (continuous) data were expressed as means and standard deviations.
Parametrically distributed quantitative (continuous) variables were compared with the
Independent two-tailed t-test. Qualitative (categorical) data were expressed as proportions.
Qualitative (categorical) variables were compared with Chi-Square Test (x2). The probability
of in-hospital mortality was expressed as odds ratio (OR). The confidence interval was set to
95% (95 % CI) and the margin of error accepted was set to 5%. Any comparison considered
statistically significant was at P-value ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS
Study Participants and Procedures:
We reviewed the standardized electronic medical records of 8162 patients with RT-PCR
positive COVID-19 disease from 17 hospitals in one country from March 20th till May 30th,
2020. The study group was disproportionate with regards to the demographic data,
comorbidities, disease severity, and baseline laboratory findings (Table 1). The key
sociodemographic feature of the enrolled participants was slight male predominance (Mean
age 48.7 ± 17.3 years, 54.5% males, 45.5% females). All enrolled participants completed the
study and there were no withdrawals. The main presenting clinical features of the study
participants were fever (69.8%; 95% CI 68.8% - 70.8%) and cough (67.5%; 95% CI 66.5% 6

68.5%), respectively (Figure 1). The most common CT finding was the ground glass opacities
(GGOs) which were reported in 5962 study participants (73.1%; 95% CI 72.1% - 74%).
There was septal thickening in 2384 study participants (29.2%; 95% CI 28.2% - 30.2%),
consolidation in 2884 study participants (35.3%; 34.3% - 36.4%), lymphadenopathy in 1470
study participants (18%; 95% CI 17.2% - 18.8%), pleural effusion in 653 study participants
(8%; 95% CI 7.4% - 8.6%), peripheral subpleural involvement in 4163 study participants
(51%; 95% CI 49.9% - 52.1%), and multilobar involvement in 4679 study participants
(57.3%; 95% CI 56.3% - 58.4%), respectively. Pneumonia was the most common
complication in our cohort, reported in 1425 study participants (17.5%; 95% CI 16.6% 18.3%). There was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 996 study participants
(12.2%; 95% CI 11.5% - 12.9%), cardiac arrhythmias in 112 study participants (1.4%; 95%
CI 1.1% – 1.6%), myocarditis in 191 study participants (2.3%; 95% CI 2% - 2.7%),
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 320 study participants [3.9%; 95% CI 3.5% 4.3%), bleeding events in 12 study participants (0.15%; 95% CI 0.06% - 0.23%), acute
kidney injury in 350 study participants (4.29%; 95% CI 3.9% - 4.7%), acute liver injury in
204 study participants (2.5%; 95% CI 2.2% - 2.8%), and septic shock in 1098 study
participants (13.5%; 95% CI 12.7% - 14.2%), respectively.
Clinical, Laboratory, and Radiologic Features associated with In-Hospital Mortality:
A total of 7247 study participants survived their hospital course, while 915 study participants
died with an in-hospital mortality rate of 11.2% (95% CI 10.5% - 11.9%). The highest
mortality rate was in the severe/critical subgroup (646 study participants) (46.7%; 95% CI
44.0% - 49.3%) compared to the mild subgroup (68 study participants) (1.6%; 95% CI 1.2% 2.0%) and the moderate subgroup (201 study participants) (7.7%; 95% CI 6.7% - 8.7%),
respectively (P< 0.001). The in-hospital mortality was 23.5% in patients >60 years old
compared to 6.1% in those <65 years old (P < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality was reported

in 8.3% of patients with no comorbidities (511/6182) compared to 16.3% (159/977), 21%
(145/690), and 31.9% (100/313) of patients with one, two, and three or more comorbid
conditions, respectively (P < 0.001) (Figure 2).
There was a statistically significant strong association of in-hospital mortality with age >60
years old (OR: 4.7; 95% CI 4.1-5.4), DM (OR: 4.6; 95% CI 3.99-5.32), hypertension (OR:
3.9; 95% CI 3.4-4.5), CAD (OR: 2.7; 95% CI 2.2-3.2), COPD (OR: 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5),
chronic liver disease (OR: 2.5; 95% CI 2.04-3.2), CKD (OR: 4.8; 95% CI 3.9-5.9), and
malignancy (OR: 3.7; 95% CI 2.3-5.75), respectively (P< 0.001). There was a statistically
significant moderate association of in-hospital mortality with male gender (OR: 1.6; 95% CI
1.38-1.83) and smoking (OR: 1.6; 95% CI 1.3-1.9), respectively (P< 0.001) (Table 2).
Apart from the occurrence of bleeding, the presence of any of the complications, or the
presence of any of the CT findings was associated with a significantly higher risk for
mortality (Figures 3 and 4).
The lower serum hemoglobin level, higher total leucocytic count, lower lymphocytic count,
higher alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), higher C-reactive
protein (CRP), higher serum creatinine and ferritin levels, lower serum albumin, and higher
admission random blood sugar were shown to be significantly associated with higher inhospital mortality (Table 3).
Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was available in 1398 study participants in the moderate
and severe/critical subgroups only. A total of 192 study participants with NLR >3.1 died (26
%) compared to 34 study participants with NLR <3.1 (5.2 %). There was a statistically
significant strong association of in-hospital mortality with NLR >3.1 (OR: 6.4; 95% CI 4.49.5) and GGOs in CT chest (OR: 3.5; 95% CI 2.84-4.4), respectively (P< 0.001).

Negative RT-PCR Conversion Rate and Time to Negative RT-PCR Conversion:
The negative RT-PCR conversion rate was 86.2% by the 12th day of treatment and 95.9%
after the 18th day of treatment with a peak of 15.2% on the 3rd day of treatment (Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
With the emergence of the first COVID-19 patient in Egypt on 15/02/2020 [6], the Egyptian
Ministry of Health and Population designated a scientific committee for steering a national
COVID-19 management protocol to admit and treat COVID-19 patients in quarantine
hospitals. Considering its’ in vitro activity [9,10], safety for inpatient use [11], availability,
and effectiveness in some pilot non-randomized studies [12–14], the scientific committee
advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine as the main antiviral therapy in the Egyptian
COVID-19 management protocol. In this study, we analyzed data of 8162 patients with RTPCR positive COVID-19 disease admitted in 17 Egyptian quarantine hospitals from March
20th till May 30th, 2020.
Fever and dry cough were the most common presentations of COVID-19 patients [17–19].
Fever and cough were reported in 69.8% and 67.5% of our study participants. In another
study [17], fever was reported in 94% of patients and cough in 79% of patients. These
symptoms of presentation were not, however, associated with mortality [17].
Our study’s overall in-hospital mortality was 11.2 %. According to the baseline severity of
illness identified on presentation to the healthcare facilities, the mortality rates were 1.6%,
7.7%, and 46.7% for mild, moderate, and severe/critical cases, respectively. A retrospective
cohort study of 191 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China from December 29th,
2019 till January 31st, 2020 reported the death of 54 patients with a mortality rate of 28.3 %.
However, they didn’t report the stratification of mortality as per disease severity. In a meta-

analysis of 14 studies including 4659 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the overall mortality
rate was 25.5 % [19]. A higher mortality rate of 32.7 % was reported in high-risk severe
patients admitted to ICU in Lombardy, Italy. The in-hospital mortality rates published in
these studies are comparable to ours.
In addition to the baseline severity of illness identified on hospital admission and the
occurrence of complications during hospital course, the clinical and laboratory features
associated with in-hospital mortality were age >60 years old, male gender, COPD, DM,
hypertension, CAD, chronic liver disease, malignancy, CKD, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, high
CRP, ALT and AST levels, and higher admission serum creatinine and ferritin levels. The
Odds Ratio reported in our study suggested a strong association of the in-hospital mortality
with age >60 years old, DM, hypertension, chronic liver disease, CKD, malignancy, septic
shock, myocarditis, ARDS, DIC, acute liver dysfunction, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion,
and CT finding of multilobar involvement.
Several studies revealed higher mortality rates with advancing age [18,20,21]. A study by
Juan Berenguer involving 4035 patients in Spain showed a higher mortality rate with
increasing age >60 years old (OR: 7.5; 95% CI 6-9.4) compared to (OR: 4.7; 95% CI 4.1-5.4)
reported in our study [22]. This might be secondary to comorbidities linked to advancing age
and decreased immune response. CKD, malignancy and liver cirrhosis were reported to be
strongly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients with an OR for CKD ranging from
3.6 in many studies to 9.4 in one meta-analysis study, and OR for malignancy and liver
cirrhosis of 2.3 to 2.8, respectively [19,22]. In addition to their significant impact on
mortality, the higher incidence rates of hypertension (33.4%) and DM (30.9%) add to their
importance as measures of association with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Hypertension
and DM were reported as the most common comorbidities that impact mortality in many
studies [19,22]. In our study, hypertension and DM caused 3.9 and 4.6 folds increase in the
10

odds of death in comparison to other studies [17–19,22]. The previously known endothelial
dysfunction reported with hypertension and DM might explain their impact on the severity of
the disease and the high mortality rate [23,24]. Similar to other studies, our study reported
that the presence of more comorbidities increases the mortality rates apart from the type of
comorbidities [22].
Leukocytosis, lymphopenia, high serum CRP, ALT, AST, and ferritin levels reported in our
study were associated with higher mortality rates. Similarly, Berenguer et al reported
significantly higher mortality with higher neutrophil count and lower lymphocyte count. They
reported also higher CRP, ALT, and AST in non-survivors [22]. The association of higher
mortality rates with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, high CRP, and high ferritin levels might be
secondary to the dysregulated immune response in COVID-19 patients or superadded
secondary infections [25]. The higher mortality rate associated with lymphopenia might
represent a dysregulated cellular immune response characterizing COVID-19 [26].
Combining both, the higher NLR was associated with higher mortality. We reported an inhospital mortality rate of 26% in patients with NLR >3.1 compared to 5.2% in patients with
NLR <3.1. Similar results were reported in earlier studies [27]. The elevated serum
creatinine, ALT, AST, and low albumin levels might explain the higher mortality reported in
chronic liver disease and CKD. We reported a non-significant tendency for higher D-dimer
levels in non-survivors. Contrary to this, a significant tendency for higher D-dimer levels in
non-survivors was reported by many other investigators [17,28] representing the
coagulopathy pattern in COVID-19.
The most common CT finding was the GGOs which were reported in 73.1% of patients. Its’
presence showed a more than 3 folds increase in the odds of death in our cohort of study
participants. Despite their lower incidence of occurrence, the presence of consolidation,
pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy was associated with a significantly higher mortality

rate indicating a complicated hospitalization course. The GGOs were reported to be the most
common CT findings, and measure of severity and association with mortality in many other
studies [17,18].
Bacterial pneumonia was reported in >17 % of our study participants. Other studies have
reported pneumonia in 10.6% to 91.1% of their study participants [18,22]. The incidence
rates of acute kidney injury, septic shock, ARDS and other complications reported in our
study were comparable to other studies [17]. The incidence rates of cardiac arrhythmias and
acute liver injury were 1.4% and 2.5%, respectively, despite using hydroxychloroquine as a
standard of care in the Egyptian COVID-19 management protocol. This contradicts the safety
concern about the use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [29,30].
Our study showed negative RT-PCR conversion rates of 15.2% by the 3rd day of treatment
and 80.7% by the 10th day of treatment. Xiaowen et al. revealed similar negative RT-PCR
conversion rates of 10.2% by the 7th day of treatment, 62.7% by the 14th day of treatment, and
91.2% by the 21st day of treatment, respectively [31]. They also stated that elderly patients
and patients with chest tightness are more likely to have delayed negative RT-PCR
conversions [31].
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
Our study has strengths. There were on-site visits by the scientific steering committee
members to verify compliance with the Egyptian COVID-19 management protocol. The
incidence rates of the clinical efficacy outcomes were estimated, information was collected
on all relevant potential confounders, recall bias was prevented, and the causal inference was
strengthened. On the other hand, the study has limitations. There were inadequate reporting
and analysis of our interventions data so, couldn’t specify the pivotal medication which
played an essential role in the management of the COVID-19 disease. Updates to the

Egyptian COVID-19 management protocol were not applied to the current study. The
documentation process for laboratory investigations in the quarantine hospitals was
inefficient in the early phase of the study with subsequent missing data for the continuous
laboratory variables. Despite the study limitations, we collected complete data for the
categorical variables.
CONCLUSIONS
This multicenter, retrospective cohort study investigated the demographic, clinical,
laboratory, and radiologic features associated with in-hospital mortality in the Egyptian
COVID-19 patient population and confirmed the higher in-hospital mortality rate in patients
with comorbidities. Double-blinded randomized controlled trials are warranted to make an
inference about the treatment effect of the different management elements.
