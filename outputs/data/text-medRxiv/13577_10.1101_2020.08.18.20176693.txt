Abstract (words 250)
Background

Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) are the mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the
extent to which assay signals relate to exhaled virus is unknown. We investigated the use of
novel, non-invasive face-mask sampling (FMS) to detect exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two
studies.
Methods

In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after
diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second
hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a
positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations.
Findings

In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10/40 (25%) samples (4/6 individuals), with
no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post
diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards
disease severity.
In cohort 2, 19/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of
magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs
negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2],
p<0.001) and have active
cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and
breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS
negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of
sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up.
Interpretation

FMS detects exhaled SARS-COV-2, with stronger signals in those who develop severe
disease.

Introduction

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was
designated a global pandemic in 13 March 2020.(1) Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is by
exposure to respiratory secretions of close contacts.(2) Diagnosis by sampling of the
respiratory tract is critical for the prevention of further transmission, while recognition of
symptomatic disease (COVID-19) enables timely initiation of treatment.(3)
th

Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) are the current standard sample used to detect SARS-CoV-2
as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO).(4) However, NPS has a number
of disadvantages, including technical difficulty, risk to healthcare providers due to induction
of sneezing/coughing, and physical discomfort for patients.(5) Wide variations in sensitivity
have also been reported with NPS (32% to 65%) as well as oropharyngeal swabs (32% to
65%) and sputum (48% to >90%) with insufficient evidence for correlation of virus detection,
or cycle threshold (Ct) PCR values from any of these sampling methods to severity of clinical
disease or infectivity.(6-10)
Face-mask sampling (FMS) represents a novel method of respiratory sampling that is
applicable in routine clinical practice, where masks are compulsory for patients and clinical
staff. It is technically simple to use, minimises virus exposure to healthcare professionals,
and more comfortable for patients compared to NPS. We have previously shown the ability
of FMS to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis exhaled by patients with pulmonary disease,
informing the presence of active infection with greater consistency and at an earlier disease
stage than with sputum samples.(11,12)
We therefore investigated use of FMS in patients with COVID-19. Here we describe two
related observational studies. In the first cohort, FMS was used to measure exhaled SARSCOV-2 output compared with NPS during an occupational outbreak. Here, we aimed to
determine whether FMS enabled detection and longitudinal monitoring of SARS-COV-2
expelled from the respiratory tract and whether there were differences in excretion
patterns between individuals. In the second cohort we assessed a single mask sample’s
potential to detect exhaled SARS-COV-2 and relate this to participants’ disease severity.

Methods
Study Populations
Outbreak study

We identified an outbreak of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers in one clinical area of a
large teaching hospital in the UK, through routine NPS in April 2020. We invited affected
individuals to take part in repeated mask and NPS sampling.
Hospitalised cohort

We invited hospitalised patients from the three hospitals making up University Hospitals of
Leicester NHS Trust to provide two mask samples within 48 hours of diagnosis between June
and 2July 2020. We enrolled individuals who were age ≥18 years, able to give consent, had
no requirement for oxygen therapy by face mask or non-invasive ventilation and a
confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by NPS.
Study Design and Ethics

The outbreak study was opportunistic and thus the sample size was dictated by the extent
of the outbreak. For the hospital study we opted for a pragmatic sample size that could be
recruited during a pandemic.
The outbreak study was undertaken using service evaluation permission for staff members
and was confirmed not to require additional ethical approval. Hospitalised patients provided
written informed consent and ethical approval for this study was given by the Health
Research Authority (20/WM/0153).
Patient sampling and sample processing
Healthcare Workers positive for SARS-CoV-2

Each participant wore a mask containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sampling matrix strips
(figure S1) for 30 minutes and provided one contemporaneous NPS on days 1,3,5,7,10,14
and 21 following diagnosis by NPS on day 0.
Two exposed PVA strips were dissolved in molecular grade water (mH O) using a rotator
mixer for 60 minutes. Viral RNA was then extracted using the QIAamp high volume
Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
2

Combined nose and throat swabs were collected using cotton swabs (Deltalab, Spain) and
stored in a 2ml vial (Sarstedt, UK). Viral particles were released from the swab by vortexing
into mH O, prior to addition of Qiagen RNeasy buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Germany)
and carrier RNA (cRNA; supplied with the QIAamp high volume Circulating Nucleic Acid kit,
Qiangen Germany). RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Patient demographics, clinical and radiological data
2

We recorded this cohort’s demographics. Symptom data was collected at every time point.
The WHO severity criteria was used to grade severity of disease:(13)

- Mild disease: those who were asymptomatic, or symptomatic patients that did not
require oxygen or did not have findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on their chest x-ray
- Moderate disease – symptomatic patients who had findings of COVID-19 pneumonia
on the chest x-ray but did not require oxygen
- Severe disease – symptomatic patients who required oxygen supplementation,
regardless of chest x-ray findings.
Data on patient’s observations, radiology and oxygen requirements were also collected
when able. Patients were followed until 2 August 2020; where we recorded whether the
patient was dead or alive. Causes of death were ascertained by adjudication of death
certificates.
nd

Hospitalised patients positive for SARS-CoV-2

Under direct observation, each participant wore a mask containing a PVA sampling matrix
(Figure S1) for between 10- 60 minutes, though for the majority was 30 minutes. The first
sample was collected within 24 hours of the diagnostic swab by routine clinical analysis and
a second collected 12-24 hours after.
Two exposed PVA strips were added to a mixture of mH O, Qiagen ACL buffer, Proteinase K,
cRNA and our internal control virus (see below). This was vortexed, heated to 60°C for
30mins (outbreak cohort) or 70°C for 10min (hospitalised cohort) and centrifuged prior to
the RNA extraction via the QIAamp high volume Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit as described
earlier.
2

Patient demographics, clinical and radiological data
We recorded routinely collected data on demographics, clinical symptoms, observations and
radiology in this cohort of hospitalised patients. We graded severity of the patient’s disease
in three ways; whether they required oxygen at any point during hospital stay, their
National Early Warning Score-2 (NEWS-2) at time of first FMS and by the WHO severity
criteria.
Patients were followed until 2 August 2020; where we recorded whether the patient was
dead or alive. Causes of death were ascertained by adjudication of death certificates.
nd

RT-qPCR for RNA detection
A positive control prepared from a strongly SARS CoV-2 positive swab provided a positive
control included in every assay run. An internal control prepared from cultured Human
Coronavirus HCoV-OC43 was added to each sample prior to RNA extraction. The run results
were accepted if the internal and positive control values fell within 2 Cts of their individual
mean.
RNA was detected and quantified using the QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen,
Germany) and a Rotor-Gene Q thermocyler (Qiagen, Germany). For the hospitalised cohort
two target genes were used the E (Sarbeco) and RdRp-Hel (14,15) and for the outbreak
cohort it was just the E assay.
Further detail is provided in the online supplement.

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the demographics, clinical symptoms and
radiological findings of all patients. The independent t-test was used for continuous data.
Fisher’s exact test (less than five observations in each cell) or Pearson’s chi-squared test (at
least five observations in each cell) were used for nominal data and the Mann-Whitney Utest was used for non-parametric data to examine differences between those who tested
positive and negative on FMS. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 14.2
(StataCorp, United States) and Excel version 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, United States). A p
value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables are displayed as
median and interquartile range (IQR).

Results

Preliminary Results
Assay performance is outlined in the online supplement. Technical sensitivity in RNA
analysis was closely comparable to the multiple platforms used in our local diagnostic
service. Quantitative recovery of captured virus from PVA gave Cts within 1 cycle of a
contemporaneous water diluted control (not shown). Comparing the two viral targets
assayed from FMS and swabs, the E gene appeared the more sensitive with 61 positives of
which 44 were also positive by RdRp–Hel assay, while E assay was negative in only one
sample for which RdRp-Hel was positive. E target Cts ranging from 17.69 to 36.34 were
recorded indicating a 4x10 -fold difference in viral RNA output between positive
participants. RNA signals were shown to be stable in PVA strips spiked with cultured SARSCoV-2 stored over 7 days while assay of unprocessed, exposed PVA strips stored dry at room
temperature indicated signal stability over 3 months (Table S2).

Outbreak Study
Characteristics of cohort
Of ten healthcare workers who were screened for SARS-CoV-2, one female and five males
were diagnosed by routine diagnostic PCR (Aus Diagnostics, Chesham, UK) from NPS. The
median age of this cohort was 29 years (range: 26-38), three participants (50%) were of
Chinese ethnicity and three (50%) were white. Symptoms varied from asymptomatic to
severe, as defined by the WHO COVID-19 disease severity classification. Table S3
(supplemental data) outlines their symptoms and oxygen requirements. All survived, though
two continue to have anosmia (IDs 3 & 5) four months later and only one (ID 3) required
hospitalisation for oxygen supplementation and treatment of sepsis.
Forty paired FMS and NPS samples were collected in the first 21 days of their illness (Figure
1). Day 1 samples were not collected for ID 3 and 4 due to delays in diagnostic confirmation
from their initial clinical sample.
Comparison of longitudinal FMS and NPS samples
Table 1 shows the analysis of FMS and NPS using the E assay taken for this cohort over the
first 10 days. By day 14 after the original diagnostic swab, all participants were negative by
FMS and NPS. Ten out of the 40 samples taken from four of the participants were positive
by FMS (IDs 1-4). One individual (ID 3) produced two FMS positive, NPS negative samples.
Fifteen out of the forty NPS taken were positive, with two participants producing NPS
positive samples with negative paired FMS samples (ID 4 & 5). One person did not test
positive by either method for the duration of the sampling period (ID 6) in spite of their
positive diagnostic NPS on day 0.
Individuals with samples showing higher levels of FMS-detected viral RNA (lower Ct values)
and sustained positive FMS over time showed a trend towards greater disease severity. Ct
values for FMS were higher compared to NPS values(median FMS Ct value: 32.5 [IQR:30.134.1] vs median NPS Ct value: 30.6 [IQR:25.1-32.1]). Where paired samples were positive
there was no significant correlation between mask and NPS Ct values (N=8, r =0.03). FMS
SARS-CoV-2 RNA burden decreased over time for all participants, a feature less apparent

with NPS results. Discordance was observed between FMS and NPS; the FMS was more
likely to be positive in severe disease.

Hospitalised cohort
Characteristics of cohort
For this direct comparison study, 47 of the 438 patients screened were consented and
enrolled (Figure 2). The median age of this cohort was 63 years (IQR: 49-77); 32 participants
were male (68%); the majority (33 [70%] were white, 12 [25%] were Asian and two [5%]
were Black). The cohort’s clinical and demographic characteristics are summarised in Table
3.
Using the WHO disease severity criteria, 27 (57%) of the cohort had mild disease of which 18
(67%) were asymptomatic. Twenty-one (45%) participants had moderate disease and 7
(15%) had severe disease.
FMS positivity within the cohort
Twenty-seven (57%) participants were sampled twice. Two mask samples from two
individuals were removed from the analysis due to unsatisfactory internal control assays
resulting in 74 mask samples from 47 participants analysed.
Overall 29/74 FMS were positive from 19 participants with a median E Ct value of 31.8 (IQR:
27.0-33.8). Of those who gave two FMS, three (11%) had discordant results, two (ID01012,
ID01045) negative to positive and one (ID01041) positive to negative, potentially related to
their natural history infection. The FMS results of those participants with at least one mask
positive are summarised in Table 2 using the RdRp-Hel and E assays.
Association of demographic and clinical variables with mask positivity
Older participants were more likely to have detectable exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected
by FMS (median age 71 [IQR:61-84] for FMS positive, 61[45-73] for FMS negative). The
following risk factors were also significantly associated with a positive FMS sample;
cerebrovascular disease (FMS positive: 21%, FMS negative: 0%, p=0.02),
immunosuppression (FMS positive: 37%, FMS negative: 7% p=0.02) and cardiac disease
(FMS positive: 44%, FMS negative: 17% p=0.04 using E assay and neared significance with
the overall cohort (FMS positive: 42% FMS negative: 18%, p=0.07). Increasing comorbidity
was also associated with FMS positivity (median number of comorbidities for FMS positive
patients: 2 (IQR 1-3), FMS negative: 1 [0-2]p<0.001). The majority of FMS positive individuals
acquired their infection in hospital (FMS positive: 58% vs FMS negative: 21%, p=0.03).
Symptoms of cough and breathlessness were significantly associated with FMS positivity
(FMS positive: 68% vs FMS negative: 25% p=0.003 for cough & FMS positive: 74% vs FMS:
negative 32%, p=0.005 for breathlessness respectfully). Severity of lung involvement, whilst
not significant for the overall cohort, was related to FMS positivity using the individual
assays. A higher proportion of lungs occupied by grond-glass shadowing on the chest x-ray
was associated with a higher likelihood of a positive FMS using the RdRp-Hel assay (for
participants who had over two-thirds of their lungs occupied by ground glass changes on
chest x-ray, 43% were FMS positive and 7% were FMS negative, p=0.003 table S4). A lower
Ct value (and therefore higher viral burden) was observed in those who were FMS positive
by the E assay (Median Ct value for patients who had over 50% of their lungs occupied by

Discussion

In these studies, we provide the first insights into exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA, isolated directly
from infected individuals by FMS. We show that FMS can detect viral RNA both at the time
of diagnosis and up to 10 days thereafter and that signals identified from FMS can range
over five orders of magnitude. Exhaled SARS-CoV-2 signals were more likely to be present in
older patients, with multi-morbidity and in those with active respiratory symptoms at time
of sampling.
FMS detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from exhaled breath of both healthcare workers and
hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19. We observed a 40% FMS positivity rate in
our hospitalised cohort; in our outbreak cohort this was higher (4/6 66%), though this
difference most likely reflected the small sample size. The E assay was more sensitive than
the RdRp-Hel, identifying five more mask positives in our hospitalised cohort and one in our
outbreak cohort.
Within out outbreak cohort, the NPS results were consistent with the findings of Arons et al
who found that viral loads detected by NPS were similar over 7 days regardless of clinical
disease severity.(16) However, we found that healthcare workers were more likely to exhale
virus if they had severe disease. In contrast to our own NPS Ct values, which did not
convincingly change over time, the Ct values obtained by FMS consistently increased over
the course of patients’ disease.
Within our hospitalised cohort participants who had radiological evidence of severe disease,
and established risk factors for worse outcome were more likely to have detectable exhaled
virus. FMS positivity also showed potential in predicting development of Covid-19
pneumonia in those who were asymptomatic at time of sampling.
We aimed here to assess use of FMS in the COVID-19 pandemic with simple outcome
measurements. Future studies should focus on further investigation of whether FMS could
detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in individuals who are pre-symptomatic, and predict hospitalisation.
Since FMS captures exhaled virus, it also has the potential to quantify the amount of
infectious virus emitted and may therefore assess infectiousness of individuals; a potentially
valuable tool in both understanding and halting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Limitations

In order to use FMS, we included only patients who did not require oxygen delivered by
facemask, non-invasive or invasive ventilation at the time of sampling. We also focused on
hospitalised patients in the larger study, which lead to a limited spectrum of disease; the
majority of our patients had mild COVID-19 infection. This meant applying assessment
criteria such as the NEWS-2 or WHO severity criteria was problematic.
Whilst the WHO criteria have not been validated for clinical outcome, it was chosen
alongside NEWS-2 as it is simple, clinically plausible, globally accepted and deployed in both
high and low resource settings; settings where FMS can be easily deployed. There was a
significant proportion of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 in our second cohort and therefore
our clinical outcomes were complicated by other causes of hospital admission.
Although comparable in number to our other FMS studies, the sample size in both studies
was small. As such, extrapolation of our findings should be done with caution and larger

studies are indicated. This limited sample size potentially explains the difference observed
between the associations of clinical phenotype with the two gene assays (E and RdRp-Hel).
Finally, as is well recognised, RNA signals do not equate to the presence of replication
competent and likely infectious viral particles. We note that virus can be recovered in cell
culture from our PVA strips (data not shown) and that it will be important to correlate RNA
signals with replication-competent virus levels in the future.
Conclusion

FMS offers a novel, clinically compatible approach that captures exhaled SARS-CoV-2
directly from infected individuals and is related to disease severity. Exhaled virus is
potentially related to infectivity, thus FMS could facilitate identification of contacts at high
risk of infection and wider public health control efforts.
