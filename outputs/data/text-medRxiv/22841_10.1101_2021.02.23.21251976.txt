Abstract:
Background: A ad-hoc dedicated COVID-19 hospital was setup in New Delhi, India
over a span of 12 days. At this time, new teaching modalities were employed to train the
staff. This study aims to identify and quantify the effectiveness of these teaching models
in terms of learning which was evaluated using case scenarios before and after the
teaching session.
Objectives: To assess education methods and models for training of healthcare workers
during rapid deployment at an ad-hoc dedicated COVID-19 hospital.
Methods: The 5E (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) teaching
modality through peer group teaching methods was utilised in the situation. Statistical
analysis was done using Mann Whitney U test.
Results: A total of 86 participants (43 doctors and 43 nurses) answered the pre and
post test questionnaires. The number of correct responses per question in the pre test
(Mean + SD;49.0+ 18.53) vs post test (Mean + SD;54.40+ 15.95) with stratification by
the domain of learning was analysed. No significant difference was found in the pre and
post test responses.

Introduction

At the dawn of 21st century, mankind was faced with a daunting challenge, the
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease was believed to have
been originated in the Wuhan province of Chine, in December 2019 (Singhal 2020).
The World Health Organisation declared this as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. In the
current scenario, with the disease spreading over 220 countries and affecting over 17
million people and a death toll of more than half a million, healthcare facilities have
been established throughout the world to tackle the rising numbers (Bedford et al. 2020;
Bouadma et al. 2020).
In these desperate times, the healthcare providers have come up with newer
means to battle this disease. This includes establishment of ad hoc healthcare facilities
built exclusively for COVID-19 positive patients. These include a 1000 bedded
temporary COVID-19 hospital that has been setup in the Indian capital, New Delhi over
a span of 12 days. The hospital was run by staff flown to Delhi and deployed in this
hospital over a span of 2 days. The health care workers (HCWs) of varied experience
and specialities, needed innovative teaching modalities to provide them with latest

information regarding management of COVID-19 in as little time as possible, while
ensuring that adequate working knowledge was communicated. This was attempted
using the 5E (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) teaching modality
through peer group teaching methods. Here, we look at the newer teaching methods and
models that were used during one such session and their impact on the knowledge and
behaviours of the HCWs.
The study aims to identify and quantify the effectiveness of these teaching
models in terms of learning which was evaluated using case scenarios before and after
the teaching session using web based survey tools.

Methods

This study reports results of a pre and post teaching cross-sectional online questionnaire
conducted in a population of health care workers, which included doctors and nurses
deployed in management of COVID-19 infection in a temporary 1000 bedded COVID19 hospital. Four case scenarios, each with five questions were handed out. The answers
were collected on the spot. The questions were divided to assess cognitive and affective
domains of learning (eight of the twenty questions were affective and the remaining
cognitive). The learning modalities used were 5E and peer group teaching methods.
The study was based in a dedicated 1000 bedded COVID-19 hospital, set up in the
national capital of India, Delhi, in view of the surge in number of COVID 19 cases.
HCWs involved in direct patient care in this hospital constituted the study population.
Our study included a total of 86 participants, including 43 doctors and 43 nurses.
Clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee was taken.

An hour-long session was conducted for both doctors and nurses, before which,
an online form tool comprising four case scenarios with five questions each, was
attempted the participants. This was used to assess the baseline knowledge of the
individuals. The case scenarios and questions were developed by doctors who had prior
experience in dealing with COVID-19 cases. This was followed by one-hour teaching
session, which was based on the 5E model (Barrow 2006; Açişli et al. 2011). Post the
interactive session, the participants were handed out the same questionnaires, to the
assess the efficacy of teaching. The clinical scenarios were read out and the nuances of
case management were explained by the residents. A flipped classroom session was
created, with the participants putting forth their doubts and ideas, which were
subsequently dealt with by the residents. Statistical analysis was done using Mann
Whitney U test and p values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

A total of 86 participants (43 doctors and 43 nurses) gave consent and answered the pre
and post-test questionnaires. The number of participants correctly answering a question
increased from a mean of 49 participants in the pre teaching test to a mean of 51
participants in the post teaching module (Table 1). There was increase in the mean
number of correct responses per question of both the cognitive and the affective domain
(Figures 1-2). However, on statistical analysis no significant difference was found in the
means of the pre and post test responses (p value 0.37). On sub group analysis of the
responses to the questions of the affective and cognitive domains, there was no
statistically significant difference (p value affective domain- 0.49, p value cognitive
domain- 0.27).

Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the healthcare facilities and these testing
times have created a strong demand for newer teaching methods for training of
healthcare workers, to be ready for deployment in a short span of time. This was a
unique setting which offered an opportunity to investigate newer educational practices
that could be used for effective manpower training. Our study brings forth the
differences in the response of HCWs to newer teaching modalities while being rapidly
deployed for the COVID-19 duties.
Our study population included doctors and nurses from across clinical and
paraclinical specialities who did not have any significant prior experience in the
management of COVID-19 cases. Hence, it was necessary that they be adequately
trained before they start manning ICUs to manage active cases. Due to the rapid
deployment of workforce, conventional methods of curriculum design and classroom
teaching could not be used. In the arena of pedagogy, it has long been recognised that
there is a ‘learning cycle’. The students have to go through this cycle in order to
inculcate and apply the facts being taught. This idea of the order of events involved
learning i.e ‘the learning cycle’ is not new and was first explored by Dewey in the year
1971. Mike Atkin and Robert Karplus in 1962 argued that exploration, term
introduction and concept application were the three-key concept of learning (Karplus
2002). The students were made to be interested in the subjects by allowing them to
‘Explore’ the topic, followed by new ‘Term introduction’, which was later built upon by
‘concept application’ in the form of classroom tests and practical exercises. The 5 E

model introduced by Bybee and colleagues in the year 2006 is a direct descendent of the
Atkin and Karplus method of learning (Bybee 2006). And further classifies the teaching
methodology into Engagement, Exploration, Explanation, Elaboration and Evaluation.
‘Engagement’ primarily refers to how a teacher incites inquisitiveness among the
participants by assessing their previous knowledge and promoting curiosity through
short activities. ‘Exploration’ allows students to ask questions and try and look into the
nuances of the topics being taught. The ‘Explain’ phase requires both students and
teachers to describe the ideas already learnt during the previous two phases. In
‘Elaboration’ the teachers challenge the limits of the concept understanding and
introduce newer ideas related to the subject. Finally, the ‘Evaluate’ phase is when either
the students themselves or the instructors assess the knowledge imparted in the previous
phases. One important aspect of the 5E learning method is the active student
participation. The same was ensured in this scenario. And a structured approach ensured
that all the steps were meticulously followed.
Another learning method extensively used in our setting was that of the ‘peer
group learning’. Peer group learning basically comprises of students teaching other
students about subjects on which they have more knowledge and experience than the
others (Dehghani et al. 2014). In this context, the internal medicine residents who are
students themselves but had prior experience in dealing with COVID-19 patients were
involved both in generating the case scenarios and the questions, and subsequently
answering the queries of the participants on this subject. Peer group teaching is known
to inculcate more confidence among the participants as it makes the teacher more
accessible and inculcates the basic ‘Exploration’ aspect of learning.
The usage of the above-mentioned methods in the setting of rapid deployment of
HCWs during the times of COVID-19 is something which has not been explored. Our

findings showed an increase in the learning in both the Affective and Cognitive
domains. There was no significant difference in the number pre-test and post-test
correct responses, even though there was an increase in the absolute number of correct
responses, however this could be a result of the small sample size . However more
studies on this subject should be undertaken so that an effective training methodology
could be developed for HCWs during these trying times.

Conclusion

The usage of novel methods of teaching for HCWs deployed in COVID-19 hospital
shows promise. In this preliminary study, the participants showed positive outcome in
terms of the increase in correct responses to an online questionnaire based on case
scenarios inculcating concepts and ideas behind management of COVID-19 patients,
even though the results are not significant for which we might require better powered
studies. The affective and cognitive domains both showed an increase in the absolute
number of correct responses. As newer studies and case series are providing us with
ever so evolving knowledge about COVID-19, such teaching methods are an important
part of the armamentarium of the organisations all over the world to train HCWs even
with a time crunch and keep them in the loop with latest findings regarding COVID-19.
