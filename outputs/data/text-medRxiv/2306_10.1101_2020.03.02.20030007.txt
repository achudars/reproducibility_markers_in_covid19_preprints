Abstract
The interventions and outcomes in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are highly
varied. The disease and the interventions both impose costs and harm on society.
Some interventions with particularly high costs may only be implemented briefly. The
design of optimal policy requires consideration of many intervention scenarios. In this
paper we investigate the optimal timing of interventions that are not sustainable for a
long period. Specifically, we look at at the impact of a single short-term non-repeated
intervention (a “one-shot intervention”) on an epidemic and consider the impact of the
intervention’s timing. To minimize the total number infected, the intervention should
start close to the peak so that there is minimal rebound once the intervention is stopped.
To minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, leading to initial reduction and
then having a rebound to the same prevalence as the pre-intervention peak rather than
one very large peak. To delay infections as much as possible (as might be appropriate if
we expect improved interventions or treatments to be developed), earlier interventions
have clear benefit. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions
are less effective than targeting the interventions in each subcommunity separately.

Author Summary
Some interventions which help control a spreading epidemic have significant adverse effects
on the population, and cannot be maintained long-term. The optimal timing of such an
intervention will depend on the ultimate goal.

• Interventions to delay the epidemic while new treatments or interventions are developed
are best implemented as soon as possible.
• Interventions to minimize the peak prevalence are best implemented partway through
the growth phase allowing immunity to build up so that the eventual rebound is not
larger than the initial peak.
• Interventions to minimize the total number of infections are best implemented late in
the growth phase to minimize the amount of rebound.
For a population with subcommunities which would have asynchronous outbreaks, similar
results hold. Additionally, we find that it is best to target the intervention asynchronously
to each subcommunity rather than synchronously across the population.

Introduction

The Influenza pandemic of 1918 was one of the deadliest epidemics of infectious disease the
world has ever seen. In response, many cities introduced widespread interventions intended
to reduce the spread. There is evidence [6] that some cities which implemented these interventions later had fewer deaths. This seemingly counter-intuitive observation suggests that
they were more successful by being slow to respond.
When the 2009 influenza pandemic first arrived outside of Mexico, many schools shut after
the first observed infection. Once these schools reopened, and received a new introduction,
the remaining susceptible population was almost as large as at the outset, so the resulting
epidemic was likely to be nearly as large as the original epidemics would have been. The
closure provided increased time to prepare a response and learn more about the disease, but
the overall epidemic was very similar to what would have happened without the closure. In
contrast, evidence suggests that summer holidays altered the final outcome of the pandemic
(at least in the UK), significantly reducing the total number of infections by splitting the
epidemic into two smaller peaks [13].
The phenomenon can be explained by noting that epidemics rely on two things to spread:
infected individuals and a supply of susceptible individuals. If the intervention is too early,
the number infected may fall, but there will be enough susceptibles available that it can
re-establish and grow again. When it returns to the original size, the remaining susceptible
population will be effectively the same size as it was the first time. Thus, the intervention
primarily delays the spread; the resulting epidemic is comparable to what would have been
seen before. However, if the intervention occurs once the susceptible population has been
noticeably depleted, then the number of infections falls and when the intervention is relaxed,
the depleted susceptible population makes the rebound smaller or even nonexistent.
To make this explanation more robust, we note that is well-known that after an unmitigated epidemic, the total number of infections exceeds the number of infections required
to achieve the “herd immunity threshold” (the level of immunity required to reduce the
effective reproduction number below one) [8]. We refer to this extra level of infection as the

“overshoot”. It is a consequence of the fact that when the effective reproduction number
(in absence of intervention) finally falls to 1, the population reaches the “herd immunity
threshold” and incidence no longer increases. However, because the epidemic is at its peak,
this is the time at which those who have escaped infection so far face the highest force of infection. As the number infected falls, significant transmission still happens and the epidemic
overshoots the herd immunity threshold. In the absence of further intervention, the size of
the overshoot is determined by the number infected when the herd immunity threshold is
reached.
When we think about this in terms of a temporary intervention, the option to minimize
the total number of infections becomes clearer. A short intervention that ends with the
effective reproduction above one would see a rebound and would see a larger overshoot than
a slightly later intervention that ends with the effective reproduction number equal to 1.
This underlies the explanation of [6] for why temporary interventions are generally more
effective if introduced later in the epidemic (but not too late). Similar, more detailed theoretical results have been found by [19, 1]. Most studies of these effects are focused on a
single population, and they do not carefully consider the tradeoffs between competing goals
of delaying infections, reducing the peak prevalence, or reducing the total size.
In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, China introduced drastic control measures very
early. These significantly reduced transmission, apparently reducing the effective reproduction number (the number of new infections per infected individual) below one [23, 39],
although it took a very long time for new cases to stop. Despite quite significant interventions
in Italy in force for a long period of time, the rate of new cases was slow to fall [9].
Many other places have turned to aggressive control of infection in an attempt to keep
transmission suppressed [20, 24, 18, 33, 37, 3, 22].
In places which have have nearly eliminated the disease, the threat of re-emergence
requires constant vigilance. In places which have failed to contain transmission, the pervasive
interventions that would be required to get transmission low would impose significant costs
through the entire population, and such extensive interventions are unlikely to be maintained
long term. Thus policy-makers face challenges about whether or when to implement such
restrictive interventions.
Motivated by ongoing decisions facing policy makers for the COVID-19 pandemic, we
develop mathematical models which allow us to explore how to time short-term interventions in response to an emerging epidemic. We will refer to these temporary interventions as
“one-shot” interventions, meaning that the intervention cannot be maintained indefinitely
or repeated. We are particularly interested in how the timing might affect the total fraction infected and the peak prevalence, but we are also interested in the resulting delay of
infections.
We must exercise care in determining that a given intervention cannot be sustained. In
the initial phase of the pandemic there was significant uncertainty in the fatality rate. With
this in mind [38], the tolerance of the population for drastic interventions could be significant.
What might appear to be an unsustainable intervention given one set of assumptions about
severity may in fact be sustainable under another set of assumptions. We assume perfect

information and focus on choosing the time at which a given strategy will be more effective.
A separate, but related line of research focuses on whether (and how long) we should hold
an intervention in reserve while we learn more about the disease: sometimes the greatest
expected benefit comes from learning more before choosing the intervention [5, 26, 32]. For
an epidemic that grows quickly (like the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic), there
is effectively no time to learn about the disease before a decision is needed, and so these
strategies would not be relevant until strong enough interventions are in place to suppress
transmission.
We model an infection spreading in an initially fully susceptible population. We will
model the spread within a single well-mixed population and a population made up of several
weakly-coupled subcommunities (a metapopulation). We will investigate the impact of intervention on the attack rate (the final fraction infected), the peak prevalence, and the timing
of infections, and in the metapopulation model we will additionally consider whether it is
better to have a synchronized intervention or to have the intervention timed separately for
each subcommunity. The important question of whether disease can be eliminated locally is
beyond our scope.
Our goal is not to provide predictions for a specific population, but rather to demonstrate
the generic impact of delaying a one-shot intervention, to show its robustness, and to provide
intuition and some guiding principles which will apply to more complex scenarios.
Our results have important implications for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. If an intervention cannot be sustained for an extended period of time but new interventions or
treatments are being developed, it is likely to be best to perform the intervention sooner to
delay potential infections until other methods are available to treat or further delay infection
(e.g., masks distributed, contact tracing implemented, healthcare capacity increased, therapeutic treatments identified, or even vaccine produced). However, if no other intervention
or treatment improvement is likely to emerge, then it is best if the intervention is “held
in reserve” until depletion of susceptibles has reduced the effective reproductive number
enough that the intervention will have maximal impact on the total number of infections (by
preventing the overshoot) or the peak prevalence.
We completed and released this research early in the initial stages of the pandemic (at the
end of February 2020) [11], but did not immediately pursue it further due to other pressing
questions. In the interim, a number of other papers have emerged studying related questions,
including [17, 14, 10, 15, 30]. It is clear from much of this work that nonpharmaceutical
interventions are an important part of epidemic control. In particular, the timing of an
intervention, be it in a single population or over different communities, has a major impact
on its effectiveness and overall outcome.
Our results provide insights into ongoing discussions of “circuit-breaker” interventions:
in particular, such an intervention particularly valuable because it can delay infections while
other interventions are brought into place, and it can keep the infection count low enough that
interventions that cannot scale well can remain effective. However, if there is no significant
effort to increase other interventions, then a repeated sequence of such “circuit-breakers”
may be needed or the circuit-breakers should be delayed.

In this paper, we first introduce the mathematical models we use to explore the impact
of a one-shot intervention against an infectious disease in a single well-mixed population and
in a metapopulation made up of several distinct subcommunities. Then we discuss results
from those mathematical models. Finally we discuss the implications of these results. In the
Appendix we develop some mathematical theory explaining the mechanism underlying the
effect in more detail.

Methods

In this section we introduce mathematical models for an “SIR” (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered)
epidemic in a single well-mixed population and in a metapopulation made up of several subcommunities. We assume that the intervention is initiated at a specific time t∗ (typically
once the cumulative number of infections I + R reaches some threshold), and that the intervention lasts for a fixed duration D. It reduces the transmission rate by a “strength factor”
c. We explore the impact of the threshold, duration and strength of intervention. In the
metapopulation model, we compare outcomes when the intervention is implemented in all
populations at the same time or in each individual population separately. In both models
we measure time in multiples of the typical infection duration.
We will measure the impact of interventions on three quantities of interest:
• the attack rate or final size: the total fraction infected R(∞),
• the peak prevalence or maximum value of I(t), and
• the average time of infection,
time
R ∞(or date) at which individuals become
R ∞ t, the Raverage
∞
infected. It is given by 0 −tṠ dt/ 0 Ṡ dt = 0 βIS dt/R(∞).

In general the (often conflicting) goals of our intervention are to reduce R(∞), reduce Imax ,
and increase t.
The value of minimizing the attack rate is clear as it minimizes the number of infections. The value of minimizing the peak prevalence is highlighted by the struggles that
many health systems have faced during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
importance of increasing the average date at which infections occur is somewhat less clear.
However, early in an epidemic, medical knowledge about the disease, health care capacity,
and testing/contact tracing capacities are likely to be limited. Important knowledge about
the transmission mechanisms may be missing. In this early stage where knowledge is increasing, any intervention that delays the bulk of infections until later is likely to help increase
both the quality of medical care provided and the effectiveness of interventions that may
prevent those infections altogether in the future. This may be particularly important for
interventions such as contact tracing which take time to put in place and lose effectiveness
when there are many infections.

2.1

Well-mixed population

To study an intervention in a well-mixed population, we use the standard SIR model [2].
Ṡ = −βIS,
I˙ = βIS − γI,

(1)

Ṙ = γI,
where S, I, and R denote the susceptible, infected and recovered fractions of the population
with S + I + R = 1. There are a few important quantities to consider.
• The basic reproduction number R0 : The average number of infections an infected
individual causes early in the epidemic in the absence of intervention and the absence
of any depletion of susceptibles. This is R0 = β/γ.
• The effective reproduction number Re : As depletion of susceptibles occurs or interventions are put into place, the number of infections an infected individual causes is
reduced. When Re < 1, the number of infections declines.
By measuring time in multiples of the typical infection duration, we impose that γ = 1, and
so β = R0 .
If R0 > 1 the typical behavior of an epidemic without an intervention is that at t = 0 we
have S ≈ 1, I is very small and R = 0. As time increases, I and R grow and S decreases.
The reduction in S reduces the effective reproduction number: Re = R0 S. Once S < 1/R0 ,
I begins to fall because recoveries outweigh new infections: I → 0. Some fraction remains
uninfected: S(∞) > 0 and R(∞) = 1 − S(∞) [2, 27, 29]. See Figure 1 for typical profiles of
S, I, and R in time.
We assume that at some time t = t∗ , an intervention that reduces the transmission rate
is introduced for a duration D. The intervention reduces β by some factor c. So from time
t = t∗ to time t = t∗ + D the transmission rate β = R0 is replaced by β = (1 − c)R0 .
During the intervention, the effective reproduction number is Re = S(1 − c)R0 . After time
t = t∗ + D the transmission rate returns to β = R0 , and Re = SR0 .
We will typically assume that t∗ is chosen based on the cumulative number of infections
I(t) + R(t) crossing some threshold. We choose a monotonically increasing measure I + R
because this lets us choose an arbitrary t∗ , which would not be possible if we focused on
prevalence (I) or instantaneous rate of infection (−Ṡ).

2.2

Weakly-coupled Metapopulation model

We will also investigate the effectiveness of interventions in a metapopulation made up of
distinct subcommunities that do not have synchronized epidemics. The most obvious reason
for this setup would be geographically separated populations. However there could be stratification by age, religion, ethnicity or socio-economic status. We are particularly interested
in whether it is better to time interventions to the dynamics within each subcommunity

It is well-known that if the subcommunities have strong enough coupling, the epidemics in
all subcommunities are effectively synchronised [4, 12]. In this case there is little distinction
between asynchronous interventions for each subcommunity or interventions synchronized
across all subcommunities. Thus to compare the results from synchronized interventions
with asynchronous interventions targeted to each subcommunity, we need to explore a population with weak coupling. We use a standard meta-population model [2], allowing most
transmission to be within a subcommunity and some cross interactions between the subcommunities.

fraction of susceptible, infected and infectious and recovered individuals in subcommunity i,
where i = 1, 2, . . . , N .
To simplify the presentation, all subcommunities are of equal size. The recovery rate γ
is identical for all subcommunities. As before we measure time in multiples of the typical
infectious period, so we set γ to 1. The cross-infection between subcommunities is modelled
by B = (βij )i,j=1,2,...N , where βij represents the rate at which infectious contacts are made
from subcommunity i towards susceptible individuals in subcommunity j.
We implement a weak coupling by joining the population in a linear fashion: population
i is only connected to population (i − 1) and (i + 1). The first and the last populations only
connect to the second and the pen-ultimate population, respectively. The entries for the
coupling/mixing matrix are generated as follows. On the main diagonal, the βii values are
set to 2 + (Unif(0, 1) − 0.5) where Unif(0, 1) produces a random number chosen uniformly
between 0 and 1. Off-diagonal entries are set to Unif(0, 1)(β ∗ /10) (β ∗ = maxi=1,2,...,N βii )
and represent a scaled and randomised version of the largest entry on the main diagonal.
This yields an R0 above 2, comparable to current estimates for COVID-19 [23, 25].
We will use this model to explore whether it is better to implement an intervention in a
synchronized fashion across all subcommunities or to implement it in each subcommunity.
In particular, we will consider the following scenarios:
• track Ii + Ri in each subcommunity and as soon as Ii + Ri > T for some threshold T ,
a one-shot control is deployed in the corresponding subcommunity,
P
• track I + R = N1 N
i=1 Ii + Ri globally and as soon as I + R > T , a one-shot control
across all subcommunities, and
• track each subcommunity and deploy the one-shot control is deployed across all subcommunities as soon as Ii + Ri > T for the first subcommunity.
One-shot control in a subcommunity is understood to mean reduction in the internal, incoming, and outgoing rates of infection with a factor of (1 − c), where 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 denotes the
intervention strength (we assume that the strength is the same in each subcommunity, and
if two communities are both acting, then the movement between them is scaled by (1 − c)2 ).
This reduction lasts for a duration D and, as soon as the control is over, the transmission
rates for that subcommunity are restored to the starting levels.
In our results, we will present the average outcome of simulations across 100 distinct
populations whose mixing matrices are chosen stochastically based on the rules described
above.

• peak prevalence, and
• average time of infection.
These are expected to be good proxies of the total impact on the population or the burden
on the health services.
We find that one-shot interventions that begin at the first sign of infection have the
most impact on delaying the epidemic, but they have little impact on the attack rate or the
peak prevalence. This is because only a few individuals are infected when the intervention is
implemented so not many transmissions are blocked. When the restrictions are lifted, almost
as many transmissions end up happening: the disease spreads in an almost fully susceptible
population, and its trajectory is very nearly the same, just delayed. In contrast if the
intervention is delayed until a non-negligible fraction of the population has been infected it
will have more impact on the epidemic’s shape.
For the weakly-coupled metapopulation model, the subgroups are likely to have somewhat
asynchronous epidemics. In this case it is better to implement the one-shot interventions
based on a local threshold rather than a global threshold. If the coupling is stronger, the
epidemics are closely synchronized and there is little difference between the strategies.

3.1

Well-mixed population

We can think of a strong, but temporary, intervention as dividing the overall epidemic
into two phases. We allow an epidemic to spread until the intervention is started. The
intervention resets I to a small value (that is, the intervention shifts the epidemic to a
new trajectory with a similar S, but a smaller I). Depending on how long the epidemic was
allowed to spread prior to the intervention, we have some new value of S(t∗ +D). Then a new
epidemic happens starting from the new initial state, spreading as if a fraction 1 − S(t∗ + D)
were vaccinated. The longer we allow the first phase epidemic to spread, the smaller the
value of S(t∗ + D), and so the smaller the second phase will be. An early intervention
truncates the first phase, but a later intervention reduces the second phase.
For a well-mixed population we find that the timing of a one-shot intervention has an
important impact on the total epidemic. If the intervention is put in place very early, then
the impact is to simply delay the epidemic. Because S(t∗ + D) ≈ S(0) the second phase is
effectively like the first phase without an intervention, but delayed. The delay is somewhat
larger than D because it takes some time for I to grow back to I(t∗ ).
Figure 2 shows the impact of an intervention in a population with R0 = 2.5 and an
intervention of strength c = 4/5 (it prevents 4 of every 5 transmissions), and duration 2
(time units measured in multiples of the typical infection duration). The figure focuses on
the impact of varying the threshold value of I + R at which the intervention is introduced.
Figure 3 shows how the optimal threshold changes as the parameters of the disease or
intervention change.

3.1.1

Impact on attack rate

The impact on the attack rate (the total number infected) can be understood by a mental
model of the intervention as a way to shift from the current epidemic trajectory to a new
epidemic trajectory with a similar number of susceptibles, but fewer infected (this is made
more rigorous in Appendix A.1).
If the intervention is introduced early on, it will have an immediate impact. However,
when the intervention is lifted, the epidemic rebounds until the number of infections is the
same as the original value. The number susceptible is relatively unchanged, and so a similar
epidemic happens with an almost identical epidemic curve once it rebounds, except with a
shift to later time. So an early intervention has little impact on the attack rate R(∞).
In Figure 2(a) we see that if the intervention is introduced later, there is clear improve-

threshold values of I + R for the intervention to start, from a minimum of 0.05 to a max of
0.9. The first column investigates the impact of duration from D = 0.1 to D = 6, holding
β = 2.5 and c = 0.8. On the second column, intervention duration is D = 4 and c ranges
from 0.2 to 0.9. Finally, on the third column, c = 0.8 and D = 4, and the values of β = R0
vary from 1 to 4. In all cases γ = 1. In the first row, the black curve denotes the threshold
for which Re = 1 when the intervention completes. In the three regions defined by the two
lines in the panels of the second row, the peak prevalence is observed after the intervention
has ended (from left to yellow curve), during intervention (area between the curves), or
before intervention (from red curve to the end of the figure). Where the two curves align,
the prevalence decays as soon as the intervention is implemented and then recovers to the
pre-intervention peak.

ment in R(∞), up to a threshold of I + R of 0.6, which is close to where the peak prevalence
occurs in the epidemic without intervention. This is because when the epidemic peaks,
Re = 1, and so if we immediately and dramatically reduce the number infected at this point
the epidemic quickly dies out.
As new infections do happen during the intervention, this mental model is only an approximation. It can be made more precise by recognizing that to reduce the attack rate
R(∞), the intervention is most effective if it is timed to directly block as many transmissions as possible. So we want to time the intervention to maximize the number
infected
R t∗of
+D
I(τ )dτ
individuals present while it is in place (mathematically we want to maximize t∗
given D, c, and R0 ).
Thus the ideal timing to reduce the total number of infections is not at the first hint of
infection (when there are not enough infected individuals to cause many transmissions), but
rather, a little before the peak, and if the intervention is perfect (c = 1), then at the peak.
This suggests that the more effective an intervention is, the closer we should be to the peak
before implementing it. It also suggests that for an intervention of a longer duration, we can
implement it somewhat sooner, but not significantly sooner. For a more infectious disease,
the need to begin the intervention near the peak implies that the threshold value of I + R
will need to be larger (though the time t∗ at which it is implemented is smaller).
These predictions are borne out by observations of the first column of Figure 3 which
shows how the optimal threshold value of I + R for implementing the intervention changes
as the strength c, the duration D, or the reproductive number R0 change. The earliest
interventions have the most impact on the average time of infection, while somewhat delayed
interventions affect the peak prevalence the most, and later interventions (near the epidemic
peak) affect the final attack rate.
3.1.2

Impact on peak prevalence

As in the attack rate case, an early intervention primarily delays the epidemic curve. It
does not significantly alter the shape. Thus the peak prevalence remains effectively the same
unless the intervention is delayed until S is noticeably depleted.
If the susceptible population has been sufficiently depleted prior to the elimination of
the intervention, then once the intervention is stopped, the epidemic rebound will be muted.
Moving the intervention later makes the rebound smaller still. However, it means that the
number of infections prior to the intervention is larger. There comes a threshold at which
the phase before and the phase after the intervention have the same maximum. This is the
time that minimizes the peak prevalence. Delaying the intervention past this value results
in a larger pre-intervention peak, while doing it sooner results in a larger post-intervention
peak.
Figure 2(c) shows the optimal threshold to reduce the peak prevalence occurs sooner
than to reduce the attack rate. We can understand this intuitively, because for optimizing
peak prevalence a moderate rebound is less of a concern than for optimizing the attack rate.
For the purpose of reducing peak prevalence, Figure 2(d) shows that the optimal time to
introduce the intervention is when the current prevalence matches the peak prevalence that

would occur once the disease rebounds.
We can crudely estimate the threshold necessary for minimizing the peak prevalence.
If we know a population’s reproductive number R0 and its initially immune fraction R∗
and susceptible fraction S ∗ = 1 − R∗ , we can determine the peak prevalence.1 In the limit
of a very long (D → ∞) and strong intervention (c → 1), at the end of the intervention
S(t∗ + D) ≈ S(t∗ ) and R(t∗ + D) ≈ I(t∗ ) + R(t∗ ). If D is long, but c is small enough that
we cannot ignore transmissions occurring during the intervention, then we need to correct
for the fact that S(t∗ + D) may be somewhat smaller than S(t∗ ). Accounting for these
transmissions further reduces the size of the second peak.
We can use this to estimate when I(t∗ ) will approximate the rebound. As this is not
strongly dependent on duration, or c, this explains why the optimal threshold for peak
prevalence does not vary much in Figures 3(b) and (e).
It is worth highlighting that in related recent work [30] showed that the penalty for
making a small error in the timing of the intervention is larger if it is too late compared to too
early. As we see in our figure, the error as a function of the threshold I + R appears roughly
symmetric, but because the optimal intervention time often occurs while the epidemic growth
is increasing, this means that being a little too late means a larger error in I + R than being
a little too early.
3.1.3

Impact on timing of infections

The impact on the timing of an emerging epidemic is an additional factor that plays an
important role. If we anticipate rapid development of new treatments or interventions, then
this may be more important than reducing the anticipated peak prevalence or total fraction
infected.
As we noted for the attack rate and the peak prevalence discussions, for very early
interventions (for which I + R is very small), the entire epidemic curve shifts in time.2 .
However, as the threshold increases and we start to see an impact on the final attack rate
R(∞) and peak prevalence Imax , we also see an additional impact on the average time of
infection. Unlike the other targets, a later intervention tends to have an decreased impact
because more of the infections have occurred earlier.
In a real-world context, we anticipate that the model may overstate the delay from a very
early intervention if there is significant transmission outside the population of interest. In
a setting where the disease is spreading outside the population, the reduction of infections
within the population during the intervention may be immediately negated by new transmissions from outside, which are likely to be increasing. So the effect to delay the epidemic
is largest if accompanied by reduction in transmissions from outside. However, in a setting
where the disease is not well-established outside the population (as occurred in China early
∗

There is an analytic formula for peak prevalence 1 − R10 − R∗ − ln(SR0R0 ) but for our purposes we just
need to recognize that R0 , R∗ and S ∗ are sufficient to determine it.

Of course if the disease is eliminated locally which is more likely with a small threshold, then the next
peak depends on frequency of reintroduction which we do not consider

Figure 4: Example of an epidemic spreading across 9 subcommunities with different contact
rates (see the Appendix A.2 for the precise mixing matrix B). The epidemic starts from
subcommunity 2 and it is run for T = 35 units of time. γ = 1 for all subcommunities. With
no control the attack rate or final epidemic size is 0.744.
We now consider a more realistic population which consists of coupled subcommunities,
effectively a metapopulation model. We again consider one-shot interventions that either
target the entire population at once (synchronous interventions) or that target individual
subcommunities at different times (asynchronous interventions). If they were strongly coupled, the epidemics would be synchronous [4, 12]. So the single well-mixed population results
would carry over. Our focus is on weakly-coupled subcommunities.

A typical plot of the prevalence level in each subcommunity is shown in Figure 4 in
the absence of intervention. The epidemic starts in subcommunity two but it then spreads
to the others. The entries of the cross-infection/mixing matrix are generated following the
description in Section 2.2, and the specific mixing parameters are given in the Appendix.
As before we consider the impact of intervention on attack rate, peak prevalence, and
peak timing. The overall effect of interventions is qualitatively similar to that of the singlepopulation model. However, we find that asynchronous interventions that target each subcommunity significantly outperform synchronized interventions that begin when either the
first subcommunity reaches a threshold or the global infection crosses a threshold.
For synchronized interventions, the overall impact is smaller, and the best outcomes are
not driven by the actual threshold value. Rather they result from the intervention being
timed to have significant impact on multiple communities, or optimally delaying the spread
between communities. Consequently, the ideal times for this will depend on the parameters
for between-community transmission, and are likely to be population-dependent.
Because the epidemics subcommunity may not be synchronized across subcommunities,
this means that when a synchronous intervention is applied some subcommunities may have
already completed their epidemic, or others have not yet begun. Interventions that are based
on the first population to reach a threshold may not be valuable if the particular intervention
is most effective if it disrupts patterns that do not appear until the first subcommunity has
effectively completed its epidemic.
In our results, we consider 100 simulated populations consisting of 9 subcommunities,
whose contact structure is generated from the random process described in Section 2.2. For
most results we present only the average behavior. We note that this aggregation may hide
important behavior from individual simulations [21]. However, except where noted, our
averaged results are qualitatively similar to individual populations. Where we look at an
individual simulation, we use the specific population of Figure 4.
3.2.1

Impact on attack rate

Our primary observation about the attack rate is that interventions acting at different times
for each subcommunity are substantially more effective than synchronized interventions.
The smallest values of the attack rates are achieved when control acts independently in
each subcommunity meaning that as soon as Ii + Ri crosses a threshold, the one-shot control
is switched on in subcommunity i. This is done independently of whether the efficacy or
duration of control is kept fixed, while the other is varied, see Figure 5(a,d). Typically, as in
the case of a single population, there seems to be a clear optimal threshold value which leads
to the smallest attack rate. Applying the control too early or too late leads to higher attack
rates. Fixing the threshold value and increasing the duration of control, see Figure 5(a),
or the strength of control, Figure 5(d), leads to smaller attack rates. Both strength and
duration of control have no significant impact on the attack rate if the intervention is too
early or too late.
Figure 6 shows how the best one-shot control works when the optimal threshold for
fixed control efficacy and duration is implemented. As expected, this plot confirms that

duration of control varies on the vertical axis, while in the second row duration is fixed

in each subcommunity, (b,e) global intervention when the first subcommunity breaches the
threshold, and (c,f) global intervention at global threshold for a population consisting of
9 subcommunities. In each plot, the x − axis shows the values that the threshold for

another by noting the largest Ii + Ri at the time the global I + R reaches a given threshold.

intervention happens close to the peak of the epidemic in each subcommunity so secondary
waves of infection are heavily suppressed.
The impact of the synchronized intervention based on the global level of I + R, see
Figure 5(c,f), or on the first subcommunity to reach a threshold, see Figure 5(b,e), are much
smaller than asynchronous interventions. This is because when it is implemented in the

Figure 6: Illustration of best control strategy (i.e. smallest attack rate) (controlling subcommunities individually but using the same threshold for each) when efficacy and duration of
control are fixed at c = 0.8 and D = 2, respectively. It turns out that the optimal threshold
is close to (0.4). This combination represents the point (0.4, 2) in Fig 5 panel (a), or equivalently the point (0.4, 0.8) in panel (d). With this strategy, we find that R(∞) goes from
R(∞) = 0.75 to R(∞) = 0.63. If we increase control duration from 2 to 10 we would achieve
a further reduction to R(∞) = 0.44. The vertical black lines show the onset of control.
have not yet begun. So there is less overall impact (see the asynchrony in Figure 4).
When the intervention is based on the first time a subcommunity crosses a threshold,
we find that the optimal thresholds are at relatively large values. This suggests that the
value of the synchronized intervention comes from disrupting transmission when the disease
is spreading in multiple subcommunities.
Under the synchronous intervention scenario, we also see some surprising behavior where
there are multiple local maxima for the specific metapopulation used in Figure 4 (not shown
in Figure 5). This effect is because the timing aligns with different outbreaks. If we intervene
at one time, we may have a big impact on one subcommunity, and if we miss that window, it is
best to wait until another subcommunity begins to have an outbreak. This effect disappears
in the aggregated data of Figure 5 because the specific ideal timing is a consequence of the

Here we look atPthe effect of the intervention on the peak prevalence, that is the maximum
value of I(t) = N1 i Ii (t) during the time course of the epidemics. As with the attack rate,
our primary observation for the peak prevalence is that it is significantly reduced by targeting
based on the individual subcommunity.
Figure 7 shows the average of the peak prevalence across the same 100 populations as
Figure 5. Perhaps not surprisingly, Figure 7 is qualitatively similar to Figure 5. The most
impact is through having interventions occurring when the individual populations reach a
threshold. The optimal choices for intervention come earlier in the epidemic. We still observe
that if the intervention is too soon or too late then there is no significant reduction in peak
prevalence.
In Figure 7 (a,d) the optimal threshold for intervention is relatively early, this is in line
with the trend observed in Figure 2 for the single population case. We should wait until some
immunity builds up before intervening, so that the rebound in each population is muted.
For our two synchronized strategies, the effectiveness is much less, because the overall
peak prevalence is related to how the individual subcommunities’ peaks align, and different

Interestingly, if we look at an individual simulations, there are thresholds which yield
significantly larger improvements in the peak prevalence than we see in the aggregated data.
This is because in each simulated population, the relative timing of the epidemics subpopulations depends on the system parameters. In a weakly-coupled metapopulation model with
relatively few subcommunities, the global peak prevalence is likely to occur when multiple
subcommunities happen to be aligned. This is highly sensitive to parameters, and so the
optimal intervention time will vary.
3.2.3

Impact on epidemic timing

When we investigate the average time of infection, we see that targeting the intervention
at each subcommunity is again the most effective. In general the interventions need to be
implemented very early in the epidemic.
Most of the impact comes from slowing the epidemic in the initial subcommunity. A
delay in the initial place of introduction results in a delay in all subcommunities. Once the
intervention is no longer in place in the initial subcommunity it begins to grow and spill over
into other communities. If other subcommunities wait until then to begin their response,
they gain some benefit. However, once they stop, they face rapid reseeding from the initial
subcommunity. So the main benefit comes from the initial subcommunity’s actions. When
we use a synchronized intervention, the effect is somewhat smaller, but it is not significantly
smaller.
In fact, most of the benefit comes from the initial subcommunity engaging in preventative
measures. There is relatively little impact on the average time of infection to be gained from
the other subcommunities acting early, unless they can maintain a very small spillover rate
for a long period through extensive travel restrictions or similar interventions. This suggests
that significant benefit may come from a hybrid strategy which focuses on delaying infections

Discussion

We have considered the impact of a single one-shot limited duration impact on the spread
of an infectious SIR disease, in both a single well-mixed community and in a weakly-coupled
metapopulation model.
We have found that in a single well-mixed population, an intervention at the first hint
of infection is best for delaying infections. An intervention that waits until the epidemic is
well-established but still well short of the peak is best to reduce the peak prevalence of the
epidemic. An intervention (whose duration would be D) that starts a little less than D units
of time before the peak would otherwise be reached is best to reduce the total number of
infections.
In a weakly-coupled metapopulation model, we find qualitatively similar results. The best
strategy to reduce either the peak prevalence or the total number of infections, a strategy
that times the interventions asynchronously to when each subcommunity reaches a threshold
rather than being synchronized to when the global average crosses a threshold or when the
first subcommunity crosses a threshold.

For delaying the average time of infection, the most important detail is that the subcommunity with the first introduction responds as quickly as possible. Whether the other subcommunities respond immediately or delay their response until more infections are present
within the subcommunities has a smaller effect.

4.1

Limitations

Our results are somewhat limited by the assumptions we have made to produce a tractable
problem.
We assume that behavior responds immediately to changes in interventions. In reality,
behavior may change prior to an intervention being implemented. Additionally adherence
may drop as the intervention continues, and some adherence to the intervention may remain
even once the intervention is removed.
The assumption that the individuals are largely homogeneous may lead to pessimistic
predictions of when the herd immunity threshold is reached. In the presence of significant
population heterogeneity, there is evidence suggesting that the herd immunity threshold
would be reached earlier, and the epidemic could proceed significantly faster [16, 7]. Our
qualitative predictions remain robust, but the timings would need to move sooner.
We must think critically about what constitutes a one-shot intervention. Whether an
intervention can be maintained may depend on context. Early estimates of case fatality rate
(not to be confused with infection fatality rate) of COVID-19 ranged from 0.7% in China
outside of Hubei province to around 2% in much of the world, to around 5.8% in Wuhan [35].
These estimates were affected by the proportion of cases identified (leading to uncertainty in
the denominator), and whether the health system was over capacity (which would increase
the death rate leading to uncertainty in the numerator). True infection fatality rates appear
to lie between 0.5% and 1%, with many estimates closer to 1% than 0.5% [28, 34, 31].
With such high fatality rates, our tolerance for drastic interventions should increase. Thus
an intervention that would be considered one-shot for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic which had
a significantly lower fatality rate [36] might be considered sustainable for the COVID-19
pandemic.
In deciding whether an intervention is sustainable policy makers could formulate an
answer to this question: “Assume you impose the intervention now, and infection rates
remain the same or higher in the future, and would increase if they were dropped, would you
be willing to maintain the intervention in place?” If so, then the intervention is sustainable.
If the answer is “no”, and the intervention will be abandoned at some future time regardless
of the new infection profile, then this is a one-shot intervention, and it should be held in
reserve until it will have maximal impact.
We have ignored logistical challenges that might be associated with implementing the
intervention separately for each subcommunity. On a large scale (e.g., states within a country
or cities within a state) we anticipate that this is logistically feasible, while on a small scale
(e.g., suburbs in a city) it is more likely that the epidemics will be synchronized and this
benefit is small compared to the logistical challenges.

Policy Implications

Our observations have a number of important policy implications for an epidemic which is
sufficiently established that elimination is not a goal. Primarily:
• To reduce the attack rate of an epidemic, a one-shot intervention should be introduced
shortly before the epidemic peak.
• To reduce the peak size of an epidemic, the intervention should be late enough to allow
significant immunity to develop, but early enough to allow a substantial rebound after
the intervention.
• To delay infections as much as possible, the intervention should be implemented early
on.
• In a population made up of many weakly-coupled subcommunities, interventions should
be asynchronous.
Because they require different timings, the three goals we have considered are in conflict.
The benefits of reducing the total number of infections are clear, and if health care capacity
is threatened, the benefits of minimizing the peak prevalence are also clear. It is less obvious
that delaying infections may help. However when there is an expectation that improved
treatments and improved inteventions may be developed, a delay is likely to be the best
available option.
An additional benefit of delaying the epidemic is observed when we have an intervention,
such as testing & tracing, which does not scale well. As the number of infections grows
ebyond the testing capacity, the effectiveness per infection goes down. At low infection
levels these interventions may be enough to suppress transmission. However, if levels get too
high, then a quick intervention that causes infections to drop may be more effective than an
intervention that waits until the optimal time to minimize the size.
Although we have focused on three distinct goals which lead to different optimal strategies, the ideal goal is likely to be a combination of these effects. So the timing will need to
respond to different pressures. If, for example, the goal is to keep the peak prevalence below
a certain value while minimizing the maximum prevalence, then the ideal strategy would
let as much immunity develop in the population as possible before the prevalence limit is
reached and then intervene (this is of course only feasible if there is a time that can keep
prevalence below that level). Delaying the intervention until this point would mean that the
second peak would be lower. If the goal is instead to keep the peak prevalence below some
level while maximizing the delay of infections, then the intervention would be sooner and
timed so that the second peak would reach the target prevalence.
We finally note that in a population made up of weakly-coupled subcommunities whose
epidemics will not be synchronized, the ideal intervention might be to react strongly and
immediately in the first subcommunity where the infection begins to spread. This can
provide protection to the other communities and significantly delay the spread. Once it
spreads beyond that initial subcommunity then the focus may turn to minimizing the peak
prevalence or the attack rate.

Figure 10: We plot S(t) versus R(t) for R0 = 0.5 (a), 2 (b), and 4 (c). For given S(t) and
R(t), the proportion infected is I(t) = 1 − S(t) − R(t), which equals the vertical or horizontal
distance from the point (R(t), S(t)) to the line S + R = 1. The curves and arrows show how
a solution to System (1) evolves in time. At points S > 1/R0 (which occurs only for R0 > 1)
orbits move farther from the diagonal, representing an increase in I. Note that the velocity
an orbit is traversed varies depending on location, and goes to zero close to S + R = 1. Red
dots in panel (b)-(c) indicate the point (S = R10 , I = 0, R = 1 − S).

A

Mathematical Analysis

In this section we provide mathematical analyses of the single population model to support
our results for reducing attack rate and peak prevalence.

A.1

A Phase-plane based analysis

Because S + I + R = 1, we can fully specify the current state and the future dynamics by
knowing S and R, in which case I = 1 − S − R. It will be useful to use this to explore the
dynamics of an epidemic and the impact of an intervention.
In Figure 10 we show how S(t) and R(t) evolve together in time for three values of R(0)
(0.5, 2, and 4) and for several different initial conditions. For a given point (S0 , R0 ), the
value of I at that time is given by the horizontal (or vertical) distance to the diagonal line
S + R = 1.
In the figure, we can see that if S > 1/R0 (which is only possible if R0 > 1), then the
horizontal distance from the orbit to the S + R = 1 line is increasing as the orbit moves
forward. In other words, I is increasing. Once S < 1/R0 , the distance decreases and
eventually goes to 0.
Using these orbits, we can investigate the impact of an intervention, as shown in Figure 11.
We follow S and R along an orbit. When we turn on the one-shot intervention at time t∗ ,
it no longer follows the original curve. Instead the change in S and R follows the paths we
would find for (1 − c)R0 , starting from the point (R(t∗ ), S(t∗ )). It follows this curve until
reaching (R(t∗ + D), S(t∗ + D)) when the intervention is halted. It then follows the curves
for the original R0 , but starting from this new point.

Figure 11: (S,R) phase portrait (arrows indicate growing time) based on an SIR model in
a single population with β = 2, γ = 1 (giving R0 = 2) and initial condition I(0) = 0.01.
The plot shows a trajectory with no control (continuous red line) as well as three other
trajectories where β = 0.5 for a time period of length D = 2 but with the intervention
setting in only once I + R goes past 0.1 (partially dotted line), 0.3 (partially dashed line)
and 0.5 (continuous broken line), respectively. Control for the three different scenarios sets
in at the points denoted by A, B and C and control ends at A’, B’ and C’, respectively.
Note that there is a point (R, S) = (1 − 1/R0 , 1/R0 ) at which separates the points on
the line R + S = 1 from which an epidemic could start from the points at which epidemics
finish. The closer an orbit is to this point, the smaller the attack rate.
So for R0 = 2, a temporary intervention gives us a way to move from one of these curves
in the R0 = 2 plot to another. We see this in Figure 11. The timing of the intervention
determines which of the orbits the system lands on.
In this context the goal of reducing the attack rate is equivalent to ensuring that the
intervention shifts the curve to an orbit as close as possible to (R, S) = (1−1/R0 , S = 1/R0 ).
Reducing the peak prevalence is equivalent to ensuring that the orbit remains as close as
possible to the line S + R = 1.
A.1.1

Attack rate

If our goal is to minimize the number of infections, we accomplish this by having the curve
(R(t), S(t)) land on an orbit that is as close to (R, S) = (1 − 1/R0 , 1/R0 ) as possible given
the constraints on the intervention.
Typically we have to wait until the curve has moved closer to the desirable orbits before
implementing the intervention. Implementing the intervention early, see the dotted line in
Figure 11 means that at the end of the intervention there is still a large pool of susceptibles
which are at risk of becoming infected. Crossing from A to A’ simply puts the epidemic on
a slightly different trajectory but the attack rate is very close to the case with not control.

An intervention at a later stage, see dashed line, improves the final outcome resulting in an
attack rate that is smaller when compared to the case of no control. Finally, the continuous
broken line shows an almost optimal intervention with a further small reduction in the attack
rate.
In general, the intervention that will get us closest to the optimal value occurs when the
original curve is close to, but has not yet reached, the largest value of I, which occurs when
S = 1/R0 . As the effectiveness of the intervention increases, the orbits it follows during
the intervention become more horizontal. For very effective interventions, this suggests we
should wait until very close to the epidemic peak, while for less effective interventions (which
will slope downwards more), we will want to implement them somewhat sooner.
A.1.2

Peak prevalence

For peak prevalence, the goal is to keep the curve as close as possible to S + R = 1. The
longer we wait to implement the intervention, the closer the final orbit is to S + R = 1, but
the farther the original orbit moves from the line. With this in mind it becomes clear that
the optimal t∗ to reduce peak prevalence is smaller than the optimal value to reduce attack
rate.

A.2

The mixing matrix

The cross-infection between subcommunities is modelled by B = (βij )i,j=1,2,...N , where βij
represents the rate at which infectious contacts are made from subcommunity i towards
susceptible individuals in subcommunity j.
We implement a weak coupling by joining the population in a linear fashion: population
i is only connected to population (i − 1) and (i + 1). The first and the last populations
only connect to the second and the pen-ultimate population, respectively. The entries for
the coupling/mixing matrix are generated as follows. On the main diagonal, the βii values
are set to 2 + (Unif(0, 1) − 0.5). Off-diagonal entries are set to Unif(0, 1)(βii∗ /10) (β ∗ =
maxi=1,2,...,N βii ) and represent a scaled and randomised version of the largest entry on the
main diagonal. This yields an R0 above 2, comparable to current estimates for COVID-19.
For most of our results we aggregate over 100 distinct simulated populations. However,
in figures 4, 6, and 8 we use a single realization of the metapopulation model. For this we
take the mixing matrix
