ABSTRACT
Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of the adaptive
immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by assaying the peripheral immune repertoire for
virus-associated T-cell receptors (TCRs). Secondary aims include identification and
characterization of SARS-CoV-2–specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) and monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) generated by antibody-producing cells during and after acute infection.
Trial design: ImmuneRACE is a prospective, single group, multi-cohort, exploratory study of
unselected eligible participants exposed to, infected with, or recovering from SARS-CoV-2.
Participants: Approximately 1000 individuals, aged 18 to 89 years and residing in 24 different
geographic areas within the United States, will be enrolled, primarily using remote telemedicine
technologies. Cohorts will be based on clinical history. Cohort 1 will include participants
exposed to SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks of study entry. Cohort 2 participants will include those
clinically diagnosed or with positive laboratory confirmation of active COVID-19 disease.
Cohort 3 will comprise participants previously diagnosed with COVID-19 disease who have
been deemed recovered based on two consecutive negative tests, clearance by a healthcare
professional, or resolution of symptoms related to COVID-19. All participants must be able to
communicate with the investigator and understand and comply with the requirements of the
study. Protected populations and those who may not safely participate are not eligible for this
study.
Intervention and comparator: Blood samples and nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs will
be collected from participants. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected by
inserting a swab into the nose or throat of the participant. Samples will be shipped frozen or
transported refrigerated or at room temperature to Adaptive Biotechnologies for processing,
including, but not limited to, testing for coronavirus or other respiratory illnesses, DNA
extraction, and TCR analysis. The immunoSEQ assay will be conducted using DNA extracted
from blood samples. An electronic questionnaire will be administered to collect information
pertaining to the participant’s medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests performed for
COVID-19 disease. Participants will have the option to undergo additional blood draws and
questionnaires over a 2-month period. In collaboration with Microsoft, we will use machine
learning and artificial intelligence approaches to construct a classifier based on TCR repertoire
data designed to accurately distinguish COVID-19–positive cases from unexposed controls (from
the ImmuneCODE database of TCR sequences). A rigorous statistical analysis will be performed
to validate the classifier.
Main outcomes: The main outcomes of this study will include a comparison of disease-specific
TCR signatures in patients and controls, identification of the immunodominant antigens that
elicit a T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 , risk stratification based on an individual’s immune
signature, and determination of immune signatures of patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 that may
allow earlier detection of infection compared to available tests.
Trial registration: “ImmuneRACE – Immune Response Action to COVID-19 Events (Protocol
ADAP-006, version 1.0; 5/8/2020) is registered with the US National Institutes of Health and can
be accessed at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04494893).

I.

BACKGROUND
Adaptive Biotechnologies has developed a platform technology for immune profiling called the
T-cell receptor eta-1 (TCR) Assay, also referred to as immunoSEQ§ in this protocol. The
platform utilizes next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify rearranged T-cell receptor
beta (TCRgene sequences and characterize the abundance of those sequences. This broad
platform technology can be used to determine the diversity of the cellular adaptive immune
system and track phenotype-associated T-cell clones to query the current state and history of the
adaptive immune system.
Detecting Specific TCRs for Diagnostics1-3
Despite the overwhelming number of possible T-cell receptors (TCRs), many TCRs are quite
common and repeatedly recur within and between individuals, comprising the public T-cell
repertoire4. These public TCRs are diagnostically useful because once a TCR has been associated
with a particular antigen or disease state, the association is reliable, even when that TCR is seen
in a new individual. Using this technique, we have demonstrated that CMV infection can be
assayed purely based on the peripheral TCR repertoire3.
When specific TCRs associated with particular antigens or disease states are known, scanning the
T-cell repertoire for those specific sequences can be clinically useful. The purpose of this research
study is to explore the immune system in individuals with coronavirus disease.

PROPOSED RESEARCH
The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly
throughout the world. Researchers, governments, and biotechnology companies are mobilizing to
develop and disseminate diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives to try to curb this global
pandemic. The vast majority of these R&D efforts are focused on the RNA of the virus itself,
rather than critical information held within the genetics of a patient’s immune response to the
virus and the disease patterns that can be inferred through study of the immune response at the
population level.
First, we will identify antigens, the parts of the virus that induce a cellular immune response via
T cells. We do this by rapidly determining the nearly full set of processed, presented,
immunogenic, and immunodominant antigens from a disease. Antigen identification has
historically been very challenging for the immunology community, and we are confident that our
approach is a significant breakthrough in the field. Next, we use these antigens to identify tens of
thousands of T-cell receptors from T cells expanded in response to the virus across the human
population. This computational challenge requires the scale of data generation and processing
made possible by the Adaptive and Microsoft partnership.
In parallel, we will identify and confirm the TCR signature of the immune response to the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. TCR signatures will be identified in DNA extracted from peripheral or

whole blood samples from approximately 1000 patients with COVID-19. The immune signature
of COVID-19 we expect to identify is a starting point to solve key public health challenges in the
present. These samples can either be obtained from newly diagnosed patients or from patients
who have already recovered from the virus because the immune response will still be identifiable in
the memory compartment.
III.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

The primary aim is to improve our understanding of the immune system response in coronavirus
diseases by assaying the peripheral immune repertoire of TCRs and secondarily of BCRs,
specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes
COVID-19, with the potential to develop better diagnostic tests and treatments.
Adaptive and Microsoft are committed to making TCR repertoire data publicly available to
researchers around the world. We hypothesize that by studying the immune response in patients
with COVID-19 and making these data public, we can help solve several key challenges
plaguing this current pandemic.
Specific Aims
Aim 1. Comparison of disease-specific TCR signatures in patients and controls
We will run immunoSEQ on approximately 1000 patient samples with disease status unblinded.
After sequencing these samples, we will quantitatively describe the compartment of the T-cell
repertoire specific for the disease of interest. We will then use these data to construct a classifier
that accurately distinguishes patients from controls.
Aim 2. Identify the immunodominant antigens that elicit a T-cell response to COVID-19
We have developed technology to query the antigen specificity of the T-cell repertoire against
hundreds of peptide epitopes in a single blood sample5. This technology not only allows us to
parse out immunodominant epitopes of a given infection from irrelevant epitopes, but also allows
us to determine the TCR sequences of the T cells responding to these immunodominant epitopes.
We will use this technology to determine which peptide epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2
genome commonly elicit an immunodominant T-cell response in different samples. The TCR
sequence data generated from these studies will be used to boost the diagnostic classifier
obtained in Aim 1. In addition, the identification of immunodominant epitopes can be
disseminated to optimize studies in vaccine design and understanding the relationship between
antigen-specific T-cell responses and clinical outcomes in other labs.
Aim 3. Risk stratification based on an individual’s immune signature
There is a critical need for a reliable risk stratification test to enable treatment prioritization
given the potentially massive number of symptomatic patients. Despite an emerging
understanding of the diagnosis of COVID-19, how it spreads, and the death rate, there is
currently no available means to predict who needs hospitalization beyond age-associated risk and

limited epidemiologically-linked comorbidities. We aim to utilize the immune signature as a way
to predict disease severity in individuals by utilizing T-cell sequencing capabilities and machine
learning pipelines to identify T cells specific to the virus and assessing the strength of the
immune response by the expansion of these T cells in a patient’s blood. By understanding the
strength and specificity of a patient’s immune response, which may be temporarily bolstered by
recent exposure to other coronaviruses (e.g., common cold) in some people, we may be able to
significantly improve the diagnostic and risk stratification processes.
Aim 4. Determine whether an immune signature can be detected in individuals exposed to
SARS-CoV-2 earlier than currently available tests
Another critical need to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is to determine the false negative
rate of the RNA test in asymptomatic people and offer an alternative diagnostic that is more
sensitive in this cohort. For example, it is possible that early-stage disease is not picked up by
RNA tests because the virus may be isolated to regions such as the lower respiratory cavity that
are not assessed by standard testing methods. We aim to determine whether the immune response
can be used to detect the virus from a simple blood test, thereby providing a more sensitive test
in asymptomatic people, even if the virus itself is not directly detectable in the upper respiratory
region.
Secondary Aim:
Aim 5. Explore whether additional research assays could potential identify and/or confirm
antigenic binding
As a secondary aim, Adaptive will perform exploratory research with additional sequencing-based
research assays to profile the adaptive immune system, including, but not limited to, TCR pairSEQ**6
and B-cell receptor (BCR) pairSEQ††. These assays use a combinatorial method for pairing TCR
alpha and beta chain sequences and BCR heavy and light chain sequences. The output is a large set
of full-length, paired BCR or TCR sequences, which allows reconstruction of a functional antibody
or TCR. We regularly utilize the results of our pairSEQ assays to identify and/or confirm antigenic
binding. For the case of BCR pairSEQ, the resulting antibody sequences could potentially have
therapeutic value for imparting passive immunity.

will quantitatively describe the compartment of the T-cell repertoire specific for the disease of
interest compared to controls. Additional research assays may be applied.
Depending on the needs of the study, Adaptive will coordinate phlebotomist blood draws that
will be transported the same day at room temperature for processing. These samples must be
processed and cryopreserved within 6 hours of the sample blood draw. Both PBMCs and serum
will be processed and frozen. Samples prioritized for these procedures will include, but are not
limited to, those from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease and
reporting symptoms for at least two weeks prior to blood draw.
Nose or Throat Swabs
Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected by inserting a swab into the nose or
throat of the participant. Collected samples will be shipped frozen at -80 °C to Adaptive within 1
month of collection or stored at 4 °C and transported to Adaptive within 72 hours. All samples
will be stored at -80°C until further testing is performed. Testing may include, but is not limited
to, clinically available tests for coronavirus disease or other respiratory illnesses.
Electronic Questionnaire
An electronic questionnaire will be administered in this study to collect information pertaining to
the participant’s medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests performed for coronavirus
disease. This information will be used in the analysis to better understand and interpret the test
results. Responses will be stored and labeled with an alphanumeric code. All information will be
de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards.
As part of this study, medical records, with the participant’s consent, may be accessed to confirm
medical information pertaining the participant’s medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic tests
performed for coronavirus disease.
Optional Participation
Participants will have the option to undergo up to four additional blood draws and four additional
questionnaires about the participant’s symptoms and medical information relating to coronavirus
disease over a 2-month time period. Each additional blood draw will be approximately 10–60
mL (1–6  10-mL tube(s)). Optional blood draws are at the discretion of the investigator and
dependent on the needs of the study.
Additional tests to diagnose or support the diagnosis may be run on samples from participants
enrolled in all cohorts. This possibility is explicitly stated in the consenting information sheet.
Shipping
Batches of samples can be transported to Adaptive by courier. All sample shipments will follow
regulations for UN 3373 Biological Substance, Category B. Shipment notification and the
electronic manifest should be provided before sample receipt at Adaptive.

Data Analysis
Data analysis will be performed by Adaptive Biotechnologies scientists using customized
molecular assays and software designed to capture detailed information about the immune
repertoire. In collaboration with Microsoft, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) will
be used to construct a classifier that accurately distinguishes cases from controls based on TCR
repertoire analysis . A rigorous statistical analysis will be performed.
For the secondary aim, TCR pairSEQ and/or BCR pairSEQ assay analysis will be performed.
These analyses are based on a combinatorial method for pairing TCR alpha and beta chain
sequences and BCR heavy and light chain sequences, allowing reconstruction of a functional
antibody or TCR.
This study is considered minimal risk and does not require additional data monitoring measures.
Immunodominant peptide analysis
Cryopreserved PBMC will be used for the assay, which will link TCR sequences to T-cell
specificity of peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2 genome as described by Klinger et al.5.
Briefly, memory T cells from SARS-CoV-2–exposed individuals will be incubated with epitopes
derived from the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2–specific memory T cells will be
isolated and sequenced. The TCR sequences of the memory response will be used to broaden the
diagnostic signal obtained by repertoire analysis alone. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 antigenic
epitopes that are found to be immunogenic in participants who have cleared the infection will be
identified and shared with the community to facilitate further studies targeting these epitopes.

RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT

Risk Category: Minimal
Potential Risk - Physical
Physical risks associated with drawing blood include: soreness at the site of puncture, bruising,
and in the rare case, infection of the blood draw site, fainting, nerve, or tendon damage.
Physical risks associated with a nose or throat swab include: a very small risk of bleeding when
swabbing the inside of the nose or throat (mucosal membranes).
Mitigating strategies to minimize risk:
Standard procedures will be used to minimize discomfort and the chance of infection resulting
from venipuncture, nasal, or throat swabs.
Potential Risk – Loss of Confidentiality
There may be a risk of loss of confidentiality of the protected health information of the
participants.
Mitigating strategies to minimize risk:
All data and blood samples from participants will be de-identified at Adaptive in accordance
with the HIPAA Safe Harbor Method. In addition, staff sign confidentiality agreements as
conditions of their employment and are trained annually on the HIPAA Privacy and Security
Rule. Delegated research staff will be able to view information about the participant, the code
given their samples, and the resulting data derived from the analysis. Therefore, appropriate data
security measures will be in place to prevent unauthorized access to individually identifiable
data.
