Abstract

29

Objectives: We used viral genomics to deeply analyze the first SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in the

30

metropolitan region of Hamburg, Germany. Epidemiological analysis and contact tracing together with

31

a thorough investigation of virus variant patterns revealed low and high infection dose transmissions to

32

be involved in transmission events.

33

Methods: Infection control measures were applied to follow up contract tracing. Metagenomic RNA-

34

and SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing was performed from 25 clinical samples for sequence analysis

35

and variant calling.

36

Results: The index patient acquired SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and after his return to Hamburg transmitted

37

it to 2 out of 132 contacts. Virus genomics and variant pattern clearly confirms the initial local cluster.

38

We identify frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 23403 and 28881

39

previously described in Italian sequences and now considered as one major genotype in Europe. While

40

the index patient showed a single nucleotide polymorphism only one variant was transmitted to the

41

recipients. Different to the initial cluster, we observed in household clusters occurring at the time in

42

Hamburg also intra-host viral species transmission events.

43

Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing highlights both, low infection dose transmissions suggestive

44

of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in

45

family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes. This suggests (1) single viral

46

particle infection can be sufficient to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) household/family members

47

are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:

57

SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in late 2019 as the alleged cause of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases in

58

Wuhan (1). The virus and its associated disease, COVID-19 have since given rise to a worldwide

59

pandemic. Significant findings addressing epidemiology, containment measures, transmission dynamics

60

and course of the disease have been published worldwide in short intervals. However, questions with

61

regard to the infectivity of the virus, how many viral particles are sufficient for infection, are droplets

62

or fomites the predominant transmission routes, still need to be addressed in more detail.

63

Viral sequence data were immediately publically available and online tools such as GISAID provided

64

graphical interfaces for phylogenetic network analyses (1-6). Viral genomics can further be used to

65

deepen our understanding of infection routes and viral sequence variability, which might be contributing

66

to the clinical course of the disease.

67

Previous reports suggest frequent human-to-human transmission together with a wide range of clinical

68

severity, including patients showing mild or no symptoms with at the same time high concentrations of

69

viral RNA detectable in respiratory samples (7-9).

70

Interestingly, a recent report describes the dynamics of viral shedding and transmissibility of SARS-

71

CoV-2 with more than 44% of transmission occurring prior to symptom onset and viral loads peaking

72

before or at the time of symptom onset (10). This implies that not only health care workers need adequate

73

protection due to more frequent contact with infected patients (with high viral load) but especially

74

household/family members are at high risk due to high exposure and close contact.

75

While the viral load effect on incidence of infection and severity of the disease is currently discussed,

76

however, infecting dose measurements are highly challenging and can only be adequately addressed in

77

animal models.

78

We here use viral genomics and variant calling to follow up viral transmission in the initial COVID-19

79

cluster in Hamburg and other small household clusters occurring at the time in travel returnees in

80

Hamburg. We show here for the first time using viral variant tracing that low infection dose and high

81

infection dose transmissions contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Overall by analysing 25 clinical

82

samples using viral genomics and variant analysis we find evidence for both, intra-host variant

Methods

87

Patients

88

The index patient is a physician in his 60s with no underlying diseases. 10d past his initial SARS-CoV-

89

2 positive PCR test he was precautionary admitted to a hospital for 4 days where a chest-CT scan showed

90

characteristic ground-glass opacities (supplementary figure S1).

91

Patient 1, a male laboratory worker in his late 40s, with type II diabetes and high BMI. He developed

92

severe symptoms with dry cough, muscle pain, high fever and acute respiratory distress syndrome

93

(ARDS) with ICU admission and ECMO treatment.

94

Patient 2, a relative of patient 0 living in the same household, in her 60s, no comorbidities known,

95

developed a mild cough 3d after initial testing. She never developed other symptoms of COVID-19

96

disease (supplementary Tables S2-3).

97

Additional 20 oropharyngeal samples were collected between 1st and 8th of March 2020 during SARS-

98

CoV-2 outpatient testing at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, UKE, following the

99

Robert Koch Institute’s, RKI, recommendations at that time (individuals with respiratory symptoms

100

returning from countries/regions defined as high risk regions and/or individuals with contacts to

101

positively tested persons).

102

The local ethics committee of the City of Hamburg approved the study (PV7306). All studies were

103

carried out in keeping with local legal and regulatory requirements.

104
105

Epidemiological investigation

106

Contact persons of the index patient and patient 1 were identified by the UKE infection prevention and

107

control team together with public health officials. Classification of contacts is summarized in

108

supplementary Table S1. All employees with any contact were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the day of

109

confirmed infection of the index patient. Persons with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were sent to home

110

quarantine until the virus became undetectable and were closely monitored for symptom history.

111

Personnel with high-risk contacts were sent to home quarantine for 14 days and were tested at the end

112

of their quarantine. Employees with low risk contacts remained on duty and voluntary testing was

113

provided on day 7 after the last contact to the index patient.

115

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via RT-PCR in clinical samples

116

Oropharyngeal swabs were preserved in modified Amies medium (Copan E-swab, Copan, Italy).

117

Respiratory samples, serum, urine and stool samples were taken without additives, 1:1 mixed with

118

Roche PCR Media kit buffer (Roche, USA). Screening PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed as

119

described previously (11, 12).

120
121

Cell culture and virus isolation

122

Vero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586) were propagated in DMEM containing 3% FCS, 1% Penicillin/

123

Streptomycin, 1 % L-Glutamine, 1 % Sodium pyruvate, 1 % non-essential amino acids (Gibco/ Thermo

124

Fisher, Waltham, USA) under standard culture conditions. For virus isolation, cells were washed with

125

PBS prior to infection with the native clinical material. After adsorption for 1h at 37°C, fresh DMEM

126

was added. Virus replication was assessed by RT-PCR.

127
128

Immunofluorescence assays

129

Assays were performed as described before (13, 14).

130
131

ELISA for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG

132

A commercially available ELISA for detection of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (Euroimmun, Lübeck,

133

Germany) was used on the Euroimmunanalyzer I (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany).

134
135

SARS-CoV-2 Amplicon Sequencing

136

SARS-Cov-2 amplicon sequencing was based on the nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol from the Artic

137

network project (artic.network/ncov-2019) with the following modifications. Reverse transcription was

138

performed in the presence of 2.4µM random primer mix (hexamer and anchored-dT primer (dT23VN))

After RNase H digestion multiplex PCR was performed using the primer scheme version 3 with 196

140

primers (supplementary Table S4) generating 400bp amplicons. Adaptor ligation for Illumina

141

compatible multiplex sequencing was achieved by using the NEBNext DNA Ultra II Library Prep Kit

142

and the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos (96 Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs; New England Biolabs).

143

Multiplex sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq, 500cycle MiSeq v2 kit (Illumina).

160

individual sample were included and annotated using ANNOVAR (22).Variants located in non-coding

161

regions or representing frameshift, stopgain or startloss were deleted. Data were clustered by hclust

Results

172

In February 2020 a physician (index patient) returned from Trentino, Italy, at this time, not defined as a

173

risk area for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (23). 2 days after his return, he developed symptoms of a cold,

174

stopped his duty and stayed in home quarantine together with a relative thereafter. He was laboratory

175

confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive (Figure 1).

176

During these 2 days patient 0 had contact with 131 persons at the workplace. Out of these, 33 were high

177

risk (category I) and 98 were low risk contacts (category II). These contacts and a relative of patient 0

178

were tested negative on February 28th. One high risk workplace contact (patient 1) who had two contacts

179

with Patient 0 developed symptoms 3d later and was subsequently tested positive. Similarly, a relative

180

of patient 0 (patient 2) was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at that time. All other high risk contacts,

181

retested at day 7 (n=17) and/or at day 14 (n=28) after the last contact with patient 0 stayed SARS-CoV-

182

2 negative. 40 low risk contacts were tested negative at day 7 after the last contact with patient 0.

183
184

SARS-CoV-2 infection course in the patients belonging to the index cluster

185

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was monitored by RT-PCR in respiratory specimens from patients 0 - 2 at

186

different time points of infection. High viral loads were observed in all three patients early in the

187

infection, independent of clinical symptoms (Figure 1, Tables S2-S3). In patients 0 and 2 the viral loads

188

declined 1000-fold and 200-fold, respectively, within a 5 day period following the first day of positivity

189

(Figure 1). In the critically ill patient 1, however, viral loads declined only 8-fold and remained high

190

over a prolonged time period. Furthermore, while on ECMO treatment, he also showed moderate viral

191

loads in the serum, suggesting a systemic viral infection (Table S3).

192

Interestingly, from an oropharyngeal swab of patient 2, who stayed asymptomatic, infectious SARS-

193

CoV-2 could be successfully propagated in cell culture (24) suggestive of active viral replication. This

194

is furthermore supported by our data obtained from RNA shotgun sequencing, in which we detect reads

195

spanning the SARS-CoV-2 leader sequence and regions of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Table 1).

196

All three patients seroconverted (Figure 1, Table S3), within 10- 14 d after the first positive PCR report.

197
198

SARS-CoV-2 variant calling allows geographic viral origin analysis and contact tracing

199

Since we did not obtain high virus coverage by shotgun sequencing over the complete SARS-CoV-2

200

genome in all samples, we performed SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing. This allowed us to thoroughly

201

characterize viral genomes, confirm the relationship of the viral sequences and identify possible

202

sequence variants. We obtained coverage of more than 98% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes included

203

(n=25) with 23 samples showing >99.5% coverage, the maximum coverage of amplicon sequencing,

204

due to primer positioning at the very 5’ and 3’ ends. We identified 37 sequence variants, with 26 variants

205

not used for clade or genotype assignment and 9 variants not represented in the GISAID database (Figure

206

2). Overall, mutations within the nucleotide sequence were relatively rare. We find between 2 to 12

207

consensus level variants per sample and only few, 1-2, sub-consensus variants occurring in 30% of the

208

samples. Based on the observed SNPs we can clearly cluster the sequences in distinct variant patterns,

209

pattern I, II (II.1-II.4) and III (Figure 2). The clustering is driven by the presence of few SNPs, frequently

210

found in SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These were described e.g. in the leader sequence, position 241 co-

211

occurring with mutations within the nsp3 (nt 3037), RNApol (nt 14408) and spike protein (nt 23403).

212

These co-occurring mutations have been recently described as one major SARS-CoV-2 variant

213

occurring in Europe and suggested to be defined as genotype II (6). The earliest representative of this

214

prevalent SNP pattern in GISAID (3, 25) is in an Italian sequence (Italy/CDG1/2020/412973) entered

215

on February 20th. We identified these mutations in one cluster of related infections from persons

216

returning from a weekend of clubbing in Berlin (Figure 2, pattern II.1). In addition to these 4 core

217

variants additional frequent variants are known and here described as sub-clusters of cluster II. Cluster

218

II.2 is defined by an additional frequent mutation of three consecutive bases in the nucleocapsid

219

phosphoprotein, nt 28,881 resulting in two aa changes. This SNP is described in approximately 25% of

220

sequences in GISAID with its first description on February 24th, Netherlands/Berlicum_1363564/2020.

221

Sequences isolated from our index patient, patient 1 and 2 are clustering in pattern II.2. The sequences

222

are highly related defined by an additional SNP at position 160, a variant not described in any sequence

223

currently deposited in any database (3, 25). Thus, the mutation at position 160 in combination with the

224

anamnestic data and the chronological development of test positivity in the three patients, proves that

225

patient 1 and -2 acquired SARS-CoV-2 from patient 0.

226

Interestingly, we identify a unique mutation acquired in patient 1, nt 2393 within orf1ab resulting in an

227

aa substitution Val to Phe at position 710 in the non-structural protein nsp2 (Table 2). The nsp2 protein

228

shows relatively little conservation across coronaviruses and is dispensable for replication in vitro (26).

229

However, recent reports suggest that nsp2 can modulate the host cell environment, including

230

transcriptional processes (27).

231

Cluster II.3 separates from cluster II.2 with the presence of one additional SNP at nt27046 within the

232

coding region of the membrane glycoprotein. Pattern II.4 is mainly defined by the SNPs at positions

233

241, 1059, 3037, 14408, 15380, 23403 and 25563. It is less frequent and has been first reported in a

234

sequence from France (France/HF1465/2020) on February 21st. Cluster III (rarely identified) is

235

characterized by two SNPs at positions 1440 and 2891. It was first reported in a sequence from Germany

236

(Germany/NRW/02-1/2020) on February 25th. Finally, pattern I is clearly distinct; this sequence shows

237

12 SNPs with six of them being previously, February 26th, reported in a sequence identified in Norway

238

(Norway/1380/2020), Figure 2B. The SNP at nt 11962 has been rarely reported with its first description

239

in the sequence Wuhan/HBCDC-HB-05/20/20 on January 18th. It was recently suggested as being

240

indicative of genotype I (6).

241
242

Sub-consensus SARS CoV-2 variant calling reveals intra-host transmissions

243

We used paired end amplicon sequencing data for variant calling and to define minority sequences

244

variants, so called sub-consensus viral populations. Of the 37 nucleotide positions with SNPs, we find

245

at 14 positions sub-consensus variants: leader region (nts 160 and 199), leader protein (nt 635), nsp2 (nt,

246

2658), nsp3 (nts 5183 and 5284), nsp6 (nts 11083, 11438), nsp10 (nt 13115), RNA polymerase (nt

247

14217), RNA helicase (nt 16726), S (nt 23939), M (nt 27046) and TM (nt 27900). Most of these variants

248

result in non-synonymous mutations with the exception of the variants at nts 5284, 13115 and 14217

249

causing synonymous mutations.

250

Interestingly, we identified three sequence clusters in which we can follow transmission events based

251

on the presence/absence of minority sequences at specific nucleotide positions. Within the first cluster

252

we detected patient 0 carrying a sub-consensus variation at position 160 in the leader region. The two

253

recipients, patient 1 and 2, both carry only one variant at position 160, in both cases G (Var) instead of

254

A (Ref). Considering the index patient showing a variant fraction of 0.5 at position 160 this is highly

255

indicative of low dose viral infection in both transmission events. Similarly, in another family cluster

256

(cluster II.4), patients P21, P22 and P48, we observed only one position with multiple variants, position

257

199. Observed variant fractions are highly suggestive of a low viral dose exposure from P22 or P48 to

258

P21. Interestingly, we observed the transmission of intra-host variants at position 199 from patient P22

259

to P48 (or vice versa) being indicative of high viral load exposure and transmission. Furthermore, we

260

observed the transmission of intra-host variants in a second household cluster, two families returning

261

from a joint vacation. P06, P09 and P10, which are members of one family, are showing intra-host

262

variants at position 11438 indicative of high infection dose exposure being involved in viral

263

transmission. While P09 shows a variant fraction of 0.5 at position 11438, P06 and P10 both have a

264

variant fraction of 0.2. While we cannot make any conclusions on the order of the infection events,

265

however, the presence of identical minority sequence variants in these three patients is highly indicative

266

of high-infection dose transmission between these family members or between the initial sources of the

267

infection and all three family members. Overall, the presence of identical minority sequence is highly

268

suggestive of high viral load exposure occurring in household/family environment.

269
270

No clinically relevant viral or bacterial co-infections in respiratory samples

271

We performed unbiased metagenomic RNA sequencing from respiratory specimens of the 25 patients

272

included to detect putative viral and bacterial co-infections (Tables 3, S4-S6).

273

Besides SARS-CoV-2 sequences, no other viral sequences known to be associated with respiratory

274

infections were identified. Furthermore, the identified bacterial sequences in all cases clearly reflected

275

a commensal bacterial flora typical for the oropharyngeal tract. We closely monitored the samples of

276

the index cluster in which we sampled longitudinal respiratory samples of the course of the infection.

While we did not observe significant overrepresentation of sequences indicative of bacterial co10

infections in the patients 0 or 2, an early throat swap sample from patient 1 exhibited a high proportion

279

of sequences assigned to Moraxella catharralis and Staphylococcus aureus (24.56% and 19.55%

280

relative abundance, respectively). However, tracheal secretion and BAL fluid from patient 1 at later time

281

points (under ICU treatment) did not find evidence for persistent bacterial co-infection with Moraxella

282

catharrhalis or any other pathogen known as a cause for respiratory infection (Table 3).

Discussion

286

This work describes the first SARS-CoV-2 positive patient in Northern Germany, documents the tracing

287

of all its contacts and describes the subsequent infection cluster. Thorough epidemiological, clinical,

288

virological and metagenomic analyses of the patients in this first cluster together with 20 SARS-CoV-2

289

samples from family and household clusters occurring subsequently in the same geographic area,

290

revealed a number of important insights into transmission, clinical course and molecular epidemiology

291

of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.

292

First, based on comparative SNP analysis using 20 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from our study and

293

sequences available in the GISAID database, we identify different virus variant patterns, which allow

294

us to conclude on transmission routes. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the index patient occurred

295

only to two out of 132 contact persons with whom prolonged and unprotected interaction took place.

296

Although we detected mutations between different patient’s samples the overall frequency was relatively

297

low. Our observation is different to a recent report in which high frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations

298

was described (28). Differences can be explained by the relatively conservative variant calling approach

299

in our analysis with variant frequency >33% being reported compared to 5% variant frequency as cut-

300

off in the recently published report. Similar to previous reports, we did not find any mutation hot-spot

301

genes in our analysis.

302

Within the initial cluster (patient 0, 1 and 2), we identify a single non-synonymous mutation gained in

303

the prevalent virus sequence recovered from patient 1. This mutation has not been described before and

304

results in an aa substitution at position 710 of the non-structural protein nsp2. While we have no

305

indication that this aa substitution has functional consequences for viral replication or host interaction,

306

it is interesting that nsp2 is dispensable in vitro and not very well conserved between coronaviruses.

307

Interestingly, mutations within nsp2 have been described (26, 29, 30) suggesting a more stable nsp2

308

protein and thereby contributing to higher pathogenicity (29).

309

Second, to our knowledge we describe the first report of intra-host variant transmissions of SARS-CoV-

310

2 in patients. We report low dose and high dose transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurring in

311

family/household clusters. In our initial cluster, we observe only low dose viral transmission occurring

312

at the workplace and in the household, respectively. However, in two family clusters in the early

313

epidemic in Hamburg, we observe transmissions of minority sequence variants between household

314

members indicative of high viral load/droplet exposure. While we cannot draw any conclusion on

315

infection dose and disease outcome (e.g. since in the initial cluster the severity of clinical symptoms was

316

independent of viral loads early in infection), our study shows for the first time that in settings of

317

household clusters transmission of minority virus variants occur, which is indicative of high infection

318

dose transmissions by droplets. Our data suggest that (1) low infection dose is sufficient for establishing

319

a SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) close contacts, household members are at high risk to SARS-CoV-2

320

infection similar to healthcare workers if not taking appropriate protection measurements.
