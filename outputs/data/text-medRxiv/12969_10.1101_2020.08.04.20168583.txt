Abstract
Objectives: To investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine
whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs,

and how they change over time.

Study design: Prospective national longitudinal community online survey.
Setting: Australian general public.
Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362 baseline/Wave 1; n=1882 Wave 2; n=1369
Wave 3).

Main outcome measure: COVID-19 misinformation beliefs.
Results: Stronger agreement with misinformation beliefs was significantly associated with
younger age, male gender, lower education, and primarily speaking a language other than

English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs

were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived

threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific

institutions. The belief that the threat of COVID-19 is “greatly exaggerated” increased

between Wave 1-2 (p=0.002), while belief that herd immunity benefits were being covered

up decreased (p<0.001). Greatest support from a list of Australian Government identified

myths was for those regarding ‘hot temperatures killing the virus’ (22%) and ‘Ibuprofen

exacerbates COVID-19’ (13%). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official

government accounts were associated with greater support for COVID-19 myths after

controlling for sociodemographic variables.

Conclusion: These findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness.
Stronger endorsement of misinformation was associated with male gender, younger age,

undermine public health efforts. Public health authorities must urgently target groups

identified in this study when countering misinformation and seek ways to enhance public

trust of experts, governments, and institutions.

False, misleading or inaccurate health information can pose a serious risk to public health

and public action. Misinformation about COVID-19 is common and has spread rapidly across

the globe through social media platforms and other information systems.[1-4] In February,

the World Health Organisation’s Director-General declared the global ‘over-abundance’ of

COVID-19 information an ‘infodemic’.[5] The term ‘misinfodemic’ has since been coined to

capture the corresponding rise in misinformation surrounding the virus.

COVID-19 misinformation – which is typically compelling, persuasive, and emotive – spreads

significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than factual information on social

media platforms [6]. This is particularly true within tight-knit communities, as has been seen

with the spread of vaccine misinformation among some communities in the United States

and Sweden. [7-9] Common COVID-19 beliefs circulating in mainstream media include

framing of the pandemic as a leaked bioweapon, a consequence of 5G wireless technology,

a political hoax, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has been made up by governments to

control people. Others detail ineffective measures that individuals can take to prevent or

treat the virus, such as exposing themselves to sunlight or taking vitamin C. [10]

Misinformation can undermine public health efforts through shaping beliefs and attitudes -

particularly if encountered within a social network - and by reinforcing pre-existing values

and positions [11]. Importantly, lower perceived risk or perceived efficacy of prevention

behaviours and altered perception of social norms might influence willingness to follow

recommendations, such as voluntary testing, isolation and, potentially, vaccination [12].

Understanding what the public know about COVID-19 and identifying beliefs based on

misinformation can help shape effective public health communications to ensure efforts to

reduce viral transmission are not undermined.

This paper uses data from a longitudinal cohort study of the Australian public to: a)

investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation in this sample and examine

whether any demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these

beliefs, and b) investigate how these misinformation beliefs change over time.

Methods
Design
The data used in this study are from a prospective longitudinal national survey exploring

variation in understanding, attitudes, and uptake of COVID-19 health advice during the 2020

pandemic lockdown[13, 14]. A total of 4362 participants completed the baseline survey

(Wave 1), recruited in Australia in April 2020 (17-24

th

). This survey was administered one

month after the first measures of physical distancing and quarantine measures were

introduced in Australia and when an increasing number of COVID-19 cases were being

recorded. A subset (n=3214) of the sample were invited for longitudinal follow-up to assess

changes in attitudes, beliefs and behaviour over the course of the pandemic. Wave 2 of the

study (n=1882, 59% response rate) was administered in May (8-15

th

), 3 weeks after the

baseline (Wave 1) survey. Wave 3 of the study (n=1369, 43% response rate) was

administered in June (5-12

th

), approximately 6 weeks after the baseline survey, when

restrictions in Australia showed signs of easing and new case numbers and reported

community transmission had fallen dramatically. Wave 3 was administered prior to the

resurgence of cases in some areas of Australia.

Participants and recruitment
Participants were recruited via advertisement on social media (i.e. Facebook, Instagram)

and by a market research company (Dynata). Those recruited on social media were invited

for longitudinal follow-up. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, currently living

in Australia, and able to read and understand English. Participants recruited via Dynata

received points for completing the survey which can be redeemed for gift vouchers,

donations to charities, or cash. Participants recruited via social media were given the

opportunity to enter into a prize draw for the chance to win one of ten $20 gift cards upon

completion of each survey wave.

Ethics approval
Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of The University

of Sydney (2020/212). Completion and submission of the online questionnaire was

considered evidence of consent.

Measures
The survey was built and administered online using Qualtrics (SAP, Provo, UT). Survey items

included in each wave were modified from the national longitudinal study [13] to reflect

psychological, behavioural, and knowledge factors considered most relevant at that stage of

restrictions. Relevant measures for this study are detailed in Table 1. Age, gender,

reduce the number of outcomes for analysis, misinformation beliefs at baseline were

combined into a single measure using principal component analysis (PCA). Associations

between the extracted misinformation component and possible explanatory variables were

explored using truncated linear regression controlling for sociodemographic factors

previously shown to be associated with misinformation beliefs [13].

Changes in misinformation beliefs across study waves were examined using linear mixed

models with random intercepts by participant and robust standard errors. Due to changes in

the items included in each wave, these items were analysed individually.

Dimension reduction using PCA was applied to the 10 specific COVID-19 myth items

(included in Wave 3 of the study). Multivariable truncated regression models were used to

examine associations with the extracted components, using the same explanatory variables

as for the analysis of misinformation beliefs from Wave 1. Where survey items were

repeated in Wave 3 (i.e. perceived threat of COVID-19, confidence in government, and use

of social media as a “top 3” information source), this version of the variable was included;

otherwise the response at baseline was carried forward (i.e. digital health literacy,

institutional trust, and sociodemographic variables). An additional explanatory variable

added in Wave 3 (rejection of official accounts) was also included in these models.

Misinformation beliefs and associations with sociodemographic, cognitive and
psychosocial variables (Wave 1)
One month into lockdown in Australia, 753 (17.3%) participants agreed that data about the

effectiveness of vaccines is often made up; 652 (15.0%) agreed that that herd immunity

would be beneficial for COVID-19 but this is covered up; 603 (13.8%) agreed that the threat

of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated; and 595 (13.6%) agreed that the Australian government

restrictions are stronger than required. Responses on these items were moderately

correlated (pairwise

r’s

between 0.36 and 0.63), with good internal consistency (Cronbach’s

α= 0.78) and sufficient sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.76). PCA of these items resulted in the

extraction of a single component accounting for 60.7% of the variance (component loadings

provided in Appendix Table 1).

speaking a language other than English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these

variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital

health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and

lower trust in scientific institutions.

Changes in misinformation beliefs over time
Prevalence of agreement with misinformation by study wave is shown in Table 4, which

appear to be generally consistent over time. Linear mixed models identified a main effect of

time (p=0.006), with pairwise contrasts showing an increase in the belief that the threat of

COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated between Wave 1 and Wave 2 (Item 3; mean difference

[MD] = 0.079, 95%CI: 0.030, 0.128, p=0.002). There was a decrease in the belief that herd

immunity is beneficial for COVID-19, but is covered up, between Wave 1 and Wave 2 (Item

2; MD = -0.130, 95%CI: -0.189, -0.071, p<0.001). There was no difference across time for

Item 4 (strength of government restrictions; p=0. 41).

component solution which cumulatively accounted for 51.15% of the variance (see

Appendix Table 2 for component loading and proportion agreeing with each item);

examination of the contributing items to each component resulted in the following 3 labels:

1.

Symptom management and prevention myths (PC1; explaining 18.9% of the total

variance)

2.

Causes and transmission myths (PC2; explaining 16.7% of the total variance); and

3.

Immunity and cure myths (PC3; explaining 15.6% of the total variance).

Regarding specific myths concerning

symptom management and prevention,

301 (22%) of

the Wave 3 sample (n=1369) agreed that hot temperatures kill the virus, 295 (21.5%) agreed

that UV rays kill the virus, and 179 (13.1%) agreed that Ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19

(see Appendix Table 2). Greater support for symptom management and prevention myths

(PC1) was significantly associated with younger age and male gender; and after controlling

for demographics (age, gender, education and LOTE) was associated with lower institutional

trust and greater rejection of official accounts (PC1; see Table 5).

For myths regarding

causes and transmission,

167 (12.2%) of the sample agreed the COVID-

19 virus was engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan, 57 (4.2%)

agreed that parcels from China can spread the virus, and only 8 (0.6%) agreed that 5G

networks are spreading the virus. Causes and transmission myths (PC2) were significantly

associated with less education and more social disadvantage. Greater belief in these myths

was associated with lower digital health literacy, reduced perceived public threat, reduced

institutional trust, and greater rejection of official accounts after controlling for

sociodemographic variables (PC2; see Table 5).

Regarding myths about

effective treatment, 55 (4.0%) agreed there is a cure/vaccine for COVID-19, 32 (2.3%)

agreed Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment, and 15 (1.1%) agreed the flu shot

provides immunity. Greater support for immunity and cure myths (PC3) was significantly

associated with younger age. After controlling for sociodemographic factors, lower digital

health literacy, reduced perceived public threat, reduced institutional trust, and greater

rejection of official accounts were associated with greater belief in these myths (PC3; see

Discussion
Our findings showed lower institutional trust, lower digital health literacy, and greater
rejection of official accounts were associated with stronger support of misinformation
beliefs. Misbeliefs were also more common among those who primarily spoke a language
other than English at home, in younger age groups, and in males. The most commonly held
misinformation beliefs in this study concerned symptom management and prevention. We
found small changes between wave 1 and wave 2 on two of the beliefs: an increase in the
belief that COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated and a decrease in the belief that herd immunity
is beneficial for COVID-19 but is covered up. Despite these differences being statistically
significant, they likely have little to no practical importance (i.e., only a 0.08 and 0.12 unit
change respectively on a 7-point scale). Notably, the proportion of participants agreeing
with each item remained generally consistent over time.
The study was large and diverse but not representative of the national population. Given
this, caution is needed in generalising from the prevalence findings. However, we have
identified factors associated with misinformation beliefs and trends over time for some
variables.
Our rates of COVID-19 misinformation beliefs were lower when compared internationally
[21] [22]. An Australian poll conducted in May 2020 found relatively high support (12-77%)
for misinformation beliefs relating to the creation, spread, and prevention of the virus [23].
Interestingly, we saw a much lower prevalence of people agreeing that 5G networks are
spreading the virus when compared with the Essential Research findings.

The poll found similar demographic patterns to our findings, where men and younger
people agreed with a range of COVID-19 myths more than other groups. In the US and UK,
younger people are more likely to hold conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 [24] [25].
American men are more likely to agree with COVID-19 conspiracy theories than women
[26].
The association between misinformation beliefs and lower education, language other than
English, younger age and male gender point to important gaps in public health messaging to
these groups. We have previously highlighted these disparities [14] and the complexity of
government health information about COVID-19. In our previous analysis we found that
some of these groups (people with less education, language other than English) had poorer
understanding of COVID-19 symptoms and were less able to identify behaviours to prevent
infection. Recent attention has focused on the importance of reaching people who do not
speak English as a first language [27]. Our study further highlights the need for health
information to be written to meet diverse health literacy requirements and targeted to
specific groups. Young people should be involved in the design of COVID-19 messages to get
the tone and delivery right. This can be done through end user testing, consumer focus
groups, and including young people on communication teams.
Provision of quality information online is unlikely to be a sufficient strategy to counter the
influence of misinformation if digital health literacy is not accounted for. Messaging and
debunking must be delivered on multiple channels, consistent in content and style, and
conveyed in local languages to ensure engagement with all communities. [28] Emerging
evidence supports the idea that prebunking or ‘innoculating’ people against misinformation
can build resistance to misinformation across cultures. [29] Going forward, it will be

important to invest in programs teaching digital health literacy and healthy scepticism of
health news. Finally, partnerships between public health authorities and trusted
organisations to deliver information and correct misinformation should be utilised where
possible. [30] Corrective messages are most successful when they offer a coherent
explanation for how and why a belief based on misinformation is incorrect.[31] Research
shows that corrective information can counter misperceptions and improve belief accuracy
after a person’s exposure to misinformation.[32]
Timely, accurate and transparent messaging is vitally important to gaining public trust in
messaging from authorities ahead of other less credible sources [33]. While there is now
intense global interest aimed at limiting the spread of misinformation in the first place,[1,
29, 34] it will require ‘a sustained and coordinated effort by independent fact checkers,
independent news media, platform companies, trusted spokespeople and public authorities
to help the public understand and navigate the pandemic’.[35] Government health agencies
and news media are ideally positioned to successfully correct misbeliefs during public health
crises.[32]
Around the world and in Australia, anti-lockdown protests have taken place in capital cities,
with protesters voicing opposition to vaccination, telecommunication towers, and the
COVID ‘hoax’. Researchers have recently investigated the degree to which misinformation
about COVID-19 is associated with people’s willingness to adhere to public health
recommendations and government enforced measures and found that willingness
decreases significantly as the strength of misbeliefs increases,[36, 37] including decreased
COVID-19 vaccination intentions [38]. In some cases, misinformation has led to serious

harm, such as the Iranian methanol poisoning experience [39]. The spread of
misinformation is an ongoing area of concern as Australia and the world continue to live
with the fluctuating realities of a global pandemic. Correcting misinformation should be
viewed as a vitally important science and health policy activity.[40]

Strengths & limitations

This was a large and diverse sample of the Australian population and the longitudinal design
enabled us to look at whether misinformation beliefs changed over the course of the
pandemic. By design, the survey items changed across time, however this prevented us
from being able to calculate longitudinal changes in the principal component derived at
baseline. The sample was recruited via an online panel and social media, the majority were
well educated, with a low proportion of culturally and linguistically diverse participants. A
final limitation is the labelling of the misinformation items as these particular beliefs are
likely contextual and subjective.

Conclusion
These findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness. Misinformation can
undermine public health efforts. Public health authorities must urgently target groups
identified in this study when countering misinformation and seek ways to enhance public
trust of experts, governments, and institutions. Communicators must pay attention to
pitching COVID-19 messages at a level that most people can understand, and suitable and
relevant to diverse cultural groups, young people and particularly targeted to men.
