ABSTRACT
The lack of treatment options for COVID-19 has raised many concerns among populations
worldwide, which has led to many attempts to find alternative options to prevent the
transmission of the disease or to alleviate the progression of the infection, including focusing
more on preventive measures (to prevent transmission to other individuals) and the use of
natural products and herbal extracts to increase immunity and decrease the probability of
getting infected. This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the
consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258
individuals participated in this study. Participants’ knowledge about the appropriate COVID19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social
distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around
55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have
used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect
themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main
motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly
used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level
of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable
proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order
to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further
educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission
routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should be evidencebased to ensure patient safety.

1. Introduction
On December 31, 2019, several patients were admitted to the local hospitals of Wuhan,
China, with symptoms of pneumonia linked to a common infection in the wholesale market
in Wuhan. COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, and headache. In
addition to that, the transmission of the virus is noticed to be fast in direct or indirect
pathways, such as respiratory droplets, direct contact with an infected person, and on surfaces
and objects, which has led to more than 5 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and a death
rate that has exceeded 300,000 deaths (Rothan and Byrareddy 2020; Shereen et al. 2020;
World Health Organization 2020b; Liu et al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020a,
2020c). Researchers have compared the current COVID-19 pandemic to the Spanish flu that
occurred in 1918, which resulted in more than 50 million deaths around the world. In addition
to that, the rapid transmission rate and the lack of vaccinations or any treatment option for the
COVID-19 outbreak provoked the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International
Health Regulation (IHR) emergency committee to announce the case as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2019; Martini et al. 2019; Barry, Al Amri, and Memish 2020).
Alarmingly, the investigation reports indicated a new strain of coronavirus with unknown
aetiology that had spread globally, which forced the World Health Organization to declare it
a pandemic in March 2020. It was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Bogoch et
al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020f; Zhao et al. 2020; Lu, Stratton, and Tang 2020).
In March 2020, Saudi Arabia reported the first case of COVID-19, and the disease started to
spread increasingly throughout the whole country. As a consequence, in order to prevent the
rapid transmission of the infection, the Saudi government implemented multiple measures,
including restrictions in the educational sectors and broad restrictions in the transportation
sector (nationally and internationally). Subsequently, a general curfew was placed on the
residents and citizens of Saudi Arabia in an attempt to curtail the spread of the virus (Saudi
Ministry of Health 2020; Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control 2020). However,
the transmission of the disease dramatically increased and reached more than 145,000
confirmed COVID-19 cases in the kingdom by the 18th of June (Saudi Ministry of Health
2020).
The lack of treatment options for COVID-19 has raised many concerns among populations
worldwide, which has led to many attempts to find alternative options to prevent the
transmission of the disease or to alleviate the progression of the infection, including focusing

more on preventive measures (to prevent transmission to other individuals) and the use of
natural products and herbal extracts to increase immunity and decrease the probability of
getting infected (Austin, Martin, and Gregory 2007; Lake 2020; World Health Organization
2020a, 2020c; Salathe et al. 2020).
Historically, the use of natural products was known to be the only treatment method against
many infections and diseases. Also, natural products were used to enhance the immune
system and are still widely used nowadays, mainly without the need for a prescription [19,
20]. Regardless of the benefits of using herbal products, there is a significant disadvantage,
namely the herbal-drug interaction. Posadzki et al. (2013) reported the possible interactions
between herbal medicinal products and drugs, which they classified as minor, moderate, and
severe. Their study showed that, in some cases, the combination of herbal medicine and drugs
resulted in life-threatening conditions (Posadzki, Watson, and Ernst 2013). Unfortunately, a
recent report showed that about 80% of developed countries' populations still rely on herbal
medicines without any control (Pathak and Das 2013). Regarding COVID-19, many studies
have been conducted to investigate the ability of already-known antiviral herbal products to
treat it. In addition, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of this kind of medicine
among individuals who are afraid of contracting COVID-19, without taking into
consideration the possible harmful effects of some products (Ekor 2014). The objective of
this study is to explore the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of
herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection.

2. Methods
2.1.

Study design and study population

A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between May
23rd and June 06th, 2020. The survey instrument was developed based on extensive literature
reviews on the COVID-19 pandemic, including its transmission and preventive measures and
the use of traditional medicine (World Health Organization 2020e; Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2020; Luo et al. 2020). The questionnaire tool was reviewed by three
researchers to evaluate the appropriateness, relevancy, clarity, and adequacy of the questions.
The survey instrument included thirty-three questions, including socio-demographic
characteristics, history of chronic diseases, respondents’ adherence to the Ministry of Health
(MOH) instructions on COVID-19 pandemic preventive measures and social distancing, and
the use of herbal products and food supplements. The survey was divided into five major
sections. The first section had eight questions on the respondents’ sociodemographic
characteristics. The second section included two questions about having a history of chronic
diseases and whether the participant is currently/previously infected with COVID-19 (a yesno question). The third section contained five questions on participants’ knowledge about
COVID-19 preventive measures (specifically handwashing and social distancing). Each
question was given a score of two for each correct answer (a total of 10 for the whole
knowledge section). The total possible score could range between 0 – 10, and can be
interpreted based on the mid-point of the highest possible score of the scale (equal to 5). The
higher the score, the better the knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures.
The knowledge section was followed by a question asking the participants whether they
consider themselves committed to Saudi Ministry of Health recommendations regarding
COVID-19 prevention and transmission. The fourth section (17 questions) asked them about
their beliefs about herbal products and food supplements in terms of: 1) usage, 2) the source
of information about them and the source of supply, and 3) belief in the protective effects of
herbal products and food supplements as effective protection against COVID-19.
2.2.

Sampling strategy

A convenient sample of eligible participants was invited to participate in the study through
social media (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp). All participants
voluntarily participated in the study and were thus considered exempt from written informed
consent. The study aims and objectives were clearly explained at the beginning of the survey.

The inclusion criteria were: a) participants aged 18 years and above and currently
living in Saudi Arabia. Participants were excluded if they were: a) below 18 years of age; and
b) unable to understand the Arabic language.
2.3.

Sample size

Using a confidence interval of 95%, a standard deviation of 0.5, and a margin of error of 5%,
the required sample size was 385 participants.
2.4.

Statistical analysis

Data were analysed using SPSS software, version 25 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).
Continuous variables were reported as mean (± standard deviation [SD]), while categorical
variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov and
Shapiro Wilk tests were used to check the normality of the data. Participants' knowledge
scores were interpreted as a continuous scale based on the scale midpoint, where scores
above the midpoint represented better knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures.
Student t-test and one-way ANOVA test were used to compare the mean knowledge scores
between different demographic groups respectively. Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test was
conducted to identify the source of significant variation within each group. Additionally,
significant predictors of better knowledge were determined using multiple linear regression
analysis. A confidence interval of 95% (p<0.05) was applied to represent the statistical
significance of the results, and the level of significance was predetermined as 5%.
2.5.

Ethical considerations

This study was approved by the general directorate of health affairs – Al-Qassem Region,
Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia, registration No H-04-Q-001. As participation in the study
was voluntary, the research ethics committee approved the consent waiver.

Results

3.1.

Characteristics of study participants
A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. More than half (57.1%, n=

3,000) were females. Around 41.0% (n= 2,155) of the participants were aged 25 to 39 years.
The majority were married (60.3%, n= 3,169), Saudi (96.5%, n= 5,076), and living in central
provinces (58.0%, n= 3,048) of the Kingdom. More than half of them (60.0%, n= 3,155) were
bachelor degree holders, 45.4% (n= 2,387) were employed, and 34.3% (n= 1,803) have a
family member working in the healthcare provision sector. Around 14.5% (n= 760) of them
reported that they have a history of chronic disease and 0.6% (n= 30) reported that they had
been or were currently infected with COVID-19. When the participants were asked whether
they consider themselves committed to the Ministry of Health instructions regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic, 43.0% (n= 2,262) reported that they are completely committed and
32.0% (n= 1,685) reported that they are committed most of the time except in emergency
cases, refer to (Table 1).
3.2.

Participants’ knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures

Participants’ knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of
handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean
score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score).
The majority of the participants (90.1%, n= 4,736) agreed that washing hands with soap and
water reduces the spread of coronavirus. Only 24.3% (n= 1,277) of the participants knew that
handwashing should last at least 20 seconds, and 21.6% (n= 1,136) knew that there are five
main steps in washing one’s hands correctly. The majority of the participants (95.9%, n=
5,044) reported that their commitment to staying at home and away from gatherings
contributes to reducing COVID-19 transmission. However, only 40.1% (n= 2,107) of them
were aware of the appropriate physical social distance (which is a minimum of one metre)
required to prevent COVID-19 transmission.

Participants’ demographics and their knowledge about COVID-19 preventive

measures.
(Table 2) presents the mean score for participants’ knowledge about COVID-19 preventive
measures. Participants’ scores differed significantly by gender, age, education level,
employment status and their level of commitment to MOH instructions regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic. Females, individuals aged below 39 years, individuals with secondary
school education or higher, university students, individuals who have reported that they are
committed to MOH instructions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and users of herbal

products and food supplements had a higher knowledge score compared to others (p< 0.05).
The Tukey HSD test confirmed that those aged 60 years and above, those with higher
education, employees, and those who reported that they are not committed at all were the
main sources of significant variation between groups.
Multiple linear regression analysis showed that being female, having secondary school
education or lower, or higher education (PhD or a master’s degree) were important predictors
of having a higher knowledge score about COVID-19 preventive measures (p< 0.05). On the
other hand, being unemployed was an important predictor of having a relatively low
knowledge score (p< 0.05), refer to (Table 3).
3.3

Beliefs about the use of herbal products and/or food supplements as a protective

measure
Around 14.9% (n= 783) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or
nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease.
In addition, 7.2% (n= 378) reported that they had used these products for a while and then
stopped.
Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants
to try herbal products, and 37.5% (n= 354) of the participants reported that they obtained the
herbal products from their own home. When they were asked about the types of dietary
supplements that they have used or were currently using, 94.4% (n= 521) reported taking
vitamin C. In terms of participants’ beliefs about the use of herbal products and/or food
supplements as a protective measure, 34.4% of the participants believe that eating garlic
helps to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. This belief in
herbal products was followed by vitamin C, which 29.3% of the participants’ believe has a
role in treating or reducing the chances of contracting COVID-19. For further details about
beliefs regarding the use of herbal products and/or food supplements as a protective measure,
refer to (Table 4).
3. Discussion
This study explored beliefs about and the use of herbal products and food supplements among
the general population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In addition, this study explored the
population’s knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures, specifically handwashing
techniques and social distancing. Besides this, the level of knowledge about COVID-19 was
assessed between users and non-users of herbal products and food supplements.

The findings of our study highlight the importance of educating the general population about
COVID-19 transmission and the preventive measures that play a vital role in their protection
from getting infected with the disease and which dramatically reduce the spread of the
disease.
The explosive spread of COVID-19 has been a matter of international concern, including in
the Middle Eastern countries. The SARS-CoV-2 high infectivity rate has been established
regardless of the appearance of symptoms, which may extend to 14 days (Algaissi et al. 2020;
Singhal 2020). Current evidence indicates that the causative virus for COVID-19 is
transmitted through respiratory droplets or when contaminated hands touch the mucosa of the
mouth, nose, or eyes; the virus can also be transferred from one surface to another by
contaminated hands, which facilitates indirect contact transmission. These facts, together
with the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, have pushed the health authorities to
consider many preventive measures to stem the spread of the pandemic (Nemati, Ebrahimi,
and Nemati 2020; Sen-Crowe, McKenney, and Elkbuli 2020). In the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia, the Ministry of Health, based on its previous experience from the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic in 2012, has immediately established multiple
campaigns, launched mobile health applications and call centres, and provided the public
with information about COVID-19, as well as providing answers to related queries to
enhance public awareness and engage the public in active learning and searching for
information about related precautionary measures (Algaissi et al. 2020). These approaches
have provided residents with information related to washing hands with soap in the correct
way for the required amount of time, the benefits of staying at home, and related
precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus (Aldarhami et al. 2020).
The majority of the participants (75.0%, n= 3,947) reported that they are committed (either
all the time or except in some emergency circumstances) to the recommendations of the
Saudi Ministry of Health regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, which could reflect the
effectiveness of the timely organisation of plans (even before the pandemic reached KSA) by
the Saudi MOH to raise awareness among the population about preventing the spread of
COVID-19. This is probably due to the previous experience of the Saudi people in response
to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic in 2012 (Aldarhami et al. 2020).
Nevertheless, the level of knowledge among the population about COVID-19 preventive
measures was moderate (55.0%; 5.5 out of 10). This confirms the result of a recent study that
was conducted among three Arabic countries (Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait), which
reported that the overall population knowledge about COVID-19 was moderate (66.1%).

Furthermore, and confirming the findings of our study, this study highlighted that the
population knowledge is mainly defective as regards disease transmission routes (Naser et al.
2020). Less than 25.0% of the participants knew the proper procedure of handwashing in
terms of the time needed and the proper procedure itself. In addition, only 40.1% (n= 2,107)
of them were aware of the appropriate physical social distance needed to protect from
COVID-19 transmission. The World Health Organization has emphasised the importance of
taking actions that optimise protection and control of disease transmission among the
community (World Health Organization 2020b). Our study identified that there is a
significant gap in the knowledge among the general population about COVID-19. There is a
need to improve individuals’ knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures through
continuous health education.
In our study, around 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used or are
currently using herbal products or nutritional supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic to
protect themselves from the disease. Herbal products and food supplements are used
worldwide either to enhance health or to help with health-associated problems. The shortage
of new and ecient pharmacological treatments to combat viral and drug-resistant infections
has turned attention to medicinal plants as a potential source of effective treatment for
disease. The rapid spread of the recently emerged COVID-19 pandemic, together with the
absence of an effective vaccination or treatment for COVID-19, has elevated the fear, panic,
and anger among the general public (Liu et al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020a). As
might be expected, individuals exposed to the dangers of such infections look for self-care
measures and turn to unconventional remedies such as herbal products and food supplements
to reduce the risk and make the situation more controllable (Saudi Ministry of Health 2020;
Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control 2020; World Health Organization 2020c).
The shortage of new and ecient conventional drug treatments to combat drug-resistant
infectious diseases (Zahn et al. 2019) and infections has turned attention towards medicinal
plants as a potential source of novel drugs. The use of herbal products among patients has
become popular, and much literature has reported its use in the case of threatening emerging
infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS (Hwang et al. 2020).
Better knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures was associated with being female,
having secondary school education or higher education (PhD or a master’s degree). Unlike
previous studies which showed no significant difference in knowledge about COVID-19
between males and females (Naser et al. 2020), our study found that females have better
knowledge compared to males. This could be due to the difference in the assessment tool

used, and the time of conducting the study as the knowledge level could increase with time
during the pandemic due to continuous educational campaigns carried out by the
governmental authorities. The results of previous studies were in line with ours regarding the
higher level of knowledge among individuals with a higher level of education (Naser et al.
2020; Zhong et al. 2020).
Overall, knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures among our study
population was moderate, which could lead to a higher probability of risky practices during
the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicates that there are gaps in the knowledge of the general
population and that there is a need to improve individuals’ awareness and knowledge via
extensive health education strategies.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the Middle Eastern countries that
investigated knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures (specifically handwashing
techniques and social distancing), and beliefs about and the use of herbal products and food
supplements among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. A strength of
our study is that a large sample of participants was recruited during this critical period.
However, there are some limitations. The study design itself, a cross-sectional survey design,
limited our ability to identify causality between study variables. There are limited studies that
have evaluated individuals’ knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of herbal
products and food supplements worldwide and in the Middle East specifically, which limited
our ability to compare our findings with Arabic-speaking countries of a similar
socioeconomic level and culture. Additionally, the use of an online survey for data collection
might have excluded some vulnerable populations who could not be reached and we may
have missed some of the targeted population. Finally, we were not able to estimate the
response rate for our questionnaire study.
4. Conclusion
The findings of our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a
moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A
considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food
supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. We suggest that policymakers
provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease
transmission routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should
be evidence-based to ensure patient safety.
