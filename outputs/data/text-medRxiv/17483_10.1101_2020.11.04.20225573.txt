Abstract
Background: Knowing the transmissibility of asymptomatic infections and risk of infection from
household- and community-exposures is critical to SARS-CoV-2 control. Limited previous evidence is
based primarily on virologic testing, which disproportionately misses mild and asymptomatic infections.
Serologic measures are more likely to capture all previously infected individuals.
Objective: Estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from household and community exposures, and
identify key risk factors for transmission and infection.
Design: Cross-sectional household serosurvey and transmission model.
Setting: Geneva, Switzerland
Participants: 4,524 household members ≥5 years from 2,267 households enrolled April-June 2020.
Measurements: Past SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed through IgG ELISA. Chain-binomial models
based on the number of infections within households used to estimate the cumulative extra-household
infection risk and infection risk from exposure to an infected household member by demographics and
infector’s symptoms.
Results: The chance of being infected by a SARS-CoV-2 infected household member was 17.3%
(95%CrI,13.7-21.7%) compared to a cumulative extra-household infection risk of 5.1% (95%CrI,4.55.8%). Infection risk from an infected household member increased with age, with 5-9 year olds having
0.4 times (95%CrI, 0.07-1.4) the odds of infection, and ≥65 years olds having 2.7 (95%CrI,0.88-7.4)
times the odds of infection of 20-49 year olds. Working-age adults had the highest extra-household
infection risk. Seropositive asymptomatic household members had 69.6% lower odds (95%CrI,33.788.1%) of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms, accounting for
14.7% (95%CrI,6.3-23.2%) of all household infections.
Limitations: Self-reported symptoms, small number of seropositive kids and imperfect serologic tests.
Conclusion: The risk of infection from exposure to a single infected household member was more than
three-times that of extra-household exposures over the first pandemic wave. Young children had a
lower risk of infection from household members. Asymptomatic infections are far less likely to transmit
than symptomatic ones but do cause infections.

Background
Household-centered studies provide an enumerable set of individuals known to be exposed to an
infectious person, hence, they have played an important role for estimating key transmission properties
of SARS-CoV-2. However, most published studies of SARS-CoV-2 household transmission rely on
clinical disease (COVID-19), and/or PCR-based viral detection to identify infected individuals.1,2 Due to
the narrow time window after exposure in which RT-PCR can be highly sensitive,3 case ascertainment
based on virologic testing may miss infections, especially those that are mild or asymptomatic.4 This
can lead to important biases and limit what can be studied, including underestimates of the importance
of sub-clinical infections and household secondary attack rates.4
Serologic studies provide an alternative tool for understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Serological
tests remain sensitive to detecting past infections well beyond the period when the virus is detectable,5–
7
thereby providing a measure of whether individuals have ever been infected.
Virologic and serologic studies have provided important insights into SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These
include estimates of the household secondary attack rate (e.g., 17% in a recent meta-analysis2) and
evidence of reduced infection rates among young children.2,8,9 However, in general, these estimates do
not distinguish between intra- and extra-household transmission nor do they provide an estimate of
transmission risk from a single infected individual. A notable exception is a household study from
Guangzhou, China10 , but this PCR-based study suffered from the limitations of virologic testing noted
above. Hence, a number of critical gaps in the evidence remain, including the relative role of
transmission between household members, the frequency of viral introductions into households from
the community, the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, and the effect of age on transmission.
To help fill these gaps, we apply household transmission models to data from a cross-sectional,
household-based population serosurvey of 4,534 people from 2,267 households in Geneva,
Switzerland. We provide a serology-based assessment of transmission between intra- and extrahousehold contacts, identify risk factors for infection and transmission and estimate the relative risk of
asymptomatic transmission. By doing so, we provide important evidence for guiding the COVID-19
pandemic response.
Methods
Study design, participants, and procedures
The SEROCoV-POP study is a cross-sectional population-based survey of former participants of an
annual survey of individuals 20-74 years old representative of the population of Geneva (Canton),
Switzerland. The full survey protocol is available online and a detailed description of the design and
seroprevalence results were previously published.11,12
The SEROCoV-POP study invited all 10,587 participants of the previous annual surveys to participate
in the study through email or post. Participants were invited to bring all members of their household
aged 5 years and older to join the study. After providing informed written consent, participants either

filled out a questionnaire online, in the days before their visit, or on site at the time of their visit. The
questionnaire included questions about participants’ demographics, household composition, symptoms
since January 2020, details on the frequency of extra-household contacts and reduction in social
interaction since the start of pandemic. Only participants 14 years and older were asked about their
frequency of extra-household contacts and changes in behavior. Despite this age cut off, we use more
standard age cutoffs (10-19 years) in our analysis for comparability with other studies.12 We defined
symptom presentation a priori as having reported any of: cough, fever, shortness of breath, or loss of
smell or taste since January 2020 (symptoms reported in the 2-weeks prior to testing were excluded in
a sensitivity analysis). We collected peripheral venous blood from each consenting participant.
Households where all members provided blood samples were included in the present analysis (there
was a 100% questionnaire response rate in this group). As blood was not collected from children under
5, all households with children in this age group were excluded. We conducted a sensitivity analysis
with all households, regardless of whether all members provided blood samples, effectively treating
household members outside the study as a community source of infection. The study was approved by
the Cantonal Research Ethics Commission of Geneva, Switzerland (CER16-363).
Laboratory analysis
We assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in each participant using an ELISA (Euroimmun;
Lübeck, Germany #EI 2606-9601 G) targeting the S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2; sera
diluted 1:101 were processed on a EuroLabWorkstation ELISA (Euroimmun). An in-house validation
study found that the manufacturer's recommended cutoff for positivity (൒1.1) had a specificity of 99%
and sensitivity of 93%, based on positive controls tested between 0 and 39 days after symptom onset.
13
In our primary analyses we defined seropositivity based on the cutoff recommended by the
manufacturer and explored a higher cut-off of 1.5 (>1.5) in sensitivity analyses.13 As the presence of
antibodies has been shown to be a reliable marker of past infection, we use the term ‘infected’ to refer
to a seropositive individual.
Statistical analyses
We fit chain binomial transmission models to estimate two primary quantities; the probability of extrahousehold infection from the start of the epidemic through the time of blood draw (referred to also as
‘community infections’ over the first epidemic wave) and the probability of being infected from a single
infected household member over the course of his/her infectious period (referred to as ‘household
exposures’).14 When fitting these models we explicitly consider all possible sequences of viral
introductions to each household and subsequent transmission events within the household. For
example, in a household with 2 seropositive individuals, both could have been infected outside of the
household, or one could have been infected outside and then infected one other person within the
household. We adapted models to estimate the within household and extra-household transmission risk
according to the characteristics of potential infectees (age, sex, self-reported extra-household contact
behavior) and, for within-household risk, those of the potential infectors (symptoms, age). We imputed
missing data related to extra-household contacts based on household averages (see supplement). We
simulate the proportion of infections attributable to extra-household and within household exposures.

We built a series of ten models including different combinations of individual-level characteristics (e.g.,
age, sex, self-reported contacts, symptoms) and compared their fit using the widely applicable
information criterion (WAIC).15 We implemented the models in the Stan probabilistic programming
language and used the rstan package (version 2.21.0) to sample from the posterior distribution and
analyse outputs.16 We used weakly informative priors on all parameters to be normally distributed on
the logit scale with mean of 0 and standard error of 1.5. We ran four chains of 1,000 iterations each
with 250 warm-up iterations and assessed convergence visually and using the Gelman-Rubin
Convergence Statistic (R-hat).17 All estimates are means of the posterior samples with the 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles of this distribution reported as the 95% credible interval. Full model and inference

Results
Between April 3rd and June 30th, 8,344 individuals coming from 4,393 households were successfully
enrolled in the SEROCoV-POP study (Figure 1, Figure S1).12 The median enrollment date was May
22nd, 86 days after the first case was detected in Geneva (February 26, 2020). In 2,267 of these
households, all members of the household were eligible, available, and provided a blood sample (4,354
individuals). The majority of these households were either one (37.9%, n=860) or two (39.2%, n=889)
person households (Figure S2). The median household size in our study (2.0, interquartile range
[IQR]=1,2) was similar to the general population in Geneva canton (median=2.0, IQR=1,3).18
The median age of participants was 53 years (IQR=34,65), and 53.6% were female. Compared with the
general canton population, our study sample included more individuals 50 years and older and fewer
20-49 year olds. Individuals in older age groups were more likely to live in smaller households: 94.6%
(1,100/1,163) of people who were 65 years and older lived alone or in two-person households versus
44.5% (588/1,302) of those 20-49 years old (Table 1).
Overall, 6.6% (298/4,534) of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG antibodies by
ELISA. Of the 2,267 households included in the analyses, 222 (9.8%) had at least one seropositive
household member. The proportion of households with seropositive members increased from 4.8%
(41/860) in households of size one, to 17.0% (39/229) in households of size three, and was relatively
constant in larger households (Figure S2, Table 1, Figure S3). Symptoms consistent with COVID-19
were reported by 69.5% (207/298) of seropositive individuals although this was significantly lower in
young children (37.5%, 3/8), similar to the results of an early modeling study.19
From the start of the epidemic in Geneva through the time of the serosurvey, the cumulative risk of
infection from extra-household exposures was 5.1% (95% Credible Interval [CrI] 4.5-5.8%). The
probability of being infected from a single infected household member was 17.3% (95% CrI 13.721.7%, Figure 2).
The risk of being infected by a household member increased with age (Figures 2,3). Compared to 2049 years olds, 5-9 years olds had less than half the odds of being infected by an infected household
member (OR=0.4, 95%CrI 0.1-1.4), while those 65 years and older had nearly three times the odds

(OR=2.7, 95%CrI 0.9-7.4). Though credible intervals on individual estimates are wide, inclusion of age
substantially improved model fit (ΔWAIC -14.8, Table S2). In contrast, the extra-household infection risk
was the highest among working age adults (20-49 years olds). Compared to this group, 5-9 year olds
(OR=0.3, 95%CrI 0.1-0.8) and those 65 years and older (OR=0.2, 95%CrI 0.1-0.9) had the lowest risk
(Figure 2, Table S4). Models allowing for differential risk of transmission by the age of the infector were
not well supported by the data (ΔWAIC -15.5 to -24.7) and included no significant differences between
ages (Table S2).
Males were more likely to be infected both outside (OR=1.4, 95%CrI 1.0-1.9) and inside (OR=1.4,
95%CrI 0.6-3.2) the household, though the latter estimate is less strongly supported by the data (Figure
3 & Table S2).
Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 0.30 times the odds (95%CrI: 0.12-0.67)
of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms consistent with COVID19 (Figure 3). The difference was larger (OR=0.24, 95%CrI 0.10-0.56) when only considering those
who reported symptoms more than two weeks before blood draw as symptomatic infections (Table S6).
We found some evidence that those aged 20-64 who reported reducing extra-household contacts
during the pandemic had a reduced odds of extra-household infection (OR=0.67, 95%CrI 0.40-1.2).
However, no similar reduction in the odds of infection was seen in those aged 65 or older and data
were not available for younger individuals (Figure 3, Figure S5).
Using posterior distributions of parameters, we simulated the source of infection for all individuals in the
study. We estimate that 22.5% (95%CrI 20.5-24.5) of all infections were caused by another household
member, with the proportion of infections attributable to household transmission increasing with
household size (Figure S8). In households with two individuals, 23.2% (95%CrI 19.6-26.8) of infections
were between household members, increasing to 41.2% (95%CrI 29.4-47.1) in households of five
people (Table S3). Of within-household infections, we estimate 14.7% (95%CrI 6.3-23.2) were due to
individuals not reporting symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
Here we focus on the results of the best fitting models, but across the ten models considered (Table
S2), estimates were qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the primary findings. Similarly, we
explored the sensitivity of our results to the ELISA seropositivity cutoff and found no qualitative
differences in results (Figure S4).
Discussion
The results presented here appropriately place symptomatic household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in
the context of community risk and asymptomatic spread. We show an approximate 1 in 6 risk (17.3%,
95%CrI 13.7-21.7%) of being infected by a single SARS-CoV-2 infected household member (Table S3).
This contrasts with a 1 in 20 chance (5.1%, 95%CrI 4.5-5.8%) of being infected in the community over
most of the first epidemic wave in Geneva, a period of roughly 2 months. Despite the high risk of
transmission from an infected household member, as in many cities in high-income nations, households
are mostly small limiting opportunities for onward transmission. Thus, less than a quarter (22.5%,

95%CrI 20.5-24.5%) of cases could be attributed to transmission between household members. While
asymptomatic individuals appear to be less than a third (0.30, 95%CrI 0.12-0.66) as likely to transmit,
they cannot be dismissed as inconsequential to disease spread, and are responsible for one in six
(14.7%, 95%CrI 6.3-23.2) within-household transmissions in this study. Our results further illustrate the
dual roles of biology and social behavior in shaping age-specific infection patterns, with the age
signature of risk within households indicative of low biological susceptibility in the very young, and
elevated susceptibility in the old; while extra-household risk seems more driven by behavior, with
working age adults being at the highest risk.
It has long been thought that asymptomatic individuals are less likely to transmit than symptomatic
ones, though studies have recovered similar concentrations of viral RNA from naso-pharyngeal
samples from these two groups.20 By using serological data, we were able to show that those not
reporting symptoms have one-third the odds of transmitting within households as symptomatic ones;
and ultimately caused about 10% of household infections. This reduced transmissibility may be due to
reduced duration of viral shedding and reduced ability to mechanically spread virions (e.g., through
coughs). We did not assess the role of asymptomatics in community spread, but it is plausible that they
may play an even larger role there, as symptomatic individuals are more likely to stay home or take
extra precautions to reduce exposures when sick.
As with previous studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household members and other close
contacts2,21, we find evidence supporting a reduced risk of infection from household exposures among
young children, and elevated risk of infection among those 65 or older. However, it is important to note
that we only find this reduced risk among the youngest children in our study (5-9 year olds), while 10-19
year olds have a similar risk profile to working age adults. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
young children may be biologically less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, though heterogeneity in
social contact and other behaviors within households cannot be ruled out.
Patterns of extra-household infection suggest social factors dominate this risk, as both young children
and older adults are at reduced risk of infection compared to working age adults. As children have
returned to schools in Geneva, the social factors driving this pattern have likely changed significantly
and we may see children become a more significant source of extra-household infections 22, despite
their apparently lower susceptibility. The risk that infected young children pose to their household
members is unclear; the sample size was likely too low to detect small to moderate differences in risk.
We did not find any significant relationship between age of infector and probability of transmission (nor
did including these terms improve model fit), but children are less often symptomatic23 and we did find a
strong relationship between symptoms and transmission.

Our study has a number of important limitations. Symptoms were self-reported and, given that the times
of infection are unknown, they may not necessarily have been a result of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We cannot exclude recall bias in symptom reports and other self-reported exposures. Further, we
looked at only a narrow range of symptoms to increase specificity, which left out more general
potentially SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms (e.g., nausea, diarrhea). We detected only eight
seropositive children under the age of 10, leading to large uncertainty in age-specific risk estimates for

this group. While validation data of the Euroimmun ELISA from across the world have confirmed its
high specificity and sensitivity for detecting recent infections,13,24,25 most data are from adults, and it is
possible that performance in young children may be different. Although most of the participants in the
study were recruited after the epidemic peak, it is possible that we did not fully capture all infections in
each household due to insufficient time to mount a detectable response or due to waning of responses.
However, when conducting stratified analyses including households recruited early and late, we found
few qualitative differences in the primary results (Figure S5). While we included only households where
all household members provided blood samples in the main analysis, sensitivity analyses of all enrolled
individuals led to similar primary results (Table S6).
This study captures infections that occurred during the first wave of the pandemic in Geneva, a period
of time when workplaces and schools were largely closed and peoples’ social contacts were greatly
reduced. In future phases of this pandemic, we may expect differences in our estimates of the
proportion of transmission that occurs between household members. While we found no evidence in
previous analyses of these data for differences in seropositivity by neighborhood wealth or education,11
these and other indicators of wealth might be associated with transmission risk within Geneva or in
other populations. Likewise, the general nature of the Geneva population and the control measures in
place may limit the generalizability of our estimates of absolute risk of infection, attributable fraction,
and extra-household risks. For example, the increasing importance of household transmission with
increasing household size (Figure S8), suggests household transmission would be far more important
in settings with larger households. However, we believe our estimates of relative risks by age and
symptom status within households, which are likely more biologically driven, should be generalizable to
most settings; as should our general observations about how social and biological factors influence
different types of transmission.
Our study highlights how biological and social factors combine to shape the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection. While we expect some differences across settings, we believe that the general trend in perexposure infection risk by age and sex and increased infectiousness of symptomatic individuals are
fundamental attributes of this pandemic. These differences have important implications for guiding
patient care and public health policy. For example, increased susceptibility of the oldest individuals
suggests that rapid and aggressive measures are needed to protect them as soon as there is any
possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into their living environment. At the population level,
quantifying the infectiousness of asymptomatics can help us understand the extent the pandemic is
driven by asymptomatic infections. Continued serological and virologic monitoring of diverse
populations with detailed analyses like those presented here are critical to the continued evidencebased response to this pandemic.

Supplemental Table 2. Model performance and estimated parameters of the adapted chain binomial
models that incorporate key individual-level factors (e.g., age, sex, reduced extra-household exposure,
extra-household contact frequency of the exposed individuals and symptom status of the potential
infectors) that may be associated with risk of infection from extra-household sources and by a single
infected houseohld member. Odds ratio over 1 indicates higher risk of infection. CrI stands for credible
interval.

Supplemental Table 6. Sensitivity analyses using expanded population and a different definition of
symptomatic infection. In the first sensitivity analyses (results shown in the 2nd and 3rd columns), in
addition to the 2,267 households included in the main analyses, the study population also included 141
households that are only missing blood samples from household members who are 0-4 years old. In
the second sensitivity analyses (results shown in the 4th and 5th columns), the study population
included all 8,344 enrolled individuals. In the third sensitivity analyses (results shown in the 6th and 7th
columns), we considered seropositive individuals who reported symptom onset within the 2 weeks prior
to testing asymptomatic. We ran the main model (model 5) for all three sensitivity analyses. Results of
the main model presented in supplemental table 2 are also shown here in the 8th and 9th columns for
comparison. The main model incorporates individual-level factors including age, sex, reduced extrahousehold exposure of the exposed individuals and symptom status of the potential infectors.

Supplemental Text: Technical summary
1. Chain binomial model description and main assumptions
es
We built a series of models to estimate two quantities: 1) infection risk from extra-household sources
and 2) infection risk from a single infected household member. These models are based on an adap
apted
version of chain binomial models 14,26 that we fit to the final size of infections within households.
The model assumes that 1) each household member can be infected either from within a household
ld or
from extra-household sources, 2) household members mix at random within a household and can infect
inf
one another, and 3) all household members were initially susceptible to infection to SARS-CoV-2, and
an
that infection to SAR-CoV-2 confers immunity to reinfection for the duration of the study period. The
e
explicit modeling of chains of transmission accounts for competing risks between community and
household infection. In addition, we assume our serological survey fully captures all infections in a
household with no misclassification.
We consider all possible sequences of viral introductions to each household and subsequent
transmission events within the household. For example, in a household with 2 seropositive individua
uals,
both could have been infected outside of the household, or one could have been infected outside and
an
then infected one other person within the household. For each possible sequence of viral introductio
tion
and subsequent transmission events within the household, we assign generation of infections for each
eac
household member (i.e., generation for household member i). So, people infected from outside the
household are assigned to generation 0, those they infect to generation 1, those generation 1 infects
cts to
generation 2, and so on. Uninfected individuals are assigned an implicit generation of infinity. We
augment the data and denote each assignment for all members for household h as
, where k
denotes one possible sequence of viral introduction and subsequent transmission events within the
e
household.
We define the probability of a household member i escaping infection from a single infectious
unity
household member j to be
and the probability of individual i escaping infection from the commun
(i.e., outside household contacts) over the course of epidemic to be . We define the probability of
household member i having an infection generation of as:

(i.e., age and sex) and the

Similarly, we estimate , the probability of household member i escaping infection from extrahousehold sources since the start of the epidemic, as a function of an exposed individual’s
characteristics (age and sex) in addition to two variables capturing self-reported behviours related
ed to
social contacts: the reduction in social interactions since the start of the pandemic, and the frequenc
ncy of
extra-household social contacts during the pandemic.

2. Inference
Posterior distributions of parameters are estimated via MCMC using the rstan package, where the
likelihood of each observed household pattern of infections is calculated as follows.
The likelihood of each generation assignment is:

And the likelihood of observing the final infection state (i.e., household attack rate) of a household h is
then:

We set weakly informative priors on all parameters to be normally distributed on the logit scale with
mean of 0 and standard error of 1.5. We ran four chains of 1,000 iterations each with 250 warm-up
iterations and assessed convergence visually and using the Gelman-Rubin Convergence Statistic (R(R
hat).

iral
We simulate the source of infection for all individuals in the study. We first draw one sequence of vira
introductions and subsequent within-household transmission events(
) from all possible
sequences for each household, h, with at least one seropositive individual. Sequences are drawn for
each household with probability vector

following a categorical distribution,

Next, for each individual, i, infected by a household member, we draw the person’s infector from all
household members infected in the previous generation. Infectors are drawn from categorical
distribution with the probability of each potential infector, j, being
4. Handling of missing variables

.

As the questions related to extra-household exposures were only asked to those 14 and older, we
imputed their responses based on others in their household for analyses that included these variable
bles.
To impute the number of extra-household contacts, we took the midpoint of each category (e.g., 4 if
answering 3 to 5 contacts per week) and calculated the average response of household members of
those missing this variable. We imputed missing behavior pre and post-pandemic with the more
common response of household members of those missing this variable. Imputing missing data with
