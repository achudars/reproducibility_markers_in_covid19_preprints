Abstract
Reports on pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS) temporally related to
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing. African and Afro-Caribbean children
constituted about 37% of the cases in these reports. Although glucose-6-phosphatase
dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common among this population, the G6PD status of
these cases has not been reported. We report the first case of PMIS related to COVID-19
from Saudi Arabia. This case was a Saudi G6PD deficient girl who died with PMIS related to
COVID-19. G6PD deficiency induces redox imbalance and exaggerates the inflammatory
response; thus, it might contribute to the development or the grave outcome of our case. We
urgently need to assess the association between G6PD deficiency and COVID-19 in a large
study as the G6PD deficiency may be a useful predictor for the progression of the COVID19.
Introduction
Reports on pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS), also known as a
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, temporally related to coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) are increasing.1-13 Data on race or ethnicity are available for 392 children
with probable, possible, or confirmed PMIS related to COVID-19 in nine studies form
Europe and USA.1-9 Pooled data show that the African and Afro-Caribbean or black children
constituted 37% (144/392) of these cases. Four out of the five dead children whose race or
ethnicity have been reported were black.1, 2 Although glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency is common among this population,14 the G6PD status of these cases has
not been reported in these reports. We report the first case of PMIS related to COVID-19
from Saudi Arabia. This case was a previously healthy Saudi G6PD deficient girl.
Case Report
This case is a 10–15 years old previously healthy Saudi girl. She underwent a nasopharyngeal
swab for acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during a COVID-19

contact tracing process. Her reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
reported positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was asymptomatic for 22 days, and then she started
to have a fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Two days later, she presented to our
emergency room with a clinical picture similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. She
rapidly developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and succumbed to death despite
aggressive medical support. Figure 1 and Table 1 summarize timeline events, investigations,
and management of the case.
Discussion
We report a previously healthy Saudi G6PD deficient girl who died with PMIS after 23 days
of being diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19.
Our case fulfilled the case definition of PMIS related to COVID-19.15-17 Our case aged 10–15
years old, had persistent temperature > 38 C for ≥ 3 days, acute gastrointestinal problems,
clinical features similar to Kawasaki disease, hypotension, shock, myocardial dysfunction,
elevated markers of inflammation, evidence of COVID-19, and no plausible alternative
diagnoses. The PMIS related to COVID-19 in our case manifested 23 days after confirmed
asymptomatic COVID-19. The nasopharyngeal swab of our case continued to be positive for
at least 25 days. Her tracheal aspirate sample, which its yield is better than other respiratory
swabs,18 was negative for COVID-19 after seven days of the PMIS related to COVID-19. We
are fairly sure that the two nasopharyngeal swabs were true positive as nasopharyngeal swabs
of all her household were positive. These observations confirm that PMIS is delayed
inflammatory response after COVID-19.5, 12
Our case is the first case of PMIS related to COVID-19 reported in Arabs ethnicity. This
syndrome has been reported in Middle Eastern decants living in Europe.1, 3-5 However, the
Middle East has many different ethnicities, which have not been reported by these studies.
The fluorescent spot test (FST) for G6PD screening was positive in our case. This result
suggests that our case had a moderate to severe G6PD deficiency as the upper cut-off of our
FST is 2.1 Units/ gram Hemoglobin.19 This G6PD deficiency makes our case exceptional.
African and Afro-Caribbean children overrepresented in reports that have data on race or
ethnicity.1-9 Although glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common
among this population,14 the G6PD status of these cases has not been reported in these
reports.
G6PD deficiency might contribute to the development of PMIS related to COVID-19 and the
grave outcome of our case. G6PD enzyme is present in all body cells, including breast
milk.20, 21 Redox has a vital part in the modulation of inflammation and immune response.22
The G6PD deficiency induces redox imbalance, which exaggerates the inflammatory
response.22 An ex vivo stud showed that pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-8 is upregulated
by G6PD deficiency.22 The duration of systemic inflammatory response syndrome after major
trauma is significantly longer in G6PD-deficient patients compared to their G6PD normal
counterpart.14 Increased hydrogen peroxide in monocytes of G6PD-deficient major trauma
victims has been documented.14 Hydrogen peroxide activates pro-inflammatory tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).22 A recent study suggests that hydrogen peroxide is the first
pro-inflammatory messenger.23 Monocytes of G6PD deficient major trauma victims have
shown to have increased activity and reduced spontaneous apoptosis.14 Reduced antiinflammatory IL-10 level has been evident in monocytes and plasma of type A– G6PD
deficient major trauma victims and in Mediterranean G6PD deficient individuals.14, 24, 25 It
has been shown that alleles of low-producing IL-10, high-producing pro-inflammatory IL-6,
and low-producing pro-inflammatory interferon-γ are predominant in G6PD-deficient trauma

victims.26 Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that ex vivo production of TNF-α, IL-6, and
IL-10 in G6PD deficient and G6PD normal infants are the same.27 Moreover, the G6PD level
is known to decrease with age.28 These observations may contribute to why PMIS related to
COVID-19 has not been reported in infants yet. G6PD deficiency may be a useful predictor
for the progression of the COVID-19. Thus, we urgently need to assess the association
between G6PD deficiency and COVID-19 in a large study.
In summary, we report a previously healthy Saudi G6PD Deficient Girl who died with PMIS
temporally related to COVID-19. G6PD deficiency may be a useful predictor for the
progression of the COVID-19. We believe the association between G6PD deficiency and
COVID-19 deserves further study.
