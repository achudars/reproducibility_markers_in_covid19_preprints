Abstract

25

Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens.

26

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Many estimates of

27

SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 strongly depend on testing frequency and case definitions. The fatal cases

28

due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. We

29

analysed the dynamics of new infection and death cases to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt)

30

and the effectiveness of control measures in the most affected European Countries and the US. In

31

summary, calculating Rt based on the daily number of deaths as well as of new infections may lead to

32

more reliable estimates than those based on infection cases alone, as death based Rt are expected to be

33

less susceptible to testing bias or limited capacities.

34

Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens.

35

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-

36

19 cases in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The

37

estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing

38

epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more

39

reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management

40

of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise and decline in virus infections should be followed by a proportional

41

rise and decline in death cases. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the

42

epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in

43

Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of new infection and death cases were

44

analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures in

45

the most affected European Countries and the US.

46

The daily number of new infection and death cases from 21.2.2020 to 12.04.2020 were downloaded

47

from ECDC (2). A seven-day sliding period was used to smoothen day to day variations. Based on two

48

independent studies we assumed a serial interval of 4 days for SARS-CoV-2 (3, 4).To estimate the daily

49

reproduction number (Rt) in a simple comprehensible manner, we determined the fold-increase of new

50

infections and death cases during the duration of one serial interval. This way, the fold enhancement

51

during one serial interval can be directly taken as the Rt value. Applying this calculation to the daily

52

infection cases in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK and the US revealed initial daily reproduction

53

numbers (Rt) between 2 and 3.55 (Fig. 1). Spontaneous changes in behaviour, implementation of travel

54

restrictions and contact reduction measures probably all contributed to the reduction in Rt observed.

55

Calculating Rt based on the reported daily death cases also revealed a decline in the Rt in each country

56

with a delay of several days. In France and the UK peaks in death based Rt were not preceded by peaks

57

in Rt based on the number of new infections. This may be due to insufficient diagnostic test capacities,

58

limiting the detection of new infections as the numbers of new infections rise steeply. Rt based on

59

infections or deaths converged to nearly identical values in all countries analysed. This is expected, if

60

transmission rates remain nearly unchanged for a period longer than the average interval between the

61

time of diagnosis and the time of death. The Rt values at the time of convergence are in the range of 1

62

and seem to level off in countries that have implemented strict contact reduction measures for the longest

63

period of time. A factor impeding a further decrease of Rt may be ongoing virus spread in highly

64

susceptible subpopulations such as nursing home residents and highly exposed nursing and medical

65

staff.

66

One interpretation of these data is that voluntary changes in behaviour, travel restrictions, and contact

67

reduction measures clearly reduced the Rt in all countries analysed to values around 1. Undoubtedly,

68

reduced adherence to contact reduction measures, in populations tired of these measures or lowering

69

these measures, will to lead to a resurgence in new infections. Based on the current estimates of the Rt

70

the number of new infections and deaths are expected to decline only slowly, if at all. For countries, in

71

which death based Rt have not yet levelled off (e.g. Germany, US), the effectiveness of the national

72

measures implemented to reduce virus spread can currently not be firmly assessed. Despite uncertainty

73

in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of

74

registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a

75

working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases

76

worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death

77

cases by experts in the field. In summary, calculating Rt based on the daily number of deaths as well as

78

of new infections may lead to more reliable estimates than those based on infection cases alone, as death

79

based Rt are expected to be less susceptible to testing bias or limited capacities.

Figure legend. Course of daily reproduction numbers estimated from the number of newly

97

reported SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths in the indicated countries. To estimate the reproduction

98

numbers, Rt , we first determined the mean of the number of infections or deaths reported on the

99

indicated day, the three proceeding days and the three subsequent days. The fold-enhancement of the

100

mean number of infections or deaths for each day during the next four days (corresponding to one serial

101

interval) represents the Rt estimate shown. Data are presented if the mean number of infections or deaths

102

exceeded 100 and 10 events per day, respectively. Mean number of infections and deaths on the 10th,

103

11th and 12th of April were calculated based on the available 6, 5, and 4 data points, respectively. Virus

104

infection occurs approximately 19 to 29 days before the day of death assuming 4 to 7 days of mean

105

incubation period (5) and 15 to 22 days from onset of symptoms to death (6). Thus, the death based Rt

106

values plotted for each day reflect transmissions occurring approximately 24 days before. Similarly,

107

infection based Rt values for each day also reflect transmissions occurring several days before. Delays

108

in testing and reporting further limit the accuracy for defining the actual period to which the Rt values

109

refer to.
