Abstract
Background:
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how a newly emergent communicable disease can lay considerable burden on public health. To avoid
system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing
measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period
of phased re-opening.
Methods:
A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact
behaviour from mid-April to the beginning of August, during different
stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection
equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also
reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing
the ratio of R0 with respect to pre-pandemic data.
Findings:
During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in
the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent
across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time,
particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower
than pre-pandemic values. From the end of May to the end of July ,

the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one,
although with a wide dispersion. Estimated R0 fell below one again at
the beginning of August.
Conclusions:
We have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to
social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. Monitoring
the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount
importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic due to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has
shown how newly emerging infectious diseases can lay considerable burden on
public health and social economic welfare of the society. Since its emergence,
over 40 million confirmed cases and 1,250,000 deaths have been recorded as
of October 21st 2020 [1]. In the absence of established pharmaceutical interventions, many countries across the globe have resorted to non-pharmaceutical
interventions, advocacy of proper hygienic measures (hand washing, sanitizing),
as well as promotion of wide-spread usage of masks to help combat the spread of
this disease. However, sustainability of some of the imposed measures is infeasible in the long term, due to an urgent need to returning back to normal social
life as well as rekindling the economy. Thus governments have been prompted
to lift some of the measures in a phased manner whilst enforcing new/existing
rules such as wearing masks in designated places such as in public transport,
hospitals, schools, workplaces and other places that attract large crowds and
gatherings.
As COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through close-contact interaction with
infected individuals [2], data on social contacts is indispensable in informing
mathematical modeling studies being employed to explore the evolution of this
disease. The last decade of research in infectious disease modeling has shown
how quantifying contact patterns is crucial to capture disease dynamics [3].
However, social contact data capturing behavioral changes in the population
during and across different stages of an epidemic is mostly lacking and mathematical models need to rely on various assumptions, which might be unverifiable.
This raises validity concerns on their appropriateness in guiding decision making.
Thus, as many governments are carefully monitoring the situation to avoid further waves of COVID-19, continual data collection is vitally important to closely
monitor changes in social mixing. This can provide insights on the impact of
different intervention measures as well as help in real-time management of the
COVID-19 crisis, together with other insights from social and behavioral sciences [4] .
Studies comparing social contact patterns before and during the COVID-19
pandemic have been reported for Wuhan and Shanghai [5], the UK [6], the
Netherlands [7], Luxembourg [8], the US [9] and in multiple countries (Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US) [10]. The

overall reduction in the total number of contacts made by individuals ranged
from 48% to 85%, stressing once again the importance of quantifying the impact
of social distancing separately for each country. Also, although little variations
in the number of contacts over time were measured [10] up to mid-April, this
may change as countries relieve stricter measures and social interactions need
to adjust to the new post-lockdown reality [8].
In this paper, we present results from a longitudinal survey of the adult population in Belgium, representative by age, gender and region of residence. The survey involves multiple waves of data collection, and is part of a wider study to look
at changes in contact patterns across European countries (see e.g. UK [6]). Here,
we present results for eight waves (= 16 weeks). We quantify the changes in
social contact patterns comparing pre-pandemic, lockdown and post-lockdown
periods and its impact on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 based on
the changes in the basic reproduction number relying on the next generation
principle. We use a published survey of the Flemish region (Belgium) conducted
in 2010 [11, 12] as reference for the pre-pandemic social mixing. Also, we assess
the uptake of face mask wearing and adherence to hygienic measures in the
population over time.

data. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Antwerp (reference number EC UZA 20/13/147).

Survey methodology
A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked to participate in a multiwave survey about their contact behavior. The sample was selected from existing
panels of individuals frequently participating in online surveys and selected to be
representative of the Belgian population using quotas on age, gender and region
of residence (see Supporting Information for more details). Here we present results for the first eight waves that were collected during and after the lockdown,
with different intervention strategies taking place (see Figure 1 for details).
Participants’ age, education level and occupation were recorded, together with
information regarding their socio-economic status, health status, whether they
experienced symptoms, attitude towards intervention measures and adherence
to intervention measures. Age, gender, occupation and symptoms experienced
were collected also for household members. Specific questions on whether the
participants or any of their household members tested positive for COVID-19 or
if they knew somebody who did were asked. In addition, self-isolation and quarantine (i.e. isolation after potential exposure to infected individuals) periods in
the last 7 weeks were reported. During the survey day, participants were asked
to report all contacts made between 5 am the day preceding the survey and 5 am
of the day of the survey. A contact was defined as an in-person conversation of
at least a few words, or a skin-to-skin contact. Participants could report individual contacts or (from wave 3 onward) contacts with a group of individuals.
For every individual contact, participants filled in the age and the gender of
the contacted person, whether the contact included skin-to-skin touching, the
duration of the contact and the frequency with which they usually contact this
person. Information on the location was collected using pre-specified locations
(home, work, school, leisure activities, other places) and specifying whether the
contact took place in open air or indoors. Contacts reported in group could be
marked as taking place at work, school or any other location and allowed only

for three age categories (0-18, 19-65 and 65+ years) and were reported in two
categories: one explicitly stating that they involved physical contact and one
without specifying this. We assigned specific age-values to the contacts in these
two categories by sampling from the age-distribution of the reported individual
contacts. Contact duration and frequency were not collected for contacts reported in groups.
Participants could complete the survey using a website or an app on their
phone/tablet.

Data analysis
We computed the average number of contacts per participant, stratified by several participant characteristics, like age, gender, household size and day of the
week. We present results in comparison to a social contact survey conducted in
the Flemish region of Belgium in 2010 [11, 12].
We computed R0 as the leading eigenvalue of the next generation matrix informed by the contact matrix while assuming the transmission rates to be proportional to the social contact rates, i.e. “the social contact hypothesis” [13, 14]
from the 2010 survey and from the eight waves of the CoMix survey separately.
To account for sampling variability, we generated 10,000 contact matrices via
bootstrapping using the SocialMixr package [15]. Then, we computed the R0
ratio with respect to the pre-pandemic period as the ratio between R0 from
CoMix survey and R0 from the 2010 survey for each bootstrap iteration, ending
up with a distribution of R0 ratios [16]. We computed the ratio using different
sets of contacts: the total number of contacts and only contacts involving skinto-skin touching.
As the survey does not include individuals younger than 18 years of age, we also
assessed the impact of imputing social contacts for the 0-4 and 5-17 age classes
on the ratio of R0 . To impute these contacts we followed the approach described

in [17] and applied to another social contact survey collected within the same
initiative [6]. We first computed the R0 ratio comparing the CoMix survey with
the 2010 survey for each contact location, considering only the age classes in
common. Then, we computed the number of contacts made by individuals in
the 0-4 and 5-17 age classes for the CoMix survey as the corresponding number
of contacts in the 2010 survey, multiplied by the eigenvalue ratio in each contact
location. We again used bootstrap (n=10,000) to account for sampling variability. These imputed contact matrices are then used to compute the R0 ratio as
explained before. We compare the results of both approaches. R version 3.6.3
was used for all analyses. The code used in this analysis is based on SocialMixr
package [15] and the Socrates tool [18, 19]. The social contact data is available
on Zenodo [20].

lived with two or more non-family adults and 6.1% (92 participants) reported
living in yet a different type of household.
Overall, 34.4% (530) of the participants reported being fully employed, 9.3%
(143) working part-time, 4.5% (70) being self-employed, 25.7% (396) being retired, 7.6% (117) being students and 5.3% (82) being unemployed. Additionally,
4.9% (75) of participants reported being homemakers and 8.4% (129) being disabled or with long term sickness.
In the following waves the participant sample varied in size, with minimal impact on the composition of the sample. The number of survey participants
declined from of 1277 participants (82.8% of the total) during the second wave
to 833 participants (54%) during the eighth wave.

Participant contacts

The average number of contacts in all the waves of the CoMix survey shows a
marked reduction compared with the 2010 pre-pandemic data and also shows
less disassortative mixing with age (Figure 2 and Table 2). During lockdown
(wave 1), the reduction in the average number of contacts was as high as 80%
with respect to the 2010 data. During wave 2 the number of contacts was in line
with the lockdown results, although wave 2 was collected after the re-opening
of companies and shops offering non-essential goods. From wave 3 to wave 7,
a marked increase in the average number of contacts was observed, especially
for the younger age classes. The average number of contact decreased again
from wave 7 to wave 8. The median number of contacts however remained quite
stable (see Figure SI 1), suggesting that the increase in the average number of
contacts is due to a limited number of individuals that report a large number of

contacts. Participants living in the Flemish region reported a higher number of
contacts with respect to participants in the Brussels and Walloon regions (see
Figure SI 5). Over time, we also observed a reduction in the average number
of contacts made at home, whereas the number of contacts made away from
home increased (Figure 3). This is consistent with contacts being established
for the vast majority at home during lockdown. When lockdown was relieved,
an increase of the percentage of contacts outside home was therefore expected.
Contacts at home were also more likely to involve physical contact and to last
longer (see Figure SI 6 and Figure SI 7) than contacts outside the household.
With respect to the pre-pandemic period, in all CoMix survey waves a smaller
fraction of contacts involving skin-to-skin touching was observed.
Participant gender, household size and day of the week do not show a significant relation with the average number of contacts. Figure 4 shows the contact
matrices for the 2010 survey and the waves of the CoMix survey. The overall
reduction in the number of contacts with respect to pre-pandemic scenario is
marked by the color palette. Contact matrices from the CoMix survey present
a more even structure, as they do not show a relatively higher contact intensity
on the main diagonal of the matrix nor do they reveal work contacts (ranging
from 18 years of age to 60 years of age) as the 2010 contact matrix does. From
wave 3 onward, a larger number of contacts in the working population can be
noticed, though with a weaker magnitude than during the pre-pandemic period.
The high number of contacts established by participants in the youngest age
category (from 18 years of age to 30 years of age) is clearly visible.

3.3

R0 reduction

We estimated R0 ratio between the eight waves of the CoMix survey and the
2010 data. The ratio increases with time up to mid July, ranging from a median
of 0.186 (95% CI [0.171 : 0.203] ) for wave 1 to a median of 0.474 (95% CI
[0.344 : 0.644]) for wave 7 (Figure SI 13). At the end of July (wave 8) the R0 ratio
decreases to 0.280 (95% CI [0.210 : 0.377]). When imputing contacts for children
(i.e. individuals <18y), these numbers change to a median of 0.238 (95% CI
[0.225 : 0.252]) for wave 1, 0.469 (95% CI [0.382 : 0.574]) for wave 7 and 0.308
(95% CI [0.269 : 0.353]) for wave 8 (Figure SI 13). Contact imputation generally
increases the R0 ratio. Therefore, this means that contact imputation leads to a
higher reproduction number during and after the lockdown. Considering the R0
to be normally distributed with mean 3.344 and standard deviation 0.028 [21],
social contact data for wave 3 onward point towards a reproduction number
that is higher than one both with and without contact imputation (Figure 5)
up to mid July (wave 7). Data collected at the end of July (wave 8), instead,
point towards a smaller reproduction number. When considering only physical
contacts this increasing trend in the reproduction number is not present. It
has to be considered, however, that the physical nature of the contact is not
recorded for a large fraction of contacts from wave 3 onward (see Figure SI 3).

Face mask wearing and hand hygiene

The fraction of participants reporting to have used a mask in the previous day in any one or more of the following; everywhere, walking on the
street, cycling, during public transport, on the supermarkets/shops, during cinema/bar/restaurant, while at home, or any other place increased strongly from
the first wave up to wave eight. Whereas during wave one only 18% of all participants reported wearing a mask, more than 75% reported wearing a mask during
wave eight. Small variations are observable among different age classes (Figure
6), however non significant. On the other hand, the number of participants that
reported washing their hands at least once in the last three hours slightly decreased over time, dropping from 92% during wave 1 to 89% during wave eight.
In this case, significant differences are observed among age classes, in particular
with younger individuals being less likely to wash their hands, consistently over
all waves. No significant impact of gender is found on face mask wearing, nor
on hands washing (Figure SI 14 and SI 15).

Discussion

The Belgian government imposed several measures in a sequential manner. On
March 13, a directive to close all schools, restaurants, cafes, gyms, and to forbid
public gatherings was issued. Further measures followed on March 17th, when
more strict limitations on the mobility of people were imposed in addition to

closing companies/premises offering non-essential services. On the 4th of May,
the Belgian government started to relieve the country lockdown, with a plan of
progressive relief for the following weeks. Monitoring how a population complies
with social distancing and how it will adjust to the new governmental directions
is crucial to predict epidemic scenarios for the months to come.
In this work we report results for the first eight waves of the CoMix survey,
aimed at monitoring population compliance and contact patterns in the population. We quantified the impact of social distancing measures on contact

patterns, collecting additional information on the use of face masks and compliance to hygiene recommendations.
Although the average number of contacts increased during the different waves of
the survey, its value is still significantly lower than pre-pandemic values [11, 12].
During the first two waves of the survey, the reduction in the average number of
contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. This
value is in line with what was measured in European countries [6, 10, 7, 8] but
smaller than values reported in Shanghai and Wuhan [5] and higher than preliminary results for the US [9]. This reduction in the number of contacts shows a
strong location-specific structure. In the lockdown scenario (wave 1) , contacts
at home account for ∼ 70% of the total number of contacts, with contacts during leisure activities, transportation, and other places accounting for the rest.
Therefore, a smaller reduction is measured in the number of contacts at home
with respect to all other type of contacts. This is quite reasonable, as social
distancing measures impact mostly contact patterns outside households. In the
following waves of the survey (waves 3 to 7), the number of contacts presented
an increase in the average value. During wave 8, a reduction in the average
number of contacts with respect to wave 7 was observed, in line with additional
social distancing rules imposed by the government at the end of July [22]. Median values were however quite stable, implying that the distribution of the
number of contacts for later waves is more skewed than during lockdown and
the first phase of re-opening. Furthermore, the largest increase in the number
of contacts is measured for the youngest age class (from 18 years of age to 29
years of age) and in participants from the Flemish region.
The reduction in the number of contacts due to social distancing impacts
the reproduction number [13]. With respect to that, we measured the R0 ratio considering only adults or imputing contacts of children (i.e. individuals
<18y). The two approaches lead somehow different results, with higher ratio
obtained when imputing children contacts. These results stress that care should
be taken when imputing contacts in children based on behavioral changes in

adults. However, epidemiological implications in the case of the COVID-19 are
difficult to ascertain, as the role of children in the spread of COVID-19 is quite
debated [23, 24, 25, 26]. While some studies report a smaller number of confirmed cases in children [27], pointing towards either a reduced susceptibility or
a reduced infectivity [5, 27], others report higher infection rates in children with
respect to adults [26] and a relevant role in diffusion of children [28]. Without
the ability to discriminate between the two cases, a scenario analysis is needed.
This would reduce the impact of possible bias induced by contact imputation
for children, especially for primary school children. The data shows a slow but
constant increase in the absolute reproduction number, which from wave 3 has
a median value higher than one. It is worth noting that the largest increase
in the average number of contacts is measured among the youngest age class
surveyed (18-29 years of age). Taken together, these two results could signal
the risk of disease resurgence, especially among the younger individuals. Our
result show that physical contacts have not increased after the relaxation of
distancing measures in individually reported contacts. Computing the R0 ratio
only using physical contacts leads to a reproduction number that sets below
one for all the waves of the survey. We need to stress, however, that physical
contact information is missing for most of the group-reported contacts, that are
a considerable percentage of the total number of contacts from wave 3 onward.
Therefore, this analysis is performed on a small subset of the total number of
contacts.
Participation from wave 1 to wave 2 was quite high (82.8%) and still after 16
weeks of data collection around 50% of the panel participant opted for filling
the questionnaire. Establishing a loyal panel of participants is of course crucial
for monitoring behavioral changes and population compliance to government
directions over time.
We measured an increasing use of face-masks in the participants, starting from
18% during lockdown to more than 75% at the beginning of August. This is
confirmed also from a widely participated, non-representative survey [29] that
was deployed in Belgium following the lockdown. This increase is likely linked
to the increase of contacts outside the households, where wearing a face-mask
could be compulsory or perceived as more important to ensure safety during interactions. We did not measure gender-specific effects, although these have been
reported in other countries, where face mask wearing was not mandatory [30].
Our work is based on several working assumptions, that may result in limitations of our work. To avoid longer ethical scrutiny and deploy the survey as
promptly as possible we decided to exclude children (i.e. individuals <18y) from
our survey. As we have shown, however, contact imputation for children based
on contact reductions of adults leads to inconsistent results, and thus the best
option was to limit our considerations to the adult population. Nonetheless, we
expect the impact of the younger population to be less crucial for COVID-19
spread. In addition to that, parallel solutions to specifically address children
and their contact patterns during school closure terms may be put in place [29].
Our survey asked participants to record contacts retrospectively. Although this
could be associated with recalling bias [3, 31], such an effect is marginal when
12

participants have to remember contacts from recent time [32]. This is even more
so in a lockdown situation, when the total number of contacts is very low. As
a final remark we measured the expected impact of contact patterns on R0 .
It should be stressed, however, that changes in R0 could be due to changes in
infection transmissibility, which could be affected by several factors, like the
use of face mask, increased caution during conversational contacts and possible
direct/indirect effect of climate variables on transmission.
In conclusion, we have shown how a representative survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. As neither
a vaccine nor adequate therapeutic options are available at this time, monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount
importance to properly assess the impact of such interventions and avoid further
waves of COVID-19.
