Abstract
Background
The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December
2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving
epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would
provide timely information to guide intervention policy.
Methods
We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from
official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of
February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic
characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian
approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the
provincial level.
Results
The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger
age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom
onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until
January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean
incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial
interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside
Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations
and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less

than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen
City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the
analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold
since the end of January.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement
restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19
transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here
implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.

Introduction
Since December 2019, an increasing number of atypical pneumonia cases caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been
reported in Wuhan City of Hubei Province, China1. As of February 17, 2020, a
total of 72,436 cases of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) with 1,868
deaths have been reported in mainland China2. The outbreak has now spread to
twenty-five countries beyond China3. The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern on January 30, 20204.

An early report on epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak included analysis of
the first 425 confirmed cases detected in Wuhan by January 22, 20205. Since then,
the temporal epidemic curve and spatial dissemination of COVID-19 changed
quickly, rapidly growing to 72,436 cases by February 17 with 17% of cases
reported outside of Hubei. In these other provinces, the COVID-19 epidemic is
characterized by a mix of local transmission and importation of cases from
Hubei6. A recent report based on the 44,672 confirmed cases detected in
mainland China by February 11 gave a description of the characteristics of
COVID-19 cases for China overall and for Hubei Province6. However, until now,
there has been little information to understand the epidemiological features and
transmission dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei. This information
would be crucial to inform intervention policy in real-time not only for China but

also for other countries that are receiving cases from China.

In the present study, we aim to describe the epidemiological characteristics of
COVID-19 outbreak after 50 days of detection in the provinces outside Hubei. We
also estimate changes in key time-to-event distributions and reproduction
numbers to assess whether the strict control measures have been able to slow
transmission.

Methods
Case definitions and surveillance
Since the outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases was detected in Wuhan at the
end of December 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(China CDC) has launched a new surveillance system, first in Wuhan, then
extended to the entire country, to record information on COVID-19 cases. Case
definitions for suspected cases and laboratory-confirmed cases, and the
description of the surveillance system have been published1 and reported
elsewhere5. Details are summarized in Appendix (page 2).

In the first version of “Guideline on diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus
infected pneumonia (NCIP)” issued by China CDC on January 15, 2020, a
suspected NCIP case was defined as pneumonia that fulfilled clinical criteria
(fever; radiographic findings of pneumonia; or normal or reduced white blood

cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset of symptoms) and had an
epidemiologic link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan or travel
to Wuhan within 14 days before symptom onset. The subsequent two versions of
case definitions issued on January 18 and 22, separately, removed one of the
clinical criteria (i.e. no reduction in symptoms after antimicrobial treatment for 3
days following standard clinical guidelines) to accelerate identification of cases
and revised the epidemiological link (e.g. a travel history to Wuhan or direct
contact with patients from Wuhan who had fever or respiratory symptoms
within 14 days of symptom onset, or to be a potential case in a cluster). In the
fourth version issued on January 27, the clinical criteria was loosened to meet
any two of the three prior clinical criteria (i.e. fever; radiographic findings of
pneumonia; normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte
count at early stage of illness) while the epidemiological link added one more
criteria (e.g. epidemiological link with confirmed COVID-19 case). In the fifth
version issued on February 4, clinically-diagnosed cases were defined as
suspected cases with radiographic findings of pneumonia, to be used exclusively
in Hubei7.

Data collection
Daily aggregated data on the number of cumulative cases in mainland China were
extracted from the official websites of national, provincial, and municipal Health
Commissions (see Tab. S1 in Appendix).

Individual records on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from
two official publicly available sources, including: (i) websites of national,
provincial, and municipal Health Commission; (ii) websites of national and local
government affiliated medias. Individual information was extracted and entered
into a structured database comprising demography, exposure and travel history,
timeline from exposure, symptom onset, hospital admission, and date of official
announcement (reporting date). Each individual record was extracted and
entered by three coauthors and was cross-checked to ensure data accuracy.
Conflicting information was resolved based on the data source (i). In this study,
we used information on age, sex, location of detection, exposure history, dates of
symptom onset, hospital admission, and official announcement. Details on the
collection of individual data and assessment of completeness of variables used in
the study are provided in Tab. S1-S2 in Appendix.

We also validated our individual records against the official line lists obtained
from the websites of Shandong Provincial Health Commission, Shenzhen
Municipal Health Commission, and Hunan Provincial Health Commission for the
key variables used in this study (see Tab. S3 in Appendix).

Statistical analysis
We restricted analyses to the provinces other than Hubei where the majority of

our individual records are available (98%, 8,579/8,738). We used the date of one
key change in case definition to divide the epidemic into two time periods. The
first period runs from the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan through to January
27, when the definition of suspected cases in the fourth version issued by China
CDC was loosened to capture milder cases (radiographic evidence of pneumonia
was no longer necessary, and epidemiological links extended to contact with
confirmed cases). The second period runs from January 28 through to February
17. We performed statistical analyses of demographic and epidemiological
characteristics of confirmed cases stratified by the two epidemic periods.

We estimated key epidemiologic parameters on time-to-event distributions for
COVID-19 cases, including symptom onset to first healthcare consultation,
hospital admission, and official announcement. We estimated the time from
infection to symptom onset (incubation period) by analyzing COVID-19 cases
with asserted epidemiological links (clusters) identified by prospective contact
tracing. The date of presumed infection was estimated from cases’ history of
exposure, excluding cases with exposure to Wuhan. When multiple exposures
were reported, we considered the interval between the first and last recorded
dates of exposure. We fitted three parametric distributions (Weibull, gamma, and
lognormal) to time-to-event data and selected the best fit based on the minimum
Akaike information criterion (AIC).

We analyzed clusters of COVID-19 cases with epidemiological links asserted by
prospective contact tracing to estimate the serial interval, which is defined as the
interval between onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of
symptoms in secondary cases generated by that primary case. The serial interval
is then estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the lag between the dates of
symptom onset of the primary and secondary cases (with no travel history
to/from Wuhan/Hubei) across all clusters.

By leveraging the estimated distribution of the serial interval, we provide
estimates of the net reproduction number (Rt), which is the average number of
secondary cases generated by a typical primary case at time t. Consecutive
generations of cases arise after a period measured by the serial interval or by the
generation time. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate Rt from the time series
of symptom onset dates and the distribution of the serial interval8,9. For this
analysis, the last 9 days of the dataset were not considered to deal with the
possible incompleteness of the dataset due to reporting delays. Details on the
methodology are reported in the Appendix (page 18).

Statistical analyses were performed with R (version 3.6.0). The reproduction
number was estimated from a code in C language written by the authors and
available upon request.

Ethics
The study was approved by the Institutional review board from School of Public
Health, Fudan University (IRB#2020-02-0802). All data were collected from
publicly available sources and did not contain any personal information.

Results
As of February 17, 2020, a total of 72,436 COVID-19 cases were reported in all
provinces (n=31) of mainland China. 59% (42,752/72,436) of cases including
clinically-diagnosed cases (14,953) detected in Wuhan City of Hubei Province, 24%
(17,237/72,436) of cases including clinically-diagnosed cases (1,569) in other
cities of Hubei Province, and 17% (12,447/72,436) of confirmed cases in other
provinces (Fig. 1A). We collected individual information from official publicly
available sources on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outside Hubei by
February 17, accounting for 69% (8,579/12,447) of total cases reported (see
Tab.S3 and Fig. S1 in Appendix for a validation of the database and Tab. S4 for an
analysis of the representativeness of the dataset). Starting at the end December
2019, the COVID-19 epidemic grew rapidly outside Hubei, characterized by a mix
of local transmission and importation of cases from Hubei (Fig. 1B).

The median age of the cases was 44 years (range, 1 month to 97 years), with an
increasing proportion of cases in age groups below 18 years old (p<0.001) and
above 64 years old (p<0.001) observed in the more recent time period. However,

the proportion of cases among individuals aged <18 years remains low (5%), see
Tab. 1. The proportion of male cases decreased between the two epidemic
periods (p<0.001), from 54% to 49%. As of February 17, 51% of cases were male
(see Fig. S2 in Appendix).

The presence of at least one known exposure was reported by 77% of cases. In
the early epidemic period, most cases reported an exposure in Wuhan or Hubei.
Subsequently, an increasing number of cases reported exposure to COVID-19
cases or patients with acute respiratory infections (Tab. 1).

The time interval from symptom onset to hospital admission shortened as the
epidemic progressed, decreasing from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) during the first
period of the epidemic to 2.6 days (95%CI: 0.0-9.0) in the second period (Tab. 2).
A similar decreasing trend over time was observed for the interval from
symptom onset to first healthcare consultation as well (Tab. 2).

We analyzed the time interval from exposure to illness onset for 49 cases (with
no travel history to/from Wuhan/Hubei ) identified by prospective contact
tracing in 37 clusters. We estimated a mean incubation period of 5.2 days (95%CI:
1.8-12.4), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 10.5 days. We find that
the distribution of the incubation period is well approximated by a lognormal
distribution (see Fig. S3 and Tab. S9 in Appendix).

We analyzed the time interval between symptom onset in 35 secondary cases
and symptom onset in 28 corresponding primary cases. These secondary cases
were identified by prospective contact tracing of 28 clusters and had no travel
history to Wuhan/Hubei (see Appendix, Fig. S4). One case who reported the
onset of symptoms on the same day as the index case was dropped from the
analysis (see Appendix, Tab. S10 and Fig. S5 for a sensitivity analysis). Moreover,
as we cannot exclude that a fraction of these secondary cases had a previous
exposure to an unidentified infection source, we performed a sensitivity analysis
by different levels of data censoring (see Appendix, pages 16 and 17). We
estimate the serial interval to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.1
days (95%CI: 1.3-11.6). A comparison between the distribution of the incubation
period and of the serial interval is reported in Fig. 2.

The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 are extremely different among the
provinces outside Hubei. Here we report the results for a city (Shenzhen – a
major city with more than 12 million inhabitants in Guangdong Province) and
two Provinces (Hunan and Shandong) for which we have validated our individual
records against the full official line list compiled by the respective local health
authorities. Results for other seven locations are included in Appendix (Fig. S6
and S7). Despite the selected locations are all among the provinces reporting the
largest number of COVID-19 cases as of February 17, 20203, they show highly

different transmission patterns. Specifically, in Shenzhen City, we estimated Rt
above the epidemic threshold for about a week (approximately from January 16
to January 24) with a maximum value of 1.40 (95%CI: 1.04-1.85) when
considering a serial interval of 5.9 days on average. The outbreak was mostly
sustained by cases with travel history to/from Wuhan/Hubei (Fig. 3A). In Hunan
Province, we estimated Rt to be above the epidemic threshold for about two
weeks with a peak value of 1.58 (95%CI: 1.29-1.92) considering an average serial
interval of 5.9 days (Fig. 3B). Shandong Province showed an longer period (more
than two weeks) characterized by sustained local transmission and a larger peak
value of Rt: 2.17 (95%CI: 1.69-2.76) considering an average serial interval of 5.9
days (Fig. 3C). In these three locations, Rt remained steadily below the epidemic
threshold since the end of January 2020 (Fig. 3A-C). In general, we found that in
all the analyzed areas (8 out of 9 most affected provinces outside Hubei and one
additional location), Rt was below the epidemic threshold as of February 8.

Discussion
We have provided an assessment of the rapidly changing epidemiology and
transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei Province in
mainland China. We found significant differences in the epidemiology of
COVID-19 as the epidemic continues to spread across China. Most importantly, as
of February 8, 2020, we estimate the net reproduction number to be below the
epidemic threshold in the provinces that have reported the largest number of

cases (outside Hubei). This suggests that, thanks to the containment measures
including isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, and strict restrictions on
personal movement in the general community, China have made key steps
towards the interruption of sustained COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei
Province.

At the beginning of the epidemic, COVID-19 cases were mostly observed among
the elderly10. As the epidemic progressed, we observed a shift towards younger
(<18 years) and older (65+ years) cases. Since January 28, 2020, however, the
proportion of confirmed cases aged <18 years is still only about 5%, although
this age group represents approximately 20% of the Chinese population. From
the data available here, it is not possible to distinguish whether younger
individuals have a reduced risk of infection or a propensity for milder clinical
outcome given infection (thus resulting in a lower risk of detection). It should
also be considered that schools in China were closed for most of the epidemic
due to the 2020 Chinese New Year holidays11. It is unclear whether nationwide
school breaks could have contributed to the low proportion of confirmed
COVID-19 cases among school-age individuals, and whether schools reopening
will lead to a change in the transmission patterns of COVID-19.

At the very beginning of the epidemic, a disproportionate faction of COVID-19
cases were male10. As of February 17, 2020, however, we estimate that about the

same number of cases are observed among males and females (51% of cases are
male). This suggests either differential exposure by sex occurring at the
beginning of the epidemic (most of cases reported possible exposure to live
markets12,13) or possible bias in the detection of the first few cases.

In the provinces outside Hubei we estimate the incubation period to be 5.2 days
on average, in agreement with previous studies5,14. The 95th percentile of the
distribution (10.5 days) suggests the importance of contact tracing and medical
observations for those with long incubation period.

In the provinces outside Hubei we estimate the serial interval to be on average
5.1 days (95%CI: 1.3-11.6). This estimation is considerably shorter than the
preliminary estimate derived from the analysis of six serial intervals in Wuhan5.
This may be linked to the short time interval from symptom onset to hospital
admission (about 2.6 days on average since January 28) we have estimated for
mainland China outside Hubei, as compared to what was measured in Wuhan in
the early phase of the outbreak5, which could have prevented longer serial
intervals from being observed. It should however be stressed that, as suggested
by a theoretical study8, the serial interval estimated from the analysis of
household clusters may be up to 20% shorter than the true value.

We estimate the serial interval to have about the same length as the incubation

period, in overall agreement with an independent estimate5. This suggests the
possibility for an early peak of infectiousness with possible transmission before
the onset of symptoms. If confirmed, the presence of relevant pre-symptomatic
transmission may hamper control efforts, including contact tracing and prompt
isolation of index cases, as well as passenger screening at airports. In contrast,
strategies based on social distancing and limiting mass gatherings, or contacts in
the workplaces and schools, may still be effective15-17. Although strong evidence
of pre-symptomatic transmission is still lacking, the possibility of transmission
during the incubation phase appears to be supported by field epidemiological
investigations18-20.

The results presented thus far support a change in epidemiological
characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak as time progresses and the epidemic
expands to multiple locations. Many of the key epidemiologic time-delay
distributions are markedly different from those reported in studies focusing on
the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan5. This is likely the
consequence of the increased awareness of the public and physicians, behavioral
changes of the population with respect to respiratory disease symptoms,
increased health care readiness, and elevated alert and response across mainland
China.

We estimate the net reproduction number to have followed markedly different

patterns in different Chinese provinces. We found that in the analyzed provinces
(selected among those mostly affected by the COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei),
the epidemic was self-sustained only for short periods of time (no more than 3
weeks). Most importantly, we estimated that since the end of January 2020, Rt is
below the epidemic threshold in all the analyzed provinces in mainland China
other than Hubei. This is confirmed by the gradual decrease in the number of
detected COVID-19 cases reported across all China (outside Hubei Province).
This suggests a beneficial effect of the currently implemented public health
intervention policies, in combination with the behavior adopted by the
population as a response to the epidemic spread. Nonetheless, it should be
stressed that the effectiveness of containment measures only apply while those
measures are in place, and a relaxation of public health interventions or a
significant change in human behavior may lead to a resurgence in transmission.
Moreover, it is important to stress that our findings are based on the analysis of 9
of the most affected provinces (n=10 locations) in mainland China outside Hubei.
Therefore, although unlikely, it is possible that in other provinces showing only a
few cases at the time of writing the epidemic is still self-sustained by local
transmission events. Moreover, it is still unclear to what extent asymptomatic
and presymptomatic infections contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 and
the level at which they are detected.

It is important to stress that this study is affected by the usual limitations

pertaining to the data analysis of rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks.
The statistical analysis could therefore include biases due to case ascertainment
and non-homogenous sampling over time and by location. The level of
ascertainment of mild cases remains unclear and could present a different
epidemiological characterization. Although the estimates of the net reproduction
number are not affected by an approximately constant underreporting rate of
cases, they may suffer from time-varying reporting rates. It is also important to
consider that the analyzed individual records were retrieved from different data
sources and thus may be affected by geographical heterogeneities in sampling of
cases with specific exposure (imported or locally acquired infections) and with
available dates of symptom onset. However, we analyzed the completeness of
individual records used in this study and compared them with official line lists
for three locations in mainland China. We found that our data was of similar
quality as the official complete line lists.

Even in the presence of the above limitations, a timely updated patient line list
like ours is critical to assess the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of an
emerging pathogen, inform situational awareness, and optimize the responses to
the outbreak. Since January 20, 2020, the National Health Commission of China
incorporated COVID-19 as a notifiable disease21. The Chinese government
committed to timely disclosure of COVID-19 information which was highly
praised by the WHO22. Accordingly, the local Health Commissions and their

officially affiliated medias, where our individual data originates, were authorized
to release real-time information about epidemiological investigations on
COVID-19 cases. The data collected for this analysis represents a valuable source
of information and highlights the importance of publicly available records.

In conclusion, our study provides a detailed overview of the changing
epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in mainland China outside
Hubei Province. Our findings suggest a slowing down of COVID-19 outbreak in
mainland China (outside Hubei Province), indicating that the initial steps taken
towards interruption of COVID-19 transmission may be effective. However, the
epidemic is not yet under control and a large fraction of the population is still
susceptible. The trajectory of the outbreak in China and beyond will depend on
the effectiveness of control policies and human behavior in the coming weeks
and months.

Figure legend
Figure 1. A Geographical distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases (including clinically-diagnosed
cases for Hubei Province) officially reported as of February 17, 2020 (N=72,436) in each province of
mainland China (left) and in each city of Hubei Province (right). B Time series of COVID-19 cases (date
of symptom onset) for which we have individual records in provinces outside Hubei Province, divided
into cases with travel history to Wuhan/Hubei and local transmission. Note that if no information
about the travel history of a patient is reported in our individual records, we assume that the case
locally acquired the infection. Note also that this figure refers to 5,683 cases with non-missing onset
date (out of 8,579 individual cases available in our individual records). The decline in the number of
cases in the last few days is partially due to the delay between the date of announcement of cases and
the date of symptom onset. RT-PCR: reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction. PHEIC: Public
Health Emergency of International Concern.

Estimated net reproduction number (Rt) over 4-day moving average. We excluded the last 9 days of
data (i.e., data after February 8, 2020) to account for reporting delays. In fact, we estimated the 90th
percentile of the distribution of the time from onset to announcement in mainland China outside
Hubei Province during period 2 of the epidemic to be 9.0 days. B Same as A, but for Hunan Province. C
Same as A, but for Shandong Province.
