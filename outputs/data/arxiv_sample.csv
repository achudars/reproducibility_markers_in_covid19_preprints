  report of Corona Check and Corona Health","Within the healthcare environment, mobile health (mHealth) applications
(apps) are more and more important. The number of new mHealth apps has risen
steadily in the last years. Especially the Covid-19 pandemic has led to an
enormous amount of app releases. Notably, in most countries, mHealth
applications have to be already compliant with several regulatory aspects in
order to be declared to be a 'medical app'. However, the latest applicable
medical device regulation (MDR) does not comment in more detail on the topic of
the requirements for mHealth applications. When developing a medical app, it is
essential that all contributors in an interdisciplinary team - especially the
software engineers - are aware of the specific regulatory requirements
beforehand. The development process, however, should not be stalled too long
due to the integration of the MDR. Therefore, a developing framework, which
includes these aspects, is required, to enable a smooth development process.
The paper at hand introduces the creation of such a framework on the basis of
the Corona Health and Corona Check apps. The relevant regulatory guidelines are
listed and summarized to a guidance for medical app developments. In
particular, the important stages and faced challenges emerged during the entire
development process are highlighted.

  pandemic, March 2020 to May 2020","Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially
including people who did not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I
address that critique by fitting a generalized additive model to weekly counts
of all deaths registered in England and Wales during the 2010s. The model
produces baseline rates of death registrations expected without the COVID-19
pandemic, and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths
exposes the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. By April's end,
England and Wales registered 45,300 $\pm$ 3200 excess deaths of adults aged
45+. Through 22 May, the last day of available all-deaths data, 56,600 $\pm$
4400 were registered (about 53% of which were of men). Both the ONS's
corresponding count of 43,205 death certificates which mention COVID-19, and
the Department of Health and Social Care's count of 33,671 deaths, are
appreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated, not
overestimated, the pandemic's true death toll. If underreporting rates have
held steady during May, about 59,000 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might
have been registered through the end of May but not yet publicly reported in
full.

  diagnosis in chest CT images","The outbreak of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has changed
the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been
more than 100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than 2.4
million deaths. It is extremely important the early detection of the disease,
and the use of medical imaging such as chest X-ray (CXR) and chest Computed
Tomography (CCT) have proved to be an excellent solution. However, this process
requires clinicians to do it within a manual and time-consuming task, which is
not ideal when trying to speed up the diagnosis. In this work, we propose an
ensemble classifier based on probabilistic Support Vector Machine (SVM) in
order to identify pneumonia patterns while providing information about the
reliability of the classification. Specifically, each CCT scan is divided into
cubic patches and features contained in each one of them are extracted by
applying kernel PCA. The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our
system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location.
Decisions of each individual patch are then combined into a global one
according to the reliability of each individual classification: the lower the
uncertainty, the higher the contribution. Performance is evaluated in a real
scenario, yielding an accuracy of 97.86%. The large performance obtained and
the simplicity of the system (use of deep learning in CCT images would result
in a huge computational cost) evidence the applicability of our proposal in a
real-world environment.

  era","In October of 2020, China announced that it aims to start reducing its carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 20601.
The surprise announcement came in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which
caused a transient drop in China's emissions in the first half of 2020. Here,
we show an unprecedented de-carbonization of China's power system in late 2020:
although China's power related carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than
2019, the majority (92.9%) of the increased power demand was met by increases
in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear) generation (increased by 9.3%), as
compared to only 0.4% increase for fossil fuels. China's low-carbon generation
in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of
36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when
the fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the
carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of
519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power
demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of
China's power demand could be provided by low carbon sources. Our results thus
reveal that China made progress towards its carbon neutrality target during the
pandemic, and suggest the potential for substantial further decarbonization in
the next few years if the latest trends persist.

  a Case Study of Viral Pathogenesis","Counterfactual inference is a useful tool for comparing outcomes of
interventions on complex systems. It requires us to represent the system in
form of a structural causal model, complete with a causal diagram,
probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments.
Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process
requires substantial domain expertise, and does not scale easily to large
systems, multiple systems, or novel system modifications. At the same time,
many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured
causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a
general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and
converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model
that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the
feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies
in systems biology. The first demonstrates the appropriateness of the
underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the results. The second demonstrates
the versatility of the approach by querying a knowledge base for the molecular
determinants of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

the fact of belonging or not to a particular class of individuals (`infected or
not infected'), after being tagged as `positive' or `negative' by a test, have
never been so popular. Similarly, there has been strong interest in estimating
the proportion of a population expected to hold a given characteristics
(`having or having had the virus'). Taking the cue from the many related
discussions on the media, in addition to those to which we took part, we
analyze these questions from a probabilistic perspective (`Bayesian'),
considering several effects that play a role in evaluating the probabilities of
interest. The resulting paper, written with didactic intent, is rather general
and not strictly related to pandemics: the basic ideas of Bayesian inference
are introduced and the uncertainties on the performances of the tests are
treated using the metrological concepts of `systematics', and are propagated
into the quantities of interest following the rules of probability theory; the
separation of `statistical' and `systematic' contributions to the uncertainty
on the inferred proportion of infectees allows to optimize the sample size; the
role of `priors', often overlooked, is stressed, however recommending the use
of `flat priors', since the resulting posterior distribution can be `reshaped'
by an `informative prior' in a later step; details on the calculations are
given, also deriving useful approximated formulae, the tough work being however
done with the help of direct Monte Carlo simulations and Markov Chain Monte
Carlo, implemented in R and JAGS (relevant code provided in appendix).

  Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation","The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has
spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.
Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an
important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major
challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,
there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing
the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19
segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven
collaborative learning model for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung
infection segmentation. The network consists of encoders with the same
architecture and a shared decoder. The general encoder is adopted to capture
general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, while the
target encoder is adopted to focus on task-specific features of COVID-19
infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated
for the subsequent decoder part. To thoroughly exploit shared knowledge between
COVID and non-COVID lesions, we develop a collaborative learning scheme to
regularize the relation consistency between extracted features of given input.
Other than existing consistency-based methods that simply enforce the
consistency of individual predictions, our method enforces the consistency of
feature relation among samples, encouraging the model to explore semantic
information from both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases. Extensive experiments on
one public COVID-19 dataset and two public non-COVID datasets show that our
method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with existing

  Samples via an App","Background: The inability to test at scale has become humanity's Achille's
heel in the ongoing war against the COVID-19 pandemic. A scalable screening
tool would be a game changer. Building on the prior work on cough-based
diagnosis of respiratory diseases, we propose, develop and test an Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered screening solution for COVID-19 infection that is
deployable via a smartphone app. The app, named AI4COVID-19 records and sends
three 3-second cough sounds to an AI engine running in the cloud, and returns a
result within two minutes. Methods: Cough is a symptom of over thirty
non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19
infection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We
address this problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological
alterations in the respiratory system induced by COVID-19 infection when
compared to other respiratory infections. To overcome the COVID-19 cough
training data shortage we exploit transfer learning. To reduce the misdiagnosis
risk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a
multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture. Results: Results
show AI4COVID-19 can distinguish among COVID-19 coughs and several types of
non-COVID-19 coughs. The accuracy is promising enough to encourage a
large-scale collection of labeled cough data to gauge the generalization
capability of AI4COVID-19. AI4COVID-19 is not a clinical grade testing tool.
Instead, it offers a screening tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone. It
can also be a clinical decision assistance tool used to channel
clinical-testing and treatment to those who need it the most, thereby saving
more lives.

  among Disabled People and Their Caregivers","A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is through the limiting of
in-person contacts. However, for the many disabled people who live in the
community and require caregivers to assist them with activities of daily
living, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible. We seek to determine
which interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and their
caregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with a
compartmental model on a network. The networks incorporate heterogeneity in the
risks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening
measures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers,
disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Among these
groups, we find the probability of becoming infected is highest for caregivers
and second highest for disabled people. Our analysis of the network structure
illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality among
the four groups. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all
groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- particularly
reduce cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which group
most effectively spreads COVID-19 by seeding infections in a subset of each
group and then comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads.
We find that caregivers are the most effective spreaders of COVID-19. We then
test where limited vaccine doses could be used most effectively and we find
that vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating
the general population, essential workers, or the disabled population itself.
Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing,
contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the
exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.

2020. Even though many researches have studied the travel restriction between
cities and provinces, few studies focus on the transportation control inside

inside the city by extracting motor vehicles on the road from two
high-resolution remote sensing image sets before and after Wuhan lockdown. In
order to detect vehicles from the remote sensing image datasets with the
resolution of 0.8m accurately, we proposed a novel method combining anomaly
detection, region grow and deep learning. The vehicle numbers in Wuhan dropped
with a percentage of at least 63.31% caused by COVID-19. Considering fewer
interferences, the dropping percentages of ring road and high-level road should
be more representative with the value of 84.81% and 80.22%. The districts
located in city center were more intensively affected by the transportation
ban. Since the public transportations have been shut down, the significant
reduction of motor vehicles indicates that the lockdown policy in Wuhan show
effectiveness in controlling human transmission inside the city.

unprecedented decreases in both global energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet a
little known that there is also a low carbon shift of the global energy system
in 2020. Here, using the near-real-time data on energy-related GHG emissions
from 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the
pandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system,
representing by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector
that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share
of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy,
wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the
first time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand
(-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in
2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants
supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%).
Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored
low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower
midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most
countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since
rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus
to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon
intensities of electricity as part of a green recovery.

restrictions. Therefore, we employed copula models to examine the impact of
high temperatures on virus transmission. The findings from the copula models

infections and the effect almost vanished under a lockdown policy. Therefore,
this study provides new insight into the relationship between COVID-19 and
temperature, both with and without social isolation practices. Such results can
lead to improvements in our understanding of this new virus. In particular, the
results derived from the copula models examined here, unlike existing
traditional models, provide evidence that there is no substantial influence of
high temperatures on the active COVID-19 outbreak situation. In addition, the
results indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 is strongly influenced by

recent years, publicly available medical data sets became a key factor to
enable reproducible development of diagnostic algorithms in the medical domain.
Medical data contains sensitive patient-related information and is therefore
usually anonymized by removing patient identifiers, e.g., patient names before
publication. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that a
well-trained deep learning system is able to recover the patient identity from
chest X-ray data. We demonstrate this using the publicly available large-scale
ChestX-ray14 dataset, a collection of 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images
from 30,805 unique patients. Our verification system is able to identify
whether two frontal chest X-ray images are from the same person with an AUC of
0.9940 and a classification accuracy of 95.55%. We further highlight that the
proposed system is able to reveal the same person even ten and more years after
the initial scan. When pursuing a retrieval approach, we observe an mAP@R of
0.9748 and a precision@1 of 0.9963. Based on this high identification rate, a
potential attacker may leak patient-related information and additionally
cross-reference images to obtain more information. Thus, there is a great risk
of sensitive content falling into unauthorized hands or being disseminated

limited number of people are being allowed on-site as long as social distancing

Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and arrangement of

arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular

optimal numbers and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family
groups and individual passengers for the social distancing measure. The
obtained optimal arrangements of passengers show complex patterns with groups
and individual passengers mixed in complex and non-trivial ways. This
demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its variants to find these
optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other arrangements of
passengers with the same number of passengers is a suboptimal arrangement with
higher health risks as a result of less distance between passengers. Our model
could be implemented for other social situations such as sports events,

those who had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured by any medical
system at all. We use post-report data for the estimation of the former and
population matching to the latter. We estimate that the reported number of

estimated to be 0.53%, implying a case mortality rate at 2.85% which is close

dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social

what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages
state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison
procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal
ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological
populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the

interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear
effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.

  hospitalisations in England over the pre-vaccination era: results from the
  Public Health England SARI-Watch surveillance scheme","Background: Trends in hospitalised case-fatality risk (HFR), risk of
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and lengths of stay for patients
hospitalised for COVID-19 in England over the pre-vaccination era are unknown.
  Methods: Data on hospital and ICU admissions with COVID-19 at 31 NHS trusts
in England were collected by Public Health England's Severe Acute Respiratory
Infections surveillance system and linked to death information. We applied
parametric multi-state mixture models, accounting for censored outcomes and
regressing risks and times between events on month of admission, geography, and
baseline characteristics.
  Findings: 20,785 adults were admitted with COVID-19 in 2020. Between March
and June/July/August estimated HFR reduced from 31.9% (95% confidence interval
30.3-33.5%) to 10.9% (9.4-12.7%), then rose steadily from 21.6% (18.4-25.5%) in
September to 25.7% (23.0-29.2%) in December, with steeper increases among older
patients, those with multi-morbidity and outside London/South of England. ICU
admission risk reduced from 13.9% (12.8-15.2%) in March to 6.2% (5.3-7.1%) in
May, rising to a high of 14.2% (11.1-17.2%) in September. Median length of stay
in non-critical care increased during 2020, from 6.6 to 12.3 days for those
dying, and from 6.1 to 9.3 days for those discharged.
  Interpretation: Initial improvements in patient outcomes, corresponding to
developments in clinical practice, were not sustained throughout 2020, with HFR
in December approaching the levels seen at the start of the pandemic, whilst
median hospital stays have lengthened. The role of increased transmission, new
variants, case-mix and hospital pressures in increasing COVID-19 severity
requires urgent further investigation.

impact on their communities. The first emergency phases involved a wide closure
of such areas to support ""social distancing"" measures (i.e. travels limitation;
lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the second phase, individual's
risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to ""social
distancing"" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools
could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look
for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work
modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in
touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and
virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated
proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included
according to international health organizations and previous calibration

implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e.
initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant
case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare
the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that ""social distancing""
seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents
an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full
effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and
individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model

both the society and economy. A key factor contributing to the sustained
spreading is the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or hidden
spreaders, who mix among the susceptible population without being detected or
quarantined. Here we propose an effective non-pharmacological intervention
method of detecting the asymptomatic spreaders in contact-tracing networks, and
validated it on the empirical COVID-19 spreading network in Singapore. We find
that using pure physical spreading equations, the hidden spreaders of COVID-19

characteristics of COVID-19 spreading dynamics, we propose a computational
framework capturing the transition probabilities among different infectious
states in a network, and extend it to an efficient algorithm to identify

using our prediction outperforms machine learning algorithms, e.g. graph neural
networks, that are designed as baselines in this work, as well as random
screening of infection's closest contacts widely used by China in its early
outbreak. Furthermore, our method provides high precision even with incomplete
information of the contract-tracing networks. Our work can be of critical
importance to the non-pharmacological interventions of COVID-19, especially
with increasing adoptions of contact tracing measures using various new
technologies. Beyond COVID-19, our framework can be useful for other epidemic

a key pandemic prevention method for public indoor spaces because they are

combining the mobility of a robot with air filtration, the efficacy of cleaning
up the air around multiple people is largely increased. A disinfection co-robot
prototype is thus developed to provide continuous and occupant-friendly
protection to people gathering indoors, specifically for students in a

pattern, the mobile robot is able to serve up to 14 students per cycle while
reducing the worst-case pathogen dosage by 20%, and with higher robustness
compared to a static filter. The extent of robot protection is optimized by
tuning the passing distance and speed, such that a robot is able to serve more
people given a threshold of worst-case dosage a person can receive.

  Understanding Different Temporal Patterns of Infections","Here we propose and implement a generalized mathematical model to find the
time evolution of population in infectious diseases and apply the model to
study the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our model at the core is a non-local
generalization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick(KM) model where the
susceptible(S) population evolves into two other categories, namely
infectives(I) and removed(R). This is the well-known SIR model in which we
further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first
formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of
distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to
describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve
the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of
propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA)
simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized
non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of
spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears
to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in
many cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized
approach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the
rate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age
ratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study
allows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with
respect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. Analysis
of the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic
process originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory
must be local in character but at the same time connect to a global
perspective.

start with a 0D compartmental epidemiological model consisting of Susceptible,
Exposed, Asymptomatic, (symptomatically) Infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, and
deceased populations. We emphasize the importance of the viral latent period
and the key role of an asymptomatic population. We optimize model parameters
for both regions by comparing predictions to the cumulative number of infected
and total number of deaths via minimizing the $\ell^2$ norm of the difference
between predictions and observed data. We consider the sensitivity of model
predictions on reasonable variations of model parameters and initial
conditions, addressing issues of parameter identifiability. We model both
pre-quarantine and post-quarantine evolution of the epidemic by a
time-dependent change of the viral transmission rates that arises in response
to containment measures. Subsequently, a spatially distributed version of the
0D model in the form of reaction-diffusion equations is developed. We consider
that, after an initial localized seeding of the infection, its spread is
governed by the diffusion (and 0D model ""reactions"") of the asymptomatic and
symptomatically infected populations, which decrease with the imposed
restrictive measures. We inserted the maps of the two regions, and we imported
population-density data into COMSOL, which was subsequently used to solve
numerically the model PDEs. Upon discussing how to adapt the 0D model to this

  Models for the COVID-19 Epidemic","This paper deals with the problem of estimating variables in nonlinear models
for the spread of disease and its application to the COVID-19 epidemic. First
unconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the
application of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the
effective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained
methods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range
and can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the
raw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation
method is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified
boundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained
estimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of
pre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can
also be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of
infected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic
optimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints. It is also
shown that both unconstrained and constrained methods when applied to death
data are independent of the fatality rate. The methods are applied to public
death data from the COVID-19 epidemic.

paper investigates contingency planning and resources allocation from a risk
management perspective, as opposed to the prevailing supply chain perspective.
The key idea is that the competition of limited critical resources is not only
present in different geographical locations but also at different stages of a
pandemic. This paper draws on an analogy between risk aggregation and capital
allocation in finance and pandemic resources planning and allocation for
healthcare systems. The main contribution is to introduce new strategies for
optimal stockpiling and allocation balancing spatio-temporal competitions of

studies seeking the cause due to differences in the social distance (population
density), there is an increasing trend toward studies seeking the cause due to
differences in social capital. However, studies have not yet been conducted on
whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it controls
the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the
relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital
using statistical data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that
social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population
densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling
for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship
between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social
capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection
rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus
infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.

$10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ depending on the severity of the outbreak which is
lower than previous estimates obtained from laboratory confirmed patients. We
also estimate quantities of practical interest such as the basic reproduction

European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical

universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most
recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns.
  In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of
infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive
number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these
interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in
behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from
temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of
transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic
time lag between infection and death.
  In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al

effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more

significantly affected the healthcare sector and global economies, which made
it the main subject of various fields in scientific and technical research. To
properly understand and control this new epidemic, mathematical modelling is
presented as a very effective tool that can illustrate the mechanisms of its
propagation. In this regard, the use of compartmental models is the most
prominent approach adopted in the literature to describe the dynamics of
COVID-19. Along the same line, we aim during this study to generalize and
ameliorate many existing works that consecrated to analyse the behaviour of
this epidemic. Precisely, we propose an SQEAIHR epidemic system for
Coronavirus. Our constructed model is enriched by taking into account the media
intervention and vital dynamics. By the use of the next-generation matrix
method, the theoretical basic reproductive number $R_0$ is obtained for
COVID-19. Based on some nonstandard and generalized analytical techniques, the
local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium are proven when $R_0
< 1$. Moreover, in the case of $R_0 > 1$, the uniform persistence of COVID-19
model is also shown. In order to better adapt our epidemic model to reality,
the randomness factor is taken into account by considering a proportional white
noises, which leads to a well-posed stochastic model. Under appropriate
conditions, interesting asymptotic properties are proved, namely: extinction
and persistence in the mean. The theoretical results show that the dynamics of
the perturbed COVID-19 model are determined by parameters that are closely
related to the magnitude of the stochastic noise. Finally, we present some
numerical illustrations to confirm our theoretical results and to show the
impact of media intervention and quarantine strategies.

  infections","Understanding how widely COVID-19 has spread is critical for examining the
pandemic's progression. Despite efforts to carefully monitor the pandemic, the
number of confirmed cases may underestimate the total number of infections. We
introduce a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections using an
broadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data requirements:
COVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As
many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs
between countries using remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for
differences in age structures, health conditions, and medical services. Across
10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the number of
infections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher
than the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The
estimated number of infections is 1.4 million (six times the number of
confirmed cases) for Italy; 3.1 million (2.2 times the number of confirmed
cases) for the U.S.; and 1.8 times the number of confirmed cases for Germany,
where testing has been comparatively extensive. Our prevalence estimates,
however, are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence
studies. We introduce formulas for quantifying the bias that is required in our
data on deaths in order to reproduce estimates published elsewhere. This bias
analysis shows that either COVID-19 deaths are severely underestimated, by a
factor of two or more; or alternatively, the seroprevalence based results are
overestimates and not representative for the total population.

systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every
patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques

Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high
risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already
available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems
already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples
either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the
selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an
inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to
keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in

spreading of infectious diseases. Contact tracing is usually performed manually
by authorized personnel. Manual contact tracing is an inefficient, error-prone,
time-consuming process of limited utility to the population at large as those
in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days,
later. This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The
proposed Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine learning classifier to accurately and
quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a)
classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity
sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications
protocol. SCT leverages BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast
a signature packet when the user is in the public space. Both broadcasted and
observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and they are only
uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public
health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each
smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time
alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The paper includes extensive
experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative
evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that
a decision tree classifier outperforms other states of the art classification
methods in terms of accuracy. Lastly, to facilitate research in this area, and
to contribute to the timely development of advanced solutions the entire data

such as roads. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that
major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple
model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a
quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with
diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected
individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between
individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A
classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system
analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement
of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence
of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when
the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to $1$. More subtle qualitative
features of the final state, showing the important influence of the line, are
also proved here.

Concerns surrounding LUS include the disparity of infected patients and
healthcare providers, relatively small number of physicians and sonographers
capable of performing LUS, and most importantly, the requirement for
substantial physical contact between the patient and operator, increasing the
risk of transmission. Mitigation of the spread of the virus is of paramount

explanatory variables could be a mixture of functional/longitudinal and scalar
variables. Notably some of the scalar variables could be categorical variables

to estimate the unknown functional effects in the model. To avoid the

the asymptotic theories of the resultant Pilot Estimation Based Local Linear

This study aimed to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to
prospectively predict the expected number of cases without any intervention.
The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was
analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic,
Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The
resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent
data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the
current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions
with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate
model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as
determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately
predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance
respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The
simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future
cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results
demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given
country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated
models of population behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the
efficacy of current prescriptive measures against disease spread.

  and Speaker Satisfaction","The (COVID-19) pandemic-induced restrictions on travel and social gatherings
have prompted most conference organizers to move their events online. However,
in contrast to physical conferences, virtual conferences face a challenge in
efficiently scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants
from different time-zones as well as their interests in attending different
talks. In such settings, a natural objective for the conference organizers
would be to maximize some global welfare measure, such as the total expected
audience participation across all talks. However, we show that optimizing for
global welfare could result in a schedule that is unfair to the stakeholders,
i.e., the individual utilities for participants and speakers can be highly
unequal. To address the fairness concerns, we formally define fairness notions
for participants and speakers, and subsequently derive suitable fairness
objectives for them. We show that the welfare and fairness objectives can be in
conflict with each other, and there is a need to maintain a balance between
these objective while caring for them simultaneously. Thus, we propose a joint
optimization framework that allows conference organizers to design talk
schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) between global welfare,
participant fairness and the speaker fairness objectives. We show that the
optimization problem can be solved using integer linear programming, and
empirically evaluate the necessity and benefits of such joint optimization
approach in virtual conference scheduling.

This habit, however, often comes along with certain restrictions. For instance,
most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate

mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions
by exploiting these data structures, yet lack intuitive interpretability as
they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a trade-off between

have applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate fluid flow through the

different delivery methods. The nasal geometry models were derived using
digitized and meshed computed tomography (CT) scans of human patients. Using
the nasal geometries, we simulated two different airflows: a laminar model at
15 LPM (Liters/min) that simulated resting breathing rate and a Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) model used to achieve a higher flow rate of 30 LPM. We were
able to run particle tracking simulations for these two airflow schemes to test
different drug properties such as particle size. The different injection
methods used include surface injection which best replicates an inhaler-based
release of particle droplets into the nostril and the cone injection method

several countries. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of the mitigation
implemented to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mexican territory

vaccine will help to mitigate the pandemic and reduce the need for social
distancing and other mobility restrictions. Our modeling approach is based on a
simple mechanistic Kermack-McKendrick-type model. To quantify the effect of
NPIs, we perform a monthly Bayesian inference using officially published data.
The results suggest that in the absence of the sanitary measures, the
cumulative number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths would have been
at least twice the official number. Moreover, for low vaccine coverage levels,
relaxing NPIs may dramatically increase the disease burden; therefore, safety
measures are of critical importance at the early stages of vaccination. The
simulations also suggest that it may be more desirable to employ a vaccine with
low efficacy but reach a high coverage than a vaccine with high effectiveness
but low coverage levels. This supports the hypothesis that single doses to more
individuals will be more effective than two doses for every person.

on surfaces with lifespan of more than hours. To curb its spread, it is hence
of vital importance to detect and quarantine those who have been in contact
with the virus for sustained period of time, the so-called close contacts. In
this work, we study, for the first time, automatic contact detection when the
virus has a lifespan. Leveraging upon the ubiquity of WiFi signals, we propose
a novel, private, and fully distributed WiFi-based approach called vContact.
Users installing an app continuously scan WiFi and store its hashed IDs. Given
a confirmed case, the signals of the major places he/she visited are then
uploaded to a server and matched with the stored signals of users to detect
contact. vContact is not based on phone pairing, and no information of any
other users is stored locally. The confirmed case does not need to have
installed the app for it to work properly. As WiFi data are sampled
sporadically, we propose efficient signal processing approaches and similarity
metric to align and match signals of any time. We conduct extensive indoor and
outdoor experiments to evaluate the performance of vContact. Our results
demonstrate that vContact is efficient and robust for contact detection. The
precision and recall of contact detection are high (in the range of 50-90%) for
close contact proximity (2m). Its performance is robust with respect to signal
lengths (AP numbers) and phone heterogeneity. By implementing vContact as an
app, we present a case study to demonstrate the validity of our design in

settings to evaluate the risk of inhaling potentially virus-containing
particles. Our results show that the design of ventilation is critical for
reducing the risk of particle encounters. Inappropriate design can
significantly limit the efficiency of particle removal, create local hot spots
with orders of magnitude higher risks, and enhance particle deposition causing
surface contamination. Additionally, our measurements reveal the presence of
substantial fraction of crystalline particles from normal breathing and its
strong correlation with breathing depth.

behavioral adjustments have been unavoidable to stay viable. In this paper, we
employ a data-centric approach to investigate individual mobility adaptations
and mask-wearing in Seoul, South Korea. We first identify six epidemic phases
and two waves based on COVID-19 case count and its geospatial dispersion. The
phase-specific linear models reveal the strong, self-driven mobility reductions
in the first escalation and peak with a common focus on public transit use and
less-essential weekend/afternoon trips. However, comparable reduction was not
present in the second wave, as the shifted focus from mobility to mask-wearing
was evident. Although no lockdowns and gentle nudge to wear mask seemed
counter-intuitive, simple and persistent communication on personal safety has
been effective and sustainable to induce cooperative behavioral adaptations.
Our phase-specific analyses and interpretation highlight the importance of
targeted response consistent with the fluctuating epidemic risk.

restrictive measures the spread of COVID-19 fit on a single wave with small
capacity as for a number of countries with violation of restrictive measures
the spread of the epidemic fit on a waves superposition. For countries with
large population mixing, the spread of the epidemic today also fits into a
single wave, but with a huge capacity value (for Brazil - 80 million people,
for India - 40 million people). We estimated that the epidemic spread in the

spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the epidemic spread in
European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the
USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America

  validation of deep neural networks for geographic extent and opacity extent
  scoring of chest X-rays for SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity","Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the
COVID-19 pandemic, is the assessment of the severity of disease progression.
Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two
important assessment metrics being extent of lung involvement and degree of
opacity. In this proof-of-concept study, we assess the feasibility of
computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity using a deep
learning system.
  Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 396 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2 positive
patient cases. Geographic extent and opacity extent were scored by two
board-certified expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of experience) and a
2nd-year radiology resident. The deep neural networks used in this study, which
we name COVID-Net S, are based on a COVID-Net network architecture. 100
versions of the network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic
extent scoring and 50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets
of CXRs from the study, and we evaluated the networks using stratified Monte
Carlo cross-validation experiments.
  Findings: The COVID-Net S deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.664 $\pm$
0.032 and 0.635 $\pm$ 0.044 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for
geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively, in stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved R$^2$ of
0.739 and 0.741 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic
extent and opacity extent, respectively.
  Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that the use of deep
neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are
needed before adoption for routine clinical use.

more pressing than ever. Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive (potentially
bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we
present a severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal
chest X-ray images. Such a tool can gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections
(and pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of
care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU.
  Methods: Images from a public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively
by three blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as
the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large
(non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19
images which are predictive for our task.
  Results: This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the
outputs from an this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic
extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung
opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE.
  Conclusions: These results indicate that our model's ability to gauge
severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used for escalation or
de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in
the intensive care unit (ICU). A proper clinical trial is needed to evaluate
efficacy. To enable this we make our code, labels, and data available online at

different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics
influence a country's innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The
findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work
domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the
country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of
their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the
data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to
NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note
that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly
modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases
constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries
with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often

emergency should be supported by operational measures to avoid a second virus

significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with
infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial
masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards ""social distancing"") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built
environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate
occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and
exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations.
Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies
and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data
(""Diamond Princess"" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part
of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable
infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such
measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by
occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to
combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The
model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public
buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).

misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns
resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp
45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its

the proposed test to a data set of Twitter posts about COVID-19 pandemic: in a

significant for the rejection of the null hypothesis (the daily long-run
sentiment rate remains constant), but, taking into account the correlation
among data, the introduced test leads to a different conclusion. Beside the
statistical application, we point out that the GRP urn is a simple variant of
the standard Eggenberger-Polya urn, that, with suitable choices of the
parameters, shows ""local"" reinforcement, almost sure convergence of the
empirical mean to a deterministic limit and different asymptotic behaviours of
the predictive mean. Moreover, the study of this model provides the opportunity
to analyze stochastic approximation dynamics, that are unusual in the related

  COVID-19","Demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks,
gloves, and gowns has increased significantly since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic. In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to
wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required
to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical
procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had
problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge,
we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the
admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent
queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans
and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we
derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a
specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a
data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine
department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to
November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately
90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven
entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for
surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners
will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.

This is highlighted by the inefficiency of energy saving measures that have

  Stress from COVID-19","When facing an extreme stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare
systems typically respond reactively by creating surge capacity at facilities
that are at or approaching their baseline capacity. However, creating
individual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach,
and redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce
the total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly
distributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to
create surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is
this inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at
over-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal
demand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and
resource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze
a series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of
the demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand
uncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also
incorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers
may need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated
retrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and
Miami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative
to the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are
operationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In
summary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a
practical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly
care for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.

  Tracing Applications","Contact tracing is an important measure to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. In
the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the
rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is
cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large
number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital
contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact
tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements
and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact
tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed
that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better
controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the
collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption
rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy.
In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in
multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for
mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting
contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly
effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on
various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set
Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact
tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these

tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication
complexity expressions for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic

  Models with Applications to Forecasting Number of Deaths during the COVID-19
  Pandemic","Motivated by the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is
due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the important problem of forecasting daily
deaths and cumulative deaths, this paper examines the construction of
prediction regions or intervals under the Poisson regression model and for an
over-dispersed Poisson regression model. For the Poisson regression model,
several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared
through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of
forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to
COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened,
daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by
June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data
relative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression
model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival
Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The
Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson
regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion
parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number
of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is
presented. Finally, the paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and
mentions open research problems, as well as the dangers and pitfalls when
forecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic where events, both

thereby prevent new Covid-19 infections. In turn, it also reduced traffic and
industrial activities. But how much did these lockdown measures improve air
quality in large cities, and are there differences in how air quality was

Europe and Delhi as an example for Asia. We consider data during and before the
lockdown and compare these to a similar time period from 2019. Overall, we find
a reduction in almost all air pollutants with intriguing differences between
the two cities. In London, despite smaller average concentrations, we still
observe high-pollutant states and an increased tendency towards extreme events

results could help to design rules to improve long-term air quality in

are gravity activity centers orchestrating movement and mobility patterns in
cities. In a pandemic situation, urban hotspots could be potential
superspreader areas as visits to urban hotspots can increase the risk of
contact and transmission of a disease among a population. We mapped
origin-destination networks from census block groups to points of interest

approach to study movement patterns of visits to POIs among the hotspots and
non-hotspots from January to May 2020. Also, we conducted chi-square tests to
identify POIs with significant flux-in changes during the analysis period. The
results showed disparate patterns across cities in terms of reduction in POI
visits to hotspot areas. The sixteen cities are divided into two categories
based on visits to POIs in hotspot areas. In one category, which includes the
cities of, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago, we observe a considerable
decrease in visits to POIs in hotspot areas, while in another category,
including the cites of, Austin, Houston, and San Diego, the visits to hotspot
areas did not greatly decrease during the social distancing period. In

category maintained the proportion of visits to POIs in the hotspots. The
proportion of visits to some POIs (e.g., Restaurant and Other Eating Places)

COVID-19 contact tracing mobile apps. The main reported concerns are centered
around privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily
using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic
without similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better
understand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy
policies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used
COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract
and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that
Social Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and
ethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots
of people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their
privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the
other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared
to most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and
led users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that
in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists
will need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour
and trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps
and encourage them to download and use these apps. Moreover, COVID-19 apps need
many accessibility enhancements to allow a wider range of users from different
societies and cultures to access to these apps.

game theory and social network models should be used to guide decisions

following the introduction of vaccines, their availability and the human
resources needed to run the vaccination programs will likely be scarce in many
countries. Vaccine hesitancy can also be expected from some sections of the
general public. We emphasize that decision making under uncertainty and
imperfect information, and with only conditionally optimal outcomes, is a
unique forte of established game theoretic modelling. Therefore, we can use
this approach to obtain the best framework for modelling and simulating
vaccination prioritisation and uptake that will be readily available to inform
important policy decisions for the optimal control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  Approach","Selfie-based biometrics has great potential for a wide range of applications
from marketing to higher security environments like online banking. This is now
especially relevant since e.g. periocular verification is contactless, and
thereby safe to use in pandemics such as COVID-19. However, selfie-based
biometrics faces some challenges since there is limited control over the data
acquisition conditions. Therefore, super-resolution has to be used to increase
the quality of the captured images. Most of the state of the art
super-resolution methods use deep networks with large filters, thereby needing
to train and store a correspondingly large number of parameters, and making
their use difficult for mobile devices commonly used for selfie-based.
  In order to achieve an efficient super-resolution method, we propose an
Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution (ESISR) algorithm, which takes into
account a trade-off between the efficiency of the deep neural network and the
size of its filters. To that end, the method implements a novel loss function
based on the Sharpness metric. This metric turns out to be more suitable for
increasing the quality of the eye images. Our method drastically reduces the
number of parameters when compared with Deep CNNs with Skip Connection and
Network (DCSCN): from 2,170,142 to 28,654 parameters when the image size is
increased by a factor of x3. Furthermore, the proposed method keeps the sharp
quality of the images, which is highly relevant for biometric recognition
purposes. The results on remote verification systems with raw images reached an
Equal Error Rate (EER) of 8.7% for FaceNet and 10.05% for VGGFace. Where

the Wasserstein space closely related to its weak Riemannian structure, by
mapping the data to a suitable linear space and using a metric projection
operator to constrain the results in the Wasserstein space. By carefully
choosing the tangent point, we are able to derive fast empirical methods,
exploiting a constrained B-spline approximation. As a byproduct of our
approach, we are also able to derive faster routines for previous work on PCA
for distributions. By means of simulation studies, we compare our approaches to
previously proposed methods, showing that our projected PCA has similar
performance for a fraction of the computational cost and that the projected
regression is extremely flexible even under misspecification. Several
theoretical properties of the models are investigated and asymptotic
consistency is proven. Two real world applications to Covid-19 mortality in the

  rate","This paper aims to provide reliable estimates for the COVID-19 contact rate
of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. From observable data on
confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, a noisy measurement for the contact
rate can be constructed. To filter out measurement errors and seasonality, a
novel unobserved components (UC) model is set up. It specifies the log contact
rate as a latent, fractionally integrated process of unknown integration order.
The fractional specification reflects key characteristics of aggregate social
behavior such as strong persistence and gradual adjustments to new information.
A computationally simple modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is
termed the fractional filter. It allows to estimate UC models with richer
long-run dynamics, and provides a closed-form expression for the prediction
error of UC models. Based on the latter, a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS)
estimator for the model parameters is set up that is shown to be consistent and
asymptotically normally distributed. The resulting contact rate estimates for
several countries are well in line with the chronology of the pandemic, and
allow to identify different contact regimes generated by policy interventions.
As the fractional filter is shown to provide precise contact rate estimates at
the end of the sample, it bears great potential for monitoring the pandemic in
real time.

We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long

estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input
information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic
and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as
well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total
and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19
patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its
sub-regions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and
density. Without prior information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),
the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility
data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide
robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting
the regional-dependent results of releasing Stay-at-Home orders. The resulting
highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of
its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and

control strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the
susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination
control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible,
un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model
with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal
logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can
specify the expected control outcomes such as ""the deaths from the infection
should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months"" or ""the
population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within
the next 100 to 120 days"". We then develop methods for synthesizing control
strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the
COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation
results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19

immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from

  Patterns Detection in X-ray Images","Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, is nowadays one of the most prominent
challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus
propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The
standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to
the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening
methods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing
promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these
methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and
availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet
efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of
COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective
we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural
networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other
applications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a
hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed
approaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the
three classes were used to assess the quality of the methods. Results: The
results show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality
model, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and
positive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters

segmentation method to assist accurate quantification of COVID 19 pneumonia.
Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly
applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used, which are
the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower lungs. To improve the
segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating
five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical
relevance of the proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the
Quality of Lung Edema (RALE). Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed
dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods
(0.854 0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive

  COVID-19 disease","By the end of 2020, a year since the first cases of infection by the Covid-19
virus have been reported, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Several
pharmaceutical companies made significant progress in developing effective
vaccines against the Covid-19 virus that has claimed the lives of more than a
million people over the world. On the other hand, there is growing evidence of
re-infection by the virus, which can cause further outbreaks. In this paper, we
apply statistical physics tools to examine the vaccination rate required to
control the pandemic for three different vaccine efficiency scenarios. Also, we
study the effect of temporal restrictions/reliefs on the pandemic's outbreak,
assuming that re-infection is possible. When examining the efficiency of the
vaccination rate of the general population in preventing an additional outbreak
of the disease, we find that a high vaccination rate (where at least 0.3% of
the population is vaccinated daily, which is equivalent to ~ 1 million vaccine
doses in the United States daily) is required to gain control over the spread
of the virus without further restrictions. Due to feasible limitations on the
vaccination rate, the vaccination process should be accompanied by the
prevailing restrictions until most of the population is vaccinated.

COVID-19 outbreak thus far, and the next question is when and how to relax
these restrictions. A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups
is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health
risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to
mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations,
while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic
activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential
release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can
lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all
individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of
minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is
important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model
allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies,
which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and
planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and

  classification scenarios","The COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high
impact on the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for
pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. CXR are
useful in because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread than CT. This study
aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy
lungs using only CXR images. In order to achieve the objectives, we have
proposed a classification schema considering the multi-class and hierarchical
perspectives, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the
natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling
algorithms in order to re-balance the classes distribution. Our classification
schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also
using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion
techniques in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors
and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database,
named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different
pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution
follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than
others. The proposed approach achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a
multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in
the hierarchical classification scenario. As far as we know, we achieved the
best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced
environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel
proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers
the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the

is not fit for purpose. Yet despite the threat posed to the scientific
enterprise, there is no agreement concerning alternative approaches. This lack
of consensus reflects long-standing issues concerning Bayesian methods, the
principal alternative to NHST. We report on recent work that builds on an
approach to inference put forward over 70 years ago to address the well-known
""Problem of Priors"" in Bayesian analysis, by reversing the conventional
prior-likelihood-posterior (""forward"") use of Bayes's Theorem. Such
Reverse-Bayes analysis allows priors to be deduced from the likelihood by
requiring that the posterior achieve a specified level of credibility. We
summarise the technical underpinning of this approach, and show how it opens up
new approaches to common inferential challenges, such as assessing the
credibility of scientific findings, setting them in appropriate context,
estimating the probability of successful replications, and extracting more
insight from NHST while reducing the risk of misinterpretation. We argue that
Reverse-Bayes methods have a key role to play in making Bayesian methods more
accessible and attractive to the scientific community. As a running example we
consider a recently published meta-analysis from several randomized controlled
clinical trials investigating the association between corticosteroids and

coarse-grained models of gene expression control in systems biology. We apply
our approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection and

interplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, and
detection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces. More generally, our
results demonstrate that regional differences may drastically shape infection

governments have implemented a variety of policies to encourage compliance.
These typically rely on financial penalties (fines) and/or informational

distancing in a web-based interactive experiment. The study involves a
nearrepresentative sample of 400 participants from the US population, and it
was conducted in May 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Fines significantly
promote distancing, but nudges only have a marginal impact. Political ideology
also has a causal impact -- progressives are more likely to practice
distancing, and are marginally more responsive to fines. Further, individuals
do more social distancing when they know they may be a superspreader. Our
results highlight the crucial role of web-based interactive experiments in

a Data Assimilation approach is taken for $R_t$ estimation, resulting in the
state-of-the-art 'DAR$_t$' system for $R_t$ estimation. With DAR$_t$, the
problem of time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by
incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and
$R_t$; the drawback of averaging is improved by instantaneous updating upon new
observations and a model selection mechanism capturing abrupt changes caused by
interventions; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian
smoothing. We validate the performance of DAR$_t$ through simulations and
demonstrate its power in revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

public health interventions are critical for interrupting the spread of the
novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and mitigating morbidity and mortality caused by
coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Formulating a regional mechanistic model of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and frequently estimating parameters of this
model using streaming surveillance data offers one way to accomplish
data-driven decision making. For example, to detect an increase in new
SARS-CoV-2 infections due to relaxation of previously implemented mitigation
measures one can monitor estimates of the basic and effective reproductive
numbers. However, parameter estimation can be imprecise, and sometimes even
impossible, because surveillance data are noisy and not informative about all
aspects of the mechanistic model, even for reasonably parsimonious epidemic
models. To overcome this obstacle, at least partially, we propose a Bayesian
modeling framework that integrates multiple surveillance data streams. Our
model uses both COVID-19 incidence and mortality time series to estimate our
model parameters. Importantly, our data generating model for incidence data
takes into account changes in the total number of tests performed. We apply our
Bayesian data integration method to COVID-19 surveillance data collected in
Orange County, California. Our results suggest that California Department of
Public Health stay-at-home order, issued on March 19, 2020, lowered the
SARS-CoV-2 effective reproductive number $R_{e}$ in Orange County below 1.0,
which means that the order was successful in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections.
However, subsequent ""re-opening"" steps took place when thousands of infectious
individuals remained in Orange County, so $R_{e}$ increased to approximately
1.0 by mid-June and above 1.0 by mid-July.

variables. We exploit the exogeneity of global commodity prices, and three
variables that increase the risk of COVID-19 and efficiency in response such as
countries colonial heritage, male mortality rate attributed to air pollution
and prevalence of diabetes in adults. We find that the probability of
experiencing riots, violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food
looting has increased since lockdowns. Food vulnerability has been a
contributing factor. A 10% increase in the local price index is associated with
an increase of 0.7 percentage points in violence against civilians.
Nonetheless, for every additional anti-poverty measure implemented in response
to COVID-19 the probability of experiencing violence against civilians, riots
and food-related conflicts declines by approximately 0.2 percentage points.
These anti-poverty measures also reduce the number of fatalities associated

globally reported in 223 countries and regions, infected over 108 million
people and caused over 2.4 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/, accessed
on Feb. 17, 2021). Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an effective
approach to control and prevent the pandemic. However, many daily activities,
such as transporting goods in our daily life, inevitably involve
person-to-person contact. Using an autonomous logistic vehicle to achieve
contact-less goods transportation could alleviate this issue. For example, it
can reduce the risk of virus transmission between the driver and customers.
Moreover, many countries have imposed tough lockdown measures to reduce the
virus transmission (e.g., retail, catering) during the pandemic, which causes
inconveniences for human daily life. Autonomous vehicle can deliver the goods
bought by humans, so that humans can get the goods without going out. These
demands motivate us to develop an autonomous vehicle, named as Hercules, for

stimulated the development of network dilution methods and their analysis.
While the ability of $L_1$ and $L_0$ regularization to encourage sparsity is
often mentioned, $L_2$ regularization is seldom discussed in this context. We
present a novel framework for weight pruning by sampling from a probability
function that favors the zeroing of smaller weights. In addition, we examine
the contribution of $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization to the dynamics of node
pruning while optimizing for weight pruning. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed stochastic framework when used together with a
weight decay regularizer on popular classification models in removing 50% of
the nodes in an MLP for MNIST classification, 60% of the filters in VGG-16 for
CIFAR10 classification, and on medical image models in removing 60% of the
channels in a U-Net for instance segmentation and 50% of the channels in CNN
model for COVID-19 detection. For these node-pruned networks, we also present
competitive weight pruning results that are only slightly less accurate than
the original, dense networks.

viruses. Using realistic air flow simulation, we model droplet dispersion from
coughing and study the transmission risk related to SARS-CoV-2. Although most
airborne droplets are 8-16 $\mu$m in diameter, the droplets with the highest
transmission potential are, in fact, 32-40 $\mu$m. Use of face masks is
therefore recommended for both personal and social protection. We found social
distancing effective at reducing transmission potential across all droplet
sizes. However, the presence of a human body 1 m away modifies the aerodynamics
so that downstream droplet dispersion is enhanced, which has implications on
safe distancing in queues. Based on median viral load, we found that an average
of 0.55 viral copies is inhaled at 1 m distance per cough. Droplet evaporation
results in significant reduction in droplet counts, but airborne transmission
remains possible even under low humidity conditions.

  Contact Tracing","The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented demand for
effective methods to mitigate the spread of the disease, and various digital
contact tracing (DCT) methods have emerged as a component of the solution. In
order to make informed public health choices, there is a need for tools which
allow evaluation and comparison of DCT methods. We introduce an agent-based
compartmental simulator we call COVI-AgentSim, integrating detailed
consideration of virology, disease progression, social contact networks, and
mobility patterns, based on parameters derived from empirical research. We
verify by comparing to real data that COVI-AgentSim is able to reproduce
realistic COVID-19 spread dynamics, and perform a sensitivity analysis to
verify that the relative performance of contact tracing methods are consistent
across a range of settings. We use COVI-AgentSim to perform cost-benefit
analyses comparing no DCT to: 1) standard binary contact tracing (BCT) that
assigns binary recommendations based on binary test results; and 2) a
rule-based method for feature-based contact tracing (FCT) that assigns a graded
level of recommendation based on diverse individual features. We find all DCT
methods consistently reduce the spread of the disease, and that the advantage
of FCT over BCT is maintained over a wide range of adoption rates.
Feature-based methods of contact tracing avert more disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs) per socioeconomic cost (measured by productive hours lost). Our
results suggest any DCT method can help save lives, support re-opening of
economies, and prevent second-wave outbreaks, and that FCT methods are a
promising direction for enriching BCT using self-reported symptoms, yielding
earlier warning signals and a significantly reduced spread of the virus per
socioeconomic cost.

  Rate in an Infectious Disease like Covid-19","Covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damage
amounting to trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid development
of vaccine. Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question
on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely
focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk
groups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space,
which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate.
To demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describing
the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, for
infectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns,
locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers $R_0\sim 1.5-4$
the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations
compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to
the population density. For $R_0\sim 1$ we still find a significant increase of
the survival rate. The proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be further
tested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on the
importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official
guidelines.

  Informing Dissent, Disparities, and Dissemination","The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Little
is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the coming vaccines. We
adopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000
rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) to
capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying
them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We
aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major
changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to
the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the
pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using
multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital,
income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of
personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level
pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and
causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically
disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential
COVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the people
who have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conducting
counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about
the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines
for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine
acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based
study to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform
more effective vaccine distribution policies and strategies.

coronavirus has rapidly become pandemics, mainly due to its extremely high
human-to-human transmission capability, and a surprisingly high viral charge of
symptom-less people. While the seek of a vaccine is still ongoing, promising
results have been obtained with antiviral compounds. In particular, lactoferrin
is found to have beneficial effects both in preventing and soothing the
infection. Here, we explore the possible molecular mechanisms with which
lactoferrin interferes with SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion, preventing attachment
and/or entry of the virus. To this aim, we search for possible interactions
lactoferrin may have with virus structural proteins and host receptors.
Representing the molecular iso-electron surface of proteins in terms of
2D-Zernike descriptors, we (i) identified putative regions on the lactoferrin
surface able to bind sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane,
sheltering the cell from the virus attachment; (ii) showed that no significant
shape complementarity is present between lactoferrin and the ACE2 receptor,
while (iii) two high complementarity regions are found on the N- and C-terminal
domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, hinting at a possible competition
between lactoferrin and ACE2 for the binding to the spike protein.

  measures","In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of
asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to
contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the
population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by
separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep
working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group
consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to
quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.
In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of
contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in
time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an
explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms
of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we
can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the
epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic
scenarios. From the expression of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we
conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic
cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these
measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved.
Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce
their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to
maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.

in the United States (US). Consequently, relaxing NPIs through a phased
re-opening of the US amid still-high levels of COVID-19 susceptibility could
lead to new epidemic waves. This calls for a COVID-19 early warning system.
Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of
increasing or decreasing state-level US COVID-19 activity between January and
June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a
simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of
exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social
network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a
metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart
thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to
comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable
growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further
observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after
implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility
data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for
exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early
warning system for future COVID-19 outbreaks. These efforts represent an
initial exploratory framework, and both continued study of the predictive power
of digital indicators as well as further development of the statistical
approach are needed.

institutions with the closure of classroom teaching activities. In this
unprecedented crisis, of global proportion, educators and families had to deal
with unpredictability and learn new ways of teaching. This short essay aims to
explore the challenges posed to Portuguese higher education institutions and to
analyze the challenges posed to evaluation models. To this end, the relevance
of formative and summative assessment models in distance education is explored
and the perception of teachers and students about the practices adopted in
remote assessment is discussed. On the teachers' side, there is a high concern
about adopting fraud-free models, and an excessive focus on the summative
assessment component that in the distance learning model has less preponderance
when compared to the gradual monitoring and assessment processes of the
students, while on the students' side, problems arise regarding equipment to
follow the teaching sessions and concerns about their privacy, particularly
when intrusive IT solutions request the access to their cameras, audio, and
desktop.

Chinese, and English, about multiple countries - Iran, China, and the United
States (US), and on multiple platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
Weibo, and WhatsApp. Misinformation, especially about a global pandemic, is a
global problem yet it is common for studies of COVID-19 misinformation on
social media to focus on a single language, like English, a single country,
like the US, or a single platform, like Twitter. We utilized opportunistic
sampling to compile 200 specific items of viral and yet debunked misinformation

August 31. We then categorized this collection based both on the topics of the
misinformation and the underlying roots of that misinformation. Our
multi-cultural and multilingual team observed that the nature of COVID-19
misinformation on social media varied in substantial ways across different
languages/countries depending on the cultures, beliefs/religions, popularity of
social media, types of platforms, freedom of speech and the power of people
versus governments. We observe that politics is at the root of most of the
collected misinformation across all three languages in this dataset. We further
observe the different impact of government restrictions on platforms and
platform restrictions on content in Iran, China, and the US and their impact on
a key question of our age: how do we control misinformation without silencing
the voices we need to hold governments accountable?

plays a crucial regulatory role in the conformational changes of the S protein.
The complete RBD structural transition is allowed only when the neighboring NTD

away. Based on this NTD ""wedge"" model, we propose that the NTD-RBD interface

In order to understand that how and during which period of time do the
meteorological factors have the strongest association with the transmission and
fatality of COVID-19, we analyze the correlation between each meteorological
factor during different time periods within the incubation window and the
confirmation and fatality rate, and develop statistic models to quantify the
effects at county level. Results show that meteorological variables except
maximum wind speed during the day 13 - 0 before current day shows the most
significant correlation (P < 0.05) with the daily confirmed rate, while
temperature during the day 13 - 8 before are most significantly correlated (P <

  boom in medical research and ultimately digital twins?","After being collected for patient care, Observational Health Data (OHD) can
further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health
informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the
fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a
groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial
sectors, and medical imaging.
  The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying
disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to
common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases,
and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the
healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data
related for the reasons stated above.
  Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to
be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly
reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the
properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms
(unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly
transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.
  We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in
2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and
we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data
modelling, and reproducibility.

worldwide that was responding with a sudden shift to distance learning. Various
physics courses such as lectures, tutorials, and the laboratories had to be
transferred into online formats rapidly, resulting in a variety of
simultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics
students perceived the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a
questionnaire and gathered data from N = 578 physics students from five
universities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how
the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how
students' judge different formats of the courses and how useful and effective
they perceive them. The results are correlated to the students' self-efficacy
ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills)
and demographics. In a related article, we focus on the online physics lectures
and compare simultaneous vs. asynchronous teaching and learning methods (n.n.).
We find that good communication abilities and self-organization skills are
positively correlated for perceived learning achievement. Furthermore, the
previous duration of studies had a significant impact on the students'
perceived overall learning achievement, on the students' acquisition of
experimental skills during the physics laboratories, and on their assessment of
the recitations' effectiveness. That is, students in their first academic year
show consistently lower scores than more progressed students. For the physics
laboratories, it was found that gathering real data was crucial to the
acquisition of experimental skills and the reinforcement of content. For the
physics recitations, handing in own solutions for feedback was correlated with
perceived effectiveness. We draw conclusions and implications for future online
classes.

validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control
policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to
simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more

that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a
reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant

interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and
safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are
inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social
distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing
that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the

number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of
social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social

forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and
mitigation strategies. A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the
assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first
interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model
with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth
rate of new infections. Focusing on the COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect
change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times
of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can quantify the effect of
interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into
forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers. Our code is freely available

distinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set
up under general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent,
queuing systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with
time-varying transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper.
Although more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for
exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also
significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar
level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a
sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's
occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose
a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a
balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate
the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess
the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is
possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as
the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.

when taking decisions about their young children, and likely also when advising
other family members such as elderly relatives. Minimizing malignant online
influences is therefore crucial to securing their assent for policies ranging
from vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, to
household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G
towers nearby. Here we show how a strengthening of bonds across online
communities during the pandemic, has led to non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories
(e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstream
parent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduits
between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more
palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these
inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective
of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why
Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of
non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why
targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable
and empirically grounded mathematical model, shows how modest tailoring of
mainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping against
establishment guidance. Our conclusions should also apply to other social media
platforms and topics.

coronavirus diseases across the world. These outbreaks often led to respiratory
tract diseases and have proved to be fatal sometimes. Currently, we are facing
an elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the
coronavirus family. One of the modes of transmission of COVID- 19 is airborne
transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets
released by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing,
or sneezing. Hence, public health officials have mandated the use of face masks
which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs,
commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents
an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human
faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are
forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same
problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately
identifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a
ResNet-50 based architecture that performs well at recognizing masked faces.
The outcome of this study could be seamlessly integrated into existing face

model of fractional order in time to analyze the evolution of the epidemic in
Buenos Aires and neighboring areas (Regi\'on Metropolitana de Buenos Aires,

are divided into four classes, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected
(I) and recovered (R). The SEIR model of fractional order allows for the
incorporation of memory, with hereditary properties of the system, being a
generalization of the classic SEIR first-order system, where such effects are
ignored. Furthermore, the fractional model provides one additional parameter to
obtain a better fit of the data. The parameters of the model are calibrated by
using as data the number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite
solutions honour the data, we show a set of cases with different values of the
lockdown parameters, fatality rate, and incubation and infectious periods. The
different reproduction ratios R0 and infection fatality rates (IFR) so obtained
indicate the results may differ from recent reported values, constituting
possible alternative solutions. A comparison with results obtained with the

multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including
people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has
changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and
quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at
international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international
level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has
plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of
flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United
States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating
countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March
10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major
city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).
Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We
also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of
posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in
the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram
doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among

(logistic) Fermi-Dirac-like function to describe the spread of Covid-19. Our
analysis reinforces well-established literature results, namely: \emph{i}) that
the epidemic curves can be described by a Gaussian-type function; \emph{ii})
that the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and
fatalities follow a logistic function, which has some resemblance with a
distorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; \emph{iii}) the key role played by the
quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an \emph{interacting}
parameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected people.
Furthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that:
\emph{i}) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of
a person being infected with Covid-19; \emph{ii}) the concepts of blocked and
non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person
respecting or not the social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of
an infected person to infect other people. Increasing the number of infected
people leads to an increase in the number of net connections, giving rise thus
to a higher probability of new infections (percolation). We demonstrate the
importance of social distancing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a
pedagogical way. Given the impossibility of making a precise forecast of the
disease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional
factors, such as climate changes and urbanization, in the mathematical
description of epidemics. Yet, we make a connection between the standard
mathematical models employed in epidemics and well-established concepts in

  Distancing Policies in Brazil","The global COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defining health crisis
of our century. Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight
it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social
distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this
context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine
the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in
the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number
of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the
absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic
individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an
uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and
inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model
an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to
the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the
speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical
formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or
the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to
avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation
results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These
results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August
2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the
beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days.

streamline patient diagnosis and management has become more pressing than ever.
As one of the main imaging tools, chest X-rays (CXRs) are common, fast,
non-invasive, relatively cheap, and potentially bedside to monitor the
progression of the disease. This paper describes the first public COVID-19
image data collection as well as a preliminary exploration of possible use
cases for the data. This dataset currently contains hundreds of frontal view
X-rays and is the largest public resource for COVID-19 image and prognostic
data, making it a necessary resource to develop and evaluate tools to aid in
the treatment of COVID-19. It was manually aggregated from publication figures
as well as various web based repositories into a machine learning (ML) friendly
format with accompanying dataloader code. We collected frontal and lateral view
imagery and metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive care unit
(ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location. We
present multiple possible use cases for the data such as predicting the need
for the ICU, predicting patient survival, and understanding a patient's
trajectory during treatment. Data can be accessed here:

time after becoming infected. The studies show that carriers with mild or no
symptoms are the main contributors to the transmission of a virus within the
population. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms causes a delay in
the spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on
the disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the
time-delay and the network topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably
different in time, duration, and intensity. Motivated by the recent worldwide
outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which this virus
has spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the
effect of time-delay in the progress of such infectious diseases in the
meta-population networks rather than individuals or a single population. In
this regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the
underlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties,
and symptom development duration are investigated to establish a
centrality-based analysis of the disease evolution. A convex traffic volume
optimization method is then developed to control the outbreak. The control
process is done by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality
and then isolating them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume
(motivated by economic considerations) in the meta-population level. The
numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the
impact of time-delay as well as the importance of considering the worst-case
scenarios in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.

  Domain Adaptation","Due to the shortage of COVID-19 viral testing kits and the long waiting time,
radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage
patients into different risk levels. Deep learning based methods have taken an
active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images,
as witnessed in many recent works in early 2020. Most of these works first
train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest
x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much
smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains
may lead to poor performance for CNN due to two issues, the large domain shift
present in the biomedical imaging datasets and the extremely small scale of the
COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these two important
issues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification
in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel
domain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network
(SODA). SODA is able to align the data distributions across different domains
in a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target
data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance
compared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common
pneumonia. We also present initial results showing that SODA can produce better
pathology localizations in the chest x-rays.

  post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India","Several countries that have been successful in constraining the severity of
COVID-19 pandemic via ""lockdown"" are now considering to slowly end it, mainly
because of enormous socio-economic side-effects. An abrupt ending of lockdown
can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore,
carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post
upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social
contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and
Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with
fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet
and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase
in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth
of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown
phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools
for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical
intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed
SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear
conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country
specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.

  to flatten the curve of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan","This paper presents the assessment of time-dependent national-level
restrictions and control actions and their effects in fighting the COVID-19
pandemic. By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of
COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control
actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood.
This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control
the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic
population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into
consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters,
especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one
of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this
pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model
can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical
optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in
the news platforms. In this paper, the model is verified using a case study
based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in
simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints)
parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with
time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the
actual situations better.

disruptions to many aspects of normal life. An important aspect in reducing the
impact of the pandemic is to control its spread. Studies have shown that one
effective method in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 is to wear masks.
Strict mask-wearing policies have been met with not only public sensation but
also practical difficulty. We cannot hope to manually check if everyone on a
street is wearing a mask properly. Existing technology to help automate mask
checking uses deep learning models on real-time surveillance camera footages.
The current dominant method to perform real-time mask detection uses Mask-RCNN
with ResNet as the backbone. While giving good detection results, this method
is computationally intensive and its efficiency in real-time face mask
detection is not ideal. Our research proposes a new approach to mask detection
by replacing Mask-R-CNN with a more efficient model ""YOLO"" to increase the
processing speed of real-time mask detection and not compromise on accuracy.
Besides, given the small volume as well as extreme imbalance of the mask
detection datasets, we adopt a latest progress made in few-shot visual
classification, simple CNAPs, to improve the classification performance.

  SARS-CoV","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic clock is ticking and the survival of many
of mankind's modern institutions and or survival of many individuals is at
stake. There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as
SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified;
those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice.
  Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three
svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment
algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment
scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches as much as the other
mutations. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can
bind to U, hence, our scoring. We also validate this hypothesis using a novel,
independent computational experiment. To validate our results, we confirmed the
discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the tested publicly available
genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2
orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also
report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered
orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore,
antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.

  chest X-ray images via novel Pinball-OCSVM","It is evident that the infection with this severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) starts with the upper respiratory tract and as the
virus grows, the infection can progress to lungs and develop pneumonia.
According to the statistics, approximately 14\% of the infected people with
COVID-19 have severe cough and shortness of breath due to pneumonia, because as
the viral infection increases, it damages the alveoli (small air sacs) and
surrounding tissues. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive
during early stages specially, if the patient is asymptomatic that may further
lead to more severe pneumonia. To overcome this problem an early diagnosis
method is proposed in this paper via one-class classification approach using a
novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM)
considering posteroanterior chest X-ray images. Recently, several automated
COVID-19 diagnosis models have been proposed based on various deep learning
architectures to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest
X-ray (CXR) where the presence of less number of COVID-19 positive samples
compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the
challenge for unbiased learning in deep learning models that has been solved
using class balancing techniques which however should be avoided in any medical
diagnosis process. Inspired by this phenomenon, this article proposes a novel
PB-OCSVM model to work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples
with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency while minimize the
false-positive and false-negative predictions. The proposed model outperformed
over recently published deep learning approaches where accuracy, precision,
specificity and sensitivity are used as performance measure parameters.

  Neural Networks based on PCA","The capital market plays a vital role in marketing operations for aerospace
industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market
and many cyclical factors, the stock prices of listed aerospace companies
fluctuate significantly. This makes the share price prediction challengeable.
To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well
understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a
hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks. We investigated two types of aerospace
industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA
could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could
influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted
features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The
selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical
features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas
fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation.
The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different
types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term
historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical
data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an
intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the
financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies

improving the return on investment. Currently, COVID-19 severely influences

forward shift in mortality, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic by looking at
the excess mortality trends of an area that registered one of the highest death
tolls in the world during the first wave, Northern Italy. We do not find any
evidence of a sizable COVID-19 harvesting effect, neither in the summer months
after the slowdown of the first wave nor at the beginning of the second wave.
According to our estimates, only a minor share of the total excess deaths
detected in Northern Italian municipalities over the entire period under
scrutiny (February - November 2020) can be attributed to an anticipatory role
of COVID-19. A slightly higher share is detected for the most severely affected
areas (the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, in particular), but even in these
territories, the harvesting effect can only account for less than 20% of excess
deaths. Furthermore, the lower mortality rates observed in these areas at the
beginning of the second wave may be due to several factors other than a
harvesting effect, including behavioral change and some degree of temporary
herd immunity. The very limited presence of short-run mortality displacement
restates the case for containment policies aimed at minimizing the health
impacts of the pandemic.

2020), COVID-19 has been spreading out to over 180 countries and territories.
As of June 18, 2020, in total, there are now over 8,400,000 cases and over
450,000 related deaths. This causes massive losses in the economy and jobs
globally and confining about 58% of the global population. In this paper, we
introduce SenWave, a novel sentimental analysis work using 105+ million
collected tweets and Weibo messages to evaluate the global rise and falls of
sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make a fine-grained analysis on the
feeling when we face this global health crisis, we annotate 10K tweets in
English and 10K tweets in Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic,
thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official
report, and joking. We then utilize an integrated transformer framework, called
simpletransformer, to conduct multi-label sentimental classification by
fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on the labeled data. Meanwhile, in
order for a more complete analysis, we also translate the annotated English
tweets into different languages (Spanish, Italian, and French) to generated
training data for building sentiment analysis models for these languages.
SenWave thus reveals the sentiment of global conversation in six different
languages on COVID-19 (covering English, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and
Chinese), followed the spread of the epidemic. The conversation showed a
remarkably similar pattern of rapid rise and slow decline over time across all
nations, as well as on special topics like the herd immunity strategies, to
which the global conversation reacts strongly negatively. Overall, SenWave
shows that optimistic and positive sentiments increased over time, foretelling
a desire to seek, together, a reset for an improved COVID-19 world.

implemented in different parts of the world. However, despite government
recommendations and mandates, a progressive increase in mobility was observed
in several sites. This phenomenon is often referred to as ""quarantine fatigue"".
Mathematical models have been used for more than a century to study the
dynamics of diseases spread. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large
number of models have been developed to investigate different aspects of the
pandemic. The aim of the present work has been to design and explore a
mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with quarantine fatigue. A
deterministic model represented by a system of differential equations, based on
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was developed. The model was
explored by means of computational simulations. The results obtained show that,
in some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a second
peak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have
contributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in
different parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations
performed also showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other
parameters related to propagation dynamics. The developed model is relatively
simple and has important limitations for performing accurate predictions in the

COVID-19 pandemic, and has been widely adopted in Europe and North America. We
estimate the value of disease avoidance using an epidemiological model that
projects the spread of COVID-19 across rich and poor countries. Social
distancing measures that ""flatten the curve"" of the disease to bring demand
within the capacity of healthcare systems are predicted to save many lives in
high-income countries, such that practically any economic cost is worth
bearing. These social distancing policies are estimated to be less effective in
poor countries with younger populations less susceptible to COVID-19, and more
limited healthcare systems, which were overwhelmed before the pandemic.
Moreover, social distancing lowers disease risk by limiting people's economic
opportunities. Poorer people are less willing to make those economic
sacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns
compared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic
benefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies
may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the
informal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves
and sacrifice economic opportunities until the virus passes. By limiting their
ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger,
deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity. Rather than a blanket
adoption of social distancing measures, we advocate for the exploration of

  pandemic","Purpose: This paper proposes a methodology and a computational tool to study
the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world and to perform a trend analysis to
assess its local dynamics.
  Methods: Mathematical functions are employed to describe the number of cases
and demises in each region and to predict their final numbers, as well as the
dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date. The model
parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical
optimization. Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public
policies. Easy to interpret metrics over the quality of the fitted curves are
provided. Country-wise data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) concerning the daily number of cases and demises around the
world are used, as well as detailed data from Johns Hopkins University and from
the Brasil.io project describing individually the occurrences in United States
counties and in Brazilian states and cities, respectively. U. S. and Brazil
were chosen for a more detailed analysis because they are the current foci of
the pandemic.
  Results: Illustrative results for different countries, U. S. counties and
Brazilian states and cities are presented and discussed.
  Conclusion: The main contributions of this work lie in (i) a straightforward
model of the curves to represent the data, which allows automation of the
process without requiring interventions from experts; (ii) an innovative
approach for trend analysis, whose results provide important information to
support authorities in their decision-making process; and (iii) the developed
computational tool, which is freely available and allows the user to quickly
update the COVID-19 analyses and forecasts for any country, United States
county or Brazilian state or city present in the periodic reports from the
authorities.

death counts. The total number of clusters and individual countries' cluster

cases and deaths. The changing number of clusters of the case counts precedes
that of the death counts by 32 days. On the other hand, there is an optimal
offset of 16 days with respect to the greatest consistency between cluster
groupings, determined by a new method of comparing affinity matrices. With this
offset in mind, we identify anomalous countries in the progression from
COVID-19 cases to deaths. This analysis can aid in highlighting the most and
least significant public policies in minimizing a country's COVID-19 mortality

viral diseases. This has accelerated the efforts to model and forecast the
disease spreading, in order to find ways to confine the spreading regionally
and between regions. Towards this we have devised a model of geographical
spreading of viral infections due to human spatial mobility and adapted it to
the latest COVID-19 pandemic. In this the region to be modelled is overlaid
with a two-dimensional grid weighted with the population density defined cells,
in each of which a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations
simulate the local dynamics (microdynamics) of the disease. The infections
between cells are stochastic and allow for the geographical spreading of the
virus over the two-dimensional space (macrodynamics). This approach allows to
separate the parameters related to the biological aspects of the disease from
the ones that represent the spatial contagious behaviour through different
kinds of mobility of people acting as virus carriers. These provide sufficient
information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In
particular we have applied this approach to three in many ways different
countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland and found that the model is capable of
reproducing and predicting the stochastic global path of the pandemic. This
study sheds light on how the diverse cultural and socioeconomic aspects of a
country influence the evolution of the epidemics and also the efficacy of
social distancing and other confinement measures.

for further diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Due to the complex
shapes and varied appearances of lesions, a large number of voxel-level labeled

a main bottleneck for developing deep learning based medical image segmentation

framework by embedding the Generative Adversarial training process into the
Segmentation Network, which is called GASNet. GASNet is optimized to segment
the lesion areas of a COVID-19 CT by the segmenter, and to replace the abnormal
appearance with a generated normal appearance by the generator, so that the
restored CT volumes are indistinguishable from healthy CT volumes by the
discriminator. GASNet is supervised by chest CT volumes of many healthy and
COVID-19 subjects without voxel-level annotations. Experiments on three public
databases show that when using as few as one voxel-level labeled sample, the
performance of GASNet is comparable to fully-supervised segmentation algorithms
trained on dozens of voxel-level labeled samples.

  Treating COVID-19 Lung Damage","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high fatality rates, especially
for patients who suffer from underlying health issues. One of the more serious
symptoms exhibited from patients suffering from an acute COVID-19 infection is
breathing difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the
excessive fluid (cellular leakage and cytokine storm) and mucoid debris that
have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant tension resulting in heavy
and stiff lungs. In this paper, we propose the use of micro-bubbles filled with
exosomes that can be released upon exposure to ultrasound signals as possible
rescue therapy in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have shown
that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for patients who have
suffered from viral infection. We have conducted simulations to show the
efficacy of the ultrasound signals that will penetrate through layers of
tissues reaching the alveoli that contain the micro-bubbles. Our results have
shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required to oscillate
and rupture the polymer-based micro-bubbles. Our proposed system can be used
for patients who require immediate rescue treatments for lung damage, as well
as for recovered patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where
the micro-bubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic window until
they are exposed to the ultrasound signals.

Concerning the novelty of the disease, the diagnostic methods based on
radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic
centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use
machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.
  Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases
of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020
Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning,

ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: This review study provides an
overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of

extraordinary capacity to achieve an accurate and efficient system for the

deduce a generalized framework to assess the relative airborne transmission
risk with respect to other modes. This is due to the complex biophysics
entailed in such phenomena. Since the SARS outbreak in 2002, Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been one of the main tools scientists used to
investigate AT of respiratory viruses. Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive
and physically plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand
SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission patterns. In addition to validation
requirements, for any CFD model to be of epistemic value to the scientific
community; it must be reproducible. In 2020, more than 45 published studies
investigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using CFD.
Here, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss
their reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using
a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD
simulations of SARS-CoV-2 AT. The proposed index $(0 \leq R^{CFD}_j \leq 1)$
relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent
the possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of
23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index $(R^{CFD}_j\geq 0.9)$
while the remaining 87% were found generally irreproducible $(R^{CFD}_j<0.9)$.
Without reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will
remain hindered, fragmented and limited. In conclusion, I call the scientific
community to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and publishing CFD
simulations in COVID-19 research.

Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different

the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and
developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage
of in-situ data. Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution
satellites and merged products of air pollutants, we analyze the air quality
across the globe and quantify the improvement resulting from the suppressed

combined effects of network clustering and adaptivity on epidemic spreading. We
address the question concerning the choice of optimal mechanism for most
effective prohibiting disease propagation in a connected network: adaptive
clustering, which mimics self-isolation (SI) in local communities, or sharp
instant clustering, which looks like frontiers closing (FC) between cities and
countries. SI-networks are ""adaptively grown"" under condition of maximization
of small cliques in the entire network, while FC-networks are ""instantly
created"". Running the standard SIR model on clustered SI- and FC-networks, we
demonstrate that the adaptive network clustering prohibits the epidemic
spreading better than the instant clustering in the network with similar
parameters. We found that SI model has scale-free property for degree
distribution $P(k)\sim k^{\eta}$ with small critical exponent $-2<\eta<-1$ and
argue that scale-free behavior emerges due to the randomness in the initial

  Detection","We propose `Tapestry', a novel approach to pooled testing with application to
COVID-19 testing with quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) that can result in shorter testing time and conservation of
reagents and testing kits. Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and
combinatorial group testing with a novel noise model for RT-PCR used for
generation of synthetic data. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the
input is a quantitative readout from each test and the output is a list of
viral loads for each sample relative to the pool with the highest viral load.
While other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay, Tapestry
obtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing, at
clinically acceptable false positive or false negative rates. We also propose
designs for pooling matrices that facilitate good prediction of the infected
samples while remaining practically viable. When testing $n$ samples out of
which $k \ll n$ are infected, our method needs only $O(k \log n)$ tests when
using random binary pooling matrices, with high probability. However, we also
use deterministic binary pooling matrices based on combinatorial design ideas
of Kirkman Triple Systems to balance between good reconstruction properties and
matrix sparsity for ease of pooling. In practice, we have observed the need for
fewer tests with such matrices than with random pooling matrices. This makes
Tapestry capable of very large savings at low prevalence rates, while
simultaneously remaining viable even at prevalence rates as high as 9.5\%.
Empirically we find that single-round Tapestry pooling improves over two-round
Dorfman pooling by almost a factor of 2 in the number of tests required. We
validate Tapestry in simulations and wet lab experiments with oligomers in
quantitative RT-PCR assays. Lastly, we describe use-case scenarios for
deployment.

COVID-19 with temporary immunity on finite spatial and non-spatial network
models. In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a
scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a
temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary
immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again.
When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model
three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the
epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on
maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a
finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of
the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of ""herd immunity"".
For each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which
this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to
flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as
decrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic.
However, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price
for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the
maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first
peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly,
interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach
equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that
network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not
captured by the continuous compartmental models.

imaging and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been also used for
classification of CT images. We propose a light CNN design based on the model
of the SqueezeNet, for the efficient discrimination of COVID-19 CT images with

is very competitive with respect to more complex CNN designs, thus allowing its
usability also on medium power computers. In the next future we aim at
improving the performances of the method along two directions: 1) by increasing

behavior change in people's responses to infectious disease outbreaks
(particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we propose a heterogeneous
Disease-Behavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model, in which people's risk
of getting infected is influenced by information diffusion, behavior change,

Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion
influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and
adopt self-protection, and subsequently affects disease transmission by
changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a
central role in epidemic prevention; (b) a reasonable fraction of
""over-reacting"" nodes are needed in epidemic prevention; (c) R0 has different
effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection;
(d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic
outbreak size. This research indicates that the media and opinion leaders
should not understate the transmissibility and severity of diseases to ensure
that people could become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection to
protect themselves and the whole population.

effective alternative to traditional labor intensive contact tracing methods.
However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede
wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely
on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal for example,
ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the
environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact
tracing. A new system concept, called PrivyTRAC, preserves user privacy,
increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing.
PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct
self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user
information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally
identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are
processed anonymized and aggregated locations of confirmed patients. The risk
maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the
accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper
illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity based methods in terms of
true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk
estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from
contacts of confirmed cases is also described.

augmented the real training dataset with a synthetic training dataset drawn

electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic
effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple
decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining
charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration
efficiency post decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on
the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and

identical entities (events, people, locations, etc.). Using hundreds of
thousands of data samples, a 2.8% increase in polarization was measured during
times of crisis compared to times where no crises were occurring. Regardless of
the reasoning that the gap between political parties can increase so much
during times of suffering and stress, it is definitely alarming to see that
among other aspects of life, the partisan gap worsens during detrimental

means of teaching mathematics, this paper deliberately does not want to propose
a novel pedagogical concept of how to teach mathematics, but rather presents a

mathematics is a dynamic creative process that requires the physical presence
of students in the lecture hall as audience so that the professor can
instantaneously fine-tune the evolution of the lecture according to his/her
perception of the level of attention and the facial expressions of the
students. The third assumption of this paper is that students need to have the
possibility to interact with each other personally. We report on the necessary

  interventions using compartment models: the PyRoss library","PyRoss is an open-source Python library that offers an integrated platform
for inference, prediction and optimisation of NPIs in age- and
contact-structured epidemiological compartment models. This report outlines the
rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations
and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss
library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as
master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run
transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental
subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and
allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and
forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as
available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be
weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact
of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological
data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to
optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are
included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed
populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments
structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes
relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such
compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be
combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,

  COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The infection fatality rate (IFR) of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. Using
German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates from
multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent
variations in effective IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different
methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged
IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and
time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of
confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected
individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark
figures of infections. Results show that effective IFRs in Germany are
estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions of confirmed cases and
estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In
particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and
autumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution
of confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR
estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is
estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and
time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs
indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in
observed mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of
infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective IFRs and observed
CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while a moderately increasing
gap can be observed during the second wave. Further research is warranted to
obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates.

prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and
informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to
control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on
turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual
Susceptible-Exposed- Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of
differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed
daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to
the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases

model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in
Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to
be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals,
essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare
aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on
flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation

  communities","In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the
pandemic due to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 disease and develop a
susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model that provides a theoretical framework
to investigate its spread within a community. Here, the model is based upon the
well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a
total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of
susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we
show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we
investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse
significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities,
represented by countries and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can
provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in
communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance
of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as
it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable
predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020,
the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of
strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters
related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected
and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data
with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of
COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper
restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates

  recursive contact tracing","The challenges presented by the COVID-19 epidemic have created a renewed
interest in the development of new methods to combat infectious diseases. A
prominent property of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is the significant fraction
of asymptomatic transmission. This may influence the effectiveness of the
standard contact tracing procedure for quarantining potentially infected
individuals. However, the effects of asymptomatic transmission on the epidemic
threshold of epidemic spreading on networks are largely unknown. Here we study
the critical percolation transition in a simple epidemic network model in the
presence of a recursive contact tracing algorithm for instant quarantining. We
find that, above a certain fraction of asymptomatic transmission, standard
contact tracing loses its ability to suppress spreading below the epidemic
threshold. However, we also find that recursive contact tracing opens a
possibility to contain epidemics with a large fraction of asymptomatic or
presymptomatic transmission. In particular, we calculate the required fraction
of network nodes participating in the contact tracing for networks with
arbitrary degree distributions and for varying recursion depths and discuss the
influence of recursion depth and asymptomatic rate on the epidemic percolation
phase transition. We test and illustrate our theoretical results using
numerical simulations on infection trees and networks. We anticipate recursive
contact tracing to provide a basis for digital, app-based contact tracing tools
that extend the efficiency of contact tracing to diseases with a large fraction
of asymptomatic transmission.

diseases. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus also termed Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which is considered to be
a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a high false-negative
rate. Therefore, the research community is exploring alternative diagnostic
mechanisms. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a feasible and
effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this work, we propose
the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class classification problem
namely COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. We propose a three-stage framework,
named COV-ELM based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Our dataset comprises
CXR images in a frontal view, namely Poster anterior (PA) and Erect
anteroposterior (AP). Stage one deals with preprocessing and transformation,
stage 2 deals with the challenge of extracting relevant features which are
passed as input to the ELM at the third stage, resulting in the identification
of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in this work has been motivated by its
significantly shorter training time as compared to conventional gradient-based
learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become available, it can be
quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models. We use
10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the results of applying COV-ELM. The
COV-ELM achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity

system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For development, we used a
de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in

international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these
datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2

results suggest that the AI system generalizes to new patient populations and

cases, the turnaround time for abnormal cases reduced by 7-28%. These results
represent an important step towards evaluating whether AI can be safely used to
flag cases in a general setting where previously unseen abnormalities exist.

people globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many
therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or
therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells plays
critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to
identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and
drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially
effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify these
potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as a
potentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic
discovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first
identified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infection
caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of the
altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway
analysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were
identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT,
IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly
identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of
potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and
reverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in the
prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly
reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. The
results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling
pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for
COVID-19 treatment.

transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protective
measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of
time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a
robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all
US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the
daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual
to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community. We found that
shortening by $5\%$ of the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around
$39\%$ (or $78$K, $95\%$ CI: $[66$K $, 89$K $]$) of the COVID-19 associated
deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our findings also indicate that
reducing infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more
pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number close to 1,
suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures,
such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission
rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level map for local officials
to determine optimal policy responses and for the public to better understand
the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 on each day.

  Times of Social Distancing","To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus on college campuses, a common
strategy for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 terms has been to offer instruction
weighted toward hybrid or fully online modalities. Colleges are now considering
whether and how to expand hybrid or fully in-person instruction for future
terms, and learn lessons from this experience for future use. Our paper uses
Fall 2019 enrollment data for a medium-sized public American university to
analyze whether some student groupings by class standing or course level are
more susceptible to the spread of infectious disease through academic
enrollment networks. Replicating Weeden and Cornwell [8], we find that
enrollment networks at the institution are ""small worlds"" characterized by high
clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent connections.
Connectivity decreases as class standing (graduate vs. undergraduate; senior
vs. freshman) and course level increase; as students move from generalized to
specialized course loads, networks cluster by major. Holding other factors
constant, policies focusing on in-person instruction for lower division
students conflict with the greater risk of infectious spread through a lower
division network in the absence of additional steps to minimize academic
connectivity. There are academic and financial incentives for emphasizing the
freshman experience, including concerns about student attrition from the first
to second academic year and recouping costs of infrastructure investments in
dormitories. Possible solutions could include (i) restricting face-to-face or
hybrid instruction to courses in students' academic majors, which would disrupt
larger networks into smaller ones and thus restrict the spread of infection
across majors, and (ii) take a ""scalpel"" approach to instruction modes by
moving online courses most likely to facilitate epidemic spread.

This is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce

including US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with
the US having the worst performance. Furthermore, Iran and South Korea are
likely to experience the second wave of the pandemic. A real-time exercise show
that the proposed structure delivers timely and precise information on the
current stance of the pandemic ahead of the competitors that use rolling
window. This, in turn, transforms into accurate short-term predictions of the
active cases. We further modify the model to allow for unreported cases.
Results suggest that the effects of the presence of these cases on the

country, race, religion, and economy. The current gold standard method for
COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and
violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a
while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these
limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of
COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory
sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful
insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper
presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called
Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound
samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application.
The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving,
the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that
insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based
technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and
in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.

infected by COVID-19. The masks of these two parts of images then were
converted to corresponding volumes to calculate the physical proportion of

studied. The intrinsic Hounsfiled value of CT images was firstly utilized to
generate the initial dirty version of labeled masks both for intact lung and
infected regions. Then, the samples were carefully adjusted and improved by two
professional radiologists to generate the final training set and test
benchmark. Two deep learning models were evaluated: UNet and 2.5D UNet. For the
segment of infected regions, a deep learning based classifier was followed to
remove unrelated blur-edged regions that were wrongly segmented out such as air
tube and blood vessel tissue etc. For the segmented masks of intact lung and
infected regions, the best method could achieve 0.972 and 0.757 measure in mean
Dice similarity coefficient on our test benchmark. As the overall proportion of
infected region of lung, the final result showed 0.961 (Pearson's correlation
coefficient) and 11.7% (mean absolute percent error). The instant proportion of

  Takeaways From the Initial Phase of The COVID-19 Infodemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been damaging to the lives of people all around the

uncontrolled spreading of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may
severely change the pandemic's course by interfering with public health
interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In
particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it
holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents
findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the
COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations' susceptibility to false
claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on
responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a
strong association between perceived believability of misinformation and
vaccination hesitancy. Additionally, our study shows that only half of the
online users exposed to rumors might have seen the fact-checked information.
Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals
considered these rumors believable. Our survey also shows that poorer regions
are more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation. We
discuss implications of our findings on public campaigns that proactively
spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the
infodemic. We also highlight fact-checking platforms' role in better
identifying and prioritizing claims that are perceived to be believable and
have wide exposure. Our findings give insights into better handling of risk

addressed are these: 1. Can mask use by the general population limit the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 in a country? 2. What types of masks exist, and how elaborate
must a mask be to be effective against COVID-19? 3. Does the mask have to be
applied early in an epidemic? 4. A brief general discussion of masks and some
possible future research questions regarding masks and SARS-CoV-2. Results are
as follows: (1) The results indicate that any type of mask, even simple
home-made ones, may be effective. Masks use seems to have an effect in lowering
new patients even the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed ""one-mask
protection"") is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be
critical. However, increasing the one-mask protection to > 50% was found to be
advantageous. Masks seemed able to reduce overflow of capacity, e.g. of
intensive care. As the default parameters of the software included another
intervention, it seems possible to combine mask and other interventions. (2)
Masks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late
stage in an epidemic. However, early implementation helps reduce the cumulative
and total number of cases. (3) The simulations suggest that it might be
possible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a
limited period. The results from these simulations are encouraging, but do not
necessarily represent the real-life situation, so it is suggested that clinical
trials of masks are now carried out while continuously monitoring effects and
side-effects.

  quarantines","Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have implemented
non-pharmaceutical interventions like wearing masks, physical distancing,
lockdown, and travel restrictions. Because of their economic and logistical
effects, tracking mobility changes during quarantines is crucial in assessing
their efficacy and predicting the virus spread. Chile, one of the worst-hit
countries in the world, unlike many other countries, implemented quarantines at
a more localized level, shutting down small administrative zones, rather than
the whole country or large regions. Given the non-obvious effects of these
localized quarantines, tracking mobility becomes even more critical in Chile.
To assess the impact on human mobility of the localized quarantines in Chile,
we analyze a mobile phone dataset made available by Telef\'onica Chile, which
comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records and 5.4 million users covering the
period February 26th to September 20th, 2020. From these records, we derive
three epidemiologically relevant metrics describing the mobility within and
between comunas. The datasets made available can be used to fight the COVID-19
epidemics, particularly for localized quarantines' less understood effect.

first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second
wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy,
with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as

during hypothetical Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutical
intervention strategies. We consider local and non-local modes of disease
transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the
vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in
public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who
live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modeled as a
discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the
Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The~following assumptions are made. The
basic reproduction number is 2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately
ten days. Infections lead to SARS in about one percent of cases, which are
likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an
appropriate medical treatment. The~healthcare system capacity is simulated by
the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some
parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory
ventilators per 100000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for
the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare `do-nothing' strategy with
mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We
study epidemics in the pre-vaccine era, where immunity is obtained only by
infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare
and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that
slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not
significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but
increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a~hybrid strategy where
lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.

differences. The results have methodological limitations but show a tendency
for countries with a lower human development index score to tweet more about
cures, although they were a minor topic for all countries. Vaccines were
discussed about as much as treatments until July 2020, when they generated more
interest because of developments in Russia. The November 2020 Pfizer-BioNTech
preliminary Phase 3 trials results generated an immediate and sustained sharp
increase, however, followed by a continuing roughly linear increase in interest
for vaccines until at least April 2021. Against this background, national
deviations from the average were triggered by country-specific news about
cures, treatments or vaccines. Nevertheless, interest in vaccines in all
countries increased in parallel to some extent, despite substantial
international differences in national regulatory approval and availability. The
results also highlight that unsubstantiated claims about alternative medicine
remedies gained traction in several countries, apparently posing a threat to
public health.

This is an enormous opportunity for real-estate operators to innovate and

exposed just how vulnerable they are -- especially those living in close

requiring close physical contact with trained caregivers. Not only are trained
caregivers short in supply, but the pandemic has made it evident that
conventional high-touch approaches to senior care are high-cost and greater

built up a simple Bayesian model, in which the main quantity of interest plays
the role of {\em vaccine efficacy} (`$\epsilon$'). The resulting Bayesian
Network is processed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in JAGS
interfaced to R via rjags. As outcome, we get several probability density
functions (pdf's) of $\epsilon$, each conditioned on the data provided by the
three pharma companies. The result is rather stable against large variations of
the number of people participating in the trials and it is `somehow' in good
agreement with the results provided by the companies, in the sense that their
values correspond to the most probable value (`mode') of the pdf's resulting
from MCMC, thus reassuring us about the validity of our simple model. However
we maintain that the number to be reported as `vaccine efficacy' should be the
mean of the distribution, rather than the mode, as it was already very clear to
Laplace about 250 years ago (its `rule of succession' follows from the simplest
problem of the kind). This is particularly important in the case in which the
number of successes equals the numbers of trials, as it happens with the
efficacy against `severe forms' of infection, claimed by Moderna to be 100%.
The implication of the various uncertainties on the predicted number of
vaccinated infectees is also shown, using both MCMC and approximated formulae.

Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Networks (ED-CNNs), UNet, and Feature
Pyramid Network (FPN), with different backbone (encoder) structures using the
variants of DenseNet and ResNet. The conducted experiments showed the best
performance for lung region segmentation with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
of 97.19% and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 95.10% using U-Net model with

considering whether anti-transmission measures are worth social and economic
costs. The seriousness of economic costs such as the closure of some
workplaces, unemployment, reduction in production, and social costs such as
school closures, disruptions in education could be observable. However, the
effect of the measures taken on the spread of the epidemic, such as the number
of delayed or prevented cases, could not be observed. For this reason, the
direct effects of the measures taken on health, that is, the effects on the
course of the epidemic, are important research subjects. For this purpose, in
this study, the breakpoint linear regression analysis is performed to analyze
the trends of daily active cases, recovered, and deaths in Turkey. The analysis
reveals that there has been a remarkable impact on lockdown and other
precautions. Using the breakpoint regression model, we also analyze the active
cases' trajectory for eight affected countries and compare the patterns in
these countries with Turkey.

  COVID-19 Daily Cases in the US: A Google Trends Analysis","The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected virtually every region of the

United States is more than any other country, and the trend is increasing in
most of its states. Google trends provide public interest in various topics
during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods
might provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.
The objective of this study was to consider the predictive ability of different
search terms (i.e., bars and restaurants) with regards to the increase of daily
cases in the US. We considered the causation of two different search query
trends, namely restaurant and bars, on daily positive cases in top-10
states/territories of the United States with the highest and lowest daily new
positive cases. In addition, to measure the linear relation of different
trends, we used Pearson correlation. Our results showed for states/territories
with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries
related to bars and restaurants, which mainly happened after re-opening,
significantly affect the daily new cases, on average. California, for example,
had most searches for restaurants on June 7th, 2020, which affected the number
of new cases within two weeks after the peak with the P-value of .004 for
Granger's causality test. Although a limited number of search queries were
considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant
effect on daily new cases for regions with higher numbers of daily new cases in
the United States. We showed that such influential search trends could be used
as additional information for prediction tasks in new cases of each region.
This prediction can help healthcare leaders manage and control the impact of
COVID-19 outbreaks on society and be prepared for the outcomes.

maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known
clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed
technique is guaranteed to convergence through our proposed Cauchy proximal

line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed
detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is
performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line
identification method and show a considerable performance gain with 87%
correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In
addition, owing to its fast convergence, our proposed method is readily
applicable for processing LUS image sequences.

Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve
to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data
from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than
standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in

discovery of positive individuals with the need for population-based
surveillance aimed at understanding disease spread and characteristics. This
framework draws from similar approaches to prioritization in the domain of
cyber-security based on ranking individuals using a risk score and then
reserving a portion of the capacity for random sampling. This approach is an
application of Multi-Armed-Bandits maximizing exploration/exploitation of the
underlying distribution. We find that individuals can be ranked for effective
testing using a few simple features, and that ranking them using such models we
can capture 65% (CI: 64.7%-68.3%) of the positive individuals using less than
20% of the testing capacity or 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) of positives individuals
using 70% of the capacity, allowing reserving a significant portion of the

viral detection techniques to isolate infection breakouts. Current biochemical
detection techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), remain
inadequate for initial response due to the delay associated with sequencing the

virus such as mass and size can be quickly profiled and utilized for rapid
detection using mass spectrometry (MS). The recent developments in
Nanoelectromechanical Systems (NEMS) have made it possible to measure the mass
of single particulates with high accuracy; however, significant challenges
still exist in adapting NEMS-MS for real biological samples. Sample delivery to
the sensing element generally requires the use of delicate vacuum systems and
the sensing element suffers from low capture efficiency due to its miniscule
size. Here, we develop a NEMS-MS device with an integrated polymeric
electrostatic lens to enhance the capture efficiency by several
orders-of-magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art, while allowing for
operation under atmospheric conditions. After benchmarking and validating

recognition without receiving any examples beforehand is called Zero-Shot
Learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies
such as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement
of large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the
model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on
previously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary
information. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from
unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and
unforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We
introduce a novel and broaden solution called Few/one-shot learning, and
present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot
learning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot
Learning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our
recommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over
each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the
best techniques and practices based on their applications. We then review
through different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety
of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss
the recent applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful
intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning
tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications
in the current modern yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast
diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging the readers to develop other

use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs. This enables the
pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population. In
this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection
rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within
human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease
spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease
spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both
significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability
to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively
isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits:
targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into
the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating
super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less
effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of
topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a
population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important
complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a
sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.

such measures do not explain differences on a global scale, particularly when

Therefore, to control for country-level differences in response to COVID-19 we
consider the cross-cultural measure of individualism proposed by Hofstede. This
score can significantly explain variation in the size of epidemics across
Europe, North America, and East Asia. Using both our measure of

half the variation in the current size of epidemics across Europe and North

from early days to the saturation period in a given wave of this infectious
disease. It involves a set of effective parameters which can be extracted from
the available data. Using those parameters the future trajectories of the
disease spread can also be projected. A set of differential equations is also
proposed whose solutions are these time evolution trajectories. Using such a
formalism we project the future time evolution trajectories of infection spread
for a number of countries where the Covid-19 infection is still rapidly rising.

outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), online discourse on
Twitter reflects public opinion and perception related to the pandemic itself
as well as mitigating measures and their societal impact. Understanding such
discourse, its evolution, and interdependencies with real-world events or

are crucial facilitators for computational methods addressing tasks such as
sentiment analysis, event detection, or entity recognition. However, obtaining,
archiving, and semantically annotating large amounts of tweets is costly. In
this paper, we describe TweetsCOV19, a publicly available knowledge base of
currently more than 8 million tweets, spanning October 2019 - April 2020.
Metadata about the tweets as well as extracted entities, hashtags, user
mentions, sentiments, and URLs are exposed using established RDF/S

  a Post COVID World","The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments across the world to impose lockdowns
to prevent virus transmissions. This resulted in the shutdown of all economic
activity and accordingly the production at manufacturing plants across most
sectors was halted. While there is an urgency to resume production, there is an
even greater need to ensure the safety of the workforce at the plant site.
Reports indicate that maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks
while at work clearly reduces the risk of transmission. We decided to use
computer vision on CCTV feeds to monitor worker activity and detect violations
which trigger real time voice alerts on the shop floor. This paper describes an
efficient and economic approach of using AI to create a safe environment in a

described our face mask detection approach which provides a high accuracy

patients that develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. If true, this hypothesis may
have practical value in allocating resources to particular patients while using
a relatively inexpensive imaging technique. The difficulty of testing such a
hypothesis comes from the need for large sets of labelled data, which need to
be well-annotated and should contemplate the post-imaging severity outcome.
This paper presents an original methodology for extracting semantic features
that correlate to severity from a data set with patient ICU admission labels
through interpretable models. The methodology employs a neural network trained
to recognise lung pathologies to extract the semantic features, which are then
analysed with low-complexity models to limit overfitting while increasing
interpretability. This analysis points out that only a few features explain
most of the variance between patients that developed severe symptoms. When
applied to an unrelated larger data set with pathology-related clinical notes,
the method has shown to be capable of selecting images for the learned
features, which could translate some information about their common locations
in the lung. Besides attesting separability on patients that eventually develop
severe symptoms, the proposed methods represent a statistical approach
highlighting the importance of features related to ICU admission that may have
been only qualitatively reported. While handling limited data sets, notable
methodological aspects are adopted, such as presenting a state-of-the-art lung
segmentation network and the use of low-complexity models to avoid overfitting.
The code for methodology and experiments is also available.

  variable infection rate: Application to the Republic of Korea","This work constructs, analyzes, and simulates a new compartmental SEIR-type
model for the dynamics and potential control of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
The novelty in this work is two-fold. First, the population is divided
according to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown,
shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those
who fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or are
necessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on
the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of
the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their
relaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact
rate, which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns,
as it keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the
effectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential
inclusion. Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a
nonstandard convex analysis-based approach. As a case study, the pandemic
outbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model
parameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from
the reported data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The
simulations show that the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in
the subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and
its future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the
infections were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections
contribute silently but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating
that more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.

havoc across the world. The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive
drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective
tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named
as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an
announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective
from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever
undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study
aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a
kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was
further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in
order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true
state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection
distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii)
realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements
patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different
geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19
outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World
Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix)
incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a
long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but to
compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In
the framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant
success of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the

exponential growth, with the number of cases quite well fit in time by
$N(t)\propto e^{\alpha t}$, in many countries. We analyze the rate $\alpha$ for
each country, starting from a threshold of 30 total cases and using the next 12
days, capturing thus the early growth homogeneously. We look for a link between
$\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of each country, in the month of the
epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed
the epidemic earlier, an {\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\it
extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently.
Applying a linear fit $\alpha(T)$, we find increasing evidence for a decreasing
$\alpha$ as a function of $T$, at $99.66\%$C.L., $99.86\%$C.L. and $99.99995
\%$ C.L. ($p$-value $5 \cdot 10^{-7}$, or 5$\sigma$ detection) in the {\it

doubling time is expected to increase by $40\%\sim 50\%$, going from $5^\circ$
C to $25^\circ$ C. In the {\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a peak
at $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present, but its evidence disappears for
the larger datasets. We also analyzed a possible bias: poor countries, often
located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding
countries below a given GDP per capita, we find that our conclusions are only
slightly affected and only for the {\it extended} dataset. The significance
remains high, with a $p$-value of $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give
hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should
significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown
policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong
lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the cold season.

mechanisms, or remain completely unused, as in the Covid-19 pandemic, where
social distance constraints are enforced to limit the number of people who can
share public spaces. In this work, we plug this gap through market based
mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods.
To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein
each agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial currency budget that
they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets provide a strong
methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their
applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints -
budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. Thus, we introduce a
modified Fisher market, where each individual may have additional physical
constraints, characterize its solution properties and establish the existence
of a market equilibrium. Furthermore, to account for additional constraints we
introduce a social convex optimization problem where we perturb the budgets of
agents such that the KKT conditions of the perturbed social problem establishes
equilibrium prices. Finally, to compute the budget perturbations we present a
fixed point scheme and illustrate convergence guarantees through numerical
experiments. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally,
overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only
consider capacity and budget constraints.

the fight against covid-19 thus risks amplifying the pandemic's adverse effects
on vulnerable groups, exacerbating health inequity. In this paper, we claim
that AI systems can introduce or reflect bias and discrimination in three ways:
in patterns of health discrimination that become entrenched in datasets, in
data representativeness, and in human choices made during the design,
development, and deployment of these systems. We highlight how the use of AI
technologies threaten to exacerbate the disparate effect of covid-19 on
marginalised, under-represented, and vulnerable groups, particularly black,
Asian, and other minoritised ethnic people, older populations, and those of
lower socioeconomic status. We conclude that, to mitigate the compounding
effects of AI on inequalities associated with covid-19, decision makers,
technology developers, and health officials must account for the potential
biases and inequities at all stages of the AI process.

new estimator, the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM), that overcomes

twofold. From a methodological point of view, the ASCM outperforms the SCM in
that the latter cannot select a valid donor set, assigning all the weights to
only one country (Spain) while placing zero weights to all the remaining. From
an empirical point of view, we find strong evidence of the effectiveness of
non-pharmaceutical interventions in avoiding losses of human lives in Italy:
conservative estimates indicate that for each human life actually lost, in the

  population in China","Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of
the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental
ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

  while Suppressing the Receptor ACE2","The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to
identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2
virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one
of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2). Thus, spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and
antiviral drugs. A novel method has been recently described by some of the
authors to pharmacologically downregulate the expression of target proteins at
the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational
advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block
protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the
folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulations of the entire
sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealed
the existence of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden in
the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening
repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the
expression of ACE2. We identified four compounds capable of lowering ACE2
expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. All these molecules were
found to inhibit the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, the antiviral activity has been tested
against live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020 strain). One of the selected drugs
(Artefenomel) could completely prevent cytopathic effects induced by the
presence of the virus, thus showing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Ongoing studies are further evaluating the possibility of repurposing these
drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while
the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the
country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed
within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods
to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained
restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are
especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g., around
a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an
important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the
example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data

With the outbreak of the epidemic, many researchers are devoting themselves to
the COVID-19 screening system. The standard practices for rapid risk screening
of COVID-19 are the CT imaging or RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction).
However, these methods demand professional efforts of the acquisition of CT
images and saliva samples, a certain amount of waiting time, and most
importantly prohibitive examination fee in some countries. Recently, some
literatures have shown that the COVID-19 patients usually accompanied by ocular
manifestations consistent with the conjunctivitis, including conjunctival
hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. After more than four
months study, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the
consistent ocular pathological symbols; and we propose a new screening method
of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras,

reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if the
number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this
threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until
the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the
worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of
newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict
containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains
close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can
only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article,
using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment
strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of
susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that
minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The
existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is
fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead
theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an
infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary
measures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze the
minimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, and
show the relationship with the previous problem. Simulations are provided that
illustrate and validate the theoretical results.

radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on
CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable
chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of
Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully
automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and
evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep
learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was
developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection
of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest
x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and
Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data,
the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is,
100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the
model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the
accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this
indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set
of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open
source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%,
respectively.

for a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus emerged in late
December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is
highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and
causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding
to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the
analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society.
Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order
to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of
COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies.
Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to
judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this
paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use
various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential
growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time
dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model
fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the
reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2

subcontinent.

congestion will increases as the number of cars increase on the road, and
identify the most sensitive cites to drop in transit usage. Travel time and
mode share data from the American Community Survey of the US Census Bureau, for
metro areas across the US. A BPR model is used to relate average travel times
to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate
increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and car
pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and report the resulting travel
time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit
ridership are at risk for extreme traffic unless transit systems can resume
safe, high throughput operations quickly.

  Infectious Diseases such as COVID-19","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is unfolding as a major
international crisis whose influence extends to every aspect of our daily
lives. Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus
reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart
the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be
greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers
information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine
whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus
typically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing
individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via
a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing
their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such
strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is
especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days
after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many
COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy
strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare
up in the future.
  In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential
learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to
the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through
various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies
that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on
policy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance
bounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as
well as in the tests themselves.

develop and deploy smartphone apps to expedite contact tracing and risk
notification. Most of these apps track pairwise encounters between individuals
via Bluetooth and then use these tracked encounters to identify and notify
those who might have been in proximity of a contagious individual.
Unfortunately, these apps have not yet proven sufficiently effective, partly
owing to low adoption rates, but also due to the difficult tradeoff between
utility and privacy and the fact that, in COVID-19, most individuals do not
infect anyone but a few superspreaders infect many in superspreading events. In
this paper, we proposePanCast, a privacy-preserving and inclusive system for
epidemic risk assessment and notification that scales gracefully with adoption
rates, utilizes location and environmental information to increase utility
without tracking its users, and can be used to identify superspreading events.
To this end, rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones, our
system utilizes Bluetooth encounters between beacons placed in strategic
locations where superspreading events are most likely to occur and inexpensive,
zero-maintenance, small devices that users can attach to their keyring. PanCast
allows healthy individuals to use the system in a purely passive ""radio"" mode,
and can assist and benefit from other digital and manual contact tracing
systems. Finally, PanCast can be gracefully dismantled at the end of the
pandemic, minimizing abuse from any malevolent government or entity.

  lower than the classical herd immunity level","Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic
despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when
a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity
level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction
number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending
on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity
level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set
of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than
$h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured
community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also
categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and
high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates
proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\%$
rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is
required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when
immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups
with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates.
Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is
uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing
reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for
mask-wearing. What is the interplay between epidemic severity and the behaviors

help slow down the spread of diseases, like in the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective
social distancing, unless enforced as drastic lockdowns and mandatory cordon
sanitaire, requires consistent strict collective adherence. However, it remains
unknown what the determinants for the resultant compliance of social distancing
and their impact on disease mitigation are. Here, we incorporate into the
epidemiological process with an evolutionary game theory model that governs the
evolution of social distancing behavior. In our model, we assume an individual
acts in their best interest and their decisions are driven by adaptive social
learning of the real-time risk of infection in comparison with the cost of
social distancing. We find interesting oscillatory dynamics of social
distancing accompanied with waves of infection. Moreover, the oscillatory
dynamics are dampened with a nontrivial dependence on model parameters
governing decision-makings and gradually cease when the cumulative infections
exceed the herd immunity. Compared to the scenario without social distancing,
we quantify the degree to which social distancing mitigates the epidemic and
its dependence on individuals' responsiveness and rationality in their behavior

  with a Benchmark Dataset","Contact tracing has been globally adopted in the fight to control the
infection rate of COVID-19. Thanks to digital technologies, such as smartphones
and wearable devices, contacts of COVID-19 patients can be easily traced and
informed about their potential exposure to the virus. To this aim, several
interesting mobile applications have been developed. However, there are
ever-growing concerns over the working mechanism and performance of these
applications. The literature already provides some interesting exploratory
studies on the community's response to the applications by analyzing
information from different sources, such as news and users' reviews of the
applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing
solution that automatically analyzes users' reviews and extracts the evoked
sentiments. In this work, we propose a pipeline starting from manual annotation
via a crowd-sourcing study and concluding on the development and training of AI
models for automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews. In total, we employ
eight different methods achieving up to an average F1-Scores 94.8% indicating
the feasibility of automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews on the
COVID-19 contact tracing applications. We also highlight the key advantages,
drawbacks, and users' concerns over the applications. Moreover, we also collect
and annotate a large-scale dataset composed of 34,534 reviews manually
annotated from the contract tracing applications of 46 distinct countries. The
presented analysis and the dataset are expected to provide a baseline/benchmark
for future research in the domain.

COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In this chapter, we
summarize recent studies using large public Twitter data sets on these issues.
We have three primary objectives. First, we delineate epistemological and
practical considerations when combining the traditions of computational
research and social science research. A sensible balance should be struck when
the stakes are high between advancing social theory and concrete, timely
reporting of ongoing events. We additionally comment on the computational
challenges of gleaning insight from large amounts of social media data. Second,
we characterize the role of social bots in social media manipulation around the
discourse on the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Third,
we compare results from 2020 to prior years to note that, although bot accounts
still contribute to the emergence of echo-chambers, there is a transition from
state-sponsored campaigns to domestically emergent sources of distortion.
Furthermore, issues of public health can be confounded by political
orientation, especially from localized communities of actors who spread
misinformation. We conclude that automation and social media manipulation pose
issues to a healthy and democratic discourse, precisely because they distort
representation of pluralism within the public sphere.

working from home. The magnitude of this shift and the factors that have
accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software
engineering community has previously understood to be remote work. To find out
how developers and their productivity were affected, we distributed two surveys
(with 3,634 responses)---weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence
of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special
circumstance of remote work. From our thematic qualitative analysis and
statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of
developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a
benefit, while for others a challenge). For example, a benefit for some was
being close to family members but for others having family members share their
working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to
powerful narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these
experiences exist to provide insights as to how the future of (pandemic) remote

  Knowledge","Selecting causal inference models for estimating individualized treatment
effects (ITE) from observational data presents a unique challenge since the
counterfactual outcomes are never observed. The problem is challenged further
in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access
to labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that
achieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples
are available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the
predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between
the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the
model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with
identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by
existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in
the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains
to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods
under the UDA setting. In particular, we propose selecting models whose
predictions of interventions' effects satisfy known causal structures in the
target domain. Experimentally, our method selects ITE models that are more
robust to covariate shifts on several healthcare datasets, including estimating
the effect of ventilation in COVID-19 patients from different geographic
locations.

SARS-CoV-2 infection from early February 2021. The objectives of this study
were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the
factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh.
  Method: In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based
anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. The
multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that
influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination.
  Results: 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the
COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness
to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the
vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine's efficacy and safety or
COVID-19 become deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age,
gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of
being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection,
having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge
about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the
acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.
  Conclusion: The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine
refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and
increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched
immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine
acceptance among people, false rumors and misconceptions about the COVID-19
vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be
exposed to the actual scientific facts.

for automatic disease diagnosis. However, a threat to these systems arises that
adversarial attacks make CNNs vulnerable. Inaccurate diagnosis results make a
negative influence on human healthcare. There is a need to investigate
potential adversarial attacks to robustify deep medical diagnosis systems. On
the other side, there are several modalities of medical images (e.g., CT,
fundus, and endoscopic image) of which each type is significantly different
from others. It is more challenging to generate adversarial perturbations for
different types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based
medical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial
perturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists
of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term
increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example
and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures
similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the
perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed
loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth
the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence
of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes
the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from
the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack
effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations
in small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks
including the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed
method.

response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to
reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of
schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social
distancing, including local and national lockdowns. We use a Monte-Carlo (MC)
based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population
densities using the most recent epidemic data in our work. We test the spread
of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various
combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each
model and constraint. In this paper, we have tested three different time-cyclic
patterns of no-restrictions/lockdown patterns. This model's main prediction is
that a cyclic schedule of no-restrictions/lockdown that contains at least ten
days of lockdown for each time cycle can help control the virus infection. In
particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social
distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.

humongous fear and dependence on social media like never before. Fear
inevitably leads to panic, speculations, and the spread of misinformation. Many
governments have taken measures to curb the spread of such misinformation for
public well being. Besides global measures, to have effective outreach, systems
for demographically local languages have an important role to play in this
effort. Towards this, we propose an approach to detect fake news about COVID-19
early on from social media, such as tweets, for multiple Indic-Languages
besides English. In addition, we also create an annotated dataset of Hindi and
Bengali tweet for fake news detection. We propose a BERT based model augmented
with additional relevant features extracted from Twitter to identify fake
tweets. To expand our approach to multiple Indic languages, we resort to mBERT
based model which is fine-tuned over created dataset in Hindi and Bengali. We
also propose a zero-shot learning approach to alleviate the data scarcity issue
for such low resource languages. Through rigorous experiments, we show that our
approach reaches around 89% F-Score in fake tweet detection which supercedes
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark
for two Indic-Languages, Hindi and Bengali. Using our annotated data, our model
achieves about 79% F-Score in Hindi and 81% F-Score for Bengali Tweets. Our
zero-shot model achieves about 81% F-Score in Hindi and 78% F-Score for Bengali
Tweets without any annotated data, which clearly indicates the efficacy of our
approach.

  $R$ formula","Many governments have managed to control their COVID-19 outbreak with a
simple message: keep the effective '$R$ number' $R<1$ to prevent widespread
contagion and flatten the curve. This raises the question whether a similar
policy could control dangerous online 'infodemics' of information,
misinformation and disinformation. Here we show, using multi-platform data from
the COVID-19 infodemic, that its online spreading instead encompasses a
different dynamical regime where communities and users within and across
independent platforms, sporadically form temporary active links on similar
timescales to the viral spreading. This allows material that might have died
out, to evolve and even mutate. This has enabled niche networks that were
already successfully spreading hate and anti-vaccination material, to rapidly
become global super-spreaders of narratives featuring fake COVID-19 treatments,
anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories. We derive new tools that
incorporate these coupled social-viral dynamics, including an online $R$, to
help prevent infodemic spreading at all scales: from spreading across platforms
(e.g. Facebook, 4Chan) to spreading within a given subpopulation, or community,
or topic. By accounting for similar social and viral timescales, the same
mathematical theory also offers a quantitative description of other
unconventional infection profiles such as rumors spreading in financial markets
and colds spreading in schools.

prohibitively priced on the market to allow for nationwide deployment. In this
paper, we present an accessible, mobile, affordable, and safe version of a
positive-pressure COVID-19 testing booth. The booths are manufactured using
primarily off-the-shelf components from US vendors with minimized
customization. The booths' mobility allows them to be easily transported within
local communities to test a larger subset of the population with fewer
transportation options. Moreover, the final bill of materials does not surpass
USD 3,900, which is about half of the market price. The booths are air
conditioned and HEPA filtered to offer healthcare providers a safe and

exchange tests, and was positively reviewed by two healthcare professionals.
Currently, five booths are deployed and used at the Johns Hopkins University

centers in Baltimore. Our design facilitates walk-up testing in the US, as it
decreases PPE consumption; reduces the risk of infection; and is accessible to

  Multi-symptom Classification","Ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive yet effective medical diagnostic imaging
technique for the COVID-19 global pandemic. However, due to complex feature
behaviors and expensive annotations of US images, it is difficult to apply
Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisting approaches for lung's multi-symptom
(multi-label) classification. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a
novel semi-supervised Two-Stream Active Learning (TSAL) method to model
complicated features and reduce labeling costs in an iterative procedure. The
core component of TSAL is the multi-label learning mechanism, in which label
correlations information is used to design multi-label margin (MLM) strategy
and confidence validation for automatically selecting informative samples and
confident labels. On this basis, a multi-symptom multi-label (MSML)
classification network is proposed to learn discriminative features of lung
symptoms, and a human-machine interaction is exploited to confirm the final
annotations that are used to fine-tune MSML with progressively labeled data.
Moreover, a novel lung US dataset named COVID19-LUSMS is built, currently
containing 71 clinical patients with 6,836 images sampled from 678 videos.
Experimental evaluations show that TSAL using only 20% data can achieve
superior performance to the baseline and the state-of-the-art. Qualitatively,
visualization of both attention map and sample distribution confirms the good
consistency with the clinic knowledge.

to a remote learning that has several drawbacks and has been hurriedly
arranged; in addition, most countries are currently uncertain on how to plan
school activities for the 2020-2021 school year; all of this makes learning and
education some of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic.
Unfortunately, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full
opening of schools seems to be impractical till a vaccine is available. In
order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study a
mathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, and
evaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to school
activities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods. We
consider a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss
function; after a realistic parameter selection, we numerically determine
optimal school opening strategies by simulated annealing. It turns out that
blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote
teaching days or weeks, are generally optimal. Besides containing Covid-19
diffusion, these solutions could be pedagogically acceptable, and could also
become a driving model for the society at large. In a prototypical example, the
optimal strategy results in the school opening 90 days out of 200 with the
number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing
by about 66%, instead of the about 250% increase that would have been a

been misleading. Here, we dissect the predictions made by four models for the
daily COVID-19 death counts between March 25 and June 5 in New York state, as
well as the predictions of ICU bed utilisation made by the influential IHME
model. We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the
uncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the ""ground
truth"" data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained.
Three different data sources were used by these models, and these had
substantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data
sources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For
accuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly. Only 10.2% of the
predictions fell within 10% of their training ground truth, irrespective of
distance into the future. For accurate assessment of uncertainty, only one
model matched relatively well the nominal 95% coverage, but that model did not
start predictions until April 16, thus had no impact on early, major decisions.
For ICU bed utilisation, the IHME model was highly inaccurate; the point
estimates only started to match ground truth after the pandemic wave had
started to wane. We conclude that trustworthy models require trustworthy input
data to be trained upon. Moreover, models need to be subjected to prespecified
real time performance tests, before their results are provided to policy makers
and public health officials.

Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more
privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without
concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit
corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations
of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty
into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk
can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant
information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform
epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor.
These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors
involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate
and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical
and economic productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile

  machine learning and virtual screening","Global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by newly identified
SARS- CoV-2 coronavirus continues to claim the lives of thousands of people
worldwide. The unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led
to drug repositioning efforts using various approaches, including computational
analyses. Such analyses mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D
structure of the target protein to be available. In this study, we utilized a
set of machine learning algorithms and trained them on a dataset of
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run inference analyses on
antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand information.
We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates predicted
by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARS-
CoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the
ligand information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to
identify candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with
documented activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other
identified drug candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the
hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir
and faldaprevir. Further analysis of these candidates using molecular docking
against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed low binding energies against the enzyme
active site. Our approach also identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol,
lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid to have potential
activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the results of this study are
considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options against
COVID-19.

findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific
and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with
desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines.
These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction
engines -- scientists and inventor -- who continuously alter the landscape of
discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to substitute
for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective
advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise
into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to
experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and
inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable
energy-relevant materials increases the precision of materials predictions by
~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new diseases increases
precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical
trials by 260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the
scientists who will make them. By tuning AI to avoid the crowd, however, it
generates scientifically promising ""alien"" hypotheses unlikely to be imagined
or pursued without intervention, not only accelerating but punctuating
scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias,
these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by
reformulating science education for discovery.

proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in
this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the
evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is
relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or
Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on
aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is
accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real
interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active
monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing
or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the
short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations,
and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus
measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify
and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it
offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be
falsified.

scientific point of view the first major task is to predict the dynamics of the

fight it, as well as gauging the success of these measures by comparison with
the predictions in hindsight. The vast majority of pandemic models are based on
extensive models with large numbers of fit parameters, leading to individual
descriptions for every hot spot on the world. This makes predictions and
comparisons cumbersome, if not impossible. We here propose a different
approach, by moving away from a description over time, and instead choosing the
total number of infected people in an enclosed area as the independent
variable. Analyzing a few hot spots data, we derive an empirical formula for
the dynamics, dependent only on three variables. The final number of infections
is strictly connected to one fit parameter we call mitigation factor, which in
turn is mostly dependent only on the enclosed population. Despite its
simpleness, this description applies to every of the around 50 countries we
have analyzed, allows to separate different waves of the pandemic, provides a
figure of merit for the overall usefulness of government measures, and shows
when a pandemic is ending. Our model is robust against undetected cases, and
allows all nations, in particular those with fewer resources, to reasonably
predict the outcome of the pandemic in their country.

Transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers rendered
intervention and containment of the disease extremely challenging. Based on

against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the
initial outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical
interventions. Mathematical treatment of the model yields explicit expressions
for the size of latent and pre-symptomatic subpopulations during the
exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic growth rate as input. We then
explore reduction of the basic reproduction number R_0 through specific disease
control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing
masks and sheltering in place. When these measures are implemented in
combination, their effects on R_0 multiply. We also compare our model behaviour
to the first wave of the COVID-19 spreading in various affected regions and
highlight generic and less generic features of the pandemic development.

can perfectly capture quantum randomness phenomena in a better way. Further we
demonstrate an equivalent formalism of computation using a general time
independent Hamiltonian having well defined eigenstate representation for

within the framework of supersymmetry. For the Harmonic Oscillator case we
obtain similar periodic time dependence but dissimilar parameter dependences
compared to the results obtained from both micro-canonical and canonical
ensembles in quantum mechanics without supersymmetry. On the other hand, for

scale and the other parameter dependence compared to the results obtained from

difficulties for individuals trying to be tested, especially in low-resource

This discrepancy may add a bias that affects COVID-19 status predictions. To
tackle this issue, we propose a multi-branch deep learning network that is

in suggesting optimal policies at both individual and area levels. In this
paper, we propose a multi-region SEIR model based on stochastic differential
game theory, aiming to formulate optimal regional policies for infectious
diseases. Specifically, we enhance the standard epidemic SEIR model by taking
into account the social and health policies issued by multiple region planners.
This enhancement makes the model more realistic and powerful. However, it also
introduces a formidable computational challenge due to the high dimensionality
of the solution space brought by the presence of multiple regions. This
significant numerical difficulty of the model structure motivates us to
generalize the deep fictitious algorithm introduced in [Han and Hu, MSML2020,
pp.221--245, PMLR, 2020] and develop an improved algorithm to overcome the
curse of dimensionality. We apply the proposed model and algorithm to study the
COVID-19 pandemic in three states: New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The
model parameters are estimated from real data posted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). We are able to show the effects of the
lockdown/travel ban policy on the spread of COVID-19 for each state and how
their policies affect each other.

enough oxygen to adequately supply the tissues, is a leading indicator for
dangerous complications of respiratory diseases like asthma, COPD, and
COVID-19. While purpose-built pulse oximeters can provide accurate blood-oxygen
saturation (SpO$_2$) readings that allow for diagnosis of hypoxemia, enabling
this capability in unmodified smartphone cameras via a software update could
give more people access to important information about their health, as well as
improve physicians' ability to remotely diagnose and treat respiratory
conditions. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by performing the
first clinical development validation on a smartphone-based SpO$_2$ sensing
system using a varied fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO$_2$) protocol, creating
a clinically relevant validation dataset for solely smartphone-based methods on
a wide range of SpO$_2$ values (70%-100%) for the first time. This contrasts
with previous studies, which evaluated performance on a far smaller range
(85%-100%). We build a deep learning model using this data to demonstrate
accurate reporting of SpO$_2$ level with an overall MAE=5.00% SpO$_2$ and
identifying positive cases of low SpO$_2$<90% with 81% sensitivity and 79%
specificity. We ground our analysis with a summary of recent literature in
smartphone-based SpO2 monitoring, and we provide the data from the FiO$_2$

  Wuhan before Lockdown","Background: Wuhan, China was the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of
current study is to understand the infection transmission dynamics before
intervention measures were taken. Methods: Data and key events were searched
through pubmed and internet. Epidemiological data were calculated using data
extracted from a variety of data sources. Results: We established a timeline
showing by January 1, 2020, Chinese authorities had been presented convincing
evidence of human-to-human transmission; however, it was not until January 20,
2020 that this information was shared with the public. Our study estimated that
there would have been 10989 total infected cases if interventions were taken on
January 2, 2020, versus 239875 cases when lockdown was put in place on January
23, 2020. Conclusions: China's withholding of key information about the 2020
COVID-19 outbreak and its delayed response ultimately led to the largest public
health crisis of this century and could have been avoided with earlier
countermeasures.

which it is possible to define a mapping from the distribution that generated
the existing external data to the relative efficiency of a covariate-adjusted

efficiencies approximate the ratio of sample size needed to achieve a desired
power. We consider two situations where the outcome is either fully or
partially observed and several treatment effect estimands that are of
particular interest in most trials. For each such estimand, we develop a
semiparametrically efficient estimator of the relative efficiency that allows
for the application of flexible statistical learning tools to estimate the
nuisance functions and an analytic form of a corresponding Wald-type confidence
interval. We also propose a double bootstrap scheme for constructing confidence
intervals. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through
simulation studies and apply these methods to data to estimate the relative

over the world. As one of the efficient solutions, mechanical
harvest/auto-harvest that is based on object detection and robotic harvester
becomes an urgent need. Within the auto-harvest system, robust few-shot object
detection model is one of the bottlenecks, since the system is required to deal
with new vegetable/fruit categories and the collection of large-scale annotated
datasets for all the novel categories is expensive. There are many few-shot
object detection models that were developed by the community. Yet whether they
could be employed directly for real life agricultural applications is still
questionable, as there is a context-gap between the commonly used training
datasets and the images collected in real life agricultural scenarios. To this
end, in this study, we present a novel cucumber dataset and propose two data
augmentation strategies that help to bridge the context-gap. Experimental
results show that 1) the state-of-the-art few-shot object detection model
performs poorly on the novel `cucumber' category; and 2) the proposed

  Tests","One of the main challenges in containing the Coronoavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic stems from the difficulty in carrying out efficient mass
diagnosis over large populations. The leading method to test for COVID-19
infection utilizes qualitative polymerase chain reaction, implemented using
dedicated machinery which can simultaneously process a limited amount of
samples. A candidate method to increase the test throughput is to examine
pooled samples comprised of a mixture of samples from different patients. In
this work we study pooling-based COVID-19 tests. We identify the specific
requirements of COVID-19 testing, including the need to characterize the
infection level and to operate in a one-shot fashion, which limit the
application of traditional group-testing (GT) methods. We then propose a
multi-level GT scheme, designed specifically to meet the unique requirements of
COVID-19 tests, while exploiting the strength of GT theory to enable accurate
recovery using much fewer tests than patients. Our numerical results
demonstrate that multi-level GT reliably and efficiently detects the infection
levels, while achieving improved accuracy over previously proposed one-shot

the high transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2, remind us of the sad reality that
our current understanding of the transmission, infectivity, and evolution of

mechanistic understanding of viral-host cell interactions, the viral
regulation, protein-protein interactions, including antibody-antigen binding,
protein-drug binding, host immune response, etc. This limitation will likely
haunt the scientific community for a long time and have a devastating

  monitored carbon dioxide","The risk of long range, herein `airborne', infection needs to be better
understood and is especially urgent during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We
present a method to determine the relative risk of airborne transmission that
can be readily deployed with either modelled or monitored CO$_2$ data and
occupancy levels within an indoor space. For spaces regularly, or consistently,
occupied by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school
classroom, we establish protocols to assess the absolute risk of airborne
infection of this regular attendance at work or school. We present a
methodology to easily calculate the expected number of secondary infections
arising from a regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining
pre/asymptomatic within these spaces. We demonstrate our model by calculating
risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored data recorded
within a small naturally ventilated office. In addition, by inferring
ventilation rates from monitored CO$_2$ we show that estimates of airborne
infection can be accurately reconstructed; thereby offering scope for more
informed retrospective modelling should outbreaks occur in spaces where CO$_2$
is monitored. Our modelling suggests that regular attendance at an office for
work is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic but only if
relatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate
ventilation (i.e. at least 10\,l/s/p following UK guidance), appropriate
hygiene controls, distancing measures, and that all commuting presents minimal
infection risk. Crucially, modelling even moderate changes to the conditions
within the office, or basing estimates for the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2
variant B1.1.7 current data, typically results in the prediction that for a
single infector within the office the airborne route alone gives rises to more
than one secondary infection.

aggregation results by proposing predicates that describe input records that,
if deleted, would resolve the anomalies. However, it can be difficult for users
to understand how a predicate was chosen, and these approaches are limited to
errors that can be resolved through deletion. In contrast, data errors may be
due to group-wise errors, such as missing records or systematic value errors.
This paper presents Reptile, an explanation system for hierarchical data. Given
an anomalous aggregate query result, Reptile recommends the next drill-down
attribute,and ranks the drill-down groups based on the extent repairing the
group's statistics to its expected values resolves the anomaly. Reptile
efficiently trains a multi-level model that leverages the data's hierarchy to
estimate the expected values, and uses a factorised representation of the
feature matrix to remove redundancies due to the data's hierarchical structure.
We further extend model training to support factorised data, and develop a
suite of optimizations that leverage the data's hierarchical structure. Reptile

between muscular contraction in the thorax, elasto-capillary interactions in
individual lung branches, propagation of air between different connected
branches, and overall air flow into the lungs. These processes occur over
considerably different length and time scales; consequently, linking them to
the biomechanical properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together
control the spatiotemporal features of inhalation, remains a challenge. We
address this challenge by developing a computational model of the lungs as a
hierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders
coupled to a viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a
pressure that is determined by input biomechanical parameters, enabling us to
test the influence of changes in the mechanical properties of lung tissues and
secretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches,
we quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during
inhalation, reproducing the shape of measured breathing curves. Using this
model, we demonstrate how changes in lung muscle contraction, mucus viscosity
and surface tension, and airway wall stiffness---characteristic of many
respiratory diseases, including those arising from COVID-19, cystic fibrosis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and emphysema---drastically
alter inhaled lung capacity and breathing duration. Our work therefore helps to
identify the key factors that control breathing dynamics, and provides a way to
quantify how disease-induced changes in these factors lead to respiratory
distress.

  Time-dependent SIR Model","The current outbreak is known as Coronavirus Disease or COVID-19 caused by
the virus SAR-COV-2 which continues to wreak havoc across the globe. The World
Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the rise
with the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In the
absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections
and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding
preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy about
the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the
COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we
conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and
accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide
future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as
the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We
have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from
late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range
20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of
57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the
lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the
epidemic is not curtailed and localized. The uncertainty on single day
projection in our analysis after April 15 is found to be within 5\%.

  chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks","Under the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest
X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,
we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the
robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.

accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of
representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a
few countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data
are available. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries,
three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken
countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show
that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach. At
the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking

worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out
jointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative
case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only demands
collecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the
tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with
population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population
controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that
test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population
controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic
persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory
infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal
magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be
identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to
compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional
case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups:
one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn
from existing country-wide health care databases. We also describe other
possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population
controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures
that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and
exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be
applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of non-epidemic disease.

and practicing physical distancing to mitigate the virus's spread. This paper
developed a computer vision system to automatically detect the violation of
face mask wearing and physical distancing among construction workers to assure
their safety on infrastructure projects during the pandemic. For the face mask
detection, the paper collected and annotated 1,000 images, including different
types of face mask wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask dataset
to develop a dataset of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple
Tensorflow state-of-the-art object detection models on the face mask dataset
and chose the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 network that yielded the
accuracy of 99.8%. For physical distance detection, the paper employed the
Faster R-CNN Inception V2 to detect people. A transformation matrix was used to
eliminate the camera angle's effect on the object distances on the image. The
Euclidian distance used the pixels of the transformed image to compute the
actual distance between people. A threshold of six feet was considered to
capture physical distance violation. The paper also used transfer learning for
training the model. The final model was applied on four videos of road
maintenance projects in Houston, TX, that effectively detected the face mask

telecommunication for remote learning/working and telemedicine has
significantly increased. In this context, preserving high Quality of Service
(QoS) and maintaining low latency communication are of paramount importance.
Development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-aided heterogeneous cellular
network is a promising solution to satisfy the aforementioned requirements.
There are, however, key challenges ahead, on the one hand, it is challenging to
optimally increase content diversity in caching nodes to mitigate the network's
traffic over the backhaul. On the other hand is the challenge of attenuated
UAVs' signal in indoor environments, which increases users' access delay and
UAVs' energy consumption. To address these challenges, we incorporate UAVs, as
mobile caching nodes, together with Femto Access points (FAPs) to increase the
network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments. Referred to as the
Cluster-centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, a two-phase

reduction in the users' access delay, and significant reduction in UAVs' energy
consumption. To mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas, the
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) approach is integrated within the CCUF
framework. In contrary to existing works, we analytically compute the optimal
number of FAPs in each cluster to increase the cache-hit probability of coded
content placement. Furthermore, the optimal number of coded contents to be
stored in each caching node is computed to increase the cache-hit-ratio,
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and
decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content

with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the
infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may
ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the
epidemic started on February 25. We calibrate the model with the number of dead
individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of
values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31)
approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3
initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of
lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7
million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period
providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection
period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the
reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is
0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed.
However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If
approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times
more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax
these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the
incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period
(13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times
more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination
of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the
epidemic.

but higher overall. This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference in case
demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we
introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used
to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a
coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and mortality. As a case
study, we then investigate total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal

allows us to separate age-related effects from others unrelated to age, and
thus facilitates a more transparent comparison of CFRs across countries
throughout the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.

First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the
early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an
algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the
onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a
hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity
optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed
solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the
problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize
the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize
this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose
an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we
derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model
with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for
non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed
framework in numerical experiments involving a model of Covid-19 applied to a

analyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell,
8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm
for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein
cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes
involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2,
BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst
including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are
co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the
trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for
proteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We
identified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are
enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are
common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid
metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
Together our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive
to coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they
also express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and
replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient
management for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.

emergency of international concern. During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,
people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the risk of exposure to the
coronavirus. Experimental data, however, show that infected aerosols and
droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We
propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is
proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our
puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm
air} < 4.0$, where $\rho_P$ and $\rho_{\rm air}$ are the average density of the
puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold
or warmth. We also demonstrate that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended
for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its
coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.

the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung
infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to
augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However,
segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including
high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between
infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is
impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep
model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection
Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify
infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial

Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized
to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate
the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation
framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only
requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our
semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically

environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of
contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in
on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to

Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new
routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has
created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively
monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of
remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the

ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic

suffering from it. These are based on the number of excess deaths attributed
either directly or indirectly to the epidemic. Unfortunately the data on which
such comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This article
discusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely
accurate and delayed by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office
of National Statistics in the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and
the Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article is taken from
these three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of
deaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to
country. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years,
in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11
years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on
the timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics
and heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline
defined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors
can be operationalized by taking say the 10\% quantile of the number of deaths.
This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It
therefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries.
The article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between
countries. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics by their timing,
that is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the
height of the maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered.

trade-off arising from public health and economic cost. An optimal lockdown
policy to resolve this trade-off is highly desired. Here we propose a

lockdown, where our goal is to reduce the economic activity as little as
possible while decreasing the number of infected individuals at a prescribed
rate. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal lockdown
policy for general epidemic spread models, including both the classical
SIS/SIR/SEIR models and a new model of COVID-19 transmissions. We demonstrate
the power of this framework by analyzing publicly available data of
inter-county travel frequencies to analyze a model of COVID-19 spread in the 62
counties of New York State. We find that an optimal lockdown based on epidemic
status in April 2020 would have reduced economic activity more stringently
outside of New York City compared to within it, even though the epidemic was
much more prevalent in New York City at that point. Such a counterintuitive
result highlights the intricacies of pandemic control and sheds light on future
lockdown policy design.

but their collection relies on conventional representative survey techniques,
which are expensive and slow to obtain. Here we report a data collection effort
involving over $2.3\%$ of the Hungarian population to simultaneously record
contact matrices through a longitudinal online and sequence of representative
phone surveys. To correct non-representative biases characterising the online
data, by using census data and the representative samples we develop a
reconstruction method to provide a scalable, cheap, and flexible way to
dynamically obtain closer-to-representative contact matrices. Our results
demonstrate the potential of combined online-offline data collections to
understand the changing behavioural responses determining the future evolution
of the outbreak, and inform epidemic models with crucial data.

network that learns solutions of differential equations for different modeling
parameters and initial conditions. A supervised method then solves the inverse
problem by estimating the optimal conditions that generate functions to fit the
data for those infected by, recovered from, and deceased due to COVID-19. This
semi-supervised approach incorporates real data to determine the evolution of

described different changes in routine blood parameters. However, these
changes, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a
machine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based
and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various
bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected
operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The
cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful
routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature
importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count,
albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed
that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more
like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic
accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest
CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now
have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients
with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies
to confirm the diagnosis. We believe that our results present a significant
contribution to improvements in COVID-19 diagnosis.

  Classification","The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lead to a global
public health crisis spreading hundreds of countries. With the continuous
growth of new infections, developing automated tools for COVID-19
identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis
and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the
datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to
aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and
generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to
perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with
heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful
backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network
architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and
learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly
tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization
in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective
to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the
classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method
with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images.
Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently improves the
performances on both datasets, outperforming the original COVID-Net trained on
each dataset by 12.16% and 14.23% in AUC respectively, also exceeding existing
state-of-the-art multi-site learning methods.

  COVID-19 in X-Ray Images","Background and Purpose: Coronaviruses (CoV) are perilous viruses that may
cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was
discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end
of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of
infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the
updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net
to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study
is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19
cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep
convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural
network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image
to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.
Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,
respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models
showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with
f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to
classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework.
Clinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.

  Methods: We fine-tuned neural networks pretrained on ImageNet and applied a

intermediate step. We also suggested a novelty called output neuron keeping,
which changes the twice transfer learning technique. In order to clarify the
modus operandi of the models, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
generate heatmaps.
  Results: We were able to reach test accuracy of 100% on our test dataset.
Twice transfer learning and output neuron keeping showed promising results
improving performances, mainly in the beginning of the training process.
Although LRP revealed that words on the X-rays can influence the networks'
predictions, we discovered this had only a very small effect on accuracy.
  Conclusion: Although clinical studies and larger datasets are still needed to
further ensure good generalization, the state-of-the-art performances we
achieved show that, with the help of artificial intelligence, chest X-rays can
become a cheap and accurate auxiliary method for COVID-19 diagnosis. Heatmaps
generated by LRP improve the interpretability of the deep neural networks and
indicate an analytical path for future research on diagnosis. Twice transfer
learning with output neuron keeping improved performances.

generalizability. Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the
efficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19

evaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional
dataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing
patients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large
false positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR
(23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54

significantly lower across all the datasets as compared to COVID-Net -
EMORY(9.1%), ChexPert (1.3%), ChestX-ray14 (0.02%), MIMIC-CXR (0.06%).
Conclusion: The models reported good to excellent performance on their internal
datasets, however we observed from our testing that their performance
dramatically worsened on external data. This is likely from several causes
including overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and
ground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR,
which could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa.
Therefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have
better performance and generalization.

  from a natural experiment in Sweden","The Bacille Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity
benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized
that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found
that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhood
vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,
this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took
place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led
to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us
to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with
cross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were
recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change,
representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used
regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19
related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high
precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled
trial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations
were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]),
respectively. We can thus reject with 95\% confidence that universal BCG
vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of
hospitalizations by more than 24%. While the effect of a recent vaccination
must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at
birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.

  in Wuhan, China","In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24
January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a
city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass
quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its
scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using
a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show
that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down
the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) > 1 to
R(t) <1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in
Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected
case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health
policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down
the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in
other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail
spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in
the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March
2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction
number at R(t) <1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures
in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent
increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) >1. Thus, it may be wise
to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which

  Interventions: A Geometric Programming Approach","In this paper we propose a data-driven model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and
use it to design optimal control strategies of human-mobility restrictions that
both curb the epidemic and minimize the economic costs associated with
implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. We develop an extension of the
SEIR epidemic model that captures the effects of changes in human mobility on
the spread of the disease. The parameters of our data-driven model are learned
using a multitask learning approach that leverages both data on the number of
deaths across a set of regions, and cellphone data on individuals' mobility
patterns specific to each region. We propose an optimal control problem on this
data-driven model with a tractable solution provided by geometric programming.
The result of this framework is a mobility-based intervention strategy that
curbs the spread of the epidemic while obeying a budget on the economic cost
incurred. Furthermore, in the absence of a straightforward mapping from human
mobility data to economic costs, we propose a practical method by which a
budget on economic losses incurred may be chosen to eliminate excess deaths due
to over-utilization of hospital resources. Our results are demonstrated with
numerical simulations using real data from the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

  Superspreading","A primary quantity of interest in the study of infectious diseases is the
average number of new infections that an infected person produces. This
so-called reproduction number has significant implications for the disease
progression. There has been increasing literature suggesting that
superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused

paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of
the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly,
we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to
estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of
COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of
the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves
the performance of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the
derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading
to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as
a valuable heuristic for understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases

  Based on Geolocation Data from Mobile Cellular Networks","The coronavirus (COVID-19) has appeared as the greatest challenge due to its
continuous structural evolution as well as the absence of proper antidotes for
this particular virus. The virus mainly spreads and replicates itself among
mass people through close contact which unfortunately can happen in many
unpredictable ways. Therefore, to slow down the spread of this novel virus, the
only relevant initiatives are to maintain social distance, perform contact
tracing, use proper safety gears, and impose quarantine measures. But despite
being theoretically possible, these approaches are very difficult to uphold in
densely populated countries and areas. Therefore, to control the virus spread,
researchers and authorities are considering the use of smartphone based mobile
applications (apps) to identify the likely infected persons as well as the
highly risky zones to maintain isolation and lockdown measures. However, these
methods heavily depend on advanced technological features and expose
significant privacy loopholes. In this paper, we propose a new method for
COVID-19 contact tracing based on mobile phone users' geolocation data. The
proposed method will help the authorities to identify the number of probable
infected persons without using smartphone based mobile applications. In
addition, the proposed method can help people take the vital decision of when
to seek medical assistance by letting them know whether they are already in the
list of exposed persons. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed
method can significantly outperform the smartphone app-based solutions.

  Restrictions for Epidemic Control","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across more than 180
countries and territories since late January 2020. As a worldwide emergency
response, governments have taken various measures and implemented policies,
such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional
lockdown, to control the rapid spread of this epidemic. The common intention of
these countermeasures is to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a
highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission.
Medical experts and policy makers have expressed the urgency of being able to
effectively evaluate the effects of human restriction policies with the aid of
big data and information technology. Thus, in this study, based on big human
mobility data and city POI data, we designed an interactive visual analytics
system named EpiMob (Epidemic Mobility). The system interactively simulates the
changes in human mobility and the number of infected people in response to the
implementation of a certain restriction policy or combination of policies
(e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently
designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction
policies, and the result reflecting the infection situation under different
policies is dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared. We completed
multiple case studies of the largest metropolitan area in Japan (i.e., Greater
Tokyo Area) and conducted interviews with domain experts to demonstrate that
our system can provide illustrative insight by measuring and comparing the
effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control.

multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief
utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify a
constraint to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for
each resource. Such constraints often arise from location constraints (e.g.
among all of the volunteer nurses, only those who live nearby can work at
hospital A due to commute constraints. So hospital A can only receive
allocations of volunteers from a subset of the total supply). This can also
model a type of substitute effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A
\emph{or} B, but some other agents specifically want A, and some specifically
want B. We propose a new mechanism called Group Dominant Resource Fairness
which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs.
The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness,
strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first mechanism to achieve all four
properties in our setting. Furthermore, we show numerically that our method
scales better to large problems than alternative approaches. Finally, although
motivated by the problem of medical resource allocation in a pandemic, our
mechanism can be applied more broadly to resource allocation under Leontief
utilities with accessibility constraints.

differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify
potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a
systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

challenging to understand, especially as these and other parameters are

different mathematical approaches that should be understood and accounted for
when relying on parameter values and reporting them to the public. Here, we
offer several insights regarding the derivation of commonly-reported
epidemiological parameters, and describe how mitigation measures like lockdown
are expected to affect their values. We aim to present these quantitative
relationships in a manner that is accessible to the widest audience possible.
We hope that better communicating the intricacies of epidemiological models

different stages can help to gauge disease progression. Hence, a simple method
based on lung-pathology interpretable features for scoring disease severity
from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution, this method
correlates well to patient severity in different stages of disease progression
with competitive results compared to other existing, more complex methods. An
original data selection approach is also proposed, allowing the simple model to
learn the severity-related features. It is hypothesized that the resulting
competitive performance presented here is related to the method being
feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or opacity as others in
the literature. A second contribution comes from the validation of the results,
conceptualized as the scoring of patients groups from different stages of the
disease. Besides performing such validation on an independent data set, the
results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the
literature. The results show that there is a significant correlation between
the scoring system (MAVIDH) and patient outcome, which could potentially help
physicians rating and following disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

(1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation,
(5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks
together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of
implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths

novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) affecting the whole world. Like
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are thought to originate in bats and then
spread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying intermediate host
species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms
of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains
a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that
reflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial
mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study
investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different
species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human
and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the
highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values.
In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and
human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live
poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection
in these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether
mouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals

random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the
COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable
controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare
system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes
will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow
informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with
much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time
assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates.
  Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous
population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested
people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current
fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to
real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still
higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in
spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in
place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is
still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of
restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is
demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where
the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.

exchange conserves populations pair-wise, the disorder drives the global system
towards newer routes to dynamic equilibrium. Upon controlling the range of the
exchange fraction, we show that it is possible to control the heterogeneity in
the spread and the co-operativity among the interacting hotspots. Data of

  during the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy","In 2020, countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic implemented various
non-pharmaceutical interventions to contrast the spread of the virus and its
impact on their healthcare systems and economies. Using Italian data at
different geographic scales, we investigate the relationship between human
mobility, which subsumes many facets of the population's response to the
changing situation, and the spread of COVID-19. Leveraging mobile phone data
from February through September 2020, we find a striking relationship between
the decrease in mobility flows and the net reproduction number. We find that
the time needed to switch off mobility and bring the net reproduction number
below the critical threshold of 1 is about one week. Moreover, we observe a
strong relationship between the number of days spent above such threshold
before the lockdown-induced drop in mobility flows and the total number of
infections per 100k inhabitants. Estimating the statistical effect of mobility
flows on the net reproduction number over time, we document a 2-week lag
positive association, strong in March and April, and weaker but still
significant in June. Our study demonstrates the value of big mobility data to
monitor the epidemic and inform control interventions during its unfolding.

spread. It considers: both detected and undetected infected populations,
medical quarantine and social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus
possible reinfection. The coefficients in the model are evaluated by fitting to
empirical data for eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois,
Louisiana, New Jersey, New York State, and Texas. Together these states make up
43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their
initial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The
evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact
and recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are
larger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate
from sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may have been well
underway in several states before first detected and that California might have
seen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on the current
situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than
two years. Should states fully relax stay-at-home orders, most states may
experience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the
number of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most
states that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact
rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown
compliance (from the current $\sim$ 15% to $\sim$ 30%) will eradicate
infections in the state of Texas within a year. Extending our fits for all of
the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including
undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed cases, and 630,000 cumulative
deaths by November 1, 2020.

strategy is dominated by the activity of a limited set of heavy users. The
results underline the necessity to understand the dynamics of discourse

cyclic devastations if required preventive, curative and reformative steps are
not taken up in time which puts forth mammoth multi-dimensional challenges for
survival before mankind. Scientists and policymakers all around are striving to
achieve R $\leq$ 1 alongside having less number of CoVID-19 patients. Lockdowns
all across the globe have been implemented for the sake of social physical
distancing. However, even if the desired R value status is achieved it becomes
nowhere near safe. As normal social activity and inter-regional travel resumes,
danger of contraction of the virus from undetected asymptomatic carriers and
reactivation of the virus in previously affected patients looms over. The virus
poses further threat due to its chances of resurgence, its mutative and
adaptive nature thereby giving limited medical respite. The problems intensify
with increasing population density whilst varying with several
socio-economic-geo-cultural and human activity parameters. Such zoonotic
pandemics unravel the primary challenges of all countries in securing the
general wellbeing of the society. Ensuring a mechanism for policy designs
envisaging crisis scenarios through continuous analysis of real-time
region-specific data about societal activities and disease/health indicators

pandemics like covid-19 require deep learning capabilities at mobile devices

mobile scanner), which are severely constrained by the limited storage and
computation resources at the device level. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-tier architecture, including robot layers, edge layers, and cloud layers.
We adopt this architecture to design a non-contact respiratory monitoring
system to break down respiratory rate calculation tasks. Experimental results
of respiratory rate monitoring show that the proposed approach in this paper
significantly outperforms other approaches. It is supported by computation time
costs with 2.26 ms per frame, 27.48 ms per frame, 0.78 seconds for convolution
operation, similarity calculation, processing one-minute length respiratory
signals, respectively. And the computation time costs of our three-tier
architecture are less than that of edge+cloud architecture and cloud
architecture. Moreover, we use our three-tire architecture for CT image
diagnosis task decomposition. The evaluation of a CT image dataset of COVID-19
proves that our three-tire architecture is useful for resolving tasks on deep
learning networks by edge equipment. There are broad application scenarios in
smart hospitals in the future.

reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic. We
specifically target statements related to the COVID-19 health emergency, that

the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Current predictive
models of the development of COVID-19, especially after mitigation efforts, are
largely based on extrapolating the data from other countries. Since most states
enforced stay-at-home orders towards the end of March, their effect should be
reflected in the death and infection counts at the end of April. Using the data
available until April 25th, we investigate the change in the infection rate due
to the mitigation efforts, and project death and infection counts until
September, 2020, for some of the most heavily impacted states: New York, New
Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and Louisiana. We find that with the
current mitigation efforts five of those six states reduce their reproduction
number to a value less than one, stopping the exponential growth of the
pandemic. We also projected different scenarios after the mitigation is
relaxed. Analysis for other states can be found at

warning system that predicts the locations of outbreaks is of crucial
importance. Studies have shown the effectiveness of using large-scale mobility
data to monitor the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,
lockdowns) through population density analysis. However, predicting the
locations of potential outbreak occurrence is difficult using mobility data
alone. Meanwhile, web search queries have been shown to be good predictors of
the disease spread. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset of human
mobility trajectories (GPS traces) and web search queries with common user
identifiers (> 450K users), to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations beforehand.
More specifically, web search query analysis is conducted to identify users
with high risk of COVID-19 contraction, and social contact analysis was further
performed on the mobility patterns of these users to quantify the risk of an
outbreak. Our approach is empirically tested using data collected from users in
Tokyo, Japan. We show that by integrating COVID-19 related web search query
analytics with social contact networks, we are able to predict COVID-19 hotspot
locations 1-2 weeks beforehand, compared to just using social contact indexes
or web search data analysis. This study proposes a novel method that can be
used in early warning systems for disease outbreak hotspots, which can assist

key knowledge for the authorities to prepare for the health systems demand or
to apply restrictions to slow down the infectives curve. Even when the model
can be easily solved ---by the use of specialized software or by programming

question is what we can use of one city to another; if what happened in Madrid

we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate

the various discursive communities based on how verified users are perceived by
standard ones: if two verified accounts are considered as similar by non

observe that, beside being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion
show a clear division in what results to be different political groups. At this

assess the reputation of the pieces of news exchanged. We filter the network of

peculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a
fourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the
average random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF

pathogens contain asymptomatic phenotypes amongst their ranks, as evident
during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Spreading of diseases has been studied
extensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased
(SIRD) dynamics. Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease
spread, many of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as
states. Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for
the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease.
It is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing masks
and social distancing significantly mitigate the spread of many contagious
diseases. Herein, we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies
and treat S, I, R, and D as states. We also attempt to capture the differences
in epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic diseases on
various network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine
that the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of
mass testing in a population affects the final fraction of socially responsible
individuals. We observe that the lack of mass testing could potentially lead to
a pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology also seems to
play an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive
individuals depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as
proactive individuals. Additionally, edge density can significantly influence
the overall outcome. Our findings are in broad agreement with the lessons
learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19. Given n samples collected from patients, how should we select and
test mixtures of samples to maximize information and minimize the number of
tests? Group testing is a well-studied problem with several appealing
solutions, but recent biological studies impose practical constraints for
COVID-19 that are incompatible with traditional methods. Furthermore, existing
methods use unnecessarily restrictive solutions, which were devised for
settings with more memory and compute constraints than the problem at hand.
This results in poor utility. In the new setting, we obtain strong solutions
for small values of n using evolutionary strategies. We then develop a new
method combining Bloom filters with belief propagation to scale to larger
values of n (more than 100) with good empirical results. We also present a more
accurate decoding algorithm that is tailored for specific COVID-19 settings.
This work demonstrates the practical gap between dedicated algorithms and
well-known generic solutions. Our efforts results in a new and practical
multiplex method yielding strong empirical performance without mixing more than
a chosen number of patients into the same probe. Finally, we briefly discuss
adaptive methods, casting them into the framework of adaptive sub-modularity.

  Retrieval Systems for COVID-19 Literature","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a tremendous need for access to the
latest scientific information, primarily through the use of text mining and
search tools. This has led to both corpora for biomedical articles related to
COVID-19 (such as the CORD-19 corpus (Wang et al., 2020)) as well as search
engines to query such data. While most research in search engines is performed
in the academic field of information retrieval (IR), most academic search
engines$\unicode{x2013}$though rigorously evaluated$\unicode{x2013}$are
sparsely utilized, while major commercial web search engines (e.g., Google,
Bing) dominate. This relates to COVID-19 because it can be expected that
commercial search engines deployed for the pandemic will gain much higher
traction than those produced in academic labs, and thus leads to questions
about the empirical performance of these search tools. This paper seeks to
empirically evaluate two such commercial search engines for COVID-19, produced
by Google and Amazon, in comparison to the more academic prototypes evaluated
in the context of the TREC-COVID track (Roberts et al., 2020). We performed
several steps to reduce bias in the available manual judgments in order to
ensure a fair comparison of the two systems with those submitted to TREC-COVID.
We find that the top-performing system from TREC-COVID on bpref metric
performed the best among the different systems evaluated in this study on all

  UK Consumer Spending","We show the recovery in consumer spending in the United Kingdom through the
second half of 2020 is unevenly distributed across regions. We utilise Fable
Data: a real-time source of consumption data that is a highly correlated,
leading indicator of Bank of England and Office for National Statistics data.
The UK's recovery is heavily weighted towards the ""home counties"" around outer
London and the South. We observe a stark contrast between strong online
spending growth while offline spending contracts. The strongest recovery in
spending is seen in online spending in the ""commuter belt"" areas in outer
London and the surrounding localities and also in areas of high second home
ownership, where working from home (including working from second homes) has
significantly displaced the location of spending. Year-on-year spending growth
in November 2020 in localities facing the UK's new tighter ""Tier 3""
restrictions (mostly the midlands and northern areas) was 38.4% lower compared
with areas facing the less restrictive ""Tier 2"" (mostly London and the South).
These patterns had been further exacerbated during November 2020 when a second
national lockdown was imposed. To prevent such COVID-19-driven regional
inequalities from becoming persistent we propose governments introduce
temporary, regionally-targeted interventions in 2021. The availability of
real-time, regional data enables policymakers to efficiently decide when, where
and how to implement such regional interventions and to be able to rapidly
evaluate their effectiveness to consider whether to expand, modify or remove
them.

decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different
Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise,
related to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there

  Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach","To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the
passenger's perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage,
airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews
(OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics
approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted
using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and
two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,
we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the
individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most
representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a
review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the
predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot
of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established
by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a
bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis
within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the
proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective
performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR.
Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our
results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the
airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.

Alongside this pandemic, people have experienced a parallel infodemic, i.e., an

  during the COVID-19 lockdown: implications for haze mitigation","The COVID-19 outbreak greatly limited human activities and reduced primary
emissions particularly from urban on-road vehicles, but coincided with Beijing
experiencing pandemic haze, raising the public concerns of the validity and
effectiveness of the imposed traffic policies to improve the air pollution.
Here, we explored the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the
winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period based on
an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission
inventory, in-situ air quality observations and a localized chemical transport
modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially
affected by the pandemic, with a higher reduction for NOx (75.9%, 125.3 Mg/day)
compared to VOCs (53.1%, 52.9 Mg/day). Unexpectedly, our results show that the
imbalanced emission abatement of NOx and VOCs from vehicles led to a
significant rise of the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in urban areas, but only
resulting in modest increases in secondary aerosols due to the inadequate
precursors. However, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions
greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors,
which is mainly responsible for Beijing haze during the lockdown period. Our
results indicate that the winter haze in Beijing was insensitive to the local
vehicular emissions reduction due to the complicated nonlinear response of the
fine particle and air pollutant emissions. We suggest mitigation policies
should focus on accelerating VOC and NH3 emissions reduction and synchronously
controlling regional sources to release the benefits on local traffic emission
control.

Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation to the anti-COVID-19 policies
applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of COVID-19 and
the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis
builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19
infection-curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization
algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining
periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal
a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting
with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern
intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending
up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek
COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also
illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes,
implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and
high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The
overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel
method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better
forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices

  COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly
worldwide, leading to a global outbreak. Most governments, enterprises, and
scientific research institutions are participating in the COVID-19 struggle to
curb the spread of the pandemic. As a powerful tool against COVID-19,
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely used in combating this
pandemic. In this survey, we investigate the main scope and contributions of AI
in combating COVID-19 from the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis,
virology and pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and
transmission prediction. In addition, we summarize the available data and
resources that can be used for AI-based COVID-19 research. Finally, the main
challenges and potential directions of AI in fighting against COVID-19 are
discussed. Currently, AI mainly focuses on medical image inspection, genomics,
drug development, and transmission prediction, and thus AI still has great
potential in this field. This survey presents medical and AI researchers with a
comprehensive view of the existing and potential applications of AI technology
in combating COVID-19 with the goal of inspiring researchers to continue to
maximize the advantages of AI and big data to fight COVID-19.

where none of the middle entities can be trusted. We believe that it can be
achieved with small changes to the existing mechanism: random numbers are
generated on the application side instead of the OS, and the positive test
results are reported to a public ledger (e.g. blockchain) rather than to a
government server, with endorsements from the medical institutes with blind
signatures. We also discuss how to incentivize the peer-to-peer maintenance of
the public ledger if it should be newly built. We show that the level of
verifiability is much higher with our proposed design if a consumer group were
to verify the privacy protections of the deployed systems. We believe that this
will allow for safer contact tracing, and contribute to healthier lifestyles
for citizens who may want to or have to go out under pandemic situations.

transmission rates is taken as the objective function to derive scenarios with
a low level transmission risk. After the determination of an appropriate seat

one method is better than the other using those forecasts because each team's
submission may correspond to different techniques over the period and involve
human interventions as the teams are continuously changing/tuning their
approach. Such forecasts may be considered ""human-expert"" forecasts and do not
qualify as AI/ML approaches, although they can be used as an indicator of human
expert performance. We are interested in supporting AI/ML research in epidemic
forecasting which can lead to scalable forecasting without human intervention.
Which modeling technique, learning strategy, and data pre-processing technique

the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic under varying policy scenarios. Agents
differ with regard to their profession, family status and age and interact with
other agents at home, work or during leisure activities. The model allows to
implement and test actually used or counterfactual policies such as closing
schools or the leisure industry explicitly in the model in order to explore
their impact on the spread of the virus, and their economic consequences. The
model is calibrated with German statistical data on time use, demography,
households, firm demography, employment, company profits and wages. I set up a
baseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit the
epidemiological parameters of the simulation to the observed German death curve
and an estimated infection curve of the first COVID-19 wave. My model suggests
that by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in Germany
would have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if the
policies had been enacted a week earlier. I finally discuss two stylized fiscal
policy scenarios: procyclical (zero-deficit) and anticyclical fiscal policy. In
the zero-deficit scenario a vicious circle emerges, in which the economic
recession spreads from the high-interaction leisure industry to the rest of the
economy. Even after eliminating the virus and lifting the restrictions, the
economic recovery is incomplete. Anticyclical fiscal policy on the other hand
limits the economic losses and allows for a V-shaped recovery, but does not
increase the number of deaths. These results suggest that an optimal response
to the pandemic aiming at containment or holding out for a vaccine combines
early introduction of containment measures to keep the number of infected low
with expansionary fiscal policy to keep output in lower risk sectors high.

  Segmentation in CT Images","One of the key challenges in the battle against the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic is to detect and quantify the severity of the disease in a timely
manner. Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the
state of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time
and effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge
introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that
accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning
methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision,
but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be
redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that
promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system
allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much
cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source
COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled
regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these
regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient
than labeling whole images. Finally, we show that with only 7\% of the labeling
effort required to label the whole training set gives us around 90\% of the
performance obtained by training the model on the fully annotated training set.

connect with large Internet service providers (eyeball networks) through
dedicated private peering. The capacity of these private network interconnects
is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users.
Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a
content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect
may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the
excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are
rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet
service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and
disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid
by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic
overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be
able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs
and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based
on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short
term horizon of 2-6 hours and predict the specific interconnections that will
ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic
measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a
true-positive rate of 0.8 while maintaining a 0.05 false-positive rate. The
lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the overflow prediction
accuracy. Nevertheless, starting from the end of April 2020 with the gradual

spread and symptoms severity. However, in the viral Spike protein, which is
responsible for host cell attachment and invasion, an emergent variant,
containing the amino acid substitution D to G in position 614 (D614G), was
suggested to increase viral infection capability. To test whether this variant
has epidemiological impact, the temporal distributions of the SARS-CoV-2
samples bearing D or G at position 614 were compared in the USA, Asia and
Europe. The epidemiological curves were compared at early and late epidemic
stages. At early stages, where containment measures were still not fully
implemented, the viral variants are supposed to be unconstrained and its growth
curves might approximate the free viral dynamics. Our analysis shows that the
D614G prevalence and the growth rates of COVID-19 epidemic curves are
correlated in the USA, Asia and Europe. Our results suggest a selective sweep
that can be explained, at least in part, by a propagation advantage of this
variant, in other words, that the molecular level effects of D614G have
sufficient impact on population transmission dynamics as to be detected by
differences in rate coefficients of epidemic growth curves.

  Imbalanced Data and its Application to COVID-19 X-Ray Classification","We propose a highly data-efficient classification and active learning
framework for classifying chest X-rays. It is based on (1) unsupervised
representation learning of a Convolutional Neural Network and (2) the Gaussian
Process method. The unsupervised representation learning employs
self-supervision that does not require class labels, and the learned features
are proven to achieve label-efficient classification. GP is a kernel-based
Bayesian approach that also leads to data-efficient predictions with the added
benefit of estimating each decision's uncertainty. Our novel framework combines
these two elements in sequence to achieve highly data and label efficient
classifications. Moreover, both elements are less sensitive to the prevalent
and challenging class imbalance issue, thanks to the (1) feature learned
without labels and (2) the Bayesian nature of GP. The GP-provided uncertainty
estimates enable active learning by ranking samples based on the uncertainty
and selectively labeling samples showing higher uncertainty. We apply this
novel combination to the data-deficient and severely imbalanced case of
COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. We demonstrate that only $\sim 10\%$ of
the labeled data is needed to reach the accuracy from training all available
labels. Its application to the COVID-19 data in a fully supervised
classification scenario shows that our model, with a generic ResNet backbone,
outperforms (COVID-19 case by 4\%) the state-of-the-art model with a highly
tuned architecture. Our model architecture and proposed framework are general
and straightforward to apply to a broader class of datasets, with expected
success.

healthcare applications continue to suffer from poor adoption due to their
limitations in meeting stringent security, privacy, and quality of service
requirements (such as low latency). The edge computing trend, along with
techniques for distributed machine learning such as federated learning, have
gained popularity as a viable solution in such settings. In this paper, we
leverage the capabilities of edge computing in medicine by analyzing and
evaluating the potential of intelligent processing of clinical visual data at
the edge allowing the remote healthcare centers, lacking advanced diagnostic
facilities, to benefit from the multi-modal data securely. To this aim, we
utilize the emerging concept of clustered federated learning (CFL) for an

burden on healthcare systems across the world that has been under a lot of
stress since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in late 2019. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework under different experimental setups on
two benchmark datasets. Promising results are obtained on both datasets
resulting in comparable results against the central baseline where the
specialized models (i.e., each on a specific type of COVID-19 imagery) are
trained with central data, and improvements of 16\% and 11\% in overall

  activity across the cell membrane","Clustering of ligand-binding receptors of different types on thickened isles
of the cell membrane, namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed
phenomenon. Although its influence on cell response is deeply investigated, the
role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving
the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding
has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate specific cell processes
through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between
the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the
intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance
Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based
on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass
balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and
kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon
both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and
of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell
membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering
of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active
receptors -in agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels- and how the
latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current
scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often
serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for
strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in
better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell
interaction.

  in the US","Recent re-opening policies in the US, following a period of social distancing
measures, introduced a significant increase in daily COVID-19 infections,
calling for a roll-back or substantial revisiting of these policies in many
states. The situation is suggestive of difficulties modeling the impact of
partial distancing/re-opening policies on future epidemic spread for purposes
of choosing safe alternatives. More specifically, one needs to understand the
impact of manipulating the availability of social interaction venues (e.g.,
schools, workplaces, and retail establishments) on virus spread. We introduce a
model, inspired by social networks research, that answers the above question.
Our model compartmentalizes interaction venues into categories we call mixing
domains, enabling one to predict COVID-19 contagion trends in different
geographic regions under different what if assumptions on partial re-opening of
individual domains. We apply our model to several highly impacted states
showing (i) how accurately it predicts the extent of current resurgence (from
available policy descriptions), and (ii) what alternatives might be more
effective at mitigating the second wave. We further compare policies that rely
on partial venue closure to policies that espouse wide-spread periodic testing
instead (i.e., in lieu of social distancing). Our models predict that the
benefits of (mandatory) testing out-shadow the benefits of partial venue
closure, suggesting that perhaps more efforts should be directed to such a
mitigation strategy.

proportion has been well studied in the literature owing to its wide range of

sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers
from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been
developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the
optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance

developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of
shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas
for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation
studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or

a strong correlation between the use of the slur and anti-Asian hate crimes

To compare the methods, we performed three experiments: In the first one, we

one, we use data from all fifty countries to train and predict each of them. In
the first and second experiment, we used a static hold-out approach for all

sequentially, using a prequential evaluation. This scheme is not suitable for
most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms because they need to be

stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous
dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary

visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As
the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where
in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19

exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great
practical relevance to investigate the network trans-mission of contagious
diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely
studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the
so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in
determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will
cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds
from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major
challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the
epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally
efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu
modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk
sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small
fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and
demonstrate their empirical superiority.

we present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and
forecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data,
reported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care
occupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering
technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases,
critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and
September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model
hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the
recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the
Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were
constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the
reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase
again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over
Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to
provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very
good for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the

  Ahead of COVID-19 Outbreak","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has crushed daily routines and is
still rampaging through the world. Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical
interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of
residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial
distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the
subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or
slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for
being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are
usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose
C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every
neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the
spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher
collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then
characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of
features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the
firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local
outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn
""city-invariant"" representations from the mobility-related features for precise
early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases
known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher
using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the

diseases including the COVID-19. More recently, many works construct deep
neural networks (DNNs) for chest X-ray images to realize automated and
efficient diagnosis of lung diseases. However, bias field caused by the
improper medical image acquisition process widely exists in the chest X-ray
images while the robustness of DNNs to the bias field is rarely explored, which
definitely poses a threat to the X-ray-based automated diagnosis system. In
this paper, we study this problem based on the recent adversarial attack and
propose a brand new attack, i.e., the adversarial bias field attack where the
bias field instead of the additive noise works as the adversarial perturbations
for fooling the DNNs. This novel attack posts a key problem: how to locally
tune the bias field to realize high attack success rate while maintaining its
spatial smoothness to guarantee high realisticity. These two goals contradict
each other and thus has made the attack significantly challenging. To overcome
this challenge, we propose the adversarial-smooth bias field attack that can
locally tune the bias field with joint smooth & adversarial constraints. As a
result, the adversarial X-ray images can not only fool the DNNs effectively but
also retain very high level of realisticity. We validate our method on real
chest X-ray datasets with powerful DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, DenseNet121, and
MobileNet, and show different properties to the state-of-the-art attacks in
both image realisticity and attack transferability. Our method reveals the
potential threat to the DNN-based X-ray automated diagnosis and can definitely
benefit the development of bias-field-robust automated diagnosis system.

appropriate population pyramid, contact rate matrices, external arrivals (as
per actual data), and a few other calibrated fractions based on the reported
cases of Covid-19 in India. Also, we have explicitly modeled, using independent

Covid-positive patients, quarantining, use of mask/better hygiene practices,
social distancing through contact rate reductions at distinct zones of home(H),

contacts of positive patients and quarantining them, in combination with use of
face masks and personal hygiene. A wide range of combination of effectiveness
of contact tracing, isolation, quarantining and personal hygiene measures help
minimize the pandemic impact and some imperfections in implementation of one

differently by different socioeconomic groups and business industries. In this
study, we study aggregate mobility patterns of New York City and Chicago to
identify the relationship between the amount of interpersonal contact between
people in urban neighborhoods and the disparity in the growth of positive cases
among these groups. We introduce an aggregate Contact Exposure Index (CEI) to
measure exposure due to this interpersonal contact and combine it with social
distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of
structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of exposure on case
growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in
lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth
via contact exposure. Using the CEI, schools and restaurants are identified as
high-exposure industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing
specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories are most
effective. This analysis can be useful in providing insights for government
officials targeting specific population groups and businesses to reduce
infection spread as reopening efforts continue to expand across the nation.

suddenness and heterogeneity across industries. To study the upstream and
downstream propagation of these industry-specific demand and supply shocks, we
build a dynamic input-output model inspired by previous work on the economic
response to natural disasters. We argue that standard production functions, at
least in their most parsimonious parametrizations, are not adequate to model
input substitutability in the context of Covid-19 shocks. We use a survey of
industry analysts to evaluate, for each industry, which inputs were absolutely
necessary for production over a short time period. We calibrate our model on
the UK economy and study the economic effects of the lockdown that was imposed
at the end of March and gradually released in May. Looking back at predictions
that we released in May, we show that the model predicted aggregate dynamics
very well, and sectoral dynamics to a large extent. We discuss the relative
extent to which the model's dynamics and performance was due to the choice of
the production function or the choice of an exogenous shock scenario. To
further explore the behavior of the model, we use simpler scenarios with only
demand or supply shocks, and find that popular metrics used to predict a priori
the impact of shocks, such as output multipliers, are only mildly useful.

global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. While governments and healthcare
agencies are eager to mandate the deployment of such applications en-masse,
they face increasing scrutiny from the popular press, security companies, and
human rights watch agencies that fear the exploitation of these technologies as
surveillance tools. Finding the optimal balance between community safety and
privacy has been a challenge, and strategies to address these concerns have
varied among countries. This paper describes two important attacks that affect
a broad swath of contact-tracing applications. The first, referred to as
contact-isolation attack, is a user-privacy attack that can be used to identify
potentially infected patients in your neighborhood. The second is a
contact-pollution attack that affects the integrity of contact tracing
applications by causing them to produce a high volume of false-positive alerts.
We developed prototype implementations and evaluated both attacks in the
context of the DP-3T application framework, but these vulnerabilities affect a
much broader class of applications. We found that both attacks are feasible and
realizable with a minimal attacker work factor. We further conducted an impact
assessment of these attacks by using a simulation study and measurements from
the SafeGraph database. Our results indicate that attacks launched from a
modest number (on the order of 10,000) of monitoring points can effectively
decloak between 5-40\% of infected users in a major metropolis, such as
Houston.

quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking
process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection
status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider
based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression
for this average difference for given test rates, and given infection and
recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based
algorithm to minimize this average difference. We observe that if the total
test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally,
only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and
recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track
the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size
increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates,
which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby
improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care
provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either
the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.

is aimed at combining detection and reconstruction of correlational and
quasi-periodic motifs in the viral genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The motifs
reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations
and can be tried as putative therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the
relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The
applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
(the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic)
packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is
transported into spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike
glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of viruses with
icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage
PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved
due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and
nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural
selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences.
Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of numerous molecular
mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete
repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory
elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.

  COVID-19 pandemic","In March 2020, the Austrian government introduced a widespread lock-down in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on subjective impressions and
anecdotal evidence, Austrian public and private life came to a sudden halt.
Here we assess the effect of the lock-down quantitatively for all regions in
Austria and present an analysis of daily changes of human mobility throughout
Austria using near-real-time anonymized mobile phone data. We describe an
efficient data aggregation pipeline and analyze the mobility by quantifying
mobile-phone traffic at specific point of interest (POI), analyzing individual
trajectories and investigating the cluster structure of the origin-destination
graph. We found a reduction of commuters at Viennese metro stations of over
80\% and the number of devices with a radius of gyration of less than 500 m
almost doubled. The results of studying crowd-movement behavior highlight
considerable changes in the structure of mobility networks, revealed by a
higher modularity and an increase from 12 to 20 detected communities. We
demonstrate the relevance of mobility data for epidemiological studies by
showing a significant correlation of the outflow from the town of Ischgl (an
early COVID-19 hotspot) and the reported COVID-19 cases with an 8-day time lag.
This research indicates that mobile phone usage data permits the
moment-by-moment quantification of mobility behavior for a whole country. We
emphasize the need to improve the availability of such data in anonymized form
to empower rapid response to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics.

  matter","I critique a recent analysis (Miles, Stedman & Heald, 2020) of COVID-19
lockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.
(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit
of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks
from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the
benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000
deaths weekly by mid-September.
  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and
cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut
off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they
assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths
and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes
that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or
social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary
lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under
these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of
serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for
survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in
deaths.
  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without
estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness
costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.

metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) field-effect at the electrical contacts to
2D materials: the field-effect depletes or accumulates charge carriers,
redistributes the voltage potential, and give rise to abnormal current
saturation and nonlinearity. On the one hand, the current saturation hinders
the devices' driving ability, which can be eliminated with carefully engineered
contact configurations. On the other hand, by introducing the nonlinearity to
monolithic analog artificial neural network circuits, the circuits' perception
ability can be significantly enhanced, as evidenced using a COVID-19 critical

disease; in particular, the pre-existing learning crisis is expected to be
magnified during school shutdown. Despite efforts to put distance learning
strategies in place, the threat of student dropouts, especially among
adolescents, looms as a major concern. Are interventions to motivate
adolescents to stay in school effective amidst the pandemic? Here we show that,
in Brazil, nudges via text messages to high-school students, to motivate them
to stay engaged with school activities, substantially reduced dropouts during
school shutdown, and greatly increased their motivation to go back to school
when classes resume. While such nudges had been shown to decrease dropouts
during normal times, it is surprising that those impacts replicate in the
absence of regular classes because their effects are typically mediated by
teachers (whose effort in the classroom changes in response to the nudges).
Results show that insights from the science of adolescent psychology can be
leveraged to shift developmental trajectories at a critical juncture. They also
qualify those insights: effects increase with exposure and gradually fade out
once communication stops, providing novel evidence that motivational
interventions work by redirecting adolescents' attention.

  classification. Application to COVID-19 diagnosis in chest X-ray images","Respiratory diseases kill million of people each year. Diagnosis of these
pathologies is a manual, time-consuming process that has inter and
intra-observer variability, delaying diagnosis and treatment. The recent
COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need of developing systems to automatize
the diagnosis of pneumonia, whilst Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) have
proved to be an excellent option for the automatic classification of medical
images. However, given the need of providing a confidence classification in
this context it is crucial to quantify the reliability of the model's
predictions. In this work, we propose a multi-level ensemble classification
system based on a Bayesian Deep Learning approach in order to maximize
performance while quantifying the uncertainty of each classification decision.
This tool combines the information extracted from different architectures by
weighting their results according to the uncertainty of their predictions.
Performance of the Bayesian network is evaluated in a real scenario where
simultaneously differentiating between four different pathologies: control vs
bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 pneumonia. A three-level
decision tree is employed to divide the 4-class classification into three
binary classifications, yielding an accuracy of 98.06% and overcoming the
results obtained by recent literature. The reduced preprocessing needed for
obtaining this high performance, in addition to the information provided about
the reliability of the predictions evidence the applicability of the system to

  Analysis and Implications","Most work to date on mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is focused urgently on
biomedicine and epidemiology. Yet, pandemic-related policy decisions cannot be
made on health information alone. Decisions need to consider the broader
impacts on people and their needs. Quantifying human needs across the
population is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high
coverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and
other external effects. Here, we propose a computational methodology, building
on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can capture a holistic view of relative
changes in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences
approach that corrects for seasonality and volume variations. We apply this
approach to characterize changes in human needs across physiological,
socioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35
billion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14
months. The analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has
increased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the
pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and
variations in statewide policies, we find that the durations of
shelter-in-place mandates have influenced social and emotional needs
significantly. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical
needs, such as support for unemployment and domestic violence, can be
identified through web search interactions. Our approach and results suggest
that population-scale monitoring of shifts in human needs can inform policies
and recovery efforts for current and anticipated needs.

around the world went into lockdown and imposed unprecedented containment
measures. These restrictions progressively produced changes to social behavior
and global mobility patterns, evidently disrupting social and economic
activities. Here, using maritime traffic data collected via a global network of
AIS receivers, we analyze the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic and
containment measures had on the shipping industry, which accounts alone for
more than 80% of the world trade. We rely on multiple data-driven maritime
mobility indexes to quantitatively assess ship mobility in a given unit of
time. The mobility analysis here presented has a worldwide extent and is based
on the computation of: CNM of all ships reporting their position and
navigational status via AIS, number of active and idle ships, and fleet average
speed. To highlight significant changes in shipping routes and operational
patterns, we also compute and compare global and local density maps. We compare
2020 mobility levels to those of previous years assuming that an unchanged
growth rate would have been achieved, if not for COVID-19. Following the
outbreak, we find an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all
categories of commercial shipping. With few exceptions, a generally reduced
activity is observable from March to June, when the most severe restrictions
were in force. We quantify a variation of mobility between -5.62% and -13.77%
for container ships, between +2.28% and -3.32% for dry bulk, between -0.22% and
-9.27% for wet bulk, and between -19.57% and -42.77% for passenger traffic.
This study is unprecedented for the uniqueness and completeness of the employed

ships, a figure that closely parallels the documented size of the world

We observe that GNNs can identify P0 close to the theoretical bound on
accuracy, without explicit input of dynamics or its parameters. In addition,
GNN is over 100 times faster than classic methods for inference on arbitrary
graph topologies. Our theoretical bound also shows that the epidemic is like a
ticking clock, emphasizing the importance of early contact-tracing. We find a

become a worldwide problem with devastating consequences. To slow down the
spread of the pandemic, mass quarantines have been implemented globally,
provoking further social and economic disruptions. Here, we implement a
comprehensive contact tracing network analysis to find an optimized quarantine
protocol to dismantle the chain of transmission of coronavirus with minimal
disruptions to society. We track billions of anonymized GPS human mobility
datapoints from a compilation of hundreds of mobile apps deployed in Latin
America to monitor the evolution of the contact network of disease transmission
before and after the confinements. As a consequence of the lockdowns, people's
mobility across the region decreases by $\sim$53\%, which results in a drastic
disintegration of the transmission network by $\sim$90\%. However, this
disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis
indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission
network to prolong the pandemic. Once the k-cores are identified, an optimized
strategy to break the chain of transmission is to quarantine a minimal number
of 'weak links' with high betweenness centrality connecting the large k-cores.
As countries built contact tracing apps to fight the pandemic, our results
could turn into a valuable resource to help deploy quarantine protocols with
minimized disruptions.

  epidemiological applications","The scientific rigor and computational methods of causal inference have had
great impacts on many disciplines, but have only recently begun to take hold in
spatial applications. Spatial casual inference poses analytic challenges due to
complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one
location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current
literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We
first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured
confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of
spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the
complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are
extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential
outcomes framework with Granger causality, and to geostatistical analyses
involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are
introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological
studies, and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the
effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement
many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.

interventions, either by distancing or by treatment. Results revealed that
total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission.
However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for
France). By setting the end of intervention as the day when hospital capacity
is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up
to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results
pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after

  Uncertainty-aware Learning for Robust COVID-19 Detection","The novel 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread world widely and
is currently a major healthcare challenge around the world. Chest Computed
Tomography (CT) and X-ray images have been well recognized to be two effective
techniques for clinical COVID-19 disease diagnoses. Due to faster imaging time
and considerably lower cost than CT, detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray (CXR)
images is preferred for efficient diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However,
considering the similarity between COVID-19 and pneumonia, CXR samples with
deep features distributed near category boundaries are easily misclassified by
the hyper-planes learned from limited training data. Moreover, most existing
approaches for COVID-19 detection focus on the accuracy of prediction and
overlook the uncertainty estimation, which is particularly important when
dealing with noisy datasets. To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel
deep network named {\em RCoNet$^k_s$} for robust COVID-19 detection which
employs {\em Deformable Mutual Information Maximization} (DeIM), {\em Mixed
High-order Moment Feature} (MHMF) and {\em Multi-expert Uncertainty-aware
Learning} (MUL). With DeIM, the mutual information (MI) between input data and
the corresponding latent representations can be well estimated and maximized to
capture compact and disentangled representational characteristics. Meanwhile,
MHMF can fully explore the benefits of using high-order statistics and extract
discriminative features of complex distributions in medical imaging. Finally,
MUL creates multiple parallel dropout networks for each CXR image to evaluate
uncertainty and thus prevent performance degradation caused by the noise in the
data.

  systematic review","OBJECTIVES: Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 vary
across countries. This paper aims to characterise the spatial variability in R0
across the first six months of the global COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore
social factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.
  METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from
January to June 2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that
provided R0 estimates. For each study, the value of the estimate, country under
study and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value was calculated
per country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each
country with an R0 estimate, the Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable
Mobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and development status
were obtained from external sources.
  RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies
provided at least one estimate of R0, along with sufficient methodology to
explain how the value was calculated. Values of R0 ranged between 0.48 and
14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.
  CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the
estimates of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights
the spatial heterogeneity in R0. Higher values were recorded in more developed
countries, and countries with an older population or more sustainable mobility.
Countries with higher population density had lower R0 estimates. For most
regions, variability in R0 spiked initially before reducing and stabilising as
more estimates became available.

  Memory Models","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been posing severe threat to public
health around the world by causing the infectious coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). A key challenge of controlling COVID-19 is the large proportion of
asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (ACCs) that makes breaking the transmission chains
even harder. Unfortunately, till now there is still a lack of cost-effective
approaches to detect ACCs except doing a medical screening of the entire
population. This paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal
Episodic Memory for COVID-19 tracing (STEM-COVID) for identifying ACCs from
contact tracing data. Based on fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (fusion ART),
STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal
episodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs
can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the
episodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the
effectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is
implemented based on recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experimental
results based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model
is able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and
efficiency.

argue that a strategy based uniquely on social distancing requires to maintain

which also uses early detection and prompt isolation, can be both more
efficient on reducing the epidemic peak and allow to relax the social
distancing measures after a much shorter time. We consider in more detail the

territories safe by isolating themselves from others, limiting non-essential
travel and imposing mandatory quarantines for travelers. While large-scale
quarantine has been the most successful short-term policy, it is unsustainable
over long periods as it exerts enormous costs on societies. As a result,
governments which have been able to partially control the spread of the disease
have been deciding to reopen businesses. However, the WHO has warned about the
risks of re-opening prematurely, as is playing out in some countries such as
Spain, France and various states in the US such as California, Florida,
Arizona, and Texas. Thus, it is urgent to consider a flexible policy that
limits transmission without requiring large scale and damaging quarantines.
Here, we have designed a multi-level quarantine process based on the mobility
patterns of individuals and the severity of COVID-19 contagion in the US. By
identifying the natural boundaries of social mobility, policymakers can impose
travel restrictions that are minimally disruptive to social and economic
activity. The dynamics of social fragmentation during the COVID-19 outbreak are
analyzed by applying the Louvain method with modularity optimization to weekly
mobility networks. In a multi-scale community detection process, using the
locations of confirmed cases, natural break points as well as high risk areas
for contagion are identified. At the smaller scales, for communities with a
higher number of confirmed cases, contact tracing and associated quarantine
policies is increasingly important and can be informed by the community
structure.

exposed people. While mechanics compartment models are widely used in epidemic
modeling, data-driven models are emerging for disease forecasting. We first
formalize the learning of physics-based models as AutoODE, which leverages
automatic differentiation to estimate the model parameters. Through a benchmark
study on COVID-19 forecasting, we notice that physics-based mechanistic models
significantly outperform deep learning. Our method obtains a 57.4% reduction in
mean absolute errors for 7-day ahead COVID-19 forecasting compared with the
best deep learning competitor. Such performance differences highlight the
generalization problem in dynamical system learning due to distribution shift.
We identify two scenarios where distribution shift can occur: changes in data
domain and changes in parameter domain (system dynamics). Through systematic
experiments on several dynamical systems, we found that deep learning models
fail to forecast well under both scenarios. While much research on distribution
shift has focused on changes in the data domain, our work calls attention to

  efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS,
  MERS and 2019-nCov literature","During the current century, each major coronavirus outbreak has triggered a
quick surge of academic publications on this topic. The spike in research
publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19), however, has been
like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised
scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than
12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day.
With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to
have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here,
scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted
with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. SARS and MERS.
The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and
citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain
recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three
outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies:
(i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii)
studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii)
studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies
affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they
overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other
categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader
variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the
geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of
each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19
studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of
countries compared to SARS and MRS.

  leverages the Maker movement","Without any major changes, a pilot version of a physical science lab course
was able to continue when the COVID-19 crisis necessitated the abrupt
suspension of on-campus education. The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students
conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers,
required students to follow the entire arc of an empirical research cycle
twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was
based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of
experimental research and methods of scientific research. The flipped classroom
approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the
students' actual experiments were carried out independently at home or
elsewhere without the in-person supervision of an instructor. Despite the
COVID-19 measures, all students were able to produce interesting and successful
research projects. While there were of course difficulties encountered due to
the abrupt transition to online teaching, we found several counterbalancing
advantages that bear consideration for inclusion even when all teaching
activities can return to campus. We believe that three components in the design
of the course were vital to the resilience of the course: the choice for fully
open-inquiry projects, the decision to use Arduinos as measurement tools, and
the flipped aspect of the instruction methods. We also include considerations
for adapting these pandemic-resilient methods in other courses and programs.

health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a
complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid
identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases.
The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in
the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and
imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty
Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP
using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional
features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each
case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a
hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph.
The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score
measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process
of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case
belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia
dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five
hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on
the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

explain this system need to also incorporate noise or fluctuations that can
account for the observed variability. In this work, a stochastic model of the
immune response system is presented in terms of the dynamics of the T cells and
the virus particles. Making use of the Green's function and the Wilemski-Fixman
approximation, this model is then solved to obtain the analytical expression
for the joint probability density function of these variables in the early and
late stages of infection. This is then also used to calculate the average level
of virus particles in the system. Upon comparing the theoretically predicted
average virus levels to those of COVID-19 patients, it is hypothesized that the
long lived dynamics that are characteristic of such viral infections are due to
the long range correlations in the temporal fluctuations of the virions. This
model therefore provides an insight into the effects of noise on viral
dynamics.

  Argentina and forecasting mental health and emotions","Purpose. We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and
emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based
on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits
anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.
Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which
link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines
for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation
with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support
their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for
the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series
forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the
emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders
can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when
limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).
Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict
mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective
level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a
forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or
group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe
that this work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological
processes related to crisis manifest in social media, being a valuable asset

  Imposed U-Net","The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major
outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe
impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of mid-July 2020,
more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were
reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the
time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a
segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected
by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to
detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to
form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a
suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of
the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is
used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called ""TV-UNet"".
Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation
dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term
leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net
model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the
predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation
performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great

unprecedented challenge to the world's medical resources and prevention and
control measures. Covid-19 attacks not only the lungs, making it difficult to
breathe and life-threatening, but also the heart, kidneys, brain and other
vital organs of the body, with possible sequela. At present, the detection of
COVID-19 needs to be realized by the reverse transcription-polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR). However, many countries are in the outbreak period of the
epidemic, and the medical resources are very limited. They cannot provide
sufficient numbers of gene sequence detection, and many patients may not be
isolated and treated in time. Given this situation, we researched the
analytical and diagnostic capabilities of deep learning on chest radiographs
and proposed Cascade-SEMEnet which is cascaded with SEME-ResNet50 and
SEME-DenseNet169. The two cascade networks of Cascade - SEMEnet both adopt
large input sizes and SE-Structure and use MoEx and histogram equalization to
enhance the data. We first used SEME-ResNet50 to screen chest X-ray and
diagnosed three classes: normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia. Then we used
SEME-DenseNet169 for fine-grained classification of viral pneumonia and
determined if it is caused by COVID-19. To exclude the influence of
non-pathological features on the network, we preprocessed the data with U-Net
during the training of SEME-DenseNet169. The results showed that our network
achieved an accuracy of 85.6\% in determining the type of pneumonia infection
and 97.1\% in the fine-grained classification of COVID-19. We used Grad-CAM to
visualize the judgment based on the model and help doctors understand the chest
radiograph while verifying the effectivene.

close and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economic
health. Macroeconomic models that use preexisting epidemic models to calculate
the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for
policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We
develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly considers herd
immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect
externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control
problem where lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either
naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of
lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population: low-risk (ages
20-64) and high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via
optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the
level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns
once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown
significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases
in mortality. Moreover, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission
rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased
infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown
efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and
high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses.
Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd
immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can
reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing
high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.

strategies to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic exploiting network
epidemiological models. Specifically, by studying a variational equation for
the dynamics of the infected in a network model of the epidemic spread, we
derive, using contractivity arguments, a condition that can be used to
guarantee that, in epidemiological terms, the effective reproduction number is
less than unity. This condition has three advantages: (i) it is easily
computable; (ii) it is directly related to the model parameters; (iii) it can
be used to enforce a scalability condition that prohibits the amplification of
disturbances within the network system. We then include satisfaction of such a
condition as a constraint in a Model Predictive Control problem so as to
mitigate (or suppress) the spread of the epidemic while minimizing the economic
impact of the interventions. A data-driven model of Italy as a network of three
macro-regions (North, Center, and South), whose parameters are identified from
real data, is used to illustrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
control strategy.

suffering from mental health issues and substance use problems. This has been
exacerbated by social isolation during the pandemic and the social stigma

reluctant to share their struggles and seek help. Due to the anonymity and
privacy they provide, social media emerged as a convenient medium for people to
share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a
well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured
forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences
with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social
media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus
is crucial to better understand public sentiment on the pandemic and its

decreased power sector CO$_2$ emissions worldwide. We analyze the statistical
significance of CO$_2$ emissions reductions in the U.S power sector from March
through July 2020 and we present model-informed expectations of the likelihood
of sustained reductions in CO$_2$ emissions. We use Gaussian process (GP)
regression to assess whether CO$_2$ emissions reductions would have occurred
with reasonable probability in the absence of COVID-19 considering uncertainty
due to factors unrelated to the pandemic. We show that CO$_2$ emissions are
lower than levels expected in the absence of COVID-19 for each month from March
through July 2020 but that those monthly reductions are not statistically
significant considering hypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. To make
predictions about whether COVID-19-related CO$_2$ emissions reductions will be
sustained in the power sector, we assess the relative impacts of the pandemic
on electricity generation (E) and on the carbon intensity of electricity supply
(C/E). E is on average 2.9\% lower than what we would expect in the absence of
COVID-19 from March through July 2020. We expect E to rebound alongside a
recovery of the U.S. economy. C/E is determined to be 2.7% lower on average
than what we would expect in the absence of COVID-19 from March through July
2020. Reductions in C/E are mostly attributable to reductions in the share of
coal-fired electricity generation. We analyze the expected profitability
through 2021 of the 845 coal-fired power plant units operating in the U.S. We
find that only 76 of those units, representing 1.3% of total coal generation
capacity, were expected to be profitable prior to COVID-19 but are no longer
expected to be profitable. We conclude that COVID-19 is unlikely to have a
material impact on U.S. power sector CO$_2$ emissions in the long-run.

  of Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone","Social-distancing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread
reductions in air pollutant emissions. Quantifying these changes requires a
business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal
variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by
information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide
(NO$_{2}$) and ozone (O$_{3}$) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from
January through June 2020. Reductions in NO$_{2}$ correlate with timing and
intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected
cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On
average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from
February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but
concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the
business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been
more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that
the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months
of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic
total. The response of surface O$_{3}$ is complicated by competing influences
of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O$_{3}$ increased by up to
50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O$_{3}$
between February - June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a
flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone
due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a
reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on
season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O$_{3}$
forecasted if NO$_{x}$ emission reductions continue.

results are examined in the form of graphs and statistical analyses. The
results show that the Bi-directional models have lower error than other models.
Several error evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and
finally, the superiority of Bi-directional methods are determined. The
experimental results and statistical test show on datasets to compare the

crowdsourced audio samples from Latin America and clinical samples from South
Asia, without further training using the specific samples from those regions.
As more crowdsourced data is collected, further development can be implemented
using various respiratory audio samples to create a cough analysis-based
machine learning (ML) solution for COVID-19 detection that can likely
generalize globally to all demographic groups in both clinical and non-clinical
settings.

wears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial
recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access
control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at
train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition
performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces.
Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep
learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present,
there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end,
this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face
Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD)
and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best
of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face
dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on
which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The
multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95%
accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are
available at: https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset.

  model-based predictions with large under-reporting","The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defying global health crisis
of our time. The absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of
asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic in
Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected
individuals and deaths. We propose an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model which explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response
of the population to public policies (such as confinement measures, widespread
use of masks, etc) to cast short-term and long-term predictions. Large amounts
of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions. In this paper,
we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction, which is illustrated
regarding three key aspects. First, assuming that the number of infected
individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the
peak of infection. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected
individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both
symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the
peak of symptomatic. Second, considering that the actual amount of deaths is
larger than what is being register, then demonstrate the increase of the
mortality rates. Third, when consider generally under-reported data, we
demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change
qualitatively and quantitatively. We also investigate the effect of the
""COVID-19 under-reporting tripod"", i.e. the under-reporting in terms of
infected individuals, of deaths and the true mortality rate. If two of these
factors are known, the remainder can be inferred, as long as proportions are
kept constant. The proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of
uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates.

  Pandemic Game","A key challenge in responding to public health crises such as COVID-19 is the
difficulty of predicting the results of feedback interconnections between the
disease and society. As a step towards understanding these interconnections, we
pose a simple game-theoretic model of a global pandemic in which individuals
can choose where to live, and we investigate the global behavior that may
emerge as a result of individuals reacting locally to the competing costs of
isolation and infection. We study the game-theoretic equilibria that emerge
from this setup when the population is composed of either selfish or altruistic
individuals. First, we demonstrate that as is typical in these types of games,
selfish equilibria are in general not optimal, but that all stable selfish
equilibria are within a constant factor of optimal. Second, there exist
infinitely-many stable altruistic equilibria; all but finitely-many of these
are worse than the worst selfish equilibrium, and the social cost of altruistic
equilibria is unbounded. Our work is in sharp contrast to recent work in
network congestion games in which all altruistic equilibria are socially
optimal. This suggests that a population without central coordination may react
very poorly to a pandemic, and that individual altruism could even exacerbate
the problem.

on Twitter before and during COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed by 109
countries. We find that the media sharing behavior differs widely between
countries, in some having immediate response to the lockdown decrees - mostly
by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a
substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with
mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media
sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated
lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media
sharing volume data available to the research community for continued

  the spike glycoprotein with heparin","Heparin is administered intravenously as an anticoagulant to COVID-19
patients and via aerosol to treat other lung diseases. It has recently been
found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as it hinders attachment of
the virus to the host cell by binding to the virus spike glycoprotein. Here, we
describe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how heparin binds to the
spike and the mechanism by which it exerts its antiviral activity. The
simulations show that heparin polyanionic chains can bind at long, mostly
positively charged patches on the spike, preventing the binding of host cell
heparan sulphate proteoglycans to the spike. Heparin can mask both the S1/S2
basic motif, thereby inhibiting furin cleavage and the formation of the
prefusion conformation, and the basic residues of the receptor binding domain
(RBD), thus acting on the hinge region responsible for the motion of the RBD
between inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike. In
simulations of the closed spike, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal
domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders the opening. In simulations
of the open spike, heparin binds similarly but induces stabilization of the
hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Heparin is therefore able to inhibit
host cell attachment directly and by two allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore,
the simulations provide insights into how heparan sulphate proteoglycans on the
host cell can facilitate viral infection. Our results will aid the rational
optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy.

as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with
the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across
organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form,
for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the
outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to
reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social
distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with
demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions,
robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before

government administration around the globe. When faced with diseases of this
severity, it is useful for the authorities to have prediction tools to estimate
in advance the impact on the health system and the human, material, and
economic resources that will be necessary. In this paper, we construct an
extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model that incorporates the
social structure of Mar del Plata, the $4^\circ$ most inhabited city in
Argentina and head of the Municipality of General Pueyrred\'on. Moreover, we
consider detailed partitions of infected individuals according to the illness
severity, as well as data of local health resources, to bring these predictions
closer to the local reality. Tuning the corresponding epidemic parameters for
COVID-19, we study an alternating quarantine strategy, in which a part of the
population can circulate without restrictions at any time, while the rest is
equally divided into two groups and goes on successive periods of normal
activity and lockdown, each one with a duration of $\tau$ days. Besides, we
implement a random testing strategy over the population. We found that $\tau =
7$ is a good choice for the quarantine strategy since it matches with the
weekly cycle as it reduces the infected population. Focusing on the health
system, projecting from the situation as of September 30, we foresee a
difficulty to avoid saturation of ICU, given the extremely low levels of
mobility that would be required. In the worst case, our model estimates that
four thousand deaths would occur, of which 30\% could be avoided with proper
medical attention. Nonetheless, we found that aggressive testing would allow an
increase in the percentage of people that can circulate without restrictions,
being the equipment required to deal with the additional critical patients

report that summarizes grant funding priorities, observatory & instrumental
priorities as well as community accomplishments and community goals such as
increasing the number of women and the number of people from underrepresented
groups. In the 2010 US National Academies Decadal Survey of Astronomy (National
Research Council, 2010), it was suggested that having to move so frequently
which is a career necessity may be unattractive to people wanting to start a
family, especially impacting women. Whether in Europe or elsewhere, as
postdocs, astrophysicists will relocate every two to three years, until they
secure a permanent position or leave research altogether. Astrophysicists do
perceive working abroad as important and positive for their careers (Parenti,
2002); however, it was found that the men at equal rank had not had to spend as
much time abroad to further their careers (Fohlmeister & Helling, 2012). By
implication, women need to work abroad longer or have more positions abroad to
achieve the same rank as men. Astrophysicists living in the United Kingdom
prefer to work in their country of origin, but many did not do so because of
worse working conditions or difficultly finding a job for their spouse
(Fohlmeister & Helling, 2014). In sum, mobility and moving is necessary for a
career in astrophysics, and even more necessary for women, but astrophysicists
prefer not to move as frequently as needed to maintain a research career. To
gather more data on these issues and to broaden the discourse beyond
male/female to include the gender diverse as well as to include other forms of
diversity, I designed the ASTROMOVES project which is funded through a Marie
Curie Individual Fellowship. Though slowed down by COVID-19, several interviews
have been conducted and some preliminary results will be presented.

  regions and provinces: an analysis of environmental, demographic, and
  healthcare factors","The Italian government has been one of the most responsive to COVID-19
emergency, through the adoption of quick and increasingly stringent measures to
contain the outbreak. Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social
cost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to
investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across
Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression
approach; and ii) second, to build a taxonomy of provinces with similar
mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward hierarchical agglomerative
clustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution,
climatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that
represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health
care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce
the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density,
level of air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity,
COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were
positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical
integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular,
the risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a
three-fold greater risk than the 80 to 89 years old and four-fold greater risk
than 70 to 79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest
mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest
risk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and
health system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining
the CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by
the massive stress of the Italian health system.

  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?","As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.

sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in
the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives
and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents

A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in

its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution
for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and
positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms
can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and
other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application
scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The
inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing
sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably
low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain
on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address
these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for
correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is
implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.
Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling

the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily

The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and

to understand a nation's economy. They represent the economy as a collection of

models make it difficult to include the important effects of heterogeneous

of heterogeneity, for example in age and sector of employment, in macroeconomic
outcomes and the need for models that can more easily incorporate it. We use
techniques from reinforcement learning to solve such models incorporating
heterogeneous agents in a way that is simple, extensible, and computationally
efficient. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and stability on a toy problem

  Remote Learning","In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational activities had to be done
remotely as a way to avoid the spread of the disease. What happened was not
exactly a shift to an online learning model but a transition to a new approach
called Emergency Remote Teaching. It is a temporary strategy to keep activities
going on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of
universities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and
students. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles
for students to continue engaged. Before the pandemic, hackathons --
short-lived events (1 to 3 days) where participants intensively collaboration
to develop software prototypes -- were starting to be explored as an
alternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical
skills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an
online hackathon as a resource to engage students in the development of their
semester project in a distributed applications course during this emergency
remote teaching period. We describe details of the intervention and present an
analysis of the students' perspective of the approach. One of the important
findings was the efficient usage of the Discord communication tool -- already
used by all students while playing games -- which helped them socialize and
keep them continuously engaged in synchronous group work, ""virtually
collocated"".

services, and it has affected the care programs for non-COVID patients. The
objective was to develop a mathematical model designed to optimize predictions
related to the need for hospitalization and ICU admission by COVID-19 patients.
  Design. Prospective study. Setting. Province of Granada (Spain). Population.
Consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized, admitted to ICU, recovered and died
from March 15 to September 22, 2020. Study variables. The number of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized or admitted to ICU for COVID-19.
  Results. The data reported by hospitals was used to develop a mathematical
model that reflects the flow of the population among the different interest
groups in relation to COVID-19. This tool has allowed us to analyse different
scenarios based on socio-health restriction measures, and to forecast the
number of people infected, hospitalized and admitted to the ICU until May 2021.
  Conclusions. The mathematical model is capable of providing predictions on
the evolution of the COVID-19 sufficiently in advance as to anticipate the
peaks of prevalence and hospital and ICU care demands, and also the appearance
of periods in which the care for non-COVID patients could be intensified.

(Coronavirus disease) implications address droplets' dynamics in quiescent
environments. As most droplets in a common situation are immersed in external
flows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow
profiles namely, shear flow, Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the
transport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5$\mu$m to 100 $\mu $m,
which are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing
processes. The dynamics we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An
order-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve the M-R equation to leading
order analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset
memory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order
indicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5\mu m$
radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of
$1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in
the air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also
calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a
small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it
depends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets
of radius $5\mu m$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is
seen to be around $2m$. In general, higher order terms are observed to slightly
enhance droplets' dispersion and their flying time.

  Pathways in Hospitals","Pathogen outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks of bacteria and viruses) in hospitals can
cause high mortality rates and increase costs for hospitals significantly. An
outbreak is generally noticed when the number of infected patients rises above
an endemic level or the usual prevalence of a pathogen in a defined population.
Reconstructing transmission pathways back to the source of an outbreak -- the
patient zero or index patient -- requires the analysis of microbiological data
and patient contacts. This is often manually completed by infection control
experts. We present a novel visual analytics approach to support the analysis
of transmission pathways, patient contacts, the progression of the outbreak,
and patient timelines during hospitalization. Infection control experts applied
our solution to a real outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a large German
hospital. Using our system, our experts were able to scale the analysis of
transmission pathways to longer time intervals (i.e., several years of data
instead of days) and across a larger number of wards. Also, the system is able
to reduce the analysis time from days to hours. In our final study, feedback
from twenty-five experts from seven German hospitals provides evidence that our
solution brings significant benefits for analyzing outbreaks. It is also
applicable to COVID-19 hospital-associated transmissions.

epidemic spreading. We compare different partition strategies, with a twofold
aim: reducing the epidemic outbreak and minimizing the economic cost associated

different kinds of restrictions on social interactions help in keeping the
benefices of the network partition.

COVID-19 growth curves in different cities, which remain inadequately explained
by standard epidemiological models, is critical for medical supply and
treatment. Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions
to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social
distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in
intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating
coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to
consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by
incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel
metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth
patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to
policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple
Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of
model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban
""superspreading"", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary
infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and
heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can
facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively
mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate
our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that
informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies.

  Model of COVID-19 Hospital Trajectories","We address the problem of modeling constrained hospital resources in the
midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-makers of future
demand and assess the societal value of possible interventions. For broad
applicability, we focus on the common yet challenging scenario where
patient-level data for a region of interest are not available. Instead, given
daily admissions counts, we model aggregated counts of observed resource use,
such as the number of patients in the general ward, in the intensive care unit,
or on a ventilator. In order to explain how individual patient trajectories
produce these counts, we propose an aggregate count explicit-duration hidden
Markov model, nicknamed the ACED-HMM, with an interpretable, compact
parameterization. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach that
draws samples from the posterior distribution over the model's transition and
duration parameters given aggregate counts from a specific location, thus
adapting the model to a region or individual hospital site of interest. Samples
from this posterior can then be used to produce future forecasts of any counts
of interest. Using data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show
our mechanistic approach provides competitive probabilistic forecasts for the
future even as the dynamics of the pandemic shift. Furthermore, we show how our
model provides insight about recovery probabilities or length of stay
distributions, and we suggest its potential to answer challenging what-if
questions about the societal value of possible interventions.

  of COVID-19 in India","In this paper we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19.
The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in
a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not
infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of
dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level.
The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include
testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide
lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the
context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration
or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the
metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on
this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with
COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states,
prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters
are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while
training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the
present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of
testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be
contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by
certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also
necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid
of the second wave of pandemic.

  Risk of COVID-19 in the United States","The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the United States has imposed a major threat
to public health, the real economy, and human well-being. With the absence of
effective vaccines, the preventive actions of social distancing and travel
reduction are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches to control
the spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and
mobility drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is
known, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction on
cross-county transmission risk of COVID-19. This study utilizes Facebook
co-location data for all counties in the United States from March to early May
2020. The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travel
reduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social
distancing in ceasing the population co-location probabilities, and
subsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that the
mitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new
cases with one week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is found
among different county groups which are categorized based on numbers of cases.
The results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities remain stable,
and social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group
co-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with large
number of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings could
have important practical implications for local governments to inform their
intervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as
well as for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting,
and epidemic modeling need to account for population co-location patterns in
evaluating transmission risk of COVID-19 across counties.

COVID-19 crisis. Some of those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons
from mobile devices to build a record of proximate encounters between a pair of
device owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false positive
and re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's
difficulty in mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker
leveraging a moderately successful app or SDK with Bluetooth and location
access can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing systems at no
hardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app
or SDK installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a
good position to execute such attacks. We further present a novel attack, which
we call a biosurveillance attack, which allows the attacker to monitor the
exposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who does
not use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted
out of the system.
  Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize
precisely the behaviour of one such SDK that we found in a handful of
apps---but installed on more than one hundred million mobile devices. Its
behaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or
biosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with
minimal effort. We also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position
conducive to such attacks, by leveraging the lax logic for granting permissions

could acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without
any additional user prompt. Finally we discuss motives for conducting such

the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also
designed a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction.
STAN was tested using both massive real-world patient data and open source
COVID-19 statistics provided by Johns Hopkins university across all U.S.
counties. Results: STAN outperforms epidemiological modeling methods such as
SIR and SEIR and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term
predictions, achieving up to 87% lower mean squared error compared to the best
baseline prediction model. Conclusions: By using information from real-world
patient data and geographical data, STAN can better capture the disease status
and medical resource utilization information and thus provides more accurate
pandemic modeling. With pandemic transmission law based regularization, STAN
also achieves good long-term prediction performance.

air for a few hours. It is highly possible that people get infected with the
disease by breathing and contact with items contaminated by the aerosolised
virus. However, the aerosolised virus transmission and trajectories in various
meteorological environments remain unclear. This paper has investigated the
movement of aerosolised viruses from a high concentration source across a dense
urban area. The case study looks at the highly air polluted areas of London:
University College Hospital (UCH) and King Cross and St Pancras International
Station (KCSPI). We explored the spread and decay of COVID-19 released from the
hospital and railway stations with the prescribed meteorological conditions.
The study has three key findings: the primary result is that it is possible for
the virus to travel from meters up to hundred meters from the source location.
The secondary finding shows viruses released into the atmosphere from entry and
exit points at KCSPI remain trapped within a small radial distance of < 50m.
This strengthens the case for the use of face coverings to reduce the infection
rate. The final finding shows that there are different levels of risk at
various door locations for UCH, depending on which door is used there can be a
higher concentration of COVID-19. Although our results are based on London,
since the fundamental knowledge processes are the same, our study can be
further extended to other locations (especially the highly air polluted areas)
in the world.

reported on January 21, 2020. By the end of March, 2020, there were more than
180000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties.
We find that the right tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with
Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the
growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of
this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of
confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had
been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power
law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated
directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of
March.

  COVID-19 epidemic, not herd immunity","Epidemics generally spread through a succession of waves that reflect factors
on multiple timescales. On short timescales, super-spreading events lead to
burstiness and overdispersion, while long-term persistent heterogeneity in
susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in the infection peak and the
herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass
both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and
demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of
epidemiological models through parameterization. We derive a non-linear
dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible
population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity
(TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the
epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing
levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of
herd immunity: subsequent waves can and will emerge due to behavioral changes
in the population, driven (e.g.) by seasonal factors. Transient and long-term
levels of heterogeneity are estimated by using empirical data from the COVID-19
epidemic as well as from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results
suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have achieved TCI following
the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT.
Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience
subsequent waves.

and possibly limit the impact of future waves. Still, since a reliable and
consistent method to measure the evolution of contagion at international level
is missing, a systematic analysis of the relationship between human mobility
and virus spread has never been conducted. A notable exceptions are France and
Italy, for which data on excess deaths, an indirect indicator which is
generally considered to be less affected by national and regional assumptions,
are available at department and municipality level, respectively. Using this
information together with anonymised and aggregated mobile data, this study
shows that mobility alone can explain up to 92% of the initial spread in these
two EU countries, while it has a slow decay effect after lockdown measures,
meaning that mobility restrictions seem to have effectively contribute to save
lives. It also emerges that internal mobility is more important than mobility
across provinces and that the typical lagged positive effect of reduced human
mobility on reducing excess deaths is around 14-20 days. An analogous analysis
relative to Spain, for which an IgG SARS-Cov-2 antibody screening study at
province level is used instead of excess deaths statistics, confirms the
findings. The same approach adopted in this study can be easily extended to
other European countries, as soon as reliable data on the spreading of the
virus at a suitable level of granularity will be available. Looking at past
data, relative to the initial phase of the outbreak in EU Member States, this
study shows in which extent the spreading of the virus and human mobility are
connected.

  and its Clinical Applications in COVID-19","In recent years, deep learning-based image analysis methods have been widely
applied in computer-aided detection, diagnosis and prognosis, and has shown its
value during the public health crisis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in
COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the
United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image
retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated
clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image
diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model
based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims
at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims
at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same
labels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity
loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the
optimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The
model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset
collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image
retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a
robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model
is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support
task, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a
new dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep
metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR
retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the
treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.

diagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection
measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on
radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data
systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we
explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a
single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological
images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called
CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given
condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our
CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of
COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution
radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep
classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from
CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results
are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely
small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data
augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset
(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the
performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on
large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19
diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

framework for understanding the uneven (cross-country) spread of COVID-19 in

system of tourism mobility is modeled as a complex network, where two main
stages in the temporal spread of COVID-19 are revealed and defined by the
cutting-point of the 44th day from Wuhan. The first stage describes the
outbreak in Asia and North America, the second one in Europe, South America,
and Africa, while the outbreak in Oceania is spread along both stages. The
analysis shows that highly connected nodes in the global tourism network (GTN)
are infected early by the pandemic, while nodes of lower connectivity are late
infected. Moreover, countries with the same network centrality as China were
early infected on average by COVID-19. The paper also finds that network
interconnectedness, economic openness, and transport integration are key
determinants in the early global spread of the pandemic, and it reveals that

  Use of Controversial Terms for COVID-19","With the world-wide development of 2019 novel coronavirus, although WHO has
officially announced the disease as COVID-19, one controversial term - ""Chinese
Virus"" is still being used by a great number of people. In the meantime, global
online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily,
most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes
increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media
platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two
ways: using controversial terms like ""Chinese Virus"" or ""Wuhan Virus"", or using
non-controversial terms like ""Coronavirus"". In this study, we attempt to
characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use
non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related
tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences
between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level
features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as
their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict
Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best
knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to
characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a
major crisis.

  detect survival chance of COVID 19 patients","In this paper, we propose a novel method named CNN-AE to predict survival
chance of COVID-19 patients using a CNN trained on clinical information. To
further increase the prediction accuracy, we use the CNN in combination with an
autoencoder. Our method is one of the first that aims to predict survival
chance of already infected patients. We rely on clinical data to carry out the
prediction. The motivation is that the required resources to prepare CT images
are expensive and limited compared to the resources required to collect
clinical data such as blood pressure, liver disease, etc. We evaluate our
method on a publicly available clinical dataset of deceased and recovered
patients which we have collected. Careful analysis of the dataset properties is
also presented which consists of important features extraction and correlation
computation between features. Since most of COVID-19 patients are usually
recovered, the number of deceased samples of our dataset is low leading to data
imbalance. To remedy this issue, a data augmentation procedure based on
autoencoders is proposed. To demonstrate the generality of our augmentation
method, we train random forest and Na\""ive Bayes on our dataset with and
without augmentation and compare their performance. We also evaluate our method
on another dataset for further generality verification. Experimental results
reveal the superiority of CNN-AE method compared to the standard CNN as well as
other methods such as random forest and Na\""ive Bayes. COVID-19 detection
average accuracy of CNN-AE is 96.05% which is higher than CNN average accuracy
of 92.49%. To show that clinical data can be used as a reliable dataset for
COVID-19 survival chance prediction, CNN-AE is compared with a standard CNN
which is trained on CT images.

particularly when the epidemic models are developed based on certain
simplifications of reality, also known as imperfect models which are commonly

person-to-person interaction as much as possible. This was implemented by the
temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social
distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and
the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model

nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote
family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential

in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Trump administration sought
to shift blame by scapegoating outgroups (by using the term ""Chinese virus""),
and framing performance information on COVID-19 testing in positive terms.
Using a novel pre-registered survey experiment that incorporates open and
close-ended items, we offer three main findings. First, there is clear evidence
of motivated reasoning: conservatives rate the performance of the Trump
administration more positively and are more apt to blame prominent Democrats,
Chinese residents and the Chinese Government. Second, performance information
framing was found to impact blame attribution among conservatives, but only for
open-ended responses. Third, while exposure to the term ""Chinese virus""
increased blame assigned to Chinese residents among all participants,
conservatives exposed to the term appeared to blame President Trump more,
suggesting repeated use of divisive blame shifting strategies may alienate even

affected. (3) Surprisingly, workers whose children are primary school pupils

Due to school closure and a lack of after-school care, parents need to work
from home, and this experience motivated workers with small children to
continue doing so to improve work-life balance even after schools reopen.

happens after the design or even deployment, meaning the security community is
routinely playing catch-up and attempting to patch vulnerabilities that could
be exploited any minute. While security measures such as encryption and
authentication have been widely adopted, questions of security tend to be
secondary to application capability. There needs to be a sea-change in the way
we approach this critically important aspect of the problem: new incentives and
education are at the core of this change. Now is the time to refocus research
community efforts on developing interconnected technologies with security

the performance of the semi-supervised deep learning architecture known as

home advantage, using the results of these closed matches. The proposed
analysis uses pairwise comparison method to reduce the effects caused by the
unbalanced schedule. The following conclusions were drawn from the statistical
hypothesis tests conducted in this study: In four major European leagues, the
home advantage is reduced in closed matches compared to than in the normal
situation, i.e., with spectators. The reduction amounts among leagues were
different. For example, in Germany, the home advantage was negative during the
closed-match period. On the other hand,in England,statistically significant
differences in home advantage were not observed between closed matches and
normal situation.

the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, we present an optimization framework
for identifying routes through a grocery store that eliminate or minimize
contacts between customers at grocery stock points while also minimizing the
time spent within the store. We develop a discrete-event simulation of the
customer arrival process, and simulate the arrival of customers with varying
shopping list sizes and movement patterns. We then present two optimization
formulations for generating optimal shopping routes on a real-time basis for
each customer arriving to the store given the route information of other
customers already present in the store. The first formulation eliminates
contacts between customers whereas the second minimizes contacts between
customers. Both formulations are mixed-integer problems based on extensions to
the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation of the traveling salesman problem. We also
explore an alternate scenario for the deployment of these formulations wherein
the customers and the store can plan visits ahead of time. This framework can
be applied to more general contexts wherein minimizing contacts between
randomly arriving agents needing to visit a subset of nodes in a connected
network is required.

considered in Cohen[2]. They are not subject to correction but they are
reported for readers' consideration. However, they made an analysis for the
incidence based on Fisher's hypothesis test for means while they published
detailed time dependent data which were not analyzed, disregarding an important
information. Here we make the analyses with this time dependent data adopting a
simple regression analysis.
  We conclude their randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial presents
statistical evidence, at 99% confidence level, that the treatment of Covid-19
patients with hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the appearance of
symptoms if used before or right after exposure to the virus. For 0 to 2 days
after exposure to virus, the estimated relative reduction in symptomatic
outcomes is 72% after 0 days, 48.9% after 1 day and 29.3% after 2 days. For 3
days after exposure, the estimated relative reduction is 15.7% but results are
not statistically conclusive and for 4 or more days after exposure there is no
statistical evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the
appearance of symptoms.
  Our results show that the time elapsed between infection and the beginning of
treatment is crucial for the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment to

transparent tracing of COVID-19 vaccine registration, storage and delivery, and
side effects self-reporting. We present such system implementation in which
blockchain technology is used for assuring data integrity and immutability in
case of beneficiary registration for vaccination, eliminating identity thefts
and impersonations. Smart contracts are defined to monitor and track the proper
vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by
vaccine producers enabling the awareness of all network peers. For vaccine
administration, a transparent and tamper-proof side effects self-reporting
solution is provided considering person identification and administrated
vaccine association. A prototype was implemented using the Ethereum test
network, Ropsten, considering the COVID-19 vaccine distribution tracking
conditions. The results obtained for each on-chain operation can be checked and
validated on the Etherscan, demonstrating various aspects of the proposed
system such as immunization actors and safe rules registration, vaccine

detecting COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test kits. Similar to the Tapestry scheme
of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the
RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to
conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The
proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used
Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and
specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number
of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling
schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes
can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and
are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in
the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a
population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a

identify the key parameters of the COVID-19 transmission network for time
periods before, during, and after the application of strict NPIs for the first
wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany combining Bayesian parameter inference
with an agent-based epidemiological model. We assume a Watts-Strogatz
small-world network which allows to distinguish contacts within clustered
cliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which have been
shown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works,
which use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell
phone data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show
that NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network,
increased network clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a
constant regime of newcases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave
with a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear
fashion, which we can predict by mean field theory. Our analysis indicates that
besides the well-known transitionbetween exponential increase and exponential
decrease in the number of new cases, NPIs can induce a transition to another,
previously unappreciated regime of constant new cases.

phenomenon where a certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates
the movement of leading time-series. The present research proposes a new
technique which helps better identify the lead-lag relationship empirically.
Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a
measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the
proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic
Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it
retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose

relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the

best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically
significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use

spatial interactions among locations. For decades, spatial scientists have
researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing
popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social
interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable,
and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place
connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by
geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement

that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the
distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a
denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great
potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity
knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of
COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and 2) modeling hurricane
evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of

  be precisely forecast?","No, they can't. Epidemic spread is characterized by exponentially growing
dynamics, which are intrinsically unpredictable. The time at which the growth
in the number of infected individuals halts and starts decreasing cannot be
calculated with certainty before the turning point is actually attained;
neither can the end of the epidemic after the turning point. An SIR model with
confinement (SCIR) illustrates how lockdown measures inhibit infection spread
only above a threshold that we calculate. The existence of that threshold has
major effects in predictability: A Bayesian fit to the COVID-19 pandemic in
Spain shows that a slow-down in the number of newly infected individuals during
the expansion phase allows to infer neither the precise position of the maximum
nor whether the measures taken will bring the propagation to the inhibition
regime. There is a short horizon for reliable prediction, followed by a
dispersion of the possible trajectories that grows extremely fast. The
impossibility to predict in the mid-term is not due to wrong or incomplete
data, since it persists in error-free, synthetically produced data sets, and
does not necessarily improve by using larger data sets. Our study warns against
precise forecasts of the evolution of epidemics based on mean-field, effective
or phenomenological models, and supports that only probabilities of different

described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication
channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is
being applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination
it had been intended for. Since literally every other potential participant
only listens to random data, even a brute force attack will not succeed.
WeTrace and its Open Source implementation is the only known approach so far,
which ensures that any receiver of a message knows that this is for him/her,
but does not know who the original sender was.

  relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic","In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of spherical droplets in the
presence of a source-sink pair flow field. The dynamics of the droplets is
governed by the Maxey-Riley equation with Basset-Boussinesq history term
neglected. We find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct
behaviours for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further than a specific
distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting
pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before
getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their
maximum travelled distance is determined analytically.
  We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three
distinct droplet behaviours categorised by their relative sizes: small,
intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets
with minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate
size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration,
these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few $\mu$m to a few
hundred $\mu$m. The result that such droplets have a very short range could
have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet
dispersion.

March 2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented
decline in anthropogenic activities and in turn improvements in ambient air
quality. This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical
speciation and source apportionment of PM$_{2.5}$ to assess the impact of the
lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ in
Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM$_{2.5}$
were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report
source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of
organic and elemental fractions of PM$_{2.5}$ during the different phases of
the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal
combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to
decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as
compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O$_3$ concentrations with
declining NO$_x$ levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe,
leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to
almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the
lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other
resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related,
hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions,
which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the
four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for
future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which
constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air.

approach to capture inflows/outflows of people as a result of the pandemic and
changes in mobility behavior for those that remain. First, we develop a

measure and analyze disparities in community social distancing by identifying
patterns in neighborhood activity levels and characteristics before and after
the stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effect of social distancing in
neighborhoods on COVID-19 infection rates and outcomes associated with
localized demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructure characteristics in
order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our
findings provide insight into the timely evaluation of the effectiveness of
social distancing for individual neighborhoods and support a more equitable
allocation of resources to support vulnerable and at-risk communities. Our
findings demonstrate distinct patterns of activity pre- and post-COVID across

  measures and lower his/her turnover intention","An important theme is how to maximize the cooperation of employees when
dealing with crisis measures taken by the company. Therefore, to find out what
kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current
corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass
analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire
survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results
showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more
supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were
more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it
was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona
countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just
by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term
goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against
corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their
intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and
to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company
to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the
company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.

COVID-19 have resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic characterized by time

that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical

critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single
infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic,
however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a
number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such
non-trivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model.
We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model.
We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the
initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the
outbreak is a non-monotonic function of the initial number of infected
individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations
associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics

much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing

transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only
relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective
Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search
mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and
maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely
Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility.
The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to
generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a
well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation
between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two
exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it
get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD
dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low
level while retaining 76\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is

example, the production of face representation network desires a modular

state-of-the-art backbone and training supervision subject to the real-world
face recognition demand; for performance analysis and comparison, the standard

practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an

infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction
number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the
transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic,
is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading
events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity
under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission
dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor
settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care
facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family
gatherings, parties and night clubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to
understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity that outbreak
can be effectively contained with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs.

  the effects of anti-inflammatory intervention","Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that can contribute to the
cytokine storm associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is central to pyroptosis,
which may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be
inhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a
single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3
inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory
intervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is
formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that
describe the dynamics of the biological components involved in pyroptosis. Our
results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation of
the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from
inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell
model is being implemented in a SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator, in collaboration
with a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics of
COVID-19. In this paper, we provide an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 Tissue
Simulator and highlight the effects of pyroptosis on a cellular level.

  in Machine Learning and Deep Learning","Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically overwhelmed more than 200
countries affecting millions and claiming almost 1 million lives, since its
emergence in late 2019. This highly contagious disease can easily spread, and
if not controlled in a timely fashion, can rapidly incapacitate healthcare
systems. The current standard diagnosis method, the Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR), is time consuming, and subject to low
sensitivity. Chest Radiograph (CXR), the first imaging modality to be used, is
readily available and gives immediate results. However, it has notoriously
lower sensitivity than Computed Tomography (CT), which can be used efficiently
to complement other diagnostic methods. This paper introduces a new COVID-19 CT
scan dataset, referred to as COVID-CT-MD, consisting of not only COVID-19
cases, but also healthy and subjects infected by Community Acquired Pneumonia
(CAP). COVID-CT-MD dataset, which is accompanied with lobe-level, slice-level

  COVID-19 Using Chest X-Ray Images","With a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case count exceeding 10 million
worldwide, there is an increased need for a diagnostic capability. The main
variables in increasing diagnostic capability are reduced cost, turnaround or
diagnosis time, and upfront equipment cost and accessibility. Two candidates
for machine learning COVID-19 diagnosis are Computed Tomography (CT) scans and
plain chest X-rays. While CT scans score higher in sensitivity, they have a
higher cost, maintenance requirement, and turnaround time as compared to plain
chest X-rays. The use of portable chest X-radiograph (CXR) is recommended by
the American College of Radiology (ACR) since using CT places a massive burden
on radiology services. Therefore, X-ray imagery paired with machine learning
techniques is proposed a first-line triage tool for COVID-19 diagnostics. In
this paper we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to accurately classify
chest X-ray scans of COVID-19 and normal subjects by fine-tuning several neural
networks (ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet201) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
These neural networks are fused in a parallel architecture and the voting
criteria are applied in the final classification decision between the candidate
object classes where the output of each neural network is representing a single
vote. Several experiments are conducted on the weakly labeled COVID-19-CT-CXR

against misinformation.While fact checking is important and its impact has been
significant, fact checks could have limited visibility and may not reach the
intended audience, such as those deeply embedded in polarized communities.
Concerned citizens (i.e., the crowd), who are users of the platforms where
misinformation appears, can play a crucial role in disseminating fact-checking
information and in countering the spread of misinformation. To explore if this
is the case, we conduct a data-driven study of misinformation on the Twitter
platform, focusing on tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the
spread of misinformation, professional fact checks, and the crowd response to
popular misleading claims about COVID-19. In this work, we curate a dataset of
false claims and statements that seek to challenge or refute them. We train a
classifier to create a novel dataset of 155,468 COVID-19-related tweets,
containing 33,237 false claims and 33,413 refuting arguments.Our findings show
that professional fact-checking tweets have limited volume and reach. In
contrast, we observe that the surge in misinformation tweets results in a quick
response and a corresponding increase in tweets that refute such
misinformation. More importantly, we find contrasting differences in the way
the crowd refutes tweets, some tweets appear to be opinions, while others
contain concrete evidence, such as a link to a reputed source. Our work
provides insights into how misinformation is organically countered in social
platforms by some of their users and the role they play in amplifying

spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g.,
mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We
apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding

imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice- and

representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for
the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal

addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M 3
Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any

we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of

down the economy while staying within the capacity of the healthcare system. We
base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which
takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease,
including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the
intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number
of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model
parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and
low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care
hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that
countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid
lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds
per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total
number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to
specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case
of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback
loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the
death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine
scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the
whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk
group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.

  mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic using global mobility data","The implementation of governmental Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)
has been the primary means of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 disease.
The intended effect of these NPIs has been to reduce mobility. A strong
reduction in mobility is believed to have a positive effect on the reduction of
COVID-19 transmission by limiting the opportunity for the virus to spread in
the population. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is
essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using global mobility
data, released by Apple and Google, and ACAPS NPI data, we investigate the
proportional contribution of NPIs on i) size of the change (magnitude) of
transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) rate
(gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best
fit model we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to
impact the magnitude of the change in mobility were: Lockdown measures (Apple,
Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS)),
declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS), closure of
businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using
cluster analysis and chi square tests we found that closure of businesses and
public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings as well as
border closures and international flight suspensions were closely related. The
implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings had the
greatest effect on the rate of mobility change. In conclusion, we were able to
quantitatively assess the efficacy of NPIs in reducing mobility, which enables
us to understand their fine grained effects in a timely manner and therefore
facilitate well-informed and cost-effective interventions.

distribution, g(\tau), which is usually obtained from empirical data or already
known distributions from the literature. However, there are systems, especially
highly heterogeneous ones, in which there is a lack of data and an adequate
methodology to obtain g(\tau). In this work, we use mathematical models to
bridge this gap. We present a general methodology for obtaining an explicit
expression of the reproduction numbers and the generation interval
distributions provided by an arbitrary compartmental model. Additionally, we
present the appropriate expressions to evaluate those reproduction numbers

  Study of Baidu During COVID-19 Pandemic","Nowadays, working from home (WFH) has become a popular work arrangement due
to its many potential benefits for both companies and employees (e.g.,
increasing job satisfaction and retention of employees). Many previous studies
have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of
employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis
method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work
from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to
work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working
from home affects their productivity.
  In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity
between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative
analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one
of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four
thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of
these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due
to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts
on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of
builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has
different impacts on projects with different characteristics including
programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has
a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally,
we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these
findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some
reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.

  Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Usages among College
  Students in the United States during COVID-19: Observational Study","Mental health problems among the global population are worsened during the
coronavirus disease (COVID-19). How individuals engage with online platforms
such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to pandemic and
subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have
the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations
in mental health profiles in a non-invasive manner. The goal of this study is
to examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating
mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with
Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49
students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic)
and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. This study
followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the
anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google
Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From
individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals
that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then
assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental
health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included
late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the
internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions,
social activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies are required,
our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to
establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that
bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.

  Label-wise Attention Networks and Label Embedding Initialisation","Diagnostic or procedural coding of clinical notes aims to derive a coded
summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually
done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for
automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the
explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used
confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these
models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex
correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve
the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN),
which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention
weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation
and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise
attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings
on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS
COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE
initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN
achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and
comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other
models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label,
HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to
its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models. LE initialisation
consistently boosted most deep learning models for automated medical coding.

between mid-April and mid-June, which unexpectedly corresponds to the time when
many state and national lockdowns were released resulting in surges of new
cases. Several plausible causes for this drop are examined, such as
improvements in treatment, face mask wearing, a new virus strain, and
potentially changing demographics of infected patients, but none are
overwhelmingly convincing given the currently available evidence.

spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan, P.R. China, and subsequently, across the
world. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth
transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected
transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus
and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been
asked by the public is ""Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?"". While
different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases,
the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and
understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The
shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our
ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians
are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.
On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the
usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the
patients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being
tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under
investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical
viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and
inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general
public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based
reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help
the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most
importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make
sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best
medical outcome.

more countries are impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to

capabilities but sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management

RT-PCR and could help in this context.
  Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially

compartmental model. This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals'
decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an
individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting
infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers
his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be
high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed,
resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove
theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this
equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal
optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning
that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples
and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental
model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease.
In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and
societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to
individuals' fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still
underway.

that officially occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In late February,
the disease began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health,
social, and economic emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to
medium-term incidence of COVID-19 epidemic through the medium of an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to Italy,
Russia, and the USA The analysis is carried out on the number of new daily
confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website. The best ARIMA
models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results show
that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to
stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19
infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia
and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near
zero. This may suggest the importance of the application of quick and effective
lockdown measures, which have been relatively stricter in Italy. Therefore,
even if the results should be interpreted with caution, ARIMA models seem to be
a good tool that can help the health authorities to monitor the diffusion of
the outbreak.

confinement strategies on a most virulent epidemic. Our approach is motivated
by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two
populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which
the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non
confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The
model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following
a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the
differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is
observed in the COVID-19 epidemic.
  Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our
model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by
just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn
out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it
became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of
all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a
rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second
epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the
scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a
progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the
progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too
different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise
exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major
part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but
obeying rigorous distancing constraints.

of infectious disease require creating and enforcing the appropriate public
policies. One critical policy imposed by the policymakers is encouraging the
population to practice social distancing (i.e. controlling the contact rate
among the population). Here we pose a mean-field game model of individuals each
choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of gaining
utility but also risking infection from additional contacts. We compute and
compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes each
individual acting selfishly to maximize its own utility, to the socially
optimal strategy, which maximizes the total utility of the population. We prove
that the optimal decision of the infected is always to make more contacts than
the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the important
role of public policy to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining,
sick paid leave). Additionally, we include cost to incentivize people to change
strategies, when computing the socially optimal strategies. We find that with
this cost, policies reducing contacts of the infected should be further
enforced after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the
price of anarchy (PoA) of this system, to understand the conditions under which
large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise,
which is when intervening public policy would be most effective.

and (1-tier) contact tracing are both built into the model. Under plausible

combination with sufficient internal measures, which allow entities to confine
the virus without the need to revert back to more restrictive life styles or to
rely on herd immunity. When the base reproduction number of COVID-19 exceeds
2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the
spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically,
and resumes ""normal"", very strict pre-departure screening and test and
isolation upon arrival combined with effective contact tracing can only delay
another outbreak by 6 months. However, if the total net imported cases are
non-increasing, and the entity employs a confining domestic control policy,
then the total new cases can be contained even without border control.

  epidemic","One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is
to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control
its timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic
dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only
at the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire
time-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the
equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in
the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale
and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $\alpha$ and by
increasing the removal rate $\beta$ by a factor of $\lambda$. We show that for
a given value of the size ($I_P$, the total, $I_E$ and average $\hat I_P$
number of infected), its occurrence time $t_P$ and entire time-span $t_E$ can
be reduced by a factor $1/\lambda$ if the reduction of $I$ is achieved by
increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus,
epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by
prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on
social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern
Italy. We show that the peak time $t_P$ and the entire time span $t_E$ could
have been reduced by a factor $0.9 \le 1/\lambda\le 0.34$ with containment
measures focused on increasing $\beta$ instead of reducing $\alpha$.

  Learning Solution","In this work, we propose a collaborative city digital twin based on FL, a
novel paradigm that allowing multiple city DT to share the local strategy and
status in a timely manner. In particular, an FL central server manages the
local updates of multiple collaborators (city DT), provides a global model
which is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems, until the
model gains the correlations between various response plan and infection trend.
That means, a collaborative city DT paradigm based on FL techniques can obtain
knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs, and eventually establish a `global
view' for city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps to improve each city
digital twin selves by consolidating other DT's respective data without
violating privacy rules. To validate the proposed solution, we take COVID-19
pandemic as a case study. The experimental results on the real dataset with
various response plan validate our proposed solution and demonstrate the
superior performance.

  Trend Analysis","COVID-19's impact has surpassed from personal and global health to our social
life. In terms of digital presence, it is speculated that during pandemic,
there has been a significant rise in cyberbullying. In this paper, we have
examined the hypothesis of whether cyberbullying and reporting of such
incidents have increased in recent times. To evaluate the speculations, we
collected cyberbullying related public tweets (N=454,046) posted between
January 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. A simple visual frequentist analysis
ignores serial correlation and does not depict changepoints as such. To address
correlation and a relatively small number of time points, Bayesian estimation
of the trends is proposed for the collected data via an autoregressive Poisson
model. We show that this new Bayesian method detailed in this paper can clearly
show the upward trend on cyberbullying-related tweets since mid-March 2020.
However, this evidence itself does not signify a rise in cyberbullying but
shows a correlation of the crisis with the discussion of such incidents by
individuals. Our work emphasizes a critical issue of cyberbullying and how a
global crisis impacts social media abuse and provides a trend analysis model
that can be utilized for social media data analysis in general.

We find that the general reduction of the overall efficiency in the network of

of long-range connections. The impact, however, differs among nations according
to their initial mobility structure. Indeed, we find that the mobility network
after the lockdown is more concentrated in the case of France and UK and more

quantify the substantial impact of the lockdown.

are the unavailability of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines along with
the human to human transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus. So, there is urgent
need to search appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs.
In this communication, molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviral
drugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with the
three therapeutic target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease
(PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking results
of both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigational
drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drug
BXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock score
revealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of RdRp than
BXM. The computational molecular docking revealed that the drug BXA may be more
effective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.

  Augmentation and AutoML","Statistical methods such as the Box-Jenkins method for time-series
forecasting have been prominent since their development in 1970. Many
researchers rely on such models as they can be efficiently estimated and also
provide interpretability. However, advances in machine learning research
indicate that neural networks can be powerful data modeling techniques, as they
can give higher accuracy for a plethora of learning problems and datasets. In
the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their
overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models
especially for intermediate length times series data. Their modeling capacities
are limited in cases where enough data may not be available to estimate the
large number of parameters that these non-linear models require. This paper
presents an easy to implement data augmentation method to significantly improve
the performance of such networks. Our method, Augmented-Neural-Network, which
involves using forecasts from statistical models, can help unlock the power of
neural networks on intermediate length time-series and produces competitive
results. It shows that data augmentation, when paired with Automated Machine
Learning techniques such as Neural Architecture Search, can help to find the
best neural architecture for a given time-series. Using the combination of
these, demonstrates significant enhancement in the forecasting accuracy of
three neural network-based models for a COVID-19 dataset, with a maximum
improvement in forecasting accuracy by 21.41%, 24.29%, and 16.42%,
respectively, over the neural networks that do not use augmented data.

  India","COVID-19--a viral infectious disease--has quickly emerged as a global
pandemic infecting millions of people with a significant number of deaths
across the globe. The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the
symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely,
asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no
symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy
individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major
obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious
disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of
COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type
epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix
representing contact structures among different age groups of the population.
Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown
strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the
disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model
is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the
purpose of estimating the model parameters. Our model with zone-wise lockdown
is seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.

first learned as the environment model, and then we use the proposed

provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers. The application is

  of COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the potential of digital
misinformation in shaping the health of nations. The deluge of unverified
information that spreads faster than the epidemic itself is an unprecedented
phenomenon that has put millions of lives in danger. Mitigating this Infodemic
requires strong health messaging systems that are engaging, vernacular,
scalable, effective and continuously learn the new patterns of misinformation.
  Objective: We created WashKaro, a multi-pronged intervention for mitigating
misinformation through conversational AI, machine translation and natural
language processing. WashKaro provides the right information matched against
WHO guidelines through AI, and delivers it in the right format in local
languages.
  Methods: We theorize (i) an NLP based AI engine that could continuously
incorporate user feedback to improve relevance of information, (ii) bite sized
audio in the local language to improve penetrance in a country with skewed
gender literacy ratios, and (iii) conversational but interactive AI engagement
with users towards an increased health awareness in the community. Results: A
total of 5026 people who downloaded the app during the study window, among
those 1545 were active users. Our study shows that 3.4 times more females
engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of
AI-filtered news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning,
and the prudence of integrated AI chatbot Satya increased thus proving the
usefulness of an mHealth platform to mitigate health misinformation.
  Conclusion: We conclude that a multi-pronged machine learning application
delivering vernacular bite-sized audios and conversational AI is an effective
approach to mitigate health misinformation.

  COVID-19 Infodemic: Exploratory Study","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their
homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection,
which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation.
Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging,
and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the
evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts.
Results: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the
proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier
metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores
between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy
theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets
demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets
and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated
conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. Conclusions: Although we
focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is
not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation
in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to
counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized
misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to
target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become
incorporated.

age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions
with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows
correlations with the available official data on the number of infected
individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help
explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto
have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19
outbreak started in both North (Lombardia) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at
the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the beginning
of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences in regions
with higher epidemic risk. Our framework can be extended and tested on other
epidemic data, such as those on seasonal flu, and applied to other countries.
We also present a policy model connected with our methodology, which might help
policy-makers to take informed decisions.

  Identification and Severity Quantification","The current COVID-19 pandemic overloads healthcare systems, including
radiology departments. Though several deep learning approaches were developed
to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage directly as a computer
science problem. We describe two basic setups: Identification of COVID-19 to
prioritize studies of potentially infected patients to isolate them as early as
possible; Severity quantification to highlight studies of severe patients and
direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these
tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage.
Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing
methods provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. We employ a
multitask approach to consolidate both triage approaches and propose a
convolutional neural network to combine all available labels within a single
model. In contrast with the most popular multitask approaches, we add
classification layers to the most spatially detailed upper part of U-Net
instead of the bottom, less detailed latent representation. We train our model
on approximately 2000 publicly available CT studies and test it with a
carefully designed set consisting of 32 COVID-19 studies, 30 cases with
bacterial pneumonia, 31 healthy patients, and 30 patients with other lung
pathologies to emulate a typical patient flow in an out-patient hospital. The
proposed multitask model outperforms the latent-based one and achieves ROC AUC
scores ranging from 0.87+-01 (bacterial pneumonia) to 0.97+-01 (healthy
controls) for Identification of COVID-19 and 0.97+-01 Spearman Correlation for
Severity quantification. We release all the code and create a public
leaderboard, where other community members can test their models on our test
dataset.

disinfectant for a range of bacteria and viruses, including coronaviruses. As
such, a UV-C treatment in combination with a chemical wipe, such as EPA
hydrogen peroxide, is a common cleaning protocol in a medical setting, and such
disinfection protocols have gained in importance during the current COVID-19
pandemic due to the need to reuse PPE. However, given the substantial increase
in patient volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the
UV-C equipment throughput capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore,
there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system that can be rapidly deployed. In
response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and validated a UV-C
disinfection system from readily accessible components; specifically, a plastic
bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the
performance, the interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint,
forming a low quality-factor (Q) Fabry-Perot optical cavity. As part of this
work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for flexibility in
component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is
established. This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating
availability of source materials. The disinfection capabilities of the system
are validated using Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive endospore-forming

  Mila's Proposal for a Contact Tracing App","Contact tracing has grown in popularity as a promising solution to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of automated contact tracing are two-fold.
Contact tracing promises to reduce the number of infections by being able to:
1) systematically identify all of those that have been in contact with someone
who has had COVID; and, 2) ensure those that have been exposed to the virus do
not unknowingly infect others. ""COVI"" is the name of a recent contact tracing
app developed by Mila and was proposed to help combat COVID-19 in Canada. The
app was designed to inform each individual of their relative risk of being
infected with the virus, which Mila claimed would empower citizens to make
informed decisions about their movement and allow for a data-driven approach to
public health policy; all the while ensuring data is safeguarded from
governments, companies, and individuals. This article will provide a critical
response to Mila's COVI White Paper. Specifically, this article will discuss:
the extent to which diversity has been considered in the design of the app,
assumptions surrounding users' interaction with the app and the app's utility,
as well as unanswered questions surrounding transparency, accountability, and
security. We see this as an opportunity to supplement the excellent risk
analysis done by the COVI team to surface insights that can be applied to other
contact- and proximity-tracing apps that are being developed and deployed
across the world. Our hope is that, through a meaningful dialogue, we can
ultimately help organizations develop better solutions that respect the

dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease
spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian
approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model using
data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a
probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered

epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease
transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear
changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We
utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently
sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future
observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive
distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated
datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from four states of

has been a major roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and
containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes of
transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be
built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such
complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead
to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease.
The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent
of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies,
population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model -- the
Blue Sky model -- and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be
explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In
addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in
the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized
in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The
methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission
of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The
predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology
can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during

  and Florida Line-Level Data","Since the COVID-19 pandemic first reached the United States, the case
fatality rate has fallen precipitously. Several possible explanations have been
floated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing,
shifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and
reported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and
decreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level
data and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April
1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each
stratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the
hypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to
decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in
the national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the
national data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second
wave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR.
By contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second
peak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first
and second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by
November 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in
age-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding
factors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic
picture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis
is that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by
artifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but
also the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified
line-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.

outcomes (""CO-RISK"" score) were derived from model output and evaluated on the
testing dataset, as well as compared to human performance. The study's dataset
(the ""MGB COVID Cohort"") was constructed from all patients presenting to the
Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system from March 1st to June 1st, 2020.
ED visits with incomplete or erroneous data were excluded. Patients with no
test order for COVID or confirmed negative test results were excluded. Patients
under the age of 15 were also excluded. Finally, electronic health record (EHR)
data from a total of 11060 COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients were used
in this study. Chest X-ray (CXR) images were also collected from each patient
if available. Results show that CO-RISK score achieved area under the Curve
(AUC) of predicting MV/death (i.e. severe outcomes) in 24 hours of 0.95, and
0.92 in 72 hours on the testing dataset. The model shows superior performance
to the commonly used risk scores in ED (CURB-65 and MEWS). Comparing with
physician's decisions, CO-RISK score has demonstrated superior performance to
human in making ICU/floor decisions.

research, we further extend the stochastic model suggested in \cite{us} and
incorporate in it all available to us knowledge about parameters characterising
the behaviour of the virus and the illness induced by it. The models we use are
flexible, comprehensive, fast to run and allow us to incorporate the following:
-time-dependent strategies of handling the epidemic; -spatial heterogeneity of
the population and heterogeneity of development of epidemic in different areas;
-special characteristics of particular groups of people, especially people with
specific medical pre-histories and elderly.
  Standard epidemiological models such as SIR and many of its modifications are
not flexible enough and hence are not precise enough in the studies that
requires the use of the features above. Decision-makers get serious benefits
from using better and more flexible models as they can avoid of nuanced
lock-downs, better plan the exit strategy based on local population data,
different stages of the epidemic in different areas, making specific
recommendations to specific groups of people; all this resulting in a lesser
impact on economy, improved forecasts of regional demand upon NHS allowing for

  Hospitalization in Patients with Suspected COVID-19","The controversy of computed tomography (CT) use in COVID-19 screening is
associated with ambiguous characteristics of chest CT as a diagnostic test. The
reported values of CT sensitivity and specificity calculated using RT-PCR as a
reference standard vary widely. The objective of this study was to reevaluate
the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT using an alternative approach. This
study included 973 symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged 42 $\pm$ 17 years, 56%
females. We reviewed the disease dynamics between the initial and follow-up CT
studies using a ""CT0-4"" grading system. Sensitivity and specificity were
calculated as conditional probabilities that a patient's condition would
improve or deteriorate relative to the initial CT study results. For the
calculation of negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values, we
estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. We used several ARIMA and EST
models with different parameters to fit the data on total cases of COVID-19
from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, and forecast the incidence. The ""CT0-4""
grading scale demonstrated low sensitivity (28%) but high specificity (95%).
The best statistical model for describing the pandemic in Moscow was ETS with
multiplicative trend, error, and season type. According to our calculations,
with the predicted prevalence of 2.1%, the values of NPV and PPV would be 98%
and 10%, correspondingly. We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values with
the small sample size of the patients with severe symptoms and non-optimal
methodological setup for measuring these specific characteristics. The ""CT0-4""
grading scale was highly specific and predictive for identifying admissions to
hospitals of COVID-19 patients. Despite the ambiguous accuracy, chest CT proved
to be an effective practical tool for patient management during the pandemic,
provided that the necessary infrastructure and human resources are available.

one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and
deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind
speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected
individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in
hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high
polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a
greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with
pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low
wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the
air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence
of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus
disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved
only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but
also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable
development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to
prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on
sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and
cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the
factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in

  Results: As a product of this research, we present two networks, one from the

proteins in both networks, those that have the maximal value of calculated
invariants, these proteins are considered as the most: affected, connected or
those that best monitor the flow of information in the network, among them we
find UBC, a human protein related with ubiquination, linked with different
stages of coronavirus disease, and ORF7A a virus protein that induces apoptosis
in infected cells, associated with virion tethering. Using the constructed
networks, we establish the more significant diseases corresponding with human
proteins and their connections with other proteins. It is relevant that the
identified diseases coincide with comorbidities, particularly the subnetwork of
diabetes involves a great quantity of virus and human proteins (56%) and
interactions (60%), this could explain the effect of this condition as an
important cause of disease complications.

admission to death, is directly relevant to effective primary and secondary
care planning, and moreover, the mathematical modelling of the pandemic
generally. We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised
with COVID-19 using a large dataset ($N=21{,}000-157{,}000$) from the Brazilian
Sistema de Informa\c{c}\~ao de Vigil\^ancia Epidemiol\'ogica da Gripe database.
A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to
simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and
shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time,
with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of
15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability
density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best
fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for
onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological
distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first
estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the
subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be
correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker
correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.

million deaths, high morbidities, and economic distress worldwide. There is an
urgent need to identify medications that would treat and prevent novel diseases
like the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a promising
strategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due
to several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results
compared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore
computational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated
graph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID.
Although we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is
generic and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered
heterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases,
genes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem.
Specifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural
network (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered
graph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for
a disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as
Dexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different
pharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic). Out
of these 150 drugs, 46 drugs are currently in clinical trials. Dr-COVID is
evaluated in terms of its prediction performance and its ability to rank the
known treatment drugs for diseases as high as possible. For a majority of the
diseases, Dr-COVID ranks the actual treatment drug in the top 15.

  Main Protease","The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new
virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease
Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies
have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro
inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a
glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly
attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than
that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying
on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a
molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.
Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the
catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a
second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region
localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of
the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this
second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic
site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains
exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access
through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and
reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could
interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings
provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro
inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic
strategies for COVID-19.

exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans,
few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy.
At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the
biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of
COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from
COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.
We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in
the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a
deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify
them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as
of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of
COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that
COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute
to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19

distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of

nonsymptomatic contacts are fundamental strategies for mitigating the current
COVID-19 pandemic. The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary
strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital
(app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness
using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the
activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network
dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual
tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into
account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure.
This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during
the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the
intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision
to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual
tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not
adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while
they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show
that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic
hybrid protocols.

  cross-country analysis","The massive shock of the COVID-19 pandemic is already showing its negative
effects on economies around the world, unprecedented in recent history.
COVID-19 infections and containment measures have caused a general slowdown in
research and new knowledge production. Because of the link between R&D spending
and economic growth, it is to be expected then that a slowdown in research
activities will slow in turn the global recovery from the pandemic. Many recent
studies also claim an uneven impact on scientific production across gender. In
this paper, we investigate the phenomenon across countries, analysing preprint
depositions. Differently from other works, that compare the number of preprint
depositions before and after the pandemic outbreak, we analyse the depositions
trends across geographical areas, and contrast after-pandemic depositions with
expected ones. Differently from common belief and initial evidence, in few
countries female scientists increased their scientific output while males
plunged.

  lockdown policies on COVID-19 cases","To reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic most countries have implemented
several counter-measures to control the virus spread including school and
border closing, shutting down public transport and workplace and restrictions
on gathering. In this research work, we propose a deep-learning prediction
model for evaluating and predicting the impact of various lockdown policies on
daily COVID-19 cases. This is achieved by first clustering countries having
similar lockdown policies, then training a prediction model based on the daily
cases of the countries in each cluster along with the data describing their
lockdown policies. Once the model is trained, it can used to evaluate several
scenarios associated to lockdown policies and investigate their impact on the
predicted COVID cases. Our evaluation experiments, conducted on Qatar as a use
case, shows that the proposed approach achieved competitive prediction
accuracy. Additionally, our findings highlighted that lifting restrictions
particularly on schools and border opening would result in significant increase
in the number of cases during the study period.

quantitative reasoning -- rather than conceptual understanding -- in physics
contexts. We rapidly moved administration of the RBA online in Spring 2020 due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. We present our experiences with online, unproctored
administration of an RBA in development to students enrolled in a
large-enrollment, calculus-based, introductory physics course. We describe our
attempts to adhere to best practices on a limited time frame, and present a
preliminary analysis of the results, comparing results from the online
administration to earlier results from in-person, proctored administration. We
include discussion of online administration of
multiple-choice/multiple-response (MCMR) items, which we use on the instrument
as a way to probe multiple facets of student reasoning. Our initial comparison
indicates little difference between online and paper administrations of the
RBA, consistent with previous work by other researchers.

health authorities around the world have launched a number of contact-tracing
apps. Although contact tracing apps have received extensive attentions from the
research community, no existing work has characterized the users' adoption of
contact tracing apps from the app market level. In this work, we perform the
first market-level analysis of contact tracing apps. We perform a longitudinal
empirical study (over 4 months) of eight government-backed COVID-19 contact
tracing apps in iOS app store. We first collect all the daily meta information
(e.g., app updates, app rating, app comments, etc.) of these contact tracing
apps from their launch to 2020-07-31. Then we characterize them from release
practice, app popularity, and mobile users' feedback. Our study reveals various
issues related to contact tracing apps from the users' perspective, hoping to
help improve the quality of contact tracing apps and thus achieving a high
level of adoption in the population.

designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ventilator is intended to be
used both in and out of hospital intensive care units, and for both invasive
and non-invasive ventilation. The hardware can be complemented with an external
turbine for use in regions where compressed air supplies are not reliably
available. The standard modes provided include PC-A/C(Pressure Assist
Control),PC-A/C-PRVC(Pressure Regulated Volume Control), PC-PSV (Pressure
Support Ventilation) and CPAP (Continuous Positive airway pressure). HEV is
designed to support remote training and post market surveillance via a web
interface and data logging to complement the standard touch screen operation,
making it suitable for a wide range of geographical deployment. The HEV design
places emphasis on the quality of the pressure curves and the reactivity of the
trigger, delivering a global performance which will be applicable to ventilator
needs beyond theCOVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the conceptual design
and presents the prototype units together with their performance evaluation.

  Case Fatality Rate","The relative case fatality rates (CFRs) between groups and countries are key
measures of relative risk that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical
resource allocation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the middle of an
active outbreak when surveillance data is the primary source of information,
estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time
series of deaths, cases, and recoveries. These include time- and severity-
dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes.
In the context of COVID-19 CFR estimation, we survey such biases and their
potential significance. Further, we analyze theoretically the effect of certain
biases, like preferential reporting of fatal cases, on naive estimators of CFR.
We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that
accounts for time lag and imperfect reporting of deaths and recoveries. We show
that collection of randomized data by testing the contacts of infectious
individuals regardless of the presence of symptoms would mitigate bias by
limiting the covariance between diagnosis and death. Our analysis is
supplemented by theoretical and numerical results and a simple and fast
open-source codebase at https://github.com/aangelopoulos/cfr-covid-19 .
