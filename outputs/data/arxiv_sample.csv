  Coast regions of the United States","Forest fires impact on soil, water and biota resources has been widely
researched. Although forest fires profoundly impact the atmosphere and air
quality across the ecosystems, much less research has been developed to examine
its impact on the current pandemic. In-situ air pollution data were utilized to
examine the effects of the 2020 forest fire on atmosphere and coronavirus
(COVID 19) casualties. The spatiotemporal concentrations of particulate matter
(PM2.5 and PM10) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were collected from August 1 to
October 30 for 2020 (fire year) and 2019 (reference year). Both spatial
(Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression) and non spatial (negative
binomial regression) regression analysis was performed to assess the adverse
effects of fire emission on human health. The in situ data led measurements
showed that the maximum increases in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations were
clustered in the West Coastal fire-prone states during the August 1 to October
30 period. The average concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and
NO2 were increased in all the fire states affected badly by forest fires. The
average PM2.5 concentration over the period was recorded as 7.9, 6.3, 5.5, and
5.2 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington in 2019, which was
increased up to 24.9, 13.4, 25, and 17 in 2020. Both spatial and non-spatial
regression models exhibited a statistically significant association between
fire emission and COVID 19 incidents. A total of 30 models were developed for
analyzing the spatial non-stationary and local association between the
predictor and response factors. All these spatial models have demonstrated a
statistically significant association between fire emissions and COVID counts.
More thorough research is needed to better understand the complex association
between forest fire and human health.

  Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach","To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the
passenger's perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage,
airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews
(OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics
approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted
using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and
two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,
we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the
individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most
representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a
review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the
predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot
of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established
by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a
bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis
within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the
proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective
performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR.
Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our
results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the
airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.

  the COVID-19 Pandemic","The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased
the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the
same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted
their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot
be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights
-- as well as the possibility of controlling the system -- may be compromised.
Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many
variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different
models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and
assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem
using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and
observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic,
we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We
analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models,
considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which
leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models
according to their structural identifiability and observability under the
different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also
illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of
observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most
informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge
and measurements.

  between Income Groups","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments
have encouraged and ordered citizens to practice social distancing,
particularly by working and studying at home. Intuitively, only a subset of
people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little
research on the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups
in US cities during the pandemic. The authors worked to fill this gap by
quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater
Houston, Texas. In this paper, we determined human mobility using
pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal
study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total
travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip
distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent
disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular,
there was a strong negative correlation ($\rho$ = -0.90) between a traveler's
estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility
adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets
experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of
distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The
findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the
mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The
study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and
researchers alike in the wake of an epidemic.

spreading Coronavirus infestation. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which outbreak in 2002 and 2011, and
the current COVID-19 pandemic are all from the same family of coronavirus. This
work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using
deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A unique database was created,
so-called QU-COVID-family, consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS
CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to
identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify
the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN
classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to
visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the
decision of deep CNNs. Several Deep Learning classifiers were trained and
tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported. Original and preprocessed
images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks.
Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented
CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3
outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities
of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images,
respectively. In contrast, for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using
the original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities of 96.94%, 79.68%, and
90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. All
networks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (>96%) with the segmented
lung images. This indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases
in the eyes of AI, which is often a challenging task for medical doctors.

  COVID-19 on Vulnerable Individuals and the Approaches Required to Help them
  Emerge from Lockdown","COVID-19 has shown a relatively low mortality rate in young healthy
individuals, with the majority of this group being asymptomatic or having mild
symptoms, while the severity of the disease among individuals with underlying
health conditions has caused signiffcant mortality rates worldwide.
Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of
society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and
vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown.
However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered
in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups.
To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely
SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding
their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the
spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to
different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A
Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by
slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this
modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of
vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate
among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to
vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very
dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with
information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be
protected and kept safer. Widespread utilisation would extend the protection
further beyond these high risk groups.

  combinations against SARS-CoV-2 virus","In this study, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein with HIV drugs and their combinations. This glycoprotein is
essential for the reproduction of the SARS-COV-2 virus, so its inhibition opens
new avenues for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 disease. In doing so,
we used the VINI in silico model of cancer, whose high accuracy in finding
effective drugs and their combinations was confirmed in vitro by comparison
with existing results from NCI-60 bases, and in vivo by comparison with
existing clinical trial results. In the first step, the VINI model calculated
the inhibition efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with 44 FDA-approved
antiviral drugs. Of these drugs, HIV drugs have been shown to be effective,
while others mainly have shown weak or no efficiency. Subsequently, the VINI
model calculated the inhibition efficiency of all possible double and triple
HIV drug combinations, and among them identified ten with the highest
inhibition efficiency. These ten combinations were analyzed by Medscape
drug-drug interaction software and LexiComp Drug Interactions. All combinations
except the combination of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine appear to have
serious interactions (risk rating category D) when dosage
adjustments/reductions are required for possible toxicity. Finally, the VINI
model compared the inhibition efficiency of cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine
combination with cocktails and individual drugs already used or planned to be
tested against SARS-CoV-2. Combination cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine
demonstrated the highest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein over
others. Thus, this combination seems to be a promising candidate for the
further in vitro testing and clinical trials.

large population across the world and continues with its devastating
consequences. It is imperative to detect COVID-19 at the earliest to limit the
span of infection. In this work, a new classification technique CB-STM-RENet
based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Channel Boosting is
proposed for the screening of COVID-19 in chest X-Rays. In this connection, to
learn the COVID-19 specific radiographic patterns, a new convolution block
based on split-transform-merge (STM) is developed. This new block
systematically incorporates region and edge-based operations at each branch to
capture the diverse set of features at various levels, especially those related
to region homogeneity, textural variations, and boundaries of the infected
region. The learning and discrimination capability of the proposed CNN
architecture is enhanced by exploiting the Channel Boosting idea that
concatenates the auxiliary channels along with the original channels. The
auxiliary channels are generated from the pre-trained CNNs using Transfer
Learning. The effectiveness of the proposed technique CB-STM-RENet is evaluated
on three different datasets of chest X-Rays namely CoV-Healthy-6k,
CoV-NonCoV-10k, and CoV-NonCoV-15k. The performance comparison of the proposed
CB-STM-RENet with the existing techniques exhibits high performance both in
discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from Healthy, as well as, other types
of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all these
three datasets; especially on the stringent CoV-NonCoV-15k dataset. The good
detection rate (97%), and high precision (93%) of the proposed technique
suggest that it can be adapted for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients.

  cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown","Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

damage on people, infrastructure, and the environment. Motivated by the extreme
nature of the current global health landscape, which is plagued by the
coronavirus pandemic, we seek to better understand and model extreme events.
Modeling extreme events is common in practice and plays an important role in
time-series prediction applications. Our goal is to (i) compare and investigate
the effect of some common extreme events modeling methods to explore which
method can be practical in reality and (ii) accelerate the deep learning
training process, which commonly uses deep recurrent neural network (RNN), by
implementing the asynchronous local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) framework
among multiple compute nodes. In order to verify our distributed extreme events
modeling, we evaluate our proposed framework on a stock data set S\&P500, with
a standard recurrent neural network. Our intuition is to explore the (best)
extreme events modeling method which could work well under the distributed deep
learning setting. Moreover, by using asynchronous distributed learning, we aim
to significantly reduce the communication cost among the compute nodes and
central server, which is the main bottleneck of almost all distributed learning
frameworks.
  We implement our proposed work and evaluate its performance on representative
data sets, such as S&P500 stock in $5$-year period. The experimental results
validate the correctness of the design principle and show a significant
training duration reduction upto $8$x, compared to the baseline single compute
node. Our results also show that our proposed work can achieve the same level
of test accuracy, compared to the baseline setting.

shaken by the emergence of virus variants. The emergence of these more
contagious, more severe, or even vaccine-resistant strains have challenged
worldwide policy interventions. Anticipating the emergence of these mutations
to plan ahead adequate policies, and understanding how human behaviors may
affect the evolution of viruses by coevolution, are key challenges. In this
article, we propose coevolution with genetic algorithms (GAs) as a credible
approach to model this relationship, highlighting its implications, potential
and challenges. We present a dual GA model in which both viruses aiming for
survival and policy measures aiming at minimising infection rates in the
population, competitively evolve. Simulation runs reproduce the emergence of
more contagious variants, and identifies the evolution of policy responses as a
determinant cause of this phenomenon. This coevolution opens new possibilities
to visualise the impact of governments interventions not only on outbreak
dynamics, but also on its evolution, to improve the efficacy of policies.

  Domain Adaptation","Due to the shortage of COVID-19 viral testing kits and the long waiting time,
radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage
patients into different risk levels. Deep learning based methods have taken an
active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images,
as witnessed in many recent works in early 2020. Most of these works first
train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest
x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much
smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains
may lead to poor performance for CNN due to two issues, the large domain shift
present in the biomedical imaging datasets and the extremely small scale of the

pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our
work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the

data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19
infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd

cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement
three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this

cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model
called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the
pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic,
errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country
exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future
confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting

the importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public
transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for
infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns
and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus
critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For
instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent
in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions
such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider
multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for
the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide

passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the
distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate
disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We
investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while
varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our
results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions
simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different
groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single
dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given
specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination
efforts.

needs to be involved. The data collection of very basic and health-related data
of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan, protect, and
identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to
plan for or even implement. Thus, every individual, every human, and every

crises'. And since the individual is involved -- all individuals -- his/her (a)
health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance,
not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain
aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's
data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which
can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while
maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data
collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic

  with Natural Language Processing (NLP)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because
of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures
implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.

  Data on a National Level to Gauge Response Effectiveness","Predicting an accurate expected number of future COVID-19 cases is essential
to properly evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment or preventive measure.
This study aimed to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to
prospectively predict the expected number of cases without any intervention.
The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was
analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic,
Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The
resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent
data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the
current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions
with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate
model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as
determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately
predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance
respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The
simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future
cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results
demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given
country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated
models of population behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the
efficacy of current prescriptive measures against disease spread.

represent as a low-dimensional vector, ii) a graph attention network (GAT) to
apprehend correlations between tweets' words/entities and the corresponding
information types, and iii) a Relation Network as a learnable distance metric
to compute the similarity between tweets and their corresponding information
types in a supervised way. We conducted several experiments on two real
publicly-available datasets. Our results indicate that I-AID outperforms

  Empirical findings from Nanjing, China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered a worldwide outbreak of
pandemic, and transportation services have played a key role in coronavirus
transmission. Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro
car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the bike surface and take the
transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and
avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on
the trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel
demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the
perspective of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic
difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes
are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike
sharing during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies
sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly.
Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and
older adults are more dependent on bike sharing systems. Besides, the trip
decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a new concept of
user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes.
This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19
pandemic, and also inspires the blocking of viral transmission within the city.

extending to the center and south of Italy, including the two main islands.
  Objective. The creation of a forecast model that manages to alert the

emergence of any other pandemic outbreaks, or the arrival of subsequent
pandemic waves.
  Methods. A new mathematical model to describe the pandemic is given. The
model includes the class of undiagnosed infected people, and has a multi-region
extension, to cope with the in-time and in-space heterogeneity of the epidemic.
  Results. We obtain a robust and reliable tool for the forecast of the total
and active cases, which can be also used to simulate different scenarios.
  Conclusions. We are able to address a number of issues, such as assessing the
adoption of the lockdown in Italy, started from 11 March 2020, and how to
employ a rapid screening test campaign for containing the epidemic.

  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction","In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

Fully Connected Network) for the detection of COVID-19 using laboratory tests

in what laboratory tests or chest imaging may be available, DFCN is designed to
be robust to missing input data. An ablation study extensively evaluates the
performance benefits of the DFCN architecture as well as its robustness to
missing inputs. Data from 1088 patients with confirmed RT-PCR results are
obtained from two independent medical facilities. The data collected includes
results from 27 laboratory tests and a chest x-ray scored by a deep learning
network. Training and test datasets are defined based on the source medical
facility. Data is made publicly available. The performance of DFCN in
predicting the RT-PCR result is compared with 3 related architectures as well
as a Random Forest baseline. All models are trained with varying levels of
masked input data to encourage robustness to missing inputs. Missing data is
simulated at test time by masking inputs randomly. Using area under the
receiver operating curve (AUC) as a metric, DFCN outperforms all other models
with statistical significance using random subsets of input data with 2-27
available inputs. When all 28 inputs are available DFCN obtains an AUC of
0.924, higher than achieved by any other model. Furthermore, with clinically
meaningful subsets of parameters consisting of just 6 and 7 inputs

Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the
COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and
the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an
area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a

standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone,
alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this
study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning

approaches used in literature are examined in detail. The Computed Tomography

using the DL algorithms. The first step is the pre-processing of these images
to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep
models (pre-trained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.).
Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide
whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease.

(UDC-Net) for semi-supervised COVID-19 lesion segmentation from CT images.
Specifically, we present a dual-consistency learning scheme that simultaneously
imposes image transformation equivalence and feature perturbation invariance to
effectively harness the knowledge from unlabeled data. We then quantify the
segmentation uncertainty in two forms and employ them together to guide the
consistency regularization for more reliable unsupervised learning. Extensive
experiments showed that our proposed UDC-Net improves the fully supervised
method by 6.3% in Dice and outperforms other competitive semi-supervised
approaches by significant margins, demonstrating high potential in real-world
clinical practice.

  quantification","We propose a new method in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is
used to quantify the uncertainty of forward simulations in the presence of
observed data. Previously, a method has been developed which enables GANs to
make time series predictions and data assimilation by training a GAN with
unconditional simulations of a high-fidelity numerical model. After training,
the GAN can be used to predict the evolution of the spatial distribution of the
simulation states and observed data is assimilated. In this paper, we describe
the process required in order to quantify uncertainty, during which no
additional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model are required. These
methods take advantage of the adjoint-like capabilities of generative models
and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. Set within a
reduced-order model framework for efficiency, we apply these methods to a
compartmental model in epidemiology to predict the spread of COVID-19 in an
idealised town. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently
quantify uncertainty in the presence of measurements using only unconditional
simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model.

  evidence based on the 1987 crash, 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic","Every unique crisis, a new and novel risk factor, leads to a rapid,
synchronous and panic sell-off by the investors that lead to a massive stock
market crash, termed as mainshock, which usually continues for more than one
day. Though most of the stocks start recovering from the crash within a short
period, the effect of the crash remains throughout the recovery phase. During
the recovery, as the market remains in stress, any small perturbation leads to
a relatively smaller aftershock, which may also occur for a few days.
Statistical analysis of the mainshock and the aftershocks for the crash of
1987, the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic shows that they
follow the Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) power law. The duration of the influence of
the mainshock, within which aftershocks are considered, has been calculated
using structural break analysis. The analysis shows that high magnitude
aftershocks comparable to the mainshock are rare but low magnitude aftershocks
can be seen frequently till the full recovery of the market. It is also
consistent with the psychology of the investors that when the unique crisis
becomes known, the market does not react too irrationally as it did initially,
and hence subsequent crashes become relatively smaller. The results indicate
that there is a possibility of the occurrence of future low magnitude
aftershocks due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis may help
investors make rational investment decisions during the stressed period after a
major market crash.

  factors in developing human embryos","To predict if developing human embryos are permissive to coronaviruses, we
analyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell,
8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm
for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein
cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes
involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2,
BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst
including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are
co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the
trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for
proteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We
identified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are
enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are
common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid
metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
Together our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive
to coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they
also express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and
replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient
management for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  COVID-19 Diagnosis: A Review","The challenge of learning a new concept, object, or a new medical disease
recognition without receiving any examples beforehand is called Zero-Shot
Learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies
such as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement
of large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the
model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on
previously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary
information. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from
unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and
unforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We
introduce a novel and broaden solution called Few/one-shot learning, and
present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot
learning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot
Learning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our
recommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over
each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the
best techniques and practices based on their applications. We then review
through different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety
of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss
the recent applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful
intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning
tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications
in the current modern yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast
diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging the readers to develop other
similar AI-based automated detection/recognition systems using ZSL.

  Predictions and the Real Data, and Predictions about Returning to Normal Life","A new coronavirus disease, called COVID-19, appeared in the Chinese region of
Wuhan at the end of last year; since then the virus spread to other countries,
including most of Europe. We propose a differential equation governing the
evolution of the COVID-19. This dynamic equation also describes the evolution
of the number of infected people for 13 common respiratory viruses (including
the SARS-CoV-2). We validate our theoretical predictions with experimental data

logistic model. We find that our predictions are in good agreement with the
real world since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this is not
the case for the logistic model that only applies to the first days. The second
part of the work is devoted to modelling the descending phase, i.e. the
decrease of the number of people tested positive for COVID-19. Also in this
case, we propose a new set of dynamic differential equations that we solved
numerically. We use our differential equations parametrised with experimental
data to make several predictions, such as the date when Italy, Belgium, and
Luxembourg will reach a peak number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people. The
descending curves provide valuable information such as the duration of the
COVID-19 epidemic in a given Country and therefore when it will be possible to
return to normal life. The study of the the dynamics of COVID-19 when the

probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered

epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease
transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear
changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We
utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently
sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future
observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive
distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated

  posteroanterior chest X-ray images","The infection of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starts with
the upper respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the infection can progress
to lungs and develop pneumonia. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less
sensitive during early stages; especially if the patient is asymptomatic, which
may further cause more severe pneumonia. In this context, several deep learning
models have been proposed to identify pulmonary infections using publicly
available chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis, better
treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of
COVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and
Tuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning
models. All deep learning models opted class balancing techniques to solve this
issue; which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process.
Moreover, the deep learning models are also data hungry and need massive
computation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this research proposes
a novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine
(PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples
with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false
predictions. The performance of the proposed model is compared with
conventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental
results prove that the proposed model outperformed over state-of-the-art

  Predict the Covid-19 Outbreak","Background. Forecasting the time of forthcoming pandemic reduces the impact
of diseases by taking precautionary steps such as public health messaging and
raising the consciousness of doctors. With the continuous and rapid increase in
the cumulative incidence of COVID-19, statistical and outbreak prediction
models including various machine learning (ML) models are being used by the
research community to track and predict the trend of the epidemic, and also in
developing appropriate strategies to combat and manage its spread. Methods. In
this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various ML approaches
including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and
Artificial Neural Network in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in the
epidemiological domain. We first apply the autoregressive distributed lag
(ARDL) method to identify and model the short and long-run relationships of the
time-series COVID-19 datasets. That is, we determine the lags between a
response variable and its respective explanatory time series variables as
independent variables. Then, the resulting significant variables concerning
their lags are used in the regression model selected by the ARDL for predicting
and forecasting the trend of the epidemic. Results. Statistical measures i.e.,
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for model accuracy. The values of MAPE for the
best selected models for confirmed, recovered and deaths cases are 0.407, 0.094
and 0.124 respectively, which falls under the category of highly accurate
forecasts. In addition, we computed fifteen days ahead forecast for the daily
deaths, recover, and confirm patients and the cases fluctuated across time in
all aspects. Besides, the results reveal the advantages of ML algorithms for
supporting decision making of evolving short term policies.

individual testing approach has received a lot of interest lately for massive
testing of COVID-19. Many studies simply assume samples mixed in a group are
independent. However, this assumption may not be reasonable for a contagious
disease like COVID-19. Specifically, people within a family tend to infect each
other and thus are likely to be positively correlated. By exploiting positive
correlation, we make the following two main contributions. One is to provide a
rigorous proof that further cost reduction can be achieved by using the Dorfman
two-stage method when samples within a group are positively correlated. The
other is to propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm for pooled testing
with a social graph, where an edge in the social graph connects frequent social
contacts between two persons. Such an algorithm leads to notable cost reduction
(roughly 20%-35%) compared to random pooling when the Dorfman two-stage
algorithm is applied.

  Generation via Risk Estimation","Understanding the relationships between biomedical terms like viruses, drugs,

been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of
hypothesis generation(HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit
connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to
truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also
assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative

future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via
positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal
evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and
unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the

  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?","As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.

the ratio of the difference $ (I_h - I_{\ell})$ and the geometric mean

that the healthcare capacity and the testing rate highly affect the optimal

  X-ray Images","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most destructive pandemic
after millennium, forcing the world to tackle a health crisis. Automated lung
infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen
diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19
from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared
spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between
cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged
disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To
address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft
Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19

vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of
trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided
augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims
at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale
attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR
image dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates
its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models. The

  On Deep COVID-19 Models","Early identification of COVID-19 using a deep model trained on Chest X-Ray
and CT images has gained considerable attention from researchers to speed up
the process of identification of active COVID-19 cases. These deep models act
as an aid to hospitals that suffer from the unavailability of specialists or
radiologists, specifically in remote areas. Various deep models have been
proposed to detect the COVID-19 cases, but few works have been performed to
prevent the deep models against adversarial attacks capable of fooling the deep
model by using a small perturbation in image pixels. This paper presents an
evaluation of the performance of deep COVID-19 models against adversarial
attacks. Also, it proposes an efficient yet effective Fuzzy Unique Image
Transformation (FUIT) technique that downsamples the image pixels into an
interval. The images obtained after the FUIT transformation are further
utilized for training the secure deep model that preserves high accuracy of the
diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and provides reliable defense against the
adversarial attacks. The experiments and results show the proposed model
prevents the deep model against the six adversarial attacks and maintains high
accuracy to classify the COVID-19 cases from the Chest X-Ray image and CT image

  Restrictions for Epidemic Control","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across more than 180
countries and territories since late January 2020. As a worldwide emergency
response, governments have taken various measures and implemented policies,
such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional
lockdown, to control the rapid spread of this epidemic. The common intention of
these countermeasures is to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a
highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission.
Medical experts and policy makers have expressed the urgency of being able to
effectively evaluate the effects of human restriction policies with the aid of
big data and information technology. Thus, in this study, based on big human
mobility data and city POI data, we designed an interactive visual analytics
system named EpiMob (Epidemic Mobility). The system interactively simulates the
changes in human mobility and the number of infected people in response to the
implementation of a certain restriction policy or combination of policies
(e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently
designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction
policies, and the result reflecting the infection situation under different
policies is dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared. We completed
multiple case studies of the largest metropolitan area in Japan (i.e., Greater
Tokyo Area) and conducted interviews with domain experts to demonstrate that
our system can provide illustrative insight by measuring and comparing the

stage towards accurate diagnosis and severity measurement of COVID-19.
Traditional U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture and its variants suffer from
diminutions of contextual information in pooling/upsampling operations with
increased semantic gaps among encoded and decoded feature maps as well as
instigate vanishing gradient problems for its sequential gradient propagation
that result in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, operating with 3D CT-volume
poses further limitations due to the exponential increase of computational
complexity making the optimization difficult. In this paper, an automated
COVID-19 lesion segmentation scheme is proposed utilizing a highly efficient
neural network architecture, namely CovSegNet, to overcome these limitations.
Additionally, a two-phase training scheme is introduced where a deeper
2D-network is employed for generating ROI-enhanced CT-volume followed by a
shallower 3D-network for further enhancement with more contextual information
without increasing computational burden. Along with the traditional vertical
expansion of Unet, we have introduced horizontal expansion with multi-stage
encoder-decoder modules for achieving optimum performance. Additionally,
multi-scale feature maps are integrated into the scale transition process to
overcome the loss of contextual information. Moreover, a multi-scale fusion
module is introduced with a pyramid fusion scheme to reduce the semantic gaps
between subsequent encoder/decoder modules while facilitating the parallel
optimization for efficient gradient propagation. Outstanding performances have
been achieved in three publicly available datasets that largely outperform
other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed scheme can be easily extended

  During COVID-19?","Digital contact tracing and analysis of social distancing from smartphone
location data are two prime examples of non-therapeutic interventions used in
many countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many
understand the importance of trading personal privacy for the public good,
others have been alarmed at the potential for surveillance via measures enabled
through location tracking on smartphones. In our research, we analyzed massive
yet atomic individual-level location data containing over 22 billion records
from ten Blue (Democratic) and ten Red (Republican) cities in the U.S., based
on which we present, herein, some of the first evidence of how Americans
responded to the increasing concerns that government authorities, the private
sector, and public health experts might use individual-level location data to
track the COVID-19 spread. First, we found a significant decreasing trend of
mobile-app location-sharing opt-out. Whereas areas with more Democrats were
more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of
the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out
rates after COVID-19, and this effect was more salient among Democratic than
Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those
who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic)
were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who
practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among
Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males,
compared with low-income populations and females, were more
privacy-conscientious and more likely to opt-out of location tracking.

pattern of a patient is crucial to respiratory rehabilitation therapies such as
magnetic resonance exams for respiratory-triggered imaging, chronic pulmonary
disease treatment, and synchronized functional electrical stimulation. While
numerous respiratory devices have been developed, they are often in direct
contact with a patient, which can yield inaccurate or limited data. In this
study, we developed a novel, non-invasive, and contactless magnetic sensing
platform that can precisely monitor breathing, movement, or sleep patterns of a
patient, thus providing efficient monitoring at a clinic or home. A magneto-LC
resonance (MLCR) sensor converts the magnetic oscillations generated by
breathing of the patient into an impedance spectrum, which allows for a deep
analysis of breath variation to identify respiratory-related diseases like
COVID-19. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity, the MLCR sensor yields a distinct
breathing pattern for each patient tested. The sensor also provides an accurate
measure of the strength of breath at multiple stages as well as anomalous
variations in respiratory rate and amplitude. This suggests that the MLCR
sensor can detect symptoms of COVID-19 in a patient due to shortness of breath
or difficulty breathing as well as track the progress of the disease in real
time.

  COVID-19 pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the utility of contact tracing, when
combined with case isolation and social distancing, as an important tool for
mitigating the spread of a disease [1]. Contact tracing provides a mechanism of
identifying individuals with a high likelihood of previous exposure to a
contagious disease, allowing additional precautions to be put in place to
prevent continued transmission. Here we consider a cryptographic approach to
contact tracing based on secure two-party computation (2PC). We begin by
considering the problem of comparing a set of location histories held by two
parties to determine whether they have come within some threshold distance
while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the location histories. We
propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an
equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2]. We discuss how this protocol
can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios,
including both app-based approaches and approaches which leverage location
history held by telecoms and internet service providers. We examine the
efficiency of this approach and show that existing infrastructure is sufficient
to support anonymised contact tracing at a national level.

multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief
utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify a
constraint to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for
each resource. Such constraints often arise from location constraints (e.g.
among all of the volunteer nurses, only those who live nearby can work at
hospital A due to commute constraints. So hospital A can only receive
allocations of volunteers from a subset of the total supply). This can also
model a type of substitute effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A
\emph{or} B, but some other agents specifically want A, and some specifically
want B. We propose a new mechanism called Group Dominant Resource Fairness
which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs.
The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness,
strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first mechanism to achieve all four
properties in our setting. Furthermore, we show numerically that our method
scales better to large problems than alternative approaches. Finally, although
motivated by the problem of medical resource allocation in a pandemic, our
mechanism can be applied more broadly to resource allocation under Leontief
utilities with accessibility constraints.

  for Linkage Disequilibrium and Idiosyncratic Pleiotropy with Applications to

variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of modifiable
risk factors on an outcome of interest. Despite wide uses of various popular
two-sample MR methods based on genome-wide association study summary level
data, however, those methods could suffer from potential power loss or/and
biased inference when the chosen genetic variants are in linkage disequilibrium
(LD), and also have relatively large direct effects on the outcome whose
distribution might be heavy-tailed which is commonly referred to as the
idiosyncratic pleiotropy phenomenon. To resolve those two issues, we propose a
novel Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization (RBMR) model that uses the more
robust multivariate generalized t-distribution to model such direct effects in
a probabilistic model framework which can also incorporate the LD structure
explicitly. The generalized t-distribution can be represented as a Gaussian
scaled mixture so that our model parameters can be estimated by the EM-type
algorithms. We compute the standard errors by calibrating the evidence lower
bound using the likelihood ratio test. Through extensive simulation studies, we
show that our RBMR has robust performance compared to other competing methods.
We also apply our RBMR method to two benchmark data sets and find that RBMR has
smaller bias and standard errors. Using our proposed RBMR method, we find that

as well as devising a treatment plan. This work proposes a two-stage deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based framework for delineation of

COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete
wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the
proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images
classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the
identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we
propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically
uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This
systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed
CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region
homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with
mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a
standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the

evaluated using Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) measure (0.98) and that of

in regular and critical care units, releases and deaths, using extended SEIR
models. These involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions,
assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, $R_0$,
before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The
joint-region Bayesian analysis allows precise evaluations of the time/fraction
ratios and pre-hospitalized fractions. The hospital data are well fit by the
models, except the arrivals in critical care, which decrease faster than
predicted, indicating better treatment over time. Averaged over France, the
analysis yields $R_0$= 3.4$\pm$0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65$\pm$0.04 (90%
c.l.) during the lockdown, with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the
Infection Fatality Rate in France was 4 $\pm$1% (90% c.l.), while the Feverish
vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the
lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have
occurred throughout France, while a lockdown that would have been enforced 10
days earlier would have led to less than 1000 deaths. The fraction of immunized
people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April
2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity. The widespread
availability of face masks on 11 May, when the lockdown was partially lifted,
should keep $R_0$ below unity if at least 46% of the population wear them

second wave is inevitable and cause the number of deaths to triple between
early May and October (if $R_0$=1.2) or even late June (if $R_0$=2).

median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of
positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.
The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We
estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We
estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around
February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in
nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of
COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely
unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We
observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with
an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive
containment strategies are required to control COVID-19 spread and catastrophic
outcomes for the healthcare system.

disease caused by viral infection. The clinical symptoms and transmission
routes of the two diseases are similar. However, there are no relevant studies
on laboratory diagnostic models to discriminate COVID-19 and influenza A. This
study aims at establishing a signature of laboratory findings to tell patients

study, 56 COVID-19 patients and 54 influenza A patients were included.
Laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were
obtained from electronic medical record databases. Elastic network models,
followed by a stepwise logistic regression model were implemented to identify
indicators capable of discriminating COVID-19 and influenza A. A nomogram is
diagramed to show the resulting discriminative model. Results: The majority of
hematological and biochemical parameters in COVID-19 patients were
significantly different from those in influenza A patients. In the final model,
albumin/globulin (A/G), total bilirubin (TBIL) and erythrocyte specific volume

validated to perform well. Conclusion: A diagnostic model of laboratory
findings was established, in which A/G, TBIL and HCT were included as highly
relevant indicators for the segmentation of COVID-19 and influenza A, providing
a complimentary means for the precise diagnosis of these two diseases.

  for Interpretable Prognosis","Due to the characteristics of COVID-19, the epidemic develops rapidly and
overwhelms health service systems worldwide. Many patients suffer from systemic
life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the
intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an
early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical
resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the
data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic
mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we
propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing
electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with
emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical
features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The
transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's
representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the
health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length
of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset.
The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently
outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1)
hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose
abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of
gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical
findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and

global public health concern. A great proportion of the world needs to be
vaccinated in order to stop the rapid spread of the disease. In addition to
prioritising vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, an
ideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fine-grained contact networks to
prioritise vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due to
the enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does not
capture indirect famine or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed a
new vaccination strategy called Individual's Movement-based Vaccination (IMV),
which takes into account both direct and indirect transmission and is based on
the types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in the
case of influenza-like diseases. This paper studies the application of IMV to
COVID-19 using its documented transmission parameters. We conduct large scale
computer simulations based on a city-wide empirical mobility dataset to
evaluate the performance and practicability of the strategy. Results show that
the proposed strategy achieves nearly five times the efficiency of random
vaccination and performs comparably to the degree-based strategy, while
significantly reducing the data collection requirements.

students when schools reopen. Conventionally, fixed air filters are not used as
a key pandemic prevention method for public indoor spaces because they are
unable to trap the airborne pathogens in time in the entire room. However, by
combining the mobility of a robot with air filtration, the efficacy of cleaning
up the air around multiple people is largely increased. A disinfection co-robot
prototype is thus developed to provide continuous and occupant-friendly
protection to people gathering indoors, specifically for students in a
classroom scenario. In a static classroom with students sitting in a grid
pattern, the mobile robot is able to serve up to 14 students per cycle while
reducing the worst-case pathogen dosage by 20%, and with higher robustness
compared to a static filter. The extent of robot protection is optimized by
tuning the passing distance and speed, such that a robot is able to serve more
people given a threshold of worst-case dosage a person can receive.

STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal

the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of

significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in

intersections concerning nationalism, religiosity, and anti-immigrant sentiment
from a socio-cognitive perspective by applying a mixed-method approach (survey
and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion threats have caused
huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature
on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the
role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can
fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's
life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's
life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural
disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing).
These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and
other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist
and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin
to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our
theoretical framework and explore the different possible relationships in an
online sample. The second is a study of a computer simulation. Both studies
(completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables,
enabling us to identify trends that require further explanation and research as
we move toward models that can adequately inform policy discussions.

of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It takes into account the known special
characteristics of this disease such as the existence of infectious undetected
cases and the different social and infectiousness conditions of infected
people. In particular, it considers the social structure and governmental
measures in a country, the fraction of detected cases over the real total
infected cases, and the influx of undetected infected people from outside the
borders. Although the model is simple and allows a reasonable identification of
its parameters, using the data provided by local authorities on this pandemic,
it is also complex enough to capture the most important effects. We study the
particular case of Lebanon and use its reported data to estimate the model
parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in
other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the
estimations given by our model. We also simulate several scenarios that help
policy makers in deciding how to loosen different measures without risking a
severe wave of COVID-19. We are also able to identify the main factors that
lead to specific scenarios which helps in a better understanding of the spread
of the virus.

  multiphase lattice Boltzmann method","The aerosol formation is associated with the rupture of the liquid plug
during the pulmonary airway reopening. The fluid dynamics of this process is
difficult to predict because the rupture involved complex liquid-gas
transition. Equation of state (EOS) plays a key role in the thermodynamic
process of liquid-gas transition. Here, we propose an EOS-based multiphase
lattice Boltzmann model, in which the nonideal force is directly evaluated by
EOSs. This multiphase model is used to model the pulmonary airway reopening and
study aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first
validated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in
reasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and
without aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the
injury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the
same that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway
increases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate
the effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size
and the mechanical stresses. The results show that aerosol size and the
mechanical stresses increase as the pressure drop enlarges and thickness of
liquid plug become thicken, while aerosol size and the mechanical stresses
decrease as thickness of liquid film is thicken. The present multiphase model
can be extended to study the generation and transmission of bioaerosols which
can carry the bioparticles of influenza or coronavirus.

clearest path forward to eliminate community spread hence end the ongoing

administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere
to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? To
address this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread
incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We
use this model to study two important measures of disease control and
eradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive
care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence,
vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to
the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by
a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the
population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast,
with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly
exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. These findings
highlight the complex interplays involved between vaccination and social
protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with
extent social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of

diagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection
measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on
radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data
systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we
explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a
single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological
images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called
CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given
condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our
CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of
COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution
radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep
classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from
CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results
are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely
small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data
augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset
(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the
performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on
large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19
diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent
the possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of
23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index $(R^{CFD}_j\geq 0.9)$
while the remaining 87% were found generally irreproducible $(R^{CFD}_j<0.9)$.
Without reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will
remain hindered, fragmented and limited. In conclusion, I call the scientific
community to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and publishing CFD
simulations in COVID-19 research.

  Feasibility and Optimal Pool Size Selection with Dilution Effects","Repeated asymptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 promises to control spread of
the virus but would require too many resources to implement at scale. Group
testing is promising for screening more people with fewer test resources:
multiple samples tested together in one pool can be excluded with one negative
test result. Existing approaches to group testing design for SARS-CoV-2
asymptomatic screening, however, do not consider dilution effects: that false
negatives become more common with larger pools. As a consequence, they may
recommend pool sizes that are too large or misestimate the benefits of
screening. Modeling dilution effects, we derive closed-form expressions for the
expected number of tests and false negative/positives per person screened under
two popular group testing methods: the linear and square array methods. We find
that test error correlation induced by a common viral load across an
individual's samples results in many fewer false negatives than would be
expected from less realistic but more widely assumed independent errors. This
insight also suggests that false positives can be controlled through repeated
tests without significantly increasing false negatives. Using these closed-form
expressions to trace a Pareto frontier over error rates and tests, we design
testing protocols for repeated asymptomatic screening of a large population. We
minimize disease prevalence by optimizing a time-varying pool sizes and
screening frequency constrained by daily test capacity and a false positive
limit. This provides a testing protocol practitioners can use for mitigating
COVID-19. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology
in controlling spread.

  for Tackling COVID-19","The current COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus
has resulted in over a million deaths and is having a grave socio-economic
impact, hence there is an urgency to find solutions to key research challenges.
Much of this COVID-19 research depends on distributed computing. In this
article, I review distributed architectures -- various types of clusters, grids
and clouds -- that can be leveraged to perform these tasks at scale, at
high-throughput, with a high degree of parallelism, and which can also be used
to work collaboratively. High-performance computing (HPC) clusters will be used
to carry out much of this work. Several bigdata processing tasks used in
reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require high-throughput approaches, and a
variety of tools, which Hadoop and Spark offer, even using commodity hardware.
Extremely large-scale COVID-19 research has also utilised some of the world's
fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's SUMMIT -- for ensemble docking
high-throughput screening against SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug-repurposing, and
high-throughput gene analysis -- and Sentinel, an XPE-Cray based system used to
explore natural products. Grid computing has facilitated the formation of the
world's first Exascale grid computer. This has accelerated COVID-19 research in
molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions through
massively-parallel computation and was performed with over 1 million volunteer
computing devices using the Folding@home platform. Grids and clouds both can
also be used for international collaboration by enabling access to important
datasets and providing services that allow researchers to focus on research
rather than on time-consuming data-management tasks.

case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from
different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a
model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then
introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social
distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal
control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on
the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of
suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the
exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input
is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with
the implemented system of reopening `in phases'. For all the areas considered,
this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level
estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the
control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this
period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the
case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly
colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields
progressively stricter measures of social distancing. {We finally compute the
optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of
vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of
factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the

countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the
outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and
whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public
discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different
lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and
informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper
develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown
policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point,
and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific
policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior --
the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,
Recovered) model as a prior mean function with ""country-and-policy-specific""
parameters that capture fatality curves under ""counterfactual"" policies within
each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and
learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and
its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of
SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and
gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors)
-- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational
inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with

exploring the general benefits and challenges of hackathons and then trying to
understand how they were affected by the virtual setup. We conducted nine
interviews, surveyed 23 employees and analyzed a hackathon demo. We found that
hackathons provide both individual and organizational benefits of innovation,
personal interests, and acquiring new skills and competences. Several
challenges such as added stress due to stopping the regular work, employees
fearing not having enough contribution to deliver and potential mismatch
between individual and organizational goals were also found. With respect to

  Challenges with Recommendations","Coronavirus disease 2019, i.e. COVID-19 has imposed the public health measure
of keeping social distancing for preventing mass transmission of COVID-19. For
monitoring the social distancing and keeping the trace of transmission, we are
obligated to develop various types of digital surveillance systems, which
include contact tracing systems and drone-based monitoring systems. Due to the
inconvenience of manual labor, traditional contact tracing systems are
gradually replaced by the efficient automated contact tracing applications that
are developed for smartphones. However, the commencement of automated contact
tracing applications introduces the inevitable privacy and security challenges.
Nevertheless, unawareness and/or lack of smartphone usage among mass people
lead to drone-based monitoring systems. These systems also invite unwelcomed
privacy and security challenges. This paper discusses the recently designed and
developed digital surveillance system applications with their protocols
deployed in several countries around the world. Their privacy and security
challenges are discussed as well as analyzed from the viewpoint of privacy

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019

testing many potentially infected individuals is often a limiting factor in
controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. Hence, pooling strategies, wherein individuals
are grouped and tested simultaneously, are employed. We present a novel pooling
strategy that implements D-Optimal Pooling Experimental design (DOPE). DOPE
defines optimal pooled tests as those maximizing the mutual information between
data and infection states. We estimate said mutual information via Monte-Carlo
sampling and employ a discrete optimization heuristic for maximizing it. DOPE
outperforms common pooling strategies both in terms of lower error rates and
fewer tests utilized. DOPE holds several additional advantages: it provides
posterior distributions of the probability of infection, rather than only
binary classification outcomes; it naturally incorporates prior information of
infection probabilities and test error rates; and finally, it can be easily
extended to include other, newly discovered information regarding COVID-19.
Hence, we believe that implementation of Bayesian D-optimal experimental design
holds a great promise for the efforts of combating COVID-19 and other future
pandemics.

approach to segment lung regions infected by COVID-19 to help cardiologists

bifurcated 2-D model for two types of segmentation. This model uses a shared
encoder and a bifurcated connection to two separate decoders. One decoder is
for segmentation of the healthy region of the lungs, while the other is for the
segmentation of the infected regions. Experiments on publically available

of images that are acquired from a single source, clinicians often use
multi-domain data for a detailed analysis. For instance, CT and MRI have
advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output
characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current
segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to
their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all
modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,
robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training
step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all
available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.
For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can
learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct
and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift
property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where
sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is
used to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed
method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either
training or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in
routine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other

differences are observed. Similarly, the proposed method achieves the best

variance explained by an affine combination of multiple explanatory covariates.
An attribution of this explanatory contribution to each of the individual

ascertaining such an attribution is via the game theoretic Shapley value
decomposition of the coefficient of determination. Such a decomposition has the
desirable efficiency, monotonicity, and equal treatment properties. Under a
weak assumption that the joint distribution is pseudo-elliptical, we obtain the
asymptotic normality of the Shapley values. We then utilize this result in
order to construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests regarding such
quantities. Monte Carlo studies regarding our results are provided. We found
that our asymptotic confidence intervals are computationally superior to
competing bootstrap methods and are able to improve upon the performance of

connect with large Internet service providers (eyeball networks) through
dedicated private peering. The capacity of these private network interconnects
is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users.
Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a
content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect
may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the
excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are
rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet
service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and
disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid
by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic
overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be
able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs
and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based
on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short

ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic
measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a

the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Recently, deep learning methods have
carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical image tasks. However,
conventional deep learning have two main drawbacks: 1) insufficient training
data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data.
In this paper, we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for
medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue
(Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed
Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the
novelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed
method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant
Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to a not
well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant
Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even
when the domains or the tasks are entirely different. In this study, we develop
a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Catech-256, and
chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19
lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the
proposed method benefits from unlabeled data collected from distant domains
which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution
shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\%
classification accuracy, which is 13\% higher classification accuracy than
""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8\% higher than existing transfer and distant
transfer algorithms.

  Model","Forecasting the effect of COVID-19 is essential to design policies that may
prepare us to handle the pandemic. Many methods have already been proposed,
particularly, to forecast reported cases and deaths at country-level and
state-level. Many of these methods are based on traditional epidemiological
model which rely on simulations or Bayesian inference to simultaneously learn
many parameters at a time. This makes them prone to over-fitting and slow
execution. We propose an extension to our model SIkJ$\alpha$ to forecast deaths
and show that it can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic
process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast
linear regressions. We also present an evaluation of our method against seven
approaches currently being used by the CDC, based on their two weeks forecast
at various times during the pandemic. We demonstrate that our method achieves
better root mean squared error compared to these seven approaches during
majority of the evaluation period. Further, on a 2 core desktop machine, our
approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and
generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states

US counties ($>$ 3000) is 101.03s.

knowledge graphs (BioKG) that provide direct and precise biomedical knowledge.
In the context of COVID-19, this issue is even more necessary to be
highlighted. However, most BioKG construction inevitably includes numerous
conflicts and noises deriving from incorrect knowledge descriptions in
literature and defective information extraction techniques. Many studies have
demonstrated that reasoning upon the knowledge graph is effective in
eliminating such conflicts and noises. This paper proposes a method BioGRER to
improve the BioKG's quality, which comprehensively combines the knowledge graph
embedding and logic rules that support and negate triplets in the BioKG. In the
proposed model, the BioKG refinement problem is formulated as the probability
estimation for triplets in the BioKG. We employ the variational EM algorithm to
optimize knowledge graph embedding and logic rule inference alternately. In
this way, our model could combine efforts from both the knowledge graph
embedding and logic rules, leading to better results than using them alone. We
evaluate our model over a COVID-19 knowledge graph and obtain competitive
results.

down the economy while staying within the capacity of the healthcare system. We
base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which
takes into account different population groups and phases of the disease,
including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the
intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number
of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model
parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and
low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care
hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that
countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid
lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds
per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total
number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to
specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case
of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback
loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the
death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine
scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the
whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk
group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.

  Measures in the Presence of Infection Hotspots","Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest that infection hotspots, where a
single individual infects many others, play a key role in the transmission
dynamics of COVID-19. However, most of the existing epidemiological models fail
to capture this aspect by neither representing the sites visited by individuals
explicitly nor characterizing disease transmission as a function of individual
mobility patterns. In this work, we introduce a temporal point process modeling
framework that specifically represents visits to the sites where individuals
get in contact and infect each other. Under our model, the number of infections
caused by an infectious individual naturally emerges to be overdispersed. Using
an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how to apply Bayesian
optimization with longitudinal case data to estimate the transmission rate of
infectious individuals at the sites they visit and in their households.

locations from Bern, Switzerland showcase the flexibility of our framework. To
facilitate research and analyses of other cities and regions, we release an

  the spike glycoprotein with heparin","Heparin is administered intravenously as an anticoagulant to COVID-19
patients and via aerosol to treat other lung diseases. It has recently been
found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as it hinders attachment of
the virus to the host cell by binding to the virus spike glycoprotein. Here, we
describe molecular dynamics simulations and experiments to investigate how
heparin binds to the spike and the mechanism by which it exerts its antiviral
activity. The simulations show that heparin polyanionic chains can bind at
long, mostly positively charged patches on the spike, and thereby mask the
basic residues of the receptor binding domain and the basic S1/S2 site, which
is unique specific to SAR-CoV-2 and is important for furin-mediated spike
cleavage and the subsequent formation of its post-fusion conformation.
Experiments corroborated the simulation results by showing that heparin binds
the basic S1/S2 site of spike, inhibiting cleavage by furin. The simulations
show that heparin can act on the hinge region responsible for the motion of the
RBD between inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike. In
simulations of the closed spike, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal
domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders the opening. In simulations
of the open spike, heparin binds similarly but induces stabilization of the
hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Our results indicate that heparin is
able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by allosterically hindering binding to the
host cell receptor, by directly competing with binding to the host heparan
sulfate proteoglycan co-receptors, and by preventing spike cleavage by furin.
Furthermore, the simulations provide insights into how heparan sulphate
proteoglycans on the host cell can facilitate viral infection. Our results will
aid the rational optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral
therapy.

measures, introduced a significant increase in daily COVID-19 infections,
calling for a roll-back or substantial revisiting of these policies in many
states. The situation is suggestive of difficulties modeling the impact of
partial distancing/re-opening policies on future epidemic spread for purposes
of choosing safe alternatives. More specifically, one needs to understand the
impact of manipulating the availability of social interaction venues (e.g.,
schools, workplaces, and retail establishments) on virus spread. We introduce a
model, inspired by social networks research, that answers the above question.
Our model compartmentalizes interaction venues into categories we call mixing
domains, enabling one to predict COVID-19 contagion trends in different
geographic regions under different what if assumptions on partial re-opening of
individual domains. We apply our model to several highly impacted states
showing (i) how accurately it predicts the extent of current resurgence (from
available policy descriptions), and (ii) what alternatives might be more
effective at mitigating the second wave. We further compare policies that rely
on partial venue closure to policies that espouse wide-spread periodic testing
instead (i.e., in lieu of social distancing). Our models predict that the
benefits of (mandatory) testing out-shadow the benefits of partial venue
closure, suggesting that perhaps more efforts should be directed to such a
mitigation strategy.

the development of mathematical models for the simulation of the epidemic, and
of disease models generally. Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed
(SIR) compartmental framework, modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary
differential equations. Alternative formulations using a partial differential
equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also
been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful
descriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new
variation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The
dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to
incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a
natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering
advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the
need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed
individuals) to incorporate time delays. Here, we introduce a DDE epidemic
model in both an ordinary- and partial differential equation framework. We
present a series of mathematical results assessing the stability of the
formulation. We then perform several numerical experiments, validating both the

and decision making so that the end users can understand. The end users can be
domain experts, regulatory agencies, managers and executive board members, data
scientists, users that use AI, with or without awareness, or someone who is
affected by the decisions of an AI model. Chest CT has emerged as a valuable
tool for the clinical diagnostic and treatment management of the lung diseases
associated with COVID-19. AI can support rapid evaluation of CT scans to
differentiate COVID-19 findings from other lung diseases. However, how these AI
tools or deep learning algorithms reach such a decision and which are the most
influential features derived from these neural networks with typically deep
layers are not clear. The aim of this study is to propose and develop XAI
strategies for COVID-19 classification models with an investigation of
comparison. The results demonstrate promising quantification and qualitative
visualisations that can further enhance the clinician's understanding and
decision making with more granular information from the results given by the
learned XAI models.

  infection-dependent mitigation strategies","Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks may vary over time depending on the
societal response. Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social
distancing and the adoption of protective equipment aim precisely at reducing
transmission rates by reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects
of mitigation strategies on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission
rates that are influenced by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries
have been included in many variants of the classical SIR model. This class of
models is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the
population behavior has been affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid
distribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This
manuscript revisits a SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is
due to knowledge of infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes
individuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a
time-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through
a negative feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in
ecology and Michaelis-Menten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A
step-by-step derivation of the model is provided, together with an overview of
methods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback
structurally reduces the peak of infections. At the same time, feedback may
substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. Computational simulations
agree with the analytical predictions, and further suggest that infection peak
reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. If the
mitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter
is added to the SIR model, making it useful to illustrate the effects of
infection-dependent social distancing.

  from X-ray Images","Automatic and rapid screening of COVID-19 from the chest X-ray images has
become an urgent need in this pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in
2020. However, accurate and reliable screening of patients is a massive
challenge due to the discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in
X-ray images. In this paper, we design a new stacked convolutional neural
network model for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from the chest
X-ray images. We obtain different sub-models from the VGG19 and developed a
30-layered CNN model (named as CovNet30) during the training, and obtained
sub-models are stacked together using logistic regression. The proposed CNN
model combines the discriminating power of the different CNN`s sub-models and
classifies chest X-ray images into COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia classes. In
addition, we generate X-ray images dataset referred to as COVID19CXr, which
includes 2764 chest x-ray images of 1768 patients from the three publicly
available data repositories. The proposed stacked CNN achieves an accuracy of
92.74%, the sensitivity of 93.33%, PPV of 92.13%, and F1-score of 0.93 for the

  To Detect The Delayed Life-Threatening Hypoxaemia in COVID-19","Non-invasive ambulatory estimation of blood oxygen saturation has emerged as
an important clinical requirement to detect hypoxemia in the delayed
post-infective phase of COVID-19, where dangerous hypoxia may occur in the
absence of subjective breathlessness. This immediate clinical driver, combined
with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse
oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand
into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the
near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2
measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring,
and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the
conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we
found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites,
with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the
simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and
index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in
response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a
range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this
response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also
explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood
oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude,
and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in
conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to
temperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being
both convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for
continuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and
everyday-life settings.

COVID-19 crisis. Some of those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons
from mobile devices to build a record of proximate encounters between a pair of
device owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false positive
and re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's
difficulty in mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker
leveraging a moderately successful app or SDK with Bluetooth and location
access can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing systems at no
hardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app
or SDK installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a
good position to execute such attacks. We further present a novel attack, which
we call a biosurveillance attack, which allows the attacker to monitor the
exposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who does
not use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted
out of the system.
  Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize
precisely the behaviour of one such SDK that we found in a handful of
apps---but installed on more than one hundred million mobile devices. Its
behaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or
biosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with
minimal effort. We also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position
conducive to such attacks, by leveraging the lax logic for granting permissions
to apps in the Android framework: any app with some geolocation permission
could acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without
any additional user prompt. Finally we discuss motives for conducting such
attacks.

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first reported on in early December 2019 in
Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole
globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of
the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both
distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We
are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale
process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the
small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming
exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is
determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm
this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model,
describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our
theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within
a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how
well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite
the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and
spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats.

applications, including modeling of information or gossip spread in online
social networks, modeling of malware spread in communication networks, and the
most recent model of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the information disseminated is
accurate, for example, maximizing its distribution is desirable, whereas if it
is a rumor or a virus, its spread should be minimized. In this context, it is
very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize
propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained
momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of
nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality
measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this
study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of
nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model
and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes
according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the
Expected Value Estimation (EVE). We compared the performance of EVE, using
different SIR settings on real datasets, with that of many current well-known
centrality measures. The experimental studies demonstrated that the solution
quality (ranking capability) of EVE is superior to that of its competitors.

because of enormous socio-economic side-effects. An abrupt ending of lockdown
can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore,
carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post
upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of

fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet
and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase
in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth
of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown
phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools
for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical
intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed
SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear

evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian
regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at
the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly
reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of
the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the
spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics
counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on
the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the
intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results
suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide
uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of
infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.

mortality rate. Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies
about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological
knowledge, such as gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the
molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred
multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene
ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the
SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model
components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein
and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware
encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer
model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and
gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only
structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned
representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme
commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify
PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable
insights for advancing research on this new disease.

spike-and-slab prior that serves to regularize the inference and promote
sparsity. We investigated the empirical behavior of the proposed method on both

maximally correlate clinical variables and proteomic data for a better

incidence curve of COVID-19 during the first half of 2020, they face the
challenge of resuming their social and economic activity. The rapid airborne
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for active
containment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best
strategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist in
testing the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, and
treat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that better
describes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion
process that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential
contagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the
dynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We
develop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number
$R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and
suppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between the
infection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited
to symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not
bended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too,
the strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitative
results are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most important
indicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity to
reverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.

  Resolution Real-World Mobility Data","As countries look towards re-opening of economic activities amidst the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While
contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path
to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate
the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores
either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume
uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on
reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics.
Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign
relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging
high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals.
While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an
individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary
mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore,
we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility
behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via
simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain
spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide
useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.

transparency and liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the
external price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as
domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging
strategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this
risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk
Meter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior
embedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil,
Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the
financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in

sovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned

maximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the
Macro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We
then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network
behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose
the suitable market for in-vestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For
that purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies

by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a

mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media
sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated
lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media

counter-intuitive, simple and persistent communication on personal safety has
been effective and sustainable to induce cooperative behavioral adaptations.

reductions in air pollutant emissions. Quantifying these changes requires a
business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal
variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by
information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide
(NO$_{2}$) and ozone (O$_{3}$) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from
January through June 2020. Reductions in NO$_{2}$ correlate with timing and
intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected
cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On
average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from
February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but
concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the
business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been
more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that
the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months
of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic
total. The response of surface O$_{3}$ is complicated by competing influences
of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O$_{3}$ increased by up to
50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O$_{3}$
between February - June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a
flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone
due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a
reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on
season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O$_{3}$
forecasted if NO$_{x}$ emission reductions continue.

being counterfeited between the fabrication process and vendors' storage.
Hence, not only securing personal data is becoming a crucial obligation, but
also device verification is another challenge. To address biometrics
authentication and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) need to be put in
place to mitigate the security and privacy of the users. Among biometrics
modalities, Electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric has become popular as it
can authenticate patients and monitor the patient's vital signs. However,
researchers have recently started to study the vulnerabilities of the ECG
biometric systems and tried to address the issues of spoofing. Moreover, most
of the wearable is enabled with CPU and memories. Thus, volatile memory-based
(NVM) PUF can be easily placed in the device to avoid counterfeit. However,
many research challenged the unclonability characteristics of PUFs. Thus, a
careful study on these attacks should be sufficient to address the need. In
this paper, our aim is to provide a comprehensive study on the state-of-the-art
developments papers based on biometrics enabled hardware security.

  Infected Lung through Constraint-Based Modelling","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with
currently no effective antiviral drug except treatments for symptomatic
therapy. Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic
networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g.,
predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a
metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung
cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the
replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of
expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific
metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and
gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the
viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that
are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative
stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism,
and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative
disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug
combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug
repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug
candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being

  one-shot non-pharmaceutical intervention in a hybrid epidemic model","Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19,
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates
without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate
spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different
NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each
country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of
policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to
further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well
as numerical simulations. In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR
model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that
the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite
time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It
was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and
the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The
analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the
peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. This study provides
quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and
the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests
the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are
necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments
as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.

  Imbalanced Data and its Application to COVID-19 X-Ray Classification","We propose a highly data-efficient classification and active learning
framework for classifying chest X-rays. It is based on (1) unsupervised
representation learning of a Convolutional Neural Network and (2) the Gaussian
Process method. The unsupervised representation learning employs
self-supervision that does not require class labels, and the learned features
are proven to achieve label-efficient classification. GP is a kernel-based
Bayesian approach that also leads to data-efficient predictions with the added
benefit of estimating each decision's uncertainty. Our novel framework combines
these two elements in sequence to achieve highly data and label efficient
classifications. Moreover, both elements are less sensitive to the prevalent
and challenging class imbalance issue, thanks to the (1) feature learned
without labels and (2) the Bayesian nature of GP. The GP-provided uncertainty
estimates enable active learning by ranking samples based on the uncertainty
and selectively labeling samples showing higher uncertainty. We apply this
novel combination to the data-deficient and severely imbalanced case of
COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. We demonstrate that only $\sim 10\%$ of
the labeled data is needed to reach the accuracy from training all available
labels. Its application to the COVID-19 data in a fully supervised
classification scenario shows that our model, with a generic ResNet backbone,
outperforms (COVID-19 case by 4\%) the state-of-the-art model with a highly
tuned architecture. Our model architecture and proposed framework are general
and straightforward to apply to a broader class of datasets, with expected
success.

severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 that
emerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,
which emerged in 2012. Both of these previous epidemics were controlled fairly
rapidly through public health measures, and no vaccines or robust therapeutic
interventions were identified. However, previous insights into the immune
response to coronaviruses gained during the outbreaks of severe acute

possible therapeutic approaches being initiated early on in the pandemic. As a
result, a small number of therapeutics have already been authorized by

  the COVID-19 pandemic","As of November 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in
many countries. In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late
spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew
throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of
the effective reproduction numbers ${\cal R}(t)$ for each country by
integrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based
on the estimated ${\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.
The result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries
respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we
extend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$
of new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social
response is on the form $d_t{\cal R}=-\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold
for response. The response rate $\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or
above this threshold, on three parameters $\nu_1,\;\nu_2,\,\nu_3,$, and on $t$.
When $X<X^*$, $\nu= \nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when
the incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\nu=\nu_2\exp{(-\nu_3t)}$, models the
impact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\nu_3$
represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time
passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19
epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters
$\nu_1,\,\nu_2,\,\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\cal R}_0$, for
different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social
responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave
in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during
the summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the
fall.

due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the important problem of forecasting daily
deaths and cumulative deaths, this paper examines the construction of
prediction regions or intervals under the Poisson regression model and for an
over-dispersed Poisson regression model. For the Poisson regression model,
several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared
through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of
forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to
COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened,
daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by
June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data
relative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression
model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival
Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The
Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson
regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion
parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number
of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is
presented. Finally, the paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and
mentions open research problems, as well as the dangers and pitfalls when
forecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic where events, both

  using Deep Learning Methods","Covid-19 has been started in the year 2019 and imposed restrictions in many
countries and costs organisations and governments. Predicting the number of new
cases and deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting the
costs and facilities required in the future. The purpose of this study is to
predict new cases and death rate for seven days ahead. Deep learning methods
and statistical analysis model these predictions for 100 days. Six different
deep learning methods are examined for the data adopted from the WHO website.
Three methods are known as LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The
bi-directional mode is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of
new cases and new deaths for Australia and Iran countries. This study is novel
as it attempts to implement the mentioned three deep learning methods, along
with their Bi-directional models, to predict COVID-19 new cases and new death
rate time series. All methods are compared, and results are presented. The
results are examined in the form of graphs and statistical analyses. The
results show that the Bi-directional models have lower error than other models.
Several error evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and
finally, the superiority of Bi-directional methods are determined. The
experimental results and statistical test show on datasets to compare the
proposed method with other baseline methods. This research could be useful for
organisations working against COVID-19 and determining their long-term plans.

it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer

suffering from it. These are based on the number of excess deaths attributed
either directly or indirectly to the epidemic. Unfortunately the data on which
such comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This article
discusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely
accurate and delayed by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office
of National Statistics in the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and
the Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article is taken from
these three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of
deaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to
country. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years,
in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11
years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on
the timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics
and heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline
defined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors
can be operationalized by taking say the 10\% quantile of the number of deaths.
This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It
therefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries.
The article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between
countries. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics by their timing,
that is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the
height of the maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered.

  filter for accurate detection of COVID-19 patients using X-ray images","The coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently the most common contagious disease
which is prevalent all over the world. The main challenge of this disease is
the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one
person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis
system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to
prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed
tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to
obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a
fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and
Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray
image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel
filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep
learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation
strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our
results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filtering (CNN-SVM+Sobel)
achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.02% in accurate detection of
COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN.
Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained
network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases
and obtained the highest performance. Hence, our developed model is ready for

tradeoffs between economic and health-related outcomes during the COVID-19
pandemic. Despite evidence of the effectiveness of government-mandated
restrictions mitigating the spread of contagion, these orders are stigmatized
due to undesirable economic consequences. This tradeoff resulted in state
governments employing mandates at widely different ways. We compare the
different policies states implemented during periods of restriction
(""lockdown"") and reopening with indicators of COVID-19 spread and consumer card
spending at each state during the first ""wave"" of the pandemic in the U.S.
between March and August 2020. We find that while some states enacted reopening
decisions when the incidence rate of COVID-19 was minimal or sustained in its
relative decline, other states relaxed socioeconomic restrictions near their
highest incidence and prevalence rates experienced so far. Nevertheless, all
states experienced similar trends in consumer card spending recovery, which was
strongly correlated with reopening policies following the lockdowns and
relatively independent from COVID-19 incidence rates at the time. Our findings
suggest that consumer card spending patterns can be attributed to government
mandates rather than COVID-19 incidence in the states. This result highlights
the important role of state policies in minimizing health impacts while
promoting economic recovery and helps planning effective interventions in
subsequent waves and immunization efforts.

arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can
lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus
the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are
favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune
phase. As usage decreases there is a novel ""contact tracing"" phase transition
to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for

organizations face when tasked with equitable and efficient rationing of a
social good among agents whose needs (demands) realize sequentially and are
possibly correlated. To better achieve their dual aims of equity and efficiency
in such contexts, social planners intend to maximize the minimum fill rate
across agents, where each agent's fill rate must be irrevocably decided upon
its arrival. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence of demands, we establish
upper bounds on both the expected minimum fill rate (ex-post fairness) and the
minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness) achievable by any policy. Our
bounds are parameterized by the number of agents and the expected
demand-to-supply ratio, and they shed light on the limits of attaining equity
in dynamic rationing. Further, we show that for any set of parameters, a simple
adaptive policy of projected proportional allocation achieves the best possible
fairness guarantee, ex post as well as ex ante. Our policy is transparent and
easy to implement; yet despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that this policy
provides significant improvement over the class of non-adaptive
target-fill-rate policies. We obtain the performance guarantees of (i) our
proposed adaptive policy by inductively designing lower-bound functions on its
corresponding value-to-go, and (ii) the optimal target-fill-rate policy by
establishing an intriguing connection to a monopoly-pricing optimization
problem. We complement our theoretical developments with a numerical study

spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the epidemic spread in
European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the
USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America
and South Asia. It was the fifth wave that led to the spread of the coronavirus
epidemic COVID-19 entering a new phase, with an increase in the number of
infected more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the studied countries and
the world, for each of the superposition waves, the wave capacities and growth
indicators were calculated. The local peaks of the waves and their ending times
are determined. It was the fifth wave that led to the fact that COVID-19 spread
is entering a new phase, with the increase in the number of infected people
being more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the countries being examined
and for the whole world, for each of the superposition waves we calculated the
waves capacities and index of infected people growth.

  data of China","During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also
challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up
actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a
reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of
various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat
of COVID-19 pandemics now.
  Based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported
during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast
ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference
methods and five dynamical models. We highlight the significance of a well
balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting,
as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike
information criterion, root mean square error and robustness index to evaluate
various epidemic models/methods.
  Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a
crucial role in forecasting. We further notice the Logistic function steadily
underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an
overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time
dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective
reproduction number into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in
the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential
growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the
inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast.
Towards the ODE models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are shown to be suitable
for modeling the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the

  the Three Major Metropolitan Areas of Japan","Unlike the lockdown measures taken in some countries or cities, the Japanese
government declared a ""State of Emergency"" (SOE) under which people were only
requested to reduce their contact with other people by at least 70 %, while
some local governments also implemented their own mobility-reduction measures
that had no legal basis. The effects of these measures are still unclear. Thus,
in this study, we investigate changes in travel patterns in response to the
COVID-19 outbreak and related policy measures in Japan using longitudinal
aggregated mobile phone data. Specifically, we consider daily travel patterns
as networks and analyze their structural changes by applying a framework for
analyzing temporal networks used in network science. The cluster analysis with
the network similarity measures across different dates showed that there are
six main types of mobility patterns in the three major metropolitan areas of
Japan: (I) weekends and holidays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (II) weekdays
prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (III) weekends and holidays before and after
the SOE, (IV) weekdays before and after the SOE, (V) weekends and holidays
during the SOE, and (VI) weekdays during the SOE. It was also found that travel
patterns might have started to change from March 2020, when most schools were
closed, and that the mobility patterns after the SOE returned to those prior to
the SOE. Interestingly, we found that after the lifting of the SOE, travel
patterns remained similar to those during the SOE for a few days, suggesting
the possibility that self-restraint continued after the lifting of the SOE.
Moreover, in the case of the Nagoya metropolitan area, we found that people
voluntarily changed their travel patterns when the number of cases increased.

splittings and different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity
fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned
classes of matrices. In such a case, $K$-monotonicity is sufficient for the
convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a
proper cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage
iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature.
Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in
standard proper cone setting, i.e., $K=\mathbb{R}^n_+$), is open. To this end,
we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak
regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some
sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a
two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some
comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the
stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a $K$-weak regular splitting

warning system that predicts the locations of outbreaks is of crucial
importance. Studies have shown the effectiveness of using large-scale mobility
data to monitor the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,
lockdowns) through population density analysis. However, predicting the
locations of potential outbreak occurrence is difficult using mobility data
alone. Meanwhile, web search queries have been shown to be good predictors of
the disease spread. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset of human
mobility trajectories (GPS traces) and web search queries with common user
identifiers (> 450K users), to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations beforehand.
More specifically, web search query analysis is conducted to identify users
with high risk of COVID-19 contraction, and social contact analysis was further
performed on the mobility patterns of these users to quantify the risk of an
outbreak. Our approach is empirically tested using data collected from users in
Tokyo, Japan. We show that by integrating COVID-19 related web search query
analytics with social contact networks, we are able to predict COVID-19 hotspot
locations 1-2 weeks beforehand, compared to just using social contact indexes
or web search data analysis. This study proposes a novel method that can be
used in early warning systems for disease outbreak hotspots, which can assist
government agencies to prepare effective strategies to prevent further disease
spread.

emergency of international concern. During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,
people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the risk of exposure to the
coronavirus. Experimental data, however, show that infected aerosols and
droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We
propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is
proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our
puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm
air} < 4.0$, where $\rho_P$ and $\rho_{\rm air}$ are the average density of the
puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold
or warmth. We also demonstrate that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended
for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its
coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.

  establishment, initial growth rate, and infection cluster size at first
  detection","Emerging epidemics and local infection clusters are initially prone to
stochastic effects that can substantially impact the epidemic trajectory. While
numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established
epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are
comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results, and derive
new results to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by
a single infected individual. We cover the probability of establishment of an
epidemic as a function of the distribution of secondary infections, the
expectation of epidemic size as a function of time, and the convergence to a
deterministic exponential regime. Stochasticity systematically accelerates the
initial growth of an epidemic, because epidemics that do not get extinct have
faster initial growth on average. This also affects the long-term epidemic
growth by increasing the cumulative size by a constant factor. Applying these
results, we compute the probability distribution of the first detection time of
an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on the testing effort
(assumed to be constant in time), and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of
concern B.1.1.7, detected in September 2020, first appeared in the United
Kingdom early August 2020. We estimate a minimal testing frequency to detect
clusters before they exceed a certain threshold size, and we compute the
detection rate of infected individuals during a single mass testing effort. For
example, in a COVID-19-parameterized model with an effective reproduction
number R=1.1, a fraction 1.3% of a population needs to be randomly tested each
day for cluster size to not exceed 30 infected individuals. These results
improve our theoretical understanding of early epidemics and are useful for the
study and control of local infectious disease clusters.

by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of
the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect
diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are
analyzed. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is derived. When $R_{0}<1$, the
disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable.
When $R_{0}>1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some
conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of
disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in
the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual
behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is
proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United
States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for
the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the

cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the

symptoms of the disease increase so much they lead to the death of the
patients. The disease may be asymptomatic in some patients in the early stages,
which can lead to increased transmission of the disease to others. Many studies
have tried to use medical imaging for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This study

essential points of the collected studies were summarised. The contribution of
this study is four-fold: 1) to use as a tutorial of the field for both
clinicians and technologists, 2) to comprehensively review the characteristics
of COVID-19 as presented in medical images, 3) to examine automated artificial

the method used, 4) to express the research limitations in this field and the
methods used to overcome them. COVID-19 reveals signs in medical images can be
used for early diagnosis of the disease even in asymptomatic patients. Using
automated machine learning-based methods can diagnose the disease with high
accuracy from medical images and reduce time, cost and error of diagnostic

densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling
for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship
between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social
capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection
rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus
infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.

  Coverage with Mobility Data for COVID-19 Policy","Anonymized smartphone-based mobility data has been widely adopted in devising
and evaluating COVID-19 response strategies such as the targeting of public
health resources. Yet little attention has been paid to measurement validity
and demographic bias, due in part to the lack of documentation about which
users are represented as well as the challenge of obtaining ground truth data
on unique visits and demographics. We illustrate how linking large-scale
administrative data can enable auditing mobility data for bias in the absence
of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show
that linking voter roll data -- containing individual-level voter turnout for
specific voting locations along with race and age -- can facilitate the
construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. These tests illuminate a
sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older
and non-white voters are less likely to be captured by mobility data. We show
that allocating public health resources based on such mobility data could
disproportionately harm high-risk elderly and minority groups.

  among Disabled People and Their Caregivers","A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is through the limiting of
in-person contacts. However, for the many disabled people who live in the
community and require caregivers to assist them with activities of daily
living, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible. We seek to determine
which interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and their
caregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with a
compartmental model on a network. The networks incorporate heterogeneity in the
risks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening
measures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers,
disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Among these
groups, we find the probability of becoming infected is highest for caregivers
and second highest for disabled people. Our analysis of the network structure
illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality among
the four groups. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all
groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- particularly
reduce cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which group
most effectively spreads COVID-19 by seeding infections in a subset of each
group and then comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads.
We find that caregivers are the most effective spreaders of COVID-19. We then
test where limited vaccine doses could be used most effectively and we find
that vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating
the general population, essential workers, or the disabled population itself.
Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing,
contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the
exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.

worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008, and the COVID-19 has been
widely blamed on the stock market crashes. In this study, we applied the
log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time
series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market
crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both
developed and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ,
FTSE, DAX, NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. In order to effectively
distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash, we proposed using the
LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the
apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by
the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the
price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300,
BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed
endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes
for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic
instability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as
the COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock
market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not
been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE,
NIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are
exogenous, stemming from external shocks. The novel classification method of
crash types proposed in this study can also be used to analyze regime changes
of any price trajectories in global financial markets.

problem is especially acute in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hence,
any simple, cheap and flexible means of evaluating the incidence and evolution

useful. In this paper, we propose a technique based on (anonymous) surveys in
which participants report on the health status of their contacts. This indirect
reporting technique, known in the literature as network scale-up method,
preserves the privacy of the participants and their contacts, and collects
information from a larger fraction of the population (as compared to individual
surveys). This technique has been deployed in the CoronaSurveys project, which
has been collecting reports for the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two months.
Results obtained by CoronaSurveys show the power and flexibility of the
approach, suggesting that it could be an inexpensive and powerful tool for
LMICs.

they can spread the disease much longer, and this increases the COVID-19 $R_0$

countries correspond to the simulations with commonly used parameters based on
clinical characteristics of the disease COVID-19, but $R_0$ is around three
times bigger if the asymptomatic cohort is taken into account. Many voices in

care unit (ICU) capacity. Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis
of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both
lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based
on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various
quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off
between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with
the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as
an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong
lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a
short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to
normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal
scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is
released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures
with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on
detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are
introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing
can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals
to be more moderate.

reported at the end of 2019. As a consequence of its highly infectious nature,
countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control
its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have
done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop
medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a
great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters
in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict
the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course
of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the
determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the
infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic
wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily
fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020
are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each
country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error
are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean
duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the
spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case).
Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the
inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly
estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by
comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were
realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were

severe physical afflictions through their use in assistive systems. Common
methods of achieving this is via Motor Imagery (MI), which maps brain signals
to code for certain commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is preferred for
recording brain signal data on account of it being non-invasive. Despite their
potential utility, MI-BCI systems are yet confined to research labs. A major
cause for this is lack of robustness of such systems. As hypothesized by two
teams during Cybathlon 2016, a particular source of the system's vulnerability
is the sharp change in the subject's state of emotional arousal. This work aims
towards making MI-BCI systems resilient to such emotional perturbations. To do
so, subjects are exposed to high and low arousal-inducing virtual reality (VR)
environments before recording EEG data. The advent of COVID-19 compelled us to
modify our methodology. Instead of training machine learning algorithms to
classify emotional arousal, we opt for classifying subjects that serve as proxy
for each state. Additionally, MI models are trained for each subject instead of
each arousal state. As training subjects to use MI-BCI can be an arduous and
time-consuming process, reducing this variability and increasing robustness can
considerably accelerate the acceptance and adoption of assistive technologies
powered by BCI.

  preventing respiratory infections has been underestimated","Face masks have been widely used as a protective measure against COVID-19.
However, pre-pandemic empirical studies have produced mixed statistical results
on the effectiveness of masks against respiratory viruses. The implications of
the studies' recognized limitations have not been quantitatively and
statistically analyzed, leading to confusion regarding the effectiveness of
masks. Such confusion may have contributed to organizations such as the WHO and
CDC initially not recommending that the general public wear masks. Here we show
that when the adherence to mask-usage guidelines is taken into account, the
empirical evidence indicates that masks prevent disease transmission: all
studies we analyzed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were
under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the
studies in question would still have been unlikely to find a statistically
significant effect. We also provide a framework for understanding the effect of
masks on the probability of infection for single and repeated exposures. The
framework demonstrates that more frequently wearing a mask provides
super-linearly compounding protection, as does both the susceptible and
infected individual wearing a mask. This work shows (1) that both theoretical
and empirical evidence is consistent with masks protecting against respiratory
infections and (2) that nonlinear effects and statistical considerations
regarding the percentage of exposures for which masks are worn must be taken
into account when designing empirical studies and interpreting their results.

  Malignancy Prediction","Lung diseases including infections such as Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19), together with Lung Cancer are significantly widespread
and are, typically, considered life threatening. In particular, lung cancer is
among the most common and deadliest cancers with a low 5-year survival rate.
Timely diagnosis of lung cancer is, therefore, of paramount importance as it
can save countless lives. In this regard, deep learning radiomics solutions
have the promise of extracting the most useful features on their own in an
end-to-end fashion without having access to the annotated boundaries. Among
different deep learning models, Capsule Networks are proposed to overcome
shortcomings of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as their inability
to recognize detailed spatial relations. Capsule networks have so far shown
satisfying performance in medical imaging problems. Capitalizing on their
success, in this study, we propose a novel capsule network-based mixture of
experts, referred to as the MIXCAPS. The proposed MIXCAPS architecture takes
advantage of not only the capsule network's capabilities to handle small
datasets, but also automatically splitting dataset through a convolutional
gating network. MIXCAPS enables capsule network experts to specialize on
different subsets of the data. Our results show that MIXCAPS outperforms a
single capsule network and a mixture of CNNs, with an accuracy of 92.88%,
sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 92.3% and area under the curve of 0.963.
Our experiments also show that there is a relation between the gate outputs and
a couple of hand-crafted features, illustrating explainable nature of the
proposed MIXCAPS. To further evaluate generalization capabilities of the
proposed MIXCAPS architecture, additional experiments on a brain tumor dataset
are performed showing potentials of MIXCAPS for detection of tumors related to
other organs.

introduced in countries worldwide to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many
governments have begun to implement lockdown exit strategies that allow
restrictions to be relaxed while attempting to control the risk of a surge in
cases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding
interventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the
face of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from
the Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May
2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to
governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if
answered, will allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different
exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate
the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap
requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and
policy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i) improve estimation of key
epidemiological parameters; ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in
populations; iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in
Low-to-Middle-Income countries. This will provide important information for
planning exit strategies that balance socio-economic benefits with public
health.

  cases","Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people
express emotions or sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as
natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a
catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as
depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. During the rise
of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock downs, people have been expressing their
sentiments in social media which can provide a deep understanding of how people
physiologically react to catastrophic events. In this paper, we use deep
learning based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent
neural networks for sentiment analysis on Twitter with a focus of rise of novel
cases in India. We use the LSTM model with a global vector (GloVe) for word
representation in building a language model. We review the sentiments expressed
for selective months covering the major peak of new cases in 2020. We present a
framework that focuses on multi-label sentiment classification using LSTM model
and GloVe embedding, where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once.
Our results show that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high
levels of optimism during the rise of the COVID-19 cases in India. We find that
the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak of new cases. We
find that the optimistic and joking tweets mostly dominated the monthly tweets
and there was a much lower number of negative sentiments expressed. This could
imply that the majority were generally positive and some annoyed towards the
way the pandemic was handled by the authorities as their peak was reached.

crisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting people's
concerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely
acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a
social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive information in
social media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient
manually labeled data is in the absence of public health emergencies, e.g.,

Convolutional Network and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with
Concern Graph. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the
regional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which
not only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high

labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model
by using both manually labeled tweets and automatically labeled tweets. The
experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-art models

  Continuous Time Picture","Typically, mathematical simulation studies on COVID-19 pandemic forecasting
are based on deterministic differential equations which assume that both the
number ($n$) of individuals in various epidemiological classes and the time
($t$) on which they depend are quantities that vary continuous. This picture
contrasts with the discrete representation of $n$ and $t$ underlying the real
epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for
which a description based on finite difference equations would be more
adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a
quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time
description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the
epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position
$T_{1/2}^{c}$ obtained within the continuous time representation is
systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position
$T_{1/2}^{d}$ predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather
counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift $\tau \equiv
T_{1/2}^{c} - T_{1/2}^{d} < 0$ is basically insensitive to changes in infection
rate $\kappa$. For a broad range of $\kappa$ values deduced from COVID-19 data
at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we
found a rather robust estimate $\tau \simeq -2.65\,\mbox{day}^{-1}$. Being
obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results
apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real
system.

limited access of resources (both hardware and trained personnel) and
decontamination considerations, CT may not be ideal for triaging suspected

existing solutions by industry and academic communities, and demonstrates a
functional AI model to triage by inferencing using a single x-ray image, while
the deep-learning model is trained using both X-ray and CT data. We report on
how such a multi-modal training improves the solution compared to X-ray only
training. The multi-modal solution increases the AUC (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve) from 0.89 to 0.93 and also positively impacts
the Dice coefficient (0.59 to 0.62) for localizing the pathology. To the best
our knowledge, it is the first X-ray solution by leveraging multi-modal

  Locations to Identify Susceptible Infections in Simulated Epidemics","Amidst an increasing number of infected cases during the Covid-19 pandemic,
it is essential to trace, as early as possible, the susceptible people who
might have been infected by the disease due to their close proximity with
people who were tested positive for the virus. This early contact tracing is
likely to limit the rate of spread of the infection within a locality. In this
paper, we investigate how effectively and efficiently can such a list of
susceptible people be found given a list of infected persons and their
locations. To address this problem from an information retrieval (search)
perspective, we represent the location of each person at each time instant as a
point in a vector space. By using the locations of the given list of infected
persons as queries, we investigate the feasibility of applying approximate
nearest neighbour (ANN) based indexing and retrieval approaches to obtain a
list of top-k suspected users in real-time. Since leveraging information from
true user location data can lead to security and privacy concerns, we also
investigate what effects does distance-preserving encoding methods have on the
effectiveness of the ANN methods. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that the top-k retrieved lists of susceptible users
retrieved with existing ANN approaches (KD-tree and HNSW) yield satisfactory
precision and recall values, thus indicating that ANN approaches can
potentially be applied in practice to facilitate real-time contact tracing even
under the presence of imposed privacy constraints.

  Tracing","Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many governments suspended outdoor
activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had severe impact on the economy and
peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective
contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models
suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact
tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital
contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple
Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to
supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn
scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt
to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many
digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit
the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this
paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks,
specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving
digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers
to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we
showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks
on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our example DoS attacks
showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within

access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to

a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the
elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially

mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein. Additionally, we
use 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics.
Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for
the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics,
biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of 462
mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of S
protein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody
therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 vaccine escape mutants is identified,
while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that
about 65\% existing RBD mutations, including those variants recently found in
the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, are binding-strengthen mutations,
resulting in more infectious COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparity
between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFE strengthening and
weakening of the bindings with antibodies and ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2
is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the human
immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery implies
the vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Our
predictions were validated by comparison with more than 1,400 deep mutations on

user-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and being
developed, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of both
quality and quantity, which can be overwhelming to the users. Understanding the
testing landscape through a digital lens will give a clear insight into the
multiple challenges that we face including data privacy, cost, and
miscommunication. It is the destiny of digitalization to navigate testing for
COVID-19. Block-chain based systems can be used for privacy preservation and
ensuring ownership of the data to remain with the user. Another solution
involves having digital health passports with relevant and correct information.
In this early draft, we summarize the challenges and propose possible solutions
to address the same.

restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France,
Germany, Sweden, and the whole of Europe are also included. The analysis of a

significant, especially in terms of increased variability of latency. In Italy
we observed that the standard deviation of the average additional delay -- the
additional time with respect to the minimum delay of the paths in the region --

Similarly, in Italy, packet loss is ~2-3 times as much as before the pandemic.
The impact is not negligible also for the other countries and for the whole of

explicitly in response to COVID-19 from 24 Jan, 2020, to 23 Jan, 2021, in 48
countries. The analysis was guided by four overarching questions: 1) What were
robots used for in the COVID-19 response? 2) When were they used? 3) How did
different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics
influence a country's innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The
findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work
domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the
country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of
their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the
data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to
NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note
that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly
modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases
constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries
with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often
and for broader purposes. Finally, the dataset and analysis produces a broad
set of implications that warrant further study and investigation. The results
from this analysis are expected to be of value to the robotics and robotics
policy community in preparing robots for rapid insertion into future disasters.

Conditioning on the propensity score allows one to replicate the design of a
randomized controlled trial, conditional on observed covariates. Extensions
include the g-computation approach, which is less frequently applied, in
particular in clinical studies. Moreover, doubly robust estimators provide
additional advantages. Here, we investigate the properties of propensity score

pandemic such as the COVID-19. In order to achieve efficient and scalable
contact-tracing in real time, digital devices can play an important role. While
a lot of attention has been paid to analyzing the privacy and ethical risks of
the associated mobile applications, so far much less research has been devoted
to optimizing their performance and assessing their impact on the mitigation of
the epidemic. We develop Bayesian inference methods to estimate the risk that
an individual is infected. This inference is based on the list of his recent
contacts and their own risk levels, as well as personal information such as
results of tests or presence of syndromes. We propose to use probabilistic risk
estimation in order to optimize testing and quarantining strategies for the
control of an epidemic. Our results show that in some range of epidemic
spreading (typically when the manual tracing of all contacts of infected people
becomes practically impossible, but before the fraction of infected people
reaches the scale where a lock-down becomes unavoidable), this inference of
individuals at risk could be an efficient way to mitigate the epidemic. Our
approaches translate into fully distributed algorithms that only require
communication between individuals who have recently been in contact. Such
communication may be encrypted and anonymized and thus compatible with privacy
preserving standards. We conclude that probabilistic risk estimation is capable
to enhance performance of digital contact tracing and should be considered in
the currently developed mobile applications.

interplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, and
detection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces. More generally, our

  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by
various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2
causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social
distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this
end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized
(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and
analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous
complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is
necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is
insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with
the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy
at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees
to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that
stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the
outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for
the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus
reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find
that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the
adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a
region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an
understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our
investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into
understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak
infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to
understand and control over an extended period of time.

  Retrieval Systems for COVID-19 Literature","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a tremendous need for access to the
latest scientific information, primarily through the use of text mining and
search tools. This has led to both corpora for biomedical articles related to
COVID-19 (such as the CORD-19 corpus (Wang et al., 2020)) as well as search
engines to query such data. While most research in search engines is performed
in the academic field of information retrieval (IR), most academic search
engines$\unicode{x2013}$though rigorously evaluated$\unicode{x2013}$are
sparsely utilized, while major commercial web search engines (e.g., Google,
Bing) dominate. This relates to COVID-19 because it can be expected that
commercial search engines deployed for the pandemic will gain much higher
traction than those produced in academic labs, and thus leads to questions
about the empirical performance of these search tools. This paper seeks to
empirically evaluate two such commercial search engines for COVID-19, produced
by Google and Amazon, in comparison to the more academic prototypes evaluated
in the context of the TREC-COVID track (Roberts et al., 2020). We performed
several steps to reduce bias in the available manual judgments in order to
ensure a fair comparison of the two systems with those submitted to TREC-COVID.
We find that the top-performing system from TREC-COVID on bpref metric
performed the best among the different systems evaluated in this study on all
the metrics. This has implications for developing biomedical retrieval systems
for future health crises as well as trust in popular health search engines.

unseen countries, and their sensitivity to unobserved factors. Models that
account for noise in disease transmission compare favourably. We further

that previously published results are remarkably robust across these variables.
Finally, we mathematically ground the interpretation of NPI effectiveness

The major landmarks assessed by clinicians for triaging using LUS are pleura, A

applications of audible coding of matter include material design by
manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to
broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a
physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as

decades. There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to
information retrieval tools. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process
the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual
re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous
literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used
as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each
printing command according to its structural function in the page. This
approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more
fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual
methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure
resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more
naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing
commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and
it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to
deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through
extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature
engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average
F1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we
achieved is currently served in production environments on our Corpus
Conversion Service (CCS), which was presented at KDD18 (arXiv:1806.02284). This
model enhances the capabilities of CCS significantly, as it eliminates the need
for human annotated label ground-truth for every unseen document layout. This
proved particularly useful when applied to a huge corpus of PDF articles
related to COVID-19.

been dedicated to developing smartphone-based contact tracing apps in order to

These applications while potentially useful, present significant adoption,

  We propose ACDC-Tracing, a simpler, anonymous, voucher-based contact tracing
solution that relies on peoples' knowledge of their own close contacts. People
who test positive are given an anonymous voucher which they can share with a
limited number of people whom they think they might be infected. The recipients
can use this voucher to book a COVID-19 test and can receive their test results
without ever revealing their identity. People receiving positive result are
given vouchers to further backtrack the path of infection.
  This is a fully anonymous solution which does not require any sharing of
location data, Bluetooth, or having an app installed on people's mobile device.
Moreover, ACDC-Tracing can be tested for effectiveness at a small scale without
requiring adoption by the entire population, which would enable acquiring fast
evidence about its efficacy and scalability. Finally, it is compatible with and
complementary to alternative approaches to contact tracing.

actions are grandly slowed down by the shortage of testing kits. Governments
have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become
more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency
measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to
100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program.
However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are
still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists
in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples
once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost.
However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which
patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected
patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify
them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy.
Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine
learning or clinical examinations. The resulting algorithms, which can be
interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and
quite surprising. They are patent-free. Co-authors are listed in alphabetical

was widely available in Japan and the medical system did not suffer a collapse,
making accurate comparisons between prefectures possible. For the 16
prefectures included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases
exceeding ten, the number of daily confirmed cases follow bell-shape or
log-normal distribution in most prefectures. A good correlation was observed
between the spread and decay durations. However, some exceptions were observed
in areas where travelers returned from foreign countries, which were defined as
the origins of infection clusters. Excluding these prefectures, the population
density was shown to be a major factor affecting the spread and decay patterns,
with R2=0.39 (p<0.05) and 0.42 (p<0.05), respectively, approximately
corresponding to social distancing. The maximum absolute humidity was found to
affect the decay duration normalized by the population density (R2>0.36, p
<0.05). Our findings indicate that the estimated pandemic spread duration,
based on the multivariate analysis of maximum absolute humidity, ambient
temperature, and population density (adjusted R2=0.53, p-value<0.05), could
prove useful for intervention planning during potential future pandemics,

  Interhuman Airborne Pathogen Transmission","Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria play a vital role in human life, since
they cause infectious diseases which can lead to epidemics. Recent coronavirus
disease 2019 epidemic has shown that taking effective prevention measures such
as wearing masks are important to reduce the human deaths and side effects of
the epidemic. It is therefore requisite to accurately model the spread of
infectious diseases whose one of the most crucial routes of transmission is
airborne transmission. The transmission models in the literature are proposed
independently from each other, at different scales and by the researchers from
various disciplines. Thus, there is a need to merge all these research
attempts. To this end, we propose a communication engineering approach that
melts different disciplines such as epidemiology, biology, medicine, and fluid
dynamics in the same pot to model airborne pathogen transmission among humans.
In this approach, we introduce the concept of mobile human ad hoc networks
(MoHANETs). This concept exploits the similarity of airborne
transmission-driven human groups with mobile ad hoc networks and uses molecular
communication as the enabling paradigm. The aim of this article is to present a
unified framework using communication engineering, and to highlight future
research directions for modeling the spread of infectious diseases among humans
through airborne pathogen transmission. In this article, we first review the
airborne pathogen transmission mechanisms. Then, the MoHANET is given with a
layered structure. In these layers, the infectious human emitting
pathogen-laden droplets through air and the exposed human to these droplets are
considered as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Moreover, the
experimental methods for the proposed approach are reviewed and discussed.

intense coexistence increases domestic violence, while social distancing
measures may have prevented access to public services and networks,
information, and help. We propose an agent-based model (ABM), called VIDA, to
illustrate and examine multi-causal factors that influence events that generate
violence. A central part of the model is the multi-causal stress indicator,
created as a probability trigger of domestic violence occurring within the
family environment. Two experimental design tests were performed: (a) absence
or presence of the deterrence system of domestic violence against women and (b)
measures to increase social distancing. VIDA presents comparative results for
metropolitan regions and neighbourhoods considered in the experiments. Results
suggest that social distancing measures, particularly those encouraging staying
at home, may have increased domestic violence against women by about 10%. VIDA
suggests further that more populated areas have comparatively fewer cases per
hundred thousand women than less populous capitals or rural areas of urban
concentrations. This paper contributes to the literature by formalising, to the
best of our knowledge, the first model of domestic violence through agent-based
modelling, using empirical detailed socioeconomic, demographic, educational,

  Quantitative Features from Chest CT Images","Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool
for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase
rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may
lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest
CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age
45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of
COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross
validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of
quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to
the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the
right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left
lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment
(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.
Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity
of COVID-19, were revealed.

study, were used to evaluate the binding and inhibition capacity of an
antiviral such as remdesivir on the NSP-12 protein of SARS-CoV, a polymerase
that is key in the replication of the SARS-COV virus. The results are then
compared with a docking analysis of two natural products (Alpha-Bisabolol and
betalain) with SARS-CoV protein, in order to find more candidates for COVID-19
virus replication inhibitors. in addition to increasing studies that help
explain the specific mechanisms of the SARs-CoV-2 virus, remembering that we
will have to live with the virus for an indefinite time from now on. Finally,
natural products such as betalains may have inhibitory effects of a small order
but in conjunction with other synergistic active ingredients they may increase
their inhibition effect on NSP-12 protein of SARS-CoV.

activities including the way people communicate, move, provision themselves, or
organize leisure activities. Using mobile phone data from 1.2 million devices
in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of the COVID-19
crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity,
mobility, and circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns
with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that
Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on
public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific
responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down
gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively,
while sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms tend to synchronize. In
particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the
lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tend to
restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to
avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the
lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts
return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent
population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on
behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is
reduced by one hour. We discuss the findings in the light of gender-specific
coping strategies in response to stress and crisis.

President of the United States. Working with a data set comprising around 20
billion 1-grams, we first compare each day's 1-gram and 2-gram usage

for Trump stories for 2016 through 2020. We measure Trump's narrative control,
the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We
then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy -- the rate at which
a population's stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that
2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation
slowed dramatically during the first two major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic,
with rapid turnover returning first with the Black Lives Matter protests
following George Floyd's murder and then later by events leading up to and

dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results

  Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT Images","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a
tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world. In the
fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and
effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to
this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which
may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where
patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients
with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require
expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have
negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce
COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored
for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven
design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark
CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National
Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases.
Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an
explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the
decision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that
COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both
COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an
open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While
COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that
releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and
citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.

  Opportunities for COVID-19","The current pandemic has highlighted the need for methodologies that can
quickly and reliably prioritize clinically approved compounds for their
potential effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the past decade, network
medicine has developed and validated multiple predictive algorithms for drug
repurposing, exploiting the sub-cellular network-based relationship between a
drug's targets and disease genes. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on
artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each
of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To
test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs that had been
experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, and the list of drugs under clinical
trial, that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential
COVID-19 efficacy. We find that while most algorithms offer predictive power
for these ground truth data, no single method offers consistently reliable
outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This prompted us to develop a
multimodal approach that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, showing that
a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the
performance of the best individual pipelines. We find that 76 of the 77 drugs
that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by
SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these drugs rely on network-based actions that
cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a
methodological pathway to identify repurposable drugs for future pathogens and
neglected diseases underserved by the costs and extended timeline of de novo
drug development.

control an epidemic. It enables to isolate the detected infected individuals,
thereby limiting the disease transmission to the susceptible population.
However, despite the significance of testing policies, the recent literature on
the subject lacks a control-theoretic perspective. In this work, an epidemic
model that incorporates the testing rate as a control input is presented. The
proposed model differentiates the undetected infected from the detected
infected cases, who are assumed to be removed from the disease spreading
process in the population. First, the model is estimated and validated for
COVID-19 data in France. Then, two testing policies are proposed, the so-called
best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for
testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a lower
bound on the testing rate such that the epidemic switches from a spreading to a
non-spreading state. The COST policy is a mitigation strategy that provides an
optimal value of testing rate that minimizes the peak value of the infected
population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies
are evaluated by predicting the number of active intensive care unit (ICU)
cases and the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19.

to repeating waves of infection. We show -- as proof of concept grounded on
rigorous mathematical evidence -- that periodic, high-frequency alternation of
into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while
allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i)
predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii)
robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements
over short time scales. In turn -- while not eliminating the virus -- this fast
switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until
a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs
associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of
1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days
working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on
measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the
potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown

  population in China","Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of
the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental
ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and
when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully
rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an
exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible.
Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an
important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the
political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection
theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and
develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime
to a critical one. A new sequential test -- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic
sequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available
COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST
is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off
between average decision delay $\Delta$ and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely
proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary
restrictive measures. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as
possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the
same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales
exponentially with the delay, $R \sim \exp{(-\omega \Delta)}$, where $\omega$
depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one
possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of
countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects
the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to three weeks,
much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident.

  Santiago during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main
non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to
contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such
interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that
exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is
that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility
measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the
city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data
linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing
measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on
socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while
zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around
50\% to 90\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions
are only 20\% to 50\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in
higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary
shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that
our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10\%
increase in mobility correlates with a 5\% increase in the rate of infection.
Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences
in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city.
Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income
communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be
effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic
levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable
their inhabitants to increase compliance.

assess stability and generalizability of these summaries. In our paper, we
exploit recently proposed distance metrics of unlabelled ranked binary trees

an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for computing the Frechet

  Optional Automated Camera Calibration for Large Scale Deployment","Social distancing has been suggested as one of the most effective measures to
break the chain of viral transmission in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We
herein describe a computer vision-based AI-assisted solution to aid compliance
with social distancing norms. The solution consists of modules to detect and
track people and to identify distance violations. It provides the flexibility
to choose between a tool-based mode or an automated mode of camera calibration,
making the latter suitable for large-scale deployments. In this paper, we
discuss different metrics to assess the risk associated with social distancing
violations and how we can differentiate between transient or persistent
violations. Our proposed solution performs satisfactorily under different test
scenarios, processes video feed at real-time speed as well as addresses data
privacy regulations by blurring faces of detected people, making it ideal for
deployments.

  Smoothers","The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a variety of approaches for managing
infection outbreaks in international populations. One example is mobile phone
applications, which attempt to alert infected individuals and their contacts by
automatically inferring two key components of infection risk: the proximity to
an individual who may be infected, and the duration of proximity. The former
component, proximity, relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal
Strength Indicator(RSSI) as a distance sensor, and this has been shown to be
problematic; not least because of unpredictable variations caused by different
device types, device location on-body, device orientation, the local
environment and the general noise associated with radio frequency propagation.
In this paper, we present an approach that infers posterior probabilities over
distance given sequences of RSSI values. Using a single-dimensional Unscented
Kalman Smoother (UKS) for non-linear state space modelling, we outline several
Gaussian process observation transforms, including: a generative model that
directly captures sources of variation; and a discriminative model that learns
a suitable observation function from training data using both distance and
infection risk as optimisation objective functions. Our results show that good
risk prediction can be achieved in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time on real-world data
sets, with the UKS outperforming more traditional classification methods
learned from the same training data.

  in Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every human activity and, because of
the urgency of finding the proper responses to such an unprecedented emergency,
it generated a diffused societal debate. The online version of this discussion
was not exempted by the presence of d/misinformation campaigns, but differently
from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -- intentional or
not -- flow of false information put at severe risk the public health, reducing
the effectiveness of governments' countermeasures. In the present manuscript,
we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate
on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities.
In order to extract the discursive communities, we focus on verified users,
i.e. accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We thus infer
the various discursive communities based on how verified users are perceived by
standard ones: if two verified accounts are considered as similar by non
unverified ones, we link them in the network of certified accounts. We first
observe that, beside being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion
show a clear division in what results to be different political groups. At this
point, by using a commonly available fact-checking software (NewsGuard), we
assess the reputation of the pieces of news exchanged. We filter the network of
retweets (i.e. users re-broadcasting the same elementary piece of information,
or tweet) from random noise and check the presence of messages displaying an
url. The impact of misinformation posts reaches the 22.1% in the right and
center-right wing community and its contribution is even stronger in absolute
numbers, due to the activity of this group: 96% of all non reputable urls
shared by political groups come from this community.

  study","The outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic results in unprecedented demand
for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of patients for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of
individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput
of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known
and studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on
unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only
objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the
case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of
this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently
repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a
computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR
tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of
false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests,
especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001
the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing
the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of
individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more
than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests
in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the
expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the proposed
procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case of diseases
like COVID-19.

diseases. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus also termed Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which is considered to be
a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a high false-negative
rate. Therefore, the research community is exploring alternative diagnostic
mechanisms. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a feasible and
effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this work, we propose
the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class classification problem
namely COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. We propose a three-stage framework,
named COV-ELM based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Our dataset comprises
CXR images in a frontal view, namely Poster anterior (PA) and Erect
anteroposterior (AP). Stage one deals with preprocessing and transformation,
stage 2 deals with the challenge of extracting relevant features which are
passed as input to the ELM at the third stage, resulting in the identification
of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in this work has been motivated by its
significantly shorter training time as compared to conventional gradient-based
learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become available, it can be
quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models. We use
10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the results of applying COV-ELM. The
COV-ELM achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity
of ${0.94 \pm 0.02}$ at a 95% confidence interval. When compared to

fill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of
Bluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80
participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world
gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting
proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially
crowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in
need, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover,
technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused
by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users'
willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still
be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity
of up to 20m lasting for an hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that
existing contact-tracing apps can be re-purposed to focus on coarse-grained
proximity detection, and that future ones calibrate distance estimates and
adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.

  through an agent-based approach","Mobility restriction is considered one of the main policies to contain
COVID-10 spreading. However, there are multiple ways to reduce mobility via
differentiated restrictions, and it is not easy to predict the actual impact on
virus spreading. This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to implement
effective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to
understand this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models
capable of predicting the impact of different scenarios. Besides, they should
be able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way, so to understand the
possible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in
relation to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection.
This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the
COVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction scenarios. The model
uses the Italian case study with its 20 administrative regions and considers
parameters that can be attributed to the diffusion and lethality of the virus
(based on a virus spread risk model) and population mobility patterns. The
model is calibrated with real data and reproduces the impact that different
mobility restrictions can have on the pandemic diffusion based on a combination
of static and dynamic parameters. Results suggest that virus spreading would
have been similar if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on
a-priori risk parameters instead of a national lockdown would have been put in
place in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic. The proposed model could
give useful suggestions for decision-makers to tackle pandemics and virus
spreading at a strategic level.

it is important to incorporate mobility between populations into the

SEIR model to account for the dynamic flight network, by estimating the
imported cases based on the air traffic volume as well as the test positive
rate at the source. This modification, called Flight-SEIR, can potentially
enable 1). early detection of outbreaks due to imported pre-symptomatic and
asymptomatic cases, 2). more accurate estimation of the reproduction number and
3). evaluation of the impact of travel restrictions and the implications of

  COVID-19 patients","Automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic CT enables rapid quantitative
analysis of lung involvement in COVID- 19 infections. Obtaining voxel-level
annotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive.
Therefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense
regression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation
approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated
from high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs
provide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object
segmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network
to compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local
details. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe
lesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information
regarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification
approach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense
conditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The
refined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation
network. When evaluated on 69 CT scans, our method substantially improves the
intersection over union from 0.335 in the CAM-based weakly supervised
segmentation method to 0.495.

not increase the number of interviews they offer, then no doctor is better off
and many doctors are potentially harmed. This adverse consequence is the result
of what we call interview hoarding. We prove this analytically and characterize
optimal mitigation strategies for special cases. We use simulations to extend
these insights to more general settings.

optimizing medical resources. Forecasting emerging outbreaks pose a particular
challenge because many existing forecasting techniques learn from historical
seasons trends. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM-based cells are a
logical choice of model due to their ability to learn temporal dynamics. In
this paper, we adapt the state and county level influenza model, TDEFSI-LONLY,
proposed in Wang et a. [l2020] to national and county level COVID-19 data. We
show that this model poorly forecasts the current pandemic. We analyze the two
week ahead forecasting capabilities of the TDEFSI-LONLY model with combinations
of regularization techniques. Effective training of the TDEFSI-LONLY model
requires data augmentation, to overcome this challenge we utilize an SEIR model
and present an inter-county mixing extension to this model to simulate
sufficient training data. Further, we propose an alternate forecast model, {\it
County Level Epidemiological Inference Recurrent Network} (\alg{}) that trains
an LSTM backbone on national confirmed cases to learn a low dimensional time
pattern and utilizes a time distributed dense layer to learn individual county
confirmed case changes each day for a two weeks forecast. We show that the

types (e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that
recording each infected individual's infection age, i.e., the time elapsed
since infection, 1. The age distribution $n(t, a)$ of the population at time
$t$ can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial
differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. 2.
The frequency of type $i$ at time $t$ is simply obtained by integrating the
probability $p(a, i)$ of being in state $i$ at age a against the age
distribution $n(t, a)$. The advantage of this approach is three-fold. First,
regardless of the number of types, macroscopic observables (e.g., incidence or
prevalence of each type) only rely on a one-dimensional PDE ""decorated"" with
types. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the
McKendrick-von Foerster PDE with Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the
epidemic. We illustrate this technique using a French data from the COVID-19
epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard
compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models
can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet
equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity
of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a
universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based
epidemic models, here the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting
age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single
individual.

both the society and economy. A key factor contributing to the sustained
spreading is the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or hidden
spreaders, who mix among the susceptible population without being detected or

method of detecting the asymptomatic spreaders in contact-tracing networks, and
validated it on the empirical COVID-19 spreading network in Singapore. We find
that using pure physical spreading equations, the hidden spreaders of COVID-19
can be identified with remarkable accuracy. Specifically, based on the unique
characteristics of COVID-19 spreading dynamics, we propose a computational
framework capturing the transition probabilities among different infectious

networks, that are designed as baselines in this work, as well as random
screening of infection's closest contacts widely used by China in its early

research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum
approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive
design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum
principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the
proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation
functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in
TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated
extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and
Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were evaluated in
a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets,
including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients
with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound
images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy
controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall
higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by
either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating
its potential to be the new benchmark or gold standard AF in CNNs and aid image
classification tasks involved in critical applications, such as medical
diagnoses of COVID-19 and PD.

  COVID-19 Diagnosis and Severity Quantification","Developing a robust algorithm to diagnose and quantify the severity of
COVID-19 using Chest X-ray (CXR) requires a large number of well-curated
COVID-19 datasets, which is difficult to collect under the global COVID-19
pandemic. On the other hand, CXR data with other findings are abundant. This
situation is ideally suited for the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture,
where a lot of unlabeled data can be used through structural modeling by the
self-attention mechanism. However, the use of existing ViT is not optimal,
since feature embedding through direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in
the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we
propose a novel Vision Transformer that utilizes low-level CXR feature corpus
obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings.
Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets
to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc.
Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a
Transformer model for the diagnosis and the severity quantification of
COVID-19. We evaluate our model on various external test datasets from totally
different institutions to evaluate the generalization capability. The
experimental results confirm that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art
performance in both diagnosis and severity quantification tasks with superior
generalization capability, which are sine qua non of widespread deployment.

country, race, religion, and economy. The current gold standard method for
COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and
violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a
while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these
limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of
COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory
sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful
insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper
presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called
Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound
samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application.
The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving,
the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that
insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based
technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and
in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.

  Media Data","Shaped by human movement, place connectivity is quantified by the strength of
spatial interactions among locations. For decades, spatial scientists have
researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing
popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social
interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable,
and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place
connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by
geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement
measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits
a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10
percent penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness
index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found
that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the
distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a
denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great
potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity
knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of
COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and 2) modeling hurricane
evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of
PCI, together with the launched visualization platform and open-sourced PCI

coronavirus diseases across the world. These outbreaks often led to respiratory
tract diseases and have proved to be fatal sometimes. Currently, we are facing
an elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the

transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets
released by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing,

which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs,
commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents
an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human
faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are
forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same
problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately

mid-February 2021. Mumbai was amongst the first cities to see the increase. In
this report, we use our agent based simulator to computationally study the
second wave in Mumbai. We build upon our earlier analysis, where projections
were made from November 2020 onwards. We use our simulator to conduct an
extensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through
varying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance,
infectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and
infection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain
the second wave fatality numbers. We observe and highlight that timings of peak
and valley of the fatalities in the second wave are robust to many plausible
scenarios, suggesting that they are likely to be accurate projections for
Mumbai. During the second wave, the observed fatalities were low in February
and mid-March and saw a phase change or a steep increase in the growth rate
after around late March. We conduct extensive experiments to replicate this
observed sharp convexity. This is not an easy phenomena to replicate, and we
find that explanations such as increased laxity in the population, increased
reinfections, increased intensity of infections in Mumbai transportation,
increased lethality in the virus, or a combination amongst them, generally do a
poor job of matching this pattern. We find that the most likely explanation is
presence of small amount of extremely infective variant on February 1 that
grows rapidly thereafter and becomes a dominant strain by Mid-March. From a
prescriptive view, this points to an urgent need for extensive and continuous
genome sequencing to establish existence and prevalence of different virus
strains in Mumbai and in India, as they evolve over time.

corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass
analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire
survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results
showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more
supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were
more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it
was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona
countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just
by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term
goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against
corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their
intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and
to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company
to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the
company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.

  COVID-19 Streamline Diagnostic","In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, deep learning methods have been widely
investigated in detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays. However, a more pragmatic
approach to applying AI methods to a medical diagnosis is designing a framework
that facilitates human-machine interaction and expert decision making. Studies
have shown that categorization can play an essential rule in accelerating
real-world decision making. Inspired by descriptive document clustering, we
propose a domain-independent explanatory clustering framework to group
contextually related instances and support radiologists' decision making. While
most descriptive clustering approaches employ domain-specific characteristics
to form meaningful clusters, we focus on model-level explanation as a more
general-purpose element of every learning process to achieve cluster
homogeneity. We employ DeepSHAP to generate homogeneous clusters in terms of
disease severity and describe the clusters using favorable and unfavorable
saliency maps, which visualize the class discriminating regions of an image.
These human-interpretable maps complement radiologist knowledge to investigate
the whole cluster at once. Besides, as part of this study, we evaluate a model
based on VGG-19, which can identify COVID and pneumonia cases with a positive
predictive value of 95% and 97%, respectively, comparable to the recent
explainable approaches for COVID diagnosis.

isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on
tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and
only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of
the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests
for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the
outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions
emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded)
relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is
unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on
the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists
no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring
or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing
policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any
second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is
within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and
tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000
tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for
which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative
analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent
serological studies.

in the world. A lockdown for a period of 2 months, due to the pandemic, was
enough to cause a drop of 7% of the anthropogonic CO2 in the atmosphere. In
addition to the world in general, the excess of the anthropogonic CO2 emission
in the atmosphere has always been a threat to the oceans as well. Oceans play a
key role to buffer the greenhouse effect, but in the process, it becomes
warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated. While there have already been
investigations done on the effect of pandemic on atmosphere, the question what
happens to oceans during the pandemic remains unanswered. The aim of this paper
is to study the pandemic's effect and the resultant reduction in CO2 emissions
on the productivity of the global oceans. Often Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a),
Particulate organic and inorganic carbon (PIC:POC) and sea surface
temperature(SST), are used to indicate the productivity of oceans. Herein,
satellite-derived estimates of the aforementioned parameters are used. Based on
these estimates, a drop in Chl-a (0.5 mgm-3) is observed off Alaska, North
Europe,South China and Southeast USA during the pandemic. CO2 reduction of 123
MtCO2 during the pandemic in China might have caused reduction in mean Chl-a by
around 5% (2.5 to 1.6 mgm-3). Reduction of Chl-a during the pandemic is mostly
associated with the reduction of PIC:POC. The pandemic demonstrates noticeable
effect on Chl-a and/or SST. A cooling response of 0.5 oC in mean SST is
observed over most of the coastal areas, especially off Alaska,north Indian
ocean and eastern Pacific. The decrease in the CO2 emissions in India by 30%
during the pandemic translates into a drop of mean SST in the north Indian
ocean by 5% (from 29.95 to 28.46 oC). All these suggest that maintaining global
activities as sustainable as the pandemic period, can help to recover the
oceans.

one of the key symptoms. Studies show that in these cases, voice production is
also adversely affected -- vocal fold oscillations are asynchronous,
asymmetrical and more restricted during phonation. This paper proposes a method
that analyzes the differential dynamics of the glottal flow waveform (GFW)
during voice production to identify features in them that are most significant
for the detection of COVID-19 from voice. Since it is hard to measure this
directly in COVID-19 patients, we infer it from recorded speech signals and
compare it to the GFW computed from physical model of phonation. For normal
voices, the difference between the two should be minimal, since physical models
are constructed to explain phonation under assumptions of normalcy. Greater
differences implicate anomalies in the bio-physical factors that contribute to
the correctness of the physical model, revealing their significance indirectly.
Our proposed method uses a CNN-based 2-step attention model that locates
anomalies in time-feature space in the difference of the two GFWs, allowing us
to infer their potential as discriminative features for classification. The
viability of this method is demonstrated using a clinically curated dataset of
COVID-19 positive and negative subjects.

also the activity level of the occupants. We introduce, and use for our
evaluations, a metric $R_0^{eff}$ that represents the ratio of new infections

individuals at the beginning of the week. This can be seen as a surrogate for
the well-known $R_0$ reproductive number metric, but limited in scope to

universal mask usage results in an approximately $3.6\times$ reduction in new
infections through classroom interactions. Moving 90% of the classes online

production for the same period in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, shrunk at an
offset of about 9.20%, which resulted in the modest reduction of about
(-1.79%), in the atmospheric CO$_2$, to that of 2017-2018 CO$_2$ level; 2) a
non-seasonal abrupt; but brief, atmospheric CO$_2$ decrease by about 0.85% in
mid-February 2020, could be due to the Phase 1 movement restrictions in China.
The results showed that, the reduction in electricity production is significant
to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO$_2$. It also highlights the
significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO$_2$, which suggests
that, without the national restriction of activities, CO$_2$ concentration are
set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and
sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the
atmospheric CO$_2$ reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved,

useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production

amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural
networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single
cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven
Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the
manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate
methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher
level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients.
More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively

  Applications","The novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly and abruptly changed the
world as we knew in 2020. It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic
epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its
high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important
to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and
be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an
important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of
medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in
a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation
of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can
assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis,
severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients.
In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state,
challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for
diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity
assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by
elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic
epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging
modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed.
SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are
then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19
lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and;
Diagnosis/classification models. Finally, open problems and opportunities are
presented in detail.

  single and multi-layer face masks","By now it is well-understood that the usage of facemasks provides protection
from transmission of viral loads through exhalation and inhalation of
respiratory droplets. Therefore, during the current Covid-19 pandemic the usage
of face masks is strongly recommended by health officials. Although three-layer
masks are generally advised for usage, many commonly available or homemade
masks contain only single and double layers. In this study, we show through
detailed physics based analyses and high speed imaging that high momentum cough
droplets on impingement on single- and double-layer masks can lead to
significant partial penetration and more importantly atomization into numerous
much smaller daughter droplets, thereby increasing the total population of the
aerosol, which can remain suspended for a longer time. The possibility of
secondary atomization of high momentum cough droplets due to impingement,
hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous
network of the mask has not been explored before. However, this unique mode of
aerosol generation poses a finite risk of infection as shown in this work. We
also demonstrate that in single layer masks close to 70 % of a given droplet
volume is atomized and only 30 % is trapped within the fibers. The entrapped
volume is close to 90 % for double layer masks which still allows some
atomization into smaller droplets. We however found that a triple-layer
surgical mask permits negligible penetration and hence should be effective in
preventing disease transmission.

  Denoising","Being low-level radiation exposure and less harmful to health, low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT) has been widely adopted in the early screening of
lung cancer and COVID-19. LDCT images inevitably suffer from the degradation
problem caused by complex noises. It was reported that, compared with
commercial iterative reconstruction methods, deep learning (DL)-based LDCT
denoising methods using convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved competitive
performance. Most existing DL-based methods focus on the local information
extracted by CNN, while ignoring both explicit non-local and context
information (which are leveraged by radiologists). To address this issue, we
propose a novel deep learning model named radiologist-inspired deep denoising
network (RIDnet) to imitate the workflow of a radiologist reading LDCT images.
Concretely, the proposed model explicitly integrates all the local, non-local
and context information rather than local information only. Our
radiologist-inspired model is potentially favoured by radiologists as a
familiar workflow. A double-blind reader study on a public clinical dataset
shows that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model achieves
the most impressive performance in terms of the structural fidelity, the noise
suppression and the overall score. As a physicians-inspired model, RIDnet gives
a new research roadmap that takes into account the behavior of physicians when
designing decision support tools for assisting clinical diagnosis. Models and

quick public health investigations of the relationships between behaviours and
infection risk are essential. Recently the test-negative design was proposed to
recruit and survey participants who are symptomatic and being tested for
SARS-CoV-2 infection with the goal of evaluating associations between the
survey responses (including behaviours and environment) and testing positive on
the test. It was also proposed to recruit additional controls who are part of
the general population as a baseline comparison group in order to evaluate risk
factors specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we consider an
alternative design where we recruit among all individuals, symptomatic and
asymptomatic, being tested for the virus in addition to population controls. We
define a regression parameter related to a prospective risk factor analysis and
investigate its identifiability under the two study designs. We review the
difference between the prospective risk factor parameter and the parameter
targeted in the typical test-negative design where only symptomatic and tested
people are recruited.
  Using missing data directed acyclic graphs we provide conditions and required

  Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of
universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one
employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing
individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1)
significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a
population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the
population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking
is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when
universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower
filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we
compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected
that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies,
their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily
case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early
universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or
reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical
simulations.
  Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of
universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is
emerging as a key NPI; a ""mouth-and-nose lockdown"" is far more sustainable than
a ""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An
interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all.
We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for
correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure
self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's
community.

  Execution Environment","Existing Bluetooth-based Private Contact Tracing (PCT) systems can privately
detect whether people have come into direct contact with COVID-19 patients.
However, we find that the existing systems lack functionality and flexibility,
which may hurt the success of the contact tracing. Specifically, they cannot
detect indirect contact (e.g., people may be exposed to coronavirus because of
used the same elevator even without direct contact); they also cannot flexibly
change the rules of ""risky contact"", such as how many hours of exposure or how
close to a COVID-19 patient that is considered as risk exposure, which may be
changed with the environmental situation. In this paper, we propose an
efficient and secure contact tracing system that enables both direct contact
and indirect contact. To address the above problems, we need to utilize users'
trajectory data for private contact tracing, which we call trajectory-based
PCT. We formalize this problem as Spatiotemporal Private Set Intersection. By
analyzing different approaches such as homomorphic encryption that could be
extended to solve this problem, we identify that Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) is a proposing method to achieve our requirements. The major challenge is
how to design algorithms for spatiotemporal private set intersection under
limited secure memory of TEE. To this end, we design a TEE-based system with
flexible trajectory data encoding algorithms. Our experiments on real-world
data show that the proposed system can process thousands of queries on tens of
million records of trajectory data in a few seconds.

work has become much more social than ever. Contemporary software teams rely on
a variety of collaborative practices, such as pair programming, the topic of

interaction, and physical artefacts incorporated in the shared workspace, which
the COVID-19 pandemic made unavailable; most software companies around the
world were forced to send their engineers to work from home. As software
projects and teams overnight turned into dis-tributed collaborations, we
question what happened to the pair programming practice in the work-from-home
mode. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of remote pair programming in
two companies. We conducted 38 interviews with 30 engineers from Norway,

has decreased and some interviewees report not pairing at all for almost a full
year. The experiences of those who paired vary from actively co-editing the
code by using special tools to more passively co-reading and discussing the
code and solutions by sharing the screen. Finally, we found that the interest

nonsymptomatic contacts are fundamental strategies for mitigating the current
COVID-19 pandemic. The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary
strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital
(app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness
using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the
activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network
dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual
tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into
account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure.
This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during
the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the
intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision
to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual
tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not
adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while
they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show
that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic
hybrid protocols.

Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different

delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment
is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We
compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a
different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a
Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient
features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients
initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the
best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available
works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but
instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which
allows us to compare both methods. Although the conclusion is reached through
mathematical modeling and is stable upon any reasonable model, this is a

common. The platform is plagued by various types of problematic content: 1)
disturbing videos targeting young children; 2) hateful and misogynistic
content; and 3) pseudoscientific misinformation. While YouTube's recommendation
algorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's
monetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not

problematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in
the dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative
approach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the
risks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the
recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by
focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure
to pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this
exposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that
young children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly
browse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that
Incel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active
role in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying
pseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more
pseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g.,
flat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these
recommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's

affect the COVID-19 outbreak patterns. The epidemiological, socioeconomic, and
human mobility context of COVID-19 can be considered as a complex adaptive

susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is considered to describe the
epidemic evolving process. In order to curb the spread of epidemics, we present
the spectrum-based optimization problem involving the Perron-Frobenius
eigenvalue of the matrix constructed by the network topology and transition
rates. A modified distributed link removal strategy is developed such that it
can be applied to the SIR model with heterogeneous transition rates on weighted
digraphs. The proposed approach is implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic
by using the reported infected and recovered data in each state of Germany. The
numerical experiment shows that the infected percentage can be significantly
reduced by using the distributed link removal strategy.

  Clinicians with COVID-19 ECMO Planning","Respiratory complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 have claimed
tens of thousands of lives in 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 escalate from Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) to viral pneumonia to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) to death. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO)
is a life-sustaining oxygenation and ventilation therapy that may be used for
patients with severe ARDS when mechanical ventilation is insufficient to
sustain life. While early planning and surgical cannulation for ECMO can
increase survival, clinicians report the lack of a risk score hinders these
efforts. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop the
PEER score, used to highlight critically ill patients with viral or unspecified
pneumonia at high risk of mortality or decompensation in a subpopulation
eligible for ECMO. The PEER score is validated on two large, publicly available
critical care databases and predicts mortality at least as well as other
existing risk scores. Stratifying our cohorts into low-risk and high-risk
groups, we find that the high-risk group also has a higher proportion of
decompensation indicators such as vasopressor and ventilator use. Finally, the
PEER score is provided in the form of a nomogram for direct calculation of
patient risk, and can be used to highlight at-risk patients among critical care
patients eligible for ECMO.

and disseminating computing research. Traditional venues for reviewing and
publishing, such as conferences and journals, worked effectively in the past.
Recently, trends have created new opportunities but also put new pressures on
the process of review and dissemination. For example, many conferences have
seen large increases in the number of submissions. Likewise, dissemination of
research ideas has become dramatically through publication venues such as
arXiv.org and social media networks. While these trends predate COVID-19, the
pandemic could accelerate longer term changes. Based on interviews with leading
academics in computing research, our findings include: (1) Trends impacting
computing research are largely positive and have increased the participation,
scope, accessibility, and speed of the research process. (2) Challenges remain
in securing the integrity of the process, including addressing ways to scale
the review process, avoiding attempts to misinform or confuse the dissemination
of results, and ensuring fairness and broad participation in the process
itself. Based on these findings, we recommend: (1) Regularly polling members of
the computing research community, including program and general conference
chairs, journal editors, authors, reviewers, etc., to identify specific
challenges they face to better understand these issues. (2) An influential
body, such as the Computing Research Association regularly issues a ""State of
the Computing Research Enterprise"" report to update the community on trends,
both positive and negative, impacting the computing research enterprise. (3) A
deeper investigation, specifically to better understand the influence that
social media and preprint archives have on computing research, is conducted.

COVID-19, which is spreading in China and many other countries. To avoid a
larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of
strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine
is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to
estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into
seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and
officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model
is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the
transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend
of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role
in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The
control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and
discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is
in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human
transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may
become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the
virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index
is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high

demand decrease of about $64\%$ (IATA, April 2020) which triggered already
several bankruptcies of airline companies all over the world. While the
robustness of the world airline network (WAN) was mostly studied as an
homogeneous network, we introduce a new tool for analyzing the impact of a
company failure: the `airline company network' where two airlines are connected
if they share at least one route segment. Using this tool, we observe that the
failure of companies well connected with others has the largest impact on the
connectivity of the WAN. We then explore how the global demand reduction
affects airlines differently, and provide an analysis of different scenarios if
its stays low and does not come back to its pre-crisis level. Using traffic
data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and simple assumptions about
customer's airline choice strategies, we find that the local effective demand
can be much lower than the average one, especially for companies that are not
monopolistic and share their segments with larger companies. Even if the
average demand comes back to $60\%$ of the total capacity, we find that between
$46\%$ and $59\%$ of the companies could experience a reduction of more than
$50\%$ of their traffic, depending on the type of competitive advantage that
drives customer's airline choice. These results highlight how the complex
competitive structure of the WAN weakens its robustness when facing such a
large crisis.

effectively delay the arrival of infection peak and reduce the prevalence, and
thus lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission after the students return to

sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We
performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc Dunns tests to assess
differences in these features among baseline, pre-, and during-lockdown

index (BMI), and educational background. We were able to quantify expected
changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby
Bluetooth-enabled devices between pre- and during-lockdown periods. We saw
reduced sociality as measured through mobility features, and increased virtual
sociality through phone usage. People were more active on their phones,
spending more time using social media apps, particularly around major news
events. Furthermore, participants had lower heart rate, went to bed later, and
slept more. We also found that young people had longer homestay than older
people during lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant
difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low

the US to 10% would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of the virus.
The severe restrictions in Germany which closed any public events, schools and
universities a week ago might already have contributed to a reduction of the
growth rate of reported cases below 30%.

  diseases","Knowing the physicochemical properties of exhaled droplets and aerosol
particles is a prerequisite for a detailed mechanistic understanding and
effective prevention of the airborne transmission of infectious human diseases.
This article provides a critical review and synthesis of scientific knowledge
on the number concentrations, size distributions, composition, mixing state,
and related properties of respiratory particles emitted upon breathing,
speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing. We derive and present a
parameterization of respiratory particle size distributions based on five
lognormal modes related to different origins in the respiratory tract, which
can be used to trace and localize the sources of infectious particles. This
approach may support the medical treatment as well as the risk assessment for
aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious diseases. It was applied to
analyze which respiratory activities may drive the spread of specific
pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza viruses, and
SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The results confirm the high relevance of vocalization for
the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the usefulness of physical
distancing, face masks, room ventilation, and air filtration as preventive
measures against COVID-19 and other airborne infectious diseases.

  images: model generalizability","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide research efforts have
focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on various medical
data of COVID-19-positive patients in order to identify or classify various
aspects of the disease, with promising reported results. However, concerns have
been raised over their generalizability, given the heterogeneous factors in
training datasets. This study aims to examine the severity of this problem by
evaluating deep learning (DL) classification models trained to identify
COVID-19-positive patients on 3D computed tomography (CT) datasets from
different countries. We collected one dataset at UT Southwestern (UTSW), and
three external datasets from different countries: CC-CCII Dataset (China),
COVID-CTset (Iran), and MosMedData (Russia). We divided the data into 2
classes: COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. We trained nine
identical DL-based classification models by using combinations of the datasets
with a 72% train, 8% validation, and 20% test data split. The models trained on
a single dataset achieved accuracy/area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve (AUC) values of 0.87/0.826 (UTSW), 0.97/0.988 (CC-CCCI),
and 0.86/0.873 (COVID-CTset) when evaluated on their own dataset. The models
trained on multiple datasets and evaluated on a test set from one of the
datasets used for training performed better. However, the performance dropped
close to an AUC of 0.5 (random guess) for all models when evaluated on a
different dataset outside of its training datasets. Including the MosMedData,
which only contained positive labels, into the training did not necessarily
help the performance on the other datasets. Multiple factors likely contribute
to these results, such as patient demographics and differences in image
acquisition or reconstruction, causing a data shift among different study
cohorts.

present paper we generalize this model to include the asymptomatic or

We call this the SEPAR$_d$-model. A delay differential equation version of the
model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry this
out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe
that the SEPAR$_d$ model may work better for Covid-19 than other approaches. In
the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by
the JHU, in particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from
the data. Other parameters, like the size of the dark sector, are less
accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of
representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a
few countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data
are available. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries,
three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken
countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show
that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach. At
the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking
application is that it allows a quantitative analysis of the influence of the

complementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an
end-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of
automated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and
severity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in
parallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns
learning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our
new 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances
for 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of
volumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to
accelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to
single-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930
CT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and

affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the
WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of
causing severe conditions in the patients, the development of rapid and
accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse
transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence
of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples. But, RT-PCR
suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore,
the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of
COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage
exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for
X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be used

the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the

real-time during the COVID-19 pandemic, we build a self-updating monitor of
emotion dynamics using digital traces from three different data sources. This
enables decision makers and the interested public to assess issues such as the
attitude towards counter-measures taken during the pandemic and the possible
emergence of a (mental) health crisis early on. We use web scraping and API
access to retrieve data from the news platform derstandard.at, Twitter and a
chat platform for students. We document the technical details of our workflow
in order to provide materials for other researchers interested in building a
similar tool for different contexts. Automated text analysis allows us to
highlight changes of language use during COVID-19 in comparison to a neutral
baseline. We use special word clouds to visualize that overall difference.
Longitudinally, our time series show spikes in anxiety that can be linked to
several events and media reporting. Additionally, we find a marked decrease in
anger. The changes last for remarkably long periods of time (up to 12 weeks).
We discuss these and more patterns and connect them to the emergence of
collective emotions. The interactive dashboard showcasing our data is available

viral diseases. This has accelerated the efforts to model and forecast the
disease spreading, in order to find ways to confine the spreading regionally
and between regions. Towards this we have devised a model of geographical
spreading of viral infections due to human spatial mobility and adapted it to
the latest COVID-19 pandemic. In this the region to be modelled is overlaid
with a two-dimensional grid weighted with the population density defined cells,
in each of which a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations
simulate the local dynamics (microdynamics) of the disease. The infections
between cells are stochastic and allow for the geographical spreading of the
virus over the two-dimensional space (macrodynamics). This approach allows to
separate the parameters related to the biological aspects of the disease from
the ones that represent the spatial contagious behaviour through different
kinds of mobility of people acting as virus carriers. These provide sufficient
information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In
particular we have applied this approach to three in many ways different
countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland and found that the model is capable of
reproducing and predicting the stochastic global path of the pandemic. This
study sheds light on how the diverse cultural and socioeconomic aspects of a
country influence the evolution of the epidemics and also the efficacy of
social distancing and other confinement measures.

  epidemic models","The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic
peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical
compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the
effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The
importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved
essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition,
the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of
uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this
work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a
socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the
introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous
approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled
compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The
need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the
social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global
strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly
relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected
people. Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID-19
outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.

graphs the effect of containment measures is simply captured by a
renormalization of the effective infection rate that accounts for the change in
the branching ratio of the network. In our simple setting, a piece-wise

  Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital","Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as
""seasonal viruses"" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words,
meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this
information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In
this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals
in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from
patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We
propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of
positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds
of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these
distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations
to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological
conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar
variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings
highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a
related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under
different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be
easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced
approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as
those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is
at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the

  Pandemic","Background: A major question in Covid-19 research is whether democracies
handled the Covid-19 pandemic crisis better or worse than authoritarian
countries. However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus
authoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death
counts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting
of pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to
variability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing
capacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore
potential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.
  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government
Covid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the
generally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from
the recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the
context of the political and fragile state dimensions.
  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths
by authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)
substantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to
standard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian
governments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic
than democratic governments.
  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent
to authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic
statistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess
pandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in
studies using death as an outcome variable.

carrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational
structure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This
relational information can convey some form of domain information about the

image. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,

learned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We
evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four
popular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
Moreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:

  COVID-19","Countries highly exposed to incoming traffic from China were expected to be
at the highest risk of COVID-19 spread. However, COVID-19 case numbers
(infection levels) are negatively correlated with incoming traffic-level.
Moreover, infection levels are positively correlated with population-size,
while the latter should only affect infection-level once herd immunity is
reached. These could be explained if a low-virulence strain (LVS) began
spreading a few months earlier from China, providing immunity from the later
emerging known SARS-CoV-2 high-virulence strain (HVS). We find that the
dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic depend on the LVS and HVS spread
doubling-times and the delay between their initial onsets. We find that LVS
doubling-time to be $T_L\sim1.59\pm0.17$ times slower than the HVS ($T_H$), but
its earlier onset allowed its global wide-spread to the levels required for
herd-immunity. In countries exposed earlier to the LVS and/or having smaller
population-size, the LVS achieved herd-immunity earlier, allowing less time for
the spread of the HVS, and giving rise to lower HVS-infection levels. Such
model accurately predicts a country's infection-level ({\rm R^{2}=0.74};
p-value of {\rm 5.2\times10^{-13}}), given only its population-size and
incoming-traffic from China. It explains the negative correlation with
incoming-traffic ($c_{exp}$), the positive correlation with the population size
(n_{pop}) and their specific relations (${\rm N}_{{\rm cases}}\propto
n_{pop}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}}}}\times c_{exp}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}-1}}}$).
We find that most countries should have already achieved herd-immunity. Further
COVID-19-spread in these countries is limited and is not expected to rise by
more than a factor of 2-3. We suggest tests/predictions to further verify the
model and biologically identify the LVS, and discuss the implications.

  SARS-CoV","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic clock is ticking and the survival of many
of mankind's modern institutions and or survival of many individuals is at
stake. There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as
SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified;
those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice.
  Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three
svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment
algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment
scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches as much as the other
mutations. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can
bind to U, hence, our scoring. We also validate this hypothesis using a novel,
independent computational experiment. To validate our results, we confirmed the
discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the tested publicly available
genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2
orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also
report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered
orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore,
antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.

  Design: Retrospective cohort, analysed using stratified Cox regression.
  Setting: Community-based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked
with hospitalisation data.
  Participants: 839,278 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, of whom 36,233
had been hospitalised within 14 days, tested between 23rd November 2020 and
31st January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay
that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF). SGTF is a proxy test
for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity,
deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test.
  Main outcome measures: Hospitalisation between 1 and 14 days after the first
positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
  Results: 27,710 of 592,409 SGTF patients (4.7%) and 8,523 of 246,869 non-SGTF
patients (3.5%) had been hospitalised within 1-14 days. The stratum-adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalisation was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.47 to 1.57) for COVID-19 patients infected with SGTF variants, compared to
those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age
(P<0.001), with HRs of 0.93-1.21 for SGTF compared to non-SGTF patients below
age 20 years, 1.29 in those aged 20-29, and 1.45-1.65 in age groups 30 years or
older.
  Conclusions: The results suggest that the risk of hospitalisation is higher

SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease. The higher severity may be
specific to adults above the age of 30.

intervention (NPI) response to disease incidence into one closed model
consisting of two coupled delay differential equations for the incidence rate

parameters, the initial reproduction number, the intervention strength, and the
response delay relative to the time of infection. The NPI response is modeled
by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional
to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold.
This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the
parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated
by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation.
For parameters relevant for the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from
damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of the order of one
week, and suggests that effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic
waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner,
rather than merely as a response to the present incidence rate.

health emergency. As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug
developments, Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here,
using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding
energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to
find the key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding
affinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses
identified three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues
(Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to
be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces are from van
der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. It is also worth
mention that we found seven mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476,
Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the
RBD-ACE2 binding. Very interestingly, the most repulsive residue at the
RBD-ACE2 interface (E484), is found to be mutated in the latest UK variant,
B1.1.7, cause complete virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing
COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Our present results indicate that at least from
the energetic point of view such E484 mutation may have beneficial effects on
ACE2 binding. The present study provides a systematical understanding, from the
energetic point of view, of the binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2
acceptor. We hope that the present findings of three binding patches, key
attracting residues and unexpected mutational sites can provide insights to the
design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active antibodies.

  Tracing Applications","Contact tracing is an important measure to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. In
the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the
rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is
cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large
number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital
contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact
tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements
and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact
tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed
that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better
controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the
collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption
rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy.
In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in
multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for
mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting
contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly
effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on
various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set
Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact
tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these
techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact
tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication
complexity expressions for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic
techniques that can be more suitably deployed there.

interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers

to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing
approaches are often applying standard models of the respective research field.
This habit, however, often comes along with certain restrictions. For instance,
most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate
unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human
mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions
by exploiting these data structures, yet lack intuitive interpretability as
they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a trade-off between
both research directions and present a multimodal learning approach that
combines the advantages of statistical regression and machine learning models
for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany. This novel approach enables the
use of a richer collection of data types, including mobility flows and
colocation probabilities, and yields the lowest MSE scores throughout our
observational period in our benchmark study. The results corroborate the
necessity of including mobility data and showcase the flexibility and
interpretability of our approach.

COVID-19 associated fatalities runs the risk of incurring in several kinds of
biases. One of the ways to approach the issue is to compare overall mortality
during the pandemic with expected mortality computed using the observed
mortality figures of previous years. In this paper, we build on existing
methodology and propose two ways to compute expected as well as excess
mortality, namely at the weekly and at the yearly level. Particular focus is
put on the role of age, which plays a central part in both COVID-19-associated

  disordered multiplex networks","The frequent emergence of diseases with the potential to become threats at
local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently
COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease
propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations.
Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context,
especially in human contact networks, here we examine the
susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex
network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a
fraction $q$ of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through
weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or
disordered); weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using
branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing
strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the
intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find
that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic
can be prevented, increase with the overlap $q$. Also we study the effect of
the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals,
which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find
that for relatively small values of the overlap $q$, social distancing policies
might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.

Third, we provide a complete solution for the moderate infection regime (with
constant treatment). Finally, we give a thorough interpretation of the control

epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective
preventive measures to control this pandemic. Therefore, in this paper, an
optimization problem is formulated that accommodates both isolation and social
distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we solve
the formulated problem by applying a noncooperative game that can provide an
incentive for maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is interpreted with the
help of our proposed game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social
distancing where there exists a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we perform an
extensive numerical analysis that shows the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in terms of achieving the desired social-distancing to prevent the
outbreak of the COVID-19 in a noncooperative environment. Numerical results
show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing
percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The
numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home
isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of
individuals.

formulated to show the impact of the latency period on the severity of
COVID-19. Since there is evidence that for COVID-19 disease, important
relationships exist between what is happening in the host and what is occurring
at the population level, we shall link the basic model to in-host dynamics
through the so-called threshold-type delay models. Finally, we will include
demographic effects to the most complex models and we will conduct rigorous
bifurcation analysis to quantify possible factors responsible for disease
progression.

which test-takers were required to wear face masks during the test
administration, and we compare it to a matched control sample of test-takers
who took the same test before the mask requirements were put in place. We find
that the two samples differ across a range of acoustic measures and also show a
small but significant difference in speech patterns. However, these differences
do not lead to differences in human or automated scores of English language
proficiency. Several measures of bias showed no differences in scores between
the two groups.

  Migrating to Public Clouds","With the emergence of mandatory remote education and work in universities due
to COVID-19, the `zoomification' of higher education, i.e., the migration of
universities to the clouds, reached the public discourse. Ongoing discussions
reason about how this shift will take control over students' data away from
universities, and may ultimately prevent privacy from being an attainable goal
for researchers and students alike. However, there has been no comprehensive
measurement of universities' use of public clouds and reliance on
Software-as-a-Service offerings to assess how far this migration has already
progressed.
  In this paper, we perform a longitudinal study of the migration to public
clouds among universities in the U.S. and Europe, as well as institutions
listed in the Times Higher Education (THE) Top100 between January 2015 and
December 2020. We find that cloud-adoption differs between countries, with one
cluster (Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland) showing a limited move to
clouds, while the other cluster (U.S., U.K., the Netherlands, THE Top100)
frequently migrates universities' core functions and services to public clouds
-- starting long before the COVID-19 pandemic. We attribute this clustering to
several socio-economic factors in the respective countries, including the
general culture of higher education and the administrative paradigm taken
towards running universities. We then analyze and interpret our results,
finding that the implications reach beyond individuals' privacy towards
questions of academic independence and integrity.

  Patterns Detection in X-ray Images","Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, is nowadays one of the most prominent
challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus
propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The
standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to
the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening
methods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing
promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these
methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and
availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet
efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of
COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective
we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural
networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other
applications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a
hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed
approaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the
three classes were used to assess the quality of the methods. Results: The
results show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality
model, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and
positive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters
than other than the other tested architectures. Larger and more heterogeneous
databases are still needed for validation before claiming that deep learning
can assist physicians in the task of detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images.

  Conferencing Applications","Video conferencing applications (VCAs) have become a critical Internet
application, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic, as users worldwide now
rely on them for work, school, and telehealth. It is thus increasingly
important to understand the resource requirements of different VCAs and how
they perform under different network conditions, including: how much speed
(upstream and downstream throughput) a VCA needs to support high quality of
experience; how VCAs perform under temporary reductions in available capacity;
how they compete with themselves, with each other, and with other applications;
and how usage modality (e.g., number of participants) affects utilization. We
study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to
these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average
utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps.
Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds
to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control
algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained
bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75% of the
available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For
some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants
increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video
stream given a larger number of participants. Finally, one participant's
viewing mode (e.g., pinning a speaker) can affect the upstream utilization of
other participants.

  Mila's Proposal for a Contact Tracing App","Contact tracing has grown in popularity as a promising solution to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of automated contact tracing are two-fold.
Contact tracing promises to reduce the number of infections by being able to:
1) systematically identify all of those that have been in contact with someone
who has had COVID; and, 2) ensure those that have been exposed to the virus do
not unknowingly infect others. ""COVI"" is the name of a recent contact tracing
app developed by Mila and was proposed to help combat COVID-19 in Canada. The
app was designed to inform each individual of their relative risk of being
infected with the virus, which Mila claimed would empower citizens to make
informed decisions about their movement and allow for a data-driven approach to
public health policy; all the while ensuring data is safeguarded from
governments, companies, and individuals. This article will provide a critical
response to Mila's COVI White Paper. Specifically, this article will discuss:
the extent to which diversity has been considered in the design of the app,
assumptions surrounding users' interaction with the app and the app's utility,
as well as unanswered questions surrounding transparency, accountability, and
security. We see this as an opportunity to supplement the excellent risk
analysis done by the COVI team to surface insights that can be applied to other
contact- and proximity-tracing apps that are being developed and deployed
across the world. Our hope is that, through a meaningful dialogue, we can
ultimately help organizations develop better solutions that respect the
fundamental rights and values of the communities these solutions are meant to
serve.

permitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine; their
adoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often
produce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to
specify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated
developing an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that
utilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy
through the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more
accurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary
tissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction
with V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging
realm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high
performance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct
diseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included
none of these cases. The benefit of our external validation test is
specifically relevant since our choice includes those patients who have
diagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To ensure
equal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the
following performance (Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97,
COPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis 0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92,
all at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT images, the

is strictly connected to one fit parameter we call mitigation factor, which in
turn is mostly dependent only on the enclosed population. Despite its
simpleness, this description applies to every of the around 50 countries we
have analyzed, allows to separate different waves of the pandemic, provides a
figure of merit for the overall usefulness of government measures, and shows
when a pandemic is ending. Our model is robust against undetected cases, and

  studies in Europe","In December 2019, the first patients in Wuhan, China were diagnosed with a
primary atypical pneumonia, which showed to be unknown and contagious. Since
then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2,
has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the
crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The
results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for
improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform
beyond the current public health dogma called ""flatten-the-curve"". There are
several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases.
Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data,
these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in
the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that
epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that
assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19
pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other
and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the
simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen
whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures
taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the
quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that
countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates
in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a
good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing
the spread of COVID-19.

the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention

older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does
not appear to significantly affect community transmission. A large-scale
reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears
feasible in countries such as Denmark or Norway, where community transmission
is generally low. However, school reopening can contribute to significant
increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community

cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy

  considering variability in virus and T cell dynamics","Biological processes at the cellular level are stochastic in nature, and the
immune response system is no different. Therefore, models that attempt to
explain this system need to also incorporate noise or fluctuations that can
account for the observed variability. In this work, a stochastic model of the
immune response system is presented in terms of the dynamics of the T cells and
the virus particles. Making use of the Green's function and the Wilemski-Fixman
approximation, this model is then solved to obtain the analytical expression
for the joint probability density function of these variables in the early and
late stages of infection. This is then also used to calculate the average level
of virus particles in the system. Upon comparing the theoretically predicted
average virus levels to those of COVID-19 patients, it is hypothesized that the
long lived dynamics that are characteristic of such viral infections are due to
the long range correlations in the temporal fluctuations of the virions. This
model therefore provides an insight into the effects of noise on viral
dynamics.

industry. However, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the stock market

To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well
understand the impact of various indicators on stock prices, we provided a
hybrid prediction model by the combination of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and Recurrent Neural Networks. We investigated two types of aerospace
industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA
could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could
influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted
features, optimisation algorithms, and parameters of the prediction model. The
selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical
features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas
fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation.
The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different
types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term
historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical
data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an
intelligent agent in an automatic stock prediction system, with which, the
financial industry could make a prompt decision for their economic strategies

reproducing the past history of the epidemic in Italy, surfaced in late
February and still ongoing to date, and of validating SUIHTER in terms of its
predicting capabilities. A distinctive feature of the new model is that it
allows a one-to-one calibration strategy between the model compartments and the

that states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal

simultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political
costs, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range
of governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically
democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments'
decisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably
more likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with
higher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic
impact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that
many states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.

  Radiographs and Generalization to Unseen Diseases","Chest radiography (CXR) is the most widely-used thoracic clinical imaging
modality and is crucial for guiding the management of cardiothoracic
conditions. The detection of specific CXR findings has been the main focus of
several artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the wide range of
possible CXR abnormalities makes it impractical to build specific systems to
detect every possible condition. In this work, we developed and evaluated an AI
system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For development, we used a
de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in
India. To assess generalizability, we evaluated our system using 6
international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these
datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2
datasets with tuberculosis and 2 datasets with coronavirus disease 2019. Our
results suggest that the AI system generalizes to new patient populations and
abnormalities. In a simulated workflow where the AI system prioritized abnormal
cases, the turnaround time for abnormal cases reduced by 7-28%. These results
represent an important step towards evaluating whether AI can be safely used to
flag cases in a general setting where previously unseen abnormalities exist.

the spread through geographical scales and the impacts on different locations

municipalities. Contagion follows a stochastic compartmental model for
municipalities; the latter, in turn, interact with each other through recurrent
mobility. As a case of study, we consider the epidemic of COVID-19 in Brazil

have very broad distributions across different geographical locations and

distance from the respective capital cities were predicted to be strong in
several states and weak in others, signaling influences of multiple epidemic
foci propagating towards the inland cities. Responses of different regions to a
same mitigation protocol can vary enormously implying that the policies of
combating the epidemics must be engineered according to the region' specificity

  Infection Segmentation","Purpose: Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 CT scans
plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the
existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are
impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists
are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare
current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different
datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics.
Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in
this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based
on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas,
e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a
fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard
training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the
corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide
more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as
out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for
researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We
achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3\%, 97.7\%, and
67.3\% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6\%, 91.4\%, and

the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning

the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for

  Images","X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning technologies for COVID-19
screening have gained significant traction in AI research since the start of
the coronavirus pandemic. Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19
screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical
setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected
model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of
experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for
COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures.
Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for
train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of
prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data
augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was
trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a
publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results
indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a
meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false
negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While
these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further
support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training
in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these
modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable
screening tool for COVID-19.

media targeted at Chinese and broader Asian communities. However, little is
known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic and the role of
counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and
spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create
COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning
three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over
87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we
train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves
an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate
tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find
that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to
their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards
compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful
users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot
accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers
compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that
hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another,
instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that
hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being
exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate
messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place. Overall,
this work presents a comprehensive overview of anti-Asian hate and counterhate

Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a

proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic
Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it
retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose

indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19
disease. An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a
consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions,
during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand
the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four
candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial
conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to
French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard
statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission
corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the
geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant
parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a
geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the
epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction
policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of
local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent
epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us
to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the
disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to
accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here,
in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is

of respiratory rate monitoring show that the proposed approach in this paper
significantly outperforms other approaches. It is supported by computation time
costs with 2.26 ms per frame, 27.48 ms per frame, 0.78 seconds for convolution
operation, similarity calculation, processing one-minute length respiratory

  simulation and mobile phone data","Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and
predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This
paper presents an approach that combines person-centric data-driven human
mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric
disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of disease
import, of changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility
data), of masks, of indoors vs.\ outdoors leisure activities, and of contact
tracing. Results show that the model is able to credibly track the infection
dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the
contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time.
The model clearly shows the effects of contact reductions, school
closures/vacations, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to
indoors in fall. Sensitivity tests show that all ingredients of the model are
necessary to track the current infection dynamics. One interesting result from
the mobility data is that behavioral changes of the population mostly happened
\textit{before} the government-initiated so-called contact ban came into
effect. Similarly, people started drifting back to their normal activity
patterns \emph{before} the government officially reduced the contact ban. Our
work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations
from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to
investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from
political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different

  Imaging Dataset (POCUS)","With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an
ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist
physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key
role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology,
and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were
demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a
more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19
detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities
around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung
ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277
bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. This
dataset was assembled from various online sources, processed specifically for
deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an
open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network
(POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a
majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular,
the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and
F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access
web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org.
The website deploys the predictive model, allowing to perform predictions on
ultrasound lung images. In addition, it grants medical staff the option to
(bulk) upload their own screenings in order to contribute to the growing public
database of pathological lung ultrasound images.

maps, are critical inputs for a wide range of agriculture and food security
analyses and decisions. However, high-resolution cropland maps are not readily
available for most countries, especially in regions dominated by smallholder
farming (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa). These maps are especially critical in times
of crisis when decision makers need to rapidly design and enact
agriculture-related policies and mitigation strategies, including providing
humanitarian assistance, dispersing targeted aid, or boosting productivity for
farmers. A major challenge for developing crop maps is that many regions do not
have readily accessible ground truth data on croplands necessary for training
and validating predictive models, and field campaigns are not feasible for
collecting labels for rapid response. We present a method for rapid mapping of
croplands in regions where little to no ground data is available. We present
results for this method in Togo, where we delivered a high-resolution (10 m)
cropland map in under 10 days to facilitate rapid response to the COVID-19
pandemic by the Togolese government. This demonstrated a successful transition
of machine learning applications research to operational rapid response in a
real humanitarian crisis. All maps, data, and code are publicly available to

assumptions and are, therefore, prone to model misspecification errors. In this
paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal
prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce
calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In
the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely
exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite
samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and
identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally
independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property
which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if
either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is
estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain
valid and informative for other types of censoring. The validity and efficiency
of our procedure are demonstrated on synthetic data and real COVID-19 data from
the UK Biobank.

will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction

genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable

by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding
inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL
has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$)
being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated
SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which
endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present

  pathogens","In the past two decades, novel viruses capable of airborne transmission have
emerged with alarming frequency, including SARS-CoV-1 in 2003, H1N1 in 2009,
MERS in 2012, and SAR-CoV-2 in 2019. Yet, in many countries, controls on
airborne transmission were not widely adopted until the COVID-19 pandemic. To
optimize strategies for curbing the transmission of existing airborne viruses
and to prepare for outbreaks of novel viruses in the future, the efficacy of
three key controls -- face masks, ventilation, and physical distancing -- must
be well understood. In this study, we used the new Quadrature-based model of
Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD) to quantify the efficacy of controls
across thousands of scenarios that represent the wide variability in factors
governing airborne transmission. We show that, while the efficacy of any
individual control was highly variable among scenarios, the combination of
universal mask-wearing and distancing of at least 1~m reduced the median risk
of initial infection in the susceptible person by 99\% relative to a close
(0.5~m), unmasked conversation. Increasing ventilation rates by 4~air changes
per hour led to further reductions in the median risk of infection by more than
70\% if the two people were distanced by 2~m or more. The combination of face
masks, distancing, and increased ventilation reduced the risk of infection by
more than 98\% in more than 95\% of scenarios. These findings suggest that
layering controls is highly effective for reducing transmission of airborne

health and the world economy. One of the major challenges in controlling the
COVID-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission, which are
elusive and defenseless in most situations. The pathogenicity and virulence of
asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. Based on the genotyping of 20656
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome isolates,
we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T
mutation, i.e., leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) substitution at the residue 37
(L37F) of nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6). By analyzing the distribution of
11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the
hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the
11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders SARS-CoV-2
transmission capacity. Sequence alignment found both NSP6 and residue 37
neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species,
indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine
innate cellular defense against viral infection. Using machine learning and
topological data analysis, we demonstrate that mutation L37F has made NSP6
energetically less stable. The rigidity and flexibility index and several
network models suggest that mutation L37F may have compromised the NSP6
function, leading to a relatively weak SARS-CoV subtype. This assessment is a
good agreement with our genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission
across various countries and regions over the past few months.

segmentation method to assist accurate quantification of COVID 19 pneumonia.
Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly
applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used, which are
the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower lungs. To improve the
segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating
five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical
relevance of the proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the
Quality of Lung Edema (RALE). Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed
dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods
(0.854 0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive

segment and quantify regional distribution of pulmonary opacities in patients

  COVID-19","Masks are used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to limit
transmission and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research about the
impact of mask-wearing in the COVID-19 pandemic has raised formidable interest
across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
mask-wearing in spreading processes over complex networks. This is done by
studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network
model, where nodes can be one of two types (mask-wearing, and
not-mask-wearing). We provide analytical results that accurately predict the
expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the
characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities,
inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of
mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact
network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive
simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the
mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with
mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al.

  chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks","Under the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest
X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,
we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the
robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.

visible in numerous users who were prevented from participating in and

from anomalies in the communication network. The proposed methodology includes
establishing a theoretical basis on DDoS and flash crowd event traffic,
defining a laboratory testbed setup for data acquisition, development of DDoS

  patients reveals temporal evolution of distinctive coagulopathy signatures","Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and their triangulation
with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from
the providers notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to
advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg
patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a
two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing
dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation
and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma
fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of
patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these
measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with
declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower
and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented
curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events
after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet
reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal
trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19
associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes
longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural
network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study
demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each

  to flatten the curve of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan","This paper presents the assessment of time-dependent national-level
restrictions and control actions and their effects in fighting the COVID-19
pandemic. By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of
COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control
actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood.
This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control
the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic
population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into
consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters,
especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one
of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this
pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model
can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical
optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in
the news platforms. In this paper, the model is verified using a case study
based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in
simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints)
parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with
time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the
actual situations better.

  Approach","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing interest in the
modeling and analysis of infectious diseases. The pandemic has made a
significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The
past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic
spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework
to study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework
extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex
networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically
equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities
based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics.
Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is
reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the
coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a
given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given
epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic
substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent
network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop
structure-preserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent
properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The
resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19
statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our
framework.

the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental
parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and
isolation of infected individuals ($\alpha$) and the ratio of people isolated
over the total infected ones ($p$). The evolution is more sensitive to the
$p-$parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts
the second wave before the former vanishes. This effect is intrinsic of
extensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.

  Covid-19 epidemic","Various measures have been taken in different countries to mitigate the
Covid-19 epidemic. But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand
well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by
their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they
taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some
quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the
well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a
pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple
and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff
between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming
a given number of phases for the epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health
and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of
each phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical
analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be
applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that
being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in
France would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss of 231
billion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion
euro. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the
effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically,
whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health
impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been
more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the
natural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating
measures every month over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more
appropriate.

rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of
new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing
also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a
new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the
current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA
approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative
viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many
existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and
likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key
proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry
into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion
from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to
combat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the
binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues

carried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server. Further
studies on a broad range of FDA approved drugs including few more protein

  reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing
  feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread
outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health
concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and
SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with
SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike
glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization
between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity
in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended
structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor
binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be
proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and
entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that
the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability
and transmission.

  Utilisation Predictions in New York State","Forecasting models have been influential in shaping decision-making in the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is concern that their predictions may have
been misleading. Here, we dissect the predictions made by four models for the
daily COVID-19 death counts between March 25 and June 5 in New York state, as
well as the predictions of ICU bed utilisation made by the influential IHME
model. We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the
uncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the ""ground
truth"" data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained.
Three different data sources were used by these models, and these had
substantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data
sources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For
accuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly. Only 10.2% of the
predictions fell within 10% of their training ground truth, irrespective of
distance into the future. For accurate assessment of uncertainty, only one
model matched relatively well the nominal 95% coverage, but that model did not
start predictions until April 16, thus had no impact on early, major decisions.
For ICU bed utilisation, the IHME model was highly inaccurate; the point
estimates only started to match ground truth after the pandemic wave had
started to wane. We conclude that trustworthy models require trustworthy input
data to be trained upon. Moreover, models need to be subjected to prespecified
real time performance tests, before their results are provided to policy makers
and public health officials.

COVID-19 has been automated contact tracing. Since proximity data can be

for automated contact tracing providing a major gain over a manual

automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a
pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and
social structures required for automated contact tracing to work. We display
the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequate sampling of the population,
which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact
with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a
significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.
We conclude that relying largely on automated contact tracing without
population-wide participation to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
can be counterproductive and allow the pandemic to spread unchecked. The
simultaneous implementation of various mitigation methods along with automated
contact tracing is necessary for reaching an optimal solution to contain the
pandemic.

state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19
hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to
implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal
precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the
COVID-19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a

differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data
from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S.
The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among
county clusters in Arizona and human actives on the transmission of COVID-19.
The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable
(above 94\%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions
such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases

the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 there has been a rush for developing
Artificial Intelligence techniques for expert-level disease identification on
Chest X-ray data. In particular, the use of deep supervised learning has become
the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily
dependent on the availability of a large and representative labelled dataset.
The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and
especially imposes a great challenge for a novel disease. Semi-supervised
learning has shown the ability to match the incredible performance of
supervised models whilst requiring a small fraction of the labelled examples.
This makes the semi-supervised paradigm an attractive option for identifying
COVID-19. In this work, we introduce a graph based deep semi-supervised
framework for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Our framework introduces
an optimisation model for graph diffusion that reinforces the natural relation
among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled data. We then connect the

scheme in a deep net. We demonstrate, through our experiments, that our model
is able to outperform the current leading supervised model with a tiny fraction

The UK's recovery is heavily weighted towards the ""home counties"" around outer
London and the South. We observe a stark contrast between strong online
spending growth while offline spending contracts. The strongest recovery in
spending is seen in online spending in the ""commuter belt"" areas in outer
London and the surrounding localities and also in areas of high second home
ownership, where working from home (including working from second homes) has
significantly displaced the location of spending. Year-on-year spending growth

(5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks

  mathematical approach","Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been critical in the fight against the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, these sanitary measures have been partially lifted
due to socioeconomic factors causing a worrisome rebound of the epidemic in
several countries. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of the mitigation
implemented to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mexican territory
during 2020. We also investigate to what extent the initial deployment of the
vaccine will help to mitigate the pandemic and reduce the need for social
distancing and other mobility restrictions. Our modeling approach is based on a
simple mechanistic Kermack-McKendrick-type model. To quantify the effect of
NPIs, we perform a monthly Bayesian inference using officially published data.
The results suggest that in the absence of the sanitary measures, the
cumulative number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths would have been
at least twice the official number. Moreover, for low vaccine coverage levels,
relaxing NPIs may dramatically increase the disease burden; therefore, safety
measures are of critical importance at the early stages of vaccination. The
simulations also suggest that it may be more desirable to employ a vaccine with
low efficacy but reach a high coverage than a vaccine with high effectiveness
but low coverage levels. This supports the hypothesis that single doses to more
individuals will be more effective than two doses for every person.

research, we draw on data from the Australian journalism jobs market from
January 2012 until March 2020. Using Data Science and Machine Learning
techniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data
comprising 3,698 journalist job ads from a corpus of over 8 million Australian
job ads; and official employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Having matched and analysed both sources, we address both the demand for and
supply of journalists in Australia over this critical period. The data show
that the crisis is real, but there are also surprises. Counter-intuitively, the
number of journalism job ads in Australia rose from 2012 until 2016, before
falling into decline. Less surprisingly, for the entire period studied the
figures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large and erratic
fluctuations. The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has significantly
worsened the crisis. We then tease out more granular findings, including: that
there are now more women than men journalists in Australia, but that gender
inequity is worsening, with women journalists getting younger and worse-paid
just as men journalists are, on average, getting older and better-paid; that,
despite the crisis besetting the industry, the demand for journalism skills has
increased; and that, perhaps concerningly, the skills sought by journalism job
ads increasingly include social media and generalist communications.

it can be used to detect trending topics from any other social media and any

recovery settings, the 2020 NSF CPS Challenge was positioned around the launch
of the MARS 2020 rover and sUAS duo. This paper discusses perception and
trajectory planning for sample recovery by sUAS in a simulation environment.
Out of a total of five teams that participated, the results of the top two
teams have been discussed. The OpenUAV cloud simulation framework deployed on
the Cyber-Physical Systems Virtual Organization (CPS-VO) allowed the teams to
work remotely over a month during the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and simulate
autonomous exploration algorithms. Remote simulation enabled teams across the
globe to collaborate in experiments. The two teams approached the task of probe
search, probe recovery, and landing on a moving target differently. This paper
is a summary of teams' insights and lessons learned, as they chose from a wide
range of perception sensors and algorithms.

  Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Generalized Spatial SEIRD Model","In this paper, I study epidemic diffusion in a generalized spatial SEIRD
model, where individuals are initially connected in a social or geographical
network. As the virus spreads in the network, the structure of interactions
between people may endogenously change over time, due to quarantining measures
and/or spatial-distancing policies. I explore via simulations the dynamic
properties of the co-evolutionary process dynamically linking disease diffusion
and network properties. Results suggest that, in order to predict how epidemic
phenomena evolve in networked populations, it is not enough to focus on the
properties of initial interaction structures. Indeed, the co-evolution of
network structures and compartment shares strongly shape the process of
epidemic diffusion, especially in terms of its speed. Furthermore, I show that
the timing and features of spatial-distancing policies may dramatically
influence their effectiveness.

life years saved against the life years lost due to the consequences of

for those to other diseases. Against this background Verity et al. (2020,

statistical modelling to infer the IFR for COVID-19. We have attempted an
in-depth statistical review of their approach, to identify to what extent the
data are sufficiently informative about the IFR to play a greater role than the
modelling assumptions, and have tried to identify those assumptions that appear
to play a key role. Given the difficulties with other data sources, we provide
a crude alternative analysis based on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship data and
case data from China, and argue that, given the data problems, modelling of

is near direct measurement of epidemic size by PCR and/or antibody testing of

teams when playing team sports. One of the most obvious underlying reasons, the
presence of supporting fans has mostly disappeared in major leagues with the
emergence of COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates with the help of

on the game outcome. Our findings reveal that under no allowance of spectators
the home teams' performance is substantially lower than under normal
circumstances, even performing slightly worse than the visiting teams. On the
other hand, when a limited amount of spectators are allowed to the game, the
home teams' performance is no longer significantly different than what we
observe with full stadiums. This suggests that from a psychological point of

  on Laser Interferometry","The author discusses the laser interference method to measure the size of
small bio-particles: extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and viruses of
nanometer scale in flow cytometry. By introducing a new laser configuration in
place of conventional optical system of the flow cytometry, the interference
fringe (periodic intensity modulation) is created inside the flow which
provides a calibrated scale for the size measurement. The fringe pitch is
precisely determined by the crossing angle of laser beams and the wavelength.
The transverse size of the beam spot can be much larger than wavelength, for
example, 30 micro-meters, where the flow cell design in conventional system can
be used with moderated dimensional tolerance. The interaction length of sample
with laser becomes longer: ~30 micro-meter and thus the scattering light and
fluorescent light in case of labeled particle becomes much higher. Importantly,
those signals are modulated in MHz frequency range associated with the periodic
intensity modulation of the interference fringe. By measuring modulation depth,
we can determine the particle size. We may utilize a bandpass filter or the
digital signal processing of FFT, and thus we can drastically improve S/N
ratio. This is because of the narrow spectrum of signal and thus effectively
eliminates noise from various debris contained in the sample, and also low
frequency shot noise in the photo detector signal. Thanks to the
above-mentioned merits, it will be possible to measure the size of EVs and
exosomes in particle-by-particle basis in reliable dimensional scale at
nano-meter resolution. It will be also possible to realize the fast virus
detection system for screening passengers in the airport at the current
pandemic of COVID-19 and in future.

another through social contact networks. In today's interconnected global
society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as
exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great
practical relevance to investigate the network trans-mission of contagious
diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely
studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the
so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in
determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will
cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds
from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major
challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the
epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally
efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu
modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk
sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small
fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and
demonstrate their empirical superiority.

through their engagement with issues, and may derive their legitimacy either

influencers on the side of the government, on three other contentious issues
around citizenship, Kashmir's statehood, and farmers' protests, it is mainly
government-aligned fan accounts that amplify the incumbent's positions. We

This has been a major issue for developing ML models for the

particularly within electronic health records (EHR) research. Conventional
approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) that often suffers from poor

improves the performance of CEL especially for imbalanced EHR data and the
related COVID-19 analyses. This study has been approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We use EHR data
from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict
mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential
architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models
are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and
restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently
outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with
differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For
the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is
able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL
in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to
three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature
importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used
for EHR ML work in general.

(i) The analyses on the subset of SARS-CoV-2 literature identified studies
published prior to 2020 that have now proven highly instrumental in the
development of various clusters of publications linked to SARS-CoV-2. In
particular, the so-called sleeping beauties of the coronavirus literature with
an awakening in 2020 were identified, i.e., previously published studies of
this literature that had remained relatively unnoticed for several years but
gained sudden traction in 2020 in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. (ii) The
subset of 2020 SARS-CoV-2 articles is bibliographically distant from the rest
of this literature published prior to 2020. Individual articles of the

of bibliographic coupling within the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 cluster is much poorer

part, be explained by the higher diversity of topics that are studied in

undertaken during peace time or prior to a disease outbreak could suddenly play

  Consensus, information, dissent, and lockdown life","Purpose: Public attitudes towards COVID-19 and social distancing are critical
in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public
reactions and information dissemination in all major forms, including on social
media. This article investigates important issues reflected on Twitter in the
early stages of the public reaction to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: A
thematic analysis of the most retweeted English-language tweets mentioning
COVID-19 during March 10-29, 2020. Findings: The main themes identified for the
87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life;
attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with
COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research
limitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through
unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build
support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed
support for key workers, and helped each other cope with social isolation. A
few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government
messages sometimes failed. Practical implications: Public health campaigns in
future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support
campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised
politics and ignored practical implementation issues. Originality/value: This
is the first qualitative analysis of general COVID-19-related retweeting.

  Lockdown Measures on Local Air Quality","The COVID-19 related lockdown measures offer a unique opportunity to
understand how changes in economic activity and traffic affect ambient air
quality and how much pollution reduction potential can the society offer
through digitalization and mobilitylimiting policies. In this work, we estimate
pollution reduction over the lockdown period by using the measurements from
ground air pollution monitoring stations, training a long-term prediction model
and comparing its predictions to measured values over the lockdown month.We
show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the data from air
pollution measurement stations in Switzerland and in China: evaluate up to
-15.8% / +34.4% change in NO2 / PM10 in Zurich; -35.3 % / -3.5 % and -42.4 % /
-34.7 % in NO2 / PM2.5 in Beijing and Wuhan respectively. Our reduction
estimates are consistent with recent publications, yet in contrast to prior
works, our method takes local weather into account. What can we learn from
pollution emissions during lockdown? The lockdown period was too short to train
meaningful models from scratch. To tackle this problem, we use transfer
learning to newly fit only traffic-dependent variables. We show that the
resulting models are accurate, suitable for an analysis of the post-lockdown
period and capable of estimating the future air pollution reduction potential.

  and Twitter in India during COVID-19 Infodemic","COVID-19 infodemic has been spreading faster than the pandemic itself. The
misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's
health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of
information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of
misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns
resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp
45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its
direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the
psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official
bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look
at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified
the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram
based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related
emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related
emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag
relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official

bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical
Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker

also allows estimation of the number of infections over time in the absence of

became epidemic hotspots during the second wave of the spread of COVID-19 in
early 2021. Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic
causes, it remains unclear how this pattern could be accounted for from a
quantitative approach. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard
index (EpiRank), we came up with a mathematical explanation for this
phenomenon. The index is constructed from epidemic simulations on a multi-layer
transportation network model on top of local SEIR transmission dynamics, which
characterizes intra- and inter-city compartment population flow with a detailed
mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted cities
possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large regional
population and small inter-city transportation. The proposed index, dynamic and
applicable to different epidemic settings, could be a useful indicator for the
risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China; the
model framework is modularized and can be adapted for other nations without
much difficulty.

Europe) have ended, while resurgences of cases have been identified in several
among them. The modeling results clearly show longer after-peak trajectories in
western countries, in contrast to most provinces in China where the after-peak
trajectory is characterized by a much faster decay. We identified three groups
of countries in different level of outbreak progress, and provide informative

effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed

the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were
implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would
have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of
stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of

epidemic would have been, and the stronger the interventions would have been
required.

  Covid-19 infection numbers?","We derive an analytic expression describing how health costs and death counts
of the Covid-19 pandemic change over time as vaccination proceeds. Meanwhile,
the disease may continue to spread exponentially unless checked by Non
Pharmacological Interventions (NPI). The key factors are that the mortality
risk from a Covid-19 infection increases exponentially with age and that the
sizes of age cohorts decrease linearly at the top of the population pyramid.
Taking these factors into account, we derive an expression for a critical
threshold, which determines the minimal speed a vaccination campaign needs to
have in order to be able to keep fatalities from rising. Younger countries with
fast vaccination campaigns find it substantially easier to reach this threshold
than countries with aged population and slower vaccination. We find that for EU
countries it will take some time to reach this threshold, given that the new,
now dominant, mutations, have a significantly higher infection rate. The
urgency of accelerating vaccination is increased by early evidence that the new
strains also have a higher mortality risk. We also find that protecting the
over 60 years old, which constitute one quarter of the EU population, would
reduce the loss of live by 95 percent.

  Support","Biometrics and biometric-enabled decision support systems (DSS) have become a
mandatory part of complex dynamic systems such as security checkpoints,
personal health monitoring systems, autonomous robots, and epidemiological
surveillance. Risk, trust, and bias (R-T-B) are emerging measures of
performance of such systems. The existing studies on the R-T-B impact on system
performance mostly ignore the complementary nature of R-T-B and their causal
relationships, for instance, risk of trust, risk of bias, and risk of trust
over biases. This paper offers a complete taxonomy of the R-T-B causal
performance regulators for the biometric-enabled DSS. The proposed novel
taxonomy links the R-T-B assessment to the causal inference mechanism for
reasoning in decision making. Practical details of the R-T-B assessment in the
DSS are demonstrated using the experiments of assessing the trust in synthetic
biometric and the risk of bias in face biometrics. The paper also outlines the
emerging applications of the proposed approach beyond biometrics, including
decision support for epidemiological surveillance such as for COVID-19
pandemics.

transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protective
measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of
time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a
robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all
US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the
daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual
to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community. We found that
shortening by $5\%$ of the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around
$39\%$ (or $78$K, $95\%$ CI: $[66$K $, 89$K $]$) of the COVID-19 associated
deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our findings also indicate that
reducing infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more
pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number close to 1,
suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures,
such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission
rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level map for local officials
to determine optimal policy responses and for the public to better understand
the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 on each day.

COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing measures based on the example of
Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of
two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model
of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and
validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control
policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to
simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more
realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy
that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a
reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant
parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using
interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and
safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are
inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social
distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing
that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the
COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the
number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of
social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social
distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than
opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.

dynamics of COVID-19, that is we propose the heterogeneous SQAIRD model where
COVID-19 spreads over a population of economic agents, namely: the elderly,
adults and young people. We then compute and simulate an optimal control
problem faced by a Government, where its objective is to minimize the costs
generated by the pandemics using as control a compulsory quarantine measure
(that is, a lockdown). We first analyze the problem from a theoretical
perspective, claiming that different lockdown policies (total lockdown, no
lockdown or partial lockdown) may justified by different cost (concave or
convex) structures of the economies. We then focus on a particular cost
structure (convex costs) and we simulate a targeted optimal policy vs. a
uniform optimal policy, by dividing the whole population in three demographic
groups (young, adults and old). We also simulate the dynamic of the pandemic
with no policy implemented. Simulations highlighted the fact that: a) a policy
of lockdown is always better than the \emph{laissez faire} policy, because it
limits the costs that the pandemic generates in an uncontrolled situation; b) a
targeted policy based on age of the individuals outperforms a uniform policy in
terms of costs that it generates, being a targeted policy less costly and
equally effective in the control of the pandemic.

approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than
existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to
various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.

  Risk Estimation Based on Contact Data","We present CRISP (COVID-19 Risk Score Prediction), a probabilistic graphical
model for COVID-19 infection spread through a population based on the SEIR
model where we assume access to (1) mutual contacts between pairs of
individuals across time across various channels (e.g., Bluetooth contact
traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure
and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state
for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed,
infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer
contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm
uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each
individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection
status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with
simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the
reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and
recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due
to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and
inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy
measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a
test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19
infection spread based on individual-level contact data; most epidemic models
are macro-level models that reason over entire populations. The implementation

COVID-19 pandemic. It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers'
likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats.
However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that
the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the
clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and
take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes
lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the
reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding
processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using
pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show
that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared
with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a
typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping
middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show
that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this
case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises
from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Our
results suggest that airlines either revert to their earlier boarding process
or adopt the better random process.

around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people

the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting
this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the
fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed
specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with
COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning
models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We
first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available
datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by
board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms
was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including
ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease
in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining
3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98%
($\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity
and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix
of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions
potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain
most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While
the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a
larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy
rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are

from home affects their productivity.
  In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity
between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative
analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one
of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four
thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of
these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due
to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts
on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of
builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has
different impacts on projects with different characteristics including
programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has
a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally,
we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these
findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some
reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.

the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of
bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper
explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative
findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data

the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find
that the infection fatality rate in Italy is substantially lower than reported.

mitigate pandemic negative effects on engineering education, especially for
vulnerable, disadvantaged, and underrepresented students who have to deal with

  Uncertainty","This paper develops a stochastic programming framework for multi-agent
systems where task decomposition, assignment, and scheduling problems are
simultaneously optimized. Due to their inherent flexibility and robustness,
multi-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that
involve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works
assume a unique way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned
to the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles
can vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear
how uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be
systematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A
representation for complex tasks is proposed to avoid the non-convex task
decomposition enumeration: agent capabilities are represented as a vector of
random distributions, and task requirements are verified by a generalizable
binary function. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is chosen as a metric in
the objective function to generate robust plans. An efficient algorithm is
described to solve the model, and the whole framework is evaluated in two
different practical test cases: capture-the-flag and robotic service
coordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19). Results demonstrate that the
framework is scalable, generalizable, and provides low-cost plans that ensure a
high probability of success.

already become established by late January 2020, and the disease spread out to

declined following the introduction of human mobility restrictions across

  sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Social media analysis has become a common approach to assess public opinion
on various topics, including those about health, in near real-time. The growing
volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine
learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of
social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical
problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when
applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be
particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of
interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the
effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments
expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined
considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on
pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift.
Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address concept
drift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematic
misclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis when
the underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly.

model, which can give more accurate and robust short-term predictions of

projection. Different from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed
(SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling
with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses
short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the

adaptive real-time changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social
behavior of populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are
trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our
differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based time-varying SEIR
model. Since SEIR model still is a physics-based disease transmission model,
its near-term (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental for
policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business
activity policy change in a real-time. This is especially useful if the

a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to
ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to
ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol,
which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol,
respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the
example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD,
which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the
framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main
driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational

human mobility. On the other hand, the control strategies based on mobility
restrictions are generally unpopular and costly. These high social and economic
costs make it very important to design global protocols where the cost is
minimized and effects maximized. In this work, we calculate the percolation
threshold of the spread in a network of a disease. In particular, we found the
number of roads to close and regions to isolate in the Puebla State, Mexico, to
avoid the global spread of COVID-19. Computational simulations taking into

  Prevention Strategies","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 spreading, the number of studies on the
epidemic models increased dramatically. It is important for policy makers to
know how the disease will spread, and what are the effects of the policies and
environment on the spreading. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the
standard infectious disease models: (a) We consider the prevention measures
adopted based on the current severity of the infection, those measures are
adaptive and change over time. (b) Multiple cities and regions are considered,
with population movements between those cities/regions, while taking into
account that each region may have different prevention measures. While the
adaptive measures and mobility of the population were often observed during the
pandemic, these effects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the
classical epidemic models. The model we propose gives rise to a plateau
phenomenon: the number of people infected by the disease stay at the same level
during an extended period of time. We show what are conditions needs to be met
in order for the spreading to exhibit a plateau period, and we show that this
phenomenon is interdependent: when considering multiples cities, the conditions
are different from a single city. We verify from the real-world data that
plateau phenomenon does exists in many regions of the world in the current
COVID-19 development. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis on the plateau
phenomenon for the single-city model, and derive a series of results on the
emergence and ending of the plateau, and on the height and length of the
plateau. Our theoretical results match well with our empirical findings.

particularly challenging to understand: (i) the great geographical differences
in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality which were found in the
different phases of the epidemic progression, and (ii) the potential role of
the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the
progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both
aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that in the subject-to-subject
transfer SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the
source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune
reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific
antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood
type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood
type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the
observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an
epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood
types are taken into account and compare our model outcomes with the exiting
worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which
strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19
infection.

for inference, prediction and optimisation of NPIs in age- and
contact-structured epidemiological compartment models. This report outlines the
rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations
and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss
library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as
master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run
transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental
subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and
allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and
forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as
available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be
weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact
of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological
data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to
optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are
included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed

structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes

combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,
could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to
detailed epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for
research to address today's COVID-19 crisis, and to plan for future pandemics.

  Networks","SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus, is a viral contagious
disease that is infected by a novel coronavirus, and has been rapidly spreading
across the globe. It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce
spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently.
According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is
the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer
vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can
predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The
accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such
as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of
data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease
is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the
available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by
utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and
negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded
that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19
positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based
classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater
accuracy.

  matter","I critique a recent analysis (Miles, Stedman & Heald, 2020) of COVID-19
lockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.
(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit
of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks
from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the
benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000
deaths weekly by mid-September.
  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and
cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut
off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they
assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths
and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes
that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or
social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary
lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under
these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of
serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for
survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in
deaths.
  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without
estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness
costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.

  the Influence of App Design and Individual Difference on Contact-Tracing App
  Adoption Intention","Smartphone-based contact-tracing apps are a promising solution to help scale
up the conventional contact-tracing process. However, low adoption rates have
become a major issue that prevents these apps from achieving their full
potential. In this paper, we present a national-scale survey experiment ($N =
1963$) in the U.S. to investigate the effects of app design choices and
individual differences on COVID-19 contact-tracing app adoption intentions. We
found that individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk
perceptions, general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic
factors played a more important role than app design choices such as
decentralized design vs. centralized design, location use, app providers, and
the presentation of security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the
different preferences in different sub-populations which may lead to an
inequality of acceptance to certain app design choices (e.g., developed by
state health authorities vs. a large tech company) among different groups of
people (e.g., people living in rural areas vs. people living in urban areas).
Our mediation analysis showed that one's perception of the public health
benefits offered by the app and the adoption willingness of other people had a
larger effect in explaining the observed effects of app design choices and
individual differences than one's perception of the app's security and privacy
risks. With these findings, we discuss practical implications on the design,
marketing, and deployment of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps in the U.S.

""preferential testing."" An open question is whether or not it is possible to
reliably estimate the IFR without any specific knowledge about the degree to

partial identifiability approach, formulating clearly where deliberate prior
assumptions can be made and presenting a Bayesian model which pools information
from different samples. When the model is fit to European data obtained from

These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction

advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise

precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical

generates scientifically promising ""alien"" hypotheses unlikely to be imagined

scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias,
these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by

before they spread out. An important reason behind this might be that
epidemiological barriers consisting in stopping symptomatic people are likely
to fail because of the contagion time before onset, mild cases and/or
asymptomatics carriers. Motivated by these special COVID-19 features, we study
a scheme for containing an outbreak in a city that consists in adding an extra
firewall block between the outbreak and the rest of the city. We implement a
coupled compartment model with stochastic noise to simulate a localized
outbreak that is partially isolated and analyze its evolution with and without
firewall for different plausible model parameters. We explore how further
improvements could be achieved if the epidemic evolution would trigger policy
changes for the flux and/or lock-down in the different blocks. Our results show
that a substantial improvement is obtained by merely adding an extra block
between the outbreak and the bulk of the city.

dynamic networks, and has many important applications, including knowledge
graphs, citation networks to social networks. Graphs of this type are usually
large-scale but only a small subset of vertices are related in downstream
tasks. Current methods are too expensive to this setting as the complexity is
at best linear-dependent on both the number of nodes and edges. In this paper,
we propose a new method, namely Dynamic Personalized PageRank Embedding
(\textsc{DynamicPPE}) for learning a target subset of node representations over
large-scale dynamic networks. Based on recent advances in local node embedding
and a novel computation of dynamic personalized PageRank vector (PPV),
\textsc{DynamicPPE} has two key ingredients: 1) the per-PPV complexity is
$\mathcal{O}(m \bar{d} / \epsilon)$ where $m,\bar{d}$, and $\epsilon$ are the
number of edges received, average degree, global precision error respectively.
Thus, the per-edge event update of a single node is only dependent on $\bar{d}$
in average; and 2) by using these high quality PPVs and hash kernels, the
learned embeddings have properties of both locality and global consistency.
These two make it possible to capture the evolution of graph structure
effectively. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed method over large-scale dynamic networks. We apply
\textsc{DynamicPPE} to capture the embedding change of Chinese cities in the
Wikipedia graph during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). Our results show that these
representations successfully encode the dynamics of the Wikipedia graph.

need for simple and efficient prevention strategies that can be rapidly
implemented to mitigate infection risks. Various surfaces have a long history
of antimicrobial properties and are well described for the prevention of
bacterial infections. However, their effect on many viruses has not been
studied in depth. In the context of COVID-19, several surfaces, including
copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) coatings have been described as efficient antiviral
measures that can easily be implemented to slow viral transmission. In this
study, we detected antiviral properties against Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces, which were coated with Cu by
magnetron sputtering. However, no effect of Ag on viral titers was observed, in
clear contrast to its well-known antibacterial properties. Further enhancement
of Ag ion release kinetics based on an electrochemical sacrificial anode
mechanism did not increase antiviral activity. These results clearly
demonstrate that Cu and Ag thin film systems display significant differences in
antiviral and antibacterial properties which need to be considered upon
implementation.

inequality, indicating self-similarity across scales. Neighbourhoods with slums
are found to contain the highest density of cases across all cities under
consideration, revealing that slums constitute the most at-risk urban locations
in this epidemic. We present a stochastic network model to study the spread of
a respiratory epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human
contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for a city with two kinds of
neighbourhoods - slum and non-slum. The model reproduces observed empirical
outcomes for a broad set of parameter values - reflecting the potential
validity of these findings for epidemic spread in general, especially across
cities of the developing world. We also find that distribution of cases becomes
less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative
caseloads are worse for slum neighbourhoods than non-slums at the end of an
epidemic. Large slums in the developing world therefore contain the most
vulnerable populations in an outbreak, and the continuing growth of

surveillance. Spatio-temporal disease mapping models, which allow dealing with
highly disaggregated spatial and temporal units of analysis, are a priority in
this sense. Spatio-temporal models provide a geographically detailed and
temporally updated overview of the current state of the pandemics, making
public health interventions to be more effective. Moreover, the use of
spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context,
facilitates estimating newly demanded epidemiological indicators, such as the
instantaneous reproduction number (R_t), even for small areas. This, in turn,
allows to adapt traditional disease mapping models to these new circumstancies
and make their results more useful in this particular context.
  In this paper we propose a new spatio-temporal disease mapping model,
particularly suited to Covid-19 surveillance. As an additional result, we
derive instantaneous reproduction number estimates for small areas, enabling
monitoring this parameter with a high spatial disaggregation. We illustrate the
use of our proposal with the separate study of the disease pandemics in two

  for interdisciplinary research","Research on infodemics, i.e., the rapid spread of (mis)information related to
a hazardous event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires the integration of a
multiplicity of scientific disciplines. The dynamics emerging from infodemics
have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. In order to react
appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and
Economics to understand the dynamics emerging from it. In the short run,
dynamics might lead to an adaptation in household spending or to a shift in
buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run, changes in
investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that
the dynamics emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as
information and misinformation accessible for individuals and the formation and
revision of beliefs. (Mis)information accessible to individuals is, amongst
others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized
information, while automated fact-checking algorithms can help reduce the
amount of circulating misinformation. The formation and revision of individual
(and probably false) beliefs and individual fact-checking and interpretation of
information are heavily affected by linguistic patterns inherent to information
during pandemics and infodemics and further factors, such as affect, intuition

network to quantify airspace disease on paired CXRs; and 2) compare the
DRR-trained CNN to expert human readers in the CXR evaluation of patients with

  Materials and Methods: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19
patients (with positive RT-PCR), from March-May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in
the northeastern USA, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hrs. The ground
truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19 related AD (POv) was established by
manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3D masks were projected into 2D
anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to compute
area-based AD percentage (POa). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was
trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 patients, automatically segmenting lungs, AD and quantifying
POa on CXR. CNN POa results were compared to POa quantified on CXR by two
expert readers and to the POv ground-truth, by computing correlations and mean
absolute errors.
  Results: Bootstrap mean absolute error (MAE) and correlations between POa and
POv were 11.98% [11.05%-12.47%] and 0.77 [0.70-0.82] for average of expert
readers, and 9.56%-9.78% [8.83%-10.22%] and 0.78-0.81 [0.73-0.85] for the CNN,

  Conclusion: Our CNN trained with DRR using CT-derived airspace quantification
achieved expert radiologist level of accuracy in the quantification of airspace

  spread model","In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of
the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is
modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying
pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary
infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the
model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious
individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A
Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the
relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new
data on the number of new infections and disease related death become
available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate
is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of
the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The
sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the
uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction
number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and
symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the
quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that
plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we
apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from
several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the
proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within
both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the
mitigation measures.

COVID-19 growth curves in different cities, which remain inadequately explained
by standard epidemiological models, is critical for medical supply and
treatment. Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions
to slow the spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social
distancing, quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in
intra-city mobility and viral transmission. Moreover, recent work associating
coronavirus with human mobility and detailed movement data suggest the need to
consider urban mobility in disease forecasts. Here we show that by
incorporating intra-city mobility and policy adoption into a novel
metapopulation SEIR model, we can accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth
patterns in U.S. cities ($R^2$ = 0.990). Estimated mobility change due to
policy interventions is consistent with empirical observation from Apple
Mobility Trends Reports (Pearson's R = 0.872), suggesting the utility of
model-based predictions where data are limited. Our model also reproduces urban
""superspreading"", where a few neighborhoods account for most secondary
infections across urban space, arising from uneven neighborhood populations and
heightened intra-city churn in popular neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can
facilitate location-aware mobility reduction policy that more effectively
mitigates disease transmission at similar social cost. Finally, we demonstrate
our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic and simulation framework that
informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical interventions policies.

loss of efficiency induced by a decentralized control or local management of a
global epidemic. Each player typically represents a region or a country which
is assumed to choose its control action to implement a tradeoff between
socioeconomic aspects and the health aspect. We conduct the Nash equilibrium
analysis of this game. Since the analysis is not trivial in general, sufficient
conditions for existence and uniqueness are provided. Then we quantify through
numerical results the loss induced by decentralization, measured in terms of
price of anarchy (PoA) and price of connectedness (PoC). These results allow
one to clearly identify scenarios where decentralization is acceptable or not

  2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role
of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking
into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters
determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using
data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is
capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of
confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The
drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different
countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as
the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the
occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating
its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that
insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented
infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that
country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model
predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did
not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is
that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a
non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been
deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently
imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving
into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting
the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the
hidden individuals.

when taking decisions about their young children, and likely also when advising
other family members such as elderly relatives. Minimizing malignant online
influences is therefore crucial to securing their assent for policies ranging
from vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, to
household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G

communities during the pandemic, has led to non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories
(e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstream
parent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduits
between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more
palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these
inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective
of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why
Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of
non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why
targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable

mainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping against
establishment guidance. Our conclusions should also apply to other social media

demonstrate an equivalent formalism of computation using a general time

within the framework of supersymmetry. For the Harmonic Oscillator case we
obtain similar periodic time dependence but dissimilar parameter dependences
compared to the results obtained from both micro-canonical and canonical
ensembles in quantum mechanics without supersymmetry. On the other hand, for
one dimensional potential well problem we found significantly different time
scale and the other parameter dependence compared to the results obtained from
non-supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, to establish the consistency of

measures effectively slowed disease transmission in many countries in Europe
and Asia, but the same benefits have not been observed in some developing
countries such as Brazil. In part, this is due to a failure to organise
systematic testing campaigns at nationwide or even regional levels. To gain
effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries,
particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by
an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities.
The economic infrastructure of the country, often concentrated in a few cities,
forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces
strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission. In the present study, we
develop a smart testing strategy to identify geographic regions where COVID-19
testing could most effectively be deployed to limit further disease
transmission. The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and
demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and
city-specific social-distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity
of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution,
we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to
show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while
reducing the need for social-distancing measures, thus returning life to a
so-called new normal, even when testing capacity is limited.

  austere COVID-19 pandemic population lockdown","A computational methodology is introduced to minimize infection opportunities
for people suffering some degree of lockdown in response to a pandemic, as is
the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Persons use their mobile phone or computational
device to request trips to places of their need or interest indicating a rough
time of day: `morning', `afternoon', `night' or `any time' when they would like
to undertake these outings as well as the desired place to visit. An artificial
intelligence methodology which is a variant of Genetic Programming studies all
requests and responds with specific time allocations for such visits that
minimize the overall risks of infection, hospitalization and death of people. A
number of alternatives for this computation are presented and results of
numerical experiments involving over 230 people of various ages and background
health levels in over 1700 visits that take place over three consecutive days.
A novel partial infection model is introduced to discuss these proof of concept
solutions which are compared to round robin uninformed time scheduling for
visits to places. The computations indicate vast improvements with far fewer
dead and hospitalized. These auger well for a more realistic study using
accurate infection models with the view to test deployment in the real world.
The input that drives the infection model is the degree of infection by
taxonomic class, such as the information that may arise from population testing
for COVID-19 or, alternatively, any contamination model. The taxonomy class
assumed in the computations is the likely level of infection by age group.

process is a common problem in signal processing, with prominent examples in a
wide range of fields. An important example of this problem is the nowcasting of
COVID-19 mortality: given a stream of reported counts of daily deaths, can we
correct for the delays in reporting to paint an accurate picture of the
present, with uncertainty? Without this correction, raw data will often mislead
by suggesting an improving situation. We present a flexible approach using a
latent Gaussian process that is capable of describing the changing
auto-correlation structure present in the reporting time-delay surface. This
approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for the estimated
nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification such as
the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on a
challenging real dataset from Brazil. Our experiments show that Gaussian
process nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and
against a small sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has
substantial practical utility in disease modelling -- by applying our approach
to COVID-19 mortality data from Brazil, where reporting delays are large, we
can make informative predictions on important epidemiological quantities such
as the current effective reproduction number.

Systemic health, social and economic disparities have put the minorities and
economically poor communities at a higher risk than others. There is an
immediate requirement to develop a reliable measure of county-level
vulnerabilities that can capture the heterogeneity of both vulnerable
communities and the COVID19 pandemic. This study reports a COVID19
Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identification and mapping of vulnerable
counties in the United States. We proposed a Random Forest machine learning
based COVID19 vulnerability model using CDC sociodemographic and
COVID19-specific themes. An innovative COVID19 Impact Assessment algorithm was
also developed using homogeneity and trend assessment technique for evaluating
severity of the pandemic in all counties and train RF model. Developed C19VI
was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID19 Community
Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI along with census data, we
explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID19 health
outcomes amongst different regions in the United States. Our C19VI index
indicates that 18.30% of the counties falls into very high vulnerability class,
24.34% in high, 23.32% in moderate, 22.34% in low, and 11.68% in very low.
Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities and 82.84% of
economically poor communities are very high or high COVID19 vulnerable regions.
The proposed approach of vulnerability modeling takes advantage of both the
well-established field of statistical analysis and the fast-evolving domain of
machine learning. C19VI provides an accurate and more reliable way to measure
county level vulnerability in the United States. This index aims at helping
emergency planners to develop more effective mitigation strategies especially
for the disproportionately impacted communities.

especially in urban areas. During spring 2020, many countries enacted social
distancing measures in order to slow down the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. A
particularly drastic measure, the ""lockdown"", urged people to stay at home and
thereby prevent new Covid-19 infections. In turn, it also reduced traffic and
industrial activities. But how much did these lockdown measures improve air
quality in large cities, and are there differences in how air quality was
affected? Here, we analyse data from two megacities: London as an example for
Europe and Delhi as an example for Asia. We consider data during and before the
lockdown and compare these to a similar time period from 2019. Overall, we find
a reduction in almost all air pollutants with intriguing differences between
the two cities. In London, despite smaller average concentrations, we still
observe high-pollutant states and an increased tendency towards extreme events
(a higher kurtosis during lockdown). For Delhi, we observe a much stronger
decrease of pollution concentrations, including high pollution states. These
results could help to design rules to improve long-term air quality in
megacities.

  interventions based on epidemiological indicators","Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as banning public events or
instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when
an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold.
Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the
indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use?
In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this
question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and
compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators.
Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of
the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low
as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total
number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological
indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off
between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger
threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators
then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates
the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using
indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models
in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of
models.

  Ahead of COVID-19 Outbreak","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has crushed daily routines and is
still rampaging through the world. Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical
interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of
residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial
distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the
subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or
slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for
being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are
usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose
C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every
neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the
spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher
collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then
characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of
features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the
firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local
outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn
""city-invariant"" representations from the mobility-related features for precise
early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases
known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher
using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the
results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early
detection of high-risk neighborhoods from a large number of cities.

will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression.
Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an
essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive
clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the
severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the
lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this
end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity
assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe
segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few
infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we
first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image
patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance
deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of
COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet
consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe
segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a
unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context
information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the
performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a
real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results
suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object
classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is
computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the
centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index

measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality. As such, excess
mortality has received considerable interest during the first months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are
somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends,
correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, and the
autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased
estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be
misinterpreted as excess mortality. We present a blend of classical
epidemiological approaches to estimating excess mortality during extraordinary
events with an established demographic approach in mortality forecasting,
namely a Lee-Carter type model, which covers the named limitations and draws a
more realistic picture of the excess mortality. We illustrate our approach
using weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the
current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our proposed model provides a
general framework that can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor
excess mortality from specific causes of deaths.

COVID-19 outbreak on female and male academics' research productivity in social
science. The lockdown has caused substantial disruptions to academic
activities, requiring people to work from home. How this disruption affects
productivity and the related gender equity is an important operations and
societal question. We collect data from the largest open-access preprint
repository for social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines
produced by 76,832 authors across 25 countries over a span of two years. We use
a difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock.
Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United
States, although the total research productivity increased by 35%, female
academics' productivity dropped by 13.9% relative to that of male academics. We
also show that several disciplines drive such gender inequality. Finally, we
find that this intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for academics in
top-ranked universities, and the effect exists in six other countries. Our work
points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding
that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It
also helps organizations realize the potential unintended consequences that can
arise from telecommuting.

COVID-19 deaths together with confirmed cases one-week ahead of the current

notable feature of our spatio-temporal model is that it considers the (a)
temporal auto- and pairwise correlation of the two local time series (confirmed
cases and death of the COVID-19), (b) dynamics between locations (propagation
between counties), and (c) covariates such as local within-community mobility
and social demographic factors. The within-community mobility and demographic
factors, such as total population and the proportion of the elderly, are
included as important predictors since they are hypothesized to be important in
determining the dynamics of COVID-19. To reduce the model's
high-dimensionality, we impose sparsity structures as constraints and emphasize
the impact of the top ten metropolitan areas in the nation, which we refer (and
treat within our models) as hubs in spreading the disease. Our retrospective

infection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to
detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a
pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN)
with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be
presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and
made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images
from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray
images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10%
of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove
the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,
Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect
the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small
number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the
complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination
of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing
accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most
appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and

random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the
COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable
controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare
system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes
will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow
informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with
much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time
assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates.
  Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous
population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested
people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current
fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to
real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still
higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in
spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in
place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is
still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of
restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is
demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where
the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.

  to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Contained in Cough-Generated Fluid Particles","The ongoing respiratory COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the social and
private lives of the majority of the global population. This infection is
primarily transmitted via virus-laden fluid particles (i.e., droplets and
aerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of infected individuals and
expelled from the mouth in the course of breathing, talking, coughing, and
sneezing. To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the
world, the public has been asked or even obliged to use face covers. It is
plausible that in the years ahead we will see the use of face masks, face
shields and respirators become a normal practice in our life. However, wearing
face covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer
heat, while staying on beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in
gyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become contaminated with time and
need to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are caused by
the fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward
and outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen.
Applying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material
based protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air
across the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging
virus-laden particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a
consequence, displacing them away from their primary trajectories. The study,
shows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can effectively provide
both inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal
protective equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus
infection like COVID-19.

importance to detect the disease at an early stage especially in the hot spots

sofar. Due to its promptness and effective results computed tomography
(CT)-scan image is preferred to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain

quantifying their topological properties. We primarily use a tool called
persistent homology, from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), to compute these
topological properties. We train and test our model on the ""SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan

significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world
scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby
precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in
order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic.
Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed
at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or
attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes
are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this
approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of
the giant component $P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree
distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$ we recover prior work on
targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.
Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases
quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with
complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between
$|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha
n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2<\gamma<3$, we
find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from
$n=1$ to order of $\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks,
knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce
dramatically an epidemics.

progression of infectious diseases. We treat the problem by adopting a partial
differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered,
Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by
replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent
work (Computational Mechanics, 66, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of
global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as
epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the
SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant
parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in
semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a
scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied
to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan

  lethality across age and sex and predicts that of SARS, supporting possible
  therapy","The fatality rate of Covid-19 escalates with age and is larger in men than
women. I show that these variations correlate strongly with the level of the
viral receptor protein ACE2 in rat lungs, which is consistent with the still
limited and apparently contradictory data on human ACE2. Surprisingly, lower
levels of the receptor correlate with higher fatality. However, a previous
mathematical model predicts that the speed of viral progression in the organism
has a maximum and then declines with the receptor level. Moreover, many
manifestations of severe CoViD-19, such as severe lung injury, exacerbated
inflammatory response and thrombotic problems may derive from increased
Angiotensin II (Ang-II) level that results from degradation of ACE2 by the
virus. I present here a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on
viral propagation and disease severity. The model fits Covid-19 fatality rate
across age and sex with high accuracy ($r^2>0.9$) under the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 infections are in the dynamical regimes in which increased receptor
slows down viral propagation. Moreover, rescaling the model parameters by the
ratio of the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and sex, thus
linking the molecular and epidemiological levels. The presented model opposes
the fear that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), suggested as a therapy
against the most adverse effects of CoViD-19, may favour viral propagation, and
suggests that Ang-II and ACE2 are candidate prognostic factors for detecting
population that needs stronger protection.

  and CLAHE for detection of COVID-19","Background and Objective:Currently, the whole world is facing a pandemic
disease, novel Coronavirus also known as COVID-19, which spread in more than
200 countries with around 3.3 million active cases and 4.4 lakh deaths
approximately. Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited supply of
testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary for
containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing the
death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed
a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated
with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest
X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named
COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional
neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used
as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and
DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with
lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without
quantization. Results:The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved
performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed
method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas
96.43% for multiclass classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art
methods. Conclusion:Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional results
on various performance metrics. With detailed model interpretations, COVIDLite
can assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 patients from CXR images and can
reduce the diagnosis time significantly.

submit their forecasts weekly to the CDC. It is not possible to declare whether
one method is better than the other using those forecasts because each team's
submission may correspond to different techniques over the period and involve
human interventions as the teams are continuously changing/tuning their
approach. Such forecasts may be considered ""human-expert"" forecasts and do not
qualify as AI/ML approaches, although they can be used as an indicator of human
expert performance. We are interested in supporting AI/ML research in epidemic
forecasting which can lead to scalable forecasting without human intervention.
Which modeling technique, learning strategy, and data pre-processing technique
work well for epidemic forecasting is still an open problem. To help advance

  France","Large scale virological testing of SARS-Cov2 is implemented since May 2020 in
France. We assume that the positivity of asymptomatic people not being contact
cases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French
population, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using
Sant\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August
was about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning
of September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously
infected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce
that intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate
(IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036%
and 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on
the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France,
Ile de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations
are using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45
(1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which
occurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated
incidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks
induces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An
incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total
number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000
respectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed
close to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual
immunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of
October 2020. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously
thought, but its severity became limited since the end of the first wave.

  and Tuberculosis Detection Using X-Ray Images in Resource Limited Settings","Clinicians in the frontline need to assess quickly whether a patient with
symptoms indeed has COVID-19 or not. The difficulty of this task is exacerbated

Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low-

tiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of
COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray

classification using machine learning methods that do not require large
computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images
including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,
TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14
individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with
traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50
for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the
best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection
accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the
same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler
three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing
COVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively.
The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to
extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier
with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine. The results suggest the potential
benefits of using our pipeline in the detection of COVID-19, particularly in
resource-limited settings and it can run with limited computational resources.

world and has a significant impact on public healthcare. Due to rising
skepticism towards the sensitivity of RT-PCR as screening method, medical
imaging like computed tomography offers great potential as alternative. For
this reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical
decision support for quantitative assessment and disease monitoring. However,
publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited which leads to overfitting
of traditional approaches. To address this problem, we propose an innovative
automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to
handle small datasets by utilization as variant databases. Our method focuses
on on-the-fly generation of unique and random image patches for training by
performing several preprocessing methods and exploiting extensive data
augmentation. For further reduction of the overfitting risk, we implemented a
standard 3D U-Net architecture instead of new or computational complex neural
network architectures. Through a 5-fold cross-validation on 20 CT scans of
COVID-19 patients, we were able to develop a highly accurate as well as robust
segmentation model for lungs and COVID-19 infected regions without overfitting
on the limited data. Our method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.956

outperforms related approaches, advances the state-of-the-art for COVID-19

  of strategies for COVID-19 ""second phase"" in public buildings","Restarting public buildings activities in the ""second phase"" of COVID-19
emergency should be supported by operational measures to avoid a second virus
spreading. Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and
significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with
infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial
masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards ""social distancing"") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built
environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate
occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and
exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations.
Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies
and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data
(""Diamond Princess"" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part
of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable
infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such
measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by
occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to
combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The
model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public
buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).

  airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol","The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly
spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from
person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding
to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by
cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the
majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper
respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral
airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction
of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways.
While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as
well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid
how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells.
The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of
SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this
purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size
distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing
normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct
infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a
bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the
extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we
concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2
infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the
enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less
dangerous...

  COVID-19 Projects","The ability to determine what parts of objects and surfaces people touch as
they go about their daily lives would be useful in understanding how the
COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person has touched an object or
surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer
vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the
2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this
solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to
projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to
infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require
significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint
variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a
person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to
this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact
between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the
object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing
their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected
points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency.
Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep
networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface
space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography
transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life
applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy
detection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in
a meeting room using the contact information.

  Twitter","Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against
a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are
besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related
terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and
diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of
war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also
in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present
an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets
posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first
analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show
that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus
treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the
population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to
three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal
frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal
frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR
is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.
However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around
many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line
with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,
may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the
Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in

  Encryption and Huffman Codes","Location data are widely used in mobile apps, ranging from location-based
recommendations, to social media and navigation. A specific type of interaction
is that of location-based alerts, where mobile users subscribe to a service
provider (SP) in order to be notified when a certain event occurs nearby.
Consider, for instance, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where contact tracing
has been singled out as an effective means to control the virus spread. Users
wish to be notified if they came in proximity to an infected individual.
However, serious privacy concerns arise if the users share their location
history with the SP in plaintext. To address privacy, recent work proposed
several protocols that can securely implement location-based alerts. The users
upload their encrypted locations to the SP, and the evaluation of location
predicates is done directly on ciphertexts. When a certain individual is
reported as infected, all matching ciphertexts are found (e.g., according to a
predicate such as ""10 feet proximity to any of the locations visited by the
infected patient in the last week""), and the corresponding users notified.
However, there are significant performance issues associated with existing
protocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform
the matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of
locations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this
paper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on
Huffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted
locations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to
significantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
gain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments
that the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is
substantial.

15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great
ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies,
and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive
genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host
immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of
recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the
elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the
viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa
react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of
Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at
increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of
getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities.
Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same

probabilistic rise in the number of confirmed cases due to the concomitant

demonstrates that increasing the testing for symptomatic patients does not have
any major effect on the progression of the pandemic, but testing rate of the
asymptomatic population has an extremely crucial role to play. The model is
executed using the data obtained for the state of Chhattisgarh in the Republic
of India. The model is shown to have significantly better predictive capability
than the other epidemiological models. This model can be readily applied to any

for any other epidemic as well.

  with framework for evaluating health intervention cost","Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 have primarily
involved lockdown measures with substantial economic and social costs with
varying degrees of success. Morbidity patterns of COVID-19 variants have a
strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have
association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced
economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others.
Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe COVID-19 community spread
incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through a flexible
parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed
Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising
different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently.
Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact
matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally
adapted. This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing
counterfactual scenarios, which could assist policy makers with regard to
minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective suppression
strategies. Our work originates from an Irish context and we use disease
monitoring data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish
governmental agencies. We demonstrate how Irish lockdown scenarios can be
constructed using the proposed model formulation and show results of
retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with relevant
``what if/instead of'' lockdown counterfactuals with uncertainty
quantification. Our formulation is agnostic to a specific locale, in that
lockdown strategies in other regions can be straightforwardly encoded using
this model. The methods we describe are made publicly available online through
an accessible and easy to use web interface.

  Stress from COVID-19","When facing an extreme stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare
systems typically respond reactively by creating surge capacity at facilities
that are at or approaching their baseline capacity. However, creating
individual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach,
and redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce
the total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly
distributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to
create surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is
this inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at
over-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal
demand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and
resource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze
a series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of
the demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand
uncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also
incorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers
may need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated
retrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and
Miami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative
to the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are
operationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In
summary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a
practical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly
care for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.

an enormous human tragedy with dramatic economic impacts. This paper describes
the response and expected recovery process for Western Australia, where a rapid
and effective response was implemented. This has enabled an early transition
into an expected recovery both in health and economic terms. The positive
lessons learned from this experience are documented as they emerge in order to
support other states and nations as they address this issue globally in the
near-term and consider enduring improvements for the longer term. While the
authors have personal experience in the WA context, wider observations across
Australia and selected international benchmarks are also included. Key lessons
include the importance of good health advice in Australia's interest; timely,
synchronized and aligned action at all levels of government; a program of well
communicated, aligned health and economic measures which support all in society
allowing a very high level of appropriate community behaviour, ensuring the
health system was not overloaded; innovation in telehealth, testing, pandemic
modelling, and integrated operations which also allowed essential industries to
continue; and strong border and travel controls with highly effective isolation
preventing community spread, ultimately enabling rapid elimination of the
disease from the hospital system. In combination, these demonstrate that in the
case of Western Australia the result of first eliminating the disease from the
community, and then reopening the economy progressively at a strong pace, has
enabled a world leading outcome in both in health and economic terms. The
lessons from this experience are widely applicable, shareable both as
supporting service to other regions and through knowledge transfer.

as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced
mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users
with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random
tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'
phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to
learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been
diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end
privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these
approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token
metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users.
  In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing
with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their
contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of
users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides
protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new
cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality
(PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the
intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We
specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients
have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.

  boom in medical research and ultimately digital twins?","After being collected for patient care, Observational Health Data (OHD) can
further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health
informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the
fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a
groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial
sectors, and medical imaging.
  The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying
disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to
common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases,
and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the
healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data
related for the reasons stated above.
  Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to
be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly
reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the
properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms
(unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly
transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.
  We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in
2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and
we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data
modelling, and reproducibility.

  Evidence from Pooled Literature Analysis and Insights from Integrated

differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify
potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a
systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted

decisions about mitigation strategies and to understand the disease dynamics,
policy makers and epidemiologists must know how the disease is spreading in
their communities. We analyze confirmed infections and deaths over multiple
geographic scales to show that COVID-19's impact is highly unequal: many
subregions have nearly zero infections, and others are hot spots. We attribute
the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at
different times and grows exponentially. Hot spots, however, appear to grow
faster than neighboring subregions and dominate spatially aggregated
statistics, thereby amplifying growth rates. The staggered spread of COVID-19
can also make aggregated growth rates appear higher even when subregions grow
at the same rate. Public policy, economic analysis and epidemic modeling need
to account for potential distortions introduced by spatial aggregation.

consequence of the fear and anxiety workers feel because of COVID-19, they
become distracted and spend less time working. We show that in the long run,

sufficiently small only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of the

such as roads. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that
major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple
model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a
quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with
diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected
individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between
individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A
classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system
analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement
of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence
of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when
the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to $1$. More subtle qualitative
features of the final state, showing the important influence of the line, are
also proved here.

  COVID-19 and mitigation measures","Epidemiology models with constant parameters may not capture the infection
patterns in the presence of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation
measures during a pandemic, since infectiousness is a function of time. In this
paper, Epidemiology Informed Neural Network (EINN) algorithms are introduced to
discover time-varying infection rates for the COVID-19 pandemic. Since there
are asymptomatic infectives, mostly unreported, EINN learns the probability
that an infective individual is asymptomatic. Using cumulative and daily
reported cases of infectives, we simulate the impact of non-pharmaceutical
mitigation measures such as early detection of infectives, contact tracing, and
social distancing on the basic reproduction number. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of vaccination, a pharmaceutical mitigation measure, together
with non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures on the daily reported infectives.
The EINN algorithms discover time-varying infection and recovery rates. The

compartmental model. This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals'
decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an
individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting
infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers
his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be
high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed,
resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove
theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this
equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal
optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning
that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples
and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental
model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease.
In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and
societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to

effective solution in healthcare for bi-directional protection against
air-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential for
its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution
for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and
positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such algorithms
can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and

scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The
inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing
sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably
low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain
on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address
these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for
correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is
implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.
Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling
multi-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.
When deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is
reduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an
accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.
To maintain equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures,
skin-tones, hair types, and mask types, the algorithms are tested for their

  Problems","The non-population conserving SIR (SIR-NC) model to describe the spread of
infections in a community is proposed and studied. Unlike the standard SIR
model, SIR-NC does not assume population conservation. Although similar in form
to the standard SIR, SIR-NC admits a closed form solution while allowing us to
model mortality, and also provides different, and arguably a more realistic,
interpretation of the model parameters. Numerical comparisons of this SIR-NC
model with the standard, population conserving, SIR model are provided.
Extensions to include imported infections, interacting communities, and models
that include births and deaths are presented and analyzed. Several numerical
examples are also presented to illustrate these models. Two control problems
for the SIR-NC epidemic model are presented. First we consider the continuous
time model predictive control in which the cost function variables correspond
to the levels of lockdown, the level of testing and quarantine, and the number
of infections. We also include a switching cost for moving between lockdown
levels. A discrete time version that is more amenable to computation is then
presented along with numerical illustrations. We then consider a
multi-objective and multi-community control where we can define multiple cost
functions on the different communities and obtain the minimum cost control to
keep the value function corresponding to these control objectives below a
prescribed threshold.

algorithm, robust to various density enhancing lung abnormalities, to
facilitate rapid quantitative analysis of computed tomography images. A
polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled
left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of
animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural
network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung
regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation.
Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively
evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer,
and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar
segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input
to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using
hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The
proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using
semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images,
achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and
Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four
radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated
and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently
more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe
cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach
was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation
without requiring COVID-19 cases for training.

hundred thousand deaths by April 20201. Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA)
is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the
transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among
different regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA
and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling
out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control
policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the
limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by
18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and
wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a
non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed
countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather
effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors
most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced
reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to
restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe
respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China,
Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due

infections. Face masks have become increasingly accepted as one of the most
effective means for combating the spread of the disease, when used in
combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However, there is
an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with
clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One
of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to
regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of
these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation
efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these
alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the
performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of
aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields
block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move
around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending
on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an
exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the
exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a
means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the
community spread of COVID-19, it may be preferable to use high quality cloth or

not used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters) distance between themselves
and their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of detecting
distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the
deadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest
(ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence
chance.
  On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow
the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and
warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system
should never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the
individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop,
and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against
this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based
real-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is
detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without
targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if
the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal
to modulate inflow into the ROI. We tested the proposed method across
real-world datasets to measure its generality and performance. The proposed
method is ready for deployment, and our code is open-sourced.

  World","While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life
in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much
public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus
pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among
solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or
slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social
distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of
social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing
down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be
minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every
individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can
minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be
found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large
class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social
sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes
many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and
can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or
allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible
distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and
analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different
contact values are assigned to different network sites.

pandemic. Evaluating the effects of these policies, both on the number of
Covid-19 cases as well on other economic outcomes is a key ingredient for
policymakers to be able to determine which policies are most effective as well
as the relative costs and benefits of particular policies. In this paper, we
consider the relative merits of common identification strategies exploiting
variation in policy choices made across different locations by checking whether
the identification strategies are compatible with leading epidemic models in
the epidemiology literature. We argue that unconfoundedness type approaches are
likely to be more useful for evaluating policies than difference in differences
type approaches due to the highly nonlinear spread of cases during a pandemic.
For difference in differences, we further show that a version of this problem
continues to exist even when one is interested in understanding the effect of a
policy on other economic outcomes when those outcomes also depend on the number
of Covid-19 cases. We propose alternative approaches that are able to
circumvent these issues. We apply our proposed approach to study the effect of

  conditions","Containment measures implemented by some countries to suppress the spread of
COVID-19 have resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic characterized by time
series of daily infections plateauing over extended periods of time. We prove
that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the
critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single
infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic,
however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a
number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such
non-trivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model.
We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model.
We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the
initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the
outbreak is a non-monotonic function of the initial number of infected
individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations
associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics
with non-trivial initial conditions. Far from heard immunity, fluctuations are
much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing
time series may be particularly challenging.

coronavirus patients from non-patients. Materials and Methods: Multiple
international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were

models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with
clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to
analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19
thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient
over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study

enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and

For example, the COVID-19 emergency has made it clear that scholarly articles,

are often not generated correctly for archived web resources, including pages

smoothing. We validate the performance of DAR$_t$ through simulations and

development, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma
therapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight
COVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like
India, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd
immunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19
infection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and
will result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions
(complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing,
etc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spread
until the vaccine development. In this work, we have suggested the SIR model

expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main
factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major
reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To
contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT
(Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to
spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the
authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if
they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all
persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients.
Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control
over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.

estimates the daily change of $R$ and the detection rate simultaneously using a
Bayesian model. The analysis using synthesized data shows that our model
correctly estimates $R$ and detects a short-term shock of the detection rate.
Then, we apply our model to data from several countries to evaluate the
effectiveness of public healthcare measures. Our analysis focuses Japan, which
employs a moderate measure to keep ""social distance"". The result indicates a
downward trend and now $R$ becomes below $1$. Although our analysis is

agents respond dynamically to each other in light of a fixed utility function.
However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary

highlighted the need to formulate and analyze such models which feature
game-environment feedback. For instance, a highly prevalent virus may
incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing
reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for
mask-wearing. What is the interplay between epidemic severity and the behaviors
of a victim population? For initial answers, we develop a general framework
using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the
stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which

  Pathways in Hospitals","Pathogen outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks of bacteria and viruses) in hospitals can
cause high mortality rates and increase costs for hospitals significantly. An
outbreak is generally noticed when the number of infected patients rises above
an endemic level or the usual prevalence of a pathogen in a defined population.
Reconstructing transmission pathways back to the source of an outbreak -- the
patient zero or index patient -- requires the analysis of microbiological data
and patient contacts. This is often manually completed by infection control
experts. We present a novel visual analytics approach to support the analysis
of transmission pathways, patient contacts, the progression of the outbreak,
and patient timelines during hospitalization. Infection control experts applied
our solution to a real outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a large German
hospital. Using our system, our experts were able to scale the analysis of
transmission pathways to longer time intervals (i.e., several years of data
instead of days) and across a larger number of wards. Also, the system is able
to reduce the analysis time from days to hours. In our final study, feedback
from twenty-five experts from seven German hospitals provides evidence that our
solution brings significant benefits for analyzing outbreaks. It is also
applicable to COVID-19 hospital-associated transmissions.

series of cavities is proposed to ensure efficient actual disinfection. The

necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough
understanding of sampling confidence and bias is necessary in order make

a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo
sampling to assess metric confidence. This model can provide realistic
simulated data which can be used in the design and calibration of data analysis

in the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day,
and an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$
unbiased samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to
assess more advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy
for finding peaks in the dynamics.

suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A
time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during

active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the
virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable
parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of
about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for
recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about
1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate
measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about

seems manageable by the country national health service with an estimated 1,140

alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the
presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and
specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its
use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by
radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based
on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray.
Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A
(1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763
non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19),
respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or

show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model,

increased slightly by +0.9% in December 2020 compared with 2019, indicating the
trends of rebound of global emissions. Later waves of COVID-19 infections in
late 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused further CO$_2$ emissions
reductions particularly in western countries, but to a much smaller extent than
the declines in the first wave. That even substantial world-wide lockdowns of
activity led to a one-time decline in global CO$_2$ emissions of only 5.4% in
one year highlights the significant challenges for climate change mitigation
that we face in the post-COVID era. These declines are significant, but will be
quickly overtaken with new emissions unless the COVID-19 crisis is utilized as
a break-point with our fossil-fuel trajectory, notably through policies that
make the COVID-19 recovery an opportunity to green national energy and
development plans.

  Classification from CT Images","  An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded
in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic
around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also
be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in
Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness
may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and
progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden
standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.
Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources
may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such
circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis
and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly
supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of
manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection
detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the
promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a
wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.
