Abstract
Understanding the molecular mechanism of COVID19 disease pathogenesis
helps in the rapid development of therapeutic targets. Usually, viral protein
targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The pathogen may target cell
signaling pathways to disrupt the pathway genes’ regular activities, resulting in disease. Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host
proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by
discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions.
The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage
biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral
proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes
during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity
(and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the hostviral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential
signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting
mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We in∗

fer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can
find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral
protein.
Extensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically
and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral
proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively
correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural
protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways
observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease. A good number
of targeted proteins are highly central in host protein interaction networks.
Proteins participating in multiple pathways are also highly connected in their
own PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins.

1. Introduction
The entire world is passing through an unprecedented pandemic situation
due to a massive outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona
Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infected viral disease, COVID-19. SARS-CoV2, is a
large enveloped coronavirus (family -Coronaviridae, subfamily- Coronavirinae) with non-segmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA genomes
[1], transmits rapidly through human to human contacts. The need for the
hour and utmost crucial for the scientific community to understand the disease pathogenesis of SAR-CoV2 in genomics and proteomics level for the
rapid development of effective drugs or vaccines to control the COVID-19.
Many recent works use HVPPI as an input to elucidate potential drug targets or repurposed drug molecules [2, 3? , 4]. Host-pathogen protein interactions provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenecity [5].
The host defense mechanism activates signal transduction molecules that
initiate signals that activate immune effector mechanisms to protect the host
from any pathogenic infections. Studies show that viral immune modulators
perturb the human PPI network by targeting signaling pathways [6] to suppress the immunity in mammalian hosts [7]. To understand the molecular
mechanism of pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 during COVID19 disease, inves2

tigate the host-viral protein interactions is important. Knowledge gained
through the understanding of the viral proteins interact with the host proteins involved in signaling pathways may translate into effective therapies
and vaccines. We aim to study the attacking pattern of SARS-CoV2 towards its host proteins involved in signaling pathways. We focus on regulatory signaling pathways, mainly involved in signaling transduction and
cellular interactions. Signal transduction focuses on molecular and functional aspects of viral interactions with host cell signaling with relevance
for the anti-viral response, the viral life cycle, viral pathogenesis, and cell
transformation [8]. Collectively, we consider total seventeen (17) major signaling pathways namely TGF-beta, Jak-STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, HIF-1,
TNF, NF-kappa B , Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Apoptosis, Th17
cell differentiation, Chemokine, Toll-like receptor, RIG-like receptor, IL-17,
Insulin Signaling, mTOR, and Adipocytokine signaling pathways [9, 10, 11].
Using a high throughput experimental techniques, like yeast two-hybrid
(Y2H) screening and tandem-affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry revealed miniatures the interactomes of a few model organisms so
far. Finding physical interactions is always not feasible due to the expensive
experimental setup. Most importantly, it is time-consuming. Experimental
methods are prone to incompleteness and noise. Because of the need for rapid
development of drugs or vaccines in current pandemic scenarios, the best alternative is to guess the possible physical interactions computationally based
on available data sources. Considering different properties of proteins such as
sequence homology, gene co-expression, and phylogenetic profiles [12, 13, 14],
pairwise similarity is computed between a pair of proteins to predict a possible interaction between them. In addition to non-structural information,
structural data about a pair of proteins appears to be more effective in improving prediction accuracy [15, 16, 3]. A number of in-silico approaches
recently attempted [2, 17] to reconstruct CoV2-Host PPI. Computational
methods for predicting interactions among protein molecules, in-silico depend largely on the merit of the data in hand and similarity measures [18]
used. In reality, predicting deterministically whether two given proteins are
physically interacting or not based on the similarity of different structural
and non-structural features, is a challenging task due to the above crucial
factors.
Few studies report the great significance of codon usage biases [19, 20] in
establishing host-viral protein interactions [21]. Viral gene depends largely
on the host translational machinery for their expression. Consequently, vi3

ral proteins are co-evolved with host proteins and adopt mechanisms to exploit host codon usage biases. Interestingly, highly expressed viral proteins
are typically showing similar codon usage biases [22, 23] to target host proteins [24]. On the other hand, to minimize the host immune system responses,
certain viral proteins adopt a mechanism to reduce viral protein expression.
Few works hypothesized [25, 26] that viral proteins enrich in codons that are
rare in their host genomes, and this rare codon usage helps in controlling the
expression level.
In this work, we try to infer a host-viral protein interaction network
leveraging the inherent correlation between codon usage biases between viral
and host proteins. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work exploiting
the codon usage pattern to infer host-viral PPI. We try to capture both
positive and negative interactions in the host-viral PPI. We use host proteins
involved in different human cellular signaling pathways by looking into their
significance in disease pathogenesis. Topologically and biologically, we try
to establish the relevance of the host proteins and highlight a few essential
proteins in the network, which may be useful drug targets for certain reported
drugs.

In this section, we discuss our proposed scheme for constructing a hostviral PPI network using codon usage patterns of host and viral proteins.
To analyze the interaction mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins in host
signaling pathways, we select a set of all the genes involved in few candidate
signaling pathways.
2.1. Data acquisition and processing
Structurally, SARS-CoV2 consists of three categories of proteins, Structural, Nonstructural, and Accessory proteins. We select four (04) structural proteins, sixteen (16) non-structural proteins, and six (06) as reported
in Wuhan, China [27]. The details of the viral proteins are listed in Table 1 (NCBI accession numbers for SERS-CoV2 proteins: MN908947.3, NC 045512 ).
To collect significant host genes involved in our candidate 17 signaling
pathways, we search Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)

2.2. Computing Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU)
The genetic code describes how the 64-nucleotide triplets specify only
twenty (20) different translated amino acids. These alternative codons for
the same amino acids are termed as synonymous codons. However, most of
the amino acids have at least two synonymous codons that are not used at the
same frequencies in different genomes. According to the genome hypothesis
proposed by Grantham et al. [29], the pattern of codon usage is speciesspecific and some way unique. Interestingly, even in the same genome, the
codon usage varies significantly among genes with different expression levels [23], functions [30], and tissue-specific patterns [31]. Codon usage vari1

ation occurs may be due to natural selection and/or mutation pressure for
accurate and efficient translation in various organisms [19, 20]. Differences in
the frequency of occurrence on synonymous codons in coding DNA is termed
as synonymous codon usage bias [32].
RSCU is one the indices for measuring codon bias independent of the
amino acid composition and widely used to estimate the codon usage bias
[33, 34, 35]. It may use to quantify the similarity between any two gene
sequences by applying any classical proximity measure between a pair of
RSCU vectors. The similarity between RSCU vectors may reflect the possible
interactions between a couple of proteins in the PPI [35, 36, 34].
RSCU is the ratio between the observed number of occurrences of codons
and expected during uniform usage of synonymous codons and can be calculated as follows.
Xi,j
,
(1)
RSCUi,j = 1 Pni
j=1 Xi,j
ni
where, Xi,j is the number of occurrences of the j th codon for the ith amino
acid, which is encoded by ni synonymous codons. The RSCU score of a codon
more than 1.0 indicates excess usage (biased) of the codon, and less than 1.0
marks poor usage of that particular codon.
We report codon usage distribution of 59 codons across 26 SARS-CoV2
proteins in Figure 1 (a) and 1313 host proteins (Figure 1 (b)) involved in our
candidate signaling pathways. We observe that GGT, AGA, GCT, CCT,
GTT, TCT, ACA, CTT, TTA, ACT are the highly used (median RSCU
score ≥ 1.5 for each codon) codons in SAR-CoV2 proteins. On the other
hand, CGA, AGC, ACC, CGG, CTG, CCG, ACG, GCG, TCG, GGG rarely
used codons. In the case of host proteins (from 17 signaling pathways),
codons such as CTG, GTG, ATC, GCC, CAG, ACC, AGC, GGC, CCC are
highly used (median RSCU score ≥ 1.5 for each codon). The distribution
margins of RSCU values of those codons are relatively wider (Figure 1 (b)).
However, CCG, GTT, CGT, GCG, TCG, CAA, CTA, ATA, GTA, TTA
rarely used codons in host proteins. It is worth mentioning that for SARSCoV2 proteins, highly used codons are ending with T or A and host proteins,
ending with G or C at the third position of the codons.
We generate a 59-dimensional RSCU feature vector for each coding protein. We consider the usage pattern of only 59 codons (out of 64 available
codons). We ignore 03 stop codons and uniquely coded codons ATG and
TGG coded for Met and Trp amino acids, respectively [37]. For RSCU cal6

vectors, we try to draw the similarity between host and viral proteins to
form a network, as discussed next.
2.3. Inferring Host-Viral Protein Interaction Network
Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) are usually studied computationally
from a graph-theoretic perspective [18]. Interactions among different organisms, such as a host and its pathogen, are primarily driven by interactions
among the host proteins and pathogen proteins. These interactions can also
be represented as host-pathogen PPI. Host-pathogen PPI usually represented
as a bipartite graph where any given interacting pair of nodes (proteins) does
not belong to the same organism. This network essentially provides the
known interactions of host proteins with pathogen proteins. On the other
hand, the interactions may be guessed (or inferred) computationally based
on different attributes of the target protein pairs when physical interactions
are missing. The host-pathogen interaction network essentially represents a
snapshot of the infection mechanism in a host cell infected by pathogens.
The virus-host interactome is essential for understanding virulence factors
influencing SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis [39]. Recent studies reported the use
of SARS-CoV2 and host PPI networks to study the pathogenesis of SARSCoV2 and identifying repurposed drugs [17? , 3, 40].
We infer interaction between two proteins using codon usage similarity.
Two proteins are considered to be strongly coupled if there RSCU similarity
bearing particular statistical significance.
Given Rv = {x1 , x2 , · · · , xm=59 } and Rh = {y1 , x2 , · · · , ym=59 }, RSCU
vectors of a pair of host and viral proteins respectively, proteins are strongly
connected if p score is less than certain threshold τ i.e. p(Rv , Rh ) < τ .
We use SciPy version 1.5.0 (sipy.stats) 3 for calculating Pearson correlation coefficient, which uses 2-tailed p-value for measuring significant relationships [41].
The presence of interaction between a viral protein V pi and a host protein Hpi is dependent on a significant threshold () obtained from the given
RSCU-feature vectors of the host protein and the viral protein. For strong
relationship we set p < 0.001 and τ < p).
Inferring the network, we consider two (02) kinds of interaction, positive
and negative, between a host and viral protein. Positive interaction indicates

We predict the host-viral interaction graph based on the Equation 3 involving 26 viral proteins with 1326 host proteins participating in 17 different
signaling pathways. Out of 34138 (26×1313) maximum possible interactions,
our method infers 9412 (≈ 36%) strong interactions where 859 distinct host
proteins (≈ 66%) are connected to at least one viral protein. We fix τ = 0.001
as significant p-value for inferring strong edge between two proteins. Interestingly, our inferred network reveals that out of 859 host proteins, a total
of 779 proteins is targeted by more than one viral protein. A snapshot of
isolated networks with one (viral) to many (host) interactions is shown in
Figure 3 between viral and host proteins.

3.1. Distribution of correlation scores
While inferring an edge we consider only the significant p score (p = .001)
and use the sign derived from correlation (ρ) as a type of the interaction. Statistically, it is also important to study the distribution of correlation values
(both positive and negative) between pairs of proteins in terms of codon
usage patterns. From the distribution plot given in Figure 4 reveals that
codon usage pattern between a pair of host and viral proteins (edge correlation) are non randomly associated and showing a Gaussian [43, 44] like
distributions (with p = 1.13e − 42 for positive and p = 7.819e − 94 for
negative correlation distributions based on normality test performed using
SciPy.stats.normaltest 5 ). The negative correlation is varied in the range
[-.73, -4.18] which covered 6325 (67%) interactions, and a positive correlation is varied within [4.18, 8.44] including 3087 (33%) interactions. Positive
correlation exhibits a more wider range of values than the negative range.
We further look into the correlation value distribution of a viral protein
interacting with its target proteins. We report the correlation value range
(both positive and negative) for 26 viral proteins in Figure 4. We observe
that while fixing the p score at a high significance level, correlation values
also appear to be significant, and it is ranging from ±0.05 and above. The
majority of the viral proteins are correlated both positively and negatively
with its targets except for a few in the inferred network. Orf10 and Nsp10
are viral proteins that are interacting with their target negatively. Similarly,
viral proteins like N, Nsp1 and Orf7b are interacting positively only.
Based on our correlation analysis, we may confirm that while a viral

protein targets its a host, it mimics similar codon usage as its target to
uphold the expression of target host proteins. Similarly, viral proteins use
a set of codons that are rarely used in their targets to down-regulate the
expression of its target. We observe that in the case of host proteins involved
in signaling pathways, the majority of SARS-CoV2 proteins aimed to break
down the normal pathways by downregulating the key proteins involved in
such pathways.
3.2. Degree distribution of host and viral proteins
In any interacting network, the node’s degree conveys essential information about the influence of the node within the network. In the case of hostviral PPI, a high degree of viral protein may be a key protein that interacts
with a high number of host proteins. Pharmacologically, the identification
of such proteins may help design a small molecule that may bind with it to
inhibit its influence during disease pathogenesis. The same may be applicable to host proteins. If host proteins have a high degree, it indicates that
the host proteins are targeted by more number of viral proteins. However,
it may require further investigation about its importance in its own network
i.e., host-host protein networks. If a host protein found to be significant
concerning its degree, suitable repurposed drug molecules may be identified
for the same.
While focusing on highly interacting viral proteins, interestingly, we observe that the maximum number of highly interacting proteins belongs to
the non-structural family. In the case of structural proteins, S is highly interacting (more than 600) protein. Out of accessory proteins, Orf8 shows
maximum interaction count close to protein S.
We report the degree distribution for each of the viral proteins from our
network in Figure 5 (a). From the figure, we may observe that majority
of the viral proteins carrying a high node degree. Out of all the SARSCoV2 proteins, Nsp3 shows the maximum degree (≈ 700), which interacts
with more than 80% of the candidate host proteins involved in 17 different
signaling pathways. Concerning negative edges, i.e., connected, negatively,
Nsp3 is still on top, followed by Nsp16, Nsp13, and so on. While considering
positive edges S, Nsp6 and Orf7a are found to be highly interactive. Few
viral proteins like Nsp11, Orf7b, E, Nsp1, Orf10, and Nsp11 found to be less
interactive, comparatively.
We show the distribution of the degree of 859 host proteins in Figure 5 (b),
interacting with 26 viral proteins. From the distribution plot, we can observe

that majority (82) of the host proteins are connected with only one viral node.
While considering highly targeted proteins by multiple viral proteins, we see
fewer than 10 proteins with degree 21 (maximum degree), which is lowest
within the distribution. Even though our network is a bipartite graph, we
observe that the number of low-degree nodes is high and high degree nodes
are lowest in the graph. It further indicates that hub or central nodes are
relatively less, which is somehow following the scale-free properties [45] of a
complex network. However, with an exception to the power-law distribution
curve, we observe relatively good host nodes possessing a degree within the
range 11 to 18.
3.3. Ranking highly targeted signaling pathways and its impact on COVID19
To study the most effected pathways in our 17 candidate set of pathways,
we rank them based on the percentage of host protein targeted by any viral proteins out of total proteins involved in those pathways and report in
Figure 6.

(MAPK) signaling pathways is viral proteins target profoundly affected pathways with more than 50% proteins from that pathway. MAPK proteins communicate signals from a receptor on the cell’s surface to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell, which is essential in a viral infection point of view. Besides,
MAPK proteins are involved in a series of vital signal transduction pathways
that regulate processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell
death in humans.
Beside MAPK, other ranked signaling pathways are significantly affected
during COVID19 infection. Under physiological conditions, adipokines act
mainly in adipose tissue (paracrine or autocrine) or circulate through the
blood circulation to distant target organs, regulating their growth and development, metabolism and tissue remodeling. However, under pathological
conditions, the synthesis and secretion of adipokines are disordered, leading
to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other metabolic disorders. Our results
show that the adipocytokine pathway is affected during COVID19. It implicates the patients with comorbid conditions like diabetes and heart disease
show worst disease aggression, which already observed in various reportings.
The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of mammalian metabolism and
physiology, with essential roles in the function of tissues, including liver, muscle, white and brown adipose tissue, and the brain. It dysregulated in human
diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, depression, aging-related problems, and
certain cancers. Our result corroborates with the same, and it’s reported
that aged patients are more prone to the infection due to the dysregulation
of m-TOR pathway or some other unknown reasons.
It also comes to notice that some COVID19 affected deaths are due to
multiple organ failure. HIF1 and RIG1 like receptor pathways, are involved in
normal immunoregulation and various organ functioning. Dysregulation may
cause immune compromisation and multiple organ failure through ischaemic
heart disease, acute lung injury, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute liver failure, liver
fibrosis and acute kidney injury etc. Our result also supports these findings.
In our ranking, the fourth most affected pathway is the TGF-β ( Transforming growth factor-beta), which is a multi-functional cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor superfamily that includes three different mammalian isoforms (TGF-β 1 to 3, HGNC symbols TGFB1, TGFB2,
TGFB3) and many other signaling proteins. TGFB proteins are produced
by all-white blood cell lineages. This pathway activates different downstream
substrates and regulatory proteins, inducing transcription of various target

genes that function in differentiation, chemotaxis, proliferation, and activation of many immune cells.
3.4. Centrality analysis of host proteins
Studies on human host-viral protein interactions reveal that virus tending
to targeted attacks towards host proteins [46, 47, 48] by interacting with
important (central) host proteins. We consider a host protein important if
it interacts with many other host proteins in host-host protein networks.
We use BioGRID [49] to calculate the centrality score of our candidate host
proteins 6 . We report top 100 central proteins in the Supplementary C. We
observe that a good number of interacting host proteins in our network are
highly central in the host PPI. We observe that a common set of viral proteins
targets central genes, and such proteins are involved in multiple pathways.
For instance, if we consider few top central proteins, MYC (2843), TRIM25
(2656), EGFR (2452), BRCA1 (2236), MDM2 (2219), NTRK1 (2030), KRAS
(1944), ELAVL1 (1914) and HSP90AA1 (1734), they are found to be targeted
commonly by the viral proteins such Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp4, Nsp5, Nsp8, Nsp10,
Nsp12, Nsp13.
If we consider the participation of most central proteins in our candidate
pathways, we observe that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (36) followed by the
MAPK signaling pathway (35) contains most of the central proteins. From
the disease pathogenesis perspective, a pathway may be more crucial if it
contains highly central proteins targeted by viral proteins. Moving one step
ahead, we may rank our 17 pathways based on the number of participating central proteins (top 100) in the above pathways and report it in the
Table 4. More details about the top 100 central host proteins are listed in
Supplementary C.
Interestingly, in terms of the number of targeted proteins and which are
also central in host-host PPI, the signaling pathway MAPK is one of the
worst affected pathways among 17 candidate pathways.
Prior researches also identified an exciting fact that viral proteins target
host proteins that are pathway central, i.e., participating in multiple pathways [48]. In addition to PPI centrality, we study the pathway centrality of
the host proteins regarding our 17 signaling pathways. Degree distribution
of host proteins in terms of their density of participation in 17 pathways

where the majority of proteins are participating in only one pathway and
fewer numbers are having high participation in multiple pathways. We list a
few top highly pathway central proteins and few interesting facts in Table 5.
The table shows that the pathway central proteins are also highly connected
in their own PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins.

In this work, we put a novel effort in recreating host-viral PPI using
the codon usage pattern similarity between coding DNA sequences of host
proteins that are participating in a few major signaling pathways and SARSCoV2 viral proteins. We inferred both positive and negative edges between
interacting proteins, which depict an important association between viral
and host proteins. We analyze our inferred network topologically concerning
degree distribution and node centrality. We observed interesting facts on
how viral proteins are targeting their host proteins.
