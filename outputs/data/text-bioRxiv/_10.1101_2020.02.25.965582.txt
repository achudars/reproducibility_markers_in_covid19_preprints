Abstract: Therapeutic options for coronavirus remain limited. To address this unmet medical need,
we screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drugs and bioactives, for activity against a South Korean Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) clinical isolate. Among 221 identified hits, 54 had therapeutic indexes (TI)
greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with selected drugs demonstrated eight and four FDAapproved drugs acted on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Confirmed hits
included several cardiotonic agents (TI >100), atovaquone, an anti-malarial (TI >34), and ciclosonide,
an inhalable corticosteroid (TI >6). Furthermore, utilizing the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV2 (SARS-CoV-2), combinations of remedesivir with selected dugs were evaluated, which identified
ciclosonide and nelfinavir to be additive and synergistic drugs in vitro, respectively. Together, we
screened FDA-approved drugs using patient-derived MERS-CoV, triaged hits to discriminate between
early and late viral life cycle inhibitors, confirmed selected drugs using SARS-CoV-2, and
demonstrated the added value of selected medications in combination with remedesivir. Our results
identify potential therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infections, and provide a basis to treat
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other coronavirus-related illnesses.

1. Introduction

2

Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the

3

Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order. CoV usually cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections

4

[1]. The two types of human coronaviruses that had been described prior to 2003, coronavirus 229E and

5

OC43, caused mild, cold-like symptoms [2,3]. However, an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory

6

Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which occurred mainly in Southeast Asia, was attributed to a coronavirus. That

7

outbreak resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths (fatality rate of 9.6%) [4].

8

In 2012, the novel coronavirus Human Coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (HCoV-EMC) was

9

isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia who developed pneumonia and renal failure [5]. From the first

10

outbreak in 2012 until January 2019, the HCoV-EMC epidemic resulted in 2,449 laboratory-confirmed

11

cases and at least 845 deaths (fatality rate 34%), mainly in the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, HCoV-EMC was

12

renamed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [6]. Another major outbreak of

13

MERS-CoV infection, the largest outside the Arabian Peninsula, occurred in South Korea in 2015 [7,8].

14

Notably, aside from the index case of MERS-CoV, the majority of viral transmissions in South Korea were

15

nosocomial, with 186 confirmed cases across 16 clinics [7,9]. Furthermore, the World Health Organization

16

(WHO) has reported continual waves of MERS outbreaks in the Middle East, although they have been

17

smaller than the major 2014 outbreak [6].

18

Due to the severity of MERS infection and the urgent need for effective treatment, several approaches

19

for therapeutic development have been attempted [10]. In clinical studies, a combination of ribavirin and

20

interferon-alpha (IFN-α) therapy improved patient survival rates when administered early after the onset of

21

infection, but had no significant effect in the late stage of infection [11-13]. These results suggest that broad-

22

spectrum antivirals can be effective in MERS patients at some stages of infection, but for complete antiviral

23

activity, a treatment specific for MERS-CoV may be required.

24

With the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in late

25

2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading worldwide. The ongoing COVID-19

26

pandemic has already caused many human casualties and significant socio-economic losses globally. With

27

more than 60 million COVID-19 cases confirmed and over 1.4 million related fatalities reported (November

28

26th, 2020), there is worldwide effort to control the spread of this devastating virus. Unfortunately, there are

29

no CoV-specific drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use,

30

nor repurposed drugs to efficiently treat COVID-19 patients, yet.

2. Materials and Methods

33

2.1 Cell line and virus

34

Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81; Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in

35

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Welgene, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea) supplemented with 10%

36

heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1X antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific,

37

Waltham, MA, USA). Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55; Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained at 37°C with

38

5% CO2 in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated

39

fetal bovine serum and 1X antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,

40

USA). The Korean strain of MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015; MERS/KOR/2015,

41

Genbank accession no. KT029139.1) [14] was kindly provided by Sung Soon Kim, Division of Respiratory

42

Viruses, Center for Infectious Diseases, Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH), Korea Centers for

43

Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and propagated in Vero cells, as previously described [15]. Viral

44

titers were determined by plaque assays in Vero cells as described [16]. All experiments using MERS-CoV

45

were performed at Institut Pasteur Korea in compliance with the guidelines of the KNIH using enhanced

46

Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment procedures in laboratories approved for use by the KCDC. The

47

SARS-CoV-2 hCoV-19/Norway/Trondheim-S15/2020 strain has been described in a previous study [17].

48

Briefly, the virus was amplified in Vero-E6 cells incubated in DMEM containing Pen/Strep and 0.2% bovine

49

serum albumin. All experiments using SARS-CoV-2 were performed in the BSL-3 at NTNU.

2.2 Compound libraries

51

A compound library of 5,406 compounds composed of FDA-approved drugs, which covers

52

approximately 60% of all FDA-approved compounds, bioactives, kinase inhibitors, and natural products,

53

was compiled (LOPAC, Prestwick, Microsource, Selleck, Tocris) and used for this screen. Compounds were

54

dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and stored at -80°C until use.

55

2.3 Image-based screening assay and assay validation

56

Vero cells were seeded at 1.2 × 104 cells per well in Opti-PRO™ SFM supplemented with 4 mM L-

57

glutamine and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific) in black, 384-well,

58

μClear plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) at 24 h prior to the experiment. Subsequently,

59

compounds were added to each well using an automated liquid handling system (Apricot Designs, Covina,

60

CA, USA) before virus infection. Final concentrations of each compound were 10 μM, and the DMSO

61

concentration was kept at 0.5% or lower. For viral infection, plates were transferred into the BL-3

62

containment facility to add MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0625, and cells were fixed

63

at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) with 4% PFA followed by immunofluorescence analyses. MERS-CoV

64

infection was detected using rabbit anti-MERS-CoV S antibodies, and cell viability was evaluated by

65

Hoechst 33342 staining. Images were acquired by a Perkin Elmer Operetta (20×; Waltham, MA, USA) and

66

analyzed by in-house developed Image Mining 3.0 (IM 3.0) plug-in software. To validate the assay, dose-

67

response curves (DRCs) with four compounds with known antiviral activities against MERS-CoV were

68

assessed: CQ, CPZ, CsA, and LPV [18,19]. Compounds with >70% MERS-CoV inhibition and >70%

69

viability were subjected to DRC analyses, as described below.

70

2.4 Dose-response curve drug analysis

71

The primary hits (256 hits) were used to generate 10-point DRCs, with compound concentrations from

72

0.05–25 μM. The acquired images were analyzed using in-house software to quantify cell numbers and

73

infection ratios. The antiviral activity was normalized to positive (mock) and negative (0.5% DMSO)

74

controls in each assay plate. DRCs were fitted by sigmoidal dose-response models, and the equation was

75

described as Y = Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/(1 + (IC50/X)Hillslope) using XLfit 4 Software or Prism7. The IC50

76

was calculated from the normalized activity data set fitted curve. All IC50 and CC50 values were measured

77

in duplicate and the quality of each assay was controlled by Z′-factor and the coefficient of variation in

78

percent (%CV).

79

2.5 Pharmacological action clustering

80

The information regarding pharmacological actions of each compound was compiled by using

81

ChemIDPlus and MESH databases [20,21] and information provided by the vendors. Once relevant

82

information was collected, pharmacological actions were manually reassessed to finally categorize all

83

compounds into 43 different pharmacological actions. The information on approval status for drugs was

84

retrieved from DrugBank, version 5.0.7 [22].

85

2.6 Drug combination studies

86

Vero-E6 cells were treated with different concentrations of two drugs and infected with SARS-CoV-

87

2 at an MOI 0.1 or mock. At 72 hpi, cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison,

88

WI, USA). The observed responses were compared to expected combination responses. The expected

89

responses were calculated based on the zero interaction potency (ZIP) reference model using SynergyFinder

90

version 2 [17]. Briefly, the degree of combination synergy, or antagonism, is quantified by comparing the

91

observed drug combination response against the expected response, calculated using a reference model that

92

assumes no interaction between drugs. Synergy scores, which represent an averaged percentage excess

93

effect due to interactions between drugs and are the most common metric to summarize the drug interaction,

94

were quantified. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of each drug combination, determined by the quantification

95

of ATP level (CellTiter-Glo), was subtracted. Combinations with scores >10 are considered synergistic,

96

scores between -10 and 10 additive, and below -10 antagonistic

3. Results

100

To address the urgent unmet need to develop effective treatments for CoV patients, we implemented

101

a high-content screening (HCS) strategy with the goal of repurposing newly identified MERS-CoV

102

inhibitors for a wider range of CoV, including COVID-19. Utilizing a Korean MERS-CoV patient isolate,

103

we screened 5,406 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs, bioactive agents, kinase inhibitors, and

104

natural products. Our library included 60% of all FDA-approved drugs (1,247 out of 2,069 total) (Fig. 1A).

105

Compounds were tested for activity against MERS-CoV by analyzing the levels of expression of viral spike

106

(S) protein in infected Vero cells using immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). The screens included the

107

reference inhibitor chloroquine (IC90 = 93 μM) at 100 μM to define maximum inhibition (De Wilde et al.,

108

2014). The calculated Z'-factor above 0.78 indicated good discrimination between the control dimethyl

109

sulfoxide (DMSO) and chloroquine treatment of infected cells (Fig. 1B). Two independent HCS analyses

110

(screen 1 and screen 2) were conducted, demonstrating a high degree of correlation (R2 = 0.91) between the

111

two replicates (Fig. 1C). These screens identified 256 compounds that demonstrated >70% MERS-CoV

112

inhibition and >70% cell viability (Fig. 1D). These primary hits were then confirmed using 10-point dose-

113

response curve (DRC) analysis to determine IC50 and 50% cytotoxicity concentrations (CC50) for each

114

compound (Fig. 1D). A representative DRC analysis is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The therapeutic

115

index (TI) was calculated as the ratio of CC50/IC50. Among the 256 initial hits, 35 compounds were denoted

116

as inactive (TI values <1), and were eliminated from the list of confirmed hits. Of the resulting 221

117

confirmed hits, 54 compounds with an in vitro TI >6 were selected for further testing (Fig. 1D).

128

To investigate whether the FDA-approved drugs act on the early or late stages of the viral life cycle

129

(pre- or post-entry), we conducted time-of-addition studies. Vero cells were treated with each drug at a

130

concentration above its IC90, and analyzed as described in the Supplementary Information. Chloroquine

131

served as an early-stage inhibitor control, and inhibited MERS-CoV infection by up to 30% until 3 hpi.

132

However, chloroquine had no significant effect when administered at 4 hpi (Fig. 2). A similar outcome was

133

observed for treatment with ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin, niclosamide, regorafenib, nelfinavir mesylate,

134

ciclesonide, and benidipine hydrochloride, all of which inhibited MERS-CoV infection only when

135

administered earlier than 4 hpi (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, atovaquone, lercanidipine

136

hydrochloride, permethrin, and octocrylene had only minor inhibitory effects throughout the time-course

137

assay (Supplementary Fig. 2).

were analyzed by time-course experiments to determine the stage of the MERS-CoV life cycle

inhibited. Vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and FDA-

142

approved drugs were administered at six time points pre- or post-infection as indicated. Drugs were

143

used at concentrations above their 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) values. Chloroquine served

144

as a known early-stage inhibitor.

145
146

Remdesivir, a drug which was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was recently

147

approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In previous experiments, we uncovered synergism

148

between remedesivir and several other drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells [17]. Therefore, we tested

149

remdesivir in combination with nelfinavir or ciclesonide. As references, we used camostat and

150

cepharanthine in SARS-CoV-2- and mock-infected Vero-E6 cells, and evaluated virus-mediated

151

cytotoxicity by determining ATP level as described before. Each drug combination was tested by a 6x6

152

dose-response matrix, where five doses of single drugs are combined in a pairwise manner. We subtracted

153

drug combination responses measured on virus-infected cells from those measured on mock-infected cells.

154

As a result, we obtained dose-response matrices demonstrating selective virus inhibition achieved by each

155

combination. For each drug combination, we calculated ZIP synergy scores and plotted synergy distribution

156

maps, showing synergy at each pairwise dose. Thereby, we observed additive effects between remdesivir

157

and cepharanthine, as well as remdesivir and ciclesonide, whereas remdesivir-camostat and remdesivir-

158

nelfinavir combinations showed synergistic effects (Fig. 3A-D). Drug combination results are summarized

159

in Table 1. Thus, these drug combinations should be further investigated in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion

174

Our approach aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs and bioactives that could be promptly

175

repurposed or developed, respectively, to treat MERS-CoV and potentially COVID-19-infected patients. In

176

previously reported studies, small molecule libraries that were screened against MERS-CoV included

177

approximately 300 drugs with FDA approval or that were in clinical development [19,23]. Our screen

178

included 1,247 FDA-approved drugs, and as a result, we identified drugs not found in previous studies,

179

indicating that further opportunities exist for identifying novel anti-CoV drugs by screening larger libraries

180

of FDA-approved drugs and bioactives. Moreover, despite having used a different viral isolate than in earlier

181

reports, we corroborated four previously identified hits, including emetine dihydrochloride, ouabain,

182

cycloheximide, and nelfinavir mesylate. This strongly suggests that the drugs reproducibly identified in our

183

HCS assays and in the previously published screens could be repurposed as potential therapeutic options for

184

patients suffering from CoV infections [23].

185

Fig. 4 shows classification of library compounds into 43 categories of pharmacological action,

186

according to publicly available drug databases. Notably, the cardiovascular agents category contained 14 of

187

the 54 final hit compounds (26%). These belong to a class of cardiac glycosides, naturally derived agents

188

that are used for treating cardiac abnormalities and modulating sodium-potassium pump action [24].

189

Glycosides have also been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against the herpes simplex virus and human

11

190

cytomegalovirus [25,26]. Consistent with these previous studies, our data indicate that the cardiac

191

glycosides ouabain, digitoxin, and digoxin also efficiently inhibit MERS-CoV infection. Ouabain has been

192

found to block cellular entry by CoV, such as MERS-CoV, through Src kinase signaling [27]. Based on

193

these data, we speculate that cardiac glycosides may exert anti-MERS-CoV activity through blockade of

194

viral entry. However, more experimental work will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which

195

this occurs.

202

Drug development may be hastened by repurposing FDA-approved drugs and inhibitors with known

203

biological functions, pharmacological activities, and safety profiles. Therefore, we prioritized 12 FDA-

204

approved drugs and six bioactives not yet reported to have anti-CoV activities; their information is

205

summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Important to note, a follow-up study confirmed seven of the

206

12 FDA-approved drugs listed in Table 1 as active against SARS-CoV-2 [28]. An additional 26 inhibitors

207

that our HCS identified include bioactives and drugs that have been studied in clinical trials. A ranking of

208

these inhibitors according to therapeutic index (SI) values, ranging from >6 to >156, is shown in

Our time-of addition studies demonstrated chloroquine to be effective agains MERS-CoV only if

227

administered no later than 3 hpi (Fig. 2), and this was also the case for ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin,

228

niclosamide, regorafenib, nelfinavir mesylate, ciclesonide, and benidipine hydrochloride (Fig. 2,

229

Supplementary Fig. 2). Important to note, ciclesonide, an immune system suppressor used to treat asthma

230

and allergic rhinitis, was recently shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [29], the cause of COVID-19, and was

231

reported by Japanese medical doctors to have improved pneumonia symptoms in multiple COVID-19

232

patients [30]. Our data are consistent with previous reports, which indicated that ouabain and other

233

cardiotonic steroids effectively block clathrin-mediated CoV endocytosis [10,27]. In contrast, the minor

234

inhibitory effects we observed for atovaquone, lercanidipine hydrochloride, permethrin, and octocrylene

235

throughout the time-course indicated that these drugs likely act at later stages of the viral life cycle

236

(Supplementary Fig. 2). Notably, our results indicate that lercanidipine hydrochloride and benidipine

237

hydrochloride, both dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, display different patterns of viral inhibition

238

[31,32]. This observation could be explained by the different channel selectivity of the two drugs: benidipine

239

hydrochloride blocks triple voltage-gated calcium channels, whereas lercanidipine hydrochloride blocks

240

single voltage-gated channels [33-35]. A dendrogram showing the structural relationship of 36 selected

241

inhibitors with anti-MERS-CoV activity is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

242

Combination therapies have become a standard for the treatment for human immunodeficiency virus

243

(HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. They are advantageous over monotherapies due to better

244

antiviral efficacy, reduced toxicity, as well as the ability to prevent the development of viral drug resistance,

245

etc. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that in combination with remdesivir, camostat, and nelfinavir, as

246

well as cepharanthine, have additive and synergistic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro, respectively.

247

Therefore, our identified drugs, in combination with remdesivir, could be administered to risk group patients

248

prior to the onset of clinical symptoms, thereby reducing the viral load and ideally preventing deterioration

249

of vital signs. Furthermore, depending on the sufficient availability of such drugs, in non-symptomatic

250

COVID-19 patients, such therapies could potentially be employed to reduce the viral load and consequently

251

lower the probability of virus spread in the population, to reduce quarantine periods, etc.

252

In summary, we identified 12 FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed for MERS-CoV or

253

potentially COVID-19 therapy, in mono or combination with other drugs. However, further in vitro studies

254

are needed to investigate their exact antiviral mechanisms, and to determine potential synergistic effects, in

255

order to prioritize and select drugs for potential use in randomized, double-blind clinical trials, which are

256

mandatory to assess their safe use in humans.

Supplementary Material and Methods
Reagents
Chloroquine diphosphate (CQ; C6628), chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ; C8138), and
cyclosporine A (CsA; C1832) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Lopinavir
(LPV; S1380) was purchased from SelleckChem (Houston, TX, USA). Chloroquine was dissolved in
Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Welgene, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea), and other
reagents were dissolved in DMSO for the screening. Anti-MERS-CoV S antibody was purchased from
Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody
and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Molecular Probes/Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (32% aqueous solution) and normal goat serum were purchased from
Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA, USA) and Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA,
USA), respectively.
Time-of-addition assays
Twelve FDA-approved drugs were selected after DRC analysis for time-of-addition assays to
characterize the mechanism of action. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded at 1.2 × 10 4 cells per well in

Opti-PRO™ SFM supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution in
black, 96-well, μClear plates (Greiner Bio-One) at 24 h prior to the experiment. Subsequently, cells
were infected with MERS-CoV/KOR/2015 at an MOI of 5 at 4˚C for 1 h to synchronize the infection,
followed by three washes with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and transferred to a
37˚C incubator. Drugs were added to cells at various time points pre- or post-infection; 1 h prior to or
at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hpi. Drugs were added to infected cells at a concentration of 1, 5, or 10 µM depending
on the IC90 value of the compound. Chloroquine, which was used as an early stage inhibitor control,
was used at a concentration of 100 µM. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA at 6 hpi. IFA and image analyses
were performed as described above.
