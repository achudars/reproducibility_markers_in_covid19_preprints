Abstract

14

There is an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs to alleviate the current COVID-19 pandemic.

15

Here, we rationally designed and developed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides to degrade

16

envelope and spike RNAs of SARS-CoV-2. Each oligonucleotide comprises a 3 antisense

17

sequence for target recognition and a 5 -phosphorylated 2-5 poly(A)4 for guided ribonuclease L

18

(RNase L) activation. Since RNase L can potently cleave single strand RNA during innate antiviral

19

response, the improved degradation efficiency of chimeric oligonucleotides was twice as much as

20

classic antisense oligonucleotides in Vero cells, for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. In

21

pseudovirus infection models, one of chimeric oligonucleotides targeting spike RNA achieved

22

potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and its recently reported N501Y and/or

23

ΔH69/ΔV70 mutants. These results showed that the constructed chimeric oligonucleotides could

24

efficiently degrade pathogenic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 facilitated by immune activation, showing

25

promising potentials as antiviral nucleic acid drugs for COVID-19.

Introduction

29

Since the infection was first reported in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

30

(SARS-CoV-2) has continued to spread globally and caused the pandemic COVID-19 disease (1).

31

The current lack of highly effective antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 has made the treatment of

32

infected patients more difficult, thus demanding more candidate options for drug discovery.

33

Genomic positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and structural proteins participate in virus

34

packaging, which is an essential step in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Envelope (E), spike (S) and

35

membrane (M) proteins assemble the virus membrane in host cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 (2,

36

3), and thus become ideal drug targets to intervene virus proliferation.

37

RNase L participates in innate antiviral response of vertebrate cells by cleaving UN^N sites located

38

in viral or cellular ssRNAs. Cytoplasmic RNase L monomer only displays weak catalytic cleavage

39

on the substrate. However, upon dimerization induced by its specific ligand 5 phosphorylated 2-

40

5 polyA (such as 4A2-5), RNase L is highly activated and performs intense RNA cleavage (4). The

41

cleavage products can further bind to intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to stimulate

42

the production of interferons (IFN) (5-7), which in turn induces the expression of interferon

43

stimulated genes (ISGs) including RNase L, to enhance the antiviral response (2, 7, 8). Ubiquitous

44

activation of RNase L might cause widespread attenuation of basal mRNA and possible cell

45

apoptosis, especially at high doses of 4A2-5 (9-12). Guided and controlled activation of RNase L

46

could otherwise achieve more specific target RNA degradation. RNA binding small molecules

47

conjugated with 4A2-5 have been reported to target highly-structured microRNA or RNA fragments

48

of virus genome (13, 14), which contains particularly structured sequences. Nevertheless, the

49

selective binding between a small molecule and the specific region of pathogenic RNA is limited,

50

while the sequence-selective antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) will be more accessible and

51

effective to target viral RNA of interest.

52

ASO therapy has successfully targeted undruggable pathogenic genes of rare diseases and has been

53

developed against the infection of ssRNA viruses such as SARS-CoV (15) in a sequence-specific

54

manner. Chemical modifications on ASOs can further promote their nuclease resistance and/or

55

binding affinity to target RNA sequences, such as phosphorothioate (PS) linkages and 2’-O-methyl

56

(2’-OMe) substituents (16). Currently a few reports have raised the possibility of combining ASOs

57

with 4A2-5 for the treatment of tumors (17) and viral infections (12, 18). Therefore, it is promising

58

to develop nucleic acid drugs in form of ASO-4A2-5 chimera targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic

59

RNAs to inhibit virus infection.

60

Here, based on nucleic acid-hydrolysis targeting chimeras strategy, we developed chimeric

61

antisense oligonucleotides with 4A2-5 conjugation through flexible PEG linker to target envelope

62

RNA (Chimera-E) or spike RNA (Chimera-S) of SARS-CoV-2. The antisense component

63

specifically recognizes complementary target RNA sequence, while the covalently linked 4A2-5

64

moiety functions as RNase L recruiter, thus collectively guiding RNase L to specific cleavage sites

65

on targeted viral RNA. With these ASO-4A2-5 chimeras, we evaluated RNA knockdown of both

66

SARS-CoV-2 envelope and spike genes in Vero cells. Further in a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2

67

infection model, ASO-4A2-5 chimeras for spike gene successfully inhibited pseudovirus packaging

68

and further infection on host cells. One of these chimeras targeting spike gene also effectively

69

inhibited three mutants of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, including N501Y, ΔH69/ΔV70, and the

70

recently discovered dual-site mutations with higher spreading ability. In addition, these chimeras

71

could upregulate the expression of RNase L and cytokines (such as IFN-β and IL-6) as antiviral

72

immune responses in vitro. The antiviral efficacy and versatility of the 4A2-5-modified chimeric

73

oligonucleotides provide a new treatment option for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

77

Rational design and characterization of RNase L-recruiting chimeric antisense

78

oligonucleotides

79

Our study began with the selection of antisense oligonucleotides targeting specific genomic RNA

80

of SARS-CoV-2. After predicting RNA secondary structures of spike receptor binding domain (S-

81

RBD) and envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2, loops composed of more than 10 nucleotides

82

were selected as ideal target regions. In addition, considering the space required for RNase L

83

activation and substrate cleavage, the stem structure in 3 proximity of the selected loop was limited

84

to have less than 4 base pairs, and its 3 pairing end should have more than 1 RNase L cleavage

85

site (UN^N) in a bulge structure. As a result, antisense sequences complementary to the selected

86

loops were predicted with more than 70% probability of being efficient antisense strands as

87

evaluated by OligoWalk (19) and was synthesized through solid phase synthesis (Table S1).To

88

enhance nuclease resistance and binding affinity with their complementary viral RNA regions,

89

phosphorothioate (PS) linkages and 2-O-methyl (2-OMe) substituents were properly incorporated

90

into the chimeric structure, followed by the coupling of a poly 2-5 poly(A)4 ligand at 5 terminus

91

of the designed antisense sequence (15 nt) through a short PEG linker (Fig. 1B).

92

We first tested RNase L recruitment ability of Chimera-E-PO, an oligonucleotide modified with 5

93

native 4A2-5 ligand and complementary to a loop structure on Cy3-labeled partial E-RNA sequence

94

of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1). As shown in Fig 1C, after incubating RNase L with Chimera-E-PO

95

or 4A2-5, in vitro cleavage of Cy3-labeled substrate RNA was analyzed in a denaturing PAGE gel.

96

Treatment of RNase L alone did not lead to the cleavage of substrate RNA, while additional

97

Chimera-E-PO treatment activated RNase L and produced cleavage bands in a manner different

98

from that of 4A2-5 treated group. The cleavage preferences of Chimera-E-PO for these specific

99

cleavage sites indicated its specific binding for RNA substrate.

100

Evaluation of ASO-4A2-5 chimera for viral RNA knockdown and pseudovirus inhibition of

101

SARS-CoV-2

102

We first selected envelope gene featured with a relative short viral RNA sequence, and evaluated

103

E-RNA degradation efficiency using Chimera-E in Vero cells after co-transfection of pCAG-

104

nCoV-E-FLAG plasmids. As we expected, treatment of 20 nM ASO-E alone could only partially

105

downregulate E-RNA level to 83% in comparison to the negative control, while treatment of 20

106

nM Chimera-E downregulated E-RNA level to 35%, 2-fold more efficiently than that of ASO-E as

107

measured by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2A). In addition, RNase L transcription level was also significantly

108

increased with higher concentration of Chimera-E (Fig. 2B) which may further enhance the RNase

109

L induced sequence-specific degradation of E-RNA. This result showed that Chimera-E could

110

potently decreased intracellular E-RNA levels facilitated by RNase L activation, which inspired us

111

to develop 4A2-5-ASO chimeras for spike protein, a more promising target to inhibit SARS-CoV-

112

2 infection.

113

The on-target effects of three previously designed chimeric oligonucleotides (Table S1) against

114

the spike RNA (S-RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated in Vero cells using RT-qPCR (Fig. 3A).

115

After co-transfection of pCAG-nCoV-S-FLAG plasmids and 80 nM oligonucleotides for 24 hours,

116

all chimeras (Chimera-S) and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO-S) decreased S-RNA down to less

117

than 50% level of negative control. Comparing ASO-S and Chimera-S containing the same

118

antisense oligonucleotide sequence, more than 2-fold enhancement of S-RNA degradation was

119

observed for Chimera-S that was able to activate endogenous RNase L by 4A2-5 moiety. Among

120

three chimeric antisense oligonucleotides, Chimera-S4 displayed the highest enhancement in S-

121

RNA degradation compared with its control group (ASO-S4). In addition, RNase L transcription

122

levels in Vero cells upon the treatment of Chimera-S4, Chimera-S5 and Chimera-S6 were 2- ~ 4Page 4 of 20

123

fold higher than that of corresponding negative control, while all three antisense oligonucleotides

124

without the conjugation of 4A2-5 had no obvious effects on RNase L transcription (Fig. 3B). These

125

results reconfirmed that chimeric ASO conjugated with 4A2-5 efficiently activated cellular RNase

126

L which further enhanced the degradation of target viral RNA.

127

To further compare their efficiencies of S-RNA degradation and viral packaging inhibition, all

128

above three chimeric oligonucleotides (Chimera-S4, Chimera-S5 and Chimera-S6) were applied to

129

HEK293T packaging cells in a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection model (Fig. 3C). Since

130

chimeric oligonucleotides led to the degradation of S-RNA, decrease of S protein expression and

131

pseudovirus production could be observed. For titration of pseudovirus, two reporter genes, GFP

132

and firefly luciferase were carried by pseudovirus. A hACE2 expressed cell line HEK293T-hACE2

133

was also established for pseudovirus titration. To examine effects of chimeric oligonucleotides on

134

the transfection efficiency in pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection model, GFP level in HEK293T

135

packaging cell was compared. As expected, all groups showed similar GFP level (Fig. S1),

136

indicating similar transfection efficiency in HEK293T packaging cells. In the infection model,

137

Chimera-S4 was more potent to reduce titer of pseudovirus. At 40 nM and 80 nM, Chimera-S4

138

treatment reduced luminescence to 24% and 6% respectively, comparing to the corresponding

139

control group, while firefly luminescence was down to 45% and 14% for Chimera-S5, 50% and

140

28% for Chimera-S6 at the same concentrations (Fig. 3D). Meanwhile, scrambled oligonucleotide

141

showed no inhibition of pseudovirus, confirming the on-target effect of Chimera-S. GFP level of

142

HEK293T-hACE2 was also monitored and Chimera-S4 also showed the most promising inhibition

143

efficiency (Fig. 3E), which was consistent with luciferase assay. These results clearly showed that

144

Chimera-S4 was the most effective and promising antiviral candidate among above Chimera-S

145

oligonucleotides and could be used for further assessment.

146

Chimera-S4 as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus packaging

147

We further investigated the concentration dependence of Chimera S4 for S-RNA degradation. RT-

148

qPCR results showed that 20 nM Chimera-S4 induced a reduction of S-RNA up to 80%. Increasing

149

its concentration to 80 nM only led to slight enhancement of S-RNA reduction, but would cause

150

an approximately 2-fold up-regulation of RNase L expression (Fig. 4A, 4B). Surprisingly, the titers

151

of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus dropped sharply from 60% to 6% when the concentration of

152

Chimera-S4 increased from 20 to 80 nM (Fig. 4C). In comparison to the individual ASO-S4 and

153

4A2-5, Chimera-S4 degraded S-RNA in Vero cells with up to 4.5- and 2.1-fold higher efficiency at

154

40 nM concentration (Fig. 4A). In addition, 2.9- and 1.4-fold higher upregulation of RNase L were

155

also observed upon 80 nM Chimera S4 treatment (Fig. 4B). Compared with physically mixed 4A2-

156

5

157

20 nM ~ 80 nM concentrations. However, the result of luciferase assays showed that Chimera-S4

158

displayed 3.8- and 19.2-fold higher inhibitory effects on viral titers at 40 nM and 80 nM than those

159

of 4A2-5 + ASO-S4 group in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4C). To reconfirm the efficiency of Chimera-

160

S4, GFP expression in infected HEK293T-hACE2 cells was also analyzed by flow cytometry. The

161

positive rate of GFP fluorescent cells treated with 40 nM Chimera-S4 was 29.07%, much lower

162

than those of negative control (81.46%), 4A2-5 (71.35%), ASO-S4 (69.06%) and 4A2-5+ASO-S4

163

(65.70%) groups under the same assay conditions (Fig. 4D), and could be further enhanced at

164

higher concentrations of Chimera-S4 (Fig. S2). Fluorescent images of infected HEK293T-hACE2

165

cells were consistent with the results presented by flow cytometry (Fig. 4E, Fig. S2). Similarly,

166

GFP fluorescence in HEK293T packaging cells confirmed the consistency of transfection

167

efficiency across different groups (Fig. S2). All these results clearly showed that Chimera-S4 could

168

efficiently reduce S-RNA level in a RNase L-facilitated manner and effectively inhibit SARS-

169

CoV-2 pseudovirus at moderate doses, without serious damage to cell status or viability (Fig. S2,

170

Fig. S3).

171

As mentioned in the above results, Chimera-S4 obviously induced the up-regulation of RNase L,

172

which also participated in antiviral immunity and activated the expression of other antiviral

173

proteins, such as IFN-β and IL-6. Thus, we also assayed these intracellular mRNA levels of IFN-β

174

and IL-6 after the activation of RNase L induced by Chimera-S4 (Fig. S3). When A549 cells were

175

transfected with Chimera-S4 at different concentrations from 40 nM to 80 nM, the relative mRNA

176

levels of IFN-β and IL-6 simultaneously increased from 5.9- to 26-fold and 2.0- to 7.5-fold in a

177

concentration-dependent manner, respectively. In addition, Chimera-S4 induced much higher

178

levels of antiviral proteins than those of individual 4A2-5, ASO-S4 and 4A2-5 + ASO-S4 mixture,

179

indicating its higher potential to simultaneously activate antiviral immune response in SARS-CoV-

180

2 therapy.

181

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus mutants by Chimera-S4

182

Mutation ΔH69/ΔV70 and N501Y on spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to cause

183

S-gene target failure (SGTF) and greatly increase viral transmissibility (20, 21). To assess the

184

broad-spectrum inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 mutants, Chimera-S4 was then co-transfected with

and ASO-S4 (4A2-5 + ASO-S4), Chimera-S4 led to similar reduction of S-RNA in Vero cells at

185

pseudovirus packaging plasmids carrying ΔH69/ΔV70, N501Y or dual-site mutations into

186

HEK293T packaging cells for further viral inhibition assay. Transfection efficiencies in HEK293T

187

cells across different groups were consistent (Fig. S4). luciferase assay showed that titer of all three

188

mutants were reduced to less than 20% after 48 hours treatment of 40 nM Chimera-S4 (Fig. 5A),

189

which indicated a more robust inhibition of viral infection than those of 4A2-5, ASO-S4, 4A2-5 +

190

ASO-S4 and scrambled sequences. GFP fluorescence analysis in infected HEK293T-hACE2 cells

191

also displayed the same inhibiting manner as the firefly luciferase assay (Fig. 5B). These results

192

indicated that Chimera-S4 could generally and efficiently inhibit the packaging and infection of

193

ΔH69/ΔV70 and/or N501Y mutated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in vitro.

194
195

Discussion

196

We demonstrated that 4A2-5-chimeric antisense oligonucleotides (4A2-5-ASO) displayed potent

197

antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants by degrading target viral RNA of structural

198

proteins through recruiting endogenous RNase L. In vitro cleavage assay validated that chimeric

199

oligonucleotides could activate RNase L to cleave target RNA in a manner different from 4A2-5

200

induced substrate RNA cleavage, indicating its sequence-specific targeting process. Co-

201

transfection of Chimera-E or Chimera-S with plasmids for E-RNA or S-RNA in Vero cells

202

achieved up to 65% and 80% downregulation of RNA targets at 20 nM, which is much more

203

efficient than that of corresponding classic ASOs, and much more unlikely to cause ubiquitous

204

basal RNA decay due to 4A2-5 induced RNase L activation. Instead of IFN-deficient Vero cells,

205

human alveolar basal epithelial cells A549 have been used to evaluate upregulation of IFN-β and

206

IL-6 in a reprogrammed antiviral state upon RNase L activation (9). Upon treatment of Chimera-

207

S4, the upregulation of antiviral gene transcription like IFN-β and IL-6 in A549 cells was observed,

208

which is consistent with the intense activation of RNase L triggered by Chimera-S4. Due to the

209

positive feedback of IFN-β on RNase L activation (11) and host defense against virus infection,

210

4A2-5-ASO chimera shows a strong inhibitory effect on virus proliferation at relatively low

211

concentrations. Moreover, the mutation sites of spike genes corresponding to N501Y and

212

ΔH69/ΔV70 are not overlaid with the target sequence of S-RBD RNA and can be still recognized

213

by Chimera-S4, thus barely influencing its targeting process required for efficient S-RNA

214

degradation. Therefore, in infection models of all three SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus mutants, strong

215

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 packaging and infection was still successfully achieved.

216

Due to the acute shortage of biosafety level 4 conditions in the global COVID-19 pandemic, we

217

currently have no chance to further evaluate the inhibitory effect of our chimeric 4A2-5-ASO on

218

natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we did confirm that chimeric oligonucleotides could

219

efficiently inhibit viral proliferation in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection model. And these

220

exogenous ASO could be effectively delivered into lung tissues according to previously reported

221

delivery strategies (22, 23), which would further expand their potential applications in vivo.

222

Furthermore, interferons themselves are also therapeutic agents used for virus immunotherapy (24,

223

25) if severe release of proinflammatory cytokines is well controlled.(26).

224

In conclusion, we developed a group of 4A2-5 chimeric oligonucleotides based on nucleic acid-

225

hydrolysis targeting chimera strategy (NATAC) and successfully down-regulated target SARS-

226

CoV-2 RNAs. Among them, Chimera-S4 showed the most potent degradation of S-RBD RNA and

227

the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Compared with classic ASO silencing strategy,

228

Chimera-S4 also activated RNase L, which significantly improved RNA degradation efficiency,

229

and induced additional antiviral immune response upon its recruitment by 4A2-5 ligand. This

230

chimeric sequence still showed robust inhibiting capability toward three highly transmissible

231

SARS-CoV-2 mutants involving N501Y and ΔH69/ΔV70 mutations. Antisense oligonucleotides

232

have the characteristics of sequence-specific targeting, convenient design and synthesis, which

233

make this 4A2-5-ASO chimera suitable for further development of nucleic acid drugs combating

234

foreseeable evolving COVID-19 pandemics.

Experimental Design

239

We developed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides with enhanced degradation of target viral RNA

240

and potent antiviral efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 facilitated by RNase L. Sequences of

241

oligonucleotides, protein of purified GST-RNase L, plasmids and cell lines required by

242

pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection model were prepared first. Then in vitro RNase L cleavage

243

assay and primary RT-qPCR assay in Vero cells were carried out to validate the RNase L recruiting

244

mechanism of the chimeric design. Next, we screened three chimera candidates targeting S-RBD

245

gene of SARS-CoV-2 for the most efficient one through evaluating their downregulation of S-RNA

246

by RT-qPCR in Vero cells and the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus packaging in HEK293T

247

cells. Mutants of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus involving N501Y and/or ΔH69/ΔV70 mutations were

also included. Further concentration dependence, regulation of IFN-β and IL-6 as well as influence

364

Then, 6 h post transfection, the medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS and

365

1 mM nonessential amino acids. Next, the lentiviral-containing supernatant was harvested at 48 h

366

post transfection and filtered by a 0.45 μm filter (Pall). The resultant lentiviruses were used to

367

integrate hACE2 gene into the genome of HEK293T cells. Procedure of stable lentiviral

368

transduction was carried out as follows: HEK293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and

369

transducted 24 h later with lentiviral filtrate in presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene (Macgene). Then,

370

selection was performed under the pressure of 1 μg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen) until cells died

371

completely. Then the cell line was verified by western blot.

372

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

373

Construction of a VSV pseudovirus carrying the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was formerly

374

reported (30) and introduced in brief. HEK293T cells were used for pseudovirus packaging.

381

pseudoviruses were further analyzed for viral tilter by flow cytometry and luciferase assay.

382

Pseudovirus infection and luciferase assay

383

In order to determine the titration of pseudovirus, expression of firefly luciferase was conducted as

384

follows: HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded into 96-well black/clear bottom plates (Nunc) at

385

5×103 cells per well and cultured for 24 h. Then the medium was replaced by 100 μL pseudovirus

386

pLenti-FLuc-GFP filtrate and cells were incubated for another 48 h. Expression of firefly luciferase

387

was quantitated by Bright Glo™ luciferase assay system (Promega) and the plates were read using

388
