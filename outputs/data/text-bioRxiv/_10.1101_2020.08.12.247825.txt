Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into
human cells. The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and
severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of
ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in
multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune
response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II
pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry
remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and
increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar
epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our
results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung
epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of
granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced
interferon-γ (IFN-γ)- induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving
upregulating IFN-γ receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the
upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially
reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs. Our study identified TRIM28 as a
novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough and fatigue,
it has rapidly spread to 213 countries and areas, with over 19, 936, 210 total confirmed cases,
732, 499 deaths as of Aug 11, 2020 (WHO, https://covid19.who.int/). COVID-19 is caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have
reported that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is mediated by
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1], which was previously reported to be the
receptor for SARS-CoV [1, 2]. Meanwhile, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells is
facilitated by a host cell serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which
cleaves and activates the viral spike glycoporteins to promote virus-cell membrane fusion.
The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 determine the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and
potentially drive the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 [3, 4], it is thus of importance to
understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression to develop
effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is recently shown to be co-expressed with ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 in type II pneumocytes [5], but its roles in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 receptor
and cell entry remain unclear. In this study, we identified TRIM28 as a key factor of ACE2
expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. TRIM28 belongs to TRIM protein family, which
comprises of more than 70 members and plays important roles in antiviral restriction,
endogenous retrovirus (ERV) latency and immune signaling transduction [6, 7]. For example,
TRIM5α restricts human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection by targeting viral capsid protein
and causing viral premature [8]. TRIM22 and TRIM32 can induce proteasomal degradation of
viral protein, interact with the viral Gag protein and interfere with its trafficking to the plasma
membrane [9, 10]. TRIM25 interacts with viral ribonucleoprotein to prevent the viral
polymerase from accessing viral RNA template [11]. TRIM28 can associate with viral
genome to induce latency of human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and herpesvirus and
transcriptional inhibition of ERVs [12-14]. Moreover, several TRIM proteins have been
implicated in autophagy-mediated viral clearance [15]. More detailed TRIM antiviral
functions had been well summarized previously [16]. On the other hand, TRIM proteins are
shown to have cross-talk with immune system during antiviral restriction. Many TRIM genes
are induced following infection with retroviruses, and function as downstream effectors of
interferon (IFN)-γ to modulate innate immune responses to viral infections. Knockdown of
TRIM genes limits virus-induced interferon production, enhances virus replication and leads
to a defect in activations of IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs), nuclear factor-κB and activating
protein-1[17]. Furthermore, TRIM genes are crucial regulators of T cell homeostasis, natural
killer (NK) and pre-B cell functions [18, 19]. In this study, we investigated the role of
TRIM28 in the expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry in lung epithelial cells and
how TRIM28 contributed to the crosstalk between NK cells and lung epithelial cells. Our
results also shed lights on the effect of dexamethasone on TRIM28-modulated ACE2 levels in
lung epithelial cells.

Cell culture and reagents
A549 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Takara Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd., China), 100
U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C with 5%
CO 2 . The NK-92 cells were cultured in the α-MEM medium containing 12.5% FBS, 12.5%
heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 200U/mL of
recombinant human interleukin-2, and 100 U/mL of penicillin and streptomycin. Human
pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiC), human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HSMCs) were purchased from ScienCell
(Carlsbad, CA, USA). Human PAEpiCs were cultured in alveolar epithelial cell medium
containing epithelial cell growth supplement (ScienCell Company) and 2% FBS in 5% CO2
at 37 °C. Human PAEpiCs at passage 0 were used for all experiments. HUVECs and HSMCs
were cultured in EC medium containing EC growth supplement (ScienCell Company) and
SMC medium containing SMC growth supplement (ScienCell), respectively. OPTI-MEM
medium, lipofectamine RNAi MAX and RNAiso reagent were purchased from Invitrogen.
The cDNA synthesis kits and SYBR Green Master Mix were obtained from Clontech
(Mountain View, CA, USA). Dexamethasone and Granzyme B inhibitor Z-AAD-CMKwere
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant human IFN-γ was
purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Antibody against TRIM28 was purchased
from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies against phospho-STAT1 and STAT1
and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
Co-culture of NK-92 cells and epithelial cells
NK-92 cells were co-cultured with A549 cells or PAEpiCs at the ratio of 2:1. In the contact
culture experiment, A549 cells or PAEpiCs were maintained in 12-well and 24-well culture
plates at a density of 1×105/mL and 2 × 104 /mL, respectively. NK-92 cells were placed
directly on top of A549 or PAEpiC cell layer and co-cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. In the
non-contact culture experiment, a transwell with 0.4 µm pore polycarbonate membrane insert
(Falcon, NJ, USA) was used. The NK-92 cells were cultured in the insert chamber, and the
A549 cells were cultured in the bottom chamber.
SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and transduction
The SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus that containing expression cassettes for
firefly luciferase instead of the VSV-G open reading frame (LV-Spike-nCoV-Luc) [1] was
purchased from PackGene Biotech (Guangzhou, China). The target cells were grown in
48-well plates until they reached 50%–60% confluence before they were incubated with
pseudotyped virus. At 48 h post-infection, firefly luciferase activities were measured by

using Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according
the manufacturer’s protocol.

Small-interfering RNAs targeting human TRIM28 (NM_005762.2), ACE2 (NM_021804.3)
and IFN-γ receptor 2 (IFNGR2, NM_001329128.1) were synthesized in GenePharma
(Shanghai, China) and transfected into cells by using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX. The
scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control for siRNA transfection. Total RNA was
isolated by using RNAiso reagent. cDNAs were generated by using cDNA synthesis kits
(Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsets of cDNAs were PCR
amplified by using SYBR Green Master Mix. The primer and siRNA sequences were shown
in the Supplementary Table 1. The level of each transcript was quantified by the threshold
cycle method using 18srRNA as an endogenous control.
Western blotting analysis
For protein expression analysis, the total cellular protein was extracted by RIPA lysis buffer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor
cocktail. Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on PVDF membranes. Membranes
were then immunoblotted with the corresponding primary antibodies. The signals were
detected with enhanced chemiluminescence plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)
Statistical analysis
All the experiments were repeated at least 3 times. The values were expressed as mean ±
SEM. Statistical differences were determined to be significant at P<0.05. Unpaired Student's
t-test was used to compare difference between two groups. One-way ANOVA and Tukey
multiple comparison test were used to calculate significant difference between ≥ 3 groups.
Results
Knockdown of TRIM28 increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry via increasing the
expression of ACE2
To study the effects of TRIM28 on ACE2 expression, TRIM28 siRNAs were transfected into
A549 cell, a commonly used cell line model for type II pulmonary epithelial cells expressing
ACE2 [20, 21]. We observed that TRIM28 knockdown strikingly increased the expression of
ACE2 (Figure 1A). TMPRSS2 expression level did not show too much difference between
control and TRIM28 knockdown A549 cells (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, knockdown of another
TRIM family member TRIM27 did not enhance the expression of ACE2 (Figure 1C). We next
employed SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped virus containing the firefly luciferase gene to
evaluate whether TRIM28 controls the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. As shown in the Figure 1D
and 1E, the TRIM28 knockdown cells showed increased luciferase reporter activity,
indicating more virus cell entry. Furthermore, ACE2 siRNAs were shown to reverse the
increased luciferase reporter activity of TRIM28 knockdown cells, suggesting that ACE2
mediates the increased virus cell entry of TRIM28 knockdown cells. Additionally, we have
previously reported the important role of TRIM28 in vascular endothelial cells and smooth
muscle cells [22, 23], however, knockdown of TRIM28 did not significantly alter the

expression of ACE2 in either of these two types of cells, indicating that expression of ACE2 is
regulated by TRIM28 in a cell type-dependent manner (Figure 1F).
Co-culture of NK cells decreases TRIM28 but increases ACE2 expression in A549 cells
The recent discovery that ACE2 is an interferon-stimulated gene in airway epithelial cells has
highlighted the important role of defense system in the regulation of ACE2 expression [5].
NK cells can sense, recognize and respond to viral infected cells and regulate the early onset
of the inflammatory phase [24-26], and they are recently reported to be present in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe COVID-19 [27, 28]; however, the role of
NK cells in the regulation of TRIM28 and ACE2 remains unclear. We next co-cultured A549
cells with NK-92 cells, which is functional activated NK cells, and observed that the
co-culture with NK-92 cells decreased TRIM28 but increased ACE2 expression in A549 cells
(Figure 2A-C). Furthermore, NK-92 cells cultured in the IL-2-free medium failed to alter the
expression of TRIM28 and ACE2 expression of A549 cells (Figure 2D, E). Interestingly, IL-2
itself did not significantly change TRIM28 expression in A549 cells (data not shown). Since
IL-2 maintains the optimal cytotoxic activity of NK cells in culture, our results suggest that
the optimal cytotoxic activity of NK cells is required for the regulation of TRIM28 and ACE2.
To further determine whether the regulatory effect of NK cells on the expression of ACE2 and
TRIM28 of A549 cells is contact-dependent, we co-cultured A549 and NK-92 cells using a
transwell co-culture system. We observed that NK-92 cells showed a similar effect on A549
cells that the expression of TRIM28 was significantly decreased whereas ACE2 expression
was increased in the transwell co-cutlure system (Figure 2F). These data indicated that
paracrine factors from NK cells mediate the regulatory effect of NK cells on the expression of
TRIM28 and ACE2 in A549 cells. NK cells are known to defense against viral infections
through secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, granzyme, GM-CSF and interleukins. We observed that
TNF-α (data not shown) and IFN-γ (Figure 4B) did not affect TRIM28 expression in A549
cells. However, Z-AAD-CMK, a granzyme B inhibitor, can partly reverse the inhibition and
promotion effects of NK-92 cells on TRIM28 and ACE2 expression of A549 cells,
respectively (Figure 2G).
TRIM28 knockdown- and NK cell-induced ACE2 upregulationin in A549 cells is reversed
by dexamethasone
Recent study showed that dexamethasone, a corticosteroid with immunosuppressive and
anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce mortality among COVID-19 patients who received
mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone [29], which prompted us to evaluate whether
dexamethasone can reverse the upregulation of ACE2 and increased pseudotyped
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of TRIM28 knockdown cells. Our results show that dexamethasone
reduced ACE2 levels in both basal and TRIM28 knockdown A549 cells (Figure 3A, B).
Accordingly, pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was blocked by dexamethasone (Figure
3C). Notably, although dexamethasone did not affect the expression of TRIM28 of A549 cells,
it partially reversed the inhibitory effect of NK-92 cell on TRIM28 expression of A549 cells
in the co-culture model (Figure 3D). These data indicate that dexamethasone can reverse the

expression of ACE2 in A549 cells which were induced by TRIM28 knockdown and
co-culture with NK cells.
TRIM28 knockdown potentiates IFN-γ-induced ACE2 expression in A549 cells
Previous studies have reported that TRIM28 acts as a key mediator of IFN [30], it is recently
shown to induce ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells [5]. We then examined whether
TRIM28 affects the IFN-induced upregulation of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. Our results
showed that IFN-γ can up-regulate ACE2 expression in A549 cells (Figure 4A). Importantly,
TRIM28 knockdown dramatically potentiated IFN-γ induced ACE2 expression (Figure 4A,
B), suggesting endogenous TRIM28 negatively modulates IFN-induced ACE2. We previously
observed that TRIM28 can determine expressions of several membrane receptors in vascular
cells [22, 23]. Thus, to further identify the molecular mechanism through which TRIM28
controls IFN signaling pathway, we examined the effect of TRIM28 on the expression of
receptors of INF-γ, including IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. Our results show that TRIM28
knockdown can increase IFNGR2 but not IFNGR1 expression of A549 cells (Figure 4C).
Accordingly, knockdown of TRIM28 strikingly enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT1, the
major downstream signaling components of IFN-γ, at both basal level as well as upon IFN-γ
stimulation (Figure 4D). Furthermore, our results demonstrated that knockdown of IFNGR2
abolished inductive effect of IFN-γ on ACE2 expression in A549 cells, supporting that
INFGR2 is required for IFN-γ to upregulate ACE2 expression (Figure 4E). Taken together,
our results suggest that TRIM28 knockdown can potentiate IFN-γ-induced ACE2 expression
at least partly through a mechanism involving upregulating IFNGR2 expression in A549 cells.
TRIM28 knockdown promotes ACE2 expression in human PAEpiCs
Finally, we validate the effects of TRIM28 on ACE2 expression in human PAEpiCs, a primary
human lung epithelial cell. We observed that ACE2 was more abundantly expressed in
TRIM28 knockdown PAEpiCs, compared to control PAEpiCs (Figure 5A). Consequently,
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was increased in human TRIM28 knockdown PAEpiCs,
which can be reduced by ACE2 siRNA, indicating that TRIM28 knockdown promotes
ACE2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5B). Consistent with our mentioned
results acquired in A549 cells (Figure 2), co-cultured with NK-92 cells also induced greater
mRNA level of ACE2 in PAEpiCs, compare to control (Figure 5C). Considering that TRIM28
expression only slightly decreased whereas ACE2 expression dramatically increased in the
PAEpiCs co-cultured with NK-92 cells, other mechanism regulating ACE2 expression maybe
also exist. Finally, we evaluated the effect of TRIM28 knockdown on AEC2 in human
PAEpiCs in the presence of dexamethasone and IFN-γ. Our results show that knockdown of
TRIM28 still induces ACE2 expression of human PAEpiCs in the presence of dexamethasone.
Meanwhile, knockdown of TRIM28 further enhanced the up-regulation of ACE2 in the
presence of IFN-γ (Figure 5D, E). Furthermore, knockdown of TRIM28 was shown to
increase the expression of IFNGR2 in PAEpiCs at basal level as well as in the presence of
dexamethasone and IFN-γ (Figure 5F). These results support that, in human primary lung
epithelial cells, knockdown of TRIM28 increased ACE2 expression and potentiated the
inductive effect of IFN-γ on ACE2 through a mechanism involving upregulation of IFNGR2.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that TRIM28 knockdown induces ACE2 expression in lung
epithelial cells and increased pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. NK cell-derived factors
inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells. Importantly,
dexamethasone reduced the basal expression of ACE2 and partially reversed TRIM28
knockdown-induced upregulation of ACE2 in A549 cells. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown
enhanced IFN-γ induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating
IFNGR2 in both A549 and primary alveolar epithelial cells. Our study identified TRIM28 as a
key regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and potential drug treatment
targets for COVID-19.
Coronavirus entry is the first step of viral infection. The spike glycoproteins, localized on the
envelope of coronaviruses, bind to their cellular receptors and then lead to the attachment and
fusion between viral and host cell membranes [31-33]. Previous studies elucidated that ACE2
is engaged as SARS-CoV entry receptor. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that one of
receptor-binding domain of the trimeric spike glycoprotein can bind ACE2 and induce pre- to
postfusion conformational transition [31, 34]. Recent studies reported that entry of
SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell is also driven by binding of its spike protein with ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 [1]. In normal human lung, ACE2 is mainly expressed in type II and type I
alveolar epithelial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data showed that ACE2 is
expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells, mainly in type II alveolar epithelial cells [35].
Furthermore, TRIM28 was reported to be co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 among
type II pneumocytes in a scRNA-seq dataset derived from surgical resections of fibrotic lung
tissue [5]. We observed a relative high and low mRNA level for ACE2 in human PAEpiCs and
A549 cells, respectively (data no shown), and showed that TRIM28 knockdown causes an
increase in the expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 entry in both of two type cells. These
data suggest that TRIM28 is a key regulatory factor for expression of ACE2, through which
TRIM28 controls SARS-CoV-2 cell entry in lung epithelial cells
SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the lungs and can activate innate and adaptive immune
responses and cytokine response in alveolar structures. scRNA-seq analysis showed an
existing of myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, mast cells, NK cells, T cells
and B cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-19 [27].
Among these types of cells, NK cells functions to balance the immune responses by
eliminating infected cells and oppressing dendritic cell and T cell activity, which are likely
activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and local cytokines in lung tissue. Moreover, the
scRNA-seq analysis data support that NK cells can traffic into the lung where they contribute
to local tissue injury, although lymphopenia was also observed in patients with severe
COVID-19 [27, 28, 36]. In this study, we demonstrated that co-culture of NK cells with lung
epithelial cells can decrease TRIM28 but increase ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells.
Our data highlight that when the initial virus infected-cells are eliminated by NK cells, the
lung epithelial cells adjacent to NK cells, including virus infected- and non-infected cells, are
more likely to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to enhanced expression of ACE2. Thus,
the virus cell entry and NK cell infiltration can enhance each other, and form a

positive-feedback loop to intensify lung inflammation and infection, suggesting NK cells acts
as a double-edged sword against SARS-CoV-2, and may play a role in exacerbation of lung
inflammation in patients with COVID-19.
Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid compound with potent immunosuppressing
activities, was recently found to reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients by one-third
for patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth for those receiving oxygen [29]. This discovery
has supported the usage of dexamethasone for management of COVID-19. However, the
detail mechanism of how dexamethasone reduces mortality of severe COVID-19 patients is
still unclear. Dexamethasone was shown to inhibit excessive cytokine production and prevent
chemokine storm which damage pulmonary tissue. On the other hands, dexamethasone blocks
naive T cell priming, expansion and differentiation, antibody making of T and B cells and
activationof NK cells [37], and then potentially limit viral clearance. Moreover, patients with
severe COVID-19 present lymphopenia showing that CD4+ T cell , CD8+ T cell, B cell and
NK cell-count were reduced [27, 38]. Since that these immune cells contribute to the
clearance of coronavirus and coronavirus infected cells, the timing of dexamethasone usage
should be considered to avoid further reduction of lymphocytes [39]. In this study, we
demonstrated here that dexamethasone inhibits expression of ACE2 of A549 cells at basal
level as well upon in the presence of TRIM28 siRNA and NK cells, suggesting that decreased
expression ACE2 is involved in the beneficial effect of dexamethasoneon restraining
SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, we observed that dexamethasonedid not significantly alter the
expresion of ACE2 in primary human PAEpiCs, highlighting that distinct strategy should be
implanted for the effective prevention and treatment of the heterogeneous COVID-19
patients.
Previous studies have demonstrated a bidirectional crosstalk between IFNs and TRIM28. For
example, IFN-α mediated immediate-early phase of transcriptional activation in HeLa cells
was negatively regulated by TRIM28 [40]. The SUMOylation deficient TRIM28 can
stimulate and prime IFN-α mediated innate immune defenses and restrict influenza A virus
replication via a JAK1-dependent pathway [41]. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of TRIM28
leads to increased expression level of IFN-β in human lung epithelial cells during infection
with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [42]. Knockdown of TRIM28 in A549 cells
increased Sendai virus–induced IFN-α production and weakened IFN-sensitive vesicular
stomatitis virus infection [30]. Furthermore, TRIM28 can bind with several IFN downstream
effectors, and regulate IFN-dependent immune responses. For example, TRIM28 can bind
with and increase SUMOylation of IRF7 during viral infections [30]. IRF5-mediated
expression of TNF was inhibited by TRIM28 in human M1 macrophages [43]. TRIM28
associates with STAT1 and blocks IFN-induced STAT1-dependent IRF-1 gene expression [40].
The potential contribution of TRIM28 to IFN-γ stimulated ACE2 expression has been
supported by the recent study which showed that TRIM28 is expressed in
ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ type II pneumocytes [5]. We showed herein that TRIM28 knockdown
can enhance expression of IFNGR2 and its downstream target gene, ACE2, in human lung
epithelial cells, providing a new mechanistic link between TRIM28 and IFN-γ.
In summary, this study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by

regulating ACE2 expression in human lung epithelial cells. NK cells activation can inhibit
TRIM28 but promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells. Future studies focusing on the
regulatory mechanism of TRIM28 expression will be of importance to understand the
heterogeneity of COVID-19 patients and develop individualized preventive and therapeutic
strategies. Our results also highlighted the potential distinct effect of dexamethasone on ACE2
expression in different COVID-19 patient groups, which may be further validated by the
ongoing clinical trials of dexamethasone and the future studies.
