Abstract
There is a pressing urgency to understand the entry route of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into the
human body. SARS-CoV-2 viruses enter through ACE2 receptors after the S proteins of the
virus are primed by proteases such as TMPRSS2. Most studies focused on the airway epithelial
and lung alveolar cells as the route of infection, while the mode of transmission through the
ocular route is not well established. Here, we profiled the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors
and receptor-associated enzymes at single-cell resolution of thirty-three human ocular cell
types. We identified unique populations of corneal cells with high ACE2 expression, among
which the conjunctival cells co-expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that they
could serve as the entry points for the virus. Integrative analysis further models the signaling
and transcription regulon networks involved in the infection of distinct corneal cells. Our work
constitutes a unique resource for the development of new treatments and management of
COVID-19.
Introduction
In November 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing
an outbreak of the infectious respiratory disease now known as COVID-19. As of 1 May 2020,
the number of cases worldwide has exceeded 3 million, with over 233,000 deaths. COVID-19
is caused by the virus known as SARS-CoV-2, which utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into host cells [1, 2]. Recently, a study by Wang et al. also
reported Basigin (BSG), also known as CD147, as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into
host cells [3]. The serum protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a key player
in cleaving and activating the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry, although the
cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CTSB/CTSL) are also able to perform such a function
to a smaller extent [1]. By analysing the expression of these genes across multiple tissues, we
can deduce the cell types that could potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2.
Studies analysing the gene and protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across various
tissues and organs have identified the organs at risk during SARS-CoV-2 infection and have
also located specific cell types that may serve as target cells for infection of SARS-CoV-2[4,
5]. These organs include the heart, lungs, kidneys and ileum, while cell types vulnerable to
infection include type II alveolar cells, myocardial cells and ileum epithelial cells. With BSG
as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells along with successful infection of
MT-2 and A3.01 cell lines [6], this risk may extend to T lymphocytes as well which are known

to express BSG on their cell surface. However, the distribution of BSG across the various
tissues and its possible correlation with SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been well documented
yet. Notably, the cornea and conjunctiva were also found to be potential targets for infection
of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a possible role for the eye in COVID-19 [5]. Overall, all these
findings provide a clearer insight into the pathology of COVID-19 and potential novel modes
of transmission.
Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is primarily spread via respiratory droplets produced
by infected individuals and contact routes [7]. However, other modes of transmission are also
emerging as more and more studies report novel routes of viral invasion. One such mode of
transmission is the ocular route, which has been implicated in recent studies and anecdotal
reports [8-10]. Earlier studies also indicate that SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARSCoV-2 [11], is able to enter the body via indirect or direct contact with mucosal membranes in
the eyes, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may also have the ability to gain entry via the ocular
tissues [12, 13]. Recently, a study by Hui et al. observed that SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect
conjunctival cells ex vivo and undergo productive replication, implying that the ocular route
may emerge as a significant mode of transmission of COVID-19. [14].
Although the receptors used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect ocular cells have not been characterised,
previous studies have pointed to possible roles for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2
entry in ocular cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from
tissues including those of the cornea, retina, brain and heart showed that tissues in the cornea
also express ACE2 and that superficial conjunctival cells were found to co-express ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 [5] to a relatively high extent. In a separate study, immunolocalization of BSG in
the human eye revealed BSG expression in certain ocular tissues including those of the corneal
and conjunctival epithelium [15], indicating that BSG could also serve as a receptor for SARSCoV-2 entry into certain ocular cells. It is also reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be present in
ocular fluids and cause inflammation of the conjunctiva [16, 17]. Viral entry via the ocular
route could result in subsequent manifestation of respiratory disease via the nasolacrimal
system [12]. However, it remains unclear whether this route is a major mode of transmission
of COVID-19 and which receptors are used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect ocular cells. Thus, more
detailed characterisation of the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infects ocular cells is
urgently needed.

In this study, we use scRNA-seq datasets to analyse the expression of ACE2 and other SARSCoV-2 entry genes, including BSG, TMPRSS2, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L, in ocular tissues
to determine the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infects ocular cells. Should the ocular
route prove to be a significant mechanism of transmission, these findings will have implications
for designing or selecting vaccines and antivirals that effectively block the ocular route as well.
Results
Identification of ACE2+ cells in Human Ocular Landscape
We prepared a single-cell atlas of different cell types from tissues of the human eye (Fig 1a).
A high-resolution transcriptional landscape of 33,445 single-cells was mapped (Gautam and
Hamashima et. al, manuscript under preparation). Following that, we inspected gene expression
across tissues and thirty-three cell types in the human eye, discovering that ACE2 expression
remains almost exclusive to a small percentage of cells in the cornea. In addition, within the
cornea, at-least 6% of cells have high ACE2 gene expression compared to the rest of the ocular
tissues (Fig 1c). We observed that conjunctival cells co-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 which
was also reported by Sungnak et al. [4]. Ocular epithelial cells also showed ACE2 expression,
although that of TMPRSS2 was not detected. However, epithelial cells expressed genes coding
for the cysteine proteases CTSB and CTSL (Fig 1c) which are also able to prime the SARSCoV-2 S1 protein, suggesting they may still be vulnerable to viral infection despite having no
observable TMPRSS2 expression. Besides ACE2, we analysed the expression of BSG
(CD147) among the human eye cell types as it could be another receptor/co-receptor for SARSCOV-2 entry into host cells [9]. However, with BSG we did not observe any specificity in cell
types. We also checked for expression of receptors or entry-related enzymes specific for other
viruses such as the coronaviruses HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV along with influenza viruses.
Besides influenza viruses, we could not find the expression of entry-associated genes specific
to other viruses. This is consistent with previous reports that MERS-CoV infection does not
show any ocular complications [10]. The presence of influenza receptors in the cornea is
consistent with reports that this tissue is involved in subsequent manifestation of respiratory
disease via the nasolacrimal route [5].
ACE2 correlation analysis reveals its partner genes in cornea
To elucidate the pathways that are activated after ACE2 binding with the SARS-CoV-2 S1
protein, we sought to understand the transcriptomic differences between ACE2+ cells and the
rest of the cells in the cornea. Therefore, we searched for genes that have high correlation with

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and listed some of the top genes (Fig 2a). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis
of this list showed that terms related to cell membrane dynamics are enriched in such cell types
(Fig 2b). The significant GO terms were related to/involved in cadherin binding, cell-cell
junction, membrane edge, golgi complex, endosomal complex. We zoomed into a few genes
that contributed to the GO terms (Fig 2c,d,e). Firstly, cadherin binding genes were mostly
upregulated in ACE2+ cells (Fig 2c), which was consistent with reports from analysis of the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients [19]. Among these genes, the ATPdependent RNA helicase DDX3X is predicted to be able to bind to the S protein of SARSCoV-2[20] and CD46 is a receptor for the measles virus [21]. MICAL2 is found to be one of
the regulators of influenza virus infection [22]. MLLT4 is one of the components which links
nectins with F-actins in cellular connections. Previous studies have shown that several viruses
utilize nectins in cellular junctions for transmission [23]. Therefore, from our analysis, it is
evident that ACE2+ cells have many genes which may aid SARS-CoV-2 in infection and its
replication cycle. Similarly, it is logical that endosomal/Golgi transport is upregulated in
ACE2+ cells as coronavirus entry is mediated through the endo/lysosomal pathway in a
proteolysis-dependent manner [24].
Out of the highly correlated genes, SOX13 and PBX1 are the transcription factors that are
active in ACE2+ cells. SOX13 is an islet cell autoantigen present in type I diabetic patients
[25] and a lineage specification transcriptional factor for γδ T cells which produce IL17 [26].
We checked the co-expression of SOX13 with STAT1 as STAT1 expression is highly
correlated with ACE2 in COVID-19 patients and it acts upstream of ACE2 [27]. Subsequent
MAGIC imputation revealed that cells that have high co-expression of SOX13 and STAT1 also
have high expression of ACE2 (Fig 2g). Therefore, we wanted to identify genes that are
downstream of SOX13 to elucidate a possible mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection of ocular
cells following entry via ACE2. Transcription factors were identified by SCENIC analysis and
their gene expression was checked across relevant ocular cell types (Fig 2f). We discovered
that SOX13 expression is high in conjunctival cells, and some of the target genes of SOX13
(PLSCR2, PRDM1, ATP10B, DHRS9, THRB, and C10orf55) follow the same trend (Fig 2f).
Genes like PLSCR2 have a role in fine tuning interferon expression after viral infection [28].
Additionally, PRDM1 directly targets STAT1 and affects interferon signalling pathways [29].
This shows that SOX13 may be one of the important transcription factors involved in SARSCoV-2 infection of ACE2+ cells in the eye.

Analysis of corneal signaling pathway after viral infection
The expression of interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) in conjunctival and endothelial
cells of cornea implies some sort of interaction between these cell types (Fig 2h). During
SARS-CoV infection, the virus inhibits the expression of IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors
which are required for interferon induction [30]. DDX3X is known to be an interferon promoter
[31] while RIOK3 is an adaptor protein required for IRF3 mediated interferon production [32].
We checked the expression of such proteins in all cell types of cornea and found out that
DDX3X and RIOK3 are upregulated in conjunctival cells. Therefore, we checked for possible
crosstalk occurring between endothelial cells and conjunctival cells, using NicheNet to find
any significant ligand-receptor interactions between these two cell types (Fig 2i). Interestingly,
we found IL6 gene expression to be high in corneal endothelial cells while ILF6R receptors
were present in most of the conjunctival cells. It is established that IL6, along with other proinflammatory cytokines, are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients and mostly seen in
severe patients compared to non-severe patients [17]. We then proceeded to identify the genes
that are activated by IL6 in conjunctival cells in the cornea.
By checking the expression of interferon regulators and receptors, we modelled the infection
of conjunctival cells by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and crosstalk between conjunctival and
endothelial cells. Following viral infection, interferon regulators are activated. Basal gene
expression of these interferon regulators (IRF7, IRF3, DDX3, and RIOK3) in non-infected
corneal cells shows that they have high expression in conjunctival cells. After infection,
interferons released by infected cell types might communicate with endothelial cell types which
have high expression of interferon receptors like IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (Fig 2h). Interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) such as STAT2 and IRF9 also show high expression in endothelial
cells (Fig 2h). These factors likely stimulate the release of cytokines such as IL6 from
endothelial cells, as shown by how IL6 expression was observed to be high in endothelial cells
(Fig 2h). Further Nichenet analysis showed the genes downstream of IL6R and discovered
STAT3, NFKB1, NFKBIZ, SRC, PTPN11, TF, SAA2, and LIF that had high regulatory
potential (Fig 2h). These genes were also highly expressed in conjunctival cells (Fig 2h). IL6
has been shown to activate STAT3 transcription factors and the NF-KB pathway [33] while
ACE2 has been shown to reduce the expression of STAT3 during lung inflammation [34].
Hence, there seems to be a tight balance between ACE2 and STAT3 expression. IL6 also
enhances the uptake of transferrin in hepatocytes [35] and transferrin has been used by viruses
to gain entry into host cells [36].

Using Nichenet data, we constructed a network depicting the genes that are activated by IL6
signalling in conjunctival cells and visualised this network using Cytoscape. Therefore, we
present a model for conjunctival cells communication with endothelial cell types and reveal
potential pathways for virus infection and response in ocular cell types. We propose that after
infection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, interferons produced by conjunctival cells and those
interferons bind to interferon receptors in endothelial cells. In endothelial cells, interferon
stimulated genes like IRF9 induce expression of IL6. IL6 then binds to IL6R receptors and
induces the activation of the STAT3 based interferon pathway.
Discussion
Using a single cell atlas of the human eye, we discovered that unique populations of cornea
cells ACE2 expression. Further analysis revealed that these cells were mostly epithelial cell
types present in the corneal and conjunctival cells. Conjunctival cells also showed expression
of TMPRSS2 along with ACE2, suggesting that conjunctival sacs could be the entry point for
SARS-COV-2 viruses. However, CTSB and CTSL were also expressed in ACE2+ corneal
epithelial cell types indicating that SARS-CoV-2 could also infect certain population of
epithelial cells in the cornea. While probing the genes that were highly co-expressed with
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we found SOX13 to be one of the interesting gene candidates. SOX13
is a transcriptional factor that affects the lineage specification of T cells and is also an
autoantigen in Type 1 diabetes patients. The target genes of SOX13 such as PRDM1 and
PLSCR2 affect interferon signalling pathways. Besides that, SOX13 also showed high
coexpression with STAT1, which is one of the top predictors of ACE2 expression. This shows
that SOX13 could be a viable drug target for modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. While
examining the microenvironment of corneal cell types, we detected high expression of IL6 in
endothelial cell types. IL6 is one of the cytokines that is highly expressed in severe COVID-19
patients. This helped us to study the IL6 pathway in conjunctival cell types in the cornea. Using
Nichenet analysis, we were able to find downstream genes of IL6 pathway and then construct
a network for IL6 signalling in conjunctival cell types. With that we constructed a model of
how conjunctival cells could be infected by viruses and their subsequent communication with
endothelial cells. The endothelial cells release IL6 and bind to IL6R receptors in conjunctival
cells. Together, that allowed us to determine the pathways that are potentially activated in
response to IL6.

Materials and methods
Single-cell RNA-seq data processing and visualization
Single-cell RNA-seq of primary tissues in the human eye, followed by the generating highresolution transcriptomic atlas was performed in our previous studies (Gautam and Hamashima
et al., manuscript in preparation). Briefly, tissues (cornea, iris, ciliary body, neural retina,
retinal pigmented epithelium, and choroid) from four individual post-mortem human adult eyes
were dissociated by trypsin treatment. After freezing the cells, 10X Genomics single-cell RNAseq was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Alignment to the reference
genome, quantification, initial quality control (QC) and the downstream analyses were mainly
performed using the 10X Genomics ‘cellranger’ pipeline (version 2.1.1 or 3.0.2) [37] and the
R package ‘Seurat’ (version >3.0.1) [38] (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat). Total 33 cell
classes were manually annotated based on the cluster-specific markers. The clustering result
was visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). The generated
Seurat object was exported and used in the present study. The expression profile of the selected
genes was plotted on the bubble plot with the ‘DotPlot’ function in Seurat or violin plot with
‘geom_violin’ function in ggplot2 with the slight modification.
Co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2

(https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/MAGIC) imputation. MAGIC could restore missing
values in the large sparse count matrix of single-cell RNA-seq. UMI count matrix of all 3,736
corneal cells was used for this analysis. We defined a gene with >0.5 Pearson as a co-expressing
gene with ACE2. Due to the low TMPRSS2 expression, the co-expression of TMRPSS2 was
analyzed as follows. First, individual cells were ordered by the imputed expression value for
each gene and the population of cells in the top 10 percentile was extracted, gene by gene.
Then, for each subset of cells, the number of cells expressing TMPRSS2 was counted. We
defined that when >=10 cells express TMPRSS2 in each subset, the gene is co-expressed with
TMPRSS2 based on our prior analysis. The gene-set co-expressing with both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 was used in the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) by Metascape [40]
(http://metascape.org). Identification of SOX13 downstream targets was performed using
SCENIC [41] (https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC) with default parameters. SCENIC is a
powerful software which reconstructs a single-cell regulatory network based on the co-

expression patterning between transcription factors (TFs) and potential target genes and the
enrichment of the regulator’s binding motif.
Cell-cell communication analysis
‘NicheNet’ [42] (https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr) was used to predict interaction
molecules in the IL-6 downstream signaling in cornea. Among 3,736 corneal cells, 30 corneal
endothelial cells and 159 conjunctival cells were selected as sender and receiver cells,
respectively, in the analysis. Genes expressed in more than 5 % within each cell-type were
retained. The gene-set having immune-associated GO terms (GO:0002376, immune system
process or GO:0002526, acute inflammatory response) was set as target genes of interest. The
‘predict_ligand_activities’ function in the R package ‘nichenetr’ was run with default
parameters. Predicted top 5 active ligand-receptor pairs were retained as highly potential
interactions and top 3 potential targets of IL-6 signaling were featured in the figure. Based on
the exported NicheNet data, the network graph was created using Cytoscape [43] (version
3.7.1) with a Compound Spring Embedder layout. The proposed pathway of virus transmission
via the route from the human eye was illustrated using BioRender (https://biorender.com).
Data availability
Single-cell RNA-seq data (human primary eyes) have been deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) under the accession code GSE147979, which will be released after publishing
our previous studies (Gautam and Hamashima et al., manuscript in preparation).
Code availability
All of the codes used in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable
request. Unless mentioned otherwise, all of the plots were generated using the R package
‘ggplot2’.
