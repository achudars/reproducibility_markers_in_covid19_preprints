Abstract

23

In late 2019, an outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an emerging

24

coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in high morbidity and mortality in infected humans1.

25

Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-

26

2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of

27

vaccines and antivirals2. Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified

28

in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian

29

hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was

30

independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more

31

pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral

32

RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages.

33

Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching

34

earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed

35

conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast,

36

we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters. We

37

propose that comparative assessment in young versus aged hamsters of SARS-CoV-2

38

vaccines and treatments may yield valuable information as this small-animal model

39

appears to mirror age-dependent differences in human patients.

Main Text

42

Emerging coronaviruses4 have caused serious global public health concerns in the past

43

two decades and cause infections that lead to severe respiratory and partly systemic

44

disease. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV as well as Middle

45

East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, both of which resulted in high morbidity and

46

mortality in infected humans5. Similar to other emerging CoV, the novel SARS-CoV-2 likely

47

arose from an ancestor in bats and amplified in an as yet unknown animal reservoir before

48

making its jump into the human population6. SARS-CoV-2 has pushed global health

49

systems to the brink of breakdown. The remarkably fast and unexpected spread of SARS-

50

CoV-2 can be attributed to efficient replication in the upper respiratory tract and robust

51

human-to-human transmission, a characteristic that clearly distinguishes SARS-CoV-2

52

from SARS- and MERS-CoV. While COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory syndrome, it can

53

induce quite variable clinical signs. It has become evident that differences in type and

54

severity of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease seems to be correlated with the age of patients

55

and is exacerbated by pre-existing conditions4,7.

56

The availability of reliable animal models is of critical importance for pathogenesis studies

57

as well as the development and preclinical evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics. For

58

SARS-CoV-2, the susceptibility of several animal species was predicted by in silico

59

analysis based on comparisons of the entry receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

60

human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). More specifically, the interaction of

61

the viral spike (S) glycoprotein receptor binding domain with its hACE2 counterpart was

62

examined8,9, and in some cases examined in vivo10. Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection

63

was shown in non-human primates, which developed respiratory disease recapitulating

64

moderate disease as observed in humans11-14. Mice are not naturally susceptible to SARS-

65

CoV-2, but mouse-adapted virus strains have been developed and used in BALB/c

66

mice15,16. Moreover, transgenic mice expressing hACE2 represent a lethal SARS-CoV-2

67

infection model resulting in significant weight loss and permitting robust virus replication

68

in the respiratory tract including the lungs17. Ferrets have provided valuable data in the

69

case of SARS-CoV18,19, and two studies describe the infection of ferrets with SARS-CoV-

70

2 and successful transmission to in-contact animals without clinical signs20,21.

71

First and preliminary studies also focused on the assessment of a Syrian hamster model

72

that had previously been used successfully in SARS and MERS research18,19,22,23. It was

73

suggested that hamsters are highly susceptible although they were reported to show no

74

or only moderate respiratory signs and body weight losses. It is important to note,

75

however, that only young male hamsters of 4 to 5 weeks of age were used in these

76

studies24,25.

77

We sought to explore age-related differences in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

78

Syrian hamsters, and to establish a small-animal model that resembles the more severe

79

SARS-CoV-2-infection observed particularly in elderly patients. For our experiments, we

80

used a total of 36 female and male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), which were

81

either 6- (n=24) or 32- to 34-week-old (n=12). Hamsters were kept in individually ventilated

82

cages (IVCs), and randomly assigned to three groups: mock (n=12, 6-week-old), young

83

infected (n=12, 6-week-old) and aged infected (n=12, 32- to 34-week-old). Animals were

84

mock-infected with supernatants of cell culture medium taken from uninfected Vero E6

85

cells or infected with 1x105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 München (SARS-CoV-

86

2M;

87

temperatures, body weights and clinical signs were recorded daily. Animals were

88

euthanized and sampled at different time points after infection to assess virus titers in

89

various organs and to examine pathological changes in the lungs (Fig. 1 and 2).

102

First, we observed age-dependent SARS-CoV-2-induced body weight losses, with more

103

pronounced weight reductions in aged compared to young hamsters (Fig. 1A-C). Mean

104

body weight losses peaked at 6 to 7 days post-infection (dpi), with partial recovery until 14

105

dpi in both infected groups. There were no differences in body temperatures between the

106

infected groups or between infected and mock-infected animals (Fig. 1D).

107

Next, we determined viral titers and SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers in various tissues

108

by RT-qPCR27,28, and performed virus titrations from lung homogenates using Vero E6

109

cells (Fig. 1E-H). Results were similar between age groups and confirmed high viral loads

110

in respiratory samples at early time points after infection, but relatively rapid clearance of

111

infection. It seems important to note that RT-qPCR of blood samples revealed viremia in

112

two male individuals from both age groups with viral RNA copy numbers of >105 at 5 and

113

7 dpi, respectively (Fig. 1I). In these individuals, we also detected relatively high levels of

114

viral RNA in the spleen, kidneys and duodenum indicating systemic spread of SARS-CoV-

115

2 in some cases (Table S1). To further investigate potential dissemination of infection, we

116

tested the aforementioned organs from all animals sacrificed at 5 dpi and found them to

117

be either negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or to contain only low levels of viral RNA (Tab.

118

S1).

119

Viral loads in bucco-laryngeal swabs and nasal washes appeared to be a reliable

120

surrogate of viral loads in the lungs in both age groups, as the average loads ranged

121

between 104 and 107 copies, respectively, at early times after infection, indicating that

122

these sampling techniques can be used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication in Syrian

123

hamsters (Fig. 1G-H).

124

At 14 dpi, hamsters had mounted a robust humoral immune response as evidenced by

125

relatively high titers of neutralizing antibodies. It is worth noting that antibody titers were

126

higher in young when compared to aged hamsters (Table S1).

127

Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching

128

an earlier and stronger immune cell influx into the lungs associated with a faster recovery

129

than their aged counterparts (Fig. 2A-E). At 2 dpi, young hamsters developed a marked

130

necro-suppurative bronchointerstitial pneumonia with strong alveolar and interstitial influx

131

of neutrophils and macrophages as well as perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, which was

132

much milder or absent in the aged group (Fig. S1A, right panel). In contrast, only aged

133

animals developed pronounced alveolar and perivascular edema indicating vascular

134

leakage at 3 dpi (Fig. S2C). A more diffuse, severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia was

135

similarly present in both groups at 5 dpi with onset of tissue regeneration, including

136

hyperplasia of bronchial epithelium (Fig. S1C, arrowhead) and type II alveolar epithelial

137

cells.

138

Only at that time point, the arterial and venous endothelium of animals in both groups was

139

swollen and vacuolated, with necrotic endothelial cells separated from the underlying

140

basement membrane by the presence of subendothelial lymphocytes and neutrophils (Fig.

141

S2C, left), consistent with what has been described as endothelialitis in human SARS-

142

CoV-2 infection29. At 7 dpi, recovery as indicated by marked hyperplasia of bronchial

143

epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells were seen in both groups (Fig. S2A).

144

Interestingly, lung tissues had almost recovered in young hamsters at day 14, while the

145

aged animals still had persistent tissue damage and active inflammation (Fig. S2B).

146

From 2 dpi onwards, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by in situ hybridization in bronchial

147

epithelial cells, debris in the bronchial lumen, alveolar epithelial cells type I and type II as

148

well as macrophages in both groups, again with clear age-dependent differences over

149

time (Fig. 2F). Young animals had high amounts of viral RNA in numerous bronchial

150

epithelial cells and within the bronchial lumen that was accompanied by marked spreading

151

through the lung parenchyma on 2 and 3 dpi. In contrast, aged animals, had less virus

RNA present in the bronchi. We detected only a scattered pattern of infected bronchial

166

epithelial cells and sporadic areas of parenchymal infection at 2 and 3 dpi. At 5 dpi, viral

167

RNA was undetectable in the bronchi of young hamsters, and only small infected areas

168

containing low levels of RNA with a patchy distribution were detected. It is noteworthy that

169

aged animals, at the same time after infection, had increased numbers of infected areas

170

with a similarly patchy distribution throughout the lungs as well as copious amounts of viral

171

RNA associated with cellular debris in the bronchial lumen. Using this technique, no viral

172

RNA was detected at 14 dpi in either group.

173

In summary, our study examined the suitability of a small animal model to study SARS-

174

CoV-2 infections. Intranasal infection of Syrian hamsters resulted in weight loss and robust

175

virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract. We further demonstrate that aged

176

32- to 34-week-old hamsters experienced higher and more consistent weight loss after

177

intranasal infection, while body temperatures and virus replication in upper airways and

178

lungs were similar between both age groups. Furthermore, we show that, using in situ

179

hybridization, viral RNA was detectable in bronchial epithelial cells, type I and type II

180

alveolar epithelial cells, and macrophages. All these cell types are potential targets of

181

SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue; hence, infection of hamsters of different ages seems

182

to closely reflect what has been reported for human patients25,30. In contrast to SARS-

183

CoV-2 titers, histopathological changes differed markedly between young and aged Syrian

184

hamsters over time: younger animals launched more severe reactions at early time points

185

after infection, while lesions and inflammation in the lungs became more pronounced and

186

widespread at later time points in the elderly.

187

Based on the data presented here, we propose that comparative preclinical assessments

188

of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and other treatment options in young versus aged hamsters may

189

yield valuable and relevant results as this small animal model appears to mimic age-

190

dependent differences in humans. The development of a substantial humoral immune

191

response emphasizes that hamsters are likely suitable for vaccination trials. Our

192

observations also confirm that body weight loss appears to be the only robust clinical

193

parameter in SARS-CoV-2 infection of Syrian hamsters. This makes the difference in body

194

weight loss between age groups with more consistent losses in aged hamsters only more

195

important as it provides an objective way to judge clinical efficacy of antiviral therapy or

196

vaccination.
