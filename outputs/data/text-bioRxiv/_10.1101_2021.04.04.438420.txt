Abstract:

Various reports of decreased analytical sensitivities of real-time PCR-based detection of Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been associated with occurrence of mutations in the target area of
primer/probe binding. Knowledge about propensities of different genes to undergo mutation can inform
researchers to select optimal genes to target for the qPCR design. We analyzed supplementary data
from over 45 thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes provided by Mercatelli et al to calculate the unique and
prevalent mutations in different genes of SARS-CoV-2. We found that non-structural proteins in the
ORF1ab region were more conserved compared to structural genes. Further factors which need to be
relied upon for proper selection of genes for qPCR design are discussed.

Introduction:
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has proved to be an important technology to give high
sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis since early day of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1.
In the initial days, clinical diagnosis was relied up on, in addition to, less specific ComputerTomography (CT) scans 2. Coronaviruses, and Nidovirales order in general, have the largest RNA
genomes of all RNA viruses and due to high fidelity RNA replication and transcription machineries, the
number of new mutations occurring per replication is very low 3. According to Worldometers.info,
more than 1.6 billion tests have been carried world-wide for 7.8 billion world population by end of
February 2021 4. Due to resource constraints, kits that detect only one to two genes have also come to
use 5, and this may increase the chance of false negative results in case qPCR fails to detect one or

two genes due to some reasons. Studies have reported a lack of sensitivity for the Real-Time Reverse
Transcriptase (RT)-PCR test used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 6,7. Although test sensitivity could be
lowered by errors in methodology, instrument, and diagnostic kit, a decrease in PCR efficacy due to
mutation in the primer or probe binding sites is very hard to account for 8.
Mercatelli et al have analyzed over 48 thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes, obtained from the GISAID
database, deposited from the beginning to June 26, 2020 and found over 350 thousand mutations in the
viral genomes 9. Effect of mutations on qPCR sensitivities has been exemplified in a previous

influenza pandemic 10. The impact of mutations on PCR sensitivity carried at community or country-

level depends upon two factors: first, the relative propensities of the target gene areas to undergo
mutation, and second, on the prevalence of such mutated clades/strains in the population. The first
scenario is described as unique mutations and the second by all or prevalent mutations in this article.
We designed this study to identify genes which had lesser mutability and could be used as reliable
target sites for PCR.
Results and Discussion:
Based on number of unique SNPs per nucleotide, we found that NSP10 was the most conserved region
(Figure 1). 3’ UTR and 5’ UTR were the least conserved regions with a high tendency to undergo
mutation than the others. Similar results were seen when the prevalence of total (non-unique or
prevalent) SNPs were compared among different genomic regions with NSP10 being the most
conserved and 5’ UTR being the least. In general, non-structural proteins were more conserved
compared to structural ones (Table 1). During the multiplication process of the viruses, the whole plusstranded genomic RNAs are manufactured from minus-strand templates by a single type of replication

machinery 3, and thus the non-structural genes (open reading frame 1ab) and the non-structural genes
(in the 3’ end of the coronavirus genome) should have similar mutation rates. While there could be
different factors involved in this phenomenon, one of them could be evolutionary pressure for
structural proteins to evolve. Structural proteins are exposed to antibodies in the respiratory mucosa or
blood during infection and transmission from one cell to another. The non-structural proteins help in
the intracellular physiology, particularly related to replication and transcription, and thus are unexposed
to antibody containing fluids. Thus the structural proteins need to evolve to evade antibody-based
suppression 11 of infection to new cells.

Transcriptomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has repeatedly shown a higher prevalence of reads from the 3’
subgenomic RNAs in the infected cells 12. While this could be due to higher concentration of the subgenomic RNAs located in the 3’ end, it was also reasoned that the methodological bias due to
sequencing from the 3’ end of the genome might have impacted on the viral sequence reads 12.
Sawicki et al have iterated that the cellular concentration of plus-stranded RNAs, which are synthesized
by using minus-strand as a template, is 50-100 fold higher than the minus-stranded RNA for
coronaviruses 13. The so called “nested sub-genomic structures” are formed during coronaviral
transcription process. This means, whenever a gene, 3’ to the ORF genes, is transcribed for its
translation, all other genes in 3’ direction to that particular gene are redundantly transcribed too.
Considering that concentration of each of the plus-stranded translatable sub-genomic RNA units are 50100 times more their corresponding minus-strands, this results in higher number of sequence reads for
genes as we go towards the 3' end of the genome causing the highest number of reads for N gene RNA
followed by M, E and S 12. This could be the reason why the Ct values for structural genes N and E

have better readings (lower Ct values) than that of the RdRp genes 14,15. Thus, the 3’ end sub-genomic

RNAs for the structural proteins, which are present at higher concentration in the clinical samples, can
be better regions for primer/probe design in terms of better analytical sensitivity.

Among the genes used by WHO collaborating laboratories, Corman et al (Charite, Gerrmany) used E
gene and RdRp genes for the diagnosis of COVID-19 while other labs used N and/or ORF1 genes 8.
Commercially, the S gene has also been used 5. “ORF1ab” has been frequently stated to be used for

COVID-19 detection in the commercial PCR kits, but it is not clear if it is the RdRp gene (NSP12).

Different regions within specific genes may have different propensities to mutate depending on the
exposure of different motifs to the antibody environment. We analyzed the mutation patterns (prevalent
and unique) along 5’ to 3’ direction for major genes used in qPCR diagnosis (N, E, S and RdRp)
(Figure 2). One can eyeball the mutation pattern along the length of the genes to select appropriate
regions of each genes for primer/probe design. One should be careful to interpret that the shown
mutation pattern in Figure 2 represent more than 45 thousand viral genomes and thus, any one clinical
sample is highly unlikely to contain all the mutations. We would recommend low mutating structural
genes to be used for diagnosis. Recently, the S-gene target failure in UK variant of concern strains
tested by Applied Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit was found to be due to 6-nucleotide
deletion mutation in Spike gene region targeted by the kit 16. Including only one gene such as this in

qPCR diagnostic kit could have interpreted the clinical sample as negative. Thus kits with multiple
targets are advisable. As the product sizes of individual genes in multiplex real-time PCR are
maintained to be of equal or near equal and shorter lengths (100-200 bp) and of equivalent GC contents
in addition to other factors 17, wise selection of regions with lower SNP loads should be carried to
design reliable primers and probes.

Materials and Methods:
Based on supplementary material provided by Mercatelli et al., we calculated the relative number of
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per nucleotide in different genomic regions 9. While the
data provided by Mercatelli et al. only included mutations until June of 2020, this analysis can help to
understand the general trend of genes to mutate and give an idea about their relative mutability which is
the objective of this study. Unique mutation events were determined, based on “refpos”, “refvar” and
“qvar” columns in the excel, by removing the entries with duplicate SNP variants but retaining the SNP
entries where the same nucleotide may have undergone different kind of mutations. To accurately
quantify mutations in the 3’ UTR region, entries for sequences corresponding to 3’ UTR at or before
nucleotide 29,674th, the last nucleotide for ORF10, were removed as the sequence only 3' to ORF10
was included as true 3' UTR. Intergenic SNPs, which were 3 in total, were also removed. We
combined entries for NSP12a and NSP12b into NSP12 which corresponds to the RdRp gene. Number
of mutations or SNPs, unique or all, per nucleotide per million genomes for each of the SARS-CoV-2
genes were calculated by dividing the number of SNPs in a given gene by product of nucleotide size of
that given gene and number of genomes analyzed by Mercatelli et al. (48,635 genomes analyzed), and
then multiplying 1 million. Figures were drawn in GraphPad Prism v5 or WPS excel. Gene coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (NCBI accession ID NC_045512.2) was used as
reference.
