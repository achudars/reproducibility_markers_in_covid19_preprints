Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with
high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and
understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as
SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences
between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2
virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated
hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to
adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus
to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results
in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose
of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of
vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility
to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.

Main text introduction
A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in
December 2019 (4), and has rapidly spread throughout the world. The virus likely originated in bats (5, 6),
before potentially jumping to an intermediate host and then to humans. From December 2019 to July 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 10 million infections and 500,000 deaths worldwide. The virus can cause
asymptomatic, mild, or severe respiratory infection in different individuals – and can transmit from
asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, making containment with public health measures very
difficult. The disease caused by the virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Mild
cases of COVID-19 are characterized by fever, cough, and fatigue, while severe cases involve bilateral
interstitial pneumonia, and cardiac and clotting complications (7-10). No specific vaccines are currently
available (11). Recently, the antiviral remdesivir has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients,
but its efficacy and supply is limited (12, 13). However, an unprecedented response from the research
community has resulted in numerous therapeutics and vaccine candidates being investigated both preclinically (14-18) and clinically, with several clinical trials now underway (19, 20).

SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV-1, which also emerged via interspecies transmission in 2003
(21). Both viruses bind to host cells via the interaction of the viral spike (S) protein with human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (2, 3, 22-24). A number of amino acid changes in SARS-CoV-2 S increase
the affinity of binding to hACE2 (25). Species-specific differences in ACE2 are a critical determinant for S
protein binding and high-titer viral replication in animal models. The mouse ortholog of ACE2 is incompatible
with S, therefore typical inbred mouse strains do not support viral replication. This is a major challenge, as
a large amount of pre-clinical vaccine, anti-viral, and therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) testing is
usually initially performed in mice, due to the availability of reagents for immunology studies, and the
breadth of genetic and transgenic mouse models. Overcoming this limitation requires either mouse
adaptation of the virus, or heterologous expression of hACE2 in mice. A mouse-adapted strain of SARSCoV-2 containing 2 amino acid changes in S has recently been described, which results in viral replication
in the lungs of mice, and signs of pulmonary damage, but no lethality (26). Alternatively, a number of mouse
models for hACE2 expression have been developed including transgenic and knock-in strains, as well as
viral vector-mediated delivery of hACE2. Transgenic models include hACE2 expression under the control
of the human cytokeratin (K18) epithelial cell promoter (27), the synthetic CAG composite promoter driving
high levels of expression in eukaryotic cells (28), human ACE2 promoter (29), or hepatocyte nuclear factor
3/forkhead homologue 4 (HFH4) ciliated epithelial cell promoter (30). A recent report has also described a
hACE2 knock-in mouse model (31). Tissue and cellular expression of hACE2 vary in these models leading
to differing levels of viral replication in different organs and cell types, and differences in disease
pathogenesis. Other models use viral vector-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the lung including adenoassociated virus (AAV) (32) and adenovirus (15, 33). Importantly, a number of these models including K18,
CAG, HFH4, and knock-in mice show neuroinvasion and high titer replication in the brain, which likely drives
lethality. Although neurological complications have been described in human COVID-19 patients (34), lung
damage is the primary cause of death in most patients (35). It is evident that there is an urgent need to
establish animal models which authentically recapitulate human lung disease which will be important for
understanding disease pathogenesis. However, models in which hACE2 is over-expressed are useful for
early vaccine and antiviral studies which use protection from infection or viral replication as an endpoint.
Therefore, in this study, we compared viral replication and morbidity in the K18 transgenic hACE2 model
head-to-head with adenovirus (Ad)-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the lung.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Hemizygous 6-week old female K18-hACE2 mice on the C57BL/6J background (Jax strain 034860), were
compared to age and sex-matched wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J (Jax strain 000664) and WT BALB/cJ (Jax
strain 000651) mice. Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). Mice were housed in a BSL-2 facility for
intranasal instillation of non-replicating adenoviral (Ad) vectors before being transferred to a BSL-3 facility
at ISMMS for challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in
individually ventilated cages and fed irradiated food and filtered water.
Cell lines and culture media
T-REx™-293 cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were maintained in high glucose (4500mg/L)
Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100
μg/mL streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Vero-E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™, clone E6)
were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and penicillin-streptomycin. A549 (ATCC® CCL-185™) cells were cultured
in Kaighn's Modification of Ham's F-12 (F-12K) containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin, as above.
Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Viruses
Cells and mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI resources; NR-52281) under
BSL-3 containment in accordance to the biosafety protocols developed by the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai. Viral stocks were grown in Vero-E6 cells in the above media containing 2% FBS for 72 h and
were validated by genome sequencing. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1; mice
were infected with 1x104 plaque forming units (PFU). Viral seed stocks for non-replicating E1/E3 deleted
viral vectors based on human adenovirus type-5 (HAdV-C5, referred to as Ad throughout) without an

antigen (Ad-Empty), or expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ad-ACE2) receptor under
the control of a CMV promoter, were obtained from Iowa Viral Vector Core Facility. Viral stocks were
amplified to high titers following infection of T-Rex™-293 cells and purification using two sequential rounds
of cesium chloride (CsCl) ultracentrifugation, as described previously (36, 37). Infectious titer was
determined using a tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50) end-point dilution assay, and physical particle
titer quantified by micro-bicinchoninic acid (microBCA) protein assay, both described previously (36).
Flow cytometry and SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay
A549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1x105 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. The following
day, cells were washed with PBS and transduced with Ad5-Empty or Ad5-hACE2 in triplicate at a MOI of
100 in serum-free Hams F-12K for 3h at 37°C. Control wells were incubated with serum-free Hams F-12K
for 3h at 37°C. Following incubation, the suspension was aspirated and media replaced with complete
Hams F12-K with 10% FBS. Ad-transduced cells were incubated for 24h before performing flow cytometry
staining for surface expression of hACE2 using goat anti-human mAb AF933 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN) used at a final concentration of 10μg/mL. Separate plates, treated identically, were transferred to the
BSL-3 facility for subsequent infection with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays were performed on
cell supernatant or tissue homogenates. 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared in 0.2% BSA/PBS and plated
onto a VeroE6 monolayer and incubated with shaking for 1 hr. Inoculum was removed and plates were
overlaid with Minimal Essential Media (MEM) containing 2% FBS/0.05% oxiod agar and incubated for 72
hrs at 37°C. Plates were fixed with 4% formaldehyde overnight, stained with a mAb cocktail composed of
SARS-CoV-2 spike (Creative-Bios; 2BCE5) and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Creative-Biolabs; NP1C7C7)
followed by anti-Mouse IgG-HRP (Abcam ab6823) and developed using KPL TrueBlue peroxidase
substrate (Seracare; 5510-0030).
In vivo delivery of virus
For in vivo delivery of Ad vectors to the lung, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of
ketamine and xylazine diluted in water for injection (WFI; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). AdEmpty at 2.5x108 PFU, or Ad-hACE2 at doses of 2.5x108 PFU, 1.0x108 PFU or 7.5x107 PFU, were instilled
intranasally (i.n.) in a final volume of 50 μL sterile PBS. Untreated, control mice received the same volume
of sterile PBS. Mice were transferred to the BSL-3 facility on D3 post-Ad for subsequent challenge with
SARS-CoV-2 virus on D5. For SARS-CoV-2 challenge, mice were anesthetized as above and infected with
1x104 PFU in 50 μL of PBS. Mice were sacrificed at day 2 and day 5 post-infection by i.p. injection of
pentobarbital. 75% of lung and spleen, 50% of brain, and 3 inches of small intestine were homogenized in
1 ml of PBS using ceramic beads. Homogenates were briefly centrifuged and supernatant was immediately
used for plaque assays. Separate groups of mice were killed on D5 post-Ad instillation for an assessment
of lung histology (n=3-5 per group). For lung collection, mice were euthanized by CO2 exposure and death
confirmed by exsanguination following severing of the femoral artery. After death, the trachea was exposed
and lungs inflated with 1.5mL of 10% formalin using a 21G needle fitted to a 3mL syringe. Lungs were
removed intact, trimmed carefully and loaded into a tissue embedding cassette. Tissue was fixed overnight
in 10% formalin, transferred to PBS after 24h and sent for processing and paraffin embedding at the
Biorepository and Pathology Core at ISMMS.
Histology and hACE2 immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded lung tissue blocks for PBS-treated, Ad-Empty (2.5x108 PFU) or Ad-hACE2 at doses of
2.5x108-7.5x107 PFU, were cut into 5μm sections. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
by the Biorepository and Pathology Core, or serial sections (5μm) provided for immunohistochemical (IHCP) staining for hACE2 as follows; sections were deparaffinized in xylene-free clearing agent, Histo-Clear
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and rehydrated using a decreasing ethanol (EtOH) gradient.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating sections for 10min in Bloxall solution (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) between the first and second 100% EtOH rehydration steps. Antigen
retrieval was performed by boiling in sodium citrate (pH 6.0) solution, as described previously (38). Slides
were allowed to cool and were washed with PBS prior to blocking of endogenous biotin or avidin binding
proteins, using the Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as recommended by
the manufacturer. Sections were blocked for 30min at 37˚C with blocking buffer provided in the
VECTASTAIN® Elite ABC-HRP Kit (Rabbit IgG) with the addition of 1% (w/v) BSA to act as a stabilizer and
0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to facilitate permeabilization of the tissue. Following blocking, tissue sections were

Cambridge, MA] or monoclonal rabbit anti-human ACE2 antibody [clone #EPR4436; Abcam Cambridge,
MA) diluted in blocking buffer (see above) were added to one section on each slide at a final concentration
of 1.33μg/mL for 1h at room temperature. Following incubation, sections were washed three times in PBS.
Biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was prepared as instructed by guidelines for the
VECTASTAIN® Elite ABC-HRP (Rabbit IgG) kit and sections incubated for 30min at room temperature.
Following incubation, sections were washed in PBS and the VECTASTAIN ELITE ABC reagent was
prepared and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30min. The pre-made Elite ABC reagent was then
added to sections for 30min at room temperature. Cells were washed again three times in PBS and the
3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) prepared immediately prior to use and addition to each slide individually. Development of
a positive control slide was timed under a microscope and the same development time (10min) applied to
all other sections. Sections were transferred to distilled H2O and nuclei counterstained for 45s using
Haematoxylin QS (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) before being rinsed extensively with tap water.
Sections were then dehydrated by using an increasing gradient of EtOH, ending in Histo-Clear solution.
Sections were mounted using Histomount Solution (Life Technologies) and provided to a veterinary
pathologist at the Center for Comparative Medicine and Surgery (CCMS) Comparative Pathology
Laboratory, ISMMS (Dr. Virginia Gillespie). The pathologist evaluated and photographed both IHC-P for
hACE2, and H&E sections, and was blinded to the treatment groups. Images were captured under 200X
magnification using an Olympus BX43 with the Olympus DP21 Digital Camera system. Representative
images from each group are shown alongside a matched isotype control and H&E section.
Results
Validation of adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2
Recombinant Ad vectors can be used to transduce a wide-range of cell types, both in vitro and in vivo, and
are well-established to facilitate sustained transgene expression when used as a delivery vector (39-41).
Prior studies have demonstrated that Ad-mediated delivery of a functional viral entry receptor into mice,
such as the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) receptor for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), can render them permissive to infection with human viruses, which are otherwise
unable to support viral entry using the murine receptor homolog (33, 42). In order to validate the functionality
of our Ad constructs prior to in vivo challenge studies, we transduced A549 cells with an empty adenovirus
(Ad-Empty) or an adenovirus expressing hACE2 (Ad-hACE2). We confirmed by flow cytometry staining that
transduction of A549 cells with Ad-hACE2 resulted in detectable hACE2 expression on the surface of cells,
but no staining was detected following transduction with Ad-Empty (Fig.1A). A549 cells do not express
detectable levels of ACE2 (43), and it has been reported that they are not permissive to infection with
SARS-CoV-1 (43) or SARS-CoV-2 (1). In agreement with published studies, we confirmed that negative
control A549, or A549 cells transduced with Ad-Empty failed to support viral replication when infected with
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, while A549 cells transduced with Ad-hACE2 supported multicycle viral replication,
confirming the functionality of the Ad-hACE2 construct (Fig.1B).
To over-express hACE2 in the lungs of mice, we next administered BALB/c mice intranasally (i.n) with PBS,
2.5x108 PFU of Ad-Empty, 2.5x108, 1x108 or 7.5x107 PFU of Ad-hACE2. Innate immune responses to
significantly higher doses of Ad vectors (1x1011) are known to peak between 6-24h post-administration (36,
44). Therefore, we reasoned that in vivo challenge with SARS-CoV-2 at D5 post-Ad transduction would be
minimally impacted by non-specific inflammatory responses. In support of this, the D5 time-point has also
recently been used successfully for Ad-mediated delivery of viral receptors to the lungs of mice by other
investigators (33, 42). Five days post-transduction (D5), lungs were harvested for an evaluation of histology
by H&E staining, and by immunohistochemistry for hACE2 expression. All sections were assessed and
evaluated by a veterinary pathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups. H&E staining did not reveal
overt signs of inflammation due to administration of the Ad vectors and in general all sections were
considered to be very similar (Fig.2C). Specimens from all treatment groups were reported to display
diffuse, alveolar congestion with multifocal, acute hemorrhage comprising <25% of the section, along with
scant to mild fibrin deposition which was largely localized to the alveolar septa. These effects were
considered to be potentially associated with euthanasia using inhaled CO2 (45). One H&E section in the
7.5x107 PFU Ad-hACE2 group and one in the 2.5x108 PFU Ad-hACE2 group exhibited multifocal lymphoid
aggregates and a few scattered perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphocytes and plasma cells. The latter

section also had evidence of focal bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Random lymphoid
aggregates with no other associated lesions in multiple tissues including the lungs are common background
observations in mice (45). Therefore, any inflammation induced by the Ad vectors at the doses tested was
considered to be mild.
Sections from all treatment groups (PBS control, Ad-Empty at 2.5x108 PFU and Ad-hACE2 at increasing
doses) were stained using anti-hACE2 or species-matched isotype control mAb simultaneously (Fig.2D,
E). The anti-hACE2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) we used for IHC-P detection of hACE2 is specific for
hACE2 and lacks cross-reactivity to mouse tissue or to murine ACE2. No staining was observed for the
isotype control antibody (Fig.2D). PBS control sections were determined by the pathologist to be negative
for hACE2 staining. All Ad-hACE2 treated mice displayed a similar profile of hACE2 staining in the lung
with rare to segmental labeling of bronchiolar epithelial (BE) cells, multifocal patchy labeling of alveolar
septa (AS) and labeling of few alveolar macrophages (data not shown). In some sections, staining was also
observed on the endothelium and/or walls of few medium to small blood vessels. Positive staining was
patchy, as would be expected for non-uniform transduction of the lung with the Ad-hACE2 vector.
Transduction of epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells is consistent with the known
tropism and target cells for HAdV-C5 based vectors in mice (36, 39, 46, 47). Although the lowest dose of
Ad-hACE2 (7.5x107 PFU) appeared to yield a similar distribution of transduction in the lung to the highest
dose (2.5x108 PFU), the intensity of staining appeared to be dose-dependent with more intense brown
staining for hACE2 in the highest dose of Ad-hACE2 (2.5x108 PFU).
In order to determine the optimal Ad-ACE2 dose for SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo, separate groups of
BALB/c mice were administered with 2.5x108 (data also shown in Fig.2D), 1x108, or 7.5x107 PFU of AdACE2 followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 at D5 post-Ad transduction. Viral lung titers were similar
among the different doses, with slightly higher replication at the lowest Ad-ACE2 dose (Fig.1F), indicating
that doses as low as 7.5x107 PFU of adenovirus are sufficient to confer hACE2 expression and support
SARS-CoV-2 replication.
B6 and BALB/c Ad-hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infection
In parallel, we used our adenovirus constructs to transduce both B6 and BALB/c mice intranasally with
2.5x108 PFU of Ad-hACE2 or Ad-Empty. At 5-days post-transduction mice were infected with 1x104 pfu of
SARS-CoV-2 and monitored for body weight loss. Significant weight loss was not observed in any of the
groups on the B6 (Fig.2A) or Balb/c (Fig.2C) backgrounds at this dose of SARS-CoV-2, although mild
weight loss (<10%) was observed in an unrelated experiment when mice were challenged with a 5-fold
higher dose of SARS-CoV-2 (data not shown). At day 2 and day 5 post-infection, organs were harvested
from mice to determine viral titers. Ad-hACE2 transduced mice on both the B6 and BALB/c background
showed viral titers in the lung at day 2 post-infection, with titers decreasing at day 5. Viral titers in BALB/c
mice were ~1 log higher at day 2 compared to B6 mice (Fig.2B and 2D). No viral replication was observed
in the brain, spleen, or gut, consistent with i.n. administration of a relatively low dose of a HAdV-C5-based
Ad vector and established knowledge regarding the lack of significant tropism for these organs in mice (4850). WT B6, BALB/c, B6 Ad-Empty, and BALB/c Ad-Empty mice failed to support SARS-CoV-2 replication
as expected based on lack of hACE2 receptor expression.
K18-hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infection
B6 K18-hACE2 mice were similarly infected with 1x104 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 and monitored for weight loss
and viral titers. K18-hACE2 mice showed progressive weight loss – by day 7 one animal was below 75%
body weight and by day 8 one animal was found dead (Fig.3A). K18-hACE2 mice showed high viral titers
in the lung at day 2 post-infection, and some animals had virus in the brain. By day 5 post-infection viral
titers in the lung were reduced while titers in the brain had increased. Additionally, virus was detectable in
the gut by day 5 (Fig.3B). Notably, viral titers in the lung were 2-3 logs higher compared to Ad-hACE2
SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 to high titers in multiple organs likely reflects the
expression of hACE2 in cells of these organs in this transgenic mouse model (27).
Discussion
The development of small animal models which are permissive to infection with SARS-CoV-2 will be
invaluable, and will not only allow us to better understand the pathogenesis of the virus, but will enable
characterization of immune responses to vaccine platforms or immunization regimens which confer

protection. The rapid emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus prompted the research community to try to apply
information gained from historical studies of SARS-CoV-1 and other coronaviruses to the development of
a relevant animal model for SARS-CoV-2. It was already established in the literature that Syrian hamsters
were permissive to infection with SARS-CoV-1 (51-53), therefore it was reasonable that they might also
represent a useful model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, Syrian hamsters have recently been reported
to authentically model clinical features of severe human COVID-19 pathogenesis, including alveolar
damage and bilateral interstitial pneumonia (54). In addition, hamsters mounted neutralizing antibody
responses to SARS-CoV-2 which were capable of providing protection from subsequent virus re-challenge.
However, phenotypic or functional studies of T cell responses or other immune cell populations to
immunization or infection in Syrian hamsters may be limited by the lack of availability of reagents,
particularly when compared with mice. Therefore, the development of a permissive mouse model would
facilitate broad and adaptable applications to evaluate pathogenesis and replication, and uncover the
underlying factors that contribute to immunopathology. Mouse models offer a number of benefits in this
context, which include the accessibility of inbred genetic backgrounds on multiple strains, large numbers of
genetically-modified strains, existing models of co-morbidities such as obesity or diabetes (55), and
commercial access to many antibodies and tools for immunological studies.
Prior studies to validate a mouse model for other coronaviruses had reported the use of transgenic models
to express coronavirus receptors (27, 42, 56-60). Achieving this for MERS-CoV has parallels with SARSCoV-2 in the sense that standard laboratory strains of mice are not permissive to infection, as a result of
their inability to use the murine ortholog of their entry receptors, hDPP4 and hACE2, respectively. Studies
in which the homologs of these receptors were delivered either to non-permissive cells in vitro (43), or in
vivo to the mouse lung by overexpression via viral vectors (32, 42), could sensitize to infection. Since the
emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, investigators have rapidly responded to the pandemic by evaluating
the potential for already-generated (58), but not widely available, hACE2 transgenic mice in supporting
SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis (29, 30). Although useful, these models produced variable results
in which some supported low level SARS-CoV-2 replication with minimal morbidity or lung pathology (29),
and others exhibited signs of local and systemic disease which partially mimic symptoms of severe human
COVID-19 infection, including increased mortality in male mice (30). Several recent reports have also now
described the success of the Ad-hACE2 vector delivery approach in mice, and despite minor differences in
the approach, our results strongly support their findings (33, 61). We, and others, detected hACE2
expression predominantly on alveolar epithelial cells, with some expression in bronchiolar epithelial cells
following transduction with a dose of 2.5x108 PFU Ad-hACE2 (33, 61). In this study, we also detected some
transduction in endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages, which is consistent with the known in vivo
cellular tropism for Ad vectors based on HAdV-C5 in mice (36, 39, 49, 50).
The K18-hACE2 transgenic model has been well characterized for SARS-CoV-1 (27, 43), but to our
knowledge has not yet been comprehensively evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of measuring
morbidity and viral dissemination with subsequent replication in extra-pulmonary organs. Therefore, in this
study, we wanted to perform a head-to-head comparison of the K18-hACE2 model and the Ad-hACE2
murine model in supporting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in both BALB/c and B6 mice in parallel. We also
use different amounts of the Ad-hACE2 vector to determine if titers below 2.5x108 PFU could be used to
support SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We reasoned that a comparison of these different hACE2 model systems
would provide useful information for the research community in deciding which model to apply to specific
research hypotheses. Our findings have determined that while both the K18-hACE2 and Ad-hACE2 models
support SARS-CoV-2 replication, they have a number of advantages and disadvantages. SARS-CoV-2
replication in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice following a challenge dose of 1x104 PFU was substantially
higher than B6 mice (same genetic background) and BALB/c mice administered with Ad-hACE2 vectors.
In addition, the K18-hACE2 model resulted in more severe disease, manifesting in weight loss, and
replication in multiple organs – including lung, brain, and gut. Therefore, the K18-hACE2 mice could provide
a stringent model for testing vaccines and antivirals, where weight loss, mortality or extra-pulmonary viral
replication are end-points. However, brain infection and neurological complications, while reported in
humans, are not the primary cause of death in most human COVID-19 patients (35). While we did not
observe weight loss in the Ad-hACE2 model, a recent study using the same model did report weight loss
using a higher infectious dose (1x105 FFU compared to 1x104 PFU in our study). Other possible reasons
for discrepancies could include differences in routes of inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 (both i.n. and i.v.

compared to only i.n. in our study) (33). However, we have recently generated data in a separate
(unpublished) study which demonstrates mild weight loss when a challenge dose of 5x104 PFU is used.
Some studies using Ad-hACE2 have used IFNAR-/- mice, or have blocked IFNAR1 using α-IFNAR1 mAbs,
demonstrating that a lack of intact type I IFN response in mice resulted in greater weight loss and
exacerbated lung pathology upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (15, 33), and concluding that IFN may have
protective effects against SARS-CoV-2. However, this should be validated in an additional model for
hACE2, as there is evidence that blockade of Type I IFN can affect transgene expression from nonreplicating Ad vectors and T cell responses to the transgene/vector, which could confound results (39, 62).
Other caveats of the Ad-hACE2 animal model include the non-uniform transduction of the lung epithelium
(and consequently, non-uniform expression of hACE2 in the mouse lung), the possibility of triggering nonspecific inflammatory responses if used at doses higher than 2.5x108 PFU – or with poorly prepared Ad
stocks which have large quantities of empty capsids, and the potential lack of suitability for use of the AdhACE2 model in immunization studies using non-replicating Ad vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. However, with
this in mind, we describe the successful use of a dose of Ad-hACE2 (7.5x107 PFU) which supports
equivalent replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung to the previously reported higher dose (33, 61). Most
importantly, the flexibility of the Ad-hACE2 model allows studies of multiple mouse strains immediately,
without time-consuming breeding to a hACE2 transgenic or knock-in background. In conclusion, further
refinement and development of these models and additional small animal models will be critical for studying
disease pathogenesis, and for evaluating novel therapeutics and vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Figure 1. Validation of Ad-hACE2. (A) A549 cells were transduced with Ad-Empty or Ad-hACE2 at an
MOI of 100 for 3h at 37°C. 24h post-transduction, surface expression of hACE2 was detected by flow
cytometry. RFI = relative fluorescence intensity generated by multiplying % hACE2+ cells by the geometric
mean fluorescence. (B) A549 cells were transduced with Ad vectors as described in (A) followed by
infection 24h later with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 at an MOI of 0.1. Virus titers were determined by
plaque assay on VeroE6 cells. BALB/c mice were administered intranasally (i.n) with the indicated dose of
Ad-Empty, Ad-hACE2, or PBS. Lungs were harvested on day 5 post-transduction, paraffin embedded and
5μm sections stained for H&E (C), or for IHC-P using an isotype control (D) or α-hACE2 monoclonal
antibody (E). Regions of the lung anatomy are indicated on isotype control sections; AS = alveolar septa,
BE = bronchiolar epithelium, E = endothelium. Scale bar is 100nm. (F) Separate groups of BALB/c mice
administered i.n. with PBS, Ad-Empty or Ad-hACE2 (2.5x108, 1x108, or 7.5x107 PFU) were infected five
days later (D5) with 1x104 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 and lung viral titers were determined by plaque assay on D2
and D5 post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Note; data points for viral lung titers for BALB/c mice treated with AdhACE2 at a dose of 2.5x108 PFU shown in Fig.1F, are the same group of mice as shown in Fig.2D and are
shown for visualization purposes to allow a comparison between doses, although all groups were part of
the same larger experiment.

Figure 2. B6 and BALB/c Ad-hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infection (A-B) B6 mice and (C-D) Balb/c mice were
transduced with 2.5x108 PFU of Ad-empty, Ad-hACE2, or PBS. On D5 post-Ad administration mice were
infected with 1x104 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 and monitored for weight loss (A and C) and viral titers (B and D)
according to the indicated timeline. n=animal number at day 0, as animals were harvested for titers n was
reduced according to the diagram. Note; data points for viral lung titers for Balb/c mice treated with AdhACE2 at a dose of 2.5x108 PFU shown in Fig.2D, are the same group of mice as shown in Fig.1F.
