Abstract
Rapid and cost-efficient whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
COVID-19, is critical for understanding viral transmission dynamics. Here we show that using a
new multiplexed set of primers in conjunction with the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcode library
kit allows for faster, simpler, and less expensive SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. This primer
set results in amplicons that exhibit lower levels of variation in coverage compared to other
commonly used primer sets. Using five SARS-CoV-2 patient samples with C​q values between
20 and 31, we show that high-quality genomes can be generated with as few as 10,000 reads
(approximately 5 Mbp of sequence data). We also show that mis-classification of barcodes,
which may be more likely when using the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcode library prep, is
unlikely to cause problems in variant calling. This method reduces the time from RNA to
genome sequence by more than half compared to the more standard ligation-based Oxford
Nanopore library preparation method at considerably lower costs.

Introduction
The earliest known outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China in late 2019. By May of
2020, the disease had spread to more than 200 countries and territories, with more than five
million total confirmed cases ​(​Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center​)​. To slow the spread
of this disease, it is crucial to understand the origin and dynamics of outbreak events. Genome
sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of this disease, offers an effective means to
infer transmission events, and such genomic surveillance has been used successfully to
ascertain transmission events even in the absence of additional epidemiological data ​(Seemann
et al. 2020)​.
Several approaches have been used to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including
metagenomics ​(Manning et al. 2020)​, sequence capture ​(Gohl et al. 2020)​, SISPA ​(Moore et al.
2020)​, and multiplex PCR ​(Gohl et al. 2020; Itokawa et al. 2020; Resende et al. 2020; Moore et
al. 2020; Eden et al. 2020)​, followed by next generation sequencing using either the Illumina or
Oxford Nanopore platforms. Due to its simplicity and economy, using multiplexed PCR
amplicons is perhaps the most common approach. This technique has been used to
successfully sequence thousands of genomes over the first few months of the COVID-19
outbreak ​(GISAID Initiative)​. However, multiplexed amplicon sets often exhibit uneven
amplification across the genome, with up to 100-fold differences in the concentration of different
amplicons ​(Itokawa et al. 2020)​. In addition, the most common methods of library preparation for
next-generation sequencing remain relatively expensive, even when samples are multiplexed.
To alleviate these problems, here we describe an approach using multiplexed 1200 base pair
(bp) tiled amplicons with the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcoding kit (SQK-RBK004). Briefly, two
PCR reactions are performed for each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient sample to be sequenced.
One PCR reaction contains thirty primers that generate the odd numbered amplicons (‘Pool 1’),

while the second PCR reaction contains twenty eight primers that generate the even numbered
amplicons (‘Pool 2’; ​Fig. 1​). After PCR, the two amplicon pools are combined and can be used
for a range of downstream sequencing approaches. Here we use the Oxford Nanopore Rapid
barcoding kit which enables relatively easy library preparation of these amplicons to achieve
rapid, simple, and cost-effective sequencing.

Materials and Methods
RNA isolation and RT-qPCR:
Five de-identified samples that had been assessed as positive by other methods were obtained
from the New Zealand Auckland District Health Board. 80 µl of Viral Transport Media that had
previously stored a nasopharyngeal swab from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 were used
for RNA isolation using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini spin kit (Qiagen, Cat No./ID: 52904)
according to manufacturer specifications, with the following modifications: sample volume was
brought up from 80 µl to 140 µl using 1x PBS, and RNA was eluted using two elutions with 40 µl
Buffer AVE for a final volume of approximately 80 µl.
To determine C​q values, we performed quantitative RT PCR. We used the 2x SensiFAST Probe
No-ROX One-Step Mix (Bioline, Cat No./ID: BIO-76005), according to manufacturer
specifications using 2.5 µl RNA template. Primers and probes were from the CDC 2019-nCoV
CDC Assay (IDT, Cat No./ID: 10006606) targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. NP targets the RNase P gene for detection of human nucleic
acids and serves as an internal control for sample integrity. Reactions were run at a total
volume of 20 µl on the Liberty16 mobile real-time PCR device (Ubiquitome). The results are
shown in ​Table 2.

Whole Genome Sequencing
The detailed methods for Reverse Transcription, PCR, and library preparation have been
posted to protocols.io:
https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-sequencing-protocol-rapid-barcoding-1200-bgggjttw
Below we briefly summarize the method and provide additional notes on the genome assembly.
Two separate PCR reactions are done for each SARS-CoV2 positive sample. Two pools of
primers are made: ‘Pool 1’ contains thirty primers that generate the odd numbered tiled
amplicons, while ‘Pool 2’ contains twenty eight primers that generate the even numbered tiled
amplicons for the 1200 bp set (​Fig. 1​). This tiled approach is necessary to minimise overlap
between amplicons, which would decrease PCR efficiency as overlapping amplicons would
anneal to each other. After the PCR is completed, we combine the two pools.

Basecalling, assembly, and variant calling
We used Guppy Version 3.6.0 for basecalling and demultiplexing all runs. We used the ARTIC
Network bioinformatics protocol for all genome assembly and variant calling steps with the 1200
bp amplicon sets (​https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html​), with the
.bed and .tsv files adjusted accordingly to accommodate the different primer sequences and
binding locations. We used 250 bp as the minimum read length cut-off and 1500 bp as the
maximum length cut-off, which resulted in between 20% and 30% of the reads being filtered.
The primer sequences and .bed and .tsv files necessary for the ARTIC variant calling pipeline
are available on Zenodo ​https://zenodo.org/record/3897530#.Xuk7oGpLjep​.
To quantify the number of ambiguous bases in the genome assemblies, we excluded the first
and last 180 bp of the genome, which are outside of any amplicon set or which contain primer
binding sites, and are thus usually masked during the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline.

Read subsampling
To calculate how sequencing depth affected genome coverage for each amplicon set, we first
calculated the total number of Mbp collected for each amplicon set. We then scaled that total to
the required sequencing depth. For example, if a total of 40 Mbp of data was collected for one
amplicon set, we calculated genome coverage for that amplicon set, and then multiplied the
coverage values by the relevant factor (e.g. to calculate coverage for 20 Mbp of data, we
multiplied by 0.5). This removes the complicating issue that different amplicon sets have
different distributions of read lengths.
For read subsampling we used seqtk ​(​https://github.com/lh3/seqtk​)​. To simulate read
contamination, we used seqtk to subsample using a random seed, and concatenated the
subsampled read sets from two different samples, performing this for all possible pairwise
combinations. We then used the ARTIC Network bioinformatics pipeline after this subsampling
to call variants. The steps in the pipeline include filtering to exclude short reads and likely
chimeric reads, which we performed as noted above.

Results
Our first goal was to select an amplicon set resulting in even coverage across the SARS-CoV-2
genome, to ensure that we could obtain high-quality, complete genomes with minimal
sequencing depth. We tested four different tiled, multiplexed amplicon sets: the current ARTIC
network 400 base pair V3 primer pool, available from Integrated DNA technology (IDT catalog
number: 10006788), and three sets designed using Primal Scheme ​(Quick et al. 2017)​. These
sets generate amplicons that are approximately 1200 bp, 1500 bp, and 2000 bp in size (​File
S1​). In all cases, primers were multiplexed into two pools (‘Pool 1’ and ‘Pool 2’), creating a tiled
amplification of the entire SARS-CoV2 genome (​Fig. 1​).

Our second goal was to reduce the time and cost of library preparation. To this end, we used
the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcoding kit. This kit uses a transposase to attach barcodes and
motor proteins to DNA molecules, with library preparation taking less than 25 minutes of hands
on time and requiring minimal reagents (​Table S1​). This contrasts with the Oxford Nanopore
Ligation Sequencing kit (LSK-109) that is most commonly used ​(J. Quick, protocols.io)​, which
requires over two hours of hands on time for library preparation, as well as several third-party
reagents. In addition to using the Rapid Barcoding kit approach, we omit a bead-based cleanup
step after PCR, further reducing the time and cost.
We tested all four primer sets on two RT-qPCR positive patient samples, one with a cycle
quantification value (C​q​) of 20.3, and the second with a C​q of 31.2 (​Table ​1​), which is similar to
the mean C​q found in sputum, feces, and pharyngeal swabs, and considerably higher than that
found in nasal swabs ​(Wang et al. 2020)​. We found that all four primers sets produced adequate
results. However, the 1200 bp set exhibited the least variability, especially in the high C​q sample
(​Fig. 1​).

Figure 1. SARS-CoV2 genome coverage plots for different amplicon sets. ​We performed amplicon
sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with amplicons ranging from 400 bp (top) to 2000 bp in size
(bottom). Amplicon sets are shown as grey bars, with the amplicons in ‘Pool 1’ numbered (see Methods).
Read coverage is scaled so that mean coverage is 1000X for all amplicon sets. For each set of amplicons
we sequenced a low C​q sample (20.3) and a high C​q sample (31.2). Each amplicon set is shown in pairs.
The upper plot is the C​q 20.3 sample; the lower plot is the C​q 31.2 sample. The 1200 bp and 2000 bp
amplicon sets exhibit relatively even coverage across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, note
that for the high C​q ​2000 bp amplicon set, all amplicons in ‘Pool 1’ are approximately 1.5-fold higher levels
than those in ‘Pool 2’. In contrast to the 1200 bp and 2000 bp amplicon sets, several dropout regions are
apparent in the 400 bp and 1500 bp amplicon sets. In all cases, the variation in genome coverage is
higher for the sample with higher C​q​.

We quantified this variation by testing how many Mbp of read data was required to achieve 30X
coverage at every position in the genome (here we use Mbp of sequencing data and not read
number to mitigate the effects of differences in average read length between the samples). We
found that for the 1200 bp and 2000 bp amplicon sets, 30X read coverage across the 99.9% of
the genome could be achieved with only 3Mbp of data (​Fig. 2​). In contrast, for the 400 bp
amplicon set, genome coverage was far more variable, and for the high C​q sample, even with
20Mbp of data, 30X coverage was achieved for only 99% of the genome. We thus selected the
1200bp primer set for additional experiments, as this amplicon size yielded the most consistent
results.

Figure 2. Amount of sequence data required for 30-fold genome coverage. ​As more sequencing data
is collected, a greater fraction of the genome is covered. Here, we plot the amount of data required for
30X coverage, which is similar to the minimum level required for accurate variant calling. For both the
high and low C​q samples, the 1200 bp and 2000 bp amplicon sets achieved more than 99.9% genome
coverage with only 3 Mbp of data, and in the low C​q sample, the 1200 bp amplicon set achieved 99.9%
coverage with only 2 Mbp of data. In contrast, the 400 bp and 1500 bp amplicon sets were more variable
in coverage, especially for the high C​q sample. In the case of the 400 bp amplicon set, 99% genome
coverage at 30X required 19 Mbp of sequence data, and 99.9% was only achieved with 33 Mbp of
sequence data.

We next tested the reliability of the 1200 bp amplicon set with the Rapid Barcode kit library prep
using three additional SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples. Across these five samples, C​q
values ranged from 20 to 31 (​Table 1​). We multiplexed all five samples on a single flow cell for
four hours. Again we found relatively even genome coverage for all five samples, although for
higher C​q​ samples, there again appeared to be greater variability across the genome (​Fig. 3​).
We used the ARTIC Network bioinformatics pipeline (see ​Methods​) for genome assembly and
variant calling for these samples, and in all cases obtained assemblies with fewer than 10
ambiguous base pairs (​Table 2​), excluding the 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome, which are either
not part of an amplicon or which are primer sequences.

genome coverage for the 1200 bp amplicon set for samples with C​q values ranging from 20.3 to 31.2. For
all samples, minimum coverage exceeds 50 at all genomic positions (excluding the 5’ and 3’ UTR). Note
that the scale of the y-axes varies between plots. The locations of the amplicons are indicated above the
first plot.

We again quantified the sequencing depth (number of reads) required to achieve sufficient
genome coverage for assembly and variant calling. We downsampled the read sets for each
sample, varying the number of reads from 2,500 to 30,000 (approximately 1.25 Mbp to 15 Mbp,
assuming a pre-filtered average read length of 500 bp (​Table 2​)), and quantified the fraction of
the genome covered at varying depths (​Fig. 4​). We found that with low C​q samples, very few
reads were required to achieve high coverage depth across the genome. For the lowest C​q
samples, only 10,000 reads (approximately 5 Mbp) were required to achieve 50X coverage
depth over more than 99.9% of the genome.

complete set of unfiltered reads and mapped these reads to the reference sequence. For all five samples,

Finally, we quantified how sequencing depth affected genome assembly. Again, for low C​q
samples, only 10,000 reads were required to reach fewer than 20 ambiguous bases, and with
15,000 reads (approximately 7.5 Mbp), fewer than 10 ambiguous bases remained in the
genomes for all samples (​Fig. 5​)​.

Figure 5. Numbers of ambiguous bases at different sequencing depths. ​We subsampled reads and
used the filtering and assembly steps of the ARTIC Network bioinformatics pipeline. For all samples,
fewer than 10 ambiguous bases remain after subsampling to 15,000 reads. For samples with lower C​q​,
only 10,000 reads are required. The inset plot shows higher resolution at the lower end of the y-axis. The
colours of each sample on these plots are the same as those in ​Figs. 3 ​and ​4.

The method we use here relies on the Rapid Barcode library prep (RBK-004), which is
transposon based, and usually results in only a single barcode being present on a read. This
contrasts with the ligation-based library prep (LSK-109), for which most reads contain two
barcodes (one at each end of the molecule). For the ligation-based library prep, stringent
demultiplexing can be imposed that requires the same barcode to be present at both ends.
However, when demultiplexing samples prepared using the Rapid Barcoding method, such
stringent demultiplexing is not possible. Thus, there may be some crossover between samples
with different barcodes due either to (1) residual transposase activity after samples are pooled;
(2) low rates of ligation or chimaera formation between molecules (we observe between 0.05%
and 0.1% of all reads as being longer than the longest amplicon, although many of these are
human transcripts); or (3) mis-classification during the demultiplexing step performed by the
basecaller and demultiplexer, Guppy. We note that the latter phenomenon is unlikely to result in
high levels of barcode crossover: we find generally that fewer than 0.1% of all reads are

assigned to barcodes that have not been used in any specific experiment. For this reason, we
tested how read contamination affected variant calling.
We first subsampled 20,000 reads from all samples and called variants. In all cases, we found
that the variant calls matched those when using all reads (between 45,000 and 115,000 for all
samples (​Table 2​)). In order to analyze the effects of read contamination, we first removed
sample AKL-MU-2 (C​q 20.6) from consideration, as the variants in this sample were identical to
those in AKL-MU-5 (C​q 31.2). We then simulated read contamination for all pairwise
combinations of samples. Each of the four samples could be contaminated by any of the other
three, for a total of 12 possible combinations. The four samples we considered contained
between 7 and 10 variants (​Table 2​). Sample AKL-MU-5 (7 variants) and sample AKL-MU-4 (10
variants) shared no variants with any other sample. Samples AKL-MU-1 (8 variants) and
AKL-MU-3 (9 variants) shared 4 variants. Thus for only two of the 12 combinations were any
variants shared. For each combination of read sets, we simulated at 27 different levels of
contamination by adding between 40 and 10,000 reads from the other sample, keeping the total
number of reads constant (20,000). Thus, the level of read contamination varied from 0.2% to
50%. For all combinations of read sets and contaminant levels, we called variants using the
ARTIC Network bioinformatic pipeline, and tested whether these matched the variant calls when
using the uncontaminated read sets.
In no cases did we find any false positive SNPs (variants that were called despite not being
present in the uncontaminated original sample). Unsurprisingly, we found that as we increased
contamination levels, variants were no longer reliably called. However, in all cases this only
occurred at contamination levels greater than 5% (​Fig. 6​). In many cases all expected variants
were called even when read contamination levels were in excess of 25%.

Figure 6. Effects of read contamination on SNP call rate. ​We simulated read contamination by mixing
reads between all pairwise combinations of samples (see main text). We then calculated the fraction of
true positive SNP calls from these contaminated read sets. Note that the x-axis is on a log scale.

Discussion
Here we have shown that with a 1200 bp multiplexed amplicon set and the Oxford Nanopore
Rapid Barcode kit we can achieve rapid, simple, and inexpensive genome sequencing of
SARS-CoV-2. The sequence data results in even genome coverage, allowing high-quality viral
genomes to be assembled at 50X coverage with fewer than 20,000 reads, or approximately 10
Mbp of sequencing data, and often far less. Furthermore, we have shown that even when there
is read contamination, we can successfully call variants at levels of cross-sample contamination
exceeding 5%. This suggests that the increased level of barcode crossover that might result
when using the Rapid Barcode library prep method should rarely result in incorrect variant calls.
It will be critical to test this method on high C​q samples, as it is likely that achieving even
genome coverage will be more difficult in these cases. Here we have only tested samples up to
C​q 31. However, positive SARS-CoV-2 positive samples regularly have C​q values that are close
to 37 or 38, thus having approximately 100-fold fewer genome copies per mL of sample.
This method can readily be expanded to the full set of 12 Oxford Nanopore Rapid barcodes,
rather than the five we show here. There is a small amount of sequence data required for high
quality genome assemblies (we estimate approximately 300 Mbp for 12 barcodes, accounting
for variation in read counts among barcodes), and minimal effects of barcode crossover on
variant calling. This suggests that it should be possible to sequence multiple such libraries on a
single flow cell, with wash steps between sequencing runs.
