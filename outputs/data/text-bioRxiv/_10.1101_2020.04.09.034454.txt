Abstract

32
33

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes vary from asymptomatic infection to

34

death. This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor,

35

ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics

36

and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the

37

analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression

38

quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency

39

across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory

40

network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and

41

that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression.

42

Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that

43

these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic

44

immune response relative to other respiratory viruses. Our results reveal mechanisms

45

likely influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

Introduction

55
56

In December of 2019, a novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China and has

57

gone on to trigger a global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the

58

respiratory illness caused by this virus1. While most individuals with COVID-19

59

experience mild cold symptoms (cough and fever), some develop more severe disease

60

including pneumonia, which often necessitates mechanical ventilation2. In fact, an

61

estimated 5.7% of COVID-19 illnesses are fatal3. Enhanced risk of poor outcomes for

62

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of factors including advanced age, male

63

sex, and underlying cardiovascular and respiratory conditions4, 5. Yet, while the majority

64

of serious COVID-19 illness occurs in adults over 60, children are also thought to be

65

highly susceptible to infection. Moreover, recent data suggest that 38% of COVID-19

66

cases occurring in children are of moderate severity and 5.8% are severe or critical6,

67

highlighting a need for studying risk factors of illness in this population as well.

68
69

One factor that may underlie variation in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is the extent of

70

gene expression in the airway of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, and

71

TMPRSS2, the host protease that cleaves the viral spike protein and thus allows for

72

efficient virus-receptor binding7. Expression of these genes and their associated

73

programs in the nasal airway epithelium is of particular interest given that the nasal

74

epithelium is the primary site of infection for upper airway respiratory viruses, including

75

coronaviruses, and acts as the gateway through which upper airway infections can

76

spread into the lung. The airway epithelium is composed of multiple resident cell types

77

(e.g., mucus secretory, ciliated, basal stem cells, and rare epithelial cell types)

78

interdigitated with immune cells (e.g. T cells, mast cells, macrophages), and the relative

79

abundance of these cell types in the epithelium can greatly influence the expression of

80

particular genes8-10, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, since the airway

81

epithelium acts as a sentinel for the entire respiratory system, its cellular composition,

82

along with its transcriptional and functional characteristics, are significantly shaped by

83

interaction with environmental stimuli. These stimuli may be inhaled (e.g., cigarette

84

smoke, allergens, microorganisms) or endogenous, such as when signaling molecules

85

are produced by airway immune cells present during different disease states. One such

86

disease state is allergic airway inflammation caused by type 2 (T2) cytokines (IL-4, IL-5,

87

IL-13), which is common in both children and adults and has been associated with the

88

development of both asthma and COPD in a subgroup of patients11-13. T2 cytokines are

89

known to greatly modify gene expression in the airway epithelium, both through

90

transcriptional changes within cells and epithelial remodeling in the form of mucus

91

metaplasia11,

92

expression. In particular, respiratory viruses can modulate the expression of thousands

93

of genes within epithelial cells, while also recruiting and activating an assortment of

94

immune cells16-18. Even asymptomatic nasal carriage of respiratory viruses, which is

95

especially common in childhood, has been shown to be associated with both genome-

96

wide transcriptional re-programming and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in

97

the airway epithelium19, demonstrating how viral infection can drive pathology even

98

without overt signs of illness.

. Microbial infection is another strong regulator of airway epithelial

100

Genetic variation is another factor that may regulate gene expression in the airway

101

epithelium. Indeed, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses carried out in

102

many tissues have suggested that as many as 70% of genes expressed by a tissue or

103

organ are under genetic control20. Severity of human rhinovirus (HRV) respiratory illness

104

has specifically been associated with genetic variation in the epithelial genes CDHR321

105

and the ORMDL322 and, given differences in genetic variation across world populations,

106

it is possible that functional genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2-related genes could partly

107

explain population differences in COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

108
109

Finally, there are important questions regarding the host response to SARS-CoV-2

110

infection. For example, it is unclear whether specific antiviral defenses in the epithelium

111

are blocked by SARS-CoV-2 or whether the virus may trigger epithelial or immune cell

112

pathways that prolong airway infection, and/or even incite a hyperinflammatory state in

113

the lungs in some individuals that leads to more severe disease. Although large cohorts

114

of subjects infected by the novel coronavirus are still lacking, much can be learned by

115

exploring transcriptional responses to other coronavirus strains. In particular, because

116

nasal airway brushings capture both epithelial and immune cells present at the airway

117

surface, such samples collected from a cohort of subjects infected by a range of viruses

118

provide an opportunity to comprehensively investigate the potentially varied and

119

cascading effects of coronavirus infection on airway expression and function.

120
121

In this study, we first use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to elucidate the

122

cellular distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the nasal airway epithelium.

123

We also perform network and eQTL analysis of bulk gene expression data on nasal

124

airway epithelial brushings collected from a large cohort of asthmatic and healthy

125

children in order to identify the genetic and biological regulatory mechanisms governing

126

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. We then use multi-variable modeling to estimate the

127

relative contribution of these factors to population variation in the expression of these

128

two genes, and by performing experiments on mucociliary airway epithelial cultures

129

confirm a dominant role for both T2 inflammation and viral infection in regulating

130

expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Finally, we define the cellular and transcriptional

131

responses to in vivo coronavirus infections in the nasal airway of children.

Results

147
148

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed by multiple nasal airway epithelial cell types

149
150

We first examined ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression at a cell type level through single

151

cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of a nasal airway epithelial brushing from an

152

asthmatic subject. Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN)-based clustering of 8,291 cells

153

identified 9 epithelial and 3 immune cell populations (Figure 1a, Supplementary Table

154

1). We found that 7 epithelial cell populations contained ACE2+ cells (at low frequency),

155

with the highest frequency of positive cells found among basal/early secretory cells,

156

ciliated cells, and secretory cells (Figure 1b). We did not observe meaningful ACE2

157

expression among any of the immune cell populations, which included T cells, dendritic

158

cells, and mast cells. We found TMPRSS2 to be expressed by all epithelial cell types,

159

with a higher frequency of positive cells among the different cell types, compared to

160

ACE2 (Figure 1b,c). A small number of mast cells were also TMPRSS2+ (Figure 1c).

161
162
163

TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory co-expression network highly induced by

164

T2 inflammation

165
166

We next sought to determine the variation in nasal epithelial expression of ACE2 and

167

TMPRSS2 across healthy and asthmatic children, and to identify biological mechanisms

168

that regulate this variation. Thus, we performed weighted gene co-expression network

analysis (WGCNA) on whole transcriptome sequencing data from nasal airway

170

brushings of 695 Puerto Rican healthy and asthmatic children in the Genes-

171

Environments and Asthma in Latino Americans II study (GALA II). This analysis

172

identified 54 co-expression networks representing cell type-specific expression

173

programs such as ciliogenesis, mucus secretion, and pathways of immunity and airway

174

inflammation (Supplementary Table 2). The TMPRSS2 gene was contained within one

175

of a set of three highly correlated networks exhibiting strong enrichments for mucus

176

secretory cell genes and pathways (Figure 2a, Supplementary Table 2,3). For example,

177

the black network, which was highly correlated with TMPRSS2 expression (r=0.64,

178

p=1e-82), was strongly enriched for Golgi mediated transport and COPI-dependent

179

Golgi to ER transport pathways, both of which are involved in the normal processing

180

and transport of mucin proteins (Figure 2a). TMPRSS2 itself fell within and was highly

181

correlated with expression of the pink network (r=0.68, p=3e-97), which was highly

182

enriched for mucus goblet cell markers (p=2e-6, Figure 2a,b). The pink network was

183

also enriched for genes involved in the O-linked glycosylation of mucins pathway (p=9e-

184

4), which is vital to the function of mucus secretory cells, especially those induced by T2

185

inflammation (r=0.68, p=3e-97, Figure 2a,b). In fact, we found that this network

186

contained the T2 cytokine IL13 while being particularly enriched for genes known to

187

mark and transcriptionally regulate IL-13-induced mucus metaplasia (FCGBP, SPDEF,

188

FOXA3). The saddle brown network was also related to mucus secretory cells, and

189

contained the most canonical T2 inflammation markers11, 23 including POSTN, CLCA1,

190

CPA3, IL1RL1, CCL26, and was strongly correlated with both TMPRSS2 (r=0.61, p=5e-

191

72, Figure 2c) and the other T2 mucus secretory network (pink) (r=0.92, p=3e-280,

192

Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, we found ACE2 expression to be strongly

193

negatively correlated with expression of both T2 networks (pink: r=-0.61, p=3e-72,

194

saddle brown: r=-0.7, p=2e-102, Figure 2e,f). To identify subjects with high and low T2

195

inflammation, we hierarchically clustered all subjects based on the expression of genes

196

in the canonical T2 network (saddle brown). This resulted in the identification of two

197

distinct groups we labeled as T2-high (n=364) and T2-low (n=331) (Supplementary

198

Figure 1a). We found that this expression-derived T2 status was strongly associated

199

with traits known to be driven by T2 inflammation including IgE levels, exhaled nitric

200

oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophils, and asthma diagnosis (Supplementary Figure 1b-e).

201

Notably, TMPRSS2 levels were 1.3-fold higher in T2-high subjects (p=1e-62), while,

202

ACE2 expression was 1.4-fold lower in T2-high subjects (p=2e-48) (Figure 2d,g).

203
204

To investigate whether the strong in vivo relationship between airway T2 inflammation

205

and TMPRSS2/ACE2 expression is causal in nature, we performed in vitro stimulation

206

of paired air-liquid interface (ALI) mucociliary airway epithelial cultures with 72 hours of

207

IL-13 or mock stimulus (n=5 donors, Figure 3a). Performing paired differential

208

expression analysis between the mock and IL-13 stimulated cultures, we found that

209

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were strongly down- and up-regulated, respectively, supporting

210

our in vivo analysis results (log2FC= -0.67, p=5e-3, log2FC= 1.20, p=5e-9, Figure 3b,c).

211

To better understand the cellular basis of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 regulation by IL-13, we

212

leveraged scRNA-seq data previously generated on tracheal airway epithelial cultures

213

that were chronically stimulated (10 days) with IL-13 or control media (Figure 3a,d).

214

Similar to our results from in vivo nasal scRNA-seq data, we observed that ACE2

215

expression was highest among basal, ciliated, and early/intermediate secretory cell

216

populations, with ACE2 being significantly downregulated by IL-13 among both basal

217

and intermediate secretory cells (Figure 3e). Also mirroring the in vivo scRNA-seq data,

218

TMPRSS2 was expressed across all epithelial cell types, but at a higher frequency

219

among secretory cells (Figure 3f). IL-13 stimulation induced dramatic upregulation of

220

TMPRSS2 in early secretory, intermediate secretory, and mature mucus secretory cell

221

populations (Figure 3f). Furthermore, IL-13 stimulated mucus metaplasia that resulted in

222

the development of a novel mucus secretory cell type and an IL-13 inflammatory

223

epithelial cell that both highly expressed TMPRSS2 (Figure 3f). Together, our in vivo

224

and in vitro analyses strongly suggest that TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory cell

225

network that is highly induced by IL-13-mediated T2 inflammation.

ACE2 belongs to an interferon response network that is induced by respiratory

virus infections

232
233

Returning to the in vivo nasal airway epithelial expression networks, we found that

234

ACE2 expression was highly correlated with expression of two networks (purple and

235

tan) (purple: r=0.74, p=3e-120, tan: r=0.72, p=2e-110, Figure 4a,b). The purple network

236

was highly enriched for genes that mark cytotoxic T cells and antigen-presenting

237

dendritic cells, both of which are particularly abundant in a virally infected epithelium

238

(Figure 4c, Supplementary Table 2), whereas the tan network was strongly enriched for

239

interferon and other epithelial viral response genes (IFI6, IRF7, CXCL10, CXCL11)

240

(Figure 4c, Supplementary Table 2). Clustering of subjects based on the interferon

241

response network genes resulted in two groups, one highly (interferon-high=78) and

242

one lowly (interferon-low=617) expressing these interferon response network genes

243

(Supplementary Figure 2). We found that ACE2 expression was 1.7-fold higher in the

244

interferon-high vs. interferon-low group (Figure 4d). In a previous study, we found that

245

children with nasal gene expression characteristic of the interferon network tended to be

246

infected with a respiratory virus, despite being asymptomatic19. To explore the

247

possibility of this relationship in our current dataset, we metagenomically analyzed the

248

RNA-seq data for all subjects to identify those harboring reads for a respiratory virus.

249

This analysis found that 18% of GALA II children were asymptomatically harboring a

250

respiratory virus from one of eight general respiratory virus groups (Figure 4e).

251

Strikingly, we found that 78% of interferon-high subjects were virus carriers compared to

252

only 10% of interferon-low subjects. These results demonstrate how asymptomatic virus

253

carriage nonetheless stimulates an active viral response that includes ACE2.

254
255

To directly test the effect of respiratory virus infection on epithelial ACE2 gene

256

expression we again employed our ALI mucociliary epithelial culture system. Performing

257

mock or human rhinovirus-A16 infection of mature cultures (Day 27, Figure 4f) from 5

258

donors we found 7.7-fold upregulation of ACE2 gene expression with HRV-A infection

259

(p=1.3e-51, Figure 4g). In contrast, we only observed a trend for down regulation of

260

TMPRSS2 gene expression among virally infected subjects (Figure 4h). These results

261

confirm the strong regulation of ACE2 gene expression by viral infection.

263

Genetic determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the nasal airway

264

epithelium

265
266

We next explored the role of genetic regulatory variants in helping to drive epithelial

267

expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To do this, we performed cis-eQTL analysis for

268

these two genes, using nasal gene expression and genome-wide genetic variation data

269

collected from the GALA II study children. We identified 316 and 36 genetic variants

270

significantly associated with expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively (Figure

271

5a,b). Stepwise forward-backward regression analysis of these eQTL variants revealed

272

a single independent eQTL variant (rs181603331) for the ACE2 gene (6e-23), located

273

~20kb downstream of the transcription start site (Figure 5a). This rare eQTL variant

274

(allele frequency [AF]=1%) was associated with a large decrease in ACE2 expression

275

(log2AFC=-1.6) (Figure 5c).

276

Similar analysis of the TMPRSS2 eQTL variants yielded three independent eQTL

277

variants (rs1475908 AF=20%, rs74659079 AF=4%, and rs2838057 AF=13%, Figure

278

5b). The eQTL variant rs1475908 was associated with a decrease in TMPRSS2

279

expression (log2AFC=-0.37, Figure 5d), whereas both the rs74659079 and rs2838057

280

eQTL variants were associated with increased TMPRSS2 expression (log2AFC=0.38,

281

0.43, respectively, Supplementary Figure 3).

282
283

Examining the frequency of these eQTL variants among eight world populations listed in

284

the gnomAD genetic variation database (v2.1.1), we found that the ACE2 eQTL variant

was only present in people of African descent and at a low frequency (AF=0.7%, Figure

286

5e). In contrast, the TMPRSS2 eQTL variant associated with decreased expression,

287

rs1475908, occurred across all world populations, with the highest allele frequencies

288

among East Asians (AF=38%), Europeans (AF=35%), intermediate frequencies among

289

Africans (AF=26%) and Ashkenazi Jews (AF=23%), and the lowest frequency among

290

Latinos (AF=17%). The two TMPRSS2 eQTL variants associated with increased

291

expression exhibited much more disparate allele frequencies across world populations.

292

Namely, the allele frequency of rs74659079 is above 1% only among people of African

293

descent (AF=11%) and 4% in the participating Puerto Rican population. Likewise, the

294

rs2838057 eQTL variant, which was associated with increased TMPRSS2 expression

295

was present at a frequency of 32% in East Asians, 20% in Latinos, and <10% in all

296

other world populations. Together, these results suggest that if TMPRSS2 levels

297

influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, then genetics may play a significant role in

298

infection risk and that this risk will vary significantly across world populations.

Multi-variable modeling of airway ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression

302
303

Our analyses indicate that T2 inflammation, interferon/viral response signaling, and

304

genetics are all determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in the airway

305

epithelium of children. Therefore, we next sought to determine the relative importance of

306

these factors in determining levels of these genes using multi-variable regression

307

analysis. We included asthma status, age, and sex as model covariates since chronic

308

lung disease, increasing age, and male sex have all been associated with increased risk

309

of poor COVID-19 illness outcomes. Modeling ACE2 expression among GALA II

310

children, we found that T2 and interferon statuses had the strongest effects on ACE2

311

expression (p=1.6e-57, p=6.5e-43, respectively), with T2-low and interferon-high

312

individuals exhibiting the highest levels of expression. These two variables

313

independently explained 24% and 17% of the variance in ACE2 expression (Table 1).

314

While the ACE2 eQTL variant, rs181603331, was associated with a notable decrease in

315

ACE2 levels, it only accounted for 1.2% of the variance, reflecting the low frequency of

316

this variant in our population. Increasing age and asthma diagnosis were both

317

associated with small decreases in ACE2 expression, although both variables

318

accounted for less than 2% of the variance, and sex was not a significant predictor

319

(Table 1).

320
321

Similar modeling of TMPRSS2 expression found that T2-high status dramatically

322

increased expression, with an effect size 5.4x larger than any other variable, capturing

323

33% of total variation in TMPRSS2 (Table 1). While statistically significant, the two

324

TMPRSS2 eQTL variants associated with increased expression exhibited small effect

325

sizes totaling <1% of variance explained. All other predictors were not significant.

326

Collectively, these modeling results confirm that both T2 and interferon inflammation are

327

strong and antagonistic regulators of ACE2 expression and show that T2 inflammation

328

is the lone dominant driver of airway expression of TMPRSS2.

331
332

Our metagenomic analysis of RNA-seq data from the nasal brushings identified 18

333

children with viral sequence reads from one of four different coronavirus (CoV) species

334

(OC43, JKU1, 229E, NL63) (Supplementary Table 5). This allowed us to explore airway

335

transcriptomic responses to infection with coronavirus subfamily viruses specifically,

336

which will likely most resemble responses to SARS-CoV-2. To increase the likelihood

337

that these subjects were experiencing an active viral infection, we limited our analysis to

338

the 11 most highly infected subjects, comparing them to all subjects not infected with a

339

virus (n=571). To allow us to discriminate CoV-enhanced responses from those that are

340

more general to respiratory viruses, we also established a virus control group composed

341

of the 37 subjects highly infected with human rhinovirus species (HRV) (Supplementary

342

Table 6). We first compared expression of genes in the cytotoxic immune response

343

(purple) network and interferon response (tan) network (discussed earlier; see Figure

344

4a, b) among these virus infected groups, and found that both networks were more

345

highly expressed in virus-infected individuals (Figure 6a, b). Moreover, while the

346

induction in interferon response was similar for both CoV and HRV groups, induction in

347

the cytotoxic immune response was considerably higher in CoV-infected (ΔEg = 0.049)

348

compared to HRV-infected individuals (ΔEg = 0.032, Figure 6b).

349

To further explore this increase in cytotoxic immune response and other potential

350

pathways in CoV-infected individuals, we next performed a transcriptome-wide screen

351

for genes differentially expressed in CoV or HRV-infected groups compared to

352

uninfected individuals. These analyses revealed 2,515 differentially expressed genes

353

(DEGs) with CoV infection and 2,357 DEGs with HRV infection (FDR < 0.05 and log2FC

354

> |0.5|), of which 35% and 31% were only observed with CoV and HRV infections,

355

respectively, based on our significance cutoff (Figure 6c). Upstream regulator analysis

356

with IPA carried out separately on CoV and HRV infection response genes showed that

357

the top cytokines and transcription factors that may regulate these infections are shared

358

between the two virus families, including IL10, IL1B, IFNG, IFNA2, and STAT1 (Figure

359

6d). One inferred upstream regulator of CoV response genes, IL-6, which was also

360

among the genes upregulated with CoV infection (log2FC=2.2, Figure 6e), is especially

361

noteworthy considering that an IL-6 blocking antibody therapy is currently under

362

investigation for use in treatment of COVID-19 illnesses24. Additionally, we found ACE2

363

among the shared upregulated genes, reinforcing its upregulation in the course of

364

different respiratory virus infections (log2FC in CoV+=0.6, log2FC in HRV+=0.5, Figure

365

6e).

366
367

In trying to understand the biological basis of the viral responses we found to be CoV-

368

specific in our differential expression analysis, we considered whether the differential

369

presence and/or response of various immune cell types was an explanatory factor. To

370

investigate this, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to test for enrichment of

371

CoV-specific, HRV-specific, and CoV/HRV-shared DEG sets among gene markers for

372

11 different flow-sorted human immune cell types defined based on whole transcriptome

373

data (citation) (Supplementary Table 7). The shared viral DEGs showed significant

374

enrichment for genes characteristic of macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic

375

cells, and NK cells. In contrast, the set of CoV-enhanced DEGs resulted in strong

376

enrichments for both CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, suggesting an especially

377

important role for activation of cytotoxic T cells though antigen presentation by dendritic

378

cells in CoV infections (Figure 6f). Also supporting an enriched cytotoxic response

379

among CoV-infected subjects was a strong enrichment for CoV-specific DEGs among

380

NK cells, which participate heavily in the killing of virally infected cells (Figure 6g). We

381

note that these enrichments were not observed among HRV-enhanced DEGs, which

382

were instead most strongly enriched among neutrophils, as well as eosinophils,

383

macrophages, and monocytes. Furthermore, through pathway analysis we identified

384

multiple pathways related to cytotoxic T cell and NK cell activity that were enriched

385

either specifically or more dramatically among CoV DEGs compared to HRV DEGs

386

(Figure 6e). These results suggest that while CoV infections are highly similar to HRV

387

infections, they likely elicit an enhanced cytotoxic immune response.

Discussion

390
391

Although the high variability in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 illness is now well

392

documented and multiple demographic and clinical traits have been associated with

393

severe disease, little is known about the host biologic factors underlying this variability.

394

In the current study, we reasoned that population variation in upper airway expression

395

of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the virus-activating TMPRSS2 protease,

396

would drive infection susceptibility and disease severity. We therefore deployed network

397

and eQTL analysis of nasal airway epithelial transcriptome data from a large cohort of

398

healthy and asthmatic children to determine mechanisms associated with airway

399

expression of these genes, and their relative power in explaining variation in the

18

400

expression of these genes among children. We observed only weak associations with

401

asthma status, age, and gender among children aged 8-21 years. Moreover, although

402

we found that genetics does influence expression of these genes, the effect of this

403

variation was small in comparison to the dramatic influence of T2 cytokine-driven

404

inflammation on both ACE2 (downregulation) and TMPRSS2 (upregulation) expression

405

levels. We found an equally important role for viral-driven interferon inflammation in

406

regulating levels of ACE2 in the airway. Additionally, through study of in vivo upper

407

airway CoV subfamily infections, we not only identify inflammatory regulators of these

408

infections, but also provide evidence that this subfamily of viruses drives an enhanced

409

cytotoxic immune response. Our work provides a set of biomarkers that can be easily

410

examined in COVID-19 patients, through analysis of nasal swabs, to determine the

411

relative importance of these mechanisms and genes in governing susceptibility to

412

infection, severe illness and death.

413
414

Our single cell analysis of an in vivo nasal brushing observed ACE2 expression, albeit

415

at low frequency, primarily among basal, ciliated, and less mature, early secretory cells.

416

These results are supported by a recent report of ACE2 expression in transient

417

secretory cells, likely a close equivalent to our early secretory population25. Although a

418

much higher portion of cells, representing all epithelial cell types, expressed TMPRSS2,

419

the low frequency of ACE2+ cells resulted in very few dual ACE2/TMPRSS2 expressing

420

cells. However, we caution that a cell may not need to be TMPRSS2+ to be susceptible

421

to infection, since it has been demonstrated the TMPRSS2 protein is secreted from

422

nasal airway epithelial cells26. We also caution that scRNA-seq data are known to

423

exhibit biases in gene detection, and thus the level and frequency of ACE2 expression

424

across cells may be much higher than we observe here. In line with this possibility we

425

observe more moderate levels of ACE2 expression in our bulk RNA-seq data on nasal

426

brushings.

427
428

Airway inflammation caused by type 2 cytokine production from infiltrating immune cells

429

plays a prominent role in the control of cellular composition, expression, and thus

430

biology of the airway epithelium11, 13, 23, 27. Moreover, while T2 airway inflammation is an

431

important driver of T2-high asthma and COPD disease endotypes, it is also associated

432

with atopy in the absence of lung disease, a very common phenotype in both children

433

and adults. In fact, among the children in this study, we find that 43% of non-asthmatics

434

were scored as T2-high based on expression profile, further substantiating the high

435

prevalence of T2 airway inflammation outside of those with lung disease. Our data

436

suggest that airway epithelial TMPRSS2 expression is highly upregulated by T2

437

inflammation, and specifically by IL-13. Both our network and single cell data show that

438

TMPRSS2 is most prominent in less developed “early secretory” cells as well as in more

439

mature mucus secretory cells. Based on our in vitro data, IL-13 upregulates TMPRSS2

440

across nearly all types of epithelial cells, but the core of this effect appears to be in the

441

metaplastic mucus secretory cells that are generated as a consequence of IL-13

442

signaling14, 15. In fact, our network data suggest that, although TMPRSS2 expression is

443

highly correlated with that of a co-expressed network of mucus secretory genes

444

characterizing “normal”, non-metaplastic, mucus secretory cells, it’s correlated even

445

more strongly with a network that characterizes mucus secretory cells undergoing IL-13-

446

induced metaplasia. In contrast to enhanced levels of TMPRSS2, T2 inflammation,

447

whether observed in vivo or induced with IL-13 stimulation, precipitated a dramatic

448

reduction in levels of epithelial ACE2, thus complicating expectations for how T2

449

inflammation might affect overall risk for a poor COVID-19 outcome. Germane to this

450

question, a recent study of 85 fatal COVID-19 subjects found that 81.2% of them

451

exhibited very low levels of blood eosinophil levels4. Blood eosinophil levels are a

452

strong, well-known predictor of airway T2 inflammation and were strongly correlated

453

with T2 status in our study as well11,

454

that T2 inflammation may predispose individuals to experience better COVID-19

455

outcomes through a decrease in airway levels of ACE2 that override any countervailing

456

effect from increased expression of TMPRSS2. However, both in vitro experiments

457

examining IL-13 effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and empirical data on COVID-19

458

outcomes among T2-high and T2-low patients will certainly be needed to determine

459

whether this common airway inflammatory endotype ultimately protects against or

460

exacerbates COVID-19 illness. As mentioned above, we note that measurement of

461

blood eosinophil levels could be used as an informative and more accessible (albeit less

462

powerful) proxy for investigating the association between airway T2 inflammation and

463

outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, given the higher frequency of T2 inflammation

464

among asthmatic subjects, this population should be monitored especially closely given

465

the enhanced risk of complications due to respiratory virus infection in those with

466

asthma.

23

. Together, these studies provisionally suggest

468

In addition to a strong negative influence of T2 inflammation on ACE2 expression in the

469

airway, we found an equally strong positive influence of respiratory virus infections on

470

levels of this gene. Network analysis placed ACE2 within an interferon viral response

471

network suggesting that these cytokines are a driving force behind ACE2 upregulation.

472

This information is interesting in several regards. First, it suggests that SARS-CoV-2

473

and other coronaviruses using ACE2 as a receptor could leverage the host anti-viral

474

response to increase the infectability of airway cells. Secondly, as data here and

475

elsewhere show, asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses is common, especially in

476

young children19,

477

age from 8-21 years; among them we found 18% who were carrying respiratory viruses

478

without illness. However, as we show in this and our previous study19, even

479

asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses exacts a fundamental change in airway

480

epithelial expression and immune cell presence, including upregulation of ACE2

481

expression. In determining outcomes, this potential detrimental influence of virus

482

carriage may also be weighed against a potentially beneficial influence of virus carriage

483

through a more potent cross serologic-immune defense in these individuals, especially if

484

the virus carried is a coronavirus family member. Ultimately, the effect of current or

485

recent virus carriage on COVID-19 outcomes will need to be determined by in vivo

486

studies in patients, followed up with controlled in vitro studies of virally infected cells. At

487

any rate, the apparent dependence of ACE2 expression on interferon signaling

488

suggests that targeted blockade of this interferon effect could control SARS-CoV-2

489

infection.

28-31

. Children in the GALA II cohort included in this study ranged in

491

Our evaluation of genetic influences on airway ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression

492

revealed a single rare eQTL for ACE2 and several more frequent eQTL variants for

493

TMPRSS2. While both the effect size and explanatory power of these variants paled in

494

comparison to the influence of T2 inflammation and interferon signaling in multi-variable

495

modeling of expression for these genes, the effect of these variants may still be strong

496

enough to alter infection rates and or illness severity, especially in the populations

497

where these variants are most frequent. Thus, future genetic studies of COVID-19

498

should pay particular attention to these eQTL variants.

499
500

A particularly vexing question regards the mechanisms that underlie the unusual

501

severity of illness associated with SARS-CoV-2, especially when compared to most

502

circulating respiratory viruses. Clearly, severe disease often entails development of

503

pneumonia, possibly resulting from an expanded tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to include

504

lower lung airway and alveolar cells. The most severe patients also appear to

505

experience an exuberant immune response, characterized a “cytokine storm”24,

506

occurring with and possibly driving the development of acute respiratory distress

507

syndrome (ARDS). Supposing that aspects of epithelial response to coronavirus family

508

members would be shared, including with SARS-CoV-2, we examined in vivo

509

coronavirus infection among the GALA II children. We found that CoV infections elicit a

510

broad airway transcriptome response, similar to HRV infections, and we identified a

511

panel of cytokines and transcription factors that likely regulate these responses. In

512

particular, we found that IL-6 was predicted to regulate responses to CoV and was itself

513

upregulated with these infections. These data support the recent investigation of

23

514

tocilizumab (IL-6R blocking antibody) for the treatment of COVID-19 illnesses24.

515

Strikingly our analysis revealed an increased cytotoxic immune response with CoV

516

infection, driven by the differential presence and activity of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and

517

NK cells, as compared to the more heavily neutrophil-based responses to HRV

518

infection. Although preliminary, this finding, if similarly occurring with SARS-CoV-2

519

infection, could partly explain the dramatic inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2

520

patients, which can extend to the distal lung.

521
522

In summary, our data suggests that the strongest determinants of airway ACE2 and

523

TMPRSS2 expression are T2 inflammation and viral-induced interferon inflammation,

524

with limited but noteworthy influence from genetic variation. Whether these factors drive

525

better or worse clinical outcomes remains to be determined, but closely watching

526

individuals with these airway endotypes in the clinical management of COVID-19

527

illnesses would be prudent.

547

(ACP) at National Jewish Health (HS-3101) we consented a 56 year old asthmatic

548

subject, from which we collected nasal airway epithelial cells. The nasal airway cells

549

were brushed from the inferior turbinate using a cytology brush and used for the scRNA-

seq experiment described in Figure 1. Nasal airway epithelial cells used for bulk RNA-

551

seq network and eQTL analysis came from GALA II study subjects described below.

552

Nasal airway epithelial cell ALI culture experiments all used cells derived from GALA II

study subjects. Human tracheal airway epithelial cells used for in vitro IL13 stimulation

554

and scRNA-seq experiment were isolated from a single de-identified lung donor

555

obtained from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (Edison, NJ),

Bulk RNA sequencing of GALA II and ALI Samples

584

Total RNA was isolated from GALA II subject nasal airway epithelial brushings using the

585

AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). Whole transcriptome libraries

586

were constructed using the KAPA Stranded mRNA-seq library kit (Roche Sequencing

587

and Life Science, Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) from 250ng of total input RNA

588

with the Beckman Coulter Biomek FXP automation system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,

589

CA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Barcoded libraries were pooled and

590

sequenced using 125bp paired-end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina,

591

San Diego, CA). Bulk RNA-seq data for the nasal and tracheal ALI cultures to measure

592

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels reported in Figures 3b,c and 4g,h, was generated with

593

KAPA Hyperprep Stranded mRNA-seq library kits (Roche Sequencing and Life Science,

594

Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and sequenced with a Novaseq 6000 using 150bp

595

paired end reads.

Whole genome sequencing of GALA II Samples

599

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood obtained from GALA II study subjects

600

using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kits (Promega, Fitchburg, WI), and DNA

601

was quantified by fluorescent assay. DNA samples were sequenced as part of the

602

Trans Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole genome sequencing (WGS)

603

Experiments using an air-liquid interface, mucociliary culture system

612

Primary human basal airway epithelial cells were expanded and differentiated at air-

613

liquid interface (ALI) in vitro according to established protocols36. Paired tracheal ALI

614

cultures were mock-treated or treated with 10 ng/mL IL-13 in media (20 µL apical; 500

615

µL basolateral) for the final 10 days of differentiation (ALI days 11-21) before harvest

616

and scRNA-seq analysis. In contrast, nasal ALI cultures used for bulk RNA-seq analysis

617

(N = 5 GALA II subjects) were either stimulated with IL-13 for 72h following completion

618

of mucociliary differentiation (25 days) or were infected with human rhinovirus strain

619

A16 for 4 h during the final 24 h of the 28 days of differentiation. Control cultures were

620

only treated with media.

Following stimulation experiments involving the tracheal airway epithelial ALI samples,

624

apical culture chambers were washed once with PBS and once with PBS supplemented

625

with dithiothreitol (DTT;10mM), followed by two PBS washes to remove residual DTT.

Nasal airway epithelium brushing bulk RNA-seq analysis

652
653

Preprocessing of RNA-seq data

654

Raw sequencing reads were trimmed using skewer37 (v0.2.2) with the following

655

parameter settings: end-quality=15, mean-quality=25, min=30. Trimmed reads were

656

then aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38 using GSNAP38 (v20160501)

657

with the following parameter settings: max-mismatches=0.05, indel-penalty=2, batch=3,

658

expand-offsets=0, use-sarray=0, merge-distant-same-chr. Gene quantification was

659

performed with htseq-count39 (v0.9.1) using iGenomes GRCh38 gene transcript model.

660

Variance stabilization transformation (VST) implemented in DESeq240 (v1.22.2) was

661

then carried out on the raw gene count matrix to create a variance stabilized gene

662

expression matrix suitable for downstream analyses.

Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on GALA II RNA-seq data

665

To understand what biological mechanisms regulate the variation of nasal airway

666

epithelial gene expression, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis41

667

(WGCNA) v1.68 was performed on the VST matrix of 17,473 expressed genes.

668

WGCNA analysis is a network-based approach that assumes a scale-free network

669

topology. To adhere to the scale-free assumption of the constructed biological networks,

670

a soft thresholding parameter (ß) value of 9 was chosen based on WGCNA guidelines.

671

Furthermore, minClusterSize was set to 20, deepSplit was set to 2, and pamStage was

672

set to TRUE. A total of 54 co-expression networks were identified and described in

673

Supplementary Table 2. WGCNA networks are referred to by different colors, and two of

674

the these identified networks, saddle brown and tan were found to capture co-

675

expressed genes that underlie T2 inflammation and interferon inflammation,

676

respectively. We hierarchically clustered all subjects based on expression of genes in

677

the saddle brown network and then used the first split in the dendrogram as the basis

678

for assigning individuals to T2-high or T2-low categories (Supplementary Figure 1a).

679

Similarly, we hierarchically clustered subjects using the genes in tan network and then

680

selected the dendrogram branches with the highest tan network expression as

681

interferon-high and the other subjects as interferon-low (Supplementary Figure 2a).

682
683

Cis-eQTL analysis of nasal RNA-seq data

684

Cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis was performed by following the

685

general methodology of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project version 7

686

protocol42, using the nasal RNA-seq data and WGS variant data from 681 GALA II

687

subjects.

688

Namely, WGS variant data was filtered based on allele frequency (minor allele

689

frequency > 1%) and allele subject count (total number of subjects carrying minor allele

690

≥ 10). After filtering,

analysis. For expression data filtering and preparation, we first ran Kallisto43 (v0.43.0) to

692

generate transcript per million (TPM) values. We filtered out any genes that did not

693

reach both TPM > 0.1 and raw counts > 6 for at least 20% of our samples. After filtering,

694

17,039 genes were then TMM normalized using edgeR44 (v3.22.3). Finally, we applied

695

an inverse normal transformation into the TMM-normalized expression values to render

696

them suitable for eQTL analysis. To account for global population structure, we ran

ran Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals46 (PEER, v1.3) to create 60 PEER

699

factors to utilize as covariates in the eQTL analysis along with admixture estimates,

700

gender, age, body-mass index (BMI), and asthma diagnosis status. To perform cis-

701

eQTL analysis, we utilized a modified version of FastQTL47 that was provided by the

702

GTEx project. Furthermore, we performed stepwise regression analysis to identify

703

independent eQTL variants using QTLTools48 (v1.1). Allelic Fold Change (AFC) of the

704

eQTL variant is computed using the aFC python script49.

Virus identification and quantification from bulk RNA-Seq data

707

To identify individuals with asymptomatic virus infection at the time of sample collection,

708

viral genomic sequences were recovered from bulk RNA-seq data using a modified

709

version of the Virus Finder 2.0 (VF2) pipeline50. A custom respiratory virus reference

710

database comprising >600k sequences was employed to improve specificity. Using

711

VF2, viral reads were garnered by removing human reads using Bowtie251 (default

712

settings) and selecting viral reads using BLAT52 (minIdentity=80); contigs were

713

assembled using Trinity53; short (<200 bp) or low complexity (DUST score < 0.07)

714

contigs and contigs matching the human genome at a BLAST54 e-value <0.05 were

715

discarded; the remaining contigs were classified using BLAST (e-value <0.05); read

716

counts were obtained by read mapping using BLAT (minIdentity=98). Of the 468 distinct

717

viral reference sequences detected by VF2, 7 were identified as erroneous and

718

removed. The remaining 461 matches were manually assigned viral serotypes and the

719

results aggregated with R.

Defining CoV and HRV infected groups and associated analysis

722

To ensure we selected subjects that were experiencing an active host response to a

723

CoV infection, we examined the distribution of viral reads for the 18 CoV+ infected

724

subjects. We observed a clear break between the 7 subjects with the lowest viral read

725

counts (<3,000 reads) and 11 subjects with the highest viral read counts (>60,000

726

reads). Therefore, we selected these 11 highly infected subjects for analysis of host

727

responses to CoV infection. To generate a similar infection-control group, composed of

728

subjects highly infected with a different virus species, we examined the 67 HRV infected

729

subjects in GALA, enforcing a comparable lower bound of viral reads as with CoV,

730

adjusting for the smaller HRV genome size. Specifically, HRV genomes are ~7,000

731

base pairs, whereas CoV genomes are ~30,000 base pairs, making the HRV genome

732

~25% of the size of the CoV genome. Therefore, we selected a cutoff of 15,000 viral

733

reads for subjects to be included in the HRV+ highly infected group. Therefore, we

734

selected a cutoff of 15,000 viral reads for subjects to be included in the HRV+ highly

735

infected group (n=37) analyzed in Figure 6. All non-infected subjects (n=571), based on

736

the Virus Finder analysis described above, were used as comparison group for the

737

CoV+ and HRV+ groups.

738

In performing the CoV+ and HRV+ transcriptome-wide differential expression analyses,

739

to account for the class imbalance of this experiment, log2 count-normalized expression

740

values in units of counts per million (calculated using edgeR v3.28.0) were passed to

741

the function arrayWeights function in the limma55 R package (3.42.0). limma-voom was

742

then used to perform differential expression analysis on the count normalized

expression values between the CoV+ and uninfected groups, as well as between the

744

HRV+ and uninfected groups, controlling for age, gender, and asthma diagnosis status.

745

Genes were required to have an FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05, and an absolute log2FC

746

> 0.5 to be considered significant. Based on these cutoffs, genes were classified as

747

being shared if they were significant in both comparisons, or as CoV+–specfic or HRV+–

748

specific if significant in only one comparison.

749
750

Gene set enrichment analysis.

751

To investigate enriched pathways within WGCNA networks (see Figure 2a) or within

752

genes differentially expressed in CoV+ and/or HRV+ infected subject groups (see Figure

753

6c and 6c), we used Enrichr56 to test for gene overrepresentation of network genes

754

within a panel of annotated gene databases (Gene Ontology [GO] Biological Process

755

[BP] 2018, GO Molecular Function [MF] 2018, GO Cellular Component [CC] 2018,

756

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG] 2019 Human, and Reactome

757

758

tested for overrepresentation of network genes within gene marker sets (FDR < 0.05)

759

for each of 35 epithelial and immune cell types inferred using scRNA-seq of human lung

761
762

For the plots in Figure 6f-g, transcriptomic data for 11 flow sorted immune cell

766

the rest in order to obtain gene log2FC values for each cell type with which to rank order

767

the genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then used to test for association

768

between upregulated genes in the shared, CoV+–specific, and HRV+–specific gene sets

769

and each of the cell types, based on the cell type-specific ordered gene lists. GSEA was

770

carried out using the FGSEA R package (v1.12.0).

771
772
773

Canonical pathway analysis.

774

We used QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program (v01-16; content

775

version: 51963813, release 2020-03-11) to investigate canonical pathways and

776

upstream regulators that were significantly enriched in one or both of the upregulated

Analysis of scRNA-seq data from the nasal epithelial brushing

780

Initial processing of 10X scRNA-seq data, including cell demultiplexing, alignment to the

781

human genome GRCh38, and UMI-based quantification was performed with Cell

782

Ranger (version 3.0). Since the nasal brushing sample contains both epithelial and

783

immune cell populations that have distinct expression profiles (e.g.: Immune cell types

784

express far fewer genes compared to epithelial cell types), clustering and cell type

785

identification were done in two stages: 1) an initial clustering with a less stringent filter to

786

identify major epithelial and immune cell clusters was performed, 2) cells were

787

reclustered with different independent filtering criteria for epithelial and immune cell

788

types. All these analyses were performed using Seurat59 R package (v3.0).

789
790

In the first stage, we removed cells with fewer than 100 genes detected or cells with

791

greater than 25% mitochondrial reads. Additionally, to remove possible doublets, we

792

removed cells with higher than 6,000 genes detected and/or more than 20,000 UMIs.

793

Lowly expressed genes (detected in fewer than 4 cells) were also removed. We then

794

performed normalization using SCTransform60 and ran PCA on the top 5000 highly

795

variable normalized genes. Clustering analysis was performed on the top 20 PCs using

796

a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) based SLM61 algorithm with the following parameter

797

settings: resolution=0.8, algorithm=3. The single cell expression profiles were visualized

798

via embedding into two dimensions with UMAP62 (Uniform Manifold Approximation and

799

Projection), resulting in the identification of 11,157 epithelial cells and 229 immune cells

800

based on known cell type signatures.

801
802

In the second stage, we retained all the immune cells but removed epithelial cells with

803

fewer than 1,000 detected genes. After this filtering, a combined 8,291 epithelial and

804

immune cells were then normalized as in the first stage. Clustering analysis performed

805

on the top 30 PCs with parameters (resolution=0.4, algorithm=1, k.param=10) identified

806

15 clusters. We then ran differential expression analysis using a Wilcoxon test

807

implemented in Seurat’s “FindMarkers” function to help with cell type identification.

808

Based on these cluster marker lists, two clusters were merged into a single secretory

809

cluster, another two clusters were merged into a single ciliated cluster, and a final two

810

clusters were combined as “indeterminate,” based on the lack of defining marker genes

811

for these clusters. Through this merging process, we arrived at 8 epithelial and 3

Raw sequencing reads were trimmed using skewer with the following parameter

the human reference genome GRCh38 using HISAT263 (v2.1.0) using default parameter

settings. Gene quantification was performed with htseq-count using the GRCh38

expressed genes (those not expressed in at least two samples), we carried out

differential expression analyses between paired IL-13-stimulated and control samples

824

(N = 5 donors) and between paired HRV-infected and control samples (N = 5 donors)

against doublets, we removed all cells with gene or UMI counts exceeding the 99th

836

(2,715 IL-13-stimulated and 4,254 controls). After removing mitochondrial, ribosomal

837

(RPL and RPS), and very lowly expressed genes (expressed in < 0.1% of cells), we

838

integrated expression data from IL-13 and control cells using the dataset integration

839

approach in Seurat64. For the integration analysis, we used the top 30 dimensions from

840

a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based on SCTransform normalized expression of

841

the top 3,000 most informative genes across the two datasets, where “informativeness”

842

was defined by gene dispersion (i.e., the log of the ratio of expression variance to its

843

mean) across cells, calculated after accounting for its relationship with mean

844

expression. We then carried out principle component analysis (PCA) on the integrated

845

dataset and used the top 20 components for clustering and visualization. We used SNN

846

(Louvain algorithm, resolution=0.23, k.param=10) to cluster the integrated cells into 11

847

populations, which we visualized in two dimensions using UMAP (see Figure 3d). These

848

clusters were assigned cell type labels based their most upregulated genes, which were

849

identified by carrying out differential expression analysis between each cluster and all

850

others using Seurat’s logistic regression (LR) test, in which cell treatment was included

as a latent variable.
