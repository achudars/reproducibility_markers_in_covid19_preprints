Abstract
The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a serious health threat to
humans and a number of countries are already in the middle of the second wave of infection. There
is an urgent need to develop therapeutics against this deadly virus. Recent scientific evidences
have suggested that the main protease (Mpro) enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 can be an ideal drug target
due to its crucial role in the viral replication and transcription processes. Therefore, there are
ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that resulted in
hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand bound Mpro complexes in the protein data bank
(PDB) that describe structural details of different chemotypes of fragments binding within
different sites in Mpro. In this work, we perform rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of
62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their
interactions at atomic level. Using a total of ~2.25 µs long MD trajectories, we identified and
characterized different pockets and their conformational dynamics in the apo Mpro structure. Later,
using the published PDB structures, we analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of
small ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands
in the catalytic sites and other pockets in Mpro. Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket
in the catalytic site in Mpro that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also
highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in this lateral pocket towards ligand binding
and affinity against Mpro through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects
of explicit water molecules and Mpro dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus,
comprehensive molecular level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design
potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, main protease, novel coronavirus, molecular dynamics, in silico

Introduction:
The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (or SARS-CoV2), was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 20201 and as of October 27, this outbreak has
already caused over 43 million cases and 1.16 million deaths worldwide. While efforts for
developing a potent vaccine against this virus are occurring at an accelerated pace, there are
currently no clinically approved drug or vaccines to provide a cure or immunity from this deadly
virus. Furthermore, the rapid adaptive nature of the virus and its ability to mutate2–5 present new
challenges in developing effective novel antiviral therapy. Thus, understanding the specific drug
targets of SARS-CoV-2 6,7, clarifying its mechanism of virulence8,9, searching for a repurposable
drug and development of a small molecule drug10–14 or a vaccine15–17 against SARS-CoV-2 have
since been the main focus of scientific research.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded beta-coronavirus that
exhibits significant sequence and structure homology to that of the previous coronaviruses strains
such SARS-CoV-1 (generally known as SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV)1. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 shared
~79% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and ~50% similarity to MERS18. Much like the
previously identified coronaviruses, SARS-Cov-2 is composed of structural proteins that are
important in producing a complete viral particle, non-structural proteins that act as enzymes or
transcription/replication factors in the viral life cycle, and numerous accessory proteins19,20. The
structural proteins include the spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins, which have
been identified as targets in recent publications concerning SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery19,20.
There are 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,
helicase protein, papin-like protease (PLpro), and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (also known as the
main protease or Mpro)[3]. The two cysteine proteases, PLpro and Mpro, process most of the other
nsps. PLpro cleaves nsp 1 to 3 and Mpro cleaves nsp 4-16 of the polyprotein at 11 cleavage cites
14,21,22

.Amongst the other targets, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (or it will be interchangeably used with

Mpro in the text hereafter) remains as an attractive therapeutic target as its role of cleaving the
coronavirus polyproteins into functional components is vital for viral replication and
survival19,22,23. Inhibition of the Mpro can block proteolytic enzyme activity on polyproteins,
thereby, leaving a long peptide of polyprotein that is incapable of performing viral replication by
itself21,24. In addition, the Mpro is highly conserved among coronaviruses. For example, the amino

acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares >95% similarity with that of SARS-CoV Mpro
(sequence alignment provided in Fig. 1a). Therefore, there have been significant attraction towards
targeting Mpro to control SARS-CoV-2 and there are currently hundreds of crystal structures of
Mpro (either apo or in complex with ligands) reported in the protein data bank (PDB).
Based on the known three-dimensional (3D) structure (in Fig. 1b), Mpro is composed of
three domains including the N-terminal domain I (residues 1-101) domain II (residues 102-184)
and the C-terminal domain III (residues 201-301)25. As seen in the topology diagram of Mpro in
Fig. 1c, Mpro contains 13 β-sheets and 9 α-helices. domains I and II are mainly composed of
antiparallel β-sheets, with domain I having seven antiparallel β-sheets (labelled A through G) and
domain II consisting of the other six antiparallel β-sheets (labelled H through M in Fig. 1c). Unlike
these domains, domain III does not have any β-sheet and is composed of a cluster of five α-helices.
domains II and III are linked by a 17-residue long linker loop corresponding to the region PHE185THR201 (Fig. 1b). The binding site cleft is formed at the interface of domains I and II with
HIS41(from domain I) and CYS145 (from domain II) form a catalytic dyad26, which is unlike a
catalytic triad in other cysteine and serine proteases27,28. It is proposed that a water molecule at the
binding site plays the role of the third residue (in the catalytic triad) and is important in the catalytic
mechanism of SARS-COV-2 Mpro 25,29. A loop formed by CYS44-PRO52 in domain I and the
domains II-III linker loop encase the active site as shown in Fig. 1b. Under physiological
conditions, Mpro exists as a homodimer form, in which two monomers are placed in a perpendicular
orientation to each other. In this orientation, the dimer interface is formed by the domain II of the
first monomer particularly through residue GLU166 and the N-terminal residues of the second
monomer (generally called the “N-finger”)23 enclosing a contact surface area of ~1390 Å2 21 The
N finger from monomer 2 is critical as it closes the catalytic site in monomer A. Further, it is
proposed that domain II is crucial in modulating the formation of dimer interface in Mpro30.
Comparison of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro against the SARS-CoV-1 Mpro (in Fig. 1d),
show only amino acid variations in only 12 positions, which include THR35VAL, ALA46SER,
SER65ASN, LEU86VAL, ARG88LYS, SER94ALA, HIS134PHE, LYS180ASN, LEU202VAL,
ALA267SER, THR285ALA, ILE286LEU. With the exception of ALA46SER that is part of the
CYS44-PRO52 loop in domain I, all the other mutations are away from the catalytic site and
mostly on the surface regions on the three domains (Fig. 1b). However, as acknowledged by
Bzówka et al., despite the high degree of sequence identify between the Mpro in SARS-CoV-1 and

SARS-CoV-2, it is important to be mindful of the differences in the shape and sizes of their active
site and the potential impact of these 12 mutations25. The availability of high-resolution crystal
structures of Mpro has facilitated a number of in silico-based screening efforts to find suitable
molecules from known drugs18,31–33 (for drug repurposing) or from the natural product
libraries29,34–37. Apart from computational studies, the screening against Mpro was also carried out
through experimental approaches21,38–40. For example, a screening performed using the
fluorescence resonance energy transfer(FRET)-based enzymatic assay39 identified a number of
inhibitors such as boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XIII, and GC-376 that inhibited Mpro with
low micromolar IC50 values under the experimental conditions. Subsequently, the X-ray crystal
structure of Mpro in complex with GC-376 was also reported in the PDB (PDB: 6WTT). Another
structure-based design effort38 focussed on designing novel inhibitors from the chemical class of
peptidomimetic α-ketoamides and identified a number of compounds that exhibited nearequipotency against the alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses and enteroviruses when tested
against the recombinant proteases, viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures. Modifying a
specific amide bond in an inhibitor identified from this work38 into a pyridone ring resulted in a
novel α-ketoamide with improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., half-life of the inhibitor in
plasma)21. The crystal structure of this new α-ketoamide inhibitor in complex with Mpro was also
reported in the PDB (PDB ID: 6Y2F). One of the other significant researches against Mpro was
reported by Douangamath et al14, in which rigorous fragment screening against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
resulted in several crystal structures of Mpro in complex with several covalent and non-covalent
fragments. Most of the fragments screened were found to be bound within the catalytic site of Mpro;
however, a number of non-covalent fragments were bound at different other sites including the
dimer interface site. These fragment-bound Mpro crystal structures14 provide a wealth of
information about the ligand-Mpro interactions and also reveal several other cavities on the surface
of Mpro.
While a large number of experimentally resolved structures of ligand Mpro complexes are
emerging rapidly, it might be important and useful to understand the dynamic interactions of these
complexes and to garner any novel molecular level insights from the dynamic process. It is known
that molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool to study the dynamic molecular
recognition processes in biological systems such as ligand-protein and protein-protein
complexes41–45. Earlier, MD has been successful in the discovery of a novel cryptic binding trench

in HIV integrase enzyme46 that eventually led to the development of novel anti-HIV inhibitors
such as raltegravir. Therefore, in this work, we use MD to characterize the dynamic interactions
of almost all the crystal structures released as of June 10th, 2020 in PDB (the list is provided in
the supplementary Table, ST1) and evaluate their binding free energies using the end-point
molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach. This includes a total
of 62 ligand-bound complexes of Mpro, whose 3D superposed structure is shown in Fig. 2 and the
chemical structures of all the ligands are shown in supplementary Table, ST1. Due to the effective
use of computational resources, we initially studied all the complexes with a monomer of Mpro. It
should be acknowledged that it has been suggested earlier that Mpro could be inactive in the
monomer state23,30. However, since the activation process of an enzyme generally takes a much
longer time scale than the practical limits of classical MD approach, the simulation of ligand bound
to a monomer Mpro should be sufficient to capture the overall structural stability of the complexes
and evaluate their binding affinity through end-point methods. Nevertheless, we selectively resimulated the complexes with a dimer form of Mpro when the ligand is either initially bound at (or
at the proximity to) the dimer interface or when the ligand bound in the catalytic site unbound from
the site during MD simulation. Each complex was subjected to a 30 ns long MD simulation which
resulted in a total of ~2.25µs long MD trajectories. Our results highlight the significance of a lateral
pocket in the ligand-Mpro affinity and, in particular, the key role of HIS163 in this pocket through
computational mutagenesis. Further, we also calculated the binding free energy of the complexes
(with ligand bound at the catalytic site) in the presence of explicit water molecules so as to unravel
the effects of water molecules on the ligand-receptor affinity. Thus, our work should be useful to
further our knowledge about the interactions of reversible ligand-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes at
molecular level.
2. Computational methods:
2.1. Preparation of ligand-Mpro complexes for MD:
A total of 62 experimentally resolved crystal structures of reversible small molecule-SARS-CoV2 Mpro complexes (the list of PDB codes are provide in supplementary table ST1), along with the
crystal structure of an apo Mpro (PDB: 6M2Q), were retrieved from PDB. Initially, all the DMS
compounds, water molecules and ions were removed from the downloaded structures. For each

complex, the AMBERff14SB force field47 and the general AMBER force field (GAFF2)48 were
used for the protein and ligand, respectively. The partial charges of the ligand were assigned using
the semi-empirical AM1-BCC49 procedures in antechamber50. The missing ligand parameters were
obtained using the parmchk2 tools available within the AmberTools51. Subsequently, the ligandMpro complexes were prepared in using tleap program in AMBER18 package52 by solvating the
complex in a cubic box of TIP3P water molecules with a minimum of 12 Å distance between the
box boundaries and the closest solute atoms. The solvated systems where subsequently charge
neutralized with 150 mM concentration of NaCl counter ions. Thus, the systems were prepared for
subsequent MD simulation.
2.2. MD simulation of ligand-Mpro complexes:
All MD simulations were performed using the AMBER18 molecular dynamics program52 with
pmemd.cuda engine. MD simulation of each ligand-Mpro complex was performed in five
consecutive stages: (1) energy minimization, (2) NVT heating, (3) NPT equilibration, (4) NPT
pre-production simulation, and (5) production simulation. The initial stage of gradient
minimization of the system was performed in six rounds. In the first round of minimization, a
strong harmonic constraint of 100 kcal mol−1Å−2 was applied on the solute atoms and 10000 steps
of minimization (1000 steps of steepest descent minimization + 9000 steps of conjugate gradient
minimization) was performed. The next four rounds of minimization was performed with almost
same parameters as the first round except for the harmonic constraints that was reduced as
50>10>5 kcal mol−1Å−2 in each round. Finally, 20000 steps of energy minimization of the system
without any constraints was performed. Following the minimization, each complex was gradually
heated to 310K over a duration of 100 ps and, subsequently, equilibrated in four rounds, each being
400 ps long. In the first two rounds of equilibration, positional restraints were applied on the nonhydrogen atoms of the protein residues using restraint force constants of 5 kcal mol−1Å−2 (first
round) and 0.1 kcal mol−1Å−2 (second round). Following this, the third round of equilibration was
performed with a weak restraint of 0.01 kcal mol−1Å−2 applied to only the backbone atoms of
protein residues. Finally, a 400 ps long restraint-free equilibration of the system were carried
before proceeding to production simulation. The equilibrated system underwent a 2 ns long preproduction simulation under isothermal-isobaric (NPT) conditions. Following the pre-production
run, each complex was subjected to 3 subsequent 10 ns long MD simulation (making a total of 30

ns long MD simulation) using an integration timestep of 2fs. Throughout the simulation,
temperature was controlled using the Langevin thermostat53 and the pressure was kept at 1 bar
using the Berendsen barostat54. During the production runs, coordinates were stored every 2 ps
thereby resulting in a total of 15000 snapshots from a 30ns long MD trajectory. VMD 1.9.355 and
USCF Chimera56 were used to visualize the molecular dynamics trajectories. All simulations were
performed using the Graham and Cedar GPU clusters available within the ComputeCanada
infrastructure. The resulting MD trajectories of the ligand-Mpro complexes were processed through
the CPPTRAJ tool 57 to generate the root mean square deviation (RMSD) plots and the per-residue
root mean square fluctuation or RMSF (for the apo trajectories only).
2.3. Relative binding free energies of ligand-Mpro complexes:
Following the MD simulation, for each complex, the last 10ns of the MD trajectory was used to
compute the binding free energy scores between the ligand and the Mpro bound in a complex. For
this purpose, we employed the MM-GBSA method58 with the implicit solvent model of GB-Neck2
(or igb=8)59. The snapshots sampled at a regular interval of 10 ps and thus a total of 1000 frames
were used to calculate the MM-GBSA energies. The binding free energy (ΔGbind) using the MMPB(GB)SA can be estimated as,
∆𝐺!"#$ = ∆𝐸%% + ∆𝐺&'() − 𝑇∆𝑆

[1]

Here, ΔEMM is the summation of non-bonded and bonded interaction energies58. The solvation
energy, ΔGsolv, is the sum of the polar and non-polar contributions of solvation, where the polar
solvation terms are calculated using a Generalized-Born model or a Poisson-Boltzmann solver and
the non-polar terms are computed based on the size of the solvent accessible surface area in the
ligand and Mpro [58]. However, the last term corresponding to conformational entropy (TΔS) is
neglected as it is computationally expensive. It should also be noted that previous studies60,61 have
shown that incorporating the entropic contribution in the ΔGbind calculations do not assure accurate
binding free energy. Therefore, in this work, we calculate only the relative binding free energy,
which is often considered as useful in relative ranking of compounds. All MM-GBSA calculations
in this study were carried out using the MMPBSA.py script62 included in the AmberTools52. The
pairwise decomposition analyses (idecomp=4) using the MD trajectories were also carried out so

as to identify the key ligand-residue energetic contributors to the binding free energy of the
complexes63.
2.4. Relative binding free energies of ligand-Mpro complexes in the presence of explicit water
molecules:
The binding free energies of ligand-Mpro complexes were also calculated in the presence of 0-6
explicit water molecules. These calculations were performed using a MM-GBSA variant called
the NWAT-MMGBSA. Maffucci et al64 demonstrated that this NWAT-MM-GBSA method is able
to improve the correlation between the calculated and measured binding free energies of biological
systems. All parameters in the NWAT-MM-GBSA calculations were same as those explained for
the routine MM-GBSA method (section 2.3), except the explicit water molecules that were
captured from the MD trajectories using the CPPTRAJ tool57 of Amber 18 program52. The cpptraj
module was employed to select the desired number of snapshots and to generate the related
topology files for the free energy calculations; whereas, the interface residues were found using
the “InterfaceResidues” Pymol script. The NWAT calculation for each system was repeated by
increasing the number of explicit water molecules from 0 to 6. All NWAT calculations utilized the
shell scripts from Maffucci et al.64,65.
2.5. Preparation of mutated systems:
Each of the selected ligand-Mpro complexes were modified by a single point mutation of
HIS163 to ALA163 using the ‘swapaa’ command in UCSF Chimera56. The mutated systems
were then prepared and subjected to 30 ns long MD simulation as discussed in the above sections
for the wild type complexes (in sections 2.1-2.2). However, for the mutated systems, the relative
binding free energies were calculated only using the MM-GBSA approach (section 2.3) and the
free energies in the presence of explicit water molecules were not computed.
2.6. Preparation of ligand-bound dimer models of Mpro:
The models of ligand-bound Mpro dimer complexes were constructed using the experimentally
resolved 3D structure of a Mpro dimer in the PDB (PDB: 6WTT). This was performed by aligning
the ligand-bound Mpro monomer on the structure of Mpro dimer and the duplicate chain after
alignment was deleted to obtain the ligand-bound dimer complex. For example, we modeled the

dimer structure using the PDB structure of 5RFA, which represents a ligand-bound Mpro monomer
complex. This 5RFA structure was aligned against the chain A of the 6WTT structure and it is
expected that chains will be 100% aligned as they are essentially the structures from the same
sequence. After alignment, the bound-ligand from 5RFA was extracted into the dimer structure
(6WTT) and the protein chain of 5RFA was deleted. This resulted in a starting configuration of a
ligand-bound Mpro dimer complex. The same process was carried out to build all the 13 dimer
complexes in this study. All produces in building the dimer models were performed using the
UCSF Chimera. Subsequently, all the dimer complexes were subjected to 30 ns long MD
simulation and followed by binding free energy estimation using MM-GBSA method as described
above.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. MD simulation and analyses of apo SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
In order to understand the dynamics of a SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the absence of a bound ligand, we
performed 30 ns long MD simulation of an apo structure of Mpro downloaded from PDB (PDB ID
6M2Q). Initially, the stability of the structure was assessed by plotting the fluctuation of backbone
RMSD (Fig. 3a) during the course of MD simulation. It was noted that the backbone RMSD of
Mpro, as a whole, exhibited a fluctuation in the range of 1-3 Å, most often only varying within 0.5
– 1 Å. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, the RMSD plot showed a slightly increased fluctuation, reaching
~3 Å, around 14-15 ns timescale that was caused due to the movements of flexible C- and Nterminal loops. We analyzed the backbone RMSDs of the individual domains such as domain I-III
in Mpro(see in Supplementary Figure, S.Fig. 1) so as to deduce the dynamic segments. We found
that domains I and II remained quite stable throughout the simulation with backbone RMSD
changes within ~0.7 and 1.2 Å. Nevertheless, Domain III that features a globular cluster of five
helices exhibited fairly higher fluctuations that reached > 1.5 Å during the mid-course of
simulation and reaching a plateau during the last 10 ns. We performed RMSF analyses (Fig. 3b)
to reveal the averaged per-residue fluctuations during MD simulations. The most stable segments
of Mpro include the β-sheets in domains I and II, the loop connecting these domains (ASP92PHE112), and the helices of domain III. Unsurprisingly, the most flexible regions occurred at the
N and C terminus of the protein 45. In addition to this segment, the other regions that displayed
elasticity during MD were the loops connecting different secondary structures in domain III

(ASN277-THR292), domain II (ASP153-ASP155 and LEU167-VAL171), and domain I (THR45ASN65 and ALA70-VAL73). The loops enclosing the catalytic site in Mpro such as CYS44-PRO52
loop and the PHE185-THR201 linker loop (domain II-III linker) only exhibited small variations
indicating their role in stabilising the active site. The catalytic residues, HIS41(from domain I) and
CYS145 (from domain II) remained highly stable throughout the simulation. Despite the small
flexibility within the different loop regions, the apo protein structure proved to be quite stable and
only reached a maximum RMSD of 3 Å and a maximum RMSF of 2 Å. We also assessed different
electrostatic interactions in Mpro that contributed to the stability of the structure during MD
(Supplementary figure S.Fig. 2). We found strong hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between the
carboxylate side chain in THR111 and the hydroxyl moiety in ASP295 in domain II of Mpro (plot
shown in supplementary figure, S.Fig. 3a). In addition, we found stable salt bridge interactions
formed by two ASP-ARG residue pairs: one pair of salt bridge was formed between ARG131 in
domain II and ASP289 in domain III (supplementary figure, S.Fig.3b); and another pair of salt
bridge was established between ARG40 in domain I and ASP187 located in the DII-DIII linker
loop (supplementary figure, S.Fig.3c). These observations are consistent with the previous
studies66,67. In addition, we also identified a critical water-mediated interaction near the active site
of Mpro, where a central water-molecule formed a 3-way H-bond network with residues HIS41
(the catalytic residue), ASP187 and HIS164. We noticed that whenever the water molecule at this
tri-junction moved out of the binding site during MD, another water molecule entered the site and
maintained this H-bond network. This suggests the critical role of water molecules in the stability
of the binding site during MD simulation. Moreover, as indicated earlier, it is hypothesized that
this water molecule in the binding site could play a role of the third residue in regulating catalysis
process in Mpro[25,29].
Since, the 62 crystal structure complexes studied in this work show ligand binding at different sites
other than the actual orthosteric catalytic site in Mpro, we explored the dynamics of different
pockets in Mpro. A protein pocket detection tool, MDpocket68, was employed for this purpose.
Using the 30 ns MD trajectory of the apo Mpro, we sampled snapshots at a regular interval of 10
ps from the last 25 ns, thereby, using 2500 snapshots of the enzyme for the pocket analysis. Each
snapshot was saved as an individual PDB file and was used to determine favourable binding
pockets within the protein. In addition to the main binding site, many small and transient pockets
were identified using the putative channels and small cavities search options within MDpocket68.

Through this analysis, we identified a total of 8 pockets in Mpro monomer (Fig. 3c-d) that we
name as Pocket1-Pocket8 in the text hereafter. It should be noted that ligands binding in all these
pockets have been described in the PDB structures studied here. A table comparing different
characteristics of each of these pockets such as residues, pocket volume, and PDB codes of the
structures with ligand bound in the respective pockets are presented in the supplementary table ST.
2. The parameters used for MDpocket analyses are also provided in the footnote of this
supplementary table. Pocket 1 is obviously the catalytic pocket that is encircled by the loop
composed of PHE140-CYS145, a β-sheet (‘L’ in Fig. 1c) made of HIS163-GLU166, and the
residues from the domain II-III linker loop including HIS172, VAL186, ASP187, ARG188,
GLN189, and GLN192. The volume of this pocket was ~800 Å3 in our MD snapshots and, as
expected, most compounds in this study are bound in this pocket. Among the other pockets, three
pockets (including pockets 2, 3, 7) are found within the domains II and III, one pocket (pocket 4)
is found in domain I, and two pockets (pocket 5, 6) are found between domains I and II (Fig. 3cd). Pocket 2 is a small cavity (mostly volume < 320 Å3) that is found between domains II and III
and formed by the N-terminal (PHE3-PHE8) and C-terminal(PHE291-THR304) residues, along
with residues THR111 and GLN127 from domain II. In two of the crystal structures studied here,
5RFA (1-methyl-N-{[(2S)-oxolan-2-yl]methyl}-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) and 5RGQ (1-(4fluoro-2-methylphenyl)methanesulfonamide), ligands were found to bind at this pocket. Pocket 3
is another small and transient surface pocket formed by THR198 (from domain II-III linker) and
the selected residues from domain III (MET235 ASN238 TYR239 GLU240 PRO24). Fragments
such

as

2-{[(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)amino]methyl}phenol

(phenylmethyl)morpholin-2-yl]methanol

(PDBL:

5RGS),

(PDB:
and

5REC),

[(2~{R})-4-

(2R,3R)-1-benzyl-2-

methylpiperidin-3-ol (PDB: 5REE) were found to bind in this pocket. Similar to pocket 2, pocket
7 is another transient pocket that is mainly formed by residues from domain II (ARG105-PRO108,
MET130, PHE134, PHE181-PRO184) but is located near the interface between domains II and
III. It may be due to the transient nature of this pocket that only one carboxamide containing ligand
(PDB: 5REG) was found to bind in this pocket. Pocket 4, a fairly large pocket of 600 Å3, was
found to be formed majorly by the β-sheets composed of residues ASP34-TYR37, GLY79, HIS80,
SER81, LYS88-LYS90. This pocket remained stable throughout out MD simulation, which
suggests that this could be a viable pocket for ligand binding. In consistent with this, we found that
ligands (of different size and class) from at least 7 known crystal structures (5RFC, 5RH4, 5RE6,

5RE5, 5RGG, 5RFB, and 6YVF) were found to be bound in this pocket. Pocket 5 is slightly smaller
than Pocket 4 but is also quite stable throughout the MD trajectory. This pocket is positioned near
the catalytic site (or Pocket 1) between domains I and II, but on the opposite face of the protein.
Four ligands were found to interact with this pocket in the crystal structures (PDBs: 5REI, 5RED,
5RF5, 5RGR). Nevertheless, there is another large pocket of 800 Å3, Pocket 6, that is also found
between domains I and II and five ligands from the PDB structures of 5RF4, 5RFD, 5RE8, 5RF9,
and 5RFJ were found to be interacting at this site. This suggests the stable nature of this pocket
under experimental conditions, much like the behaviour observed during our MD simulation. In
addition to the well-defined pockets discussed above, we found a huge surface area (dubbed here
as pocket 8) of 2,250 Å3 that was found largely on the surface of domains 2 and 3 (Fig.3c) and
connecting many of the smaller cavities. There is only one crystal structure (PDB: 5RF0) that
describes the binding of a ligand within this surface. Mapping these residues onto a dimer structure
of Mpro (6WTT), we found that this surface is mostly buried at the dimer interface (refer to the
figure provided in the foot note of supplementary table, ST. 2), which explains the existence of
this dynamic surface area during MD analyses. However, since the dimerization in SARS-CoV-2
Mpro is crucial for the activity of the enzyme and thus the replication of the virus, this large surface
area of pocket 8 can be an interesting site for drug-binding, as targeting dimerization in Mpro23 is
considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit the virus replication.
3.2. Stability of ligand-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes during MD simulation
Following the analyses of pockets and their dynamics in the apo structure of Mpro, we performed
MD simulation and analyses of the selected crystal structures (supplementary table, ST. 1) in this
study. As described in the methods section, we performed 30 ns long MD simulation of each of
the 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes that resulted in a total of 1.86 μs long molecular
trajectories for analyses. We analyzed the stability of the protein and ligand structures using the
RMSD analyses. In order to simplify the data presentation, we calculated the average backbone
RMSD fluctuations of the proteins and the average RMSD fluctuation of ligand in each complex
during the course of MD simulation, which are provided in the supplementary table, ST. 3. As
can be seen in Fig. 4a, the average backbone RMSD variation of proteins in all the complexes were
mostly in the range of 1.5-2.3 Å, when compared to that of 1.81 Å for the apo (or ligand-free)
Mpro structure. This suggests that the binding of ligand had only limited impact on the structural

13

dynamics of the enzyme. Two PDB structures, 5RE5 and 5REG, were the only exception to this
trend and displayed slightly higher average backbone RMSD value of 2.84 Å and 2.87 Å,
respectively, which are still within the fluctuations that are usually seen for proteins of this size,
as also previously shown by a MD study66 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure. Analyses of their
trajectories showed that the PHE185-THR201 linker loop was slightly more flexible in these
complexes during the course of simulation. The flexible nature of this long loop connecting
domains II and III is already known66,69.
Nevertheless, unlike the stable proteins, ligands that were co-crystalized in the structures studied
here displayed a spectrum of behaviour that described their nature of stability and interactions with
the target. We initially analyzed the stability of the ligands bound within the HIS41-CYS145
catalytic binding site (or pocket 1), refer to Fig. 4b. It was noted that most of the ligands bound
within the catalytic binding site exhibited an average RMSD in the range of 1-6 Å. Lower the
RMSD value (i.e., < 3 Å) means the ligand was more stable in the initial pose (e.g., ligands in PDB
structures: 5RG1, 5RGW, 6W63, 5RH3); whereas, an average RMSD in the range of 3-6 Å
indicate that the ligand, despite bound stable in the catalytic site, underwent some conformational
changes to stabilize the association with Mpro (e.g., ligands in the PDB structures 5R7Y, 5R82,
5REZ, 5RH8, and 5RHD). For instance, in the 5RHD structure (in supplementary figure, SFig.4),
the 1-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]piperazine ligand was initially bound in a pose in which the
methylsulfonyl group was interacting with the “L” β-sheet residues such as MET165-LEU167 and
the piperazine moiety is stabilized by the H-bond interactions with CYS44- PRO52 loop that flanks
the catalytic site. Nevertheless, during the course of MD simulation (in the first 10 ns of simulation), the
methylsulfonyl group changed its orientation and interacted with the loop containing GLY143,

SER144 and CYS145. Thus, this change of binding pose of the ligand during MD simulation
resulted in a slightly higher RMSD range of over 4.5 Å. However, there were a few ligands that
bound within the catalytic site and had weak association with Mpro that resulted in their unbinding.
For instance, the smallest ligands in this study such as 1-azanylpropylideneazanium (in 5RF2) and
pyrimidin-5-amine (in 5RF3) that were originally bound within the binding site displayed weak
interactions with Mpro and egressed during the course of MD simulation. This explains the large
average RMSDs for these ligands (in Fig. 4b) during our MD simulation. Another ligand (~{N}[2(5-fluoranyl-1~{H}-indol-3-yl)ethyl]ethanamide) that was co-crystallized in PDB 5R7Z was
initially bound in a pose in which the fluroindole group was buried into the catalytic site and the

14

ethanamide group was projecting towards the surface of Mpro. However, during the course of 30ns
long MD simulation, this ligand explored different orientations within the catalytic site and
eventually unbound from the pocket. Similar behaviour was also seen in 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2pyridin-4-ylethyl)urea bound with Mpro in 5REH structure, where the pyridine ring was bound
inside the pocket and the cyclohexane moiety stuck outside on the surface that resulted in weak
interactions with Mpro and egression during MD. It should be noted that the current simulation of
ligand-bound complexes are based on the monomer state of Mpro. However, it is known that Mpro
exists as a dimer, where the N-terminus of the second chain will close the binding site of the first
monomer chain. Therefore, it is possible that 5R7Z could be a more stable ligand under a dimer
conformation. In order to address this concern, we analysed the dynamic interactions of the select
ligands with the dimer state of Mpro. These include the ligands that were originally bound within
the catalytic site of Mpro and unbound during MD. The results of these dimer simulation are
discussed in the later section.
Next, we analyzed the stability of complexes in which the ligands were bound in the other pockets
(pockets 2-8) found in the apo structure. The average RMSD of the ligands bound in these pockets
are

presented

in

the

supplementary

figure,

Two

ligands,

1-(4-fluoro-2-

methylphenyl)methanesulfonamide (5RGQ) and 1-methyl-N-{[(2S)-oxolan-2-yl]methyl}-1Hpyrazole-3-carboxamide (5RFA) were bound in pocket 2 composed of the N-terminal and Cterminal residues of Mpro monomer, which forms the dimer interaction surface. While the former
ligand remained stable throughout 30 ns long MD (average RMSD of 2.29 Å), the latter
disassociated during the course of simulation and displayed higher RMSD changes. Despite
pocket 3 between domains II and III is a small cavity, the ligands 2-{[(1H-benzimidazol-2yl)amino]methyl}phenol

(5REC)

and

[(2~{R})-4-(phenylmethyl)morpholin-2-yl]methanol

(5RGS) remained highly stable highlighting their complementing properties to this pocket through
H-bond interactions with TYR239 and GLU240 in this pocket (more discussion are presented in
the following section). Nevertheless, the piperidinol based ligand (in 5REE) was not able to make
such key H-bonds therefore unable to maintain stable interactions with pocket 3, which is reflected
by its average RMSD of 12.47 Å during MD. From the RMSD analyses, it is clear that the pocket
4 favours an acid group or its derivatives when compared to an amide or amine-based ligands. For
example, the ligands based on benzoinc acid (6YVF), propanoic acid (5RH4), and carbamate
(5RFC) exhibited stable interactions with this pocket. Nevertheless, the carboxamide-based

15

(5RGG and 5RE5), acetamide-based (5Re6) and ethanamine (5RFB) ligands remained loosely
bound to this pocket. It was interesting to note that all the ligands that bound to pockets 5 and 6
that are located between domains I and II displayed weak affinity towards this site, as all of them
unbound during the MD simulations. This suggests that this site is either not druggable or the
ligands explored in this screening do not have physicochemical features to complement this site.
Thus, our stability analyses highlight the stability and dynamic interactions of the experimentally
reported ligand-Mpro complexes.
3.3. Binding free energy analyses of ligand-Mpro complexes
In the earlier section, we discussed the stability of reversible ligands in different pockets in SARSCoV-2 Mpro structure. Building on these analyses, we calculated the binding free energy of the
ligand-Mpro complexes using the end-point MM-GBSA method based on the snapshots of the
complexes sampled from their respective MD trajectories. For each complex, we sampled the
snapshots at a regular interval of 10 ps from the last 10 ns trajectory, which resulted in 1000 frames
for the MM-GBSA calculations. The binding free energies of the complexes are provided in the
supplementary table, ST. 3 We also decomposed the ligand-residue pairwise energetic contribution
to the binding free energy of the complex. Our intention is to evaluate the binding affinity of the
ligand-Mpro complexes that were relaxed through MD simulations and identify the key residues
contributing to their affinity. As expected, the complexes in which the bound-ligand disassociated
in the course of MD (as discussed in the earlier section) displayed a low affinity of > -10 kcal/mol
that describes weak and non-specific interactions with the surface of Mpro during the simulation
(supplementary figure, SFig. 6). This is particularly true for the ligands bound in pockets 5 and 6
located at the junction of domain I and II, as these complexes did not show any stable interactions.
In the similar nature, those ligands that egressed from the catalytic pocket also had weak affinity
against Mpro and these include the structural complexes of 5REH, 5RF2, 5RF3, 5RF8 and 5R7Z
as discussed in the stability analyses. Fig. 5 compares the binding free energies of ligands bound
to pocket 3 (Fig. 5a) and pocket 4 (Fig. 5b). In pocket 3, the ligands, 2-{[(1H-benzimidazol-2yl)amino]methyl}phenol

(5REC)

and

[(2~{R})-4-(phenylmethyl)morpholin-2-yl]methanol

(5RGS), displayed a binding affinity scores of -17.56 kcal/mol and -14.79 kcal/mol, respectively.
Analysing their binding poses (in Fig. 5a), the alcohol (-OH) functional group in these compounds
bound inside the cavity and was stabilized by the hydrogen bond interactions with TYR239,

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.31.363309; this version posted November 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

GLU240 and MET235. Nevertheless, in the binding pose of the ligand ((2R,3R)-1-benzyl-2methylpiperidin-3-ol) that was bound to pocket 3 in Mpro (5REE complex), the phenyl ring was
occupying the cavity and the OH group in the piperidin-3-ol moiety was not able to make H-bond
interactions with the key residues in this pocket. Consequently, the ligand moved out of the pocket
3 during MD, thereby resulting in a poor affinity of ~-2 kcal/mol (in Fig. 5a). Earlier we noted that
pocket 4 favoured the binding of an acid group as opposed to the amide or amine-based fragments.
In consistent with this interpretation, the binding affinity scores of propanoic acid ligand (5RH4)
and benzoinc acid ligand (6YVF) were -17.50 kcal/mol, -15.35 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 5b).
Analyses of their binding poses show that acid groups in these ligands bury themselves in the
cavity. In this orientation, they are able to make electrostatic interactions (H-bonds) with the LYS
residues in the pocket (LYS88 and LYS90). Energy decomposition analyses revealed that the
pairwise interactions of the ligand with key restudies such as HIS80, SER81, LYS88 and LYS90
make significant contributions to the binding affinity of the complexes (Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, the
carbamate-based ligand in the 5RFC structure (Fig. 5b), a hydrophobic ring deep inside the pocket
but has a carboxy group that was placed on the edge of the pocket thereby allowing it to make
some electrostatic contacts with SER81 and LYS90. This pose was not favoured as a result, this
ligand displayed weaker affinity (-10.63 kcal/mol) when compared to the other acid-based ligands.
Nevertheless, the amide or amine compounds including carboxamide-based (5RGG and 5RE5),
acetamide-based (5Re6) and ethanamine (5RFB) ligands were not able to accommodate the cavity
in pocket 4, as a result they were not stable in the pocket and made several transient interactions.
The binding free energy scores in Fig.5b does not represent the ligand affinity to one site rather a
cumulative effect of interacting with different sites on the surface of Mpro during the course of MD.
Fig. 6a compares the binding free energies of the complexes in which the ligands were bound
within the catalytic site of Mpro throughout the simulation. From our analyses of MD trajectories
of these complexes, it was clear that the ligand bound in the active site (or pocket 1) was mainly
stabilized by their interactions with four segments, apart from the catalytic dyad residues, HIS41
(from domain I) and CYS145 (from domain II). These include (1) a loop (dubbed as ‘L1’)
connecting the J and K β-sheets leading to CYS145, shown as yellow in Fig. 6b, (2) domain II-III
linker (shown as green in Fig. 6b) composed of residues VAL186 through ALA193 and flanking
on the other side of the active site (dubbed as ‘L2), (iii) The ‘L’ β-sheet (see in Fig. 1c) that is
lining the active site and composed of residues HIS163-LEU167 (shown as blue in Fig. 6b), and

(iv) key hydrophobic residues surrounding the catalytic HIS41 such as LEU27 and MET49.
Depending upon how strongly the ligands engaged with these segments, their binding affinity
scores varied. For example, the ligand, 5-fluoro-1-[(5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)methyl]1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, was bound to the catalytic site of Mpro (PDB: 5RGH) and had a weak
binding affinity of -12.10 kcal/mol. Analyzing their trajectory, we found that the fluorine-attached
tetrahydropyridine ring was anchored to the ‘L1’ loop through the interaction of fluorine atom
with that of GLN189 and GLN192 residues (supplementary Fig, SFig. 7a). However, the other
methyl-attached thiadiazol moiety of the ligand remained flexible and underwent significant
conformational changes during MD (supplementary Fig, SFig. 7b). As a result of this fluctuation
in the ligand pose, the affinity of this complex remained low. In a similar nature, the ligands cocrystallized with Mpro in complexes 5R82 (6-(ethylamino)pyridine-3-carbonitrile), 5R80 (methyl
4-sulfamoylbenzoate), 5RHD (1-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]piperazine), 5RGK (2-fluoro-N-[2(pyridin-4-yl)ethyl]benzamide), and 5REB (1-[(thiophen-3-yl)methyl]piperidin-4-ol) were also
anchored to one of the four segments (in Fig. 6b) and remained dynamic within the catalytic
binding site. Therefore, these complexes had a binding affinity > -15 kcal/mol as seen in Fig. 6a.
For example, the conformational dynamics of the ligand, 6-(ethylamino)pyridine-3-carbonitrile,
in the 5R82 structure is clearly described in the supplementary figure, SFig. 8.
We noted that the ligands bound to the catalytic site and stabilized by the interactions with two of
the four segments described above exhibited a better binding affinity score that is < -15 kcal/mol
(in Fig. 6b). For example, the bulky compound in the series studied here is N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide

that

was co-crystallized with Mpro in the pdb structure 6W63. This compound was bound against Mpro
in a pose (in Fig. 7), in which the pyridine ring occupied a lateral cavity formed by the ‘L1’ loop
(yellow) and the ‘L’ β-sheet and formed a stable H-bond with HIS163 residue (Fig. 7c) in this
cavity. In addition, the OH groups in this ligand made strong H-bonds with GLU166 and GLY143
(refer to the 2D interaction diagram shown in Fig. 7d). In addition, the imidazole ring interacted
with HIS 41, and the methyl group attached to cyclohexamine moiety made hydrophobic contacts
with the ‘L2’ loop (i.e., the domain II-III linker loop). Pairwise decomposition of interaction
energies identified the key residues stabilizing this complex, which include HIS41, ASN142,
GLY143, MET165, and GLU166. The interaction of ligands with these key residues contributed
at least -3 kcal/mol energy to the binding free energy. Therefore, given the complementary

18

properties between the ligand and the protein in the 6W63 structure, this complex had a high
binding affinity score of -34.4 kcal/mol. Unlike the compound in 6w63 complex, the Nalphaacetyl-N-(3-bromoprop-2-yn-1-yl)-L-tyrosinamide ligand in the PDB structure of 5RG1 is a much
linear compound; yet, it displayed strong binding affinity of -36.30 kcal/mol towards Mpro.
However, similar to the former, the phenol group in this ligand also filled the lateral pocket (Fig.
8a) through H-bonds with the imidazole side-chain of HIS163 residue (Fig. 8c). In addition, the
ligand also formed two strong H-bonds with GLU166 (in Fig. 8c), and an addition H-bond with
GLN189. Decomposition analyses identified HIS163, MET165, GLU166, ARG188, GLN189 as
key energetic contributions to the binding free energy (Fig. 8b). Similar to these compounds,
several other pyridine-containing compounds exhibited similar interactions and possesssed a
binding affinity value better than -22 kcal/mol (Fig. 6a). These include (2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)N-(4-methylpyridin-3-yl)propenamide

(5RGX),

(5RH3),

2-(3-cyanophenyl)-N-(4-methylpyridin-3-

2-(3-cyanophenyl)-N-(pyridin-3-yl)acetamide

chlorothiophen-2-yl)-N-(pyridin-3-yl)acetamide
methylpyridin-3-yl)propenamide

(5RH3),

(5RGZ),

2-(5-

(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(4-

2-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(4-methylpyridin-3-

yl)acetamide (5RH2), 2-(5-cyanopyridin-3-yl)-N-(pyridin-3-yl)acetamide (5RGW), and N-(5methylthiophen-2-yl)-N'-pyridin-3-ylurea (5RH0). In all these compounds, the pyridine ring
occupied the lateral pocket and interacted with HIS163, whereas the linker group in their structures
made H-bond interactions with ASN142, GLY143 and GLN189. For example, the binding mode
of ligand-enzyme complex in the PDB structure 5RH3, the corresponding H-bond evolution plots
and energy decomposition graph are all provided in the supplementary figure SFig. 9. Unlike the
pyridine-based compounds, the ligand co-crystallized in the PDB structure 5RGV, 2-(isoquinolin4-yl)-N-phenylacetamide, also had a high affinity of -22.65 kcal/mol; nevertheless, in this
structure, it was an isoquinoline group that formed a H-bond with HIS163 and occupied the lateral
pocket. This shows that the lateral pocket is able to engage different moieties such as pyridine,
phenol and isoquinoline group.
The other molecules in Fig. 6 in the binding affinity range of -15 and -22 kcal/mol include ligands
that formed stable interactions with the ‘L2’ loop, ‘L’ β-sheet and also with ‘L1’ loop. However,
did not occupy the lateral cavity. For example, the 1-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2~{H}-quinoline-7sulfonamide ligand (in 5R81), interacted with the ‘L2’ loop through hydrogen bonds with GLN190
and GLY192, and with the ‘L’ β-sheet through via hydrophobic interactions with MET165 and

GLU166, in addition to the interactions with HIS41 (supplementary figure, SFig. 10). However,
this ligand did not engage with the lateral pocket and consequently had a weaker binding affinity
of -18.3 kcal/mol. In the similar nature, ligands including 5-(1,4-oxazepan-4-yl)pyridine-2carbonitrile (5RF6), N-[(4-cyanophenyl)methyl]morpholine-4-carboxamide (5REE), 2-(4methylphenoxy)-1-(4-methylpiperazin-4-ium-1-yl)ethenone (5RE9), N-(4-methoxypyridin-2-yl)2-(naphthalen-2-yl)acetamide (5RGY), and N-(2-phenylethyl)methanesulfonamide (5R7Y)
interacted with different segments within the binding site without occupying the lateral cavity and
all of them displayed weaker binding affinity toward Mpro. While our MM-GBSA analyses suggest
that ligand engagement with the lateral pocket in Mpro improves the binding affinity; however,
the ligand complex of 5RF7 was an exception. The ligand, 1-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-(1Hpyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)ethan-1-one, in this complex contains a pyrrolopyridine moiety that
indeed bound into the lateral pocket in the Mpro binding site and formed H-bonds with HIS163.
However, the methylpiperazine group on the other hand remained flexible and formed only
transient H-bonds with the key residues such as GLY143. ASN142 and GLU166 (supplementary
figure, SFig. 11). However, it can be noted that although this ligand did not make stable
interactions with the key residues in the catalytic pocket such as MET49, GLY143, SER144,
MET164, and GLU166 (Fig. 9b), it still had an affinity of ~-16.1 kcal/mol that was mainly due to
the stable engagement of the ligand with the lateral pocket in Mpro. Again, this highlights the
important role of the lateral pocket in the ligand Mpro interactions.
3.4. Steric water site analyses in the lateral pocket of Mpro
Since our MD and MM-GBSA analyses clearly highlighted the role the lateral pocket in the ligandMpro affinity, we analyzed the steric water site in the apo Mpro structure. This lateral pocket is
composed of residues ASN142, GLY143, SER144, CYS145, HIS163, HIS164, MET165, and
GLU166. Our analyses revealed that this pocket, in the absence of a ligand, was occupied by steric
water molecules (Fig. 9a). Next, we analysed the presence of this steric water in the lateral pocket
when a ligand was bound in Mpro. For example, in the PDB structure of 5RG1, the ligand occupied
the lateral pocket and the steric water site was then shifted to the edge of the pocket (Fig. 9a). This
displacement of water allowed the ligand to make stable interactions in the pocket and bind the
target with enhanced binding affinity. In the case of ligands that did not fully occupy the lateral
pocket, for example PDB 5RGH, the binding affinity was seen to be weaker and, now, the steric

20

water molecule site was again found centered within the lateral pocket (Fig. 9a). This site likely
favours the presence of an electronegative hydrogen bond forming moiety in whose absence the
space is occupied by a water molecule that substitutes this role. This evidence supplements the
significant role of the lateral pocket in ligand engagement and stronger binding energies.
3.5. Computational mutagenesis of HIS163 in the lateral pocket
Our MD, MM-GBSA and steric water site analyses clearly highlighted the importance of the lateral
pocket in Mpro, in particular the role of HIS163 in stabilizing the ligand-Mpro complexes. Therefore,
in order to evaluate this finding, we mutated HIS163 with ALA163 (called the HIS163ALA) in
the selected Mpro complexes and reperformed 30 ns long MD and MM-GBSA calculations as
carried out earlier for the wild-type (WT) complexes. For this mutagenesis calculations, we
selected five complexes (listed in the supplementary table, ST. 4) related to the PDB structures
5RGZ, 5RF7, 6W63, 5RG1, and 5RGX and mutated HIS163 with ALA163 in the protein structure
of each of these complexes. These ligand structures and their wildtype and mutated MMGBSA
binding affinities are shown in Fig. 9b. As can be seen in this figure and the supplementary table,
ST. 4, the HIS163ALA mutation caused an MM-GBSA difference of up to -9 kcal/mol. For
example, the PDB structure of 5RGX complex showed the greatest difference in binding affinity
with a decrease of -8.868 kcal/mol. In this complex, a methyl-attached pyridine ring was occupying
the lateral pocket. In the WT complex, shown in supplementary figure, SFig. 12, the nitrogen atom
of the pyridine ring formed a strong hydrogen bond with HIS163. GLY143, SER144, and CYS145
all formed electrostatic interactions with the double-bonded oxygen atom of the ligand, and
ASN142 and MET165 greatly contributed to the ligand’s binding affinity via Van der Waals
interactions. In the HIS163ALA mutant complex, the nitrogen atom was no longer able to form a
stable interaction with HIS163 (SFig. 12b), dropping the pairwise residue energy from -3.68
kcal/mol to -0.76 kcal/mol and enabling the pyridine ring to become much more flexible
throughout the trajectory. In additional to the HIS163 interaction loss, the 5RGX mutant complex
also lost its strong ASN142, GLY143, and SER144 interactions, instead formed transient contacts
with CYS145 and GLU166. This drastic change in pairwise residue contribution accounted for the
-8.868 kcal/mol loss in MM-GBSA binding affinity, as clearly shown in SFig. 12c.
The 5RGZ HIS163ALA mutant complex also showed a significant decrease in binding affinity.
This complex had an initial MM-GBSA of -27.6558 kcal/mol which was decreased by -5.582

kcal/mol in the mutated form. The ligand structure in the 5RGZ complex is very similar to that of
the 5RGX complex as previously described, with the absence of a methyl group attached to the
pyridine ring positioned in the lateral pocket (Supplementary figure, SFig. 13). Although these
ligands are very similar in their chemical structures, they behaved differently when subjected to
the HIS163ALA mutation. The 5RGZ mutant complex initially adopted a pose much like its WT
complex. During the first 15 ns of the MD trajectory, the pyridine ring was found well within the
lateral pocket. After 15 ns of simulation, the 5RGZ complex adopted a new pose in which the
pyridine ring moved significantly out of the lateral pocket to instead interact with LEU27, HIS41,
SER46, and MET49 (SFig. 13).
Complexes 5RG1 and 6W63 (the top MM-GBSA scoring complexes in this study) were also
mutated due to their initially strong binding affinities with MM-GBSA values of -36.3341 and 34.3563, respectively. The 5RG1 complex contained a phenol group in the lateral binding pocket,
where the oxygen atom formed a strong H-bond with HIS163. The 6W63 complex contained a
very large ligand, with a pyridine ring moiety located in the lateral pocket, as discussed earlier . In
addition to its strong interaction with HIS163, in the WT complex, the 5RG1 complex formed
stabilizing electrostatic interactions with GLU166 and GLN189. When the histidine residue was
mutated, the MM-GSBA binding affinity of the 5RG1 complex decreased by -4.172 kcal/mol. This
is attributed to the loss of the HIS163 interaction with the phenol group and GLN189 interaction.
In the mutated complex, GLU166 maintained its hydrogen bonds with the ligand, and formed an
additional, but transient, electrostatic interaction with the mentioned phenol group. This additional
interaction to stabilize the phenol group was seen in the pairwise decomposition graph in
Supplementary figure, SFig. 14 and also reflected in the slightly lessened decrease in MM-GBSA
binding affinity in comparison to other complexes such as 5RGX and 5RGZ. In the WT 6W63
complex, the pyridine ring moiety and nearby double-bonded oxygen atom formed strong,
electrostatic interactions with HIS163, ASN142, and GLY143. When mutated, the double-bonded
oxygen atom lost its stabilizing electrostatic interactions, and the HIS163 H-bond with nitrogen
pyridine ring atom was replaced by a H-bond with CYS145, decreasing the binding affinity of the
complex by -5.339 kcal/mol. This representation can be seen in Supplementary figure, SFig. 15.
Since the 6W63 ligand is a bulkly compound, the complex can be stabilized in the binding site and
lateral pocket by its other important electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions.

We also assessed the effects of mutation on the PDB complex of 5RF7 by building a HIS163ALA
mutant model. This complex has a unique 7-azaindole, double-ringed moiety that fits in the lateral
pocket. In theWT 5RF7 complex, this moiety formed stable H-bonds with both HIS163 and
HIS164. The rest of the ligand was unable to form lasting interactions with the protein residues
and oscillated between ASN142/GLY143 and GLU166. In the HIS163ALA mutant, although the
HIS163 bond was lost, the strong bond with HIS164 was maintained. In addition, the ligand was
positioned so that it interacted stronger with GLU166. The gain of this interaction is evident in the
residue decomposition graph in Supplementary figure, SFig. 16. Since the mutated 5RF7 complex
can maintain key, stabilizing interactions, specifically in the lateral pocket, its MMGBSA binding
affinity was only decreased by -1.076 kcal/mol. Therefore, our computational mutagenesis
analyses clearly demonstrate the importance of HIS163 and its role in ligand engagement in SARSCoV-2 Mpro.
3.6. Effects of explicit water molecules in the binding affinity of ligand-Mpro complexes
Our MM-GBSA analyses revealed several key interactions that contribute to the binding affinity
of the reversible ligands against Mpro. It is known that water molecules play an important role in
the catalytic process of Mpro in SARS-CoV-2, as also confirmed by our steric water site analyses.
Therefore, we analyzed the effects of explicit water molecules on the binding free energies of the
Mpro complexes, in which the ligand was bound within the catalytic binding site (or pocket 1). For
this purpose, we employed the NWAT-MMGBSA variant, as described earlier by Maffucci et al65
and explained in the methods section. We estimated the MM-GBSA energies with the presence of
0 to 6 explicit water molecules (noted as NWAT=0 to 6 in the text). The calculated NWAT-MMGBSA values for the complexes studied are provided as a polar plot in Fig. 10a and the
corresponding values are listed in the supplementary table, ST.5. In the polar chart (in Fig. 10a),
angular axis (along the circle) presents the PDB codes of the complexes studied; and the radial
axis (connecting the circle to the center of the plot) presents the binding affinity values in kcal/mol.
The MM-GBSA energies with no explicit water (i.e., NWAT=0) for the systems is the outer polar
line shown in blue. The MM-GBSA energies with the presence of (1 to 6) explicit water molecules
are also shown as data points connected by polar lines in different colors. For any given system, if
the presence of a water molecule enhances the affinity, then the polar data points for that system
is expected to move inside towards the center. Whereas, if the water molecule did not make any

23

impact, then the polar data points are expected to cluster at the same position. As can be seen in
Fig. 8, we noticed that most of the systems had the impact of explicit water molecules, except in
some cases. The complexes represented by the PDB structures 5RHD, 5R7Y, 5R81, 5RGZ, and
5RG1 clearly had a significant impact by the presence of explicit water molecules, as the data
points for these systems moved inward with the increase of each water molecule. This suggests
that the increase in binding affinity (lower MM-GBSA scores) with increasing numbers of waters.
For example, the maximum impact of water molecules on binding affinity was seen for the 5RHD
complex, where the MM-GBSA scores dropped by ~8 kcal/mol (from -13.63 for NWAT=0 to 22.09 for NWAT=6). Analyzing the structures (in Fig. 10b), it can be noted that the water
molecules bridged the bound ligand (1-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]piperazine) with CYS44 and
HIS41 residues during MD. The other water molecules were generally found engaging with the
sulfonyl and piperzine groups. Similarly, for the high affinity complexes such as 5RGZ and 5RG1,
the inclusion of explicit water molecules further enhanced their affinity towards Mpro (Fig. 10a).
As expected, the water molecules were found to stabilize the electronegative sites such as amide,
nitriles, or the hydroxyl groups in the ligands co-crystallized with these complexes (Fig. 10c-d).
In some other complexes such as these represented by the PDB codes 5RF7, 5RGK, 5RH8, 5RGV,
adding one of two water molecules helped to enhance the ligand-enzyme affinity; however,
addition of more water molecules did not make any more impact in the affinity. As a result, the
MM-GBSA scores for these complexes with NWAT >2 all cluster at one position suggested the
saturation in the number of water molecules that can engage inside the catalytic site of Mpro. Thus
our NWAT-MM-GBSA analyses suggest that upto 2 water molecules could play an important role
in the interactions of ligand-Mpro in the complexes studied in this work. Nevertheless, we were
also able to see that some complexes did not have any impact from the explicit water molecules
such as the complexes of 5RGX and 5RE9, as the ligand bound in these complexes were already
engaged in optimal interactions with the residues in the pocket, therefore, the water could not
contribute to the ligand-protein interactions (supplementary figure, SFig. 17).
3.7. Ligand interactions with a Mpro dimer
As we discussed above some of the ligands bound to the monomer form of Mpro did not exhibit
stable interactions in MD and egressed the protein during the course of simulation. It is now known
that Mpro is functional in a dimeric state, where the N-finger of the second monomer interacts with

24

the first monomer chain to close its catalytic site. Therefore, the natural question is if the ligands
egressed Mpro during our simulation where due to the absence of the involvement of the second
chain of Mpro. Therefore, in order to address this concern, we analysed the dynamic interactions of
the select ligands in the dimeric state of Mpro. These include the ligands that were originally bound
(1) within the catalytic site of Mpro and unbound during MD, (2) at the dimer interface of Mpro
(e.g., 5RGQ and 5RFA complexes), and (3) at the proximity to the dimer interface. Using these
selection criteria, a total of 13 complexes were selected for evaluation in dimer system. Fig. 11
presents the positions of all the selected ligands within a dimer structure of Mpro and the PDB codes
for the corresponding ligands are also marked in this figure. For each of the complexes selected,
we modelled the dimer model by aligning a ligand-bound monomer against the PDB structure of
a SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer (PDB 6WTT), and deleting an aligned chain of monomer. The
modelled ligand-bound dimer complexes were subjected to 30 ns long MD simulation and their
binding free energies were recalculated using the MM-GBSA method. The MM-GBSA scores of
the select complexes both under monomer and dimer conditions are compared in the
supplementary table, ST.6. We initially assessed the stability of the complexes, in which the
ligands were bound at the proximity to the dimer interface. These include 5RF1, 5RE8, 5RF9,
5RE7, 5RGJ,5REZ (refer to ligand positions in Fig. 11a). As can be seen in the supplementary
table, ST.6, the presence of a Mpro dimer does not increase the stability or affinity of these
complexes when compared to their respective monomer Mpro complexes. These ligands still
unbound from the dimer Mpro structures. This highlights the likely weak affinity of these ligands
towards Mpro. Subsequently, we analyzed the complexes, in which the ligands were originally
bound to the catalytic site (pocket 1) and subsequently egressed the monomer Mpro during MD.
This set of complexes includes the PDB structures of 5REH, 5RF2, 5RF3, 5RF8 and 5R7Z. Again,
as can be seen in the supplementary table, ST. 5, the engagement of the second Mpro chain through
its N-finger with that of the ligand-bound chain one Mpro did not help in improving the stability
and affinity of the most of these ligands. For example, the presence of the second Mpro chain did
not improve the affinity of the two smallest fragments bound at the binding site in the monomer
one of Mpro such as 1-azanylpropylideneazanium (in 5RF2) and pyrimidin-5-amine (in 5RF3). This
is not surprising given their small size. However, the only exception to this is the ligand 1cyclohexyl-3-(2-pyridin-4-ylethyl) urea (PDB: 5REH) in Fig. 12a, whose affinity towards a Mpro
dimer increased by ~-14 kcal/mol when compared to the monomer. The stability of the ligand with

the dimer over the monomer is described by the ligand RMSD fluctuation in both the states (in
Fig. 12b). Analyzing the MD trajectory of ligand-bound dimer complex, we noticed that the
binding of N-finger of the second monomer against the monomer A of Mpro closed the binding
site, thereby, pushing the ligand further into the binding site. In fact, the closure of the catalytic
pocket by the N-finger from the second Mpro chain pushed the pyridine ring of the ligand further
into the lateral pocket to establish the crucial H-bond interactions with HIS163 (in Fig. 12c).
Further, the amine groups in the ligand made stronger H-bonds with GLU166 (Fig. 11c) that helped
to improve the stability and affinity of this complex.
Finally, the ligands that benefitted the most by the presence of the Mpro dimer where obviously

pyrazole-3-carboxamide (5RFA), and [1-(pyridin-2-yl)cyclopentyl]methanol] (5RF0). While the
methanesulfonamide ligand (in 5RGQ) remained stable even within the monomer structure, this
was not the case with the other two ligands. Nevertheless, the presence of a dimer environment
assisted in the stability of these ligands and improved their binding affinity with Mpro significantly.
For example, the carboxamide-based ligand (in 5RFA) was bound at the interface of two Mpro
monomers (Fig. 13a) and remained stable throughout the course of MD simulation, which was not
true when it was bound with a monomer enzyme, as described by the ligand RMSDs in Fig 13b.
However, within the dimer form, the ligand underwent some structural changes around ~10 ns
during MD and remained in a much stable pose that was supported by the interactions of the ligand
with the key residues such as MET6, PHE8, ILE152, ASP298 from one Mpro monomer, and
predominantly SER123 from the other monomer (Fig. 13c). This pose is described by the 2D
interaction diagram shown in Fig. 13d. In a similar nature, the methanol-based ligand (in 5RF0)
also displayed enhanced affinity with the dimer when compared to the monomer form (refer to
supplementary table, ST. 5). The 3D structure of all the ligand-bound dimer complexes along with
their RMSD fluctuations in monomer and dimer states of Mpro are provided in the supplementary
figure, SFig. 18.
Since dimerization of Mpro is a crucial mechanism for the activity of the enzyme and hence the
replication of SARS-CoV-2 enzyme, there is an increasing interest towards disrupting the
dimerization of Mpro. Therefore, the molecular level interactions of the ligands at a specific pocket

present at the dimer junction identified through earlier X-ray crystal screening efforts70 and
currently studied through our efforts using MD and MM-GBSA analyses could be useful for
developing new compounds or identifying known drugs with physicochemical complementarity
to this site. Identifying such compounds will allow us to explore the widely acknowledged novel
approach of targeting the protease activity in SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
The novel coronavirus pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged as a huge
challenge for the 21st century. In less 10 months of outbreak, this infection has already caused over
46 million cases and 1.16 million deaths worldwide. Absence of a vaccine or a drug against this
virus remains a serious concern. The Mpro enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a potent
drug target as it plays a vital role in regulating the replication and transcription of the virus. With
consistent scientific efforts, several high-resolution 3D structures of ligand-Mpro complexes have
already been reported in the PDB and this number is rapidly growing. These structures offer useful
insights about the ligand interactions with Mpro and it is important to understand the dynamic
interactions of these complexes. In this work, we employed a wide array of computational methods
including MD simulation, binding free energy calculation using implicit and explicit water
molecules, pairwise decomposition of free energy, pocket analyses methods, steric water site
analyses and computational mutagenesis to present a comprehensive picture about ligand-Mpro
interactions at atomic level. We studied all 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes that were
published in the PDB as of June 10th, 2020.
Initially, we performed rigours MD and cavity analyses of the apo Mpro structure and identified
and characterized the conformational dynamic properties of 8 different pockets including the
known catalytic pocket (pocket 1). Ligands in the PDB structures studied in this work bound to
almost all of these sites, majority of the ligands were bound to the catalytic site though. Through
MD and stability analyses, we revealed that the ligands interacting in the catalytic site of monomer
Mpro in general remained stable, except for a few ligands that egressed the protein during MD.
We also identified that some ligands bound in the pockets 4 and 3 that are located in the domain I
and at the intersection of domain II and III, respectively, displayed some affinity and stability
during MD simulations. Nevertheless, all the ligands bound to pockets 5 and 6 were not stable and

egressed the binding site during MD simulation. This suggests that either the ligands do not have
suitable physicochemical complementary against the pockets or the pockets are not suitable for
ligand binding and modulation. Binding free energy analyses revealed that their affinities were
always better than the complexes with ligands bound in other pockets.
Through our analyses, we highlight four key components in the catalytic site of Mpro and the
binding of ligands with these elements determine their affinity to Mpro. In specific, we identified
a lateral pocket, featuring HIS163 as a key residue, which played a critical role in enhancing the
stability and the affinity between ligands and Mpro. We revealed that, in the absence of a bound
ligand, the steric water molecules occupied the lateral pocket to engage with HIS163.
Nevertheless, when the ligand binds at this site, the steric water moves away so as to facilitate the
binding of ligands to HIS163, which eventually increased the affinity of ligands to Mpro. In silico
mutation of this HIS163 to an alanine reduced the affinity of the ligand with Mpro, thereby
clarifying the importance of this residue in efficient ligand recognition by Mpro. Further, using
NWAT-MM-GBSA variant, we demonstrated that the presence of up to 2-3 explicit water
molecules can improve the affinity between certain ligands and the catalytic site in Mpro. Finally,
assessed the role of dimerization in Mpro for the binding and stability of some ligands. As widely
acknowledged, presence of a dimer might be important for binding certain ligands in the catalytic
site of Mpro, but not for all the ligands studied in this work. The ligands studied here were either
already stable in the monomer state or unstable in both monomer and dimer complexes. However,
a few set of ligands, particularly those bound at the dimer interface in Mpro, required the presence
of both the monomer chains to display stability. We discussed several key molecular dynamic
interactions of ligands binding at the dimer interface of Mpro.
In summary, our work has highlighted several key molecular determinants that are have critical
for ligand binding in Mpro including different pocket characteristics, role of water molecules in
the ligand-Mpro interactions, the importance of a lateral pocket and the key electrostatic
interactions rendered by HIS163 in this site, and molecular level details about ligand interactions
at the dimer interface in Mpro. These comprehensive molecular and mechanistic insights about the
crucial Mpro target could be useful to facilitate the identification of known drugs or the rational

Figure captions
Fig. 1: Sequence (a), structure (b), topology (c) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro along with the
comparison of its structure against SARS-CoV-1 Mpro(d). (a) SARS-CoV-2 Mpro share 96%
protein sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-1 Mpro, as indicated by Clustal x2 (2.1) multiple
sequence alignment. (b) A 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is shown with Domains I, II and III
colored in blue, red and yellow respective. Two important loops close to the catalytic dyad (HIS41
and CYS145) is shown in black: CYS44- PRO52 loop flanks the catalytic dyad and PHE185THR201 connects Domain II with Domain III. (c) A topology diagram showing the secondary
structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with β-sheets marked as A-M. (d) Structural alignment
of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and Sars-CoV-1 show only 12 mutations of amino acids that are shown as
sphere representation.
Fig. 2. The binding of 62 reversible ligands (shown as stick representation) on different sites
within SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (shown in Surf representation). Majority of the small molecules
bound within the catalytic dyad site (shown in circle) and the rest bind at different surface sites on
Mpro.
Fig.3. The backbone RMSD (a) and RMSF (b) fluctuations of apo Mpro (PDB: 6M2Q) and
the different pockets on the Mpro (c and d) identified through MD simulation. RMSD of the
apo structure changed between 1 – 3 Å during MD and the per-residue fluctuation during MD is
shown as RMSF and the different domains in the enzyme are marked. Using the “MDpocket” tool,
various transient pockets were identified and characterized within the apo structure during the MD
simulation.
Fig. 4. Average RMSD for the proteins in all the 62 systems studied here with reference to
that of the apo structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (a), and average unaligned RMSD of ligands
bound with the catalytic site in Mpro (b). (a) Protein backbone RMSD remain stable throughout
MD with exception of 2 peaks for PDB ID 5RE5 and 5REG. (b) Except for a few unstable ligands,
most of the other ligands remained stable in the binding site during the course of MD.

Fig. 5. The binding free energy of the ligand- Mpro complexes in which the ligands were bound
in pocket 3 (a) and in pocket 4 (b) along with their respective binding poses shown. Both in
pocket 3 and pocket 4, a few ligands remained stable due to their ability make key electrostatic
interactions with the residues in the pocket while the other ligands failed to make such interactions
that resulted in their weak affinity against Mpro.
Fig. 6. The scatter plot comparing the binding free energies of the ligand-Mpro complexes in
which the ligands were bound in catalytic site (a) and the identification of four key
components that are critical for ligand binding in this site (b). In (b), two loops flank the active
site pocket: the yellow loop made up of residues in the 140s range (called the L1 loop); and the
green loop that is part of the domain II-III linker Loop (called the L2 loop). In addition, the ‘L’ βsheet is shown in blue, and the residues such as HIS41, LEU27, and MET49 located deep inside
the pocket are shown as stick representation.
Fig. 7. The pair-wise decomposition analyses (a) for the binding mode of ligand in 6W63
complex (3) and its hydrogen bond interactions with the key residues in the pocket (3), along
with the 2D interaction diagram for the ligand-Mpro binding mode are shown. The
decomposition plot (a) identified the key residues such as HIS41, GLY143, GLU166 and HIS163
that contribute to the ligand-protein complex through stable H-bond interactions with the ligand
as shown in the H-bond evolution plots (c) and the 3D (c) and 2D (d) interaction diagrams.
Fig. 8. The binding mode of ligand in the 5RG1 complex within the catalytic site of Mpro (a),
the decomposition of key residues contributing to this ligand-receptor complex (b), along
with the time evolution of H-bond interactions of the bound ligand with residues such as
GLN189, HIS163 and GLU166 (c). The ligand occupied the lateral pocket in the catalytic site of
Mpro, where it formed stable H-bonds with HIS163 residue. This binding mode was supported by
other key residues such as GLN189 and 166.
Fig. 9. The identification of steric water sites in the apo and ligand-bound Mpro complexes (a)
along with the comparison of the binding free energy of the wildtype (WT) and HIS163ALA
mutant complexes of the select systems (b). (a) The presence of steric water molecules (shown

as yellow spheres) are found within the lateral binding pocket in the apo protein structure. When
a ligand is in position to occupy the lateral site, the steric water molecules are displaced to the edge
of the pocket, allowing for more stable ligand binding. Nevertheless, when the ligand does not
occupy the lateral pocket, the steric water molecules are again observed with this site. (b) Mutation
of HIS163 to an alanine (ALA163) clearly lead to weak binding affinity between the selected
ligand-Mpro complexes.
Fig. 10. A polar plot describing change in energy affinity with the presence of varying
numbers of explicit water molecules (NWAT=0 to 6) (a), and the different water interactions
with the ligand (b-d). Water bridge in 5RHD, water serve as proton donor to Mpro and proton
acceptor for the ligand (b). In 5RGZ and 5RG1, water forms 1 stable interaction with carboxamide
and hydroxyl side chain of the ligand to keep ligand within lateral pocket (c-d).
Fig. 11. A surface representation of a dimer model of Mpro (red surface is monomer 1 and
transparent surface is monomer 2) showing the interactions of ligands (shown as spheres)
that are bound at different sites at proximity to the dimer interface. The PDB codes of the
ligands are marked. The ligands binding at the dimer interface is marked by *.
Fig. 12. The binding of ligand from 5REH within a dimer model of Mpro (shown as surface
representation) (a) shown, along with the fluctuation of the ligand when bound with the
monomer and dimer (b) and the binding pose of the ligand within the dimer. The RMSD plots
describe that the ligand was unstable when bound to a monomer of Mpro; however, it was more
stable within a dimer condition. This is likely due to its favourable binding in the active site
containing pocket where the ligand made stable hydrogen bonds with HIS163 and GLU166 of
monomer B thus occupying the lateral pocket that was extensively explored by other ligands part
of our set (c). However, it is seen that the N terminal of the second monomer, specifically SER 1,
interacts in a hydrophobic manner, which indeed helped in the stable ligand interactions with Mpro.

the ligand within the dimer (d). The RMSD plots describe that the ligand was unstable when
bound to a monomer of Mpro; however, it was more stable within a dimer condition although it
unwent some conformational changes at ~10ns before reaching a pleateau indicating the stability
of the ligand after this point (b). The energy decomposition analyses (c) identified a number of key
residues from both the Mpro monomer chains to stabilze the ligand interactions, as described in
the 2D interaction diagram (d).
