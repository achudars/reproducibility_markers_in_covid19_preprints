Abstract: Effective presentation of antigens by HLA class I molecules to CD8+ T cells is
required for viral elimination and generation of long-term immunological memory. In this study,
we applied a single-cell, multi-omic technology to generate the first unified ex vivo
characterization of the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 across 4 major HLA class I alleles.
We found that HLA genotype conditions key features of epitope specificity, TCR α/β sequence
diversity, and the utilization of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive memory T cell pools. Singlecell transcriptomics revealed functionally diverse T cell phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T
cells, associated with both disease stage and epitope specificity. Our results show that HLA
variations influence pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and shape the immune repertoire
upon subsequent viral exposure.

Elicitation of a robust and durable neutralizing antibody response following immunization of
large sections of the population with approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is limiting viral
transmission and decreasing mortality, providing hope that the global threat from the COVID-19
pandemic is diminishing. However, the appearance of new viral variants warrants continued
vigilance. A more complete understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms that regulate
host immunity and guarantee long term protection is required. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads
to an upper respiratory tract infection, which can be benign or even asymptomatic. If not
controlled by the immune response, it can evolve into a lethal pneumonia with immunopathology
due to excessive amplification of the innate inflammatory response, complicated by several
extra-respiratory manifestations (1). While humoral responses play an important role in
immunological control of infection, the generation of effective cellular immunity and expansion
of cytotoxic CD8+ memory T cells is also required to eliminate virally infected cells as shown
from the earlier SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, even in the absence of seroconversion (2-7).
Several recent studies have focused on the discovery of relevant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, leveraging in silico predictions, stimulation/expansion with
peptide pools (8-18), and tetramer binding (19, 20). Collectively, these studies identified a
number of immunodominant epitopes derived across the viral proteome including structural and
non-structural proteins (8-20). Interestingly, some of these specificities were also detected in
uninfected individuals, suggesting potential cross-reactivity from endemic human coronaviruses
(HCoV) to which the population is routinely exposed (21), though a direct connection to preexisting memory cells has not been established.
The breadth and nature of the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is driven by
diversity in both TCR repertoire and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetics. Mammalian cells
express up to six different HLA class I alleles that shape antigen presentation in disease, and
allelic diversity has been associated with both disease susceptibility and outcome of viral
infections (22, 23). There are divergent reports regarding HLA polymorphism and COVID-19
incidence and severity, although the major GWAS studies clearly show no dominant effect of the
locus (24-28). Together with genetic influences on HLA-associated antigen presentation, the
clonal selection of T cell receptors (TCRs) that compose an individual’s repertoire contributes to
the nature and dynamics of the antiviral response, including cellular cytotoxicity and memory
formation. Interestingly, despite a potential TCR diversity of 1015 (29), several studies have
described “public” T cell responses in COVID-19, where complementarity-determining region
(CDR) sequences are conserved within and across individuals (18, 30). The extent to which TCR
diversity, especially in the context of epitope specificity restricted to HLA, contributes to
response is not well understood.
Here, we leverage a unique technology to elucidate, at single-cell resolution, the connection
between T cell specificity, HLA variation, conserved features of paired α/β TCR repertoires, and
cellular phenotype observed in CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We profiled
108,078,030 CD8+ T cells ex vivo across 76 acute, convalescent, or unexposed individuals, and
identified T cell specificity to 648 epitopes presented by four HLA alleles across the SARSCoV-2 proteome, few of which are implicated by the current variants of concern. Epitope2

specific TCR repertoires were surprisingly public in nature, though we found a high degree of
pre-existing immunity associated with a clonally diverse response to HLA-B*07:02, which can
efficiently present homologous epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs. Transcriptomic
analysis and functional validation confirmed a central memory phenotype and TCR crossreactivity in unexposed individuals with HLA-B*07:02. Our data suggest a strong association
between HLA genotype and the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2, which may have
important implications for understanding herd immunity and elements of vaccine design that are
likely to confer long-term immunity to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants and related viral
pathogens.

Direct ex-vivo detection and decoding of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells
We leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing with DNA-encoded peptide-HLA tetramers to
characterize CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 across multiple Class I alleles in subjects
with varying degrees of disease severity. The technology illustrated in Fig. 1a simultaneously
determines the specificity of paired α/β TCR sequences for HLA-restricted epitopes and
provides transcriptomic phenotype at single-cell resolution. We designed peptide-HLA tetramer
libraries to ensure comprehensive coverage of SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses
across four class I HLA alleles prevalent in North America (A*02:01, B*07:02, A*01:01, and
A*24:02, hereafter A*02, B*07, A*01, and A*24). Library inclusion was determined
computationally using predicted HLA binding (NetMHC-4.0 (31)) of candidate peptides from a
set of all possible 9-mers from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (40% from structural, 60% from nonstructural proteins), potentially immunogenic neopeptides from known SARS-CoV-2 variants,
and immunogenic epitopes from SARS-CoV-1. A total of 1,355 SARS-CoV-2 related epitopes
were included in the libraries in addition to well-characterized epitopes from common endemic
viruses (CMV, EBV, and influenza).
The peptide-HLA tetramer libraries were used to interrogate PBMCs from individuals who had
been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (N = 28 convalescent, N = 27 with acute disease that required
hospitalization), or who were unexposed (N = 23) as summarized in Table S1. For each
sample, CD8+ cells were isolated from PBMCs (Methods), incubated with HLA-matched
tetramer libraries, and sorted by flow cytometry to enrich viable, tetramer positive cells. Sorted
single cells were encapsulated with DNA-encoded hydrogel beads to provide cell-specific
barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that could be used to unify reads across
independent sequencing libraries for TCR, peptide-HLA tetramer, and mRNA (Fig. 1a). We
determined the specificity of TCRs using a classification method that identified UMI counts for
TCR-peptide-HLA interactions that were outliers when Z-score transformed within and across
cells for each sample (Methods). The resulting classifier was evaluated against functional assay
data for each allele by a receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis to identify thresholds, which
were then used for normalization. The normalized classifier evaluated by ROC analysis provided
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 (Fig. S1), and at a threshold of 1, which was applied to
the entire data set, yielded a true positive rate of 93% and a false positive rate of 32%.

From the 55,956,215 CD8+ cells interrogated from acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients,
we identified high-confidence TCR-peptide-HLA interactions across 434 immunogenic SARSCoV-2-derived epitopes and 1,163 independent α/β TCR clonotypes (Fig. 1b, Table S2). The
immunodominant epitopes we discovered ex vivo were consistent with those measured by other
means (8-20), but we also identified many epitopes with less dominant representation (yet
observed with two or more reactive clonotypes), 188 of which had not been previously reported
as minimal epitopes (Table S3). Importantly, CD8+ T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes
was observed across the entire proteome, generally distributed in a manner consistent with
protein lengths (Table S4). Of relevance, 85 of these epitopes were derived from the Spike
protein currently used in vaccines, but only six of them (a total of 20 CD8+ T cell clonotypes in
our study) would be affected by the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1) (Table
S5).
Dimensionality reduced projections of mRNA expression for 224,780 CD8+ T cells revealed the
broad phenotypic variance observed within this study spread across 8 clusters (Fig. 1c). We
defined the phenotypic features of clusters using gene signatures generally associated with
various CD8+ T cell states, including those with naïve, memory, effector, and proliferative status
(Fig. 1c). In this space, cells from convalescent patients that recognized different dominant
epitopes were commonly associated with divergent phenotypes, as shown for representative
epitopes in Fig. 1c. For example, T cells specific for QYIKWPWYI in A*24 (QYI-A24) were
clustered in regions with high effector scores while those specific for PTDNYITTY in A*01
(PTD-A01) and LLYDANYFL in A*02 (LLY-A02) resided at opposite ends of memory-rich
regions. Thus, and as will be further detailed below, the different immunoreactive epitopes of
SARS-CoV-2 elicit distinct CD8+ T cell phenotypes.

Evolution of immunoreactivity through COVID-19 disease progression
Having established a broad landscape of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells, we asked how
TCR repertoires evolve over the course of infection and recovery. As our approach does not
require cell expansion to determine TCR specificity, we were able to directly quantify the
frequency of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in the blood of convalescent, acute, and unexposed
individuals. Figure 2a shows the frequency, for each subject, of T cells reactive to the top five
epitopes detected across each of the four HLA variants analyzed. Notably, we observed
markedly fewer SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in patients with acute disease compared to those
in convalescence (p = 6.0e-7 for A*02, Wilcoxon rank-sum). The dramatic reduction also
applied to memory T cells from prior antiviral responses in these patients, including influenza
and EBV, but potentially less to the CMV-specific pool in multiple acute subjects (Fig. S2). The
paucity of virus-reactive T cells is consistent with the T cell lymphopenia that has been reported
to occur in patients with acute COVID-19 (1, 32).
We also observed that the frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in unexposed individuals
varied markedly with the HLA allele (Fig. 2a). While several dominant epitopes in HLA-A*02,
A*24, and A*01 were associated with high-frequency responses in >40% of convalescent
subjects (Fig. 2b), the depth of the overall response was significantly lower in unexposed
compared to convalescent individuals (p=2.3e-5, 2.2e-4, 1.1e-6 by Wilcoxon rank-sum,
respectively). In stark contrast, there was no discernible difference in response frequency
detected across the most immunodominant epitopes in B*07:02 individuals (p=0.2). In fact,

CD8+ T cells recognizing nucleocapsid-derived SPRWYFYYL in B*07 (SPR-B07) were found
in almost 80% of unexposed subjects with a mean frequency of 4 cells/M cells screened (Fig.
2b), presaging the immunodominance of this epitope in convalescent COVID-19 patients, where
reactivity was detected in 100% of the samples.

The broad presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in unexposed B*07 subjects could originate
from fortuitous cross-reactivity of a public specificity, or from priming via previous exposure to
a highly related endemic human coronavirus (HCoV). Indeed, SPR-B07 shows marked
homology to the corresponding segments of the nucleocapsid proteins from multiple prevalent
HCoVs, including HKU1 and OC43, with only a single amino acid residue mismatched at the Nterminus (Fig. 2c). The nature of the homology preserves internal TCR-contact residues as well
as the P and L anchors for HLA binding in peptide positions 2 and 9. Accordingly, the HCoV
epitope (LPR-B07) is predicted to bind with high affinity to HLA-B*07 and could reasonably be
expected to cross-react with SPR-B07-specific TCRs. Broader sequence alignment with HCoVs
revealed very little homology to the immunodominant epitopes of A*02 and A*01 but did
identify a perfect match to VYIGDPAQL for A*24 (VYI-A24). Surprisingly, T cell specificity to
VYI-A24 was not detected in a single unexposed subject. This likely reflects the lower frequency
of response elicited by this epitope or an insufficient commitment to memory following exposure
to HCoVs. Overall, we found that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is sharply distinguished by HLA
genotype, as can be seen clearly in the case of A*02 and B*07, where it appears that highly
specific CD8+ responses are either generated de novo or amplified from an abundant pre-existing
pool, respectively.
Functional reactivity and cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV2-specific clonotypes
To confirm the specificity and functionality of TCR-peptide-HLA interactions identified in this
study, we cloned several of the discovered α/β TCRs clonotypes and expressed them in the
TCR-null Jurkat J76 cell line (33). Activation of these transductants upon stimulation by SARSCoV-2 peptides, presented by an HLA-matched lymphoblast cell line, was evaluated by
measuring the induction of surface CD69 (Fig. 3a, Methods). Altogether, we validated 28
interactions for epitopes derived from Orf1ab, Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, and Orf3a
proteins, spanning high confidence interactions observed across multiple cells as well as
interactions observed exclusively in single cells (Table S6). Dose-response curves for a subset of
interactions in A*02 and B*07 are shown in Figure 3b. The EC50s measured for these
interactions ranged from 1 to 100 nM, with no particular relationship to epitope
immunodominance or clonotype frequency measured ex vivo from the respective subject. These
values are consistent with interactions measured for CMV-specific epitopes in A*02 using the
same system. We next used these recombinant TCR expressing cell lines to compare the
functional reactivity elicited by homologous epitopes from HCoVs (Fig. 3c). Activation was
insignificant for the closest homologs of Orf3a-derived LLY-A02 and Orf1ab-derived ALWA02, all of which actually originated from HCoV spike proteins. In contrast, HKU1 and OC43
homologs of nucleocapsid-derived SPR-B07 and KPR-B07 epitopes drove substantial T cell
activation (Fig. 3c).
We further assessed the sensitivity of B*07 interactions, comparing the reactivity of SPR-B07specific clonotypes identified from COVID-19 patients or unexposed subjects to SARS-CoV-2derived SPR-B07 or HCoV-derived LPR-B07 (Fig. 3d). The three TCRs identified from

COVID-19 individuals yielded EC50s that were essentially identical for the two epitopes, all
falling between 50-100 nM (Fig. 3d, left). Two of the TCRs from unexposed individuals yielded
EC50s in the same range, again comparable for the HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants, while a
third showed a >10-fold preference for the HCoV epitope (even though it was originally detected
as binding to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide). Aside from providing validation that the specificities
detected in our barcoded tetramer technology indeed correspond to antigen-reactive T cells, these
findings support that the homologies between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV epitopes are functionally
relevant, and that pre-existing cellular reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in B*07 subjects likely result
from previous exposure to HCoVs like HKU1 or OC43.

HLA Restricted SARS-CoV-2 Epitopes Impact V(D)J Gene Usage
Given the comprehensive landscape of TCR specificity determined with our approach, we sought
to elucidate the extent to which TCR usage is shared within and across subjects. We examined
the linkage between paired TCR α/β sequences and their epitope specificity to determine if any
features are implicated in the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2. We used TCRs from 2,469
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to perform network mapping of epitope-specific subsets across
several immunodominant epitopes identified (Fig. 4a). Importantly, because it is known that
during development, a TCR β-chain can be paired with many different α-chains, the network
analysis allowed clonotype linkages by α or β CDR3 sequences (indicated by edges), identifying
conserved motifs based on physicochemical similarity (via BLOSUM matrices) within in the
epitope specific T cell population (34). T cells from COVID-19 patients that recognize the most
dominant A*02-, A*24-, and A*01-restricted epitopes, which have no counterpart in unexposed
repertoires, showed a high degree of motif sharing with the exception of KLW-A02 (Fig. 4a).
Interestingly, all of these epitopes, including KLW-A02, show dominant usage of a single TCR
alpha variable (TRAV) region, and in the cases of QYI-A24 and PTD-A01, dominant usage of
both TRAV and TCR beta variable (TRBV) regions (Fig. 4b). In marked contrast, SPR-B07specific T cells, including those that also recognize homologs from HCoV, were far more diverse
in CDR3 across subjects (Fig. 4a), using 8 TRAV and 3 TRBV regions to cover 50% of the
clonotypes represented. We observed two instances of CDR3 homology shared across cohorts,
as indicated by the presence of nodes with unconnected edges, which are represented in both
network maps.
These comparisons show that the reactivities that appear during SARS-CoV-2 infection may
stem from both the amplification of highly related TCRs, or from the usage of diverse preexisting T cell populations. This conclusion extended to CDR3 lengths (Fig 4c), which were
tightly distributed for α− and/or β- chains in T cells reactive to the top epitopes in A*02, A*24,
and A*01, but significantly less so for SPR-B07. To further elucidate the extent of the public
nature of paired α/β TCR usage in COVID-19, we generated consensus sequences from select
interconnected network clusters (Fig. 4d). This representation provides insight into α/β linkage
in the context of public responses that cannot be afforded by bulk sequencing approaches. Most
motifs were represented by multiple sequences and shared by 50% of the subjects studied, with
the exception of KLW-A02 that was shared across only 22%, and SPR-B07 that was shared
across only 14%, notably with identical α/β sequences (Fig. 4d). Thus, we have observed
divergent TCR repertoire utilization, conditioned by HLA and the presence of diverse, preexisting reactivity resulting from prior viral exposure.

CD8+ Memory T cell Phenotypes vary with recognition of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes
To examine how CD8+ T cell phenotype varied in relation to disease status, HLA/epitope
specificity, and TCR diversity, we performed a more detailed analysis of the single-cell
transcriptomic data. We leveraged, as an internal reference, the transcriptomic phenotype of T
cells reactive to common acute and latent infections, including influenza, EBV, and CMV. To
relate these data to existing knowledge on differentially expressed genes that delineate CD8+ T
subsets, we used supervised partition clustering based on imputed expression (Methods) of a set
of 51 curated transcripts characteristic of naïve, memory, effector, or chronicallyactivated/exhausted populations (Fig. 5a). This resulted in the identification of seven distinct
cell clusters. Some were easily assigned (naïve cells in C1, central memory in C2, and fully
activated cytotoxic effectors in C7). Other memory/effector intermediates were more tentatively
labeled, as they did not easily fit into existing categorizations (35-37). These included a puzzling
population (C3, here “CD127+ Memory”), which expresses markers of naïve, memory and
effector cells, and 3 other clusters with characteristics of memory or chronically activated cells
(C4-6).
SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells were found in all clusters (Fig. 5b, bottom), but at proportions that
varied with stage of disease and epitope specificity (Table S7). Cells from acute patients
predominantly showed effector phenotypes, but also paradoxically naïve types. In convalescent
donors, T cells from several epitope specificities were broadly distributed, consistent with the
resolution of an infection. Several epitope-specific T cell pools were predominantly found in
central memory (C2), including PTD-A01 (49%) and LLY-A02 (42%), while others
predominantly resided in the cytotoxic terminal effector cluster (C7), including TLM-A02
(80%), and LLL-A02 (61%). In most other reactivities, including SPR-B07, transcriptional
profiles in convalescent patients were fairly broadly distributed across all clusters. In contrast,
the reactivity in unexposed subjects was dominated by the central memory pool, confirming that
the CD8+ cells likely result from long-term exposure to cross-reactive antigens. This was
especially clear in the case of B*07, where epitope-specific T cells for SPR-B07, QPG-B07, and
SII-B07 were represented in central memory (C2) at proportions of 88%, 75%, and 67%,
respectively. Other notable reactivities associated with central memory include TSQ-A24 (70%)
and NSS-A01 (68%), though the source of these memory cells, like QPG-B07 and SII-B07, does
not appear to be from HCoV exposure based on a lack of homology. Overall, this analysis
provides further evidence that SPR-B07 responses to SARS-CoV-2 are likely drawn from a preexisting memory pool and that commitment to different cell fate is dependent on epitope
specificity.
We also observed some interesting dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 infection and existing T cell
pools specific for common viral infections, with differentiated outcomes likely shaped by
exposure history (Fig. 5b). Influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, which result from vaccination or
past infections, mapped primarily to the central memory (C1) and effector memory (C3)
compartments in unexposed individuals. Proportions were stable across epitope specificities in
COVID-19 patients with the exception of GIL-A02, where the proportion of effector memory
cells decreased from 50% to 0% and a naïve population representing 30% of the cells
paradoxically emerged. CMV- and EBV-specific T cells, likely subject to more chronic
stimulation from low-level re-activation of these integrated herpesviruses, mapped to more
activated pools in unexposed subjects, as has been described by others (38). After SARS-CoV-2

infection, EBV-specific cells shifted markedly from central memory (C2) and chronically
stimulated compartments (C5) into the 127+ memory cluster (C3). These changes may reflect
either bystander activation, perhaps as a result of the high cytokine release in COVID-19
patients, or from changes in homing or recirculation patterns that bring into the blood cells
normally sequestered in tissues. These observations suggest that, in addition to inducing
lymphopenia, COVID-19 strongly reshuffles third-party antiviral T cell pools, the extent of
which may be associated with exposure history and, at least to some degree, epitope specificity.
Discussion

Here we presented the first unified description of the CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2,
highlighting the importance of HLA genetics, TCR repertoire diversity, and epitope-specific
navigation through a complex transcriptomic phenotype at various stages of disease. In building
a comprehensive map of immunodominant, HLA-restricted epitopes broadly derived from
proteins across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we highlight how only some HLA haplotypes
are associated with the existence of a pre-existing CD8+ T cell memory pool in unexposed
individuals. We further show how HLA variation plays an important role in shaping the diversity
of CD8+ T cell repertoires upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and that cellular phenotype and
commitment to memory can be associated with epitope-specificity in the context of both SARSCoV-2 and latent EBV infections.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells has been linked to milder disease (5, 11,
12), although the precise link between cellular immunity and host protection still remains to be
further understood (7, 39, 40). We found that individuals carrying HLA-B*07 show a CD8+ T
cell response that is dominated by pre-existing memory pools reactive to multiple SARS-CoV-2
epitopes, especially SPR-B07, which is likely induced by previous exposures to benign HCoVs.
In contrast, the immunodominant responses in A*02 individuals (e.g. to YLQ-A02, LLY-A02)
are driven largely by the expansion of antigen-inexperienced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. It is
interesting to note that CD8+ T cell cross-reactivity may be less widespread in unexposed
individuals than for CD4+ T cross-reactivity, for which ~50% of unexposed individuals exhibited
CD4+ T cell memory (16). Our data provides a basis for this limited representation of the CD8+ T
cell repertoire in that only a subpopulation of individuals carrying a specific HLA allele would
have these pre-existing memory CD8+ T cells.
The interplay between HLA-restricted epitope presentation and available TCR repertoire shapes
the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. There are few limited studies suggesting an influence of
HLA genotype on COVID-19 severity (27, 41-43). Large-scale, high-resolution HLA mapping,
consistent with what we have done for select HLAs in this work, may help identify relationships
between HLA genotype and protection against severe disease, ideally uncovering mechanism.
Here, we observed an interesting connection between TCR repertoire diversity and HLA
restriction. Responses seen in A*02, A*24, and A*01 were more often associated with “public”
CDR3 motifs and consistent V gene segment usage in the α− and/or β− chains. In contrast, the
dominant immune response in B*07 leveraged a significantly more diverse TCR repertoire.
Several contributors to public TCR responses have been proposed, focusing on the
physicochemical features of HLA-restricted peptides (e.g. “featureless” peptide-HLAs may drive
a public response) and convergent recombination of TCR dimers (44). The method described in
this work provides an ideal system to address this question. Perhaps counterintuitively, our

results show that in the case of COVID-19, the largest pool of potentially protective, pre-existing
cellular immunity is derived from one of the least public epitope-specific repertoires, possibly
reflecting the influence of repeated acute infections with HCoVs throughout the life of the
individuals.

Beyond the comprehensive deciphering of TCR specificity reported here, we also provided a
detailed picture of the complex and dynamic transcriptional landscape of the CD8+ T response to
SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we were able to demonstrate that the pre-existing SPR-B07
reactivity, observed in ~80% of unexposed subjects with HLA-B*07, was predominantly
associated with a central memory-like transcriptional profile (88%), confirming that it originates
from prior exposures. In convalescent patients, we observed a much broader distribution of SPRB07-reactive T cells spanning every functional state at proportions ranging from 5-29% (Table
S7). This is consistent with late contraction/early memory formation described for SARS-CoV-2
in a recent study (12), where cells spanned naïve, central memory, various classifications of
effector memory, and terminally differentiated effector memory expressing RA (TEMRA). There
was no evidence for a particularly frequent “exhausted” state among SARS-CoV-2-specific
CD8+ T cells, as suggested elsewhere (45, 46) (acknowledging that the phenotypic state is a
proxy for true reactivity testing, and that blood T cells may not fully reflect what happens in the
lung). We also did not find evidence of “antigenic sin” resulting from HCoV pre-exposure (47)
that would stifle an effective response to SARS-CoV-2-unexposed B*07 individuals. It will be
interesting to determine whether HLA haplotype plays a role in the durability of the CD8+ T cell
responses, especially to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which may have profound impact for long term
protection across different ethnic groups and geographic regions.
Another interesting observation from this work, as noted by others (48), is that even at the height
of infection or shortly after viral clearance, the cumulative anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell
response barely reached the frequency of anti-influenza memory responses and was well below
the frequencies that could be achieved by CMV-specific cells in the same individuals (Fig. S2).
This was particularly evident in the acutely infected individuals, at a time where the contribution
of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would have been most important. We acknowledge the caveat that
peripheral frequencies were measured, and some degree of sequestration in viral target tissues,
such as the lung, is likely to occur in acute patients. Yet, the response seems much more muted
than the “all hands-on deck” observed in some other viral infections (49). This meager outcome
was seen both for the cross-reactive “secondary responses” by memory T cells pre-primed by
endemic HCoVs, as well as for the primary responses of truly SARS-CoV-2 species-specific
CD8+ T cells amplified de novo. This suggests that the paucity likely does not result from a
blocking of primary activation, but from a dampening of all specific CD8+ T cells. Consistent
with this notion, frequencies of influenza/EBV/CMV reactive cells were also lower in acute
COVID-19 patients, compared to SARS-CoV-2 “naïve” individuals. It has been proposed that
the lethal cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 stems from innate immune functions
overcompensating for adaptive immune system failures (2). In this line of reasoning, one might
propose that SARS-CoV-2’s noxiousness stems from a broad obstruction of antiviral CD8+ T
cell responses. We have recently described a “super-Treg” phenotype in severe COVID-19, with
heightened expression of FoxP3 and Treg effector molecules, akin to tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells (50), and one possible interpretation is that overactive Tregs are overly suppressing these
CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 patients.

Given the widespread lymphopenia observed in acute COVID-19, we pondered the possibility of
latent virus reactivation with the loss of protective CMV- and EBV-specific T memory pools.
While we have no direct evidence of impact on disease outcome, we do see a significant
alteration of cell state within these subsets. While CMV-reactive cells remained within, though
somewhat shuffled, the same effector/memory transcriptional phenotypes between unexposed
and COVID-19 cohorts (including chronic stimulation, cytotoxic terminal effector, and terminal
effector memory), we observed a dramatic shift of EBV-specific cells from chronic stimulation
and central memory into the interesting “127+ memory” state in COVID-19-exposed individuals.
These cells expressed moderate to high levels of many naïve (IL7R, SELL, CCR7), memory
(GZMK), and effector-associated genes (NKG7, CST7, GZMA), along with markers of
activation/exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3), making them particularly interesting and difficult to
ascribe to conventional phenotype labels. Recently, two new transcriptionally distinct stem-like
CD8+ T cell memory states were described, one of which was functionally committed to a
dysfunctional lineage (37). As these cell states were differentiated by many of the same markers
observed in our “127+ memory” compartment, it would be interesting to see to what extent these
“127+ memory” cells, dominated by EBV-reactive pools, experience similar fates of dysfunction.
We speculate that this phenotype may be a consequence of the particular inflammatory milieu of
COVID-19 patients.

In conclusion, we leveraged a powerful single-cell technology to better elucidate the roles of
HLA variation, TCR diversity, and cellular phenotypes in establishing pre-existing immunity to
SARS-CoV-2. We observed the presence of a diverse and immuno-dominant nucleocapsid
epitope-specific memory pool in subjects with HLA-B*07 but saw little evidence of similar
reactivity in individuals with other HLA alleles. Outside of the HLA-B*07, the epitope-specific
TCR repertoires observed were largely public in nature. We measured a diverse landscape of T
cell phenotypes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also observed an influence on T cell
repertoires reactive to persistent and latent infections with other viruses. Overall, this work
provides a framework for the unified characterization of the cellular response to novel viral
infections. The ability to understand the basis of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and other
pathogens will provide insight for the continued assessment of immune surveillance, health
security, and long-term protection from future respiratory pathogens.

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and related common cold coronaviruses (HCoV) epitopes. Mismatches
are represented in red and HLA anchor residues with a grey background. Green arrows indicate
sequences where anchor and all internal residues are conserved between SARS-CoV2 and HCoV species.

Fig. 3. Functional confirmation of identified epitope/HLA interactions with clonotypic
TCRs and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with common cold coronaviruses. (a)
Schematic showing lentiviral transduction of clonotypic recombinant TCRs (rTCRs) into J76
cells, loading of antigen presenting cells (APC) with synthetic peptide, and quantification of
activated J76 cells expressing surface CD69. (b) Dose-response curves for TCRpHLA interactions observed across several canonical epitopes in A*02:01 and B*07:02
backgrounds. Shown are fractions of CD69(+) cells after a 16-hour stimulation. (c) Functional
activation of TCRs by canonical and homologous epitopes, represented as fraction of CD69(+)
cells after 16-hour stimulation with 10 μM peptide. (d) Dose-response curves for
several rTCRs from COVID patients (left) or unexposed subjects (right) stimulated with peptides
from SARS-CoV-2 or HCoV HKU1/OC43.

Fig. 4. Analysis of TCR sequences from cells specific for the most immunodominant
epitopes for each HLA allele tested. (a) Network plots showing biochemical similarity
of TCRα or TCRβ CDR3 regions in unexposed subjects (left) or COVID-19 patients
(right). Unique subjects are identified by node color. Each node is a unique clonotype within a
subject, and the size of the node represents the relative frequency of the response detected. Edges
drawn between nodes represent CDR3 homology, and the size of each node represents relative
cell frequency. (b) TCRα or TCRβ (V) gene usage across all sequences represented in (a) with
the most frequently used gene labeled. (c) Distributions of CDR3 lengths. (d) Paired CDR3
motifs for the most interconnected nodes identified in the network analysis (a).

Fig. 5. Transcriptomic clustering of T cells based on function-specific gene sets. (a) Single
cell gene expression heat map of single CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2, CMV, EBV,
Influenza, or with no observed (N.O.) specificity. Units are ln(TP10K)(51). Kmeans clustering
identified seven distinct clusters showing gene expression consistent with a range of functional
states. (b) Ticks indicate the location and cohort assignment of individual cells with specificity
for epitopes from SARS-CoV-2, CMV, EBV, influenza or no observed (N.O.) specificity. (c)
Gene expression of single cells with individual epitope specificities indicated in the heat map. In
cases where specificity was detected in the unexposed cohort, pie charts are shown to indicate
the fraction of cells corresponding to each cluster identified in (a).
