Abstract

20

The pandemic outbreak and rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome

21

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not only a threat for humans, but potentially also for many

22

animals. Research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have been transmitted

23

from animals to humans and vice versa, and across animal species, and hence, attracted public

24

attention concerning host-virus interactions and transmission ways. Non-human primates (NHPs),

25

as our evolutionary closest relatives, are susceptible to human viruses, and a number of

26

pathogens are known to circulate between humans and NHPs. Here we generated global statistics

27

of virus infection in NHPs (VI-NHPs). In total, 121 NHP species from 14 families have been

28

reported to be infected by 139 DNA and RNA viruses from 23 virus families; 74.8 percent of

29

viruses in NHPs have also been found in humans, indicative of the high potential for cross

30

species transmission of these viruses. The top ten NHP species with high centrality in the

31

NHP-virus network are two apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus), seven Old World monkeys

32

(Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, Papio cynocephalus, Lophocebus albigena, Chlorocebus

33

aethiops, Cercopithecus ascanius, C. nictitans) and a lemur (Propithecus diadema). Besides apes,

34

there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and Old World monkeys, given the wide

35

distribution of many Old World monkey species and their frequent contact with humans. We

36

suggest epidemiological investigations in NHPs, specifically in Old World monkeys with close

37

contact to humans, and other effective measures to prevent this potential circular transmission.

Introduction

43

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

44

(SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread worldwide, and recent studies suggest that pets and other animals

45

could also be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through natural contact [1, 2]. Captive rhesus macaques (M.

46

mulatta), inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 in pathological studies, exhibited a moderate infection as

47

observed in the majority of human cases [3, 4]. Besides captive animals and pets, wild animals are

48

also susceptible to the infection of coronaviruses transmitted from humans. For instance, in 2016,

49

wild chimpanzees in Côte d´Ivoire were infected by the human coronavirus OC43 [5].

50

The close evolutionary relationship between humans and NHPs is thought to support pathogen

51

transmission [6] and many viruses have been described that circulate between humans and NHPs.

52

In captive and wild NHPs, various viruses including coronaviruses, enteroviruses, enteric

53

adenoviruses, rotaviruses, and picobirnaviruses have been detected, which are also found in

54

humans [7–9]. The most prominent cases of virus transmission from wild NHPs to human are

55

simian foamy virus (SFV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and human

56

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10–13]. Conversely, viruses such as poliovirus and measles have

57

been reported in NHPs and likely derived from local human populations [14]. To block the

58

potential circular transmission route of different viruses between human and NHPs, precautions and

59

regulations are needed.

60

Here we performed a survey on documented virus infections in NHPs (VI-NHPs) based on

61

published data. First, we generated a summary statistics of worldwide reported VI-NHPs. We then

62

identified and predicted NHP species with a high risk of virus transmission from humans and

63

predicted geographic locations where disease outbreaks are likely to occur.

66

Materials and Methods

67

Global information of VI-NHPs was extracted from the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD,

68

http://www.mammalparasites.org/). We also used literature searches for publications describing

69

VI-NHPs, which were not included in GMPD. Only the natural virus infections in captive and wild

70

NHPs have been recorded, while the virus inoculations for pathological studies are not included.

71

We then built host-virus ecological networks in which nodes represent NHPs that are linked

72

through shared viruses. Since centrality in primate-virus networks could assess the potential for the

73

circulation of viruses among NHPs and humans, we estimated the centrality using four metrics:

74

strength degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality

75

implemented in the R package “igraph” and UCINET 6.689 [15]. Since each metrics presents

76

different and complementary aspects of centrality, we tested the correlations among all four

77

centrality indices. To obtain a clearer picture of the effect of centrality of each NHP species on

78

transmission ability, we obtained a composite centrality that integrates the different and

79

complementary aspects of the four centrality metrics by performing a principal component analysis

80

(PCA) on the centrality index correlations [13]. The phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS)

81

methods were used to test the relationship between centrality and the number of viruses reported in

82

each NHP species, and the number of viruses in each NHP species that are also found in human

83

[13,16].

84
85

Results

86

In total, 1,435 records of VI-NHPs were obtained from the GMPD. Forty-three additional

87

publications describing VI-NHPs, not included in GMPD, were integrated into the overall database.

88

Thus, our final dataset contained 1,478 records, describing infections caused by 139 different

89

viruses in 121 NHP species (14 families, 49 genera) globally (Figures 1a and 1b). The viruses

90

infecting NHPs covered DNA and RNA viruses from 23 families: Adenoviridae (20 viruses),

91

Herpesviridae (17), Flaviviridae (15), Bunyaviridae (14), Retroviridae (13), Paramyxoviridae (10),

92

Togaviridae (9), Picornaviridae (8), Polyomaviridae (4), Caliciviridae (4), Rhabdoviridae (4),

93

Filoviridae (3), Orthomyxoviridae (3), Reoviridae (3), Poxviridae (2), Papillomaviridae (2),

94

Coronaviridae (2), Picobirnaviridae (1), Parvoviridae (1), Astroviridae (1), Hepadnaviridae (1),

95

Anelloviridae (1), and Arteriviridae (1) (Figure 1c). Among the 139 viruses reported in NHPs, 104

96

viruses (74.8%) were shared between human and NHPs, indicating the high zoonotic potential of

97

these viruses.

98

The most documented VI-NHPs occurred in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, 44 viruses;

99

Figure 1d), but viruses were detected in all apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorillas and orangutans) and

100

94.4% of them have also been reported in humans. The second most documented VI-NHPs are

101

found in the rhesus macaque (43 viruses; Figure 1d), of which 33 are shared with humans. Besides

102

apes, Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae) are with 70 (44.0%) infected species the most infected

103

group among NHPs. Among other NHP families infected species range from one to ten (3.1- 42.1%,

104

Figure 1b).

105

We obtained a weighted unipartite NHP-virus network, in which each node represents a NHP

106

species connected to other nodes by the edges weighted by the number of shared viruses (Figure

107

2a). All four centrality indices showed positive correlations (0.625 < r < 0.989, P < 0.0001 in all

108

cases, n = 121 NHPs; Table S1), indicating that they detected similar NHP species as most central.

109

A single factor found in PCA explained 85.2% of the variance of the indices, which was used as the

110

composite index to assess the centrality of each node (Table S2). The top ten most central NHP

111

species include two apes, seven Old World monkeys and a lemur, in descending order: Pan

112

troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus, Papio cynocephalus, Macaca mulatta, Lophocebus albigena,

113

Chlorocebus aethiops, Cercopithecus ascanius, Propithecus diadema, Macaca fascicularis, and

114

Cercopithecus nictitans (Figure 2a and 2b).

115

After controlling for phylogeny, virus number in each NHP species and the number of viruses

116

shared with humans in each NHP species were significantly and positively associated to the

117

centrality of each NHP species (strength degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness

118

centrality, closeness centrality, and the composite centrality; Figure 2c and 2d, Table S3 and S4),

119

respectively. This indicates that the centrality of a primate in the NHP-virus network could reflect

120

the level of potential risk of virus transmission between NHPs and humans (and among NHPs).

121
122

Discussion

123

Assuming that areas containing many NHP species and species evolutionary closely related to

124

humans are more likely sources of zoonoses than areas containing fewer and more distantly

125

related species, it was hypothesized that forests of central and western Africa represent areas

126

where zoonotic outbreaks are likely to occur [17, 18]. Our study supports this hypothesis and

127

suggests that African Old World monkeys (P. cynocephalus, L. albigena, C. aethiops, C. ascanius,

128

and C. nictitans) exhibit a high potential for the circulation of viruses among NHPs and humans

129

based on the centrality evaluation of our NHP-virus network. Interestingly, based on our statistics,

130

the Asian rhesus macaque is the NHP species with the most reported virus infections. Rhesus

131

macaques are, besides humans, the world’s most widely distributed primates, occupying a vast

132

geographic distribution spanning from Afghanistan to the Chinese shore of the Pacific Ocean and

133

south into Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam [19-22]. Furthermore, long-tailed macaques

134

(M. fascicularis) are distributed over large parts of the Southeast Asian mainland and the

135

Sundaland region between ca. 20°N and 10°S [23]. The network analyses shows the high

136

centrality of these two macaque species in the NHP-virus network and ranked them among the

137

top ten most central NHPs. Given the wide range of both macaque species, the centrality of

138

macaques in the NHP-virus network and the frequent interface with humans (Figure 3a and 3b),

139

there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and macaques.

140

A major drawback of our study might be uneven and incomplete data as only few wild NHP

141

populations have been thoroughly sampled. Since our statistics are based on documented

142

VI-NHPs, records on virus infections are likely to be more complete and extensive for

143

well-studied compared to less investigated NHP species. Centrality may also be affected by the

144

number of studies on each NHP species, because more thoroughly sampled NHP species seem to

145

have more confirmed virus infections [24]. However, there are also more interfaces between

146

thoroughly studied NHPs and humans, which might lead to a higher probability of potential

147

transmission. Thus, we did not control for the sampling effort in above analysis. For the sake of

148

preciseness, we used the number of citations (=number of studies) as an estimate of sampling

149

effort for each primate, including sampling effort in the computation of centrality estimates by

150

upweighting the least sampled primates and down-weighting the most sampled primates [13].

151

Results showed the some trend with the analysis without controlling the sampling efforts, and for

152

the sake of brevity we provide results in the supplementary metarials (Table S5-S9 and Figure

153

S1). In the future, more efforts ought to be made for the collection, documentation and analysis

154

of VI-NHP, especially for NHP species with higher potential of virus transmission. Since

155

coronaviruses have been reported in macaques and other primates [7, 8], viral surveys should

156

first target such species, not only to find known coronaviruses in such populations, but also to

157

find new strains with high zoonotic potential.

158

Experts in animal health and conservation are starting to urge for the protection of great

159

apes during human COVID-19 pandemics, since the transmission of the human virus to apes

160

could result in severe outbreaks and local extinctions [25]. We suggest to expand such efforts to

161

various Old World monkeys, as many of them, for instance, baboons or macaques, are widely

162

distributed and often in close proximity to humans (Figure 3a, 3b and 3c). Moreover,

163

bioinformatics analysis indicate that Old World monkeys, besides humans and apes, are more

164

likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than New World monkeys or strepsirrhines [26] and the

165

rhesus macaques were most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other Old World

166

and New World monkeys [27]. Based on the centrality evaluation of our NPH-virus network,

167

several Old World monkeys are considered to be at great risk of cross-species transmission due to

168

the high centrality in the network. Since the distributions of Old World monkeys, apes, and

169

humans often overlap, monitoring and regulations ought to be issued to block this potential

170

circulative transmission route for the protection of NHPs. Especially macaques are widely used

171

animal models with large captive populations almost all over the world [28]. Moreover, many

172

wild Old World monkey species are in close contact with humans in national parks and even in

173

urban districts (Figure 3a, 3b and 3c). Based on the above, route surveillances are necessary for

174

captive and wild Old World monkey populations in frequent contact with humans.

Figure 2. (a) Unipartite weighted network depicting the pattern of shared viruses by NHPs. Each

278

node represents a NHP species. The links between nodes depict shared viruses (i.e., two

279

nodes/species are linked whenever they share a virus). NHP species in the center of the network

280

share more viruses than species on the periphery. The size of the nodes is proportional to the

281

number of virus infections. (b) Composite index of centrality (PC1) of each NHP species in the
