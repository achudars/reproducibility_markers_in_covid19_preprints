ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is a global health issue with unprecedented
challenges for public health. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, via binding
human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2)1,2, and infection can result in pneumonia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome. Circadian rhythms coordinate an organisms response to its environment
and recent studies report a role for the circadian clock to regulate host susceptibility to virus infection3.
Influenza A infection of arhythmic mice, lacking the circadian component BMAL1, results in higher viral
replication4 and elevated inflammatory responses leading to more severe bronchitis5,6, highlighting the
impact of circadian pathways in respiratory function. We demonstrate circadian regulation of ACE2 in
lung epithelial cells and show that silencing BMAL1 or treatment with the synthetic REV-ERB agonist
SR9009 reduces ACE2 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry and RNA replication. Treating infected
cells with SR9009 limits viral replication and secretion of infectious particles, showing that post-entry
steps in the viral life cycle are influenced by the circadian system. Our study suggests new approaches
to understand and improve therapeutic targeting of COVID-19.
Circadian signalling exists in nearly every cell and is primarily controlled by a series of
transcription/translation feedback loops. The transcriptional activators BMAL1 and CLOCK regulate
thousands of transcripts including their own repressors, REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ, that provide a
negative feedback loop to control gene expression (Fig.1a). To investigate a role for circadian pathways
in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle we initially assessed whether infection was time-dependent in synchronised
Calu-3 lung epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.1). Infecting Calu-3 cells at different circadian times (CT)
with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1b) showed a rhythmic pattern of viral replication (Fig.1c). To assess whether this
was mediated at the level of virus entry we used lentiviral pseudoparticles (pp) expressing the SARSCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and showed time-dependent infection (Fig.1d). We showed that SARS-CoV2pp infection of Calu-3 cells was dependent on Spike-ACE2 interaction by blocking virus uptake with a
receptor mimic (ACE2-Fc) or by neutralizing infection with anti-Spike mAb FI-3A (Supplementary Fig.2).
Pseudoparticles bearing the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein infected the cells with
comparable efficiency at all time points (Fig.1d). These data uncover a role for circadian-signalling
pathways to regulate Calu-3 epithelial cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 uptake.
Since ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) co-regulate SARS-CoV-2 internalization1,2
we measured their expression in synchronised Calu-3 cells. ACE2 protein levels varied over 24h, with the
trough (CT6) and peak (CT18) of expression associating with SARS-CoV-2pp entry (Fig.2a). In contrast,
TMPRSS2 expression was similar at all time points sampled (Fig.2a). The classical model of circadian
regulation is one of transcriptional control, however PCR quantification of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
transcripts showed no evidence of a rhythmic pattern in Calu-3 cells (Fig.2b), consistent with posttranscriptional regulation of ACE2. To extend these observations we quantified Ace2 and Tmprss2
transcripts in lung, liver and intestine harvested from light/dark entrained mice and observed limited
evidence for a circadian pattern of expression (Supplementary Fig.3). Immunoblotting of ACE2 in the
murine lung resulted in multiple bands of varying molecular weight, compromising the interpretation of
these experiments. To further explore the role of circadian pathways in regulating ACE2 we shRNA
silenced Bmal1, the major circadian transcriptional activator, and showed reduced ACE2 expression but
a negligible effect on TMPRSS2 in Calu-3 cells (Fig.2c). To assess the impact of Bmal1 on SARS-CoV-2pp
entry we infected the silenced Calu-3 cells and showed a significant reduction in pp infection, whereas

VSV-Gpp infection was unaffected (Fig.2d). During the COVID-19 pandemic several Spike variants have
emerged; some conferring a fitness advantage to viral entry. D614G, has become prevalent in many
countries, consistent with a reported fitness advantage for infecting cells of the upper respiratory
tract7,8. SARS-CoV-2 Spike has a unique furin cleavage site that mediates membrane fusion and deletion
of this motif has been observed both in vitro9 and in animal models of infection10. Importantly, pp
containing either Spike variant showed reduced infection of Bmal1 silenced Calu-3 cells (Fig.2d). In
summary, these data show a circadian regulation of ACE2 that significantly impacts SARS-CoV-2 entry.
The availability of a synthetic agonist (SR9009) that activates REV-ERB and modulates circadian
pathways11,12 prompted us to investigate its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treating Calu-3 cells with
SR9009 reduced BMAL1 promoter activity and protein expression, with no impact on cell viability
(Supplementary Fig.4). SR9009 treatment reduced ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect
on TMPRSS2 expression (Fig.3a). Importantly, SR9009 inhibited SARS-CoV-2pp infection in a BMAL1dependent manner (Fig.3b). As expected from our earlier results, VSV-Gpp infection was insensitive to
SR9009 treatment (Fig.3b). SR9009 was equally effective at limiting entry of pp bearing the D614G or
Furin-KO Spike variants (Fig.3c). Using an independent pseudoparticle system based on VSV1, we showed
that SR9009 treatment of Calu-3 (Fig.3d) or VERO cells (Supplementary Fig.5) reduced particle infection.
To extend our observations to a more physiologically relevant system, we showed that treating primary
bronchial epithelial cells with SR9009 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2pp infection (Fig.3e). SARS-CoV2 Spike binding to ACE2 can induce formation of multicellular syncytia13-15 and we established a realtime assay to measure cell-cell fusion16. Treating target cells with SR009 reduced both ACE2 expression
(Fig.3f) and Spike driven cell-cell fusion (Fig.3g). In summary, these demonstrate that REV-ERB agonists
repress ACE2 expression and limit SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-cell fusion.
BMAL1 and REV-ERB regulate gene expression by binding E-box or ROR response elements (RORE),
respectively, in the promoter and enhancer regions of their target genes17,18. A genome-wide CRISPR
screen identified 153 host factors that are important in SARS-CoV-2 infection19 and bio-informatic
analysis20 identified 144 canonical E-box motifs ’CANNTG’ and 80 ROR response elements ’RGGTCA’ in
these genes (Fig.4a). Furthermore, analysing murine transcript data from BMAL1 ChIP-seq21 and REVERB knock-out animals22 identified putative target genes and suggested that ~30% of SARS-CoV-2 host
factors are BMAL1 or REV-ERB targets (Fig.4a), suggesting a role for circadian pathways in SARS-CoV-2
RNA replication. To test this hypothesis we validated our earlier pseudoparticle data with an authentic
viral replication system and demonstrate a significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria 01/20 strain)
replication in Bmal1 silenced Calu-3 compared to parental cells (Fig.4b). Furthermore, SR9009 treatment
significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication, assessed by intracellular RNA and the secretion of
infectious particles (Fig.4c). These observations were recapitulated with VERO cells (Supplementary
Fig.6). To define whether circadian pathways regulate post-entry steps in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, we
evaluated the effect of SR9009 on viral replication when added before or after virus inoculation. The
agonist reduced viral RNA levels under both conditions (Fig.4c), leading us to conclude that both SARSCoV-2 entry and replication are circadian regulated.
Our studies show circadian regulation of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells and show striking inhibitory effects
of BMAL1 silencing and the synthetic REV-ERB agonist SR9009 treatment on ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV2 entry and virus replication in lung epithelial cells. Of note, SARS-CoV-1 and alpha NL63 also require

ACE2 to enter cells23 and our data support a role for circadian factors in regulating the infection of these
related coronaviruses. The human Ace2 promoter encodes putative binding sites for BMAL1/CLOCK and
REV-ERB, however, we did not observe binding of these factors by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR
in Calu-3 cells (Supplementary Fig.7). In addition, there was no evidence for rhythmic expression of Ace2
transcripts in Calu-3 or in the lung, liver or intestine from entrained mice, consistent with bio-informatic
analyses of published diurnal/circadian datasets from baboons24 and mice25. These results are consistent
with recent studies showing a role for post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms in
regulating the circadian clock26-28. There is an emerging role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating the
circadian clock29,30 and miRNAs have been reported to regulate ACE2 expression31, providing a possible
post-transcriptional mechanism. Our studies show ACE2 to be a rhythmically ‘moving’ target and this
could be relevant for evaluating new treatments targeting this step in the viral life cycle.
In addition to the circadian regulation of ACE2-mediated viral entry, we observed a marked suppression
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and genesis of infectious particles following SR9009 treatment and in Bmal1 silenced
cells. Our bio-informatic analysis suggests that 30% of SARS-CoV-2 host factors are potentially
BMAL1/REV-ERB regulated, highlighting a role for circadian-signalling to influence multiple steps in the
SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Further work is needed to characterise the circadian-dependent mechanisms of
SARS-CoV-2 repression. A key finding from our study is the potential application of chronomodifying
drugs for the treatment of COVID-1932. Dexamethasone is one of the few drugs that can reduce the
severity of COVID-1933 and is known to synchronise circadian pathways34-36. Over the last decade, a
number of compounds that target core clock proteins have been developed37, including REV-ERB38,39 and
RORs40,41 agonists that have been shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus and HIV replication42,43. A report
demonstrating REV-ERB dependent and independent effects of SR900944 suggests some additional offtarget effects. We cannot exclude the possibility of additional pathways contributing to SR9009 antiviral activity; however, our use of genetic targeting approaches confirms a role for BMAL1 in regulating
SARS-CoV-2 replication. REV-ERBa agonists can also impact the host immune response by suppressing
IL-645 and so may offer a ‘two pronged’ approach to reduce viral replication and adverse host immune
responses.
Circadian clocks can also impact on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug responses46.
Epidemiological47-49 and molecular evidence50 shows that night shift workers suffer circadian disruption
and are at an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases. Identifying whether shift work
is a risk factor for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection or developing moe severe disease could inform public
health policy. Our observations raise questions as to how our in vitro studies translate to humans, where
the time of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may impact on the likelihood of infection, the host response, virus
shedding, transmission and disease severity and are worthy of further investigation.

STAR METHODS
Materials. All reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (now Merck) unless stated
otherwise. REV-ERB agonist SR9009 was purchased from Calbiochem, US, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and cytotoxicity determined by a Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (Promega, UK) or MTT
assay (Sigma, UK). The BMAL1 promoter was amplified from genomic DNA using forward primer: 5ʹCCGCTCGAGGGGACAACGG
CGAGCTCGCAG-3ʹ
with
reverse
primer:
5ʹCCCAAGCTTCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCAAGTC-3ʹ and cloned into the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector
(Promega, UK). The lenti-shBmal1 plasmid was purchased from Abmgood (UK). Recombinant ACE2-Fc
was previously reported51.
Cell culture. Calu-3, Huh-7, HEK293T and VERO E6 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 10μg/mL streptomycin (all reagents
from Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher). VERO E6/TMPRSS2 cells (a VERO E6 cell line stably
overexpressing the TMPRSS2 gene, kindly provided by Dr Makoto Takeda at Department of Virology III,
National Institute of Infectious Diseases52) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 10 units/mL penicillin, 10 mg/mL streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mg/mL G418 (Life
Technologies, UK). All cell lines were maintained at 37oC and 5% CO2 in a standard culture incubator.
Human PBECs were obtained using flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy from healthy control volunteers
under light sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. Participants provided written informed consent. The
study was reviewed by the Oxford Research Ethics Committee B (18/SC/0361). Airway epithelial cells
were taken using 2mm diameter cytology brushes from 3rd to 5th order bronchi and cultured in Airway
Epithelial Cell medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) in submerged culture.
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle genesis and infection. SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pp were generated by
transfecting HEK-293T cells with p8.91 (Gag-pol), pCSFW (luciferase reporter) and a codon optimised
expression construct pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2-Spike, as previously reported53. The Furin cleavage site
mutant was generated by mutagenesis of a pcDNA3.1 based clone expressing a C-terminally flag-tagged
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate; MN908947.3). The polybasic cleavage site TNSPRRA in
SARS-CoV-2 Spike was replaced with the corresponding SARS-CoV variant sequence SLL. The pNBF SARSCoV2 FL D614G mutant was a kind gift from Dr. Daniel Watterson and Dr. Naphak Modhiran at the
University of Queensland. Supernatants containing viral pp were harvested at 48 and 72h posttransfection, frozen and stored at -80°C. As a control pp were generated that lacked a viral envelope
glycoprotein (No Env) and were included in all infection experiments to control for non-specific uptake.
This control was included in all pp experiments and the luciferase values obtained subtracted from
values acquired with the SARS-CoV-2pp. To confirm spike-dependent infection, SARS-CoV-2pp were
incubated with the anti-S-mAb FI-3A (1µg/mL)54 for 30 min prior to infection for all experiments.
SARS-CoV-2 VSV pp were generated as previously reported1 using reagents provided by Stefan Pöhlmann
(Infection biology unit, German Primate Center, Göttingen, Germany). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were
transfected with an expression construct encoding a c-terminal truncated version of SARS-CoV-2-S for
assembly into VSV pp (pCG1-SARS-CoV-2-S-DC)55. After 24h, the transfected cells were infected with a
replication-incompetent VSV (VSV*DG56) containing GFP and firefly luciferase reporter genes, provided
by Gert Zimmer (Institute of Virology and Immunology, Mittelhäusern, Switzerland). After 1h, the cells

were washed with PBS before medium containing a VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant
from CRL-2700, ATCC) and supernatants harvested after 24h. The VSV*DG used for generating the pps
was propagated in BHK-21 G43 cells stably expressing VSV-G. Viral titres were determined by infecting
Calu-3 cells and measuring cellular luciferase after 48h.
SARS-CoV-2 propagation and infection. For infection experiments, the SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria 01/20
isolate) obtained from Public Health England was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Naïve Vero E6 cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.003 and incubated for 48-72h until visible cytopathic effects
were observed. Culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation to remove residual cell
debris and stored at -80oC before measuring the infectious titre by plaque assay. Briefly, Vero E6 cells
were inoculated with serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 stocks for 2h followed by addition of a semi-solid
overlay consisting of 3% carboxymethyl cellulose (SIGMA). Cells were incubated for 72h, plaques
enumerated by fixing cells using amido black stain and plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL calculated.
For infection of Calu-3 cells, cells were plated 24h before infecting with the stated MOI. Cells were
inoculated with virus for 2h after which the unbound virus was removed by washing three times with
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Unless otherwise stated, infected cells were maintained for 24h
before harvesting for downstream applications.
SARS-CoV-2 cell-cell fusion assay. The SARS-CoV-2 cell-cell fusion assay was performed as described
previously16. Briefly, HEK-293T Lenti rLuc-GFP 1-7 (effector cells) and Huh-7.5 Lenti rLuc-GFP 8-11 (target
cells) cells were seeded separately at 7.5x105 per well in a 6 well dish in 3mL of phenol-red free DMEM,
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 U/mL) before
culturing overnight at 37oC, 5% CO2. The effector cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing SARSCoV-2 Spike or a blank vector. Meanwhile, target cells were diluted to 2x105/mL and 100µL seeded into
a clear, flat-bottomed 96 well plate and mock-treated or treated with SR9009 (3µM or 7µM). The
following day, the effector cells were harvested, diluted to 2x105/mL and 100µL cultured with the
drug/target cell mix, with SR9009 concentrations maintained at 3µM or 7µM. To quantify GFP
expression, cells were imaged every 4h using an IncuCyte S3 live cell imaging system (Essen BioScience).
Five fields of view were obtained per well at 10x magnification and GFP expression determined by
calculating the total GFP area using the IncuCyte analysis software.

RT-qPCR. Cells were washed in PBS then lysed using Tri-reagent (Sigma), and mRNA extracted by phase
separation. Equal amounts of cDNA were synthesised using the High Capacity cDNA Kit (Applied
Biosystems) and mRNA expression determined using Fast SYBR master mix in a StepOne thermocycler
(Applied Biosystems) using the ΔΔCt method. The lung tissues were lysed in TRI Reagent (Sigma) using a
gentleMACS dissociator and RNA extracted using the manufacturers protocol. cDNAs were synthesized
using the Maxima H Minus cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) and mRNA quantified using iTaq
Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) and specific primers on a QuantStudio 3 RT-PCR system (Applied
Biosystems).
Immunoblotting. Cell lysates were prepared by washing cells with PBS, then lysed in Igepal lysis buffer
(10mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.25M NaCl, 0.5% Igepal) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Complete™) at 4oC for 5 min, followed by clarification by centrifugation (3 min, 12,000 rpm). Supernatant
was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in
PBS/0.1% Tween-20, then incubated with anti-ACE2 (Abcam ab108252), anti-TMPRSS2 (SCBT sc515727), anti-BMAL1 (Abcam Ab93806) or Anti-β-actin (Sigma A5441) primary antibodies and

appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO). Chemiluminescence substrate (West Dura,
34076, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to visualize proteins using a ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system
(BioRad). Anti-β-actin-HRP conjugate (Abcam ab49900) and/or Coomassie brilliant blue staining was
used to verify equal protein loading and densitometric analysis performed using ImageJ software (NIH).
Bioinformatics. The published 153 SARS-CoV-2 host factors were converted to Entrez gene names19.
BMAL1 regulated genes were obtained from the published BMAL1 ChIP-seq in the mouse liver21. REVERB regulated genes were defined from published liver-specific loss of the REV-ERB paralogues22.
Promoters (-1kb from TSS) of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 host factors were analyzed with the HOMER
(Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) tool for motif discovery (E-box motif CANNTG;
RORE motif RGGTCA).
Chromatin immuno-Precipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR: 1x107 Calu-3 cells were harvested from
80% confluent 15cm plates and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich 47608) for 10 min at room
temperature before quenching with 125 mM glycine. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS, pelleted
(800rpm, 10 min 4oC) and lysed in 500µl of Nuclear Extraction buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl,
1% NP-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Complete™). Samples were diluted
1:1 in ChIP Dilution Buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton, 0.2mM EDTA; 16.7 mM Tris pH8.1, 167mM NaCl)
and pulse sonicated using a Bioruptor R sonicator (Diagenode, U.K.) at high power for 15 min at 4oC (15
sec on, 15 sec off). Sonicated lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 10 min and
precleared with Protein A agarose beads (Millipore, 16-156). Samples were immunoprecipitated with
primary anti-BMAL1 (ChIP grade, Abcam Ab3350) or anti-REV-ERBα (ChIP grade, Abcam Ab181604) or
IgG control mAb and precipitated with Protein A agarose beads. Precipitates were washed in low salt
buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris pH8.1, 150mM NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS,
1% Triton, 2mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl), LiCl Buffer (1% Igepal, 1mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris
pH 8.1, 250 mM LiCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate) and finally twice in TE wash buffer (10 mM Tris pH8.0,
1mM EDTA) before being eluted from the beads in 240µL of elution buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, 1% SDS).
Complexes were reverse crosslinked in a heated shaker at 65oC overnight, 1400 rpm, in the presence of
200 mM NaCl. Eluates were treated with Proteinase K (SIGMA) and RNaseA (SIGMA) before cleanup
using MiniElute PCR Purification columns (Qiagen). Samples were analysed on a LightCycler96 (Roche)
using SYBR green qPCR mastermix (PCR Biosystems, UK). Fold enrichment was calculated for each
sample relative to their own IgG controls.
Animals. Mouse experiments were carried out at the Institute of Viral and Liver Disease animal facility
(approval number E-67-482-7). C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from Charles River and housed in
individually ventilated cages under a 12/12 dark/light cycle with a ZT0 corresponding to 7am. After two
weeks of acclimatisation, nine-week-old mice were sacrificed at different time points (ZT0, ZT4, ZT8,
ZT12, ZT16, ZT20; n = 5/time point). Organs were harvested after exsanguination by intracardiac
puncture, frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until further processing.
Statistical Analysis. All data are presented as mean values ± SEM. P values were determined using MannWhitney testing (two group comparisons) or with a Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA (multi group comparisons)
using PRISM version 9. In the figures ∗ denotes p < 0.05, ∗∗ < 0.01, *** <0.001, **** <0.0001, n.s. denotes
non-significant.
