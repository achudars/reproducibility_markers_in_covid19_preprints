ABSTRACT

25

Influenza virus and coronavirus, belonging to enveloped RNA viruses, are major causes of

26

human respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum

27

antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan (λ-CGN),

28

purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule

29

efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses, as well as currently circulating severe acute

30

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with EC50 values ranging from 0.3–1.4

31

μg/ml. No toxicity to host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 μg/ml. Plaque titration

32

and western blot analysis verified that λ-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell

33

lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent

34

manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to

35

cell surface receptors and preventing entry. Moreover, intranasal administration to mice during

36

influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight

37

but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, λ-CGN could be a

38

promising antiviral agent for preventing infection by several respiratory viruses.

Introduction

41

Carrageenans (CGNs) extracted from marine seaweeds belong to a family of sulfated D-series

42

polysaccharides harboring α-galactose residues. The diverse chemical structure and the degree

43

of sulfation divides CGNs into three major polysaccharide groups, kappa (κ)-, iota (ι)- and

44

lambda (λ)-CGNs, which contain one, two, and three negatively-charged sulfate ester groups

45

per disaccharide repeating unit, respectively1. These natural polymers of diverse molecular

46

weight have been used widely as pharmaceutical delivery vehicles that facilitate drug

47

formulation or sustained drug release. As biomolecules, CGNs have various biological

48

activities, including anticoagulant, anti-tumoral, or immunomodulatory functions

49

reports suggest that CGNs show in vitro or in vivo activity against rhinovirus, enterovirus 71,

50

dengue virus, human herpes simplex, African swine fever virus, and influenza A virus 4-10. Most

51

of these antiviral efficacy studies have focused on κ- and ι-CGNs; only one study suggested

52

that λ-CGN was a potent inhibitor of rabies virus infection

53

characteristics of λ-CGN, by which it has no 3,6-anhydro-d-galactopyranosyl linkage as well

54

as a higher sulfate content than the two other sulfated polysaccharides (Fig. 1A), we wondered

55

whether it is active against two different respiratory viruses: influenza A and B viruses and

56

severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

57

Influenza virus is a major human respiratory virus that causes seasonal epidemics or

58

unexpected pandemic outbreaks. It belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and contains an

59

eight-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome classified into three types, A, B and C. Type A

60

is further divided into subtypes based on the serological characteristics of surface glycoproteins

61

hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), while type B is split into Victoria and Yamagata

62

lineages. Even though therapeutic antivirals such as oseltamivir phosphate, zanamivir,

63

peramivir and baloxavir marboxyl, as well as preventative vaccines, have been successfully

64

developed, emerging drug-resistant strains and mismatch-derived inefficacy of vaccines mean

65

that this virus remains a threat to human public health, with an estimated annual mortality

66

burden of 290,000 to 650,000 deaths 12-14.

67

Coronavirus, a member of the family Coronaviridae, is also an enveloped virus with a

68

positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in length. Similar to

69

influenza virus, it is a zoonotic virus that causes respiratory disease in humans. Most infections

70

cause mild symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or dry cough. However, recently emerging viruses

71

have become more lethal and highly contagious. For example, SARS-CoV, first identified in

72

2003, had a mortality rate of 10%, with over 8,000 laboratory-confirmed cases, whereas Middle

73

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, had a mortality rate

74

of 34%, with 2,494 cases 15,16. In comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS, currently circulating

75

SARS-CoV-2 has a lower fatality rate (about 9% compared with SARS-CoV-1); however, it

76

has caused a global pandemic, with over fourteen million confirmed cases and 607 thousand

77

deaths recorded since December 2019 17. Despite this formidable circulation, we still have no

78

coronavirus-specific antivirals or vaccines. Because the symptoms and transmission routes of

79

these respiratory viruses are very similar, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent is required for their

80

co-treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the antiviral activity of λ-CGN

81

against influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 and to identify the mechanism of action.

Experimental Section

83

Cells, viruses, and compounds. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and African green

84

monkey kidney cells (Vero) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Cat.

85

Nos., CCL-34 and CCL-81; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). They were maintained in minimum

86

essential medium (MEM; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s

87

medium (DMEM; HyClone), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;

88

Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO, USA). Influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1),

89

A/Hong Kong/8/68 (HK; H3N2), and B/Lee40 (Lee) were purchased from the ATCC. The

90

mouse-adapted PR8 (maPR8) strain was a kind gift from Prof. H. J. Kim (Chung-Ang

91

University, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Influenza A viruses were inoculated into 10-day-old

92

embryonated chicken eggs at 37℃ for 3 days, whereas influenza B virus was amplified at 35℃

93

for 3 days in MDCK cells in the presence of 2 μg/ml tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone

Cell culture-based antiviral assay. An antiviral assay for influenza viruses was performed as

110

described previously 20. Briefly, MDCK cells grown overnight in 96-well plates (3  104 cells

111

per well) were mock-infected or infected with each viral strain at a multiplicity of infection

112

(MOI) of 0.001 at 35℃ for 1 h. After removing unabsorbed virus, cells were treated with 3-

CoV-2 activity, Vero cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates (2  104 cells per well). After

118

addition of compounds (serially diluted 3-fold), cells were infected at 37℃ for 2 days with an

119

equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.05) in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The cells were

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to determine EC50 values. Cell nuclei were counterstained with

123

4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) to calculate the CC50 values. The number

124

of S-derived (green) and cell nuclei-derived (blue) signals detected in four spots per well from

134

was used as a loading control and detected using a mouse anti-β-actin antibody (catalog no.

A1987; Sigma-Aldrich). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-

136

rabbit secondary antibodies were used to detect the primary antibodies (Thermo Scientific,

MOI of 0.001 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of λ-CGN or p-KG03.

144

On the next day, the culture supernatants were harvested and 10-fold serial dilutions were used

145

to infect fresh MDCK cells. After incubation of infected cells in overlay medium [serum-free

In vivo study. Antiviral efficacy study in a mouse model was performed by modification of

161

our previous report 18. Brifly, female BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks old; Orient Bio Inc., Gyeonggi-

162

do, Republic Korea) were infected with maPR8. Five units of 50% mouse lethal dose (5 MLD50)

163

of the virus were preincubated with λ-CGN for 30 min at room temperature. Mice were

164

challenged intranasally with maPR8 alone or with maPR8 mixed with λ-CGN (1 or 5 mg/kg)

165

in a total volume of 50 μl. The control group received OSV-P from days 0 to 5 p.i. (10

166

mg/kg/day (b.i.d.)) beginning 4 h before virus challenge. Changes in body weight and mortality

167

were measured every day for 15 days. Mice were sacrificed when they lost at least 25% of their

168

body weight. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines

169

approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Korea Research

170

Results

175

Anti-influenza activity of λ-CGN. To examine the antiviral activity of λ-CGN, increasing

176

concentrations of the compound were used to treat influenza virus-infected MDCK cells.

177

Another sulfated polysaccharide, p-KG03, of which antiviral activity has been elucidated in

178

our previous report

179

used as controls. The anti-influenza viral activity or the drug-resistance profiles of all of these

180

control compounds were reproducible, indicating that the cell culture-based antiviral assay is

181

reliable. The CPE assay on day 3 p.i. revealed that λ-CGN efficiently inhibited infection by

182

both influenza A and B viruses, with EC50 values of 0.3 to 1.4 μg/ml, with no cytotoxicity up

183

to a maximum concentration of 300 μg/ml (Table 1). Notably, the inhibitory effect was

184

comparable with that of p-KG03. To confirm this finding, we measured changes in viral protein

185

expression in cell lysates and infectious viral titers in culture supernatants (Fig. 1B and C,

186

Supplementary Fig. S1). The data revealed not only that λ-CGN is able to inhibit expression of

187

viral proteins NP and HA in infected cells, but also that is suppressed production of progeny

188

virus in a dose-dependent manner as in the p-KG03-treated samples. These results suggest that

189

λ-CGN has potent antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses in vitro, with selectivity

λ-CGN inhibits influenza viral entry. We wondered which step of the influenza virus life

193

cycle is targeted by λ-CGN. Intracellular distribution of viral NP was first compared in the

194

absence or presence of the compound at 4 h p.i, a time when NP was fully localized to the

195

nuclei accompanied by robust replication of viral RNA (Fig. 2A). The confocal microscopic

196

images revealed that, similar to p-KG03, λ-CGN reduced the number of NP-positive nuclei

197

when compared to the mock compound-treated sample. However, inhibition by the two

198

polymers had little effect on NP-derived fluorescent intensity. This finding during a single

199

round of infection suggests that λ-CGN targets the virus entry step rather than RNA-dependent

200

RNA replication or viral protein expression. To clarify its mode of action, we monitored the

201

intracellular distribution of NP at an earlier time point (2.5 h p.i.,) in the presence of CHX, a

202

protein synthesis inhibitor that allows tracking of the input viral protein and its localization.

203

Under these conditions, when NP was present in the cytoplasm but not reaching the nucleus,

204

λ-CGN completely blocked membrane penetration of the viral particles harboring vRNP

205

complexes as efficiently as p-KG03. No NP accumulated on the surface of the cellular

206

membrane strongly suggests that λ-CGN targets attachment of influenza virus to its cell surface

207

receptors.

208
209

λ-CGN protects mice from infection by influenza virus. To investigate the antiviral activity

210

of λ-CGN in vivo, mice were infected intranasally with maPR8 alone or with maPR8 plus λ-

211

CGN once. As a control, maPR8-infected mice received oral OSV-P twice a day for 6 days.

212

Antiviral activity was determined by monitoring body weight and mortality for 15 days. The

213

results revealed that maPR8 at 5 MLD50 caused body weight loss (Fig. 3A) and complete death

214

(Fig. 3B) within 8 days. Interestingly, intranasal administration of 5 mg/kg λ-CGN abrogated

215

infection-mediated body weight loss, yielding a 60% survival rate for infected mice. However,

216

this antiviral efficacy was not observed at a lower dose (1 mg/kg). As expected, treatment with

217

OSV-P at 10 mg/kg/day for 6 days showed notable therapeutic effects, ensuring the reliability

218

of the in vivo antiviral study. Taken together, these data suggest that intranasal co-

219

administration of λ-CGN prevents viral infection-mediated body weight loss and reduces

220

mortality.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of λ-CGN. Next, we asked whether the sulfated polysaccharide

223

has antiviral activity against another enveloped respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2. Vero cells

224

infected with the virus at an MOI of 0.1 were treated with increasing concentrations of λ-CGN

225

by using RDV as a control. On Day 2, immunofluorescence staining with an anti-viral S

226

antibody revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was inhibited effectively by the test compound,

227

without affecting cell viability (Figure 4A). As expected, anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was well

228

visualized in the RDV-treated cells. Quantitative analysis of antiviral dose-response and cell

229

viability showed that λ-CGN had an EC50 of 0.9 ± 1.1 μg/ml and a CC50 of >300.0 μg/ml

230

(resulting in an S.I., > 333.3), while RDV had an EC50 of 23.5 ± 1.2 μM and a CC50 of >300.0

231

μM (resulting in an S.I., >12.8). These results demonstrate that λ-CGN is highly active against

232

SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion

235

Sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin, dextran sulfate, and pentosan sulfate, as well as

236

various CGNs, show antiviral or virucidal activity against diverse enveloped viruses at subtoxic

237

concentrations 22-26. These studies of the physiochemical properties and molecular structure of

238

these compounds reveal that their antiviral efficacy is mainly due to their affinity for viral

239

glycoproteins, resulting in blockade of viral attachment to cellular receptors; the charge density,

240

chain length, degree of sulfation, and detailed structural features of these macromolecules are

241

critical for this interaction. In-depth studies of the underlying mechanisms demonstrate that the

242

macromolecules exert anti-HIV activity by competing with polyanionic regions of host-cell-

243

surface molecules for binding to the positively charged amino acids present in the viral

244

enveloped glycoprotein, gp120, including the V3 loop

245

polystyrene sulfonate against sexually transmitted infectious diseases caused by HSV-2 and

246

papillomavirus has been evaluated in vivo and in vitro 30,31. Unfortunately, prevention of vaginal

247

HIV transmission using topical cellulose sulfate gel failed 32, indicating the need to develop a

248

more potent microbicidal sulfated polysaccharide or to administer other polymers through an

249

alternative route, such as oral or intranasal.

27-29

. The microbicidal activity of

250

Regarding this issue, it is not strange to anticipate that intranasal treatment with active

sulfated polysaccharides could be a promising way to prevent infection by various respiratory

252

enveloped viruses such as influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and

253

coronaviruses. Previously, it was reported that κ-CGN with a molecular weight of 2 kDa is

254

active against influenza A virus in vitro, with an EC50 value of 32.1 μg/ml. In addition, ι-CGN

255

inhibited influenza A virus infection of MDCK cells with an EC50 value of 0.04–0.20 μg/ml;

256

not only that, intranasal administration of ι-CGN showed therapeutic effects in an influenza A

257

virus-infected mouse model 4,33. Notably, a randomized double-blind study in volunteers with

258

early symptoms of the common cold confirmed the efficacy and safety of an antiviral ι-CGN

259

nasal spray 34. In contrast to κ- and ι-CGNs, the antiviral activity of λ-CGN has rarely been

260

investigated in the context of viruses that are transmitted in droplets or through the air.

261

Therefore, we wondered whether λ-CGN is able to inhibit both influenza A and B viruses and/or

262

the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We were interested in λ-CGN, because this compound

263

comprises alternating (1,3)-linked α-D-galactose-2-sulated and (1,4)-linked β-D-galactose-

264

2,6,-disulfated units, has a higher degree sulfation with an ester sulfate content of about 32–

265

39%, and shows better solubility in cold water than the other two CGNs 35. Accordingly, the

266

sulfated polysaccharide was expected to have efficient and broad antiviral activity and to be

267

easily dissolved in an aqueous solution when it is formulated for a nasal spray.

268

Similar to the other sulfated polysaccharides mentioned above, we observed that λ-

269

CGN targets the influenza virus entry step. Strikingly, its virucidal properties led to a 60%

270

survival rate in virus-challenged mice after an exposure of infectious virus to the antiviral agent.

271

However, it is unclear whether this polyanionic compound is able to protect small animals such

272

as hACE-expressing mice or Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the

273

viral S protein-associated entry step

274

coagulant activity, any unwarranted side effects should be ruled out before clinical application.

275

This is because dysfunctional or aberrant coagulation is responsible for the hyper-inflammatory

276

responses observed in severe cases of influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated

277

pneumonia, and anti-coagulant signals could be over-stimulated already in the lungs of infected

278

patients 38,39. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest that λ-CGN inhibits

279

infection by influenza B as well as influenza A viruses and emerging SARS-CoV-2. The broad

280

spectrum antiviral activity of this compound would make it effective against different families

281

of respiratory virus that are circulating concurrently and when prophylactic treatment is

36,37

. In addition, because CGNs have intrinsic anti-
