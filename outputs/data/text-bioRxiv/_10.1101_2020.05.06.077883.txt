SUMMARY
We postulate that similar to bacteria, adult stem cells may also exhibit an innate defense
mechanism to protect their niche. Here, we provide preliminary data on stem cell based innate
defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection. In a
mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy
control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This
defense mechanism involves the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271+MSCs in the
lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype. The reprogrammed MSCs facilitate the activation of
stemness genes, intracellular Mtb replication, and extracellular release of Mtb. The conditioned
media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibit direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, our data suggest that reprogrammed
MSCs exert a unique innate defense against MHV-1 by activating dormant Mtb. The molecular
details of this anti-viral defense mechanism against coronavirus could be further studied to
develop a vaccine against COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediated
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demonstrates the ability of an emerging virus
to create chaos in our modern health care system and a severe strain on the global economics. In
the long term, post-pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 might activate dormant bacterial infections. As
per prior history, tuberculosis is one of the key bacterial infections affected by viral pandemics
(1-5). Strikingly, one quarter of the world population is already infected with dormant
tuberculosis (TB) (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis). If SARSCoV-2 infects these dormant TB populations, it may cause severe impact in global health and
economics by causing both COVID-19 and dormant TB reactivation. Thus, there is an urgent
need to study the association of COVID-19 with dormant TB reactivation to avoid a later global
TB pandemic.
Viral infection such as the influenza virus or SARS-CoV-1 is known to cause transient
immune suppression that leads to reactivation of dormant bacterial infection (6-7,4). In 1918, the
Spanish flu pandemic led to the rise of pulmonary TB incidence (2,8). Influenza in patients with
TB had the highest death rate (8-9). In the year 2009 during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, a
worse prognosis of influenza was observed in patients with TB or MDR/TB (10-11).
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
infected patients were reported to develop pulmonary TB (PTB) (5,4). Using a mouse model, an
earlier study showed that influenza A virus cause rapid development of PTB lesions (12) and an
increase in the mycobacterium load in the liver (13). Another mouse model of Influenza A virus
and Mtb co-infection led to enhanced Mtb growth by a type-I IFN signaling pathway (6).
However, severe inflammation in the lung is a common outcome of coronavirus infection (14), a

symptom which is also commonly observed in TB patients (15). Thus, it is possible that
coronavirus infection causing inflammation may also lead to reactivate dormant Mtb in the lung,
which has not yet been studied.
We have been investigating TB dormancy in the adult stem cell niches (16-18). These
stem cells reside in the bone marrow (BM) niche (19) and in the area of inflammation (20). We
have identified a rare fraction of cells in the BM, the CD271+BM-mesenchymal stem cells
(CD271+BM-MSCs) as the potential niche for dormant Mtb in mice and in successfully treated
TB patients (17). In this stem cell niche, Mtb remains dormant, maintaining reactivation
potential. Importantly, we have developed a mouse model of stem cell mediated Mtb dormancy
(17). Briefly, streptomycin dependent mutant 18b strain infected mice exhibit lung infection
following 3 weeks of streptomycin treatment. These mice develop granulomas, and also acquire
humoral immunity against the bacteria. Following streptomycin starvation for 6 months, the
bacteria acquire a non-replicating status. Mostly, these bacteria can be detected in the
CD271+MSCs of BM, but a few are also present in the CD271+MSCs of lung (17).
Furthermore, Mtb harboring CD271+MSCs reside in the hypoxic niche of BM (18). Notably, in
this model, the presence of Mtb-CFUs in the non-CD271+MSC compartment of lung can be
utilized as a sign of Mtb reactivation. Additionally in this model, the potential existence of
altruistic stem cell (ASC) defense mechanism can also be studied by evaluating the enhanced
stemness phenotype of CD271+MSCs as previously described (21-22,18).
Using this mouse model of stem cell mediated Mtb dormancy we sought to find out, if
coronavirus can reactivate dormant Mtb (dMtb). We are using a mouse coronavirus strain, the
murine hepatitis virus -1 (MHV-1) that represents clinically relevant human coronavirus SARSCoV-1 infection (23-25). MHV-1 infection causes acute lung inflammation by inducing acute

respiratory infection (ARI) within 2-4 days in C57BL/6 mice by increasing viral load. Animals
exhibit an elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha during 2-14 days
post-infection (23,26) and then fully recover (23). Therefore, this MHV-1 infected C57BL/6
mouse could be utilized for Mtb reactivation study.

Here, we demonstrate that MHV-1 infection causes dMtb reactivation in the mouse
model of stem cell mediated Mtb dormancy. Furthermore, we found that MHV-1 reprogram the
CD271+MSCs to an enhanced stemness phenotype. This phenotype then exert altruistic stem cell
(ASC) defense and this is evidenced by cytoprotection against MHV-1 infected type II alveolar
epithelial (ATII) cells. Thus, the remarkable significance of this study is that although, MHV-1
infection causes dMtb reactivation, it also activates an ASC based innate defense mechanism
against the virus and that could be further explored to develop therapeutics to target coronavirus.

RESULTS

MHV-1 infection leads to reactivation of dMtb in C57BL/6 mice
We reasoned that MHV-1 infection increases the Mtb-CFU level in the mice lungs
containing dMtb harboring MSC, and thus, could reactivate pulmonary TB. To test this
hypothesis, MHV-1 (5x10^3 PFU) was intranasally administered to C57BL/6 mice (n=25)
(23,25), having lung CD271+ MSCs, that contain streptomycin-dependent mutant Mtb strain of
18b in non-replicating dormant state for 6 months (17,27). Simultaneously, mice were also
injected with streptomycin as the mutant 18b strain requires the antibiotic to replicate (27). Study
was ended after three weeks, because (i) three weeks of streptomycin is sufficient to establish
lung infection (17), (ii) two weeks post MHV-1 infection, the C57BL/6 mice recover from viral
pneumonitis (23,25), which ethically permit us to extend the study to third week. Thus, the study

was ended on 20th day following MHV-1 infection. During 20th days of MHV-1 infection period,
animals (n=5) were sacrificed at stipulated time, lungs obtained, and the viral titers as well as
Mtb-CFUs in the lung tissues were evaluated (Figure 1B-C). We also measured the TNF-alpha
in the animals’ blood on day-2 of MHV-1 infection to confirm MHV-1 induced immune
response (23). First, we evaluated the viral infection in the mice as shown in Figure 1B. MHV-1
infected healthy mice were used as the control. In this control group, streptomycin was also
added to find out if addition of streptomycin can affect the viral load. MHV-1 infection in the
control group led to an increase in viral titers in the mouse lung for the first 4 days, and then
gradually decreased within next two weeks, which is consistent with the previous result of
C57BL/6 mice (25). MHV-1 infected mice with dMtb (henceforth, dMtbMHV-1 group) showed
an increase in viral load for the first 4 days similar to control, but then rapidly subsided at the end
of two-weeks, where the viral load was 20-fold less than control group (p<0.004; Figure 1B).
The TNF-alpha levels in both the groups were increased by 3-4 fold (p<0.03; n=4) on day-2
(dMtb–32.5 ±11.4 vs7.3±4.5pg/ml; dMtbMHV-1-36.5 ±14.7 vs9.5 ± 3.6pg/ml). These data
suggest that MHV-1 infection activated viral replication, and associated immune response in
both groups, although, viral load decreased in Mtb-infected versus non-infected mice.
Second, we evaluated Mtb-CFUs in the lungs of dMtb alone versus dMtbMHV-1 group.
Both the groups (n=10 mice in each group) received daily streptomycin treatment for mutant
strain to replicate. By 8 days of infection Mtb-CFUs was 6-7 fold greater than the Mtb-CFU prior
to the start of the infection in both the groups (p<0.0001, Figure 1C). Then, between days-8 and
20 of post-infection, Mtb-CFUs increased by 110-fold (p<0.0001) in the dMtbMHV-1 group but,
decreased by 2.1-fold (p<0.004) in the dMtb alone group. These results indicate that MHV-1
infection not only initiated but also sustained the Mtb reactivation process following

streptomycin treatment. In contrast, Mtb reactivation did not occur in the dMtb alone group as
the streptomycin treatment alone failed to increase Mtb-CFUs even after three weeks of
treatment. Importantly, we found 630 fold increases in Mtb-CFU between days 0-20 in the
dMtbMHV-1 group, which is equivalent to 1000 fold increase in Mtb-CFU in a dexamethasone
and aminoguanidine induced Mtb reactivation model (28).
Therefore, next we compared the MHV-1 induced reactivation of the dMtb with
dexamethasone, or aminoguanidine. These have been found to reactivate dMtb in a drug-induced
Cornell model by suppressing the immune system (28). To compare the reactivation of MHV-1
versus these immunosuppressive agents, dMtb harboring mice were treated with either of these
two drugs and streptomycin daily for a month, then the lung Mtb-CFUs were quantified. Next,
the Mtb-CFU of these two drugs treated mice with the Mtb-CFU obtained from one-month postMHV-1 infected mice were compared. We found that Mtb-CFUs increased by only 3-4-fold
(p=0.06; n=4) following either dexamethasone or aminoguanidine treatment, which was 400-fold
lower than the MHV-1 infection group (p<0.00001, n=4; Figure 1D). Thus, MHV-1 infection
was superior to dexamethasone or aminoguanidine to induce reactivation in our model of dMtb.
Our results also indicate that mechanisms other than immunosuppression may underlie MHV-1
infection mediated disease reactivation.

In this mouse model of Mtb dormancy, dMtb remains dormant in CD271+MSCs of bone
marrow and lung. We hypothesized that during dMtb reactivation, the bacteria transfer from
MSCs to non-MSC compartments in the lung (17). Thus, we analyzed the lung CD271+MSCs
for intracellular Mtb replication and release into the extracellular space. Lung CD271+MSCs
were obtained by immunomagnetic sorting after a stipulated time period of MHV-1 infection,
Viable cell count was obtained by trypan blue to evaluate expansion of these cells. The dMtb
group served as a control. We also studied possible CD271+MSCs expansion in healthy mice
infected with MHV-1 to evaluate a potential effect of this virus on MSCs of lung. Next, the
sorted cells were cultured in serum-free media for 8 hours to evaluate both the intracellular and
the extracellular release of Mtb by measuring Mtb-CFUs in the cell pellet and supernatant
respectively. We found that the dMtbMHV-1 group showed a transient 12-fold (p<0.001)
expansion of CD271+MSCs between day-0 and 8. Strikingly, we also found that MHV-1
infection alone group exhibited expansion of CD271+MSCs.

CFU/10^7 of non-CD271+ cells (the left over lung mononuclear cells after obtaining
CD271+/CD45- MSCs).
However, the expansion was 6-fold lower than the dMtbMHV-1 group; the dMtb alone
group showed no expansion of the MSCs (Figure 2B). Notably, in the dMtbMHV-1 group, along
with MSC expansion, there was a corresponding 27-fold (p<0.0001) increase in the number of
intracellular Mtb-CFUs (Figure 2C). During this period supernatant of dMtbMHV-1 group did
not exhibit marked increase in extracellular Mtb-CFUs compared to dMtb control (Figure 2D).
However, in the next four days i.e. between day-8 and 12, supernatant showed a 40-fold increase
of Mtb-CFU (p<0.0032; Figure 2D). Thus, Mtb-transfer from CD271+ MSCs to nonCD271+MSC compartment probably occurred between the day-8 and 12, when the supernatant
showed a sharp increase in Mtb-CFUs. Indeed, there was a corresponding 15-fold rise of MtbCFUs in the non-CD271+MSC compartment of lung cells in vivo (p<0.0001; Figure 2E). As
expected, the dMtb group showed no significant evidence of CD271+ MSC expansion,
intracellular Mtb replication, and their extracellular release (Figure 2B-E). Altogether, the results
suggest that MHV-1 infection induces a transient expansion of Mtb harboring CD271+MSCs and
pathogen’s release into the extracellular space.
MHV-1 infection activates the altruistic stem cell mediated innate defense mechanism
The MHV-1 infection induced transient expansion of lung CD271+MSCs in both Mtb
harboring and healthy animal group encouraged us to study the underlying molecular mechanism
of expansion. We considered that MHV-1 infection may activate an altruistic stem cell (ASC)
based innate defense mechanism that we previously identified in human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs) (22), and also in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (18). Briefly, when a clone of stem

cells such as hESCs cell colony is threatened by hypoxia/oxidative stress induced
differentiation/apoptosis, a few of these cells reprogram to an “enhanced stemness” phenotype.
This phenotype is characterized by distinct gene expression associated with HIF-2alpha stemness
pathway (22,29), and rapid expansion of the reprogrammed cells. These cells continue to
maintain enhanced stemness phenotype for the next two weeks, and then activate p53 to undergo
differentiation/apoptosis. During the expansion period, these cells exhibit altruistic behaviors by
secreting cytoprotective agents such as glutathione that enhance the fitness of the rest of the hES
cells. Thus, we identified stem cells with the “enhanced stemness” reprogramming as altruistic
Stem Cells (ASCs) (22), and described these cells as “intermediate” cell type in Waddington’s
epigenetic landscape (30) (Figure 3A) (21). Indeed, transient cells having ES cell like phenotype
has been identified in mice and human, including our findings (31) using defined criteria (32)
(Figure 3B), suggesting the clinical significance of ASCs. We speculate that this ASC
reprogramming may function as a putative innate defense system against invading pathogens that
threaten the integrity of the stem cells residing in their niches (32). Thus, our findings of MHV-1
mediated transient expansion of CD271+MSCs may be part of the ASC defense mechanism
against the virus. Indeed, the day-8 CD271+MSCs of MHV-1 infected healthy mice not only
showed expansion (Figure 2B), but when subjected to real-time PCR gene expression study
(Figure 3C), these cells also exhibited marked alteration of genes associated with enhanced
stemness phenotype (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, ABCG2, MDM2, GCL, p53,
and p21) (Figure 3D). We further characterized the stemness of these CD271+MSCs and indeed,
they expressed the MSC markers on day 8; CD73, CD74, and Sca-1 whereas CD45 was not
expressed (Figure 3D). Demonstration of the increased up-regulation of p53-upstream genes bax,
p21 and PUMA, and down-regulation of HIF-2alpha on day-20 (Figure 3E), further confirms the

ASC reprogramming. We also noted that the expression of Sca-1 was down regulated in these
cells on day 20 (Figure 3E), suggesting differentiation. Interestingly, in the dMtbMHV-1 group,
the several ASC reprogramming related gene (Oct4, GCL and ABCG2) expression was
increased by 2-3-fold compared to MHV-1 infection alone group (Figure 3D). Thus, these
findings suggest that MHV-1 infection led to ASC reprogramming of CD271+MSCs, and this
reprogramming was also seen in the dMtb harboring mice, when infected with MHV-1.
Activation of p53 upstream genes on day- 20 also indicated the activation of the proposed ASC
based innate defense mechanism in the infected CD271+MSCs against MHV-1.

We confirmed this ASC based defense against MHV-1 mediated viral load and cellular
toxicity in an in vitro viral infection assay (Figure 4A). We demonstrated that the conditioned
media (CM) of CD271+MSCs on day-8 were capable of exhibiting significant 2-3-fold
(p<0.004) cytoprotection of type II lung alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells against MHV-1 (Figure
4B-D). Notably, dMtb presence significantly boosted this ASC based defense against MHV-1 in
the in vitro viral infection assay, as the viral load was reduced by 3-fold (p<0.0074), while
survival of the ATII cells was increased by 2-fold (p<0.001) in the dMtb MHV-1 versus MHV-1
alone group (Figure 4B-C). Thus, these results provide supporting evidence for ASC based
defense of lung CD271+MSCs against MHV-1 infection, which could be further enhanced by
dMtb.

DISCUSSION
The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, has created a global pandemic associated with
substantial mortality and morbidity. Notably, a significant number of infected individuals have
recovered. However, evidence for a possible host defense or anti-viral mechanism against the
virus has not yet been identified. Currently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat
COVID-19. Using a mouse coronavirus model, we demonstrate that lung MSCs activate a
potential ASC based defense mechanism against the virus and this defense mechanism is further
enhanced by dMtb residing inside the lung MSCs. As per recent data from some surveys and
reports, it has been seen that countries which do not have a policy of universal Bacille Calmette
Guerin (BCG) vaccination have experienced higher mortality related to COVID-19 (33-34).
Interestingly, BCG is closely related to Mtb, which enhanced ASC based defense mechanism of
CD271+MSCs to fight against MHV-1 infection. Thus, our results described here could provide
a novel explanation of BCG mediated host defense or anti-viral mechanism against SARS-CoV2
that could be further utilized to design a drug or vaccine against the virus.
In a hostile microenvironment, microorganisms like bacteria activate a unique defense
mechanism (35), which can be explained as a charitable deed that help the neighbors to survive
unfavorable conditions. We have identified a similar altruistic stem cell defense system in hESc,
wherein a subset of these cells, (SSEA3+/ABCG2+), acquire an enhanced stemness state that
enable these cells to secrete antioxidants and growth factors in the hostile microenvironment of
oxidative stress. This altruistic act protects the rest of the population from oxidative stress

induced apoptosis and differentiation (22). The enhanced stemness state is associated with an
increased expression of Oct-4 and Nanog governed by an altered and transient state of the
p53/MDM2 oscillation system. After two weeks, the SSEA3+/ABCG2+ ES cell population
undergoes apoptosis or differentiation, thus exhibiting an altruistic behavior i.e. enhancing group
fitness by sacrificing self-fitness (22). In this preliminary study, we have demonstrated an ASC
based innate defense response against infection with the mouse coronavirus; MHV-1. The
recovered lung CD271+MSCs of MHV-1 infected mice exhibited the ASC phenotype, as shown
by their expansion, and expression of genes associated with the HIF-2alpha stemness pathway,
followed by the activation of p53 and its downstream genes including p21 and p53 up-regulated
modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) on day-20. The activation of genes involved in p53 mediated
apoptosis/differentiation was associated with the decrease in lung CD271+MSCs, suggesting that
the cells might undergo apoptosis or differentiation, an important phenotypic characteristic of
ASCs and ASC based defense mechanism. Notably, further support was obtained for ASC
reprogramming in vitro by studying the cytoprotective activity of these ASCs in MHV-1
mediated toxicity of lung alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, the conditioned media of the
CD271+MSCs recovered from the MHV-1 infected mouse lung, exhibited a direct anti-viral and
cytoprotective property on MHV-1 infected type II alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells. Hence, we
have identified a unique anti-viral defense system mediated by the innate ASCs. We suggest that
ASC defense system may be harnessed to develop novel therapeutic strategies against COVID19.
Furthermore, our results indicate that Mtb infection may boost the MSC mediated ASC
defense against MHV-1. Previously, we reported that post-therapy, CD271+BM-MSCs exhibited
an enhanced hypoxic phenotype of low CD146 and high HIF-1alpha (18), which could modify

the stemness state to an altruistic stemness state. We hypothesized that infection and
inflammation may activate dMtb intracellular to stem cells by activating ASC based defense
mechanism (18). Following MHV-1 infection, the non-replicating dormant m18b-harboring
CD271+MSCs underwent ASC reprogramming, and permitted m18b replication. There was also
a potential transfer of the pathogen to the extracellular space. However, the detailed mechanism
of Mtb reactivation needs further investigation. Here, we speculate that MHV-1 infection
inducing inflammation might trigger the mobilization of dMtb harboring MSCs from BM to lung
and cause rapid Mtb reactivation in lung, because; (i) studies showed that stem cells mobilize to
the area of infection (20) (ii) after 6 months of streptomycin starvation, a few Mtb was found in
mice lung CD271+MSCs, whereas a greater number of Mtb were inside BM-CD271+MSCs
(17). The remarkable and significant finding at this moment of COVID-19 pandemic is that the
Mtb reactivation was associated with significant boosting of the ASC mediated anti-viral
activity.
Lancet has recently reported that most of the death related to COVID-19 is due to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by cytokine storm. This will
mediate a severe attack by the immune system, as seen in cases of SARS-CoV-1 and MERSCoV infection, leading to the death of the individual (36). Studies support the use of various
therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in the treatment of ARDS. This includes anti-inflammatory
effects on host cells, reduction of lung alveolar epithelium permeability, increased rate of
alveolar fluid clearance, enhanced phagocytic activity of host mononuclear, direct transfer of
mitochondrial

DNA

and

secretion

of

immune response (32). We speculate that MSC to ASC reprogramming may further increase the
secretion of these immunosuppressive cytokines, thus potentially contributing to the reduction of
the cytokine storm in COVID-19 subjects treated with MSC therapy.
BCG vaccine has been proposed to work against COVID-19 infection, although the
mechanism is not yet known. It is possible that BCG may remain dormant in the lungs, which
then reprogram the MSCs to ASCs following COVID-19 infection and thus, could exhibit
antiviral defense against the virus. MSCs were already shown to exhibit antiviral activity via
extracellular vesicles carrying microRNA (37-39), and human cathelicidin hCAP-18/ LL-3 (40)
against influenza, hepatitis C and pneumonia respectively. We have also previously used BCGMSC interaction to target cancer stem cell (CSCs) (41). We speculate that the
immunosuppressive property of MSCs could help in neutralizing the severe cytokine storm
caused by COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, BCG might reprogram the MSCs to
ASCs. The enhanced stemness state might result in the secretion of factors like immune
modulators capable of protecting the cells from damage caused by COVID-19.
The adaptive immune response can play an important role in infection control of MHV-1
in C57BL/6 mice (25), however this does not solely account for the resistance displayed by this
mouse strain against the viral infection associated morbidity and mortality (24). So far in this
MHV-1 infection model and immune response, the role of trained immunity has not been
evaluated. The trained immunity constitutes innate immune memory where hematopoietic cells
may undergo cell intrinsic changes including metabolic and epigenetic modifications to
remember pathogenic insult (42-47). Trained immunity of MSCs has not yet been studied.
Whether our findings of ASC mediated innate immunity may include a trained immune
component requires further investigation. Such a possibility may provide explanation of BCG-

mediated trained immunity against viral infection (48-49,56). Thus, our model of Mtb and MHV1 infection in mice to study the putative ASC defense may be a useful model to study potential
MSC based trained immunity against coronavirus, specifically SARS-CoV-2.
A recent report suggest that subjects with TB increases the susceptibility and severity of
SARS-CoV-2 (50). In contrast, our findings suggest that Mtb reactivation reduces the viral load
in lung. However our study is based on a mouse model, which needs to be confirmed using
human clinical samples. Therefore, we are currently working on COVID-19 subjects to find out
Mtb reactivation in the lung. We are also studying the presence of circulating ASC in these
subjects as potential evidence for SARS-CoV-2 mediated ASC defense mechanism as described
previously (31).
In summary, we found that MHV-1 infection induces dMtb loaded MSCs to reprogram to
ASCs, thus activating the ASC defense mechanism and diminishing the MHV-1 infection.
Knowledge of immunity to SARS-CoV2 is still at a preliminary stage. Thus, our study may help
in understanding how MSCs inducing ASC defense mechanism will help in combating the viral
load in the host; thereby helping in developing a possible cure for COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mycobacterium strain and growth condition: All the necessary experimental procedures were
approved and undertaken inside BSC-class II facility in accordance with guidelines of
“Institutional Bio-safety Committee” of KaviKrishna Laboratory. Streptomycin-auxotrophic
mutant Mtb strain18b (gifted by Prof. Stewart T. Cole, Ecole Polytechinque Federale de
Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) was cultured in BBL Middlebrook 7H9 broth with glycerol
(BD Bioscience, #221832) along with 50 µg/ml of streptomycin sulfate. It was maintained at

37˚C and 5% CO2 with occasional shaking until the mid-logarithmic phase was reached, OD
approximating to 1.
Development of stem cell mediated mice model of Mtb reactivation: All the necessary
experimental procedures were undertaken in accordance with approvals of Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee, Gauhati University and Institutional Ethics Committee of KaviKrishna
Laboratory. The 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were obtained from National Institution of
Nutrition, Hyderabad, India and were maintained in the animal house of Gauhati University at
pathogen free condition as previously described (17). The mice model of Mtb dormancy was
developed in 6 months. Briefly, streptomycin-auxotrophic mutant Mtb strain18b cell suspension
was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-Tween 80 (0.05%), sonicated for 15 seconds,
and intravenously injected with 2x106 CFUs per mouse. Initially for 3 weeks streptomycin was
administered (3mg/mouse in 200 µl of normal saline) daily for establishing infection. Then, mice
were observed for 6 months without any streptomycin treatment to establish bacterial dormancy.
Following 6 months of streptomycin starvation, lung tissue were dissociated; CD271+/CD45MSCs and non CD271+ cells were isolated by magnetic sorting as previously explained (18).
The magnetically sorted CD271+MSCs and non CD271+ cells were subjected to Mtb-CFU
assay. Consistent with our previous findings (17), a small number of Mtb-CFUs (38±10 MtbCFU/lung) were obtained only in CD271+MSCs. Thus, mice model of Mtb dormancy was
developed. Then, streptomycin was injected intraperitoneally (3mg/mouse in 200 µl of normal
saline) daily for 3 weeks (17) with or without MHV-1 infection (23,25) to develop mice model
of reactivation. In a separate experiment, streptomycin treated mice were also treated with
immunosuppressive agents dexamethasone (0.08mg/day, 6 times a week) or amino guanidine
(2.5% wt/vol in drinking water) to cause dMtb reactivation (28). The treated mice were observed

for stipulated period of time, and then sacrificed to collect lung tissues. The Mtb-CFU of lung
was evaluated for Mtb reactivation.
Isolation and culture of CD271+MSCs: The mice lung tissues were dissociated using
collagenase/lipase and then, cells were subjected to magnetic sorting to isolate CD271+MSCs as
explained previously (17-18). Briefly, CD45- cells were magnetically sorted using
Ter119/CD45- depletion kit (#19771; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC). Next, the
CD45- cells were subjected to magnetic sorting for isolation of CD271+ cells. First, mouse
CD271 antibody (mouse clone ME20.4, catalog number Ab8877; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was
phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated by SiteClick antibody labeling kit (catalog numberS10467; Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Next, the EasySep PE sorting kit (catalog number 18554;
Stem Cells Technologies) was used to isolate CD271+ cells from the CD45-cell population. For
Mtb-CFU assay, cells were cultured for 4-8 hours in serum free media without any growth factor.
For cytoprotective assay, cells were isolated on day 8 following infection and cultured (1x10^7
cells/ml) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 media without serum for 24
hours to obtain the conditioned media.
Mtb-Colony Forming Unit (CFU) assay: This was carried out as previously described (17-18).
For the whole lung Mtb-CFU, the lung tissue were aseptically removed from sacrificed mice and
homogenized in PBS with 0.05% Tween 80, then subjected to CFU assay (18). For the Mtb-CFU
assay of immunomagnetically sorted cells, cells were isolated by dissociating lung tissue using
Collagenase/Lipase (17). The pellet was lysed with 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min,
vortexed for 30 seconds, and serial 10-fold dilution was prepared in Middlebrook 7H9 broth. The
diluted whole lung or cell lysate were then separately plated on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates
(BD Bioscience, #295964) along with streptomycin (50µg/ml) for the growth of m18b strain.

The agar plates were incubated for 3-4 weeks at 37oC and 5% CO2 and CFUs were counted.
CFUs were plotted as the means of log10 CFUs per lung or per 10 7 cells.
qPCR assay: To isolate the mRNA from bacterial infected CD271+MSCs, we used the
µMACSTM technology (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) as described previously
(17). Briefly, the mRNA is isolated in a magnetic column using super paramagnetic Oligo (dT)
Microbeads which target the poly RNA tail of mammalian RNA. The mRNA gets attached to the
magnetic column, whereas the bacterial and stem cell DNA remained in the passed-through
lysate. Then, the mRNA was converted to cDNA in a heated magnetic bar as per manufacture
instruction and cDNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using the TaqMan Gene expression assay
Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). RNA quantification was done using the ΔΔ Ct method
by using the SDS software, version 2.2.1 (17). The following TaqMan primers were used:
Mouse: CD271 (Mm 00446296_m1), CD45 (Mm 01293575_m1), CD44 (Mm01277163_m1),
HIF-2alpha (Mm01236112_m1), ABCG2 (Mm00496364_m1), Oct-4(Mm00658129_g1), Nanog

(Mm01731290_g1), p21 (Mm01332263_m1), MDM2 (Mm01233136_m1), Glutamate Cysteine
Ligase (GCL) (Mm00802655_m1), CD73 (Mm00501915_m1) and GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1).
MHV-1 infection into mice: Parental virus strain; MHV-1 was obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured inside the BSC-class II facility at KaviKrishna
Laboratory in accordance with approval of “Institutional Bio-safety Committee” and
“Institutional Ethics Committee” of KaviKrishna Laboratory. The animal protocol was approved
by the “Institutional Ethics Committee” of KaviKrishna Laboratory and Gauhati University,
Guwahati. MHV-1 was propagated on L2 (ATCC HCCL-149) cells, purified by sucrose gradient
centrifugation and titrated by end point dilution assay on L2 cells to determine titer of the viral

stock as previously described (51). Mice (C57BL/6 mice previously infected with the mutant 18b
Mtb strain followed by 6 months of streptomycin starvation, or control group - 25-26 weeks old
healthy mice) were intranasally infected with 5000 PFUs of MHV-1 per mouse (23,25). Briefly,
animals were anesthetized with ketamine intraperitoneally and then 50 µl of MHV-1 in PBS was
administered intranasally; this dose is known to cause ARI in this strain of mice (24,26).
Evaluation of lung infection was done by viral load study and measurement of TNF-alpha on day
0 and 6 as described (23,26).
Viral plaque forming unit (PFU) assay: This assay was performed as previously described
(51). In specific time period, animals were euthanized, and the whole lungs were harvested. The
lung tissue was homogenized as described (17), and the supernatant was stored at -80°C prior to
further analysis. One day prior to the formation of the PFU assay, L2 cells were seeded so that
the cell density could reach confluence on the day of PFU assay. The serial dilution of lung
homogenate derived supernatant was loaded on the L2 monolayer cells and incubated for one
hour at 37˚C. The inoculum was removed, and it was over layered with methylcellulose media
and incubated for 48 hr at 37 ˚C. The plaques were then counted and the virus titer was
calculated using the following formula: titer (PFU/ml) = [(number of plaques/well)/(volume of
inoculum/well)] x dilution factor.
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for TNF- alpha evaluation: This was done
by using an Elisa Kit (#MTA00B) of R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) as described previously
(22). Briefly, whole lungs were harvested and homogenized in DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (Sigma Aldrich). Lung homogenates were centrifuged,
and 50 μl of supernatant was added to the wells of the ELISA plate, covered and incubated at
room temperature for 2 hours. Each well was aspirated and washed for five times as mentioned

in the kit. 100 μl of Mouse TNF-alpha conjugate to horseradish peroxidase was added to each
well and covered with an adhesive strip. It was then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature
and then aspirated and washed. The plates were developed for 30 minutes using 100 μL of
tetramethylbenzidine plus hydroegen peroxide. Plates were read at 450 nm using iMark™
Microplate Absorbance Reader (Biorad, Gurgaon, India).
In vitro cytoprotection assay against MHV-1 infection: The type II alveolar epithelial (ATII)
cells of healthy C57BL/6 mice were first isolated as previously described (52) by isolating
CD45-, and EPCAM+ cells using immunomagnetic sorting (53). The isolated cells were cultured
in the fibronectin coated 6-well plates (2x10^5 cells/well) using DMEM/F12 and 10% FBS with
penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics. The cells were infected with MHV-1 with a MOI of 1:5 as
described (52) and then treated for 48 hours with the CM obtained from the lung CD271+MSCs
collected from the three groups (dMtb alone, MHV-1 alone and the dMtbMHV-1 group). The
conditioned media (CM) was collected from in vivo CD271+ MSCs by a previously described
method (22), where the isolated CD271+MSCs (1x10^7 cells/ml) were cultured in vitro for 24
hours, and then CM was filtered through a 0.2 micron filter. The filtered CM was added to ATII
cells. After 48 hours of growth, cytoprotection was measured by the reduction in viral load (viral
plaque assay), and cell survival (trypan blue assay). Trypan blue assay was done as previously
described (22).
Statistics: Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (Hearne
Scientific Software, Chicago, IL, USA). Student’s t test was used for comparisons with
Newman-Keul post hoc test. The gene expression was analyzed using One-Way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s post-hoc test. Data are expressed as means ± SEM; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001, ***P <
0.0001.
