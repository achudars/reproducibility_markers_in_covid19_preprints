Spillback transmission from humans to animals, and secondary spillover from animal hosts back
into humans, have now been documented for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to threatening animal
health, virus variants arising from novel animal hosts have the potential to undermine global
COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Numerous studies have therefore investigated the zoonotic
capacity of various animal species for SARS-CoV-2, including predicting both species’
susceptibility to infection and their capacities for onward transmission. A major bottleneck to
these studies is the limited number of sequences for ACE2, a key cellular receptor in chordates
that is required for viral cell entry. Here, we combined protein structure modeling with machine
learning of species’ traits to predict zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 across 5,400 mammals.
High accuracy model predictions were strongly corroborated by in vivo empirical studies, and
identify numerous mammal species across global COVID-19 hotspots that should be prioritized
for surveillance and experimental validation.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has surpassed 2.4 million deaths globally as of 17
February 2021 (Dong et al., 2020; WHO, 2021). Like previous pandemics in recorded history,
COVID-19 originated from the spillover of a zoonotic pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus
originating from an unknown animal host (Gage and Kosoy, 2005; Keele et al., 2006;
Taubenberger et al., 2005; P. Zhou et al., 2020). The broad host range of SARS-CoV-2 is due in
part to its use of a highly conserved cell surface receptor to enter host cells, the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) (Letko et al., 2020). This receptor is found in all major
vertebrate groups (Chou et al., 2006).
The ubiquity of ACE2 coupled with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the global
human population explains multiple observed spillback infections in the past year. In spillback
infection, human hosts transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus to cause infection in non-human animals. In
addition to threatening wildlife and domestic animals, repeated spillback infections may lead to
the establishment of new animal hosts from which SARS-CoV-2 can continue to pose a risk of
secondary spillover infection to humans through bridge hosts (e.g., (Guth et al., 2019) or newly
established enzootic reservoirs. Indeed, this risk has already been realized in Denmark (WHO,
2020) and The Netherlands, where SARS-CoV-2 spilled back from humans to farmed mink
(Neovison vison) and a variant of SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently transmitted from mink back to
humans (Oude Munnink et al., 2020). This exemplifies a major concern in these secondary
spillover events, where a mutant strain arising somewhere along the transmission chain (Garry,
2021; Oude Munnink et al., 2020) affects host range (Rodrigues et al., 2020) or leads to distinct
epidemiology in humans (e.g., via increased transmissibility among humans (Davies et al.,
2020; Volz et al., 2021), but see (Rambaut et al., 2020; Tegally et al., 2020)). Preliminary
evidence shows that the mink-derived variant exhibits moderately reduced sensitivity to
neutralizing antibodies (WHO, 2020), raising concerns that humans may eventually experience
more virulent infections from spillback variants, and that vaccines may eventually become less
efficient at conferring immunity to variants (Van Egeren et al., 2020).
Spillback infections are already occurring worldwide. In addition to secondary spillover
infections from mink farms, SARS-CoV-2 has been found for the first time in wild and escaped
mink in multiple states in the United States, with viral sequences confirming that the SARS-CoV2 variant from wild mink was identical to that found in nearby farmed mink (DeLiberto and
Shriner, 2020; ODA, 2020; Shriner et al., 2021). A variety of pets, domesticated animals, zoo
animals, and wildlife have also been documented as new hosts of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). The
increasing range of known hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and the global scale of human infections
signal that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to establish new enzootic infection cycles in animals,
making ongoing disease control more costly and difficult. In response, recent computational
studies make predictions about animal species that are most likely to be susceptible to SARSCoV-2 (Ahmed et al., 2021; Damas et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; S. D.
Lam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Luan et al., 2020; Mathavarajah et al., 2020; Melin et al.,
2020; Rodrigues et al., 2020). These studies compare sequences of ACE2 orthologs among

Figure 1. A heatmap summarizing predicted susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for species with confirmed
infection status from in vivo experimental studies or documented natural infections. Studies that make
predictions about species susceptibility are shown in the x-axis, organized by method of prediction (those
relying on ACE2 sequences, estimating binding strength using three dimensional structures, or laboratory
experiments). Predictions about zoonotic capacity from this study are listed in the second to last column,
with high and low categories determined by zoonotic capacity observed in Felis catus. Confirmed
infections for species along the y-axis are summarized in (Gryseels et al., 2020) and are depicted as a
series of filled or unfilled circles. Bolded species have been experimentally confirmed to transmit SARSCoV-2 to naive conspecifics. Species predictions ranged from warmer colors (yellow: low susceptibility or
zoonotic capacity for SARS-CoV-2) to cooler colors (purple: high susceptibility or zoonotic capacity). See

Studies predicting host susceptibility based on amino acid sequence similarity between
human (hACE2) and non-human ACE2 assume that a high degree of similarity is correlated with
viral binding, especially at amino acid residues where hACE2 interacts with the SARS-CoV-2
spike glycoprotein. For some species, such as rhesus macaques (Deng et al., 2020), these
qualitative predictions are borne out by in vivo studies (Figure 1) but predictions from these
methods do not consistently match real-world outcomes. For example, sequence similarity
predicted weak viral binding for minks and ferrets, which have all been confirmed as highly
susceptible, with minks capable of onward transmission to conspecifics (Damas et al., 2020;
Oude Munnink et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) (Figure 1). These mismatches to experimental or
real-world outcomes may arise in part because protein three-dimensional structure, the main
determinant of protein function, is robust to changes in amino acid sequence (Rodrigues et al.,
2013; Sander and Schneider, 1991). As such, sequence alone does not capture the details of
the ACE2 receptor interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Modeling the three-dimensional structure of protein-protein complexes addresses some
of the limitations of sequence-based approaches, and has proven useful to predict how different
ACE2 orthologs bind to the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) (S.
D. Lam et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2020). They can also be used to identify ACE2 amino acid
residues essential for a productive interaction with the viral RBD, and thus improve predictive
models of susceptibility through structure-based inference (Rodrigues et al., 2020). These
studies leveraged known structures of the hACE2 receptor bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
used powerful simulation methods to predict how variation across different ACE2 orthologs
affects binding to the viral RBD. While these approaches successfully predicted strong binding
for species that have been infected (e.g. domestic cat, tiger, dog, and ferret), the results are
also not consistently supported by experiments. For instance, while guinea pig ACE2 scored
favorably among susceptible species in one of the studies (Rodrigues et al., 2020), this ortholog
was shown experimentally not to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Li et al., 2020).
Although structural modeling has produced the most accurate results to date, all
currently available approaches for predicting the host range of SARS-CoV-2 are fundamentally
constrained by the availability and quality of ACE2 sequences. ACE2 is ubiquitous across
chordates, likely because of its role in several highly conserved physiological pathways
(Fournier et al., 2012). Because it is so highly conserved, the majority of mammal species
(>6,000 species) are likely to have ACE2 receptors, but there are many fewer sequences
available from which to make predictions using existing modeling methods (~300 species). The
functional importance of the ACE2 receptor suggests that it has evolved in association with
other intrinsic organismal traits that are more easily observed and for which data are more
widely available. These suites of correlated organismal traits may provide a robust statistical
proxy that can be leveraged to predict suitable hosts for SARS-CoV-2. Previous trait-based
analyses applied statistical (machine) learning techniques to accurately distinguish the zoonotic
capacity of various organisms (Han et al., 2020, 2015; Yang and Han, 2018), and predict likely
hosts for particular groups of related viruses (Han et al., 2019, 2016), predictions which have

subsequently been validated through independent laboratory and field investigations (e.g.,
(Goldstein et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017)).
Here, we combine molecular structural modeling of viral binding with machine learning of
species-level traits to generate predictions about species’ zoonotic capacity for SARS-CoV-2
virus across over 5000 mammal species, expanding our predictive capacity by an order of
magnitude (Figure 2). Crucially, this combined approach enables predictions for species whose
ACE2 sequences are not available by leveraging information available from viral binding
dynamics and biological traits of potential hosts. In our workflow (Figure 2), we first carry out
structural modeling to quantify the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for vertebrate species
using published ACE2 amino acid sequences (Sorokina et al., 2020). We then collate species
traits and apply machine learning to predict zoonotic capacity for 5,400 mammal species,
determined by a conservative threshold of susceptibility and onward transmission capacity of
SARS-CoV-2 reported by in vivo studies. Because COVID-19 is, at this time, primarily a disease
affecting humans, spillback infection of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals is the most likely
mode by which new host species will become established. Among mammal species with the
highest predicted zoonotic capacity for SARS-CoV-2, we identify a subset of species for which
the threat of spillback infection appears greatest due to geographic overlaps and opportunities
for contact with humans in areas of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence globally.

We assembled a dataset of ACE2 NCBI GenBank accessions that are known human
ACE2 orthologs or have high similarity to known orthologs as determined using BLASTx
(Altschul et al., 1990). Using the R package rentrez and the accession numbers, we
downloaded ACE2 protein sequences (Winter, 2017). We supplemented these sequences by
manually downloading four additional sequences from the MEROPS database (Rawlings et al.,
2018).

The modeling of all 326 ACE2 orthologs bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding
domain was carried out as described previously (Rodrigues et al., 2020), with a few differences.
In short, sequences of ACE2 orthologs were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2002) and
trimmed to the region resolved in the template crystal structure of hACE2 bound to the SARSCoV-2 spike (PDB ID: 6m0j, (Lan et al., 2020). Ambiguous positions in each sequence, artifacts
of the sequencing method, were replaced by Glycine to minimize assumptions about the nature
of the amino acid side-chain but still allow for modeling. For each ortholog, we generated 10
homology models using MODELLER 9.24 (Sali and Blundell, 1993; Webb and Sali, 2016), with
restricted optimization (fastest schedule) and refinement (very_fast schedule) settings, and
selected a representative model based on the normalized DOPE score. These representative
models were then manually inspected and 27 were removed from further analysis due to large
insertions/deletions or to the presence of too many ambiguous amino acids at the interface with
spike. Each validated model was submitted for refinement to the HADDOCK web server (van
Zundert et al., 2016), which ran 50 independent short molecular dynamics simulations in explicit
solvent to optimize the interface between the two proteins. For each one of the animal species
in our study, we assigned an average and standard deviation of the scores of the 10 best
refined models, ranked by their HADDOCK score -- a combination of van der Waals,
electrostatics, and desolvation energies. A lower (more negative) HADDOCK score predicts
stronger binding between the two proteins. We hereafter refer to predicted binding strength, or
simply binding strength, to indicate HADDOCK score. The HADDOCK server is freely available,
and we provide code to reproduce analyses or to aid in the application of this modeling
approach to other similar problems (https://zenodo.org/record/4517509).

shown importance in predicting host-pathogen associations in other contexts. For example, as a
measure of habitat breadth (Dallas et al., 2017), we computed for each species the percentage
of ecoregions it occupies. To assess the influence of sampling bias across species, we used the
wosr R package (Baker, 2018) to count the number of studies returned in a search in Web of
Science for each species’ Latin binomial and included this as a proxy for sampling bias in our
model.

Structure-based modeling of binding strength. We began by modeling predicted binding
strength for vertebrates, using boosted regression tree (BRT) models, an ensemble machine
learning approach that accommodates non-random patterns of missing data, nonlinear
relationships, and interacting effects among predictors. In a BRT model, a sequence of
regression models are fit by recursive binary splits, with each additional regression modeling
data that were poorly accounted for by the previous regression iterations in the tree (Elith et al.,
2008). All BRT models were performed using the gbm package in R version 4.0.0 (Greenwell et
al., 2020; R Core Team, 2020).
Quantifying a threshold for zoonotic capacity. While ACE2 binding is necessary for viral
entry into host cells, it is not sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Multiple in vivo
experiments suggest that not all species that are capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 are capable
of transmitting active infection to other individuals (e.g., cattle, Bos taurus, (Ulrich et al., 2020);
pigs, Sus scrofa, (Li et al., 2020)). Viral replication, and infectious viral shedding that enables
onward transmission, are both required for a species to become a suitable bridge or reservoir
species for SARS-CoV-2. In order to constrain our predictions to species with the potential to
perpetuate onward transmission, we trained our models on a conservative threshold of binding
strength (HADDOCK score = -129). Binding strength was binarized according to this threshold,
above which it is more likely that both infection and onward transmission will occur following the
results of multiple empirical studies (Table 1). This value is between the scores for two species:
the domestic cat (Felis catus), which is currently the species with weakest predicted binding with
confirmed conspecific transmission (Bosco-Lauth et al., 2020), and the pig (Sus scrofa), which
shows the strongest estimated binding for which experimental inoculation failed to cause
detectable infection (Shi et al., 2020). We note that there are species confirmed to be
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 whose predicted binding strength is weaker than cats, but
conspecific transmission has not been confirmed in these species. While it is likely that
intraspecific transmission will be reported for additional species, the binding strength selected
for this analysis represents an appropriately conservative threshold based on currently available
evidence. For additional modeling details, see supplementary file 1 Methods.
In addition, per-residue energy decomposition analysis of HADDOCK scores for 29
species indicated that all species with strong predicted binding had in common a salt bridge
between SARS-CoV-2 K417 and a negatively charged amino acid at position 30 in the ACE2
sequence (Rodrigues et al., 2020). Given the apparent effect of amino acid 30 on overall
binding strength, we constructed an additional feature to denote whether amino acid 30 is

Prediction across multiple vertebrate classes is difficult due to extensive dissimilarities
among traits describing different classes. For instance, traits that are commonly measured for
reptiles are different than those of interest for birds or amphibians. Moreover, currently available
ACE2 sequences are dominated by ray-finned fishes and mammals. Given that only mammals
have so far been confirmed as both susceptible and capable of onward transmission of SARSCoV-2, we created a separate set of models to make zoonotic capacity predictions for mammals
only. For this mammal-only dataset, we gathered additional species-level traits from
PanTHERIA (Jones et al., 2009) and added a series of binary fields for taxonomic order (based
on (Wilson and Reeder, 2005); supplementary file 2, Table 2). We then applied boosted
regression (BRT; gbm package, (Greenwell et al., 2020)) to impute missing trait data for
mammal species (e.g., (Han et al., 2020); see supplementary file 1 Methods for details on
imputation methods and results).
Many of the mammals for which we found the strongest evidence of zoonotic capacity
are domesticated to some degree (pets, farmed or traded animals, lab models) (Oude Munnink
et al., 2020; Schlottau et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Relative to their ancestors or wild
conspecifics, domesticated animals often have distinctive traits (Wilkins et al., 2014) that are
likely to influence the number of zoonoses found in these species (Cleaveland et al., 2001). To
account for trait variation due to domestication in certain species, we modeled mammals in two
ways. First, we incorporated a variable indicating whether the source populations from which
trait data were collected are wild or non-wild (e.g., farmed, pets, laboratory animals; non-wild
status confirmed by the Mammal Diversity Database (Database, 2020)). Trait data collected
from both wild and non-wild individuals were considered to represent non-wild species for the
purposes of this model. In a second approach, we used only the wild species for model training
and evaluation. For both approaches, pre-imputation trait values were used for all non-wild
mammals during model training, evaluation, and prediction.
For boosted regression models, we applied grid search to select optimal
hyperparameters, and repeated model fitting 50 times using bootstrapped training sets of 80%
of labeled data. We measured performance by the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) for predictions made on the test dataset (remaining 20%), corrected
by comparing with null models created by target shuffling, which employed similar bootstrapping
(50 times). Detailed methods can be found in supplementary file 1 Methods. We discuss herein
the results of model predictions about zoonotic capacity made by applying this final model to all
mammal species. We also report the mean and variation in predicted probabilities across all 50
bootstrapped models in supplementary file 4.
We identified mammal species with the top 10% of predicted probabilities of zoonotic
capacity for SARS-CoV-2. We mapped the geographic ranges of these species using
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) polygons of species distributions

(IUCN, 2020). We filtered this 90th percentile subset of mammal predictions to species that
occur in human-associated habitats (e.g., urban areas, crop lands, pastures, heavily degraded
forests) based on IUCN Red List assessments (IUCN 2020). We filtered a third time by masking
the ranges of species that overlap with locations reporting cumulative human positive SARSCoV-2 case data from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (Dong et al., 2020). While these cumulative
case counts do not encompass the true extent of the pandemic due to uneven detection and
reporting efforts across countries, they are currently the best available signal for the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 at the global scale.

The ACE2 protein sequence alignment of the orthologs from 326 species spans eight

belonged to the classes Actinopterygii (22.1%), Aves (23.3%), and Mammalia (46.6%).

We predicted binding strength for 299 vertebrates, including 142 mammals. These
binding strength scores represented six classes and 80 orders. Across these six vertebrate
classes, the strongest predicted binding between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 (corresponding to the
lowest mean HADDOCK scores), were in ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii; mean = -137.945)
and mammals (Mammalia; mean = -129.193) (Figure 3A). Each of these six classes included at
least one species predicted to have stronger binding than Felis catus (Figure 3B). Overall,
binding strength ranged from strongest binding observed for the cichlid Astatotilapia calliptera (167.816) to weakest binding observed for alpaca (Vicugna pacos) (-105.615). Among wellrepresented mammalian orders (those containing at least 10 species with binding strength
predictions), Primates and Carnivora showed predicted mean binding strengths that were
stronger than domestic cats (Figure 3C).

Additional methods and results of multiple uninformative model variations (e.g., a model
in which binding strength is modeled as a continuous rather than a threshold measure, a model
predicting the charge at amino acid 30) are also described in supplementary file 1 Methods and
supplementary file 3 Table 3. Details about how predictions made by past studies were
standardized into categories (low, medium, high; Figure 1) are also available in supplementary

Models created using the mammal-only dataset with trait imputation showed corrected
test AUC of 0.72 for the zoonotic capacity model (for results of all models, see supplementary
file 3). For mammal predictions, we applied the model trained on wild species given its higher
accuracy (corrected test AUC = 0.72), compared to a model that included all available species
and a variable indicating whether species trait data were collected from wild or non-wild
individuals (corrected test AUC = 0.70). Citation count, as a proxy for study effort, had ~1%
relative importance, suggesting that sampling bias across species had little influence on the
model.

The zoonotic capacity model identified 2,401 mammal species with prediction scores
above 0.5, and 540 species within the 90th percentile probability (0.826 or higher), representing
the subset of species assigned high confidence predictions of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic capacity
(similar to or greater than domestic cats). See supplementary file 4 for predictions on all 5,400
mammal species.
There were clear differences among mammalian orders in predicted zoonotic capacity.
The top 10% of species with the highest predicted probabilities includes representatives from 13
orders. Most primates were predicted to have high zoonotic capacity and collectively showed
stronger viral binding compared to other mammal groups (Figure 4). Additional orders with
numerous species predicted to have high zoonotic capacity (at least 75% of species above 0.5)
include Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), Scandentia (treeshrews),
Pilosa (sloths and anteaters), Pholidota (pangolins), and non-cetacean Artiodactyla (even-toed
ungulates) (Figure 4).

Our model combined species traits and viral binding strength to predict zoonotic capacity
(susceptibility and onward transmission). We note that our threshold for zoonotic capacity was
based on experimental studies confirming intraspecific transmission, and is therefore more
conservative than thresholds adopted by other studies (e.g., based on binding strength, (Huang
et al., 2020)). In addition, our modeling approach (machine learning) and prediction targets
(zoonotic capacity) differed compared to existing computational approaches, which applied
sequence-based or structure-based analyses that are limited to a small number of published
ACE2 sequences. Despite these differences, comparing species predictions generated by
multiple approaches can be useful for gauging consensus, and for comparing how predictions
change from one method to another. Across multiple approaches there was general agreement
in the predictions for primates and for a select group of artiodactyls and carnivores (Figure 5).
Our model results also agree with some low susceptibility predictions made by several previous
studies using sequence-based approaches (e.g., in certain bats and rodents). The structurebased models predicted a smaller proportion of species to have low susceptibility as compared
to sequence-based studies.

Among the subset of species with ACE2 sequences (deposited in GenBank or
MEROPS), our model predictions matched the results of most in vivo studies (Figure 1). For
instance, model predictions were consistent with the results of numerous SARS-CoV-2 infection
experiments on live animals. Experiments on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus; (Fagre et al.,
2020; Griffin et al., 2020)) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides; (Freuling et al., 2020))
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission to naive conspecifics. Our model also
predicted a high probability of zoonotic capacity of American mink for SARS-CoV-2 (Neovison
vison, probability=0.83, 90th percentile), in which farmed individuals present severe infection
from human spillback, and demonstrate the capacity to transmit to conspecifics as well as to
humans (Oreshkova et al., 2020; Oude Munnink et al., 2020). Our model also correctly

Most of the terrestrial world intersects the geographic range of at least one mammal
species within the top 10% of predicted zoonotic capacity for SARS-CoV-2. The highest
diversity of species within this top 10% occurs in the tropics (Figure 6A). Masking these species’
ranges to human-associated habitats showed that a total of 139 countries with at least one
mammal species in the 90th percentile (Figure 6B). Restricting further to regions where there
have been at least 100,000 cumulative human SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (as of 15 February
2021) highlighted 144 species across 71 countries (Figure 6C). These maps exclude the
distributions of companion animals and zoo species, for which SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and
veterinary records are not systematically available (McNamara et al., 2020). For a full list of
model-predicted zoonotic capacity of species by country, see supplementary file 5.

Some model predictions differed from the results of experimental studies. For instance,
our model predicted a moderately high probability of zoonotic capacity for pigs (Sus scrofa,
probability = 0.72, ~80th percentile). While some experiments have confirmed strong viral
binding in this species (Li et al., 2020), others report no detectable infection or onward
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Schlottau et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Similarly for cattle (Bos
taurus), our model also predicted a moderately high probability for zoonotic capacity (0.72,
~80th percentile), but in a live animal experiment, cattle were confirmed to be susceptible to
infection but no transmission was observed to virus-naive conspecifics (Ulrich et al., 2020).

Discussion
We combined structure-based inference about viral binding with species-level trait data
to make predictions about the capacity of animal species to become zoonotic hosts of SARSCoV-2 (zoonotic capacity). Our definition of zoonotic capacity includes critical elements

necessary for an animal host to serve as a zoonotic host, either as a new enzootic reservoir or
as a bridge host capable of seeding secondary transmission to humans following an initial
spillback event. First, species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is a necessary condition, which we
assumed to depend on the strength of binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and host ACE2.
Second, the capacity for onward transmission, which we model as a threshold quantity based
on available empirical evidence confirming SARS-CoV-2 transmission to naive conspecific
hosts. To extend predictive capacity beyond the small number of species for which ACE2
sequences are currently available, we leveraged data on intrinsic biological traits of ~5400
mammal species. We assumed intrinsic traits to be under similarly broad selection pressures
influencing major physiological pathways, such as those incorporating the ACE2 receptor
across species. This combined modeling approach predicted zoonotic capacity with 72%
accuracy, and identified numerous mammal species whose predicted zoonotic capacity meets
or exceeds the viral susceptibility and transmissibility observed in experimental infections with
SARS-CoV-2. In addition to wide agreement with in vivo study results (Table 1), model
predictions corroborate multiple previous studies investigating species susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 using the limited number of currently available ACE2 sequences (Figure 1).
Captive, farmed, or domesticated species. Given that the type and frequency of contact with
humans fundamentally underlies transmission risk, it is notable that our model predicted high
zoonotic capacity for multiple captive species that have also been confirmed as susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 via experiments or natural infections. These include numerous carnivore species,
such as large cats from multiple zoos, pet dogs and cats. Our model also predicted high SARSCoV-2 zoonotic capacity for many farmed, domesticated, and live traded animal species. The
water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), widely bred for dairy production and farming, had the highest
probability of zoonotic capacity among livestock (0.91). The 90th percentile of model predictions
also included American mink (Neovison vison), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), sika deer (Cervus
nippon), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), and raccoon
dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), all of which are farmed, with the latter two considered
invasive species in some areas (Milla et al., 2018; Pitra et al., 2010). In addition to the risks of
secondary spillover to humans and the potential for large economic losses from culling infected
animals (Kevany, 2020), the escape of farmed individuals into wild populations has implications
for the spread and enzootic establishment of SARS-CoV-2 (DeLiberto and Shriner, 2020).
These findings also have implications for informing vaccination strategies for people in regular
contact with potential bridge species (e.g., veterinarians, abattoir-workers, farmers, etc).
Live traded or hunted wildlife species. Model predictions also included many live-traded
mammals. The majority of the legal live mammal trade consists of primates and carnivores (Can
et al., 2019). Most live-traded primates come from the genus Macaca, with 20 out of 21 species
in the genus predicted to have high zoonotic capacity, along with several live-traded carnivores,
such as the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), grey wolf (Canis lupus), and jaguar (Panthera
onca). Two species of live-traded pangolins, the Philippine pangolin (Manis culionensis) and
Sunda pangolin (M. javanica) were also predicted with high zoonotic capacity. Pangolins are
notable because one of the betacoronaviruses with the highest sequence similarity to SARSCoV-2 was isolated from Sunda pangolins (Andersen et al., 2020; T. T.-Y. Lam et al., 2020).

Additional species in the top 10% of predictions that are commonly hunted include duiker
(Cephalophus zebra, West Africa), warty pig (Sus celebes, Southeast Asia), and two species of
deer (Odocoileus hemionus and O. virginianus) that are widespread across the Americas. The
white-tailed deer (O. hemionus) was recently confirmed capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to
conspecifics via indirect contact (aerosolized virus particles) (Palmer et al., 2021).
Bats. Similarly, bats are of special interest because of the high diversity of betacoronaviruses
found in Rhinolophus spp. and other bat species (Anthony et al., 2017, 2013; Olival et al., 2020;
Tsuda et al., 2012). Our model identified 35 bat species within the 90th percentile of zoonotic
capacity for SARS-CoV-2. Within the genus Rhinolophus, our model identified the large rufous
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus rufus), a known natural host for bat betacoronaviruses (Tsuda et
al., 2012) and a congener to three other horseshoe bats harboring betacoronaviruses with high
nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 (~92-96%) (Hul et al., 2021; H. Zhou et al.,
2020; P. Zhou et al., 2020). For these three species, our model assigned a range of probabilities
for SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic capacity (Rhinolophus affinis (0.58), R. malayanus (0.70), and R.
shameli (0.71)). Our model identified additional congeners, Rhinolophus acuminatus (0.84) and
R. macrotis (0.70), predicted to have relatively high probabilities. These predictions are in
agreement with recent experiments demonstrating efficient viral binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
for R. macrotis (Mou et al., 2020) and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in
field-caught R. acuminatus harboring a closely related betacoronavirus (Wacharapluesadee et
al., 2021). Within the genus Pteropus (flying foxes), our model identified 17 species with high
probabilities of zoonotic capacity for SARS-CoV-2. Some of these species are confirmed
reservoirs of other zoonotic viruses in Southeast Asia (e.g., henipaviruses in P. lylei, P.
vampyrus, P. conspicillatus, and P. alecto). While contact patterns between bats and humans
may be somewhat less direct compared with captive or farmed species, annual outbreaks
attributed to viral spillover transmission from bats illustrate a persistent epizootic risk to humans
(Kessler et al., 2018; Plowright et al., 2015; Pulliam et al., 2012) and suggest that gaps in
systematic surveillance of zoonotic viruses, including betacoronaviruses, are an urgent priority
(e.g., (Peel et al., 2020)).
Rodents. Our model identified 76 rodent species with high zoonotic capacity for SARS-CoV-2,
some of which thrive in human-altered settings. Among these, our model predicted high
probabilities for the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and the white-footed mouse (P.
leucopus). These are among the most well-studied mammals in North America, in part due to
their status as zoonotic reservoirs for multiple zoonotic pathogens and parasites (Bordes et al.,
2015; Machtinger and Williams, 2020; Ostfeld et al., 2006). Experimental infection, viral
shedding, and sustained intraspecific transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were recently confirmed for
P. maniculatus (Fagre et al., 2020; Griffin et al., 2020). Our model predicted low zoonotic
capacity for Mus musculus (0.11), corresponding with recent in vivo experiments suggesting this
species is not susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Bao et al., 2020). Also in the top 10%
were two rodent species considered to be human commensals whose geographic ranges are
expanding due to human activities: Rattus argentiventer (0.84) and R. tiomanicus (0.79)
(supplementary file 5) (Hamdan et al., 2017; Louys et al., 2020; Morand et al., 2015). Additional
common rodent species with relatively high probabilities of zoonotic capacity include

domesticated guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), gerbils (Gerbillus gerbillus, Meriones tristrami), and
several common mouse species (Apodemus peninsulae, A. flavicollis, and A. sylvaticus), all of
which are known reservoirs for other zoonotic diseases. It is notable that many of these rodent
species are regularly preyed upon by carnivore species, such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or
domestic cats (Felis catus) who themselves are likely to have high zoonotic capacity for SARSCoV-2.
Species with large geographic ranges. With sufficient opportunity for infectious contact, the risk
of zoonotic spillback transmission increases with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in human
populations. Among species with high model-predicted zoonotic capacity, there were several
relatively common species with very large geographic ranges or synanthropic tendencies that
overlap with high prevalence global hotspots of COVID-19 (Figure 6, supplementary file 5).
Notable species that are widely distributed across much of the northern hemisphere include the
red fox (Vulpes vulpes, ~50 countries), the European polecat (Mustela putorius), the raccoon
dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), stoat (Mustela erminea) and wolf (Canis lupus). White-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are among the most geographically widespread species across
Latin American countries with high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Globally, South and Southeast
Asia had the highest diversity of mammal species with high predicted zoonotic capacity for
SARS-CoV-2 (~90 species). Notable examples in the 90th percentile probability in this region
include both rodents and bats. For example, Finlayson’s squirrel (Callosciurus finlaysonii) is
native to Mainland Southeast Asia, but introductions via the pet trade in Europe have led to
invasive populations in multiple countries (Bertolino and Lurz, 2013). Hunting has been
documented for numerous bat species with geographic ranges across Southeast Asia (e.g.,
Cheiromeles torquatus, Cynopterus brachyotis, Rousettus amplexicaudatus, Macroglossus
minimus) (Mildenstein et al., 2016; Ransaleleh et al., 2020), and there were multiple additional
bat species in the 90th percentile probability from Asia and Africa where bats are subject to
hunting and from which other betacoronaviruses have been identified (Anthony et al., 2017;
Tampon et al., 2020). There were also several wide-ranging species whose contact with
humans are limited to specialized settings. For instance, biologists and wildlife managers handle
live individuals for research purposes, including grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), polar bear (Ursus
maritimus), and wolf (Canis lupus), all of which are in the 89th percentile or above for predicted
zoonotic capacity.
Other high priority mammal species. Species that are in frequent contact with humans that
showed more equivocal predictions warrant further investigation. For instance, while species
such as horses (Equus caballus), goats (Capra hircus), and guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) are
not in the top 10% of predicted zoonotic capacity, due to the nature of their contact with humans
they may experience greater risks of spillback infection, or pose a greater risk to humans for
secondary spillover infection compared to many wild species. Conversely, while certain
endangered or nearly extinct species are predicted to have relatively high zoonotic capacity,
they may have fewer opportunities for human contact. For these species, populations that are
under active conservation management may be at greater risk of spillback transmission. These
species include the scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), addax (Addax nasomaculatus), and
mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei), in which spillback infection may occur through close-

proximity eco-tourism activities (Weber et al., 2020). Indeed, spillback transmission of SARSCoV-2 has already been confirmed in a closely related species, the Western lowland gorilla
(Gorilla gorilla) in captivity (Gibbons, 2021). These species may benefit from focused risk
mitigation efforts, such as those enacted recently to protect endangered black-footed ferrets
(Mustela nigripes) from potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback (Aleccia, 2020).
All fifteen species of Tupaia treeshrews were predicted by our model to have medium to
high probability (ranging from 0.62 to 0.87). One species, T. belangeri, has been explored as a
potential lab model for several human infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 (Xu et al.,
2020). Relative to other treeshrews, our model assigned only medium probability for SARSCoV-2 zoonotic capacity in T. belangeri (0.67), which matches lab studies reporting
asymptomatic infection and low viral shedding in this species (Zhao et al., 2020). In contrast, the
common treeshrew (T. glis) was in the 94th percentile of zoonotic capacity (0.87 probability).
These two species are sympatric in parts of their range, exist in close proximity to humans, and
also overlap geographically with COVID-19 hotspots in Southeast Asia, suggesting the
possibility of spillover transmission among congeners if spillback transmission occurs from
humans to these species.
Strengthening predictive capacity for zoonoses. While there was wide agreement between our
model predictions and empirical studies, examining mismatches between experimental results
and model-generated predictions may better focus research attention on characterizing what
external conditions may be driving disconnects between predicted and observed zoonotic
capacity. For instance, in pigs (Sus scrofa) multiple computational and experimental studies
predicted susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1), but this prediction has not been supported by
results from whole animal inoculations, which so far have showed unproductive infection
(Schlottau et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Similarly, previous studies made contrasting predictions
about SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of American mink (Damas et al., 2020; S. D. Lam et al., 2020),
Figure 1) whose very high zoonotic capacity was only confirmed ipso facto in multiple countries
(Zhou and Shi, 2021).
Disconnects between real-world observations and in silico predictions of zoonotic
capacity may arise because host susceptibility and transmission capacity are necessary but not
sufficient for high zoonotic risk to be realized in natural settings. These processes depend
strongly on the cellular environments in which cell entry and viral replication take place (e.g., the
presence of suitable receptors and key proteases, (Letko et al., 2020)), and on host
immunogenicity (Bean et al., 2013). These processes are therefore embedded in a broader
ecological context impacting intra-host infection dynamics (latency, recrudescence, tolerance),
and environmental drivers of host susceptibility and viral persistence that collectively determine
where and when spillover may occur (Bean et al., 2013; Becker et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2020;
Plowright et al., 2017). Insofar as data limitations (e.g., limited ACE2 sequences or species trait
data) preclude perfect computational predictions of zoonotic capacity, laboratory experiments
are also limited in assessing true zoonotic capacity. For SARS-CoV-2 and other host-pathogen
systems, animals that are readily infected in the lab appear to be less susceptible in non-lab
settings (ferrets in the lab vs. mixed results in ferrets as pets (OIE, 2021; Sawatzki et al., 2020;

Schlottau et al., 2020); rabbits in the lab vs. rabbits as pets (Mykytyn et al., 2021; Ruiz-Arrondo
et al., 2020)). Moreover, wildlife hosts that are confirmed to shed multiple zoonotic viruses in
natural settings (e.g., bats, (Peel et al., 2019)) can be much less tractable for laboratory
investigations (for instance, requiring high biosecurity containment and very limited sample
sizes). While laboratory experiments are critical for understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis
and disease, without field surveillance and population-level studies they are only partial
reflections of zoonotic capacity in the natural world. These examples illustrate that there is no
single methodology sufficient to understand and predict zoonotic transmission, for SARS-CoV-2
or any zoonotic pathogen, and further demonstrate the need for coordination among theoretical
and statistical models, lab work, and field work to improve zoonotic predictive capacity (Restif et
al., 2012). As new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, our work demonstrates the utility
of combining molecular structural modeling with machine learning for predicting future animal
hosts, and the potential for similar multi-scale methods to bridge the many advances in
molecular and structural modeling with ecological and biological data to extend predictive
capacity for zoonotic pathogens whose host ranges remain uncharacterized due to persistent
bottlenecks in field-collected data on wild hosts and their potentially zoonotic viruses. Integration
of multiple methodologies, as done here, and more efficient iteration between computational
predictions, laboratory experiments, and targeted animal surveillance will better link
transmission mechanisms to the broader conditions enabling spillover, spillback, and secondary
transmission in nature.
