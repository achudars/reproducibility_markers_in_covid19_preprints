Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic
that seriously threatens global health. SARS CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane
enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the
nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein
forms biomolecular condensates with viral RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms
spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms mesh like-structures with viral RNA strands that contain
secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified an intrinsically-disordered region that
forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation.
By screening 1,200 FDA approved drugs in vitro, we identified a kinase inhibitor nilotinib, which affects the
morphology of N condensates in vitro and disrupts phase separation of the N protein in vivo. These results
indicate that the N protein compartmentalizes viral RNA in infected cells through liquid-liquid phase separation,
and this process can be disrupted by a possible drug candidate.
Introduction
The majority of current efforts to treat COVID-19 have focused on targeting the interactions between the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on human cells, which drive the initial infection of the host
cells (1-3). However, not much work has been done to stop proliferation of the virus in host cells following
infection. To propagate, the viral genome is first replicated inside the viral replication organelle, a doublemembrane vesicle derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (4). Genomic RNA is then exported to the cytosol
through a molecular pore complex and bound by viral N protein (4). The N protein restructures viral genomic
RNA into shell-shaped structures (~15 nm in diameter), which contain approximately 12 N proteins and 800
nucleotides of viral RNA (4, 5). These viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) form asymmetric “beads on a
string” structures which then bind to the viral membrane (M) protein on the surface of the ER-Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (4, 6). This interaction triggers the budding of the vRNP complex into the
ERGIC, and the enveloped virus is released into the extracellular space via exocytosis.
The N protein could be a potential drug target because of its fundamental role in the packaging of the viral
genome. However, the mechanism by which N remodels the viral RNA and packages it into a viral particle is
not well understood. Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV N protein overexpressed in cells forms puncta
that resemble biomolecular condensates (7). Similarly, in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the N protein's domain
organization and its involvement with phase-separated structures, such as stress granules (8, 9), suggest that
N protein phase separates with the SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells.

Phase separation of N can form membrane-less compartments that mediate viral packaging in host cells (10).
Phase separation has been shown to create membraneless organelles, including the nucleolus, centrosome,
heterochromatin, stress granules, and P granules when networks of weak interactions drive the de-mixing of
proteins from the surrounding environment (11, 12). Nucleic acids (RNA, DNA) are highly involved in the
formation of biomolecular condensates because they can scaffold multivalent interactions (13-15). Nucleotide
sequences without the ability to base pair (e.g. poly-G) are stimulated to phase separate by weak electrostatic
interactions between the polycation and the phosphate backbone (13).
The N protein contains many of the characteristic domain features common in phase separating systems,
including an uneven electrostatic charge distribution, an RNA binding domain (RBD), a dimerization domain,
and intrinsically disordered regions (Figure 1A). The RBD interacts nonspecifically with RNA and recognizes a
nucleotide sequence in the 3’ end of the viral genome (16). Both the N- and C-termini are disordered and can
potentially form higher order protein/protein interactions (Figure 1B) (17). These disordered regions are
arginine- and lysine-rich (Figure 1B), which may facilitate additional interactions with the negatively-charged
RNA backbone (18) and drive biomolecular condensation of RNA (19). The N protein also contains a
serine/arginine-rich (SR) motif, which has been associated with phase separation in other ribonucleoproteins
(16, 20), and a predicted prion-like domain (PLD) that can potentially trigger protein demixing (21). However,
the precise roles of these domains in packaging viral RNA remain to be elucidated.
The N protein could be a potential drug target because of its fundamental role in the packaging of the viral
genome and possibility of targeting of liquid condensates small-molecule therapeutics (22). However, the
mechanism by which N remodels the viral RNA and packages it into a viral particle is not well understood. In
this study, we expressed the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and tested if
it could create a biomolecular condensate with viral RNA in vitro. We observed that N and viral RNA form
higher-order structures that resemble the “beads on a string” pattern observed in infected cells (6). The N
protein nonspecifically interacts with RNA homopolymers to form liquid droplets, indicating that the length and
structure of the RNA determine the macroscopic properties of the condensate. Cross-linking mass
spectrometry (CLMS) identifies two regions flanking the dimerization domain where interactions are enriched
within phase separated droplets. The deletion of the C-terminal oligomerization sequence in particular fully
disrupts phase separation. Finally, we tested a library of FDA approved small molecules and identified drugs
that affect the number, size, or shape of the N protein droplets. Of these, the kinase inhibitor nilotinib affects N
protein condensation with viral RNA in vitro and disrupts condensates formed by the N protein in mammalian
cells.
Results
The N protein phase separates with RNA
We first asked whether the N protein forms bimolecular condensates in the presence or absence of viral RNA
in vitro. In the absence of RNA, N protein formed small puncta only at the highest protein concentration tested
(72 μM) under physiological salt concentration (150 mM NaCl) (Figure 1D). However, N formed spherical
droplets at lower salt with half maximal inhibition constant (IC50) of 94 ± 1 µM NaCl (±s.e.) (Figure 1C). The
addition of 50 ng/µL polyC homopolymer RNA substrate triggered phase separation of N even at physiological
salt with a half saturation constant (ksat) of 11.0 ± 0.7 µM, ± s.e., Figure 1D). These condensates were
dissolved under higher salt concentrations (IC50 = 163 ± 8 mM NaCl), suggesting that they are liquid-like rather
than solid structures (Figure 1C). Similar to polyC RNA, polyA and polyU homopolymer RNA substrates
produced liquid droplets at micromolar concentrations of the N protein (Figure 1E). However, mixing the N
protein with polyG, which forms G-quadruplexes, or polyAU, which forms stable base-pairing interactions, led
to the formation of more gel-like condensates with asymmetric shapes (Figure 1E, Figure 1_figure supplement

1). We concluded that unstructured and flexible polyanions form complex coacervates with the positively
charged N protein (20) and trigger formation of liquid condensates. The structure of the RNA affects N phase
separation, with secondary structures of RNA triggering formation of gel-like droplets (13, 23, 24). Phase
separation of N with RNA was also dependent on protein-RNA stoichiometry. Increasing the concentration of
the N protein promoted phase separation, whereas high concentrations of RNA dissolved these N condensates
(Figure 1E, Figure 1_figure supplement 2A,B), presumably by reducing the local concentration of the N protein
on an RNA scaffold (25, 26).
We next sought to characterize how the N protein could structure viral RNA into condensates. Recently, the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome was reverse transcribed and assembled into a DNA plasmid (27). We transcribed
six 5 kb fragments and two 1 kb fragments from the genome in vitro (Figure 1F, Figure 1_figure supplement
1B) (28). In silico methods predict that these RNA fragments contain secondary structure elements (Figure 1F,
Figure 1_figure supplement 1B) (23, 29, 30). Similar to synthetic RNA substrates that form a secondary
structure (Figure 1D), the N protein formed asymmetric gel-like condensates with viral RNA fragments in vitro
(Figure 1F, Figure 1_figure supplement 1B,C). The shapes of these asymmetric structures were consistent
with remodeling of vRNPs into “beads on a string”, as observed by cryoEM (6). These asymmetric structures
formed across a wide range of protein and RNA concentrations, did not change shape over time, and were not
strongly affected by raising the temperature from 20 ℃ to 37 ℃ (Figure 1_figure supplement 3).
Cross-linking mass spectrometry identifies N protein interacting sites
We next investigated how interactions between N proteins mediate phase separation using cross-linking mass
spectrometry (CLMS) (31), which detects protein-protein contacts by covalently capturing nearby residues with
bifunctional reagents. Because CLMS cannot distinguish whether crosslinks are formed between two N protein
homodimers or within a homodimer (32), we specifically investigated the crosslinks that are depleted or
enhanced upon phase separation. We first crosslinked the soluble (not phase separated) N protein in 300 mM
KAc without RNA using a bifunctional crosslinker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Figure 2_figure
supplement 1A). We detected that the N-terminal half of the protein, including the RNA-binding domain, makes
diverse contacts throughout the entire protein (Figure 2_figure supplement 1A). There was also an abundance
of contacts between the disordered regions immediately flanking the dimerization domain on either side
(referred to as R1 and R2).
Next, we performed quantitative CLMS measurements (33) comparing the soluble N protein in 300 mM KAc
with phase separated N protein in 100 mM KAc (Figure 2A). The soluble N protein was crosslinked with heavy
(D12) BS3 whereas the phase separated protein was crosslinked with light (H12) BS3. As a result, the
crosslinked precursor ions from high and low salt conditions were spaced by 12 Da, allowing us to compare
interactions between the two conditions (Figure 2A). Interactions between specific regions that promote droplet
formation are implicated by the ratio of the crosslinked precursor ion signal and its corresponding isotopic
doublet (Figure 2A) (33). This experiment was repeated by reversing the labels, such that (H12) BS3 was used
to crosslink the soluble N protein and (D12) BS3 was used for the phase separated N protein. Across two
independent experiments, 29 unique crosslinks were enriched and 30 crosslinks were depleted upon phase
separation (Figure 2B, Figure 2_figure supplement 1B). Remarkably, the analysis of the crosslink fold change
(Table S1) revealed that nearly all of the enriched interactions are concentrated in R1 and R2, whereas
depleted crosslinks more uniformly spanned the entire primary sequence (Figure 2C). These results indicate
that R1 and R2 drive phase separation of the N protein (Figure 2D, Figure 2_figure supplement 1C).
Our mass spectrometry (MS) analysis also found phosphorylation sites on the N protein (Figure 2E). While
some of these sites have been identified in previous studies (9, 34, 35), we also identified several novel sites
(Table S2). Although one of the phosphorylation sites (S176) is involved in a crosslink, the phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated peptides were both strongly depleted in droplets, suggesting that S176 phosphorylation

does not play a major role in phase separation (Tables S1 and S2, Figure 2_figure supplement 1B).
Additionally, MS identified native proteins that co-purified with the N protein in 1 M salt (Table S3). Consistent
with the recruitment of N to stress granules in cells (8, 16, 36), two of the most frequently identified proteins
were stress granule proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2, with R2 of the N protein interacting with G3BP1 (Figure
2_figure supplement 1D).
The C-terminal disordered region and phosphorylation modulate phase separation
To test the predictions of the CLMS results, we tested how deletion of the PLD, SR, R1, or R2 regions affects
phase separation of the N protein with polyC RNA (Figure 3A). Phase separation was only moderately reduced
in the ΔSR, ΔPLD, and ΔR1 mutants (Figure 3B, Figure 3_figure supplement 1), suggesting that these regions
are not essential for phase separation. However, deletion of the R2 sequence almost fully abolished the
formation of condensates with polyC RNA (Figure 3B, Figure 3_figure supplement 1). None of the deletion
mutants disrupted the asymmetric condensates formed by the N protein with viral RNA fragments (Figure
3_figure supplement 1E). These results show that R2 primarily drives phase separation of the N protein with
unstructured RNA, consistent with the role of this sequence in oligomerization of N (37).
Recent studies proposed that phosphorylation state on the N protein regulates genome packaging in SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 (36, 38-41), and the mass spectrometry analysis of our N protein purified from
mammalian cells identified several phosphorylation sites (Figure 2E, Table S2). Treating the full-length N
protein with casein kinase 2 did not affect its phase separation with polyC (Figure 3C,D) or its migration on a
denaturing gel (Figure 3_figure supplement 2A), suggesting that the N protein expressed in human cells is
already phosphorylated. However, treating N with λ protein phosphatase produced a noticeable shift in a
denaturing gel (Figure 3_figure supplement 2A). This dephosphorylated N phase separated similarly to the
mammalian expressed protein (Figure 3C,D, Table S4), suggesting that phosphorylation does not affect the
concentration of N required to form higher-order structures. To further characterize whether phosphorylation
affects phase separation, we dephosphorylated the ΔSR, ΔR1 and ΔR2 mutants. Dephosphorylated ΔSR or
ΔR1 did not produce noticeable changes in molecular weight (Figure 3_figure supplement 2B,C) and had only
a moderate increase in phase separation (Figure 3_figure supplement 2). However, dephosphorylated ΔR2
had a reduced molecular weight (Figure 3_figure supplement 2B). Although regular ΔR2 was unable to phase
separate with polyC RNA, dephosphorylated ΔR2 exhibited robust phase separation with polyC RNA, similar to
the wild-type N protein (Figure 3E,F). Together, these results suggest the R2 region promotes phase
separation and in the absence of R2, phosphorylation of the N protein inhibits phase separation.
Targeting phase separation of the N protein with small molecules
Phase separation may also provide a macroscopic readout to study the N protein and RNA interactions (42)
and suggest novel strategies to disrupt packaging of the viral genome. We attempted to identify small
molecules that affect N protein phase separation in vitro. We triggered the formation of liquid condensates by
mixing 7.8 μM Cy5-labeled N protein and 50 ng/μL polyC RNA in 150 mM NaCl. Lipoic acid, a potential drug
candidate that increases the liquidity of stress granules (42), did not affect phase separation of the N protein
(Figure 4_figure supplement 1). We also utilized a high throughput fluorescence microscopy combined with
computational image analysis for direct observation of in vitro phase separation of the N protein and
determination of mean the droplet size. By screening a 1200-molecule FDA approved library, we identified two
molecules that reduced the number of droplets (Class I), three molecules that increased the number and size
of the droplets (Class II), and two molecules that changed droplet morphology (Class III).
Class I molecules, nelfinavir mesylate and LDK378, produced fewer but larger droplets (Figure 4A,B, Figure
4_figure supplements 1 and 2), and both have been identified by other SARS-CoV-2 screens. Nelfinavir
mesylate is an HIV protease inhibitor that was identified in multiple in silico screens as binding to the SARSCoV-2 main protease (43-46) and was shown to block viral production without affecting viral entry in SARS-

CoV (47). Nelfinavir mesylate reduced droplet number in our screen with a half maximal effective concentration
(EC50) of 4.3 ± 1.3 μM (Table S4), suggesting that it could act by disrupting virion assembly. LDK378, a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was shown to reduce the N protein signal in infected cells (48). In our screen, LDK378
produced a similar phenotype as nelfinavir but with an EC50 greater than 40 μM. Of the three Class II
molecules that increase the size and number of N-RNA condensates (Figure 4A,B, Figure 4_figure
supplements 1 and 2), tolcapone, a methyltransferase inhibitor, had been implicated in reducing viral
production of an alpha coronavirus (49). The Class III molecules, nilotinib (a kinase inhibitor) and L-thyroxine (a
thyroid hormone receptor agonist), did not quantitatively change droplet count or area (EC50 > 40 μM) but had
morphological effects on the droplets at 40 μM (Figure 4A,B, Figure 4_figure supplements 1 and 2). Nilotinib
could be a promising drug target, as it was shown to bind the S protein (50), reduce viral titer in SARS-CoV
infected cells (51), and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 VeroE6 cell infection with an EC50 of 60 nM (52). Similarly, Lthyroxine has been suggested to reduce SARS-CoV-2 uptake through its ability to bind to integrin (53).
We next tested the drugs we identified in our initial screen against the condensates formed by N and viral RNA
in vitro. Nilotinib addition resulted in formation of thread-like filaments of N and viral RNA (Figure 4C), whereas
other drugs did not affect the condensates containing longer RNA (Figure 4_figure supplement 1). To test
whether nilotinib affects phase separation of the N protein in vivo, we transiently expressed N-GFP in VeroE6
cells. Consistent with our in vitro results, cells expressing N-GFP produced bright puncta, suggesting that the N
protein forms higher order structures in mammalian cells (Figure 4D, Figure 4_figure supplement 3A).
Incubating these cells with at least 3 µM nilotinib led to a significant decrease in the number (Figure 4E) and
the total area of the puncta per cell (Figure 4_figure supplement 3B) but did not significantly affect the GFP
signal per cell (Figure 4_figure supplement 3C). Therefore, nilotinib disrupts the association of the N protein
into higher order structures in vivo and could serve as a potential drug candidate against packaging of SARSCoV-2 virus in host cells.
Discussion
Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 N protein expressed in bacteria forms biomolecular condensates
with RNA in vitro (17, 28, 36, 38, 40, 54, 55). In this study, we expressed the N protein using a mammalian
expression system, which more closely resembles the N protein produced in infected human cells (9).
Consistent with Carlson et al. and Chen et al., we observed that the N protein requires unstructured RNA
fragments to form liquid condensates in physiological salt (38, 54), suggesting that the positively charged
protein and polyanion RNA form complex coacervates. The N protein is also capable of forming a biomolecular
condensate in the presence of 1-5 kb viral RNA; however, these structures appear closer to gel-like filaments
(38) and not as temperature-sensitive, liquid-like droplets observed by Iserman et al. using bacterially
expressed N (28). However, in agreement with Iserman et al., we found that the structure of the RNA itself
affects N condensation; base-paired or G-quadruplex-containing RNA produce irregularly shaped, gel-like
condensates, similar to viral RNA (28). RNA may drive the formation of abnormal droplet shapes by forming
networks of intermolecular base pairs, as previously reported (13, 23, 24, 56).
We also investigated which domain of the N protein drives phase separation by CLMS experiments and testing
a series of deletion mutants. PLD and SR motifs are common features of phase separating proteins (20, 21),
and the linker sequence outside the SR motif (amino acids 210-247) is essential for phase separation of N
expressed in bacteria (55). The SR motif was required for N/N interactions in SARS-CoV and for forming
puncta in SARS-CoV infected cells (41). In addition, the SR motif is highly phosphorylated in human cells (57),
and this promotes interactions with host proteins, nuclear targeting, and transcription of the viral genome, and
either enhances or inhibits oligomerization in SARS-CoV (16, 39, 57, 58). In SARS-CoV-2, SR phosphorylation
is reported to make N condensates more liquid (38). In contrast to these reports, we did not see evidence of
the SR motif driving the phase separation of SARS-CoV-2 N expressed in human cells. Instead, we found that
the R2 motif, which forms a transient alpha helix (17), is essential for phase separation with nonviral RNA.

Phosphorylation of the ΔR2 mutant fully disrupts phase separation, suggesting that phosphorylation interferes
with phase separation, and this is countered by the R2 motif. Because R2 promotes oligomerization and phase
separation of the N protein (37), targeting of this motif may be a viable approach to disrupt packaging of SARSCoV-2 in infected cells. Although we found that phosphorylated and dephosphorylated full-length N protein
phase separate at a similar protein concentration, our results are not inconsistent with phosphorylation of the N
protein to reduce the amount of RNA required to form a condensate (36), as well as to affect the transcription
of the genomic RNA (58).
Although it remains to be demonstrated whether phase separation is essential for propagation of SARS-CoV-2,
the filament structures we observe recapitulate vRNPs observed in infected cells (4-6). These “beads on a
string” structures are seen both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the assembly of a virus inside host cells
may involve the formation of gel-like condensates of the N protein (Figure 5). In the measles virus,
nucleoprotein (N) contains an RNA binding domain while phosphoprotein (P) contains an oligomerization
domain. N and P form condensates when mixed together (59). In coronaviruses, the N protein possesses both
an RNA-binding and oligomerization domain in a single peptide chain. Vesicular stomatitis virus and rabies
virus create membraneless compartments as sites of RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and
these compartments have characteristics of liquid condensates (60, 61). These results indicate that phase
separation may serve as a general mechanism used by RNA viruses to propagate in host cells. Future studies
are required to test whether mutations or deletion of the R2 motif of the viral genome alter localization of the N
protein and reduce the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in infected cells.
We tested phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein to gain mechanistic insight into how existing drugs
can modulate a specific viral process, rather than broad cell pathology. The most specific drug we identified is
nilotinib, which affected phase separation with nonspecific polyC RNA and specific viral RNA in vitro, as well as
decreased the number of N puncta in cells. Previous studies showed that nilotinib inhibits the proliferation of
both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (50-52), but the mechanism of this inhibition was unknown. Our results
indicate that nilotinib affects the formation of the N/RNA condensates, which could potentially impair viral
replication. Nilotinib has been shown to be readily absorbed in patients, with a minimal steady state plasma
concentration of about 1000 ng/mL (~2 μM) (62). Several COVID-19 clinical trials of imatinib, the parent drug of
nilotinib, are underway (63). Although nilotinib has not been a part of a COVID-19 clinical trial, by using phase
separation as a proxy for vRNP formation, our results indicate that nilotinib could represent a viable approach
in future studies of COVID-19.

Figure 4. Identification of small molecules that alter phase separation of N in vitro and in vivo. (A)
Examples of Class I, II, and III drugs. The N protein and polyC RNA concentrations were set to 7.8 μM and 50
ng/uL, respectively. (B) Changes in the total surface area and the number of droplets formed by N and polyC
RNA upon drug treatment (mean ± s.d., n = 8 with two technical replicates). Solid curves represent a fit to a
dose response equation (see Methods). (C) 57.6 μM N protein and N gene RNA mixtures as a function of
nilotinib. (D) VeroE6 cells transfected with N-GFP form puncta. Nilotinib treatment reduces the number of
puncta per cell. (E) The number of puncta per nucleus under different nilotinib treatments. The center and
edges of boxes represent median with first and third quartile (four technical replicates for the 0 μM and 5 μM
conditions; two technical replicates for all other conditions; from left to right, n = 118, 122, 62, 57, 64, 78, 88,
95, 67, 64). p values are calculated from a two-tailed t-test.

Figure 5. Model for remodeling of viral RNA genome by the SARS CoV-2 N protein. (A) The N protein
packages viral genomic RNA into asymmetric gel-like structures through phase separation. Nilotinib disfavors
formation of higher order structures by the N protein, and may disrupt packaging of the RNA genome into the
viral envelope. (B) vRNPs interact with the viral membrane proteins on the surface of the ER-Golgi
intermediate compartment and form the enveloped virus.

Figure 2_figure supplement 1. Interactions between N proteins and between N and G3BP1. (A) In an
initial qualitative experiment, pairwise interactions were detected by CLMS at 300 mM salt. Lines depict a
unique crosslink detected. The regions of N protein interactions flank the dimerization domain. (B) Volcano plot
of the quantitative CLMS data comparing the droplet and no droplet condition. Opaque data points have a pvalue below 0.05, transparent data points have p-value greater than 0.05. Green represents unique crosslinks
that are enriched in the droplet condition. The yellow markers represent the K169-K65 and K169(phosS176)K65 crosslinks. (C) The structure of the dimerization domain (pdb# 2JW8 (64)). Because the N and C termini of
the protomers are positioned away from each other, R1 and R2 within the same dimer are unlikely to interact
with each other. (D) Mass spectrometry identified that the RNA binding domain of the stress granule protein

Methods
Protein purification
A construct for expressing N protein with a C-terminal Strep tag was obtained from the Krogan lab (UCSF). A
C-terminal yBBr labeling site was added, and deletion mutants were generated using Gibson cloning (New
England Biosciences). Sufficient amounts of DNA were obtained growing 1 L of transfected XL1Blue
Escherichia coli cells overnight and performing a gigaprep (Zymo). For protein expression, HEK GNTI cells
were grown in suspension in Freestyle media (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS (VWR) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin (Gemini Bio-products) to 2 million cells/mL. Cells were spun down for 10 min at 1,200 rcf and
resuspended in fresh, antibiotic-free media. For 250 mL cells, the transfection solution was created by mixing
1.8 mL PEI (1mg/mL, pH 7.0 in PBS) dissolved in 20 mL Freestyle media and 0.66 mg DNA dissolved in 20 mL
Freestyle media. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before being adding it to the cell
culture. Transfected cell culture was grown for 72 h at 125 rpm at 37° with 5% CO2 and 8% humidity.
Cells were then harvested at 4,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in 50 mL lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4,
1 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor (Sigma)). Lysis was performed using 15
loose and 15 tight plunges of a Wheaton glass dounce. The lysate was clarified using a 45 min, 360,000 g spin
in a Ti70 rotor. The supernatant was incubated with 1 mL Streptactin sepharose beads (IBA Life Sciences) for
1 h. Beads were washed with 40 mL of lysis buffer followed by 30 mL labelling buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4,
300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Beads were then collected and
incubated with purified SFP protein and a fluorescent dye functionalized with CoA (Lumidyne) at room
temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed with 30 mL labeling buffer. If proteins were to be kinase or
phosphatase treated, they were additionally washed with 30 mL kinase (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300mM NaCl,
10 mM MgCl2, 200 μM ATP, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) or phosphatase (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300mM NaCl,
1mM MnSO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) buffer. Protein was eluted in 1 mL fractions in its final buffer
supplemented with 10 mM desthiobiotin, and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 30K concentrators. For kinase
and phosphatase treatment, 5 µL of CKII kinase (New England Biolabs) and 2.5 µL λ phosphatase (New
England Biolabs) was added per 50 µL concentrated protein, respectively, and the samples were incubated at
30 ℃ for 1 h. Final protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent, and aliquots were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen.
In Vitro Transcription and RNA Labeling
For in vitro transcription of long viral RNA, the region of interest was first PCR amplified from a plasmid (N
plasmid was a generous gift from the Krogan lab (8), 5’UTR plasmid was a generous gift from the Gladfelter
lab (28), and SARS-CoV-2 cDNA plasmid was a generous gift of the Thiel lab (27)) using a forward primer with
a T7 polymerase binding site (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG). The amplified DNA was tested for purity on a
0.8% agarose gel and cleaned up using GlycoBlue and ethanol precipitation. RNA was generated using the
HiScribe T7 Quick kit (New England Biolabs) and extracted using trizol and isopropanol precipitation. RNA was
Cy3 labeled using a Label IT kit (Mirus Bio), and RNA purity was verified using a 0.8% agarose gel. All RNA
structure predictions were done on the RNAfold server (29, 30).
Sample Preparation and Microscopy
Purified protein and RNA samples were diluted into the imaging buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% pluronic) to their final concentration and introduced into the flow
chamber. Samples were settled onto the coverslip for 25 min before imaging. Different buffers were used for
phosphatase-treated (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MnSO4, 1 mM DTT, 1% pluronic) and
kinase treated (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 1% pluronic)
samples.

Imaging was performed using a custom-built fiber-coupled Nikon Ti-E Eclipse microscope equipped with an
objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illuminator and 100X 1.49 N.A. Plan Apo oil
immersion objective (Nikon). The samples were excited in near-TIRF using 561 and 633 nm laser beams
(Coherent). The fluorescent signal was detected by Andor Ixon electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) Camera
(512x512 pixels). The effective pixel size was 160 nm after magnification. 10 single-frame images were
acquired for each condition in each replicate. To calculate the saturation concentration of the proteins, the
percent area of the slide covered by the droplets was quantified with Fiji using the Phansalkar function with a
30-pixel radius. Data fitting was performed in Origin.
Mass Spectrometry
Crosslinking analysis was performed as described by McGilvray et al. (65) with deviations outlined here. 15 µL
90 µM N protein in the labeling buffer was diluted 1:3 v/v into either water or labeling buffer. Diluted protein
formed droplets in the water dilution, but not in the labeling buffer that contains 300 mM NaCl. Isotopicallycoded light (H12) and heavy (D12) BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) crosslinkers (Creative Molecules Inc.)
were immediately added to the diluted solution. Final concentration of BS3 was 0.8 mM for 100 mM NaCl
dilution and 2.5 mM for 300 mM NaCl dilution. Crosslinking was performed for 30 min at room temperature and
then quenched with 1 M Tris pH 8.0 buffer. This experiment was performed in duplicate, once with D12-BS3
crosslinking N protein in droplets and H12-BS3 crosslinking soluble N protein and once with the labels
reversed. The crosslinked proteins from both channels were pooled prior to acetone precipitation. Protein was
precipitated with acetone overnight at -20 ℃. Protein was pelleted, supernatant was removed, and the
samples were air dried for 10 min. The pellets were brought up in 8 M urea, reduced with TCEP, alkylated with
iodoacetamide, diluted 4-fold, and digested with two rounds of trypsin. Peptides were desalted on a C18
MacroTrap column (Michrom Bioresources) and fractionated on a Superdex Peptide (GE Life Sciences) sizeexclusion column. Fractions enriched in crosslinked peptides were dried and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid
for mass spectrometry. Later eluting fractions were used for phosphorylation analysis. Each of the replicates
was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and each fraction was injected twice, generating 16
mass spectrometry files for analysis.
Mass spectrometry was acquired on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos coupled with an Easy-Spray nanoelectrospray
ion source, a 15 cm x 75 µm PepMap C18 column (Thermo) and an M-class NanoAcuity UPLC system
(Waters). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runs were 90 min long. Precursor ions were
measured in the Orbitrap at 120 k resolution. Selected precursor ions (triply charged and higher) were isolated
and the product ions were measured in the Orbitrap at 30 k resolution. Samples that were analyzed for
phosphorylation were run similarly except only HCD product ions spectra were collected and doubly charge
precursors were included.
Crosslinked spectra were identified with Protein Prospector 6.2.23 (66) using the combination of
DSS/DSS:2H12 at uncleaved Lys residues and protein N-terminus as the crosslinking reagents. The
corresponding light and heavy dead-end modifications, incorrect monoisotopic peak assignment (+1Da neutral
loss), N-terminal pyroglutamate formation, methionine oxidation, and acetylation and loss of the protein Nterminal methionine were set as variable modifications with three variable modifications per peptide allowed.
Trypsin with two missed cleavages was the digestion enzyme and the mass tolerances were 20 and 30 ppm
for precursor and product ions. The search database comprised the 14 most abundant proteins (sorted by
Spectral Abundance Factor) found in the linear peptide SEC fractions, alongside a decoy database that was
ten times longer. Crosslink spectral matches were classified at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold.
Protein Prospector was used to search for phosphopeptides of the linear peptide fractions using the following
parameters: tryptic specificity with 2 missed cleavages, 7 and 15 ppm precursor and product ion tolerances,
and carbamidomethyl (C) fixed modification. Variable modifications were as above except that Phospho (STY)

was included and only dead-end crosslink modifications were included. Peptides were reported with a
maximum expectation value of 0.001, and minimum prospector score of 15. A site localization in peptide (SLIP)
score threshold of 6 was used to determine site-localization. All phosphopeptide spectra reported were
manually inspected for evidence of correct site assignment. Where S or T residues are adjacent, the location of
the phosphosite is ambiguous (see Table S2). All phosphorylation data can be accessed here (or on the MSViewer website with search key “jyovxenjny”).
A supplemental search of the crosslinked peaklists was made for crosslinks that also contained a
phosphorylation site. This search was identical to the previous crosslinking searches except that Phospho (ST)
was included as a variable modification, and the search was limited to the N protein sequence. Search results
containing a phosphorylation site were manually assessed. Only phosphorylation sites that had been
discovered in the phospho search of the linear peptides were considered.
For quantitating the isotopically labeled crosslinks, peak areas were measured from the extracted precursor ion
chromatograms (XICs) using the small molecule interface of Skyline (v20.1.0.155). A Skyline transition list was
generated containing the elemental composition of each distinct peptide pair with both light and heavy BS3
modification and in each charge state detected in the Prospector search. Retention times were present in the
transition list to help with peak detection. Peptide level measurements were imported into R and summarized
at the level of unique residue pairs (“crosslinks”). For each precursor ion, the log2 ratios of heavy to light
peptides were calculated and mean normalized to 0 for each of the two biological replicates and then
transformed into log2 (water / salt) ratios. Weighted t-tests were performed in R.
Drug Screening and Image Processing
For the FDA-approved drug screen, 75 mL of N protein at 16 μM was purified from HEK cells. polyC RNA was
obtained from Sigma. The FDA-Approved Drug Library (TargetMol) has 1,200 compounds of wellcharacterized biological activity. 10 mM compounds were stored in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 384
well plates. For screening plates, 20 μL wash buffer was aliquoted into 384 well, glass-bottomed plates
(Greiner Bio-One) and incubated for 5 min. Buffer was removed, and 0.5 μl of 2 mM compounds were stamped
into 384 well plates with an Analytik-Jena Cybio Well Vario liquid handler. Final concentration of 7.8 µM N
protein and 50 ng/µL polyC RNA were added to each plate. Each well contained 25 μL mixture and 40 µM
compound in the primary screen.
Wells were homogenized with a Bioshake 3000 ELM orbital shaker at 2,400 rpm for 45 s and droplets were
allowed to settle for 1 h before imaging. 4 images (each 224 x 167 µm) were taken at 40x with a Molecular
Devices ImageXpress Micro High Content Imaging System. Images were analyzed with Metamorph Imaging
software calculating droplet count and area. Data was then uploaded to CCDvault for normalization to DMSO
vehicle control wells. Wells that exhibit 3 standard deviations from the untreated sample and as well as others
that produced qualitative morphological changes in N droplets were selected for dose response screening. The
same N protein and RNA were tested against candidate drugs using a 10-point serial dilution starting at 40 µM
using the same procedure. Dose response curves were generated by fitting to the equation:

where C is the concentration of the drug, n is the Hill coefficient, EC50 is half-maximal inhibition concentration,
and y is either the percentage of the area covered by N condensates or the number of N droplets in 0.038 mm2
imaging area.

Vero E6 cells were cultured in phenol-negative DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PS at 37°
with 5% CO2. For drug testing, cells were transferred to glass-bottomed plates (Nunc Lab-Tek, 0.4 mL working
volume) in media without PS and allowed to recover for 24 hours. Cells were transfected with N with a Cterminal GFP tag. For each well, 2 μL PEI (1mg/mL, pH 7.0 in PBS) was dissolved in 200 μL DMEM media and
0.66 μg DNA were dissolved in 200 μL DMEM media. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15
min before being adding it to the cell culture. Cells were allowed to express N-GFP for 48 h; then nilotinib or
DMSO was added to the media and cells were cultured for an additional 24 hours. An hour prior to imaging,
DRAQ5 stain at 1:1000 was added to the media. Cells were imaged live using epifluorescence imaging using
the same laser lines and camera as described above. Puncta were identified in Fiji using the Niblack function
(radius = 30 pixels, parameter 1 = 5). Each measurement of puncta per nucleus represents the number of
detected puncta divided by the number of detected nuclei in a single image. Solidity (area/convex area) was
measured by Fiji. Significance tests were performed in Origin.
