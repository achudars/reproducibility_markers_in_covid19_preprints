With the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic, several variants of the virus are emerging with mutations distributed all over the viral sequence. While most of them are expected to have little to no effects at the phenotype level, some
of these variants presenting specific mutations on the Spike protein are rapidly spreading, making
urgent the need of characterizing their effects on phenotype features like contagiousness and antigenicity. With this aim, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a selected set of
possible Spike variants in order to assess the stabilizing effect of particular amino acid substitutions,
with a special focus on the mutations that are both characteristic of the top three most worrying
variants at the moment, i.e the English, South African and Amazonian ones, and that occur at
the molecular interface between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its human ACE2 receptor. We
characterize these variants’ effect in terms of (i) residues mobility, (ii) compactness, studying the
network of interactions at the interface, and (iii) variation of shape complementarity via expanding
the molecular surfaces in the Zernike basis. Overall, our analyses highlighted greater stability of
the three variant complexes with respect to both the wild type and two negative control systems,
especially for the English and Amazonian variants. In addition, in the three variants, we investigate
the effects a not-yet observed mutation in position 501 could provoke on complex stability. We found
that a phenylalanine mutation behaves similarly to the English variant and may cooperate in further
increasing the stability of the South African one, hinting at the need for careful surveillance for the
emergence of such kind of mutations in the population. Ultimately, we show that the observables we
propose describe key features for the stability of the ACE2-spike complex and can help to monitor
further possible spike variants.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection was firstly observed in late 2019
[1, 2]. In the subsequent months of epidemic spreading,
many SARS-CoV-2 variants, viral sequences characterized by at least one mutation with respect to the original
one, have been detected worldwide [3].
In coronaviruses, mutations naturally occur during viral replication, and despite the fact that coronaviruses
encode for an enzyme that corrects the errors made some
of this mutation are preserved forming new variants. As
for all biological systems, the action of natural selection
eventually tends to fix in the genome the mutations characteristic of those variants that present an increase of the
fitness, and it has been registered that in these months
the rate of emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants is
about two variants per month [4, 5].
This rapid proliferation of variants poses a further
threat for the community as the virus can acquire different phenotypes.
For instance, the main mutation of the B line, involving the amino acid substitution D614G in Spike, is established since March 2020 and it is now largely dominant in
patients [6–8]. This mutation would allow the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of Spike to assume a conformation more suitable to bind Angiotensin-converting en-

zyme 2 (ACE2), and it could be responsible for the increased viral action [9, 10].
More recently, on December 14, 2020, authorities in
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland reported to World Health Organization that a new
variant SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, commonly known as the
English variant, has been identified via viral genomic sequencing [11, 12]. The variant is defined by the presence
of a range of 14 mutations involving amino acid modifications and three deletions, including the spike D614G
mutation. Even if investigations are underway to determine whether this variant is associated with any changes
in antibody response or vaccine efficacy, it seems to be
characterized by an increased transmissibility [13] and
lethality [14], also because it is spreading with very high
speed all over the world.
Among the mutations affecting the spike protein, like
69-70del or P681H, mutation N501Y is located in the
region that directly contacts the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is possible that this mutation could have a direct
effect on the binding affinity between the two proteins
[15].
Furthermore, the importance of this amino acid substitution is confirmed by its presence in two other rapidly
spreading variants, B.1.351 [16] and P.1 [17] (commonly
referred to as South African variant and Amazonian variant, respectively).

These two variants both include other amino acid substitutions in the spike binding site, making clear that this
region is under severe evolutionary pressure. Indeed, selectivity and the affinity of the spike toward its main
receptor, ACE2, remain the crucial factors determining
SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness and virulence.
Even if, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2,
similarly to other coronaviruses [18, 19], is able to bind to
sialoglycan-based receptors in the N-terminal domain [20,
21].
From a molecular point of view, the spike protein of
CoVs, protruding from the viral membrane, not only
plays a crucial role as a fundamental structural protein,
but it also is essential for the interaction between CoV
systems and host cells [22]. Structurally, the spike protein is found in the trimeric complex, each chain composed of two sub-units: S1 and S2. The Receptor Binding
Domain (RBD), located in the S1 domain, is responsible
for viruses’ interaction with receptors on the host cell surface [23]. On the other hand, the S2 subunit is responsible for the fusion between the virus and host membrane,
causing the viral genome to penetrate the host cell’s cytoplasm [24].
Interestingly, the interaction with ACE2 involves the
C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whose
amino acid sequence is well conserved with respect to
SARS-CoV homologous one [25]. Conversely, the Nterminal domain presents some insertions, and these additional surface regions could be used by the virus to
bind other cell receptors, so constituting an additional
cell entry mechanism [26].
Here, we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulation of different systems of the spike-receptor complex, involving mutations at the spike protein interface.
In particular, we both consider single mutations belonging to the binding site of the spike protein for which
the binding affinity experimental data is known, and
we consider the variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently most
widespread in the world. We analyze the mutations for
which binding affinity is known in order to detect the
dynamic-structural properties of the ACE2-spike complex that give the spike protein a greater propensity to
interact with the molecular partner. Only by considering the RBD of the spike protein and the extra-membrane
domain of the ACE2 receptor, we analyze the dynamic
properties of the residues belonging to the two interfaces.
Furthermore, an analysis based on graph theory was performed in order to investigate the stability of the contacts
during molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we analyze the shape complementarity of the two interfaces over
time, using Zernike polynomials to characterize the shape
of each portion of the molecular surface, establishing a
complementarity value between each pair of surface [27].
Also, in this case, we investigate the stability of the geometrical matching between the two interfaces during the
molecular dynamics simulation because stable binding to
the host receptor plays a crucial role for virus entry mechanisms [28].

2

This study shows that the English variant and the
South African variant have structural and dynamic properties similar to the N501F variant, which is experimentally known to be the one with the highest binding affinity with ACE2. This finding invites us to explore the
possible cooperative effect of mutations in the binding region. Therefore, we substituted the F amino acid (Phenylalanine) at position 501 of the spike protein for both
the Amazon variant and the South African variant. The
results obtained from our fully computational approach
show that the presence of the F amino acid in the Amazonian variant would worsen the binding affinity. On the
other hand, the same mutation carried out in addition
to the mutations of the South African variant would increase the stability of the spike-ACE2 complex, suggesting these mutations as a possible worrying variant.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The role of spike mutations in the emerging
variants

Although mutations are showing up all over the SARSCoV-2 viral genome, those taking place on the spike protein are under intense scrutiny as they are expected to
directly impact viral entrance in the host cells, thus on
transmissibility and infectivity. The first notable mutation that has been observed involved residue 614 which
changed from D to G [6]. This mutation even if localized
in a region distant from the binding regions, rapidly fixed
in the population suggesting an indirect effect on the phenotype. A recent computation study highlighted a conformational change driven by the mutation that favors
ACE2 receptor binding, thus explaining the phenotypic
advantage [10].
With the huge spread of the epidemics, other mutations accumulated over the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In particular, a variant of the virus with 6 mutated aminoacid
and 2 deletions in the spike protein emerged in England
in the past mounts. The English variant has the G614D
mutation together with mutations/deletions belonging to
spike protein: 69-70 HV deletion, 144Y deletion, N501Y,
A570D, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H. Specifically,
mutation N501Y and deletions 69-70 attracted much attention since the mutation falls in the receptor-binding
domain while the double deletion interests the N-terminal
domain, which has been demonstrated to bind sialic acidrich attachment factors [20, 21].
To begin with, to assess the variance invasion potential we looked at genomic data taken from infected
individuals divided by geographical location, which is
provided by the regularly updated public web site
(https://cov.lanl.gov). In particular, analyses are
based on 823,121 spike alignment sequences taken at different times and different geographical areas using the
consistency and significance test presented by Korber et
al. [29]. First, we compared sequences carrying the ’wild

type’ residue in position 501 (i.e. N501) with the ones
carrying the 501Y mutation.
Figure 1a displays the changes of relative frequencies
for N501 and Y501 for two-time points separated by two
weeks. The first time point represents all sequences up
to the onset day (at least 15 sequences required with 3
least represented sequences), and the second time point
includes all the sequences acquired at least two weeks
after the onset date (at least 15 sequences required). One
can see that in each country, the variant 501Y is rapidly
spreading.
The significance of the signal is obtained testing
the null hypothesis that the mutation does not affect
the variant fitness and that consequently, the relative
frequency shift must randomly go with equal probability
in each direction. The p-values confirm that in all
continents we observe a systematic increase of the

relative frequency of Y501. Next, we moved to consider
sequences carrying the deletion V70 (taking place on the
glycan-binding domain). Figures 1b-c show respectively
the change in the relative frequency of the deletion
at position 70 constraining respectively for the N501
and Y501 variant; this shows that the deletion of the
70th position increases in relative frequencies at a much
greater rate in the Y501 variant. This suggests that
deletion 70 is driven by the rapid spread of the English
variant, and/or that the Y501 variant gives a stronger
relative change in fitness to the deletion.
Finally, looking at all infection data, we compare
the invasive potential of the different 501 mutations.
The phylogenetic tree in Figure 1a was obtained using
the publicly available interactive visualization platform

spike protein and the ACE2 receptor, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a set of spike
variants in complex with ACE2 and characterized the effects of the different mutations on the stability of the
protein complex.
In particular, we considered the spike protein first detected in Wuhan at the beginning of the epidemics as the
’wild type’ (WT). Starting from the structural complex
comprising the RBD of the WT spike and the human
ACE2 receptor (pdb id: 6m0j), we obtained the RBD
of variant B.1.1.7 (the English variant) mutating residue
501 from amino acid N to Y.
In addition, we also considered four other singlemutated complexes: N501T and N501F, which are expected to display higher affinity; N501D and N501K,
which should exhibit lower stability with respect to the

wild type one [31].
Then we move to consider cases in which three mutations are present in the RBD, i.e. we analyze the South
African and Amazonian variants carrying the mutations K417T-E484K-N501Y and K417N-E484K-N501Y,
respectively.
All considered systems are reported in Table I.
For each considered system, mutations were obtained
using Pymol (see Methods) and a 500 ns-long molecular
dynamics simulation is conducted. To ensure a complete
equilibration of the systems, only configurations after 250
ns are used in the analyses.
The first observable we consider to evaluate the stability of each RBD-ACE2 complex, was the Root Mean
Square Fluctuation (RMSF). In Figure 2a, we show for
each residue, both for spike protein and for the ACE2 re-

ceptor, the RMSF value obtained considering each molecular dynamics simulation at equilibrium. The average of
the RMSF of all contact residues provides information on
the overall mobility of the interface. The binding residues
of ACE2 and spike have a comparable mean fluctuation
value between them (of about 1.25 Å, as the average
of all systems). The negative control 1 and 2 systems
(whose mutations are N501K and N501D, respectively)
are characterized by a higher kd than the WT form of the
spike. This is clearly evident in terms of atomic fluctuation, given that these systems show greater mobility of
the interface residues, with an RMSF average of 1.53 Å
and 1.31 Å, respectively. The system characterized only
by N501Y mutation (UK variant) is the most stable of
all, with an average of 1.01 Å. The Amazon variant and
the South African variant also have a low average fluctuation compared to the other systems, of 1.14±0.23 Å and
1.22±0.20 Å, respectively. A more detailed analysis was
performed on the atomic fluctuation of residue 501. In
all systems, except for the South African variant, residue
501 of the spike protein has a lower average fluctuation
than the average of all residues belonging to the same
interface. In particular, the English variant, the Amazonian variant, and the positive control mutation (N501F)
show a fluctuation of the residue 501 lower than the average of the RMSF values. Indeed, the RMSF value for
residue 501 in these three systems is 1.00, 1.00, and 1.20,
while the average values of RMSF for the three systems
are 1.01±0.16, 1.14±0.23, and 1.25±0.20, respectively.
Therefore, for these three systems, residue 501 is particularly stable with respect to the other residues. On
the contrary, the other systems have a more pronounced
fluctuation of residue 501. Among all, the two negative
control systems, N501K and N501D mutations are characterized by a very high average RMSF value: 1.83 and
2.03 respectively. The results of the analysis of atomic
fluctuation overtime of the interface residues highlight
the stability of systems with higher binding affinity, including the South African and Amazonian variant for
which we have not considered experimental data (since
they are not present here [31]). In order to investigate the
stability of intermolecular interactions during molecular
dynamics, we calculated the contact frequency matrix for
each system. Therefore, we define contact between two
residues if their α-carbon atoms have a distance less than
9 Å. For each matrix element, we then report the contact frequency between each residue of the spike protein

6

and each other of the ACE2 receptor, then subtracting
(to facilitate the comparison) each of these matrices with
that obtained for the WT system (see Methods section).
As shown in Figure 2b, we notice similarities between
some matrices. For example, the matrix relating to the
N501Y system is particularly similar to the N501F system, which is characterized by the highest experimental
binding affinity value. An analysis of the Pearson correlation between each pair of matrices allows us to quantify
this evidence. In Table II the correlation values between
all the contact matrices are shown. Interestingly, the positive control system (characterized by the N501F mutation) has a mean contact map highly correlated with that
of the UK, Amazon, and South African variant, with a
Pearson correlation value of 0.96, 0.92, and 0.85 respectively. The two systems formed by the two mutations
with high Kd (the two negative controls), on the other
hand, show lower correlation values with any other system, with an average of the Pearson coefficient of 0.34
and 0.32 respectively. These results represent the first
level of classification of the mutated systems of this study
and allow us to identify the properties of mean atomic
fluctuation at a single residue level.

C.

Principal Component Analysis of contact
frequency

In order to obtain a more exhaustive overview of the
binding between ACE2 and spike protein, we investigate
the frequency of the contacts for each analyzed system.
To this end, we associate each system to all intermolecular contact pairs, for each of which we consider the percentage of contacts during the simulation. Therefore,
each system is described by a vector of 272 elements,
since the residues of the binding site are 17 belonging to
the spike protein and 16 belonging to the ACE2 receptor (see Methods). The first two principal components
explain 54.4% and 35.3% of the total variance. The projection of each system on the essential plane of the first
two principal components allows to clearly distinguish,
completely unsupervised, the mutations with high affinity from those with low binding affinity. In particular,
the projection along the first principal component shows
a very interesting trend (as shown in Figure 3): the two
mutations of the negative control have a positive value on
the first component (distinguishing themselves from any
other). On the other hand, the first three systems along
this component are the Amazon variant, the English variant, and the positive control (N501F). We also analyze
the loading of each interacting residue pair on the first
principal component. In Figure 3 we show the considered
pairs, given that their projection along the axis of the
first component is high compared to the others (and the
trend of the contact frequency is not trivial between the
different systems). In most cases, the pairs of interacting
residues at the interface show a trend (increasing or decreasing) of the frequency of the contacts for the different

systems. For example, the percentage of contacts during
the simulations of the pair composed of the S 494 residue
of the spike protein and the H 34 residue of the ACE2
receptor (S494-H34), progressively decreases for systems
with low binding affinity. Therefore, this pair is more
stable in high binding affinity systems. With an opposite
trend, the pair of residues G502-Q325 shows an increasing trend, meaning that this is more present for systems
with low binding affinity. This analysis provides information on which pairs of intermolecular interactions are
more stable in high-affinity binding systems and which
pairs, on the other hand, are most present in low-affinity
binding systems.

Graph theory-based analysis of binding site
residues

A higher level of complexity of the binding properties
was addressed by analyzing the organization of interactions between the interface residues. To this end, we
model the interaction between the two proteins as a bipartite network, schematizing each residue as a node of
the network and each intermolecular interaction as an
edge. Only intermolecular interactions were considered
for this analysis, so interactions between two residues belonging to the same protein are not included in the graph
definition. In particular, we define a weighted graph for
each system, weighing each link connecting two residues
with the corresponding contact frequency calculated from
the molecular dynamics, defining, in this case, contact
between two residues if their distance is less than 8.5Å
in agreement with [32]. As an example for a better interpretation of this modeling for the molecular complex, we
report the distances that every residue belonging to the
ACE2 binding site has with the residue 501 of the Spike
protein since this is of primary importance in the variants
considered in this work (see Figure 4). The mean distance
between residue 501 of the spike protein and any other
(within 12 Å) of the ACE2 receptor was calculated. This
analysis shows that the systems with lower experimental
binding affinity are typically characterized by a greater
distance (N501K and N501D single mutation) between
the residues belonging to the binding site of ACE2 and
the residue 501 of the spike protein. Interestingly, the
system with the N501D mutation has a shorter distance

than any other system between residues 501 and residues
37, 38, 39, 41, 42, and 45 of the receptor. Similarly,
for the system having the N501K mutation, it shows the
lowest distance between residue 501 and residue 383, 386,
and 387 belonging to the ACE2 receptor. Extending the
analysis to any other residue of the spike protein interface, we investigate the local organization of the intermolecular contacts through centrality measures. To this
end, both the betweenness centrality and closeness centrality parameters were considered as a local descriptor of
the interaction of each residue, since these are certainly
two of the most widely used descriptors for the centrality
analysis of a node.
In order to compare the different interaction organizations of each molecular system, we performed a clustering analysis considering a single vector for each system, which is composed of the combination of the two
descriptors considered. The profile is relative only to the
residues belonging to the spike interface (see fig 3a).
Also in this analysis, we find a clear separation of mutations with lower binding affinity from the others, showing
the ability of our approach based on molecular dynamics
to distinguish high and low-affinity systems. The WT
form of the complex takes place in an intermediate position between low-affinity and high-affinity mutations. In
particular, the WT system is characterized by a profile
very similar to the N501T mutation, which has the same
amino acid in position 501 of the SARS-CoV system.
On the other side, the Amazon variant and the South
African variant appear to have a very similar organization of contacts with positive control and English variant,
respectively. Interesting to note that the Amazon variant, which is causing an important concern in the world,
is very similar to the system characterized by the single mutation N501F, the one with the best experimental
binding affinity.

E.

Shape variation of binding site region

Finally, we focused on the whole binding region of both
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor and assessed the shape complementarity of the binding site. To
do so, we first expanded the molecular surfaces of the
two molecular partners (see Figure 5a) on the basis of the
3D Zernike moments (see Methods) and then computed

the Euclidean distance between the two sets of invariant descriptors. We repeated the procedure for 250 configurations sampled from the equilibrium of each of the
molecular dynamics simulations we performed. We thus
obtained a distribution of Zernike distances, i.e. of complementarity scores, for each investigated variant. As one
could expect, all distributions are centered around similar
values of complementarity since the overall shape of the
binding site does not vary so much performing a few point
mutations. However, looking at the variance of the distributions for the five single-mutation variants, we found a
similar trend between the experimentally measured complex affinities and the variance of the shape complementarity as one can see from Figure 5b where we compared
the difference in affinity and shape variance of the five investigated variants with respect to the wild type. It is interesting to note that the N501Y variant displays a lower
shape variance with respect to the wild type than the
N501F variant. Unfortunately, as far as our knowledge
goes, no binding affinity data are available for the threemutation variants (i.e. the South African and Amazonian variants). We thus proceeded to compute the shape
variance from the molecular dynamics configurations and
compare them with single-mutation ones. Interestingly,
we found that both variants show a lower variance with
respect to the negative controls (N501D and N501K),
with the South African variant being more motile than
the English one while the Amazonian variant having the
smallest variance (see Figure 5c). This result provides an
important example of the not-trivial effect of cooperativity, in fact, the same mutation (Y501F) gives an opposite
outcome in the two variants, which now differ in terms of
the interactions between a couple of residues 417T-501F
against 417N-501F. Finally, we run two additional molecular dynamics simulations substituting amino acid F to
Y in the two triple-mutated variants in order to check
whether such mutation could bring to an enhancement
in the binding propensity. Looking again at the shape
variance, we observed that the modified South African
and Amazonian variants behave oppositely: while a Y to
F mutation on the 501 residue increases the complementarity variability for the Amazonian variant thus worsening its binding capacity, the same mutation on the South
African one brings a stabilization effect, with the complex maintaining a more stable shape complementarity
during the dynamics.

CONCLUSIONS

The major goals of a virus are replication and spread,
and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is constituting no exception. The vast, worldwide, diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2
epidemics indeed is providing the virus the possibility of
exploring the genomic landscape and accumulating mutations. The resulting viral variants are subject to natural selection so that mutations that increase the diffusion rapidly get fixed in the viral genomic pool. Besides

8

the transmission of the virus itself, antiviral treatments
also contribute to selection. Indeed with the introduction
of vaccines, new mutations inducing escape and resistance to resistant to available treatments producing are
expected to couple with more virulent strains [33, 34].
The new frontier for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic
seems to become even more based on controlling and understanding the accumulation of variations in the SARSCoV-2 genome.
To date, several different variants have already
emerged.
In particular, those with mutations on the spike protein are attracting a lot of attention as this protein is
responsible for the binding to cellular receptor and attachment factors but also the primary target of the antibodies of the immune system.
Here, we deployed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the effect of different possible mutations of the spike residues 417, 484, and 501, which are
the mutations found in the most relevant observed variants. In particular, mutation N501Y has been found in
both the English, South African, and Amazonian variants. Analyzing the equilibrium configurations acquired
by the spike-ACE2 complex in terms of residue fluctuations, networks of contacts, and conservation of shape
complementary of the binding region, we found that indeed mutations on residue 501 strongly influence the dynamical stability of the complex. Most importantly, a
phenylalanine substitution in position 501 increases the
stability of the South African variant via a cooperative
action with residue 417T. In conclusion, our results suggest close surveillance for the emergence of such mutation
to anticipate (and minimize) its effects in the viral spread
and eventual early incorporation of this information into
diagnostic and pharmacological procedures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.

Complex structural data

The complex of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to
human ACE receptor has been taken from the PDB bank
(pdb id: 6m0j). In particular, only the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the spike and the extracellular domain
of ACE2 are considered. Each variant considered in the
present study has been obtained manually mutating the
experimental complex via the Pymol software [35]. All
information about amino acid substitutions is reported
in Table I.

Molecular dynamics simulations

All simulations were performed using Gromacs [36].
Topologies of the system were built using the CHARMM27 force field [37]. The protein was placed in a dodecahedric simulative box, with periodic boundary condi-

tions, filled with TIP3P water molecules [38]. For all
simulated systems, we checked that each atom of the
proteins was at least at a distance of 1.1 nm from the
box borders. Each system was then minimized with the
steepest descent algorithm. Next, a relaxation of water
molecules and thermalization of the system was run in
NVT and NPT environments each for 0.1 ns at 2 fs timestep. The temperature was kept constant at 300 K with
v-rescale thermostat [39]; the final pressure was fixed at
1 bar with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [40].
LINCS algorithm [41] was used to constraint bonds
involving hydrogen atoms. A cut-off of 12 Å was imposed
for the evaluation of short-range non-bonded interactions
and the Particle Mesh Ewald method [42] for the longrange electrostatic interactions. The described procedure

was used for all the performed simulations.

Interface residue definition and contact
probability calculation

For each analyzed complex, the interface was defined
by taking ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike residues whose
α-carbons have a distance lower than 12 Å at time t =
250 ns, that is, after the equilibration phase. To end
with a comparable set for all complexes, we selected the
residues common to all interfaces obtaining 16 residuals
for ACE2 and 17 for the spike protein. For each couple
of interacting residues among the two proteins, we calculated the contact frequency, counting how many times

each couple of residues had a distance lower than 9 Å between two α-carbons in each frame of the dynamics at
equilibrium.

We got a 16x17 matrix for every complex reported in
Table I. Contact matrices shown in Figure 2b are obtained by subtracting the wild type one.

Principal component analysis and clustering

From the contact matrices of all complexes, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) in which
the starting matrix consisted of 7 rows (the variants) and
272 columns (the contact frequencies of each pair of spikeACE2 α-carbons). The clustering analysis was performed
using the ‘hclust’ function of R, preserving the default
clustering algorithm (the “complete” method). We first
computed the contact percentage matrix for each system,

as obtained from the molecular dynamics frames. For
graphics analysis, we define contact between two residues
if the distance between their center is less than 8.5 Å, as
proposed in [32]. Then, we defined a weighted graph for
each matrix and calculated the betweenness centrality
and closeness centrality parameters for each residue.
In particular, the betweenness centrality of a node i is
given by:

bi =

X skl (i)
skl

(1)

k6=i,l6=i

where skl (i) is number of weighted shortest paths (s) that
go from node k to node l passing through node i; while
skl is the total number of weighted shortest paths from
node k to node l.
Similarly, the closeness centrality of a node i is defined by the inverse of the average length (< · >) of the
weighted shortest paths to/from all the other nodes in
the network:
ci =

1
< skl >k6=i,l6=i

(2)

Both quantities were obtained via the corresponding
functions of the ‘igraph’ package of R [43].
For each system, we combined the two vectors (which
have values of betweenness and closeness for single
residues) normalized to 1. We used the Euclidean distance to compare every pair of vectors. Analyses were
performed using R standard libraries [44].

Molecular surface analysis via Zernike descriptors

Given an ACE2-RBD complex simulated in molecular dynamics, for each protein, we calculate separately
the molecular surface using DMS software[45]. Once extracted the portion of protein surface in interaction, with
a voxelization procedure we represent the protein patch
as a 3D function.
This 3D function can be described as a series expansion
on the basis of the 3D Zernike Polynomials[27, 46, 47].
Taking the norm of the expansion coefficients we deal
with an ordered set of numerical descriptors that compactly summarize the shape of the examined molecular
surface.

Indeed, a function f (r, θ, φ) can be written as:

f (r, θ, φ) =

∞ X
n X
l
X

m
Cnlm Znl
(r, θ, φ)

(3)

n=0 l=0 m=−l
m
where Znl
are the 3D Zernike polynomials, while the
coefficients Cnlm are called Zernike moments.
The precision of the description can be selected by
modifying the order of the expansion N. In this work,
we fix N = 20, corresponding to 121 numerical descriptors representing each function.
The 3D Zernike Moments can be seen as:

Z
Cnlm =
|r|≤1

m (r, θ, φ)dr
f (r)Znl

(4)

where Z represent the complex conjugate.
The norms of such moments, with respect to the index
m, are invariant under translation and rotation. Indeed,
the Zernike Descriptors are defined as:

Dnl =|| Cnlm

v
u l
uX
||= t
(Cnlm )2 .

(5)

m=−l

The shape complementarity between 2 surfaces can
be easily evaluated applying a metric between the two
vectors of numbers describing them[48–50]. Indeed, we
adopted the euclidean distance. When 2 surfaces have a
low distance between them, they are characterized by a
similar shape and therefore they are suitable for binding.
