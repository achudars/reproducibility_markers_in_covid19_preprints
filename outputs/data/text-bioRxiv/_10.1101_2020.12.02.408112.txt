Abstract
Antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 could improve treatment of COVID-19. We evaluated the
efficacy of clinically relevant hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PI) against SARSCoV-2 and their interactions with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved for treatment of COVID19. HCV PI showed differential potency in VeroE6 cell-based antiviral assays based on detection of
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Linear PI boceprevir, telaprevir and narlaprevir had 50% effective
concentrations (EC50) of ~40 µM. Among macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir,
glecaprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir and deldeprevir, simeprevir had the highest (EC50
15 µM) and glecaprevir the lowest (EC50 >178 µM) potency. Acyclic PI asunaprevir and
faldaprevir had EC50 of 72 and 23 µM, respectively. ACH-806, an HCV NS3 protease co-factor
NS4A inhibitor, had EC50 of 46 µM. For selected PI, potency was similar in human hepatoma
Huh7.5 cells. Selectivity indexes, based on antiviral and cell viability assays, were highest for linear
PI. In combination with remdesivir, linear PI boceprevir and narlaprevir showed antagonism, while
macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir and grazoprevir showed synergism with drug reduction
indexes of up to 27 for simeprevir. Treatment of infected cultures with equipotent concentrations
(1-fold EC50) of HCV PI revealed minor differences in barrier to SARS-CoV-2 escape. Complete
viral suppression was achieved treating with ≥3-fold EC50 boceprevir or combination of 1-fold
EC50 simeprevir with 0.4-fold EC50 remdesivir, not leading to significant viral suppression in
single treatments. Considering potency, human plasma concentrations and synergism with
remdesivir, simeprevir seemed the most promising compound for optimization of future antiviral
treatments of COVID-19.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded
RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family, which emerged in humans in 2019 most likely originating
from a bat-borne virus.1–3 SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a multisystemic disease with initial symptoms mostly localizing to the respiratory tract. Until the end of
November 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for >60 million infected, >1.4
million deaths, and an unknown number of individuals suffering from long-term health effects.4–8
Repurposing of drugs approved for other medical indications is promoted as a time-saving approach
to identification of urgently needed treatments. At present, the only drug approved for treatment of
COVID-19 that directly targets SARS-CoV-2 proteins is remdesivir, an inhibitor of the viral
nonstructural protein (nsp) 12 polymerase, originally being an investigational broad-spectrum
antiviral previously evaluated for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and ebola
infection.9
Another important target of antiviral drugs are viral proteases, which are essential for cleavage of
viral polyproteins into functional proteins.10–12 The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) or 3
chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a cysteine protease corresponding to nsp5. Mpro mediates 11
cleavage events at conserved sites of the polyprotein and is thus essential for viral replication.13–15
In addition, Mpro has no cellular homologues and is highly conserved between different
coronaviruses, making it an interesting drug target.16
Hepatitis C virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, which
was classified into 8 major genotypes and various subtypes.17,18 The main HCV protease,
nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease.19–21 Together with its essential
co-factor, NS4A, it mediates 4 cleavage events of the polyprotein. Inhibitors of this protease are
important components of recently developed highly efficient HCV treatment regimens based on
combination of antivirals directly targeting HCV proteins.22
Initially developed HCV protease inhibitors (PI) showed a linear structure and included boceprevir
and telaprevir, which were approved in 2011 in the U.S. and EU, as well as narlaprevir, approved in
2016 in Russia, for treatment of chronic HCV infection (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary
Table 1). Subsequently, PI with macrocyclic structure, including simeprevir, paritaprevir,
grazoprevir, glecaprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir and deldeprevir were developed.
These macrocyclic PI were approved between 2013 and 2019 in the U.S., EU or China, with
exception of vaniprevir, only approved in Japan and deldeprevir, which was never approved. Of the

2 acyclic PI, asunaprevir and faldaprevir, asunaprevir was approved in Japan, Canada and China,
while faldaprevir was not approved. Several of the initially developed PI were subsequently
discontinued due to the development of more efficient PI with increased activity against the
different HCV genotypes (Supplementary Table 1). At present clinical use in the U.S., Europe and
China is focused on inhibitor combinations, including grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir.
Additionally, in China, inhibitor combinations including paritaprevir, danoprevir or asunaprevir are
used in the clinic.
While an inhibitor of HCV NS4A (ACH-806) was tested in clinical phase 1 trials, development was
halted due to reversible nephrotoxicity.23,24
In this study we investigated in vitro efficacy of a panel of HCV PI, including all clinically
approved compounds and selected compounds tested in clinical studies, against SARS-CoV-2. We
further evaluated efficacy of an HCV NS4A inhibitor. In concentration-response antiviral assays we
determined 50% effective concentrations (EC50), 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) and
selectivity indexes (SI). Moreover, we evaluated interactions with remdesivir for selected linear and
macrocyclic compounds. Finally, in longer-term cultures we evaluated selected inhibitors for their
barrier to viral escape.

Results
Differential potency of clinically relevant HCV protease inhibitors and potency of an HCV
NS4A inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. To determine the potency of a panel of HCV PI
and an HCV NS4A inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2, we developed a cell-based antiviral assay in 96well plates, adapting an assay previously developed to determine potency of HCV PI against
HCV.24–31 First, concentration response studies were carried out in VeroE6 cells using inhibitor
concentrations not resulting in reduction of cell viability (relative cell viability >90%). All tested
inhibitors were able to inhibit the virus with EC50 values in the micromolar range, with exception
of glecaprevir, voxilaprevir and deldeprevir, where EC50 values could not be determined due to
cytotoxicity of the drugs or antiviral activity of the diluent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at high drug
concentrations (Figure 1, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2). The linear PI boceprevir, telaprevir and
narlaprevir showed comparable potencies with EC50 values of ̴ 40 µM. Among the macrocyclic PI,
simeprevir showed the highest potency with an EC50 of 15 µM. Further, paritaprevir had an EC50
of 22 µM, while grazoprevir and vaniprevir had EC50 values of 42 and 51 µM, respectively.
Finally, EC50 was 87 µM for danoprevir. For the acyclic PI, faldaprevir (EC50 23 µM) was more
potent than asunaprevir (EC50 72 µM).
To confirm potency of the tested PI in human cells, selected PI were studied in similar assays in
human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. In these assays, boceprevir, simeprevir and grazoprevir showed
similar concentration response curves and EC50 values as in VeroE6 cells (Figure 2, Table 1).
All inhibitors were diluted in DMSO. At the applied DMSO dilutions, no antiviral effect was
observed in VeroE6 and Huh7.5 cells (Supplementary Figure 2); in Figure 1 and 2, drug
concentrations at which DMSO was expected to induce antiviral effects are indicated.
Cell viability assays were carried out for all studied drugs to determine their level of in vitro
cytotoxicity and CC50 values. In these assays drug concentrations were used at which no DMSO
induced cytotoxicity was observed (Supplementary Figure 2); in Figure 1 and 2, drug
concentrations at which DMSO was expected to induce cytotoxicity are indicated. In VeroE6 cells,
the linear PI showed the lowest cytotoxicity with all CC50 values above 200 µM (>1214, >432 and
269 µM for boceprevir, telaprevir and narlaprevir, respectively) (Figure 1, Table 1, Supplementary
Figure 3). Among the macrocyclic inhibitors, grazoprevir, glecaprevir and danoprevir showed the
lowest cytoxicity with CC50 above 200 µM. Paritaprevir and vaniprevir showed intermediate
cytotoxicity with CC50 between 100 and 200 µM, while simeprevir, voxilaprevir and deldeprevir
showed the highest cytotoxicity with CC50 between 50 and 100 µM. Cell viability assays carried

out in Huh7.5 cells using boceprevir, telaprevir and grazoprevir showed similar results (Figure 2,
Table 1, Supplementary Figure 4).
Based on these assays, the linear inhibitors had the highest selectivity indexes (SI=CC50/EC50),
>27.6 for boceprevir, >10.8 for telaprevir and 7.3 for narlaprevir (Table 1). Of the macrocyclic
inhibitors, paritaprevir and grazoprevir had the highest SI (5.6 and 5.7, respectively), while
simeprevir and vaniprevir had slightly lower SI of 3.9 and 3.4, respectively. For glecaprevir,
voxilaprevir, danoprevir, and deldeprevir SI could not be determined. For the acyclic inhibitors, SI
values were 6.3 for faldaprevir and 3.7 for asunaprevir. Finally, SI values calculated based on
assays in Huh7.5 cells were comparable to those based on assays in VeroE6 cells (Table 1).
For the HCV NS4A inhibitor ACH-806, in VeroE6 cells EC50 was 46 µM, CC50 was >429 µM
and SI was >9.3 (Figure 1, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 3).
HCV PI showed differential interactions with remdesivir. To study interactions between
selected PI and remdesivir, 96-well based synergy assays were carried out using the method of
Chou and Talalay32,33, as described in Materials and Methods, and as previously applied for studies
on HCV.26 SARS-CoV-2 infected VeroE6 cells were treated with selected PI singly, in combination
with remdesivir and with remdesivir alone using dilution series, which were chosen based on
determined EC50 values (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 5), and using fixed concentration ratios.
For each treatment condition, the inhibition percentage was determined as a fractional effect (Fa)
value. Using the CompuSyn software, Fa values were plotted against the concentrations of the
single inhibitors and combinations of inhibitors, resulting in concentration-Fa curves (Figure 3A).
Additionally, combination indexes (CI) were calculated for generation of Fa-CI plots and FaLog10CI plots (Figure 3B and C). CI values <0.9 suggested synergism and CI values ≥1.1 suggested
antagonism, while CI values ≥0.9 and <1.1 suggested nearly additive effects; categories for the
interaction level are further specified in Materials and Methods and in Figure 4. Lastly, drug
reduction indexes (DRI) were calculated for generation of Fa-DRI plots and Fa-Log10DRI plots
(Figure 3D and E). DRI values indicated how many folds the concentration of each inhibitor of the
tested combination could be reduced due to synergism. Obtained CI and DRI values are
summarized in Figure 4.
For the linear inhibitors boceprevir and narlaprevir, Fa-CI plots indicated at least moderate
antagonism at all key Fa values, with all CI values being at least 1.4 (Figure 3B and C and Figure
4). In more detail, for boceprevir, at key Fa values antagonism was suggested by CI values of 1.7 to
1.9, and at Fa values of 0.23 to 0.98 at experimental datapoints mostly antagonism was suggested

by CI values of 1.5 to 2.9. For narlaprevir, at key Fa values mostly antagonism was suggested by CI
values of 1.5 and 1.6, and at Fa values 0.03 to 0.99 at experimental datapoints mostly antagonism
was suggested by CI values of 1.5 to 2.0.
In line with the observed antagonism, combinations of linear PI boceprevir or narlaprevir with
remdesivir showed no or only little drug reduction potential (Figure 3D and E and Figure 4). In
more detail, in Fa-DRI plots DRI values for boceprevir + remdesivir were close to 1 suggesting no
dose reduction potential for boceprevir or remdesivir when used in combination. For narlaprevir +
remdesivir, at key Fa values DRI values for narlaprevir were 2.1 to 2.5, and at Fa values 0.03 to
0.99 from experimental datapoints DRI values were 1.6 to 4.4 suggesting a low drug reduction
potential of up to 4-fold at relatively high inhibitor concentrations. DRI values for remdesivir were
close to 1 suggesting no dose reduction potential.
In contrast, for the macrocyclic inhibitors simeprevir, paritaprevir and grazoprevir Fa-CI plots
suggested synergism with remdesivir (Figure 3B and C and Figure 4). In more detail, for
simeprevir, at key Fa values synergism was suggested by CI values of 0.6, and at Fa values of 0.21
to 0.99 from experimental datapoints, mostly synergism was suggested by CI values of 0.3 to 0.6.
Similarly, for paritaprevir, at key Fa values mostly moderate synergism was suggested by CI values
of 0.7 and 0.8, and at Fa values of 0.01 to 0.99 from experimental data points, mostly synergism
was suggested by CI values of 0.3 and 0.5. For grazoprevir at key Fa values synergism was
suggested by CI values of 0.6, and at Fa values of 0.13 to 0.99 obtained at experimental datapoints
mostly synergism was suggested by CI values of 0.4 to 0.6.
In line with the observed synergism, combinations of macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir or
grazoprevir with remdesivir showed significant drug reduction potential (Figure 3D and E and
Figure 4). In more detail, for simeprevir + remdesivir, at key Fa values DRI values for simeprevir
were 14.3 to 15.8, and at Fa values of 0.21 to 0.99 from experimental datapoints DRI values were
7.7 to 27, suggesting a drug reduction potential of up to 27-fold for simeprevir at relatively high
inhibitor concentrations. DRI for remdesivir were significantly lower, with DRI values of 1.8 to 2.0
at key Fa values and DRI values of 0.9 to 3.2 at Fa values of 0.21 to 0.99 from experimental
datapoints, suggesting a drug reduction potential of up to 3-fold for remdesivir at relatively high
inhibitor concentrations.
For paritaprevir + remdesivir, at key Fa values DRI values for paritaprevir were 2.5 to 4.9, and at Fa
values of 0.01 to 0.99 from experimental datapoints DRI values were 1.2 to 10.9, suggesting a drug
reduction potential of up to 11-fold for paritaprevir at relatively high inhibitor concentrations. DRI

for remdesivir were lower, with DRI values of 1.5 to 2.8 at key Fa values and DRI values of 0.7 to
6.1 at Fa values of 0.01 to 0.99 from experimental datapoints, suggesting drug reduction potential of
up to 6-fold for remdesivir at relatively high inhibitor concentrations.
Lastly, for grazoprevir + remdesivir, at key Fa values DRI values for grazoprevir were 3.9 to 5.0,
and at Fa values of 0.13 to 0.99 from experimental datapoints DRI values were 2.5 to 15.8,
suggesting a drug reduction potential of up to 16-fold for grazoprevir at relatively high inhibitor
concentrations. DRI for remdesivir were lower, with DRI values of 2.5 to 3.0 at key Fa values and
DRI values of 1.2 to 5.9 at Fa values of 0.13 to 0.99 from experimental datapoints, suggesting a
drug reduction potential of up to 6-fold for remdesivir at relatively high inhibitor concentrations.
DMSO used at dilutions applied in cultures treated with inhibitor combinations did not show
antiviral effects in VeroE6 cells (Supplementary Figure 2). In addition, cell viability assays revealed
that the applied PI + remdesivir combinations did not result in cytotoxicity in VeroE6 cells
(Supplementary Figure 6).
HCV PI showed small differences in barrier to escape of SARS-CoV-2. In order to investigate
their barriers to escape, all PI except glecaprevir, voxilaprevir and deldeprevir, for which no EC50
could be determined, were used for longer-term treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected VeroE6 cells in
culture flasks at the highest possible equipotent concentration (1-fold EC50) according to predicted
cytotoxicity (Figure 1, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 3). In the nontreated control cultures,
infection spread to 50% of culture cells on day 1 and to 90% of culture cells on day 3 post infection,
as estimated by immunostaining for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Figure 5). Following day 3,
typically massive virus induced cell death was observed in these control cultures. For all PI treated
cultures (Figure 5), initial viral suppression was observed with 10-30% infected culture cells on day
1 post infection and treatment initiation. On day 3, only narlaprevir, grazoprevir, vaniprevir,
asunaprevir and faldaprevir treated cultures showed viral suppression with infection of 10-50% of
culture cells, while in boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir and danoprevir treated cultures
90% of culture cells were infected. On day 5, virus spread to 90% of culture cells in grazoprevir
treated cultures, while cultures treated with vaniprevir and asunaprevir were closed due to massive
cell death, assumed to be due to PI induced cytotoxicity, possibly enhanced by SARS-CoV-2
infection. On day 7, in narlaprevir and faldaprevir treated cultures 60% of culture cells were
infected; these cultures were closed on day 9 due to massive cell death.
Boceprevir had the potential to completely suppress viral infection in vitro. As suboptimal viral
suppression was observed under treatment with 1-fold EC50, we chose the PI with the highest SI to

enable longer-term treatment at higher fold EC50 concentrations. VeroE6 cells infected with SARSCoV-2 were treated with 1-, 1.5-, 2-, 2.5, 3- and 5-fold EC50 of boceprevir (Figure 6). Treatment
with 1- and 1.5-fold EC50 of boceprevir only had a minor impact on viral spread on day 1 post
infection and treatment initiation, while 90% of culture cells became infected on day 3, as observed
for nontreated control cells. Also, in cultures treated with 2 and 2.5-fold EC50, 90% of culture cells
became infected on day 5. In contrast, treatment with 3- and 5-fold EC50 resulted in sustained viral
suppression with no evidence of infected cells in the culture treated with 3-fold EC50 from day 3
and in the culture treated with 5-fold EC50 from day 1 during a follow up period of 7 and 17 days,
respectively. In addition, from cultures treated with 3- and 5-fold EC50 on day 5 and day 3,
respectively, replicate cultures receiving no treatment were derived, which did not show any
infected cells during a follow up period of 10 days, suggesting that the infection was cured under
these treatments.
Simeprevir in combination with remdesivir completely suppressed viral infection in vitro. To
further study and confirm the interactions of PI with remdesivir, 2 PI with apparent differential
interactions with remdesivir were selected for longer-term treatment of SARS-CoV-2. VeroE6 cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 were treated with the PI boceprevir or simeprevir singly, remdesivir
singly or either PI in combination with remdesivir. Inhibitor concentrations were selected to confer
suboptimal effects in order to rule out viral suppression by treatment with single inhibitors.
Equipotent concentrations of PI were used based on data shown in Figures 1 and 5. For remdesivir,
potency was evaluated based on concentration response curves obtained from data shown in Figure
3 and Supplementary Figure 5, and in addition based on pilot longer-term treatment assays (data not
shown). Treatment with remdesivir, boceprevir or simeprevir singly as well as treatment with
boceprevir + remdesivir had none or only a minor impact on viral spread on day 1 post infection
and treatment initiation, while 80 to 90% of culture cells became infected on day 3, as observed for
nontreated control cells (Figure 7). In contrast, in cultures treated with simeprevir + remdesivir
complete and sustained viral suppression was achieved with no evidence of infection from day 1
during a follow up period of 15 days. In addition, to confirm complete viral suppression, from this
culture a replicate culture receiving no treatment was derived on day 5, which did not show any
infected cells during a follow up period of 19 days.

Discussion
We provided a head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of a panel of clinically relevant HCV PI,
including all approved PI, against SARS-CoV-2 in cell-based assays. In short-term antiviral assays,
PI showed differential potency with EC50 values between 15 µM (simeprevir) and >178 µM
(glecaprevir). Detailed short-term synergy studies with a PI sub-panel revealed PI structure
dependent interactions with remdesivir, with linear inhibitors showing antagonism and macrocyclic
inhibitors showing synergism. In longer-term cultures, at relatively low equipotent concentrations
PI showed small differences regarding barrier to escape. For boceprevir, a relatively high SI
facilitated treatment with higher concentrations revealing its potential to completely suppress viral
infection. Further, combination of simeprevir and remdesivir suppressed viral infection at relatively
low inhibitor concentrations, shown to be subtherapeutic in single treatments.
EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 were in the micromolar range, with the lowest EC50 (15 µM for
simeprevir) approaching EC50 of remdesivir, determined to be 2.5 µM in this study, which was in
line with previously reported results.34,35 However, EC50 of PI against SARS-CoV-2 were higher
than EC50 against HCV: Initially developed HCV PI such as boceprevir and simeprevir were ̴10to 1,000-fold less potent, while optimized HCV PI such as grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir
were ̴ 1,000- to 100,000-fold less potent against SARS-CoV-2 than against different HCV
isolates.24,26–28,30,36–38 Boceprevir showed the highest SI of >27.6, while simeprevir showed one of
the lowest SI of 3.9. Of note, some clinically relevant drugs such as digoxin have low therapeutic
breadth with SI as low as 2,39 and simeprevir has proven safe in clinical practice. However, to
estimate the clinical potential of inhibitors, comparison of their EC50 with clinically achievable
plasma and tissue concentrations is more relevant than comparison with in vitro CC50 values. For
most HCV PI, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were significantly lower than the determined
EC50 values (Supplementary Table 2). The most favorable Cmax/EC50 ratio was found for
simeprevir (Cmax/EC50 of ~1), followed by faldaprevir (Cmax/EC50 of ~0.2), as well as
boceprevir, telaprevir and vaniprevir (Cmax/EC50 of ~0.1). For HCV PI detailed information on
liver concentrations is available and in general these are higher than plasma concentrations: For
faldaprevir, boceprevir, telaprevir and vaniprevir liver concentrations are ~32-, ~30-, ~35-, and 20to 280-fold higher than plasma concentrations, and thus ~6-, ~2.3-. 4.6-, and up to 36-fold higher
than EC50 values, respectively.31,40,41 For simeprevir, liver concentrations are 20- to 40-fold higher
than plasma concentrations and thus up to 39-fold higher than EC50 values.42 In rats, following a
single oral administration of simeprevir, concentrations in the intestine, which is permissive to

SARS-CoV-2 infection,43 were up to 128-fold higher than in the plasma, while concentrations in
other tissues were roughly equal to plasma concentrations.44 To further estimate the clinical
potential of simeprevir for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 it would be relevant to determine
concentrations in relevant tissues such as in the lungs and the kidneys in humans following multiple
doses in steady state.45
At clinically achievable tissue concentrations, inhibitor efficacy can be improved by combination
treatments with synergistic and thus drug saving effects as reported here for the macrocyclic PI
simeprevir, paritaprevir and grazoprevir in combination with remdesivir and as recently suggested
by Lo et al. for simeprevir in combination with remdesivir, providing a less detailed analysis than in
this study.46 Of note, Hu et al. recently reported additive effects of boceprevir and remdesivir in
short-term assays based on determination of cytopathic effects.47 However, our extensive results in
short-term assays based on detection of viral protein followed by application of a highly relevant
method for synergy evaluation, clearly demonstrated that the mode of interaction between PI and
remdesivir depended on the PI structure. Thus, the linear PI boceprevir and narlaprevir showed
mostly antagonism, while macrocyclic PI mostly showed synergism with up to 27-fold drug
reduction effects for simeprevir. We confirmed these PI structure dependent interactions with
remdesivir in a longer-term treatment assay where combination of boceprevir with remdesivir did
not result in additive or synergistic effects, while for combination of simeprevir and remdesivir
synergistic effects were observed. This structure dependence remains to be explained, however, it
could be caused by differential cellular uptake or metabolization. Further, simeprevir might target
the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase in addition to Mpro, potentially by a different mechanism than
remdesivir, which might explain the observed synergy.46 Finally, PI were suggested to affect innate
immunity, as well as alternative viral targets, which could provide the basis for the observed
differences in interactions with remdesivir.48–68
While remdesivir is the only antiviral directly targeting SARS-CoV-2 that is approved for treatment
of patients with COVID-19, its clinical efficacy has recently been questioned.9,69–73 Relatively
limited clinical efficacy compared to high in vitro efficacy of remdesivir34,35 might be due to its
poor distribution to the lungs.45 Improving drug formulation including development of inhalable
formulations and combination with simeprevir might have the potential to increase clinical efficacy
of remdesivir.
While carrying out this study, several research articles addressing a potential effect of HCV PI on
SARS-CoV-2 were published. Using in silico modelling approaches, at least 21 studies predicted

binding of different HCV PI to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.48–60,62–68,74 In several of these studies HCV PI
were identified as top candidates following screening of large drug libraries, however, some of
these studies also yielded contradictory results. Of these studies, 10 identified
simeprevir50,53,58,60,62,63,65–68, 5 paritaprevir49,53,55,63,66, 3 glecaprevir54–56, telaprevir48,53,64,

vaniprevir48, narlaparevir48 and grazoprevir52 to bind Mpro. Recently, 4 groups reported studies of
HCV PI voxilaprevir, boceprevir and simeprevir in cell-based antiviral assays. In line with our
findings for a different SARS-CoV-2 strain, voxilaprevir did not have significant antiviral effects,75
while boceprevir47,59,76 and simeprevir46 had antiviral effects: In VeroE6 cells, boceprevir inhibited
the SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 with EC50 of 1-2 µM76 and the Wuhan strain with EC50
of 16 µM59, while simeprevir inhibited the BetaCoV/Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020 strain with
EC50 of 4 µM.46 While EC50 reported in these studies and our study are in the same range, slightly
higher EC50 values observed in our study are most likely caused by differences in experimental
assay conditions. In this study, we used a recently developed treatment assay based on
quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressing cells detected by immunostaining,
while other groups used assays based on quantification of viral RNA copies, virus induced
cytopathogenic effects, or reduction of viral yields. Importantly, we recorded similar EC50 values
in monkey VeroE6 cells and human Huh7.5 cells validating VeroE6 cells for the study of HCV PI.
HCV PI were designed and optimized to bind the HCV NS3 protease. In modelling studies, 3D
similarity between the HCV NS3 protease and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were reported48,60 even though
sequence homology is low. While both viral proteases are chymotrypsin like proteases, the HCV
NS3 protease has a larger and more shallow binding groove.59 Boceprevir was confirmed to target
Mpro, as it inhibited Mpro in enzymatic assays59,76 and the Mpro - boceprevir crystal structure was
solved.59,77 Simeprevir also inhibited Mpro in enzymatic assays46,76, however, with relatively low
efficacy.46,59 Based on this finding, Lo et al. investigated alternative targets and found simeprevir to
also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase in enzymatic assays.46 Thus, simeprevir might have a dual
mechanism of action. It should be noted that simeprevir was also described to impact cellular innate
immune responses61 and that alternative viral targets, including nsp3 (papain like protease domain),
nsp12 (polymerase), nsp13 (helicase), nsp14 (exonuclease and methyltransferase), nsp15
(endoribonuclease), nsp16 (2’-o-ribose methyltransferase), as well as structural proteins N (capsid)
and Spike, were suggested for paritaprevir, grazoprevir and simeprevir by modelling studies.53,67,78–

Future detailed molecular studies are required to fully define the viral targets of different HCV

PI.
Finally, we report antiviral activity of the HCV NS4A inhibitor ACH-806. Future studies are
required to define the SARS-CoV-2 target of this compound and to investigate its potential to
inform design of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.
In conclusion, following initial partially contradictory reports suggesting efficacy of selected HCV
PI against SARS-CoV-2, we here provide a head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of a panel of
clinically relevant HCV PI against SARS-CoV-2, including detailed studies of interaction with
remdesivir. Given its favorable potency, its comparatively high human plasma and tissue
concentrations, and its observed synergy with remdesivir, simeprevir might be a lead candidate for
design of optimized coronavirus inhibitors and might have direct clinical relevance.

Materials and Methods.
Cell cultivation. African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (gift from J. Dubuisson) and human
hepatoma Huh7.5 cells83 were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum
(Sigma, Saint Louis Missouri, USA) and 100 U/mL penicillin with 100µL streptomycin
(Gibco/Invitrogen corporation, Carlsbad, California, USA). Cells were split every 2-3 days with
trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) to maintain a subconfluent monolayer.
Virus isolate. The corona virus isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020 was
derived from a swab sample from a Danish patient that was passaged in VeroE6 cells. For the
experiments presented here we used a sequence confirmed 2nd viral passage stock with an
infectivity titer of 5.5 log10 TCID50/mL.34
Inhibitors. All inhibitors were purchased from Acme Bioscience (Palo Alto, California, USA) and
dissolved in DMSO (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA).
Concentration-response antiviral treatment assays for evaluation of inhibitor potency. 96well-based short-term antiviral treatment assays in VeroE6 cells and Huh7.5 cells were developed
based on assays previously established for determination of the potency of HCV PI against HCV.24–
31

Concentration-response antiviral treatment assays in VeroE6 cells. VeroE6 cells were seeded at
10,000 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark).
The following day medium was changed to 50 µL fresh medium and cells were inoculated with
SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020 at MOI 0.0016 by adding 50 µL virus stock
diluted in medium to each well. Following 1-hour incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2, infected cells
were treated with a dilution series of inhibitors by adding 50 µL medium with inhibitor resulting in
the specified concentrations. Alternatively, cells were treated with a dilution series of DMSO alone
serving as a control for antiviral activity of DMSO. All concentrations of inhibitor were tested in 7
replicates; 14 infected and nontreated and 12 noninfected and nontreated replicates were included in
each assay. After 46-50 hours incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2, cells were subjected to
immunostaining for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and evaluated as described below.
Concentration-response antiviral treatment assays in Huh7.5 cells. Huh7.5 cells were seeded at
9,000 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The following day
cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020 at MOI 0.0198 (based
on the infectivity titer determined in VeroE6 cells) by exchanging the medium with 50 µL virus

stock diluted in medium. After 1-hour incubation, infected cells were treated with a dilution series
of inhibitor by adding 50 µL medium with inhibitor resulting in the specified concentrations.
Alternatively, cells were treated with a dilution series of DMSO alone. After 70 to 74 hours
incubation, cells were subjected to immunostaining for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and
evaluated as described below.
Immunostaining and evaluation of 96-well plates. Cells were fixed and virus was inactivated by
submersion into methanol (J.T.Baker, Gliwice, Poland) for 20 minutes at room temperature. For
immunostaining for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, plates were washed 2 times with PBS-tween
PBS (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri). Then,
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by adding H2O2 and incubating for 10 minutes
followed by 2 more washes with PBS-tween and blocking by PBSK PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.2% skim milk (Easis, Aarhus, Denmark) for
30 minutes. Next, plates were emptied and incubated with primary antibody SARS-CoV-2 spike
chimeric monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological #40150-D004, Beijing, China) diluted 1:5,000 in
PBSK for 2 hours at room temperature. Then plates were washed 2 times with PBS-tween and
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with secondary antibody F(ab’)2-Goat anti-human IgG Fc
Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, HRP (Invitrogen#A24476, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or Goat
F(ab’)2 Anti-Human IgG – Fc (HRP), preadsorbed (Abcamab#98595, Cambridge, UK), diluted
1:2,000 in PBSK. Finally, plates were washed 2 times with PBS-tween, and SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein positive cells were stained using DAB substrate BrightDAB kit (Immunologic # BS04-110,
Duiven, Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Plates were evaluated by automated
counting of single SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein positive cells using an ImmunoSpot series 5 UV
Analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH, Bonn, Germany).84 The mean of counts from noninfected and
nontreated wells, which was usually <50, was subtracted from counts of infected wells. Counts
from infected and treated wells were related to the mean count of the 14-replicate infected
nontreated wells to calculate % residual infectivity; mean counts of infected nontreated wells were
3,000-4,000 for VeroE6 cells and 1,000-2,000 for Huh7.5 cells. Datapoints are given as means of 7
replicates with SEM. Sigmoidal concentration response curves were fitted and EC50 values
calculated as described previously using Graphpad Prism 8.0.0 with a bottom constraint of 0
applying the formula Y= Top/(1+10(Log10EC50-X)*HillSlope).31,85 Representative images from
concentration-response antiviral treatment assays are shown by Gilmore, Zhou et al.86

Analysis of interactions of PI and remdesivir. Synergy versus antagonism of selected PI in
combination with remdesivir for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated using the method of
Chou and Talalay33 and CompuSyn freeware (ComboSyn Inc.)32 based on protocols previously
established for HCV.26 The experimental setup was similar to that of the concentration-response
antiviral treatment assays described above. In brief, VeroE6 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per
well in 96-well flat-bottom plates, medium was changed to 50 µL fresh medium, and cells were
inoculated with SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020 at MOI 0.0016 by adding 50 µL
virus stock diluted in medium to each well. Following 1-hour incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2,
infected cells were treated with a dilution series of inhibitors by adding 50 µL medium with
inhibitor resulting in the specified concentrations. Alternatively, cells were treated with a dilution
series of DMSO alone serving as a control for antiviral activity of DMSO. Regarding inhibitor
treatment, dilution series of selected PI alone, remdesivir alone or a combination of PI and
remdesivir were used that were based on EC50 values against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, for inhibitors
and combinations of inhibitors 1.25- to 2-fold dilution series with at least 6 different dilutions were
applied spanning the respective EC50 values aiming at achieving inhibition values ranging between
1 and 99%. For combination treatments the same PI and remdesivir concentrations as used in single
treatments were applied with a fixed ratio. All treatment conditions were tested in 6 or 7 replicates
including 21 to 70 infected and nontreated replicates per experiment (with at least 7 replicates per
experimental plate) and 12 noninfected and nontreated replicates per experimental plate. After 4650 hours incubation, infected cells were visualized by immunostaining for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein and plates were evaluated by automated counting of single SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
positive cells, as described above. Counts from infected and treated wells were related to the mean
of counts from all infected nontreated wells included in the same experiment to calculate %
inhibition values which were entered into CompuSyn as fractional effect (designated Fa) values,
ranging from 0.01 to 0.99. For each inhibitor or inhibitor combination 6-10 datapoints were entered
based on 6-10 tested concentrations. The software was then used to determine (i) concentrationeffect curves for single and combination treatments, (ii) combination index (CI) values and curves
in relation to Fa values, and (iii) drug reduction index (DRI) values and curves in relation to Fa
values. CI values were used to grade synergism and antagonism in accordance to suggestions by
CompuSyn: CI<0.1, very strong synergism; 0.1≤CI<0.3, strong synergism; 0.3≤CI<0.7, synergism;
0.7≤CI<0.85, moderate synergism; 0.85≤CI<0.9, slight synergism; 0.9≤CI<1.1, nearly additive;
1.1≤CI<1.2, slight antagonism; 1.2≤CI<1.45, moderate antagonism; 1.45≤CI<3.3, antagonism;

3.3≤CI<10, strong antagonism; CI≥10, very strong antagonism. DRI values were used to describe
how many folds the concentration of each inhibitor could be reduced due to synergism during
combination treatment and at given levels of inhibition, compared to each inhibitor administered
alone.
Cell viability assays. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of the inhibitors and DMSO, cell viability was
monitored using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). VeroE6 cells and Huh7.5 cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates at
10,000 and 9,000 cells per well, respectively, and the following day treated with dilution series of
inhibitors or combinations of inhibitors, by adding 100 µL of medium containing inhibitors at the
specified concentrations or DMSO alone at the specified dilutions. After 46-50 hours for VeroE6
cells and after 70-74 hours for Huh7.5 cells, cell viability was evaluated following the
manufacturer’s guidelines. In brief, 20 µL CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent was added
to each well and plates were then incubated for 1 to 3 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. After incubation,
for each well absorbance at 492 nm was recorded by use of a FLUOstar OPTIMA 96-well plate
reader (BMG, LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). Each inhibitor concentration was tested in 2 to 4
replicate wells and each experimental plate included 12 replicate nontreated control wells.
Absorbance values of treated wells were related to the mean absorbance of the nontreated wells to
estimate % cell viability. Datapoints are given as means of 2 to 4 replicates with SEM. Sigmoidal
dose response curves were fitted and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values were calculated
using GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 with a bottom constraint of 0 applying the formula Y=
Top/(1+10(Log10EC50-X)*HillSlope).
Longer-term SARS-CoV2 infected and PI treated VeroE6 cell cultures. VeroE6 cells were
seeded at 106 cells per flask in T25 flasks (Nunc) and the following day infected at MOI 0.000016
with SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020. Cells were treated with specified fold EC50
of inhibitors on the day of infection, by adding inhibitors together with the virus and again on day 1
post infection. Following, cells were split and treated every 2 days with the specified concentrations
of inhibitors and the percentage of infected culture cells was evaluated by immunostaining for the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and immunofluorescence imaging, as described below. For each
experiment a nontreated infected culture was included serving as a positive control for infection.
Cultures were closed when massive cell death occurred, induced by viral infection and/or inhibitor
treatment.

Immunostaining and immunofluorescence imaging for evaluation of longer-term VeroE6 cell
cultures. In longer-term SARS-CoV-2 infected and PI treated cultures, following cell splitting and
treatment, replicate cell cultures were seeded in 8-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rochester, NY, USA). The next day, cells were fixed, and virus was inactivated by submersion into
methanol for 20 minutes. Chamber slides were washed twice with PBS-tween and then incubated
with primary antibody SARS-CoV-2 spike chimeric monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological #40150D004, Beijing, China) diluted 1:1,000 in PBSK for 2 hours at room temperature. Following 2
washes with PBS-tween, chamber slides were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa-Fluor 488
goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen #A-11013, Paisley, UK) diluted 1:500 and Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS-tween for 20 minutes at room temperature. The
percentage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein positive cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy
(ZEISS Axio Vert.A1, Jena, Germany), assigning the following designations: 0% infected cells (no
cells infected), single infected cells, and 10%–90% infected cells (in steps of 10%). The images
were acquired with ZEN 3.0 software.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Potency of a panel of HCV PI and an HCV NS4A inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 in
VeroE6 cells. VeroE6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and the following day infected with
SARS-CoV-2 followed by treatment with specified concentrations of the PI boceprevir, telaprevir,
narlaprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir,
deldeprevir, asunaprevir and faldaprevir, as well as HCV NS4A inhibitor ACH-806, as described in
Materials and Methods. After 46-50 hours of incubation, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were
visualized by immunostaining for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and quantified by automated
counting, as described in Materials and Methods. Datapoints (red dots) are means of counts from 7
replicate cultures ± standard errors of the means (SEM) and represent % residual infectivity,
determined as % SARS-CoV-2 positive cells relative to means of counts from 14 replicate infected
nontreated control cultures. Sigmoidal concentration response curves (red lines) were fitted and
EC50 values were determined, as described in Materials and Methods. Cell viability data were
obtained in replicate assays with noninfected cells using a colorimetric assay, as described in
Materials and Methods. Datapoints (blue triangles) are means of 3 replicate cultures ± SEM and
represent % cell viability relative to mean absorbance from 12 replicate nontreated control cultures.
Sigmoidal concentration response curves were fitted and CC50 values were determined as shown in
Supplementary Figure 3. The red / blue stippled line represents the drug concentrations at which
DMSO is expected to induce antiviral effects with reduction of residual infectivity to <70% /
cytotoxicity with reduction of cell viability to <90%, according to Supplementary Figure 2.

and CC50 values were determined, as shown in Supplementary Figure 4. The blue stippled line
represents the drug concentrations at which DMSO is expected to induce cytotoxicity with
reduction of cell viability to <90%, according to Supplementary Figure 2; DMSO did not induce
antiviral effects in the tested dose ranges (Supplementary Figure 2).
Figure 3. Analysis of interactions of selected HCV PI with remdesivir. VeroE6 cells seeded in
96-well plates were infected the following day with SARS-CoV-2 followed by treatment with
specified concentrations of the linear PI boceprevir (BOC) and narlaprevir (NAR), or the
macrocyclic PI simeprevir (SIM), paritaprevir (PAR) and grazoprevir (GRA), or polymerase
inhibitor remdesivir (REM), or a combination of these PI and remdesivir, as described in Materials
and Methods. After 46-50 hours incubation SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were visualized by
immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and quantified by automated counting, as
described in Materials and Methods. Fractional effect (Fa) values were calculated by relating counts
from infected and treated cultures to the mean count from at least 21 infected nontreated cultures
and were entered into CompuSyn software. Datapoints are means of 6 to 7 replicates, and for each
treatment experiment 6 to 10 datapoints were entered. For each inhibitor combination depicted per
row, the following curves were fitted using Compusyn: (A) concentration-Fa curves plotting Fa
values ranging from 0.01 to 0.99 against specified inhibitor concentrations. (B) Fa-CI curves
plotting CI values ranging from 0 to 2 against Fa values ranging from 0.01 to 0.99. (C) Fa-Log10CI
curves plotting logarithmic CI values ranging from 0.01 to 100 against Fa values ranging from 0.01
to 0.99. (B and C) Overall, CI values ≥1.1 suggest antagonism “A”, while CI values <0.9 suggest
synergism “S” indicated by green and red colour coding of the y-axis, respectively. (D) Fa-DRI
curves plotting DRI values ranging from 0 to 5 against Fa values ranging from 0.01 to 0.99; the
datapoints and curve for simeprevir are outside the graph area and can be seen in (E). (E) FaLog10DRI curves plotting logarithmic DRI values ranging from 0.01 to 100 against Fa values
ranging from 0.01 to 0.99. For an overview of CI and DRI values see Figure 4.

antagonistic manner. Data are based on experiments shown in Figure 3. For the specified inhibitor
combinations, boceprevir + remdesivir (BOC + REM), narlaprevir + remdesivir (NAR + REM),
simeprevir + remdesivir (SIM + REM), paritaprevir + remdesivir (PAR + REM), and grazoprevir +

Figure 5. Comparison of barrier to escape for HCV PI at equipotent concentrations. VeroE6
cells seeded the previous day in T25 flasks were infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by treatment
with 1-fold EC50 of PI boceprevir, telaprevir, narlaprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir,
vaniprevir, danoprevir, asunaprevir and faldaprevir, which were administered immediately after
infection and on day 1, 3, 5 and 7 post infection when cells were split, as described in Materials and
Methods. Left panel, the % of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells on the specified days post infection, was
determined by immunostaining. Right panel, replicate cultures were derived following cell splitting
and treatment and immunostained for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and counterstained with
Hoechst dye and images were acquired, as descried in Materials and Methods. Cultures summarized
in this figure are derived from different experimental setups, each including an infected nontreated
control culture, which showed viral spread comparable to that in the depicted representative culture.
*Culture was terminated, or infection data not recorded, due to virus induced cell death. **Culture
was terminated due to drug induced cytotoxicity, possibly enhanced by viral infection.

Materials and Methods. Left panel, the % of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells on the specified days post
infection was determined by immunostaining. Right panel, replicate cultures were derived
following cell splitting and treatment and immunostained for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and
counterstained with Hoechst dye and images were acquired, as described in Materials and Methods.
*Culture was terminated, or infection data not recorded, due to virus induced cell death. #Culture
was maintained for a total of 15 days without indication of infection (no observation of single
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein positive cells).

EC50, 50% effective concentration (µM), determined in antiviral treatment assays as described in

Materials and Methods. For voxilaprevir and deldeprevir, in VeroE6 cells, >50% residual infectivity
was observed at the highest noncytotoxic concentrations; for glecaprevir, the highest applied
concentration was limited due to antiviral effects of the diluent DMSO; thus, for these PI no precise
EC50 value could be determined. EC50 values are also included in Figures 1 and 2.
b

CC50, 50% cytotoxic concentration (µM), determined in cell viability assays as described in

Materials and Methods. For boceprevir, telaprevir, glecaprevir, danoprevir and ACH-806, in
VeroE6 cells, >50% cell viability was observed at the highest concentrations at dilutions where
DMSO was not expected to reduce cell viability to <90% (Supplementary Figure 2); thus, no
precise CC50 values could be determined.
c

SI, selectivity index, determined as CC50/EC50 based on results from antiviral treatment assays

and cell viability assays. na, not applicable.
