SUMMARY

The development of effective countermeasures against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a priority. We
designed and produced ConVac, a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine
vector that expresses the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used golden Syrian hamsters
as animal model of severe COVID-19 to test the efficacy of the ConVac vaccine. A single vaccine dose
elicited high levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific binding and neutralizing antibodies; following intranasal
challenge with SARS-CoV-2, animals were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs.
No enhanced pathology was observed in vaccinated animals upon challenge, but some inflammation
was still detected. The data indicate rapid control of SARS-CoV-2 replication by the S1-based VSVvectored SARS-CoV-2 ConVac vaccine.

INTRODUCTION

The current pandemic of coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 36.4 million confirmed cases of
human infections worldwide, including over two million confirmed deaths (as of January 17, 2021)
(WHO, 2021). There are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Multiple
vaccines are being developed, including inactivated virus, viral vector-based vaccines, protein subunits
and mRNA vaccines (reviewed by Krammer (Krammer, 2020)). The main antigen of these vaccines is
the full-length spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, since the virus uses its S protein to mediate cell entry.
Non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which
replicates systemically, represent highly potent vaccine platforms (Bukreyev et al., 2006). These
vaccine platforms are capable of stably expressing foreign open reading frames flanked with
transcriptional gene-start and gene-end signals specific for the viral vector’s polymerase. A number of
vaccine candidates for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV,
SARS-CoV-2 and porcine coronavirus utilized VSV and rabies virus as vector backbones to express
the spike protein as immunogen (Faber et al., 2005; Kapadia et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2019; Ke et al.,
2019; Wirblich et al., 2017). We previously developed a MERS vaccine candidate in which the S1
domain of the MERS spike protein was fused to the C-terminal part of the rabies virus glycoprotein to
allow incorporation and display on the surface of virions (Wirblich et al., 2017). We reasoned that
removal of the S2 domain should steer the immune response towards the receptor-binding domain
which is located in the S1 domain and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. To expedite COVID-19
vaccine development, we took this proven strategy to generate a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate in
which the S2 domain was replaced with the C-terminal part of the VSV glycoprotein as a membrane
anchor and expressed in a replication-competent VSV vector.
We assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of our vaccine in the recently established golden

Syrian hamster model of COVID-19 (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020). Golden
Syrian hamsters are susceptible to intranasal infection with wild type SARS-CoV-2 without the need for
virus adaptation, and develop severe clinical manifestations similar to those observed in human
COVID-19 patients with a severe disease (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020).

RESULTS

Design and development of the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ConVac
To design our ConVac vaccine construct, we decided to use only the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike
S for several reasons. First, the S1 region contains the necessary neutralizing epitopes with the
receptor-binding domain being most important (Ho, 2020). Second, both prefusion and postfusion S2
structures present potential drawbacks as vaccine constructs, and vaccines expressing the full length S
spike protein may generate both prefusion and postfusion spikes as observed in in vitro mammalian cell
culture production systems (Cai et al., 2020). Because of its high level of glycosylation it has been
proposed that the S2 postfusion configuration may act as an immunological decoy by eliciting
immunodominant non-neutralizing responses while stabilization of prefusion S2 may affect bonds
between protomers thus affecting the overall trimer stability (Cai et al., 2020). The third reason for the
use of the S1 only approach is that the S2 domain is more conserved between different coronaviruses
(Huang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020), and we hypothesized that in previously coronavirus-infected
humans the immune response might predominantly target S2 rather than S1. Lastly, previous research
with a rabies virus-vectored vaccine indicated that the expression of the full-length coronavirus S
protein interfered with the transport of the rabies virus G protein and reduced vaccine viral titers
dramatically (Wirblich et al., 2017). Moreover, VSV G-deleted viruses grow to a lower titer of about 107
PFU, whereas VSV G-containing viruses can reach titers up to 1-5×108, making vaccine production
more efficient (Kretzschmar et al., 1997; Schnell et al., 1996). These reasons led us to develop a VSVbased vaccine construct containing only the membrane-anchored S1 domain by substituting the S2
domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the C-terminal region of the VSV glycoprotein.
Thus, following the strategy we previously employed to generate a membrane-anchored S1
domain of MERS (Wirblich et al., 2017) we replaced the S2 domain of SARS-CoV-2 (aa 682-1284) with
the C-terminal 70 amino acids of VSV G (Fig. 1A). This portion contains the complete cytoplasmic tail of
the VSV glycoprotein, as well as the transmembrane domain and a short membrane-proximal portion of

the ectodomain of VSV-G. The VSV-G tail serves as a membrane anchor for S1 and allows
incorporation into VSV particles. We recovered the virus as described previously (Kurup et al., 2015)
and performed immunofluorescence staining with antibodies directed against S1 or VSV glycoprotein
(Fig. 1B). Vero cells infected with ConVac expressed both S1 and VSV glycoprotein. No S1 signal was
detected in cells infected with a control virus expressing Hendra virus G. We also performed western
blotting to assess protein expression (Fig. 1C). Using polyclonal antiserum directed against the S1
domain we detected a protein of 160 kDa and a shorter band of approximately 100 kDa. The smaller
band presumably represents unglycosylated or partially glycosylated protein, whereas the larger band
represents the fully glycosylated mature protein. VSV glycoprotein expression was noticeably reduced
compared to the control virus expressing GFP. To assess the impact on viral replication, we evaluated
growth kinetics in Vero cells (Fig. 1D). ConVac grew to titers 2-4x108 FFU/ml, which are about 5-fold
lower than the control virus expressing GFP and modestly lower compared to a recombinant VSV
expressing Hendra virus G. Similar titers were obtained in human lung and baby hamster kidney cells
(data not shown).

Development of the hamster model of COVID-19
To determine if golden Syrian hamsters are a suitable animal model to study the protective efficacy of
the vaccine, eight female golden Syrian hamsters were infected intranasally with 105 PFU of SARSCoV-2 strain USA_WA1/202 (Harcourt et al., 2020) at day 0 in a volume of 100 µl, and four female
hamsters were mock-infected with 100 µl of phosphate buffered saline. Animals were monitored daily
for weight loss (Fig. 2A). Viral load determination in the lungs (Fig. 2B) and nasal turbinates (Fig. 2C)
was performed 2 and 4 days post challenge. At day 4, SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters had lost an
average of 7.3% of their initial body weight, while mock-infected animals did not display any weight loss
(Fig.2A). Viral loads were both higher in the lungs (mean viral load of 3.0 x 106 PFU/g) and in the nasal
turbinates (2.7 x 106 PFU/g) at day 2 compared to day 4 (3.4 x 105 PFU/g of lung and 4.1 x 104 PFU/g

nasal turbinate) (Fig. 2B,C). Lung histopathological changes were assessed in two animals of each
group at each time point (criteria displayed in Supplemental Table 1 (Matute-Bello et al., 2011)). The
SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters displayed lung pathology consistent with typical interstitial pneumonia
at both time points (Fig. 2D) while some alveolar changes and septal thickening (Fig. 2I) were also
observed in the mock-infected animals that were a consequence of the CO2 euthanasia method used in
this pilot study. In SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, widespread inflammatory changes consisting of
small to large inflammatory foci were observed (Fig. 2E,F). In addition, infiltration of airways with
inflammatory cells (Fig. 2G,J) and a moderate level of inter-alveolar septal thickening were noted in
SARS-CoV-2 infected animals (Fig. 2H,J). Thus, lung pathology observed in our pilot study indicates
that the golden Syrian hamster is a suitable animal model reproducing the typical interstitial pneumonia
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans. In addition, our findings are in agreement with others as while this
manuscript was in preparation, other teams reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters causes a
severe lung disease, with viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract (Chan et al., 2020;
Imai et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020).

ConVac vaccine induces a robust antibody response in hamsters
The immunogenicity and efficacy of the ConVac vaccine was evaluated in the golden Syrian hamster
animal model. Hamsters at 12 animals per group were vaccinated once intramuscularly on day 0 (Fig.
3A) with 2x107 FFU/animal of ConVac, while the control group remained naive. On day 10 post
vaccination, one vaccinated hamster was euthanized due to hind leg paralysis, and on day 11 another
hamster was found dead after being lethargic, scruffy, hunched and with heavy breathing the day
before. All other animals demonstrated no disease symptoms. At day 31, vaccinated and control
hamsters were challenged intranasally with a dose of 105 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate
USA_WA1/202 (Harcourt et al., 2020). Serum samples were assayed longitudinally to determine
SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific binding antibody responses (Fig. 3). Testing of the binding to purified S1
protein demonstrated induction of IgG EC50 titers ranging from 505 to 5,096 with a mean titer of 2,279

(Fig. 3B) after vaccination. One control animal demonstrated presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by
ELISA but was negative for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. The S1-specific Th1 isotype response
IgG2/3 titers were also determined (Fig. 3C); the ConVac vaccine elicited titers ranging from 39 to 285
with a mean titer of 139, mirroring the total IgG responses albeit at a lower level. The SARS-CoV-2
challenge did not elicit an anamnestic binding antibody response in the ConVac-vaccinated animals, as
the binding antibody titers did not increase between the time points before and after the challenge (day
28 vs day 34 and day 28 vs day 46, P>0.05 for both IgG and IgG2/3, Wilcoxon test). Neutralization of
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3D) was assessed with the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing Neon Green
protein (SARS-CoV-2-mNG) using the fluorescent signal as a readout for viral replication thus enabling
a fast and quantitative evaluation (Xie et al., 2020). The ConVac vaccine elicited 50% SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing titers ranging from 1:85 to 1:886 with a mean titer of 1:369 (Fig. 3E). Taken together, our
data show that a single vaccine dose induced a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response.

ConVac vaccine significantly decreases SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the lungs
After the challenge, the hamsters were monitored for 15 days. Animals were checked daily for body
weight and clinical signs of disease. In the control group, a significant loss of weight compared to the
vaccine group (P=0.0002) was detected, and at the peak of weight loss, which occurred at day 5, the
average weight loss was 9.1%, (Fig. 4A). None of the control or the vaccinated animals reached
moribund state, but several control animals had higher disease scores due to a weight loss greater than
10% of their initial body weight (Fig. 4B).
On days three and fifteen post challenge, half of the hamsters in each study group were
euthanized, and lungs and nasal turbinates were harvested to determine viral loads by plaque reduction
assay (Fig. 5A,B) and number of viral copies by RT-qPCR assay (Fig. 5C,D). In the control group three
days post infection, high virus load was detected the lungs of all animals (Fig. 5A), ranging from
6.5x105 PFU/g to 2.5x106 PFU/g, and in the nasal turbinates of all but one animal ranging from 4.0x102
PFU/g to 1.2x104 PFU/g (Fig. 5B). In contrast, no virus was detected in the lungs of 4 out of 5

vaccinated hamsters, while the remaining one had the viral titer 645-fold less than in the control group.
No virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of two vaccinated animals, while the three remaining
animals displayed titers reduced by 57 fold compared to the control animals. On day 15, no SARSCoV-2 was detected in lungs and nasal turbinates of both the control and the vaccinated hamsters (Fig.
5A,B).
RNA isolated from the lungs and nasal turbinate homogenates were assessed for the presence
of viral RNA copies by RT-qPCR assay (Fig. 5C,D). In the control group, high virus RNA copies were
detected in the lungs and nasal turbinates of animals with ~1x1011 RNA copies/g on day 3 post
challenge, ~1x107 RNA copies/g in the lung and ~6x107 RNA copies/g in the nasal turbinates on day
15 post challenge. In contrast, significantly lower viral RNA copies were detected in the ConVac
vaccinated animals with ~7x107 RNA copies/g in the lungs and ~1x1010 RNA copies/g in the nasal
turbinates on day 3 post challenge; ~3.6x106 RNA copies/g in the lungs and ~5x106 RNA copies/g in
the nasal turbinates on day 15 post challenge. We assume that a portion of the detected viral RNA on
day 3 is residual input challenge virus as it was below the detection limit of the plaque assay. In
addition, the detected viral RNA on day 15 post challenge is not derived from viable viral particles since
no plaques were detected.

Vaccinated animals do not demonstrate enhanced lung pathology upon challenge, but still
show some inflammation in the lungs
Pathology scores were determined in a blinded manner in lung sections of control and vaccinated
animals on days 3 and 15 post challenge (Fig. 6,7). Regardless of the timepoint or the animal group,
interstitial pneumonic changes were noted in all animals (Fig. 6, representative pathology pictures; and
Fig. 7A,F, mean overall pathology scores). On day 3, the control group (Fig. 6A,B) showed widespread
consolidation, inflammatory infiltration and obstruction of airways by inflammatory cells, while the
ConVac vaccine group (Fig. 6C,D) demonstrated only moderate inflammatory changes with
mononuclear cellular infiltration, septal thickening, and mild airway pathology. On day 15 (Fig. 6E,F),

the control unvaccinated group displayed typical interstitial pneumonic changes consisting of small to
large inflammatory foci, septal thickening and airway occlusion, with fewer inflammatory cells, while the
ConVac vaccine group (Fig. 6G,H) displayed moderate interstitial pneumonia with septal thickening and
reduced mononuclear cellular infiltrates in airways, but some hyperplasia was still present. These
findings were confirmed by determining individual histopathology scores, which identified small to large
inflammatory foci of moderate intensity involving large areas of lung sections on both days 3 and 15
(Fig. 7B-E,7G-J). Most animals had infiltration of large and small airways with inflammatory cells;
cellular infiltrates consisted of mononuclear cells, including macrophages and lymphocytes. A moderate
level of inter-alveolar septal thickening was a consistent feature in both groups (Fig. 7E,J). Perivascular
cuffing was common and present in most sections. A semi-quantitative comparison of the control and
vaccinated animals demonstrated no enhanced pathology in the vaccinated group (P>0.05 for all
panels, Mann-Whitney test).

DISCUSSION

The VSV vaccine platform has several features that make it a strong candidate for further
development. These include the ability to stably express an inserted foreign open reading frame, the
robust replication resulting in a high immunogenicity and the lack of preexisting immunity in the human
population. VSV-vectored vaccine candidates have been developed against several human pathogens
(Fathi et al., 2019) including Ebola virus; in 2019, the VSV-vectored vaccine Ervebo was approved by the
European Medicines Agency and the FDA. Here we designed and developed a VSV-based SARS-CoV2 vaccine ConVac and tested it for immunogenicity and efficacy in the hamster model of COVID-19.
The ConVac vaccine elicited a robust humoral response and protected hamsters from SARSCoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. A single dose of ConVac elicited strong SARS-CoV-2
S1 binding and virus neutralizing antibody titers. We note that two vaccinated animals were euthanized
on days 10 and 11 due to a disease of unknown ethiology; however, we cannot completely exclude a
residual neurovirulence of the vaccine construct at the high, 2 x 107 FFU, vaccine dose used in our
study. Viral loads determined by plaque assay in lung tissues were significantly reduced in ConVacvaccinated animals compared to controls, with only one vaccinated hamster having detectable viral
loads on day 3, suggesting that the ConVac vaccine prevents or strongly reduces SARS-CoV-2
replication in the lower respiratory tract. The hamster with the detectable viral load on day 3 had the
lowest neutralizing antibody titer. Viral loads in the nasal turbinate tissues of vaccinated hamsters were
reduced compared to control animals, but the difference was not statistically significant due to the
limited number of animals per group and high variability between samples. Viral RNA levels determined
by RT-qPCR confirmed these findings of a more robust protection in the lung compared to the nasal
turbinates. These data suggest that ConVac elicited an immune response to effectively control the viral
load.
Two recent studies used G gene-deleted VSV vaccine constructs expressing full-length SARS-

CoV-2 S protein in mice and hamsters (Case et al., 2020; Yahalom-Ronen et al., 2020). In contrast to
these two other studies, we used only the S1 subunit of the protein because it contains the necessary
neutralizing epitopes with that in the receptor-binding domain being highly protective (Ho, 2020) and
both prefusion and postfusion S2 conformations present potential drawbacks as vaccine constructs
(Cai et al., 2020). Furthermore, unlike the S1 protein, the S2 subunit is more conserved between
coronaviruses possibly leading to predominant S2-specific responses in humans previously infected
with heterologous coronaviruses. The 50% mean neutralizing titer induced by our vaccine, 1:369, was
higher than the titer of 1:173 elicited by the other VSV vaccine candidate assessed in hamsters by
Yahalom-Ronen et al. (Yahalom-Ronen et al., 2020). When tested in mice, one of these vaccines
elicited mean and median neutralizing titers greater than 1:5,000 after two vaccine doses but the
median neutralization titer after one vaccine dose was only 1:59 (Case et al., 2020). The difference in
the immunogenicity can also be explained by differences in growth kinetics and tissue tropism between
a G-deleted VSV and a G-containing virus with the latter growing faster, having a broader tropism in
vivo and targeting additional types of immune cells. Side-by-side comparisons would be needed to
elucidate this further.
We used the hamster model of COVID-19, which does not require SARS-CoV-2 adaptation,
exhibits high viral titers and severe pathologic changes in the lungs (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020;
Sia et al., 2020) and therefore seems to reproduce a severe form of COVID-19 observed in humans.
Indeed, we confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 intranasal infection of hamsters results in viral replication in the
upper and lower respiratory tract. In addition, lung histopathological damage was consistent with the
changes described by others as this manuscript was in preparation (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020;
Sia et al., 2020). Therefore the golden Syrian hamster represents an excellent model of a severe
COVID-19 suitable for vaccine testing.
Besides hamsters, several animal models have been developed for COVID-19. These include
the mouse model with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (Dinnon et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020),

transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)(Bao et al., 2020); mice
infected with a replication-defective Ad5 adenovirus expressing ACE-2 (Ad5-hACE2) transiently
(Hassan et al., 2020) and the NHP model of COVID-19 (Munster et al., 2020). The mouse-adapted
strains of SARS-CoV-2, despite reaching the titers of 106 PFU/g or 108.3 viral RNA copies per gram of
lung tissue, caused only mild to moderate lung disease (Dinnon et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020). In the
Ad5-hACE2 transduced mice, SARS-CoV-2 replicated in the lungs reaching 106 PFU/g and caused a
lung pathology consistent with a severe pneumonia (Hassan et al., 2020). Transgenic mice expressing
human ACE2 supported SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs (106.8 copies/ml) and developed
moderate interstitial pneumonia (Bao et al., 2020). In Rhesus macaques, SARS-CoV-2 replicated in the
lungs reaching 105-108 copies/g but induced only mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia (Munster et
al., 2020). Thus the levels of pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the available animal models vary
significantly from very mild to severe with the hamster representing a model of a severe disease,
potentially explaining some residual lung pathology observed in the ConVac-vaccinated hamsters.
Indeed, we propose that despite the lack of detectable viable SARS-CoV-2 by plaque assay, the
observed pathologic changes in ConVac-vaccinated hamsters are likely to be related to the extremely
high susceptibility of hamsters to SARS-CoV-2 on one hand and the very robust immune response to
the vaccine on the other hand. Upon intranasal challenge, binding to cells of the epithelium of the
respiratory tract and possibly some very limited replication, the virus is likely to be neutralized by the
high levels of antibodies, resulting in the influx of Fc-bearing immune cells including lymphocytes and
macrophages. Importantly, while some pathologic changes were observed in vaccinated animals, no
enhancement compared to the control group was detected. Furthermore, testing of a vaccine in
different animal models (mouse, hamster, ferret, NHP) with various levels of susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 is likely to result in a more realistic prediction of the outcome of vaccination and subsequent
infection in humans.
In conclusion, our data show that the VSV-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based only on the S1
subunit induces a high titer of serum neutralizing antibodies and protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Antibodies. Monoclonal antibody CR3022 was produced by transient transfection of 293F cells with
cDNA expression plasmids obtained from BEI resources. The cells were transfected at a density of
approximately 2x106 cells/ml with equal amounts of each plasmid using Expifectamine reagent (Thermo
Fisher) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Supernatant was harvested after 45 days and antibody purified on Protein G Sepharose (Abcam, GE Healthcare) following standard
protocols. Monoclonal antibodies I1 and I14 against the VSV glycoprotein and monoclonal antibody
23H12 against the VSV matrix protein were purified from hybridoma supernatant by affinity
chromatography on Protein G sepharose. The antibodies were labeled with fluorophores using Dylight
antibody labeling kits from Thermo Fisher. The following SARS-CoV-2 specific human monoclonal
antibodies were kindly provided by Distributed Bio: DB_A03-09, 12; DB_B01-04, B07-10, 12; DB_C0105, 07, 09, 10; DB_D01, 02; DB_E01-04, 06, 07; DB_F02-03.

Generation of ConVac vaccine. Codon-optimized cDNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain fused
to the C-terminal portion of the VSV glycoprotein was obtained from Genscript. The cDNA was cloned
into the XhoI and NheI sites of a modified recombinant VSV vector containing an additional
transcription start stop signal between the G and L genes (Wirblich et al., 2017). The recombinant virus
was recovered on 293T cells as described previously, filtered through an 0.22 µm filter and used to
inoculate Vero (CCL-81, ATCC) or human BEAS-2B lung cells (gift from R. Plemper, University of
Georgia). The infected cells were cultured in serum-free VP-SFM or Optipro medium. Cell culture
supernatant was harvested three days post inoculation, filtered through 0.45 um PES membrane filters
and used for virus characterization and animal experiments.

Characterization of the ConVac vaccine. Baby hamster kidney (BSR) cells were inoculated with
ConVac or VSV control virus expressing GFP at an MOI of 0.2 PFU. The following day cells were lysed

in detergent buffer (1% TritonX-100, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 20mM HEPES pH 7.0,
1 mM EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher). Protein concentration
was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher), and ten micrograms of total protein were resolved on
4-20% Tris-Glycine gels (Thermo Fisher). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane
and probed with polyclonal rabbit serum against SARS-CoV S1 domain (Thermofisher, Cat No. PA581798 and PA5-81795), monoclonal antibodies I1 (8G5F11) and I14 (IE9F) against the VSV
glycoprotein and monoclonal antibody 23H12 against VSV matrix protein provided by Douglas Lyles
(Wake Forest University). After incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson
Immunoresearch), the membrane was incubated with WestDura substrate (Thermo Fisher), and bands
were visualized on a Fluochem M imager (Biotechne).
For immunofluorescence staining, Vero E6 cells were seeded on coverslips and infected at
three different MOI ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 PFU. After 10 hours, the cells were fixed for 10 min in
Cytofix/Cytoperm (Becton Dickinson) and permeabilized for 10 minutes in 0.5% Tween 20 in Dulbecco
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). After washing with DPBS the cells were incubated for 2 hours with
monoclonal antibody CR3022 conjugated to Dylight 550 or a mixture of monoclonal antibodies I1 and
I14 conjugated to Dylight 488. Coverslips were washed in DPBS and mounted using Prolong Glass
(Thermo Fisher). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioskop40 microscope equipped with a ProgresCF
digital camera.
To assess viral replication of ConVac in vitro, Vero (CCL-81) cells were seeded in 6-well plates
and infected next day at 34°C at an MOI of 5 and 0.05 PFU. After 1.5 hours the inoculum was removed
the cells were washed 3x in DMEM and fresh medium containing 2% FCS was added to each well.
Supernatant was collected at various time points from 6 to 36 hours post infection. A ten-fold serial
dilution of supernatant was prepared in DMEM medium in a 96-well plate. Diluted supernatant was
added to Vero E6 cells seeded in 96-well plates the day before. After 24 hours incubation at 34°C, the
cells were fixed with 80% acetone and stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody 23H12
against the VSV matrix protein.

Viruses. The SARS-CoV-2 strain used in this study is the first U.S. isolate SARS-CoV-2
USA_WA1/2020 from the Washington Sate patient identified on January 22, 2020 (Harcourt et al.,
2020). Passage 3 was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and
Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at UTMB. Virus stocks were propagated in Vero E6 cells. The challenge stock
used in this study is passage 5. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing Neon Green protein (SARSCoV-2-mNG) (Xie et al., 2020) used in the neutralization assay was developed by Dr. Pei-Yong Shi at
UTMB. Virus stocks were propagated in Vero E6 cells and a passage 4 was used in this study.

Animal studies. The studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations described
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. UTMB is an
AAALAC-accredited institution and all animal work was approved by the IACUC Committee of UTMB.
All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and all procedures involving potential pain were
performed with the appropriate anesthetic or analgesic. The number of hamsters used was scientifically
justified based on statistical analyses of virological and immunological outcomes.

Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters. On day 0, seven week-old golden Syrian female
hamsters (Envigo) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and 8 animals were exposed intransally
to the targeted dose of 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in a volume of 100 µl, while 4 animals were mockinfected with 100 µl 1X DPBS. Animals were monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease. Half
of the animals in each group (4 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 2 mock-infected hamsters) were euthanized
by CO2 inhalation for viral load determination 2 and 4 days post challenge.

Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Seven week-old golden Syrian female hamsters (Envigo)
were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane prior to immunization and blood collections and with
ketamine/xylazine prior to the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. On day 0, the vaccine group (N=12 animals)

was inoculated with 2x107 FFU of ConVac in 100 µl injection volume via the intramuscular route (50 µl
per hind leg), while the control group (N=12 animals) remained naive. Vena cava blood collections were
performed one day prior to the immunization and on day 28 afterwards. On day 31, vaccinated and
control animals were exposed intransally to the targeted dose of 105 PFU of isolate SARS-CoV-2.
Animals were monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease. Half of the animals in each group (5
vaccinated and 6 control hamsters) were euthanized by overdose of injectable anesthetics 3 days post
challenge for viral load determination. Remaining animals were euthanized 15 days post infection by
overdose of ketamine/xylazine.

Binding antibody response. To determine antibody responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, an
indirect ELISA was developed utilizing purified S1 protein. The soluble S1 protein was produced by
transfecting 293T cells with a plasmid that expresses a secreted S1 ectodomain (aa 16-681) fused to
the C-terminal HA tag. Purification of the HA-tagged protein from the supernatant of transfected cells
was carried out as described previously (Kurup et al., 2015). Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (S1) were measured by an indirect ELISA as described previously(Kurup et al., 2015). Briefly,
wells were coated overnight at 4°C with 500 ng/mL of S1 recombinant protein. The secondary
antibodies used in the ELISA are HRP-conjugated goat anti-syrian hamster IgG secondary antibody
(Jackson immunoresearch, Cat# 107-035-142, 1:8000 in PBST) or mouse anti-hamster-IgG2/3-HRP
(Southern Biotech, Cat# 1935-05, 1:8000 in PBST). Optical density was measured at 490 nm and 630
nm using an ELX800 plate reader (Biotek Instruments). Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism
(Version 8.4.3) using 4-parameter nonlinear regression.

Neutralizing antibody response. Sera collected from animals were tested for neutralizing capabilities
against SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, serum samples were heat-inacitvated (30 minutes at 56°C). 10-fold
diluted sera were further diluted in a 2-fold serial fashion, and 60 µl of each serum dilution was mixed
with 60 µl of SARS-CoV-2-mNG (200 PFU) (Xie et al., 2020). The serum/virus mixtures were incubated

for 1 hr at 37°C. 100 µl of the serum/virus mixtures were then transferred to Vero E6 cell monolayers in
flat-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 2 days at 37°C. Virus fluorescence was measured with a
Cytation Hybrid Multi-Mode reader at 488 nm (Biotek Instruments).

Tissue processing and viral load determination. For the pathogenicity study, animals from each
study group were euthanized on days 2 and 4 post challenge, and the lungs and nasal turbinates were
harvested. For the vaccine study, animals were euthanized on days 3 and 15 post challenge, and the
lungs and nasal turbinates were harvested. For both studies, right lungs and nasal turbinates were
placed in L15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic
solution (Gibco), flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at -80ºC until processing. Tissues were thawed and
homogenized using the TissueLyser II system (Qiagen). Tissue homogenates were titrated on Vero E6
cell monolayers in 24-well plates to determine viral loads. Plates were incubated 3 days at 37°C before
being fixed with 10% formalin and removed from containment. Plaques were visualized by
immunostaining with 1 µg/mL cocktail of 37 SARS-CoV-2 specific human antibodies kindly provided by
Distributed Bio. As the secondary antibody, HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (SeraCare) was used at
dilution 1:500. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1X DPBS with 5% milk. Plaques were
revealed by AEC substrate (enQuire Bioreagents).

qRT-PCR. Tissue homogenates were mixed with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) at a 1:5 volume
ratio of homogenate to TRIzol. The RNA extraction protocol for biological fluids using TRIzol Reagent
was followed until the phase separation step. The remaining RNA extraction was done using the
PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion). The quantity and quality (260/280 ratios) of RNA extracted was
measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein cDNA was generated from
RNA from Bei Resources (NR-52285) by One-Step RT PCR (SuperScript IV, Thermo Fisher) with
primers SARS COV-2 N IVT F1 (5’GAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGATGTCTGATAATGGACCC-3’) and SARS COV-2 N IVT R1

(5’- GCTAGCTTAGGCCTGAGTTGAGTCAGCACTGCT-3’). The SARS-CoV-2 N standards were
generated by in-vitro transcription of the generated SARS-CoV-2 N cDNA using the MegaScript T7
Transcription kit (Invitrogen), followed by using the MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit. Aliquots of 2
×1010 copies/µL were frozen at -80°C. Five microliters of RNA per sample were run in triplicate, using
the primers 2019-nCoV_N2-F (5’- TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA-3’), 2019-nCoV_N2-R (5’-GCGCG
ACATTCCGAAGAA-3’) and probe 2019-nCoV_N2-P-FAM (5’-ACAATTTGCCCCCAGCGCTTCAG-3’).

Histopathology. Following euthanasia, necropsy was performed, gross lesions were noted, and left
lungs were harvested in 10% formalin for histopathological assessment. After a 24-hour incubation at
4ºC, lungs were transferred to fresh 10% formalin for an additional 48-hour incubation before removal
from containment. Tissues were processed by standard histological procedures by the UTMB Anatomic
Pathology Core, and 4 μm-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections of
lungs were examined for the extent of inflammation, type of inflammatory foci, and changes in
alveoli/alveolar septa/airways/blood vessels in parallel with sections from uninfected or unvaccinated
lungs. The blinded tissue sections were semi-quantitatively scored for pathological lesions using the
criteria described in Supplemental Table 1. Examination was performed with an Olympus CX43
microscope at magnification 40X for general observation and 100X magnification for detailed
observation. Each section was scored independently by two trained lab members and as scores were
in agreement, only one set is presented.

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 6.07). P<0.05 was
considered significant.

Biocontainment work. Work with SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities of the
Galveston National Laboratory according to approved standard operating protocols.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Generation and characterization of ConVac. (A) Left: genome structure of the VSV vector
expressing the membrane anchored SARS-CoV2 S1 domain. The S1 domain of SARS-CoV2 spike
protein (aa 1-681) was joined to the C-terminal 70 amino acids of the VSV glycoprotein. The fusion
construct was inserted between the glycoprotein and polymerase genes of VSV. The S1 domain is
shown in red and the VSV G tail in green. The transmembrane domain of the VSV glycoprotein is
indicated by a yellow box. The amino acids at the junction between S1 and VSV glycoprotein are
highlighted. Right: schematic representation of the vaccine construct which shows the two
transmembrane proteins anchored in the membrane. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of Vero E6 cells
infected with ConVac and a control virus expressing Hendra virus G (VSV-HeVG). The cells were fixed
and permeabilized 10 hours after infection and stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody
CR3022 against the S1 domain (shown in red) and two monoclonal antibodies against the VSV
glycoprotein (shown in green). (C) Western blot analysis of BSR cells infected with Convac and a
control VSV virus expressing GFP. Protein lysates were resolved on 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient
gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with polyclonal
antiserum against the S1 domain (upper panel), monoclonal antibodies against the VSV glycoprotein
(middle panel) and a monoclonal antibody against the VSV matrix protein (lower panel). VSV
glycoprotein expression was significantly reduced in cells infected with ConVac whereas matrix protein
expression was only modestly affected. (D) Viral growth curve on Vero cells. The cells were infected at
an MOI of 0.05 PFU with ConVac, or VSV expressing GFP or another control virus expressing Hendra
virus glycoprotein. Supernatants were collected 12, 24, and 36 hours post infection and titrated on Vero
E6 cells.

loads were determined in lung (B) and nasal turbinate (C) tissues 2 days and 4 days post challenge.
Right lungs and nasal turbinates from each animal were homogenized in media and titrated on Vero E6
cells. No virus was detected in the mock infected animals (data not shown). N = 4 for mock control
group (2 hamsters euthanized at each timepoint) and N = 8 for VSV vaccine group (4 hamsters
euthanized at each timepoint). Comparative pathology scores for lungs from SARS-CoV-2-infected and
mock-infected hamsters were determined 2 days (D2) and 4 days (D4) post challenge (D-H). Scores for
overall lung pathology (D), and individual criteria including consolidation or extent of inflammation (E),
type inflammatory foci (F), airway pathology (G) and septal thickening (H) are displayed. The pathology
scores (mean) were calculated based on the criteria described in Supplemental Table 1. Data represent
mean ± SD, N = 2 for each group at each timepoint. (I) Day 4 mock-infected lung displaying minimal
pathologic changes in airways. Note a septal thickening and alveolar wall damage (likely due to CO2
euthanasia). (J) Day 4 SARS-CoV2 infected lung displaying widespread inflammatory change, septal
thickening and airway infiltration.

Figure 1. Generation and characterization of ConVac. (A) Left: genome structure of the VSV vector expressing the
membrane anchored SARS-CoV2 S1 domain. The S1 domain of SARS-CoV2 spike protein (aa 1-681) was joined to the Cterminal 70 amino acids of the VSV glycoprotein. The fusion construct was inserted between the glycoprotein and
polymerase genes of VSV. The S1 domain is shown in red and the VSV G tail in green. The transmembrane domain of the
VSV glycoprotein is indicated by a yellow box. The amino acids at the junction between S1 and VSV glycoprotein are
highlighted. Right: schematic representation of the vaccine construct which shows the two transmembrane proteins
anchored in the membrane. (B) Immunofluorescence staining of Vero E6 cells infected with ConVac and a control virus
expressing Hendra virus G (VSV-HeVG). The cells were fixed and permeabilized 10 hours after infection and stained with
fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody CR3022 against the S1 domain (shown in red) and two monoclonal antibodies
against the VSV glycoprotein (shown in green). (C) Western blot analysis of BSR cells infected with Convac and a control
VSV virus expressing GFP. Protein lysates were resolved on 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with polyclonal antiserum against the S1 domain (upper panel),
monoclonal antibodies against the VSV glycoprotein (middle panel) and a monoclonal antibody against the VSV matrix
protein (lower panel). VSV glycoprotein expression was significantly reduced in cells infected with ConVac whereas matrix
protein expression was only modestly affected. (D) Viral growth curve on Vero cells. The cells were infected at an MOI of
0.05 PFU with ConVac, or VSV expressing GFP or another control virus expressing Hendra virus glycoprotein.
Supernatants were collected 12, 24, and 36 hours post infection and titrated on Vero E6 cells.

Figure 2. Pathogenicity and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters. Hamsters were challenged intranasally
with 105 PFU SARS-CoV-2 at day 0 and monitored for 4 days. (A) % change in body weight. SARS-CoV-2 group is shown in black,
and mock infected group in blue. Viral loads were determined in lung (B) and nasal turbinate (C) tissues 2 days and 4 days post
challenge. Right lungs and nasal turbinates from each animal were homogenized in media and titrated on Vero E6 cells. No virus
was detected in the mock infected animals (data not shown). N = 4 for mock control group (2 hamsters euthanized at each
timepoint) and N = 8 for VSV vaccine group (4 hamsters euthanized at each timepoint). Comparative pathology scores for lungs
from SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected hamsters were determined 2 days (D2) and 4 days (D4) post challenge (D-H).
Scores for overall lung pathology (D), and individual criteria including consolidation or extent of inflammation (E), type inflammatory
foci (F), airway pathology (G) and septal thickening (H) are displayed. The pathology scores (mean) were calculated based on the
criteria described in Supplemental Table 1. Data represent mean ± SD, N = 2 for each group at each timepoint. (I) Day 4 mockinfected lung displaying minimal pathologic changes in airways. Note a septal thickening and alveolar wall damage (likely due to
CO2 euthanasia). (J) Day 4 SARS-CoV2 infected lung displaying widespread inflammatory change, septal thickening and airway
infiltration.

Figure 6. SARS-CoV2 Lung pathology. Representative histopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in control and vaccinated hamster
lungs. Left panels: low magnification, right panels: higher magnification of selected regions, indicated by yellow asterisks on low
magnification images. Magnified images are representative of specific pathological findings, not the extent or severity of pathology
in a particular experimental group. A,B. Day 3 control: widespread consolidation and inflammatory infiltration is clearly visible, along
with obstruction of airways by inflammatory cells. Higher magnification illustrates airway infiltration by mononuclear cells, septal
thickening and airway occlusion. C,D Day 3 ConVac vaccine: moderate inflammatory changes with mononuclear cellular infiltration,
septal thickening, and mild airway pathology. Higher magnification illustrates focal infiltration by inflammatory cells. E,F. Day 15
control: typical interstitial pneumonic changes consisting small to large inflammatory foci, septal thickening and airway occlusion,
with fewer inflammatory cells. Higher magnification illustrates epithelia hyperplasia and damage in airways. G,H. Day 15 ConVac
vaccine: moderate interstitial pneumonia with septal thickening and mononuclear cellular infiltrates. Magnified image illustrates
reduced cellular infiltration of airways, but hyperplasia is still present.
