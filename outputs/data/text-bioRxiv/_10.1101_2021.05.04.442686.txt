ABSTRACT

39

The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays crucial role in virus life cycle by

40

replicating the viral RNA genome. The SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that rapidly spread

41

worldwide and during this process acquired mutations. This study was carried out to identify

42

mutations in RdRp as the SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. We compared the 668 RdRp

43

sequences reported from India with the first reported RdRp sequence from Wuhan, China.

44

Our data revealed that RdRp have acquired sixty mutations among Indian isolates. Our

45

protein modelling study also revealed that several mutants including D833Y, A699S, Y149C

46

and C464F can potentially alter stability and flexibility of RdRp. We also predicted the

47

potential B cell epitopes contributed by RdRp and identified thirty-six linear continuous and

48

twenty-five discontinuous epitopes. Among sixty RdRp mutants identified in this study, 40%

49

of them localises in the B cell epitopes region. Altogether, this study highlights the need to

50

identify and characterize the variations in RdRp to understand the impact of these mutations

51

on SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

76

SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 29 protein molecules which are categorised into three

77

groups including structural, non-structural and accessory proteins (Gordon et al., 2020).

78

SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins namely Spike glycoprotein, Membrane protein,

79

Envelope protein and Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (Wu et al., 2020). It also encodes

80

sixteen non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) and nine accessory proteins (Chan et al., 2020).

81

The non-structural proteins are involved in the maintenance of its genome, virulence and

82

important steps of virus life cycle. The 16 non-structural proteins are synthesised as a single

83

polypeptide molecule of 7096 amino acids known as Orf1ab that is subsequently cleaved

84

into 16 separate proteins (Chan et al., 2020). The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),

85

also known as Nsp12, is a non-structural protein that replicates SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome

86

(Wu et al., 2020). It associates with Nsp7 and Nsp8 and exist as a trimeric complex inside

87

the viral envelope structure (Peng et al., 2020). By itself, RdRp has a very weak polymerase

88

activity; however, the complex of RdRp with Nsp7 and Nsp8 significantly increases RdRp

89

processivity and template affinity (Te Velthuis et al., 2012; Zhai et al., 2005).

90

RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 is 932 residues in length and contains distinct polymerase and

91

nucleotide binding domains with a central connecting domain (Gao et al., 2020). Structurally,

92

RdRp is comprised of an N-terminal β-hairpin (residues 31-50) followed by an extended

93

nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl-transferase domain (NiRAN, residues 115-250) (Yin

94

et al., 2020). Following the NiRAN domain is an interface domain (residues 251-365)

95

connected to the RdRp domain (residues 366-920). Further, the domains of RdRp arranges

96

in such a way that it forms a canonical right-handed cup configuration (Mcdonald, 2013),

97

with the finger subdomain (resides 397-581 and residues 621-679) forming a closed circle

98

with the thumb subdomain (residues 819-920)(Yin et al., 2020).

99

The SARS-CoV-2 was first reported from Wuhan province China in late 2019 (Wu et al.,

100

2020). Wet sea food market area of Wuhan reported patients with pneumonia like

101

symptoms, which was later identified as SARS-CoV-2 because of its similarity with SARS-

102

CoV (Gorbalenya et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and causes mild to

103

severe respiratory distress in infected individuals and the disease has been named as

104

COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 spread very fast and within

105

few months reached almost all countries around the globe (Worldometers, 2020). As of 02nd

106

May 2021, there are more than 150 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and approximately

107

3 million deaths worldwide. This virus has caused global healthcare emergency because of

108

its fast spread and sudden exponential rise in the COVID-19 patients and declared

109

pandemic by world health organisation (WHO) (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). This pandemic

110

has caused enormous economic losses due to closure of most of the economic activities

111

worldwide.

112

As the SARS-CoV-2 spread to other geographical areas with different climatic conditions

113

compared to Wuhan, China, it started to mutate (Pachetti et al., 2020). The mutations

114

acquired by the SARS-CoV-2 are retained as a consequence of natural selection, if the

115

variants are more adaptable to the new conditions. In order to understand the variations

116

occurring in RdRp among Indian geographical area, we analysed 668 RdRp sequences

117

reported from India to identified sixty mutations. The B cell epitopes contributed by RdRp

118

were predicted in silico, their functional consequences as well as the possible effect of

119

mutations on them have been discussed.

121

MATERIAL AND METHODS

122

Protein Sequences retrieval from NCBI-virus-database

123

NCBI-virus-database is a repository for the nucleotide and protein sequences. This database

124

also has protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 that are available for users. We download the

125

sequences of Orf1ab that contains all non-structural proteins including the RdRp sequence

126

as described earlier (Azad, 2020). As of 10th April 2021, NCBI-virus-database has 668

127

sequences deposited from the Indian COVID-19 patients. The supplementary table 1 shows

128

the list of protein identifier accession number used in this analysis. The RdRp is located from

129

4393 to 5324 residues in Orf1ab which corresponds to 932 amino acids in length. The RdRp

130

reference or wild type sequence was also downloaded from NCBI virus database. The

131

accession number of reference sequence used in this study is YP_009724389 which is the

132

first reported sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China (Wu et al., 2020).

133
134

Identification of RdRp mutants by multiple sequence alignments (MSAs)

135

In order to identify the variations present in the RdRp sequences among Indian isolates of

136

SARS-CoV-2, the MSAs were conducted by Clustal omega programe (Madeira et al., 2019)

137

as described earlier (Azad, 2021a). First, we uploaded the RdRp sequences in Clustal

138

omega webserver and run the programe that uses HMM and pairwise alignment to generate

139

the data. The variations from the reference sequence were properly marked and used for

140

further analysis.

141
142

B cell epitope prediction

143

B cell prediction methods to predict Linear B cell epitopes based on sequence

144

characteristics of the antigen using amino acid scales and HMMs. The prediction of linear

145

continuous B cell epitopes were conducted by IEDB (Immune Epitope Database and

146

Analysis Resource) (Vita et al., 2019). The IEDB is an online server tool which predicts

147

epitopes by a prediction method known as ‘Bepipred linear epitope prediction method 2.0’.

148

For this prediction the threshold value of 0.500 was used during the evaluation.

149

The prediction of discontinuous B cell epitopes was performed by an online tool ‘DiscoTope

150

2.0’. For this prediction the threshold value was set at -3.7.

151
152

Protein modelling studies

153

We performed protein modelling studies to understand the variation observed in the

154

secondary structure might have any consequences on the three-dimensional structure of

155

protein. This analysis was performed by DynaMut programe (Rodrigues et al., 2018) as

156

described earlier (Azad, 2021b). This server uses the solved crystal structure of proteins and

157

predicts the effect of mutation on the stability, intramolecular interaction and molecular

158

fluctuations in the protein structure. For this study, we used recently reported structure of

159

RdRp (PDB ID: 7BV1)(Yin et al., 2020). The effect of mutations on protein is shown in terms

160

of difference in free energy (ΔΔG). The positive value indicates stabilizing mutation;

161

however, negative value represents destabilizing mutation. DynaMut provides difference in

162

vibrational entropy (ΔΔSvib ENCOM) between the wild type and mutant protein. The positive

163

ΔΔSvib ENCOM indicates increase in protein flexibility and negative ΔΔSvib ENCOM

164

represents increase in rigidity of protein structure due to mutations. We ran DynaMut

165

webserver to calculate the ΔΔG and ΔΔSvib ENCOM that provides the impact of mutation on

166

protein structure and stability. DynaMut server also provides the visual representation of the

167

intramolecular interactions contributed by wild type and mutant residues with the

168

neighbouring residues.

RESULTS

171
172

RdRp is frequently mutated among Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2

173

In order to identify the mutations in RdRp, we compared the first reported sequence of RdRp

174

from Wuhan, China with the sequences reported from India. In this analysis, we used 668

175

RdRp sequences reported from India and performed Clustal Omega mediated multiple

176

sequence alignment with an aim to identify variations in amino acids between the

177

sequences. The RdRp polypeptide sequence reported from Wuhan, China was used as wild

178

type sequence. Our data revealed sixty mutations present among the Indian sequences of

179

RdRp as shown in table 1. The table also shows the location of each mutation in the RdRp

180

polypeptide sequences and the effect of mutation on amino acid charge and polarity. The

181

mutations are also demonstrated on the schematic representation of RdRp as shown in

182

figure 1A and B. Our result show that the mutations are spreading all over the RdRp

183

polypeptide sequence. The distribution of mutations in different domains of RdRp has been

184

highlighted in figure 1B. Our MSA data strongly indicates that RdRp is one of the most

185

frequently mutated protein of SARS-CoV-2 because we observed sixty mutations in just 668

186

sequences analysed in this study.

187
188

Mutations affect RdRp protein dynamic stability and flexibility

189

We performed protein modelling studies using DynaMut programe to understand, if the

190

mutation observed in RdRp can alter protein structural integrity. The DynaMut programe

191

does protein modelling for those proteins whose crystal structure has been solved. For this

192

protein modelling study, we used recently reported crystal structure of RdRp (PDB ID:

193

7BV1)(Yin et al., 2020). First, we calculated the differences in free energy (ΔΔG) between

194

wild-type and mutant. Our data revealed that mutations at twenty-two positions cause

195

stabilisation in protein structure (positive ΔΔG) as shown in table 2, maximum positive ΔΔG

196

was obtained for D833Y (1.372 kcal/mol). Similarly, the mutations at twenty-eight positions

197

cause destabilisation (negative ΔΔG) in protein structure upon mutation (Table 2), maximum

198

negative ΔΔG was obtained for the mutant A699S (-2.233 kcal/mol).

199

Next, we measured the changes in vibrational entropy energy (ΔΔSVibENCoM) between the

200

wild type and the mutant. The negative and positive ΔΔSVibENCoM values depict the

201

rigidification and gain in protein flexibility upon mutation, respectively. Our data revealed that

202

mutation at twenty-seven positions causes increase in flexibility of mutant protein (positive

203

ΔΔSVibENCoM). The maximum positive ΔΔSVibENCoM was obtained for Y149C (1.065

204

kcal.mol-1.K-1) mutant. Similarly, the mutations at rest of the twenty-three positions cause

205

rigidification of protein structure (negative ΔΔSVibENCoM) in protein structure upon mutation

206

(Table 2). The maximum negative ΔΔSVibENCoM was obtained for C464F (-1.092 kcal.mol-

207

1.K-1) mutant. Altogether, our data revealed that the mutation observed in RdRp affects both

208

protein dynamicity and flexibility.

209
210

Identification of B cell epitopes of RdRp

211

The continuous B-cell epitopes of RdRp were predicted by IEDB webserver tool and the

212

epitopes are shown in figure 2A. The yellow area of the graph corresponds to those regions

213

of the RdRp that can potentially contribute to the B cell epitopes. Our data demonstrated

214

thirty-six epitopes of varying lengths that could potentially act as B cell epitopes (figure 2B).

215

Among those peptides, the ‘peptide 18’ is the largest epitopes, which is forty-four amino acid

216

in length (from RdRp residue 482 to 525). Similarly, peptide 5, 19, 30, 31 and 34 are

217

comprised of single amino acid only (figure 2B).

218

Subsequently, we predicted the B cell epitopes of RdRp based on its three dimensional

219

structure using DiscoTope 2.0 webserver tool (Kringelum et al., 2012).

220

revealed twenty-five discontinuous epitopes of RdRp having high score. The locations of

221

these epitopes are highlighted in figure 2C along with its propensity and DiscoTope score.

Our analysis

222

Among discontinuous epitopes, approximately 80% of them (20 out of 25) reside towards the

223

C-terminal end of RdRp (from residue 800 to 932) as shown in figure 2C. Altogether, our

224

data revealed B cell epitopes contributed by RdRp.

225
226

RdRp mutants preferentially localises in the B cell epitopes region

227

Subsequently, we analysed and compared the RdRp mutations that reside in the linear-

228

continuous and discontinuous B cell epitopes. Our data revealed that out of 60 mutants

229

observed in this study, 24 resides in the B cell epitope region of RdRp (figure 3A). These 24

230

mutants correspond to 40% of the total mutants observed among Indian isolates. The details

231

of all 24 mutants that localises in B cell epitope region are shown in figure 3B. Altogether,

232

our data strongly suggest that RdRp mutants preferentially localises in B cell epitope region.

233
234
235

DISCUSSION

236

The coronaviruses belongs to RNA viruses that exhibits high rate of mutations in their

237

genome (Benvenuto et al., 2020). As these viruses spread to new locations they keep on

238

acquiring mutations and few of them are naturally selected because of their beneficial effect

239

on the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 was first reported from Wuhan, china and within a span of

240

few months it spread to almost all countries worldwide (Worldometers, 2020). The

241

researchers around the globe sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 to understand the genomic

242

properties of this virus and soon identify various mutations. The investigation on the genomic

243

variation acquired by SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for understanding the epidemiology,

244

pathogenesis; devise preventive measures and treatment strategies against COVID-19.

245

The earlier variation studies on SARS-CoV-2 revealed that RdRp is among the mutational

246

hotspot protein (Pachetti et al., 2020). In the similar directions, this study was conducted with

247

an aim to identify mutations in RdRp from Indian isolates. Our earlier study revealed seven

248

crucial mutations in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 (Chand et al., 2020) that can have potential

249

impact on this protein function. The present study identifies and characterises B cell epitope

250

contributed by RdRp and correlate them with the observed mutants. In this study, we

251

analysed 668 RdRp sequences reported from India till April 2021 date and identified sixty

252

mutations in RdRp. Our protein modelling studies revealed various interesting mutations

253

including D833Y, A699S, Y149C and C464F (table 2) that can potentially affect stability and

254

flexibility of RdRp. So far, we analysed 668 sequences from India and identified sixty

255

mutations which indicates that RdRp is one of the mutational hotspot protein of SARS-CoV-2

256

in India. Furthermore, we did prediction study to identify B cell epitopes contributed by RdRp.

257

Our data revealed that there are thirty-six high rank linear- continuous B cell epitope as well

258

as twenty-five discontinuous B cell epitopes. Moreover, we also identified that out of sixty

259

mutants identified among Indian isolates, twenty-four resides (40%) in these B cell epitope

260

region.

261

The variations in RdRp or any other protein of SARS-CoV-2 will possibly tell us how the virus

262

is evolving. Earlier studies with RNA viruses have also shown that these viruses keep on

263

mutating to better adapt and survive in the host (Sanjuán and Domingo-Calap, 2016). Here,

264

in this study, we have reported RdRp mutations, its correlation with B cell epitopes.

265

However, it warrants future studies to understand the possible effect of these mutations on

266

virus infectivity and life cycle.

267
268

CONCLUSIONS

269

The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 have adverse impact on health services worldwide

270

with economic fallout of most of the countries. Understanding the genetic variations in

271

SARS-CoV-2 will help to better devise the preventive and treatment strategies against this

272

virus. Here, our data show various mutations in RdRp from India and their impact on B cell

273

epitopes by in silico studies. Altogether, the data presented here could help scientific

274

community to better understand the immunological aspect of SARS-CoV-2.
