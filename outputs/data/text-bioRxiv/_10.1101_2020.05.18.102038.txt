ABSTRACT

26

Antibody-based interventions against SARS-CoV-2 could limit morbidity, mortality, and

27

possibly disrupt epidemic transmission. An anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the

28

level of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, yet there is no consensus

29

as to which assay should be used for such measurements. Using an infectious molecular clone

30

of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the

31

glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and

32

developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2. We also

33

developed a focus reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety

34

level 3. We compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody

35

preparations, as well as ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally

36

high degree of concordance. The two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-

37

based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies, immune γ-globulin or plasma

38

preparations, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Replication-competent VSV-eGFP-SARS-

39

CoV-2 provides a rapid assay for testing inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 mediated entry that can be

40

performed in 7.5 hours under reduced biosafety containment.

INTRODUCTION

43

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense,

44

single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that was first isolated in Wuhan, China in December, 2019

45

from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (Guan et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic

46

agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which as of May 16, 2020 has more than 4.5

47

million confirmed cases causing 309,000 deaths. Virtually all countries and territories have been

48

affected, with major epidemics in Central China, Italy, Spain, France, Iran, Russia, the United

49

Kingdom, and the United States. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be of zoonotic origin and is closely

50

related to the original SARS-CoV (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Most cases are spread

51

by direct human-to-human transmission, with community transmission occurring from both

52

symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (Bai et al., 2020). This has resulted in a global

53

pandemic with severe economic, political, and social consequences. The development,

54

characterization, and deployment of an effective vaccine or antibody prophylaxis or treatment

55

against SARS-CoV-2 could prevent morbidity and mortality and curtail its epidemic spread.

56

The viral spike protein (S) mediates all steps of coronavirus entry into target cells including

57

receptor binding and membrane fusion (Tortorici and Veesler, 2019). During viral biogenesis the

58

S protein undergoes furin-dependent proteolytic processing as it transits through the trans-Golgi

59

network and is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits that function in receptor binding and membrane

60

fusion, respectively (Walls et al., 2020). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a

61

cell surface receptor (Letko et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) for SARS-CoV-2, and productive

62

infection is facilitated by additional processing of S2 by the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2

63

(Hoffmann et al., 2020).

64

Laboratory studies of SARS-CoV-2 require biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment with

65

positive-pressure respirators. Single-round pseudotyped viruses complemented by expression of

66

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in trans serve as biosafety level 2 (BSL2) surrogates that can facilitate

67

studies of viral entry, and the inhibition of infection by neutralizing antibodies and other inhibitors

68

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020). Such pseudotyping approaches are used

69

routinely by many laboratories for other highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV

70

and MERS-CoV (Fukushi et al., 2006; Fukushi et al., 2005; Giroglou et al., 2004; Kobinger et al.,

71

2007). Viral pseudotyping assays are limited by the need to express the glycoprotein in trans and

72

preclude forward genetic studies of the viral envelope protein. Expression of the glycoprotein is

73

often accomplished by plasmid transfection, which requires optimization to minimize batch

74

variation. Assays performed with such pseudotyped viruses rely on relative levels of infectivity as

75

measured by a reporter assay without correlation to an infectious titer. It also is unknown as to

76

how the display of S proteins on a heterologous virus impacts viral entry, antibody recognition,

77

and antibody neutralization compared to infectious coronavirus. This question is important

78

because neutralization assays are used to establish correlates of protection for vaccine and

79

antibody-based countermeasures, and most manufacturers lack access to high-containment

80

laboratories to test antibody responses against highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-

81

CoV-2.

82

Here, we developed a simple and robust BSL2 assay for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 entry

83

and its inhibition by antibodies. We engineered an infectious molecular clone of vesicular

84

stomatitis virus (VSV) to encode the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in place of the native envelope

85

glycoprotein (G) and rescued an autonomously replication-competent virus bearing the spike.

86

Through passage of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2, we selected a gain-of-function mutation in S that

87

allowed more efficient viral propagation yielding titers of > 1 x 108 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml.

88

We characterized this variant with respect to inhibition by soluble human ACE2-Fc and

89

monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from humans and compared those results to neutralization

90

tests with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. These studies demonstrate that a recombinant VSV

91

expressing SARS-CoV-2 S behaves analogously to a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, providing a

92

useful high-throughput BSL2 assay for studying antibody neutralization or inhibition of viral spike-

93

mediated entry.

RESULTS

95

A replication-competent, infectious VSV chimera with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To

96

generate a replication-competent virus to study entry and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 at BSL2,

97

we engineered an infectious molecular clone of VSV by replacing the endogenous glycoprotein

98

(G) with SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig 1A). SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)

99

retention sequence in the cytoplasmic tail (KxHxx-COOH) because virion assembly occurs in ER-

100

Golgi intermediate compartments (Lontok et al., 2004; McBride et al., 2007; Ruch and Machamer,

101

2012). We preemptively altered that sequence to AxAxx to facilitate retargeting of S to the plasma

102

membrane, the site of VSV assembly. Using established approaches (Fig S1A) (Whelan et al.,

103

1995), we recovered infectious VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-SAA as determined by expression of the

104

virus-encoded eGFP reporter (Fig 1A, right panel). VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-SAA propagation

105

was inefficient on Vero CCL81 cells. This result prompted us to test additional modifications of

106

the cytoplasmic tail of S, which were also defective in autonomous amplification (Fig S1B). To

107

overcome this limitation, we used a forward genetic approach to isolate an adaptive variant of

108

VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-SAA (Fig S1C). Repeated passage and plaque isolation on Vero CCL81

109

cells led to the emergence of a virus that contained a cysteine to stop mutation at residue 1253

110

(TGC to TGA at nucleotide 3759), which truncates the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 S by 21

111

residues (Fig 1A). We confirmed that this was the only mutation in the viral genome by next

112

generation sequencing (Supplemental Data). Comparison of plaque morphology of VSV-eGFP-

113

SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-SAA on three Vero cell subtypes and an

114

additional rhesus monkey cell line (MA104) demonstrates that the selected variant spreads more

115

efficiently (Fig 1B). Screening of a larger panel of cell types (Fig 1C) identified MA104 and Vero

116

E6 cells as supporting the highest levels of virus production. Ectopic expression of TMPRSS2 led

117

to a further ~10-fold increase in viral titer and a larger plaque size (Fig 1D).

118

SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 is incorporated into infectious VSV particles. To confirm

119

incorporation of SARS-CoV-2 S into particles, we first amplified the virus in the presence of VSV

120

G to allow infection of cell types independently of the S protein. The VSV G trans-complemented

121

VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 efficiently infects HEK293T cells, which then serve as a source of

122

production of virus particles containing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Western blotting of supernatants

123

with CR3022, a cross-reactive anti-S monoclonal antibody (mAb) (ter Meulen et al., 2006; Yuan

124

et al., 2020), established the presence of SΔ21 in VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 particles but not in the

125

parental VSV (Fig 1E). The protein detected migrated at ~100 kilodaltons, a band that

126

corresponds to the cleaved S1 subunit of the glycoprotein (Watanabe et al., 2020). To examine

127

whether the SΔ21 incorporated into VSV particles is processed to S1 and S2, we performed [35S]

128

cysteine-methionine metabolic labeling in BSRT7 cells, which support robust VSV replication, and

129

analyzed released particles by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. In addition to the VSV

130

structural proteins (N, P, M and L), two additional bands were observed for VSV-SARS-CoV-2-

131

SΔ21 that correspond in size to glycosylated S1 (107 kDa) and S2Δ21 (85 kDa) (Fig 1F). Negative-

132

stain electron microscopy of sucrose-gradient purified virus particles revealed that the membrane

133

protein projecting from VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 is larger than observed on wild-type VSV particles

134

(Fig 1G), which reflects the larger size of the coronavirus spike.

135

A high-throughput focus-forming assay with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. VSV-

136

SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 has several advantages for detection and measuring of neutralizing antibodies,

137

including lower biosafety containment level, ease of production and use, and rapid reporter gene

138

readout. Nonetheless, the difference in virus morphology (spherical CoV versus bullet-shaped

139

VSV) and possible effects on the conformational display of S on the virion surface, raise questions

140

as to whether the accessibility of epitopes and stoichiometry of antibody neutralization is similar

141

to authentic SARS-CoV-2. A direct comparison with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary

142

to establish the utility of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 for assays of viral entry and antibody

143

neutralization.

144

We designed a high-throughput assay for titrating SARS-CoV-2 that could be applied to

145

multiple cell substrates. Instead of using a plaque assay, which relies on the capacity for a virus

146

to cause cell death, which can vary across cell types, we developed a focus-forming assay (FFA)

147

and viral antigen detection as a measure of infectivity. We propagated SARS-CoV-2 in four

148

different producer cell types (Vero CCL81, Vero E6, Vero-furin, and MA104 cells) and then

149

measured the number and size of foci after staining recipient cells with an anti-S mAb. With SARS-

150

CoV-2 stocks generated from each producer cell type, we observed distinct foci across recipient

151

cell substrates at approximately 30 h post-inoculation (Fig 2A). We consistently observed the

152

highest viral titers and largest foci sizes with Vero-furin and MA104 cells (Fig 2B-C). However,

153

the larger foci were more difficult to enumerate on an automated Immunospot reader and required

154

additional manual quality control analysis. Because of this, we used Vero E6 cells for our rapid

155

focus-reduction neutralization tests (FRNT) in subsequent experiments.

156

A high-throughput, eGFP-based neutralization assay for VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21. In

157

parallel, we developed a high-throughput method to measure neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-

158

2-SΔ21. As VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 encodes an eGFP reporter and viral gene expression is robust,

159

eGFP-positive cells can be quantified 7.5 h post-infection using a fluorescence microscope with

160

automated counting analysis software. This approach enabled the development of an eGFP-

161

reduction neutralization test (GRNT) (Fig 2D).

162

Neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2 by human antibodies.

163

Members of our group recently identified human mAbs from memory B cells of a SARS-CoV

164

survivor that bind to SARS-CoV-2 S (Pinto et al, 2020). We tested a subset of these (mAbs 304,

165

306, 309, and 315) for their ability to inhibit VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2 infections

166

on Vero E6 cells. While three of these mAbs showed poor inhibitory activity, mAb 309 potently

167

neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 (Fig 3A-B) with similar EC50 values

168

between the two assays (81 and 67 ng/mL for SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21,

169

respectively). To broaden the test panel, we evaluated the activity of a panel of mAbs generated

170

as part of a phage display library (Sachev Sidhu, unpublished data) by both FRNT and GRNT.

171

Many of these mAbs exhibited moderate neutralization activities in the EC50 range of 100 to 500

7

172

ng/mL (Fig 3C-D). Nonetheless, we observed the same neutralization trend between VSV-SARS-

173

CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2 with highly correlated EC50 values (< 2-fold differences).

174

Neutralization by human ACE2-Fc receptor decoy proteins. Human ACE2 (hACE2) is

175

an entry receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Letko et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005; Li et

176

al., 2003; Wrapp et al., 2020). As a soluble hACE2-Fc decoy protein has been proposed as a

177

therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 (Kruse, 2020), in part based on its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV

178

infection in cell culture (Moore et al., 2004), we tested whether hACE2-Fc could inhibit infection

179

of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2 using our FRNT and GRNT assays. When pre-mixed

180

with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 or SARS-CoV-2, hACE2-Fc, but not murine ACE2-Fc (mACE2-Fc),

181

dose-dependently and equivalently inhibited infection of recipient Vero E6 cells (Fig 3E-F). As

182

expected, hACE2-Fc did not inhibit infection of wild-type VSV confirming that neutralization was

183

specific to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig S2). We noted a relatively high concentration of

184

hACE2-Fc was required for inhibition with EC50 values of 29 and 12.6 μg/ml for VSV-SARS-CoV-

185

2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Thus, although soluble hACE2-Fc decoy proteins similarly

186

inhibit infection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2, the potency is less than anticipated,

187

which suggests that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the S protein on the surface of both

188

viruses may not be fully accessible in solution.

189

Neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2 by human immune serum.

190

As part of studies to evaluate immune convalescent plasma as a possible therapy for SARS-CoV-

191

2 infected patients (Bloch et al., 2020), we obtained 42 serum samples from 20 individuals at

192

different time points after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (Table 1). These samples were pre-

193

screened using a commercially available IgG ELISA. We tested each sample for neutralization of

194

VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells. We observed that sera with ELISA

195

negative or indeterminate results generally showed low inhibitory titers (EC50 <1/100), whereas

196

ELISA positive sera generated a broad range of neutralizing antibody activity (EC50 > 1/200 to

197

>1/1,900) (Fig 4A and C, Fig S3). Remarkably, neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and

198

SARS-CoV-2 was similar across the entire panel of samples (Fig 4B and C, Fig S3).

are

highly

correlative. We determined the extent to which the VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and SARS-CoV-2

201

neutralization tests correlated with each other. We compared the GRNT and FRNT EC50 values

202

obtained in assays with mAbs, polyclonal sera, and soluble ACE2 protein (Fig 5). For the samples

203

with neutralizing activity, we observed a remarkably strong correlation between the two assays (r

204

= 0.9285; p < 0.001). Moreover, all 11 of the samples that were deemed non-neutralizing in one

205

assay had the same result in the second assay. Together, these results establish the utility of

206

using VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 as a surrogate for authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in entry

inhibition and neutralization studies.

DISCUSSION

210

Emerging viral pathogens have caused numerous epidemics and several pandemics over

211

the last century. The most recent example, SARS-CoV-2, has spread to nearly every country in

212

the world in just a few months, causing millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths

213

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Rapid responses to viral outbreaks and generation

214

of countermeasures require readily accessible tools to facilitate study and evaluate antiviral

215

activity. Here, we generated a high-titer, replication-competent chimeric VSV expressing the

216

SARS-CoV-2 S protein that performs similarly to a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate across multiple

217

neutralization tests. As access to BSL3 facilities is limited, the finding that VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21

218

is neutralized similarly by decoy receptors, mAbs, and polyclonal antibodies in comparison to

219

authentic SARS-CoV-2 is important. This tool will enable academic, government, and industry

220

investigators to rapidly perform assays that interrogate SARS-CoV-2 entry, neutralization, and

221

inhibition at a BSL2 level, which should simplify and expedite the discovery of therapeutic

222

interventions and analysis of functional humoral immune responses.

223

Upon recovery of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SAA, we selected for a mutant, which contained a 21-

224

amino acid deletion in the cytoplasmic tail. As truncation of the cytoplasmic tail eliminates the

225

modified KxHxx ER retention signal, we suggest that this mutation facilitates more efficient

226

incorporation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein into the VSV particles. Although truncation of the

227

cytoplasmic tail of HIV envelope protein resulted in conformational alterations in the ectodomain

228

of the protein (Chen et al., 2015), based on the extensive neutralization data presented here

229

including correlation to neutralization of a clinical isolate of SARS CoV-2, a 21-amino acid

230

truncation does not appear to substantively alter the structure of the S protein ectodomain. It

231

remains to be determined whether fully wild-type S protein can incorporate efficiently into VSV.

232

Indeed, similar mutations were generated in the SARS-CoV S protein cytoplasmic tail to boost

233

incorporation into retroviruses and VSV pseudotypes (Fukushi et al., 2005; Giroglou et al., 2004;

234

Moore et al., 2004).

235

The value of a chimeric virus depends on its capacity to present viral surface antigens in

236

a similar way to its authentic counterpart (Garbutt et al., 2004). Indeed, the morphology of the

237

bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and the spherical coronavirus and the density and geometry of S

238

protein display could differentially impact antibody engagement and neutralization. Despite this

239

concern, our extensive testing of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 with antibodies and soluble ACE2-Fc

240

proteins showed similar neutralization profiles compared to authentic, fully infectious SARS-CoV-

241

2. Thus, VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21, despite the structural differences of the virion, provides a useful

242

tool for screening antibodies, entry-based antiviral agents, and vaccine responses against SARS-

243

CoV-2. Indeed, convalescent plasma is under investigation as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic

244

(Chen et al., 2020). Our studies suggest that in addition to testing for anti-S or anti-RBD antibodies

245

(Shen et al., 2020), neutralization assays with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 may be a convenient and

246

rapid method to obtain functional information about immune plasma preparations to enable

247

prioritization prior to passive transfer to COVID-19 patients.

248

Coronaviruses possess a roughly 30 kb RNA genome, which requires that they encode a

249

proofreading enzyme (ExoN in nsp14) (Denison et al., 2011) to counteract the error rate of the

250

viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The lack of such proofreading enzymes in the genomes

251

of rhabdoviruses suggests that selection of escape mutants to inhibitors of the coronavirus S

252

protein will be faster in VSV-SARS-CoV-2, which further increases the utility of this chimeric virus.

253

Our FRNT and GRNT assays can be used to establish evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

254

or vaccination, as well as determine waning of functional responses over time, as the likelihood

255

of cross-neutralizing responses with other cosmopolitan coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E and

256

HCoV-OC43) is exceedingly low. Overall, VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 and our FRNT and GRNT

257

assays, can facilitate the development and evaluation of antibody- or entry-based

258

countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

366

METHODS

367

Plasmids. The S gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank MN908947.3) was

368

synthesized in two fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies) and inserted into an infectious

369

molecular clone of VSV (Whelan et al., 1995) as previously (Carette et al., 2011; Jae et al., 2014).

370

Modifications to the cytoplasmic tail were assembled identically. Other plasmids were previously

371

described: VSV N, P, L and G expression plasmids (Stanifer et al., 2011; Whelan et al., 1995),

372

psPAX2 (Addgene), and pLX304-TMPRSS2 (Zang et al., 2020).

373

Cells. Cells were maintained in humidified incubators at 34 or 37°C and 5% CO2 in the

374

indicated media. BSRT7/5, Vero CCL81, Vero E6, Vero E6-TMPRSS2, A549, Caco-2, Caco-2

375

BBe1, Huh7, HepG2, Hela, BHK-21, HEK293, and HEK293T were maintained in DMEM (Corning

376

or VWR) supplemented with glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum

377

(FBS). Vero-furin cells (Mukherjee et al., 2016) also were supplemented with 5 μg/ml of blasticidin.

378

MA104 cells were maintained in Medium 199 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS. HT-29 cells were

379

cultured in complete DMEM/F12 (Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with sodium pyruvate, non-

380

essential amino acids, and HEPES. Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells were generated using a lentivirus

381

vector. Briefly, HEK293T producer cells were transfected with pLX304-TMPRSS2, pCAGGS-

382

VSV-G, and psPAX2, and cell culture supernatants were collected at 48 hours and clarified by

383

centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min. The resulting lentivirus was used to infect Vero E6 cells for

384

24 h, and cells were selected with 40 μg/ml blasticidin for 7 days.

385

Recombinant VSV. Recovery of recombinant VSV was performed as described (Whelan

386

et al., 1995). Briefly, BSRT7/5 cells were inoculated with vaccinia virus vTF7-3 and subsequently

387

transfected with T7-expression plasmids encoding VSV N, P, L, and G, and an antigenomic copy

388

of the viral genome. Cell culture supernatants were collected at 56-72 h, clarified by centrifugation

389

(5 min at 1,000 x g), and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. Virus was plaque-purified on Vero CCL81

390

cells in the presence of 25 μg/ml of cytosine arabinoside (TriLink BioTechnologies), and plaques

391

in agarose plugs were amplified on Vero CCL81 cells. Viral stocks were amplified on MA104 cells

392

at an MOI of 0.01 in Medium 199 containing 2% FBS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.7 (Millipore Sigma)

393

at 34°C. Viral supernatants were harvested upon extensive cytopathic effect and clarified of cell

394

debris by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Aliquots were maintained at -80°C.

395

Next generation sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from Vero CCL81 cells infected

396

with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

397

RNA was used to generate next generation sequencing libraries using TruSeq Stranded Total

398

RNA library kit with Ribo Zero ribosomal subtraction (Illumina). The libraries were quantified using

399

a bioanalyzer (Agilent) and pooled at an equal molar concentration and used to generate paired

400

end 250 bp reads on an MiSeq (Illumina). Raw sequencing data was processed using fastp

401

v0.20.0 to trim adapters and filter out reads with a quality score < 30. Alignment of each sample

402

to VSV and SARS CoV-2 sequence was performed using bbmap v38.79. Mapped reads were

403

extracted using samtools 1.9 and used for de novo assembly by SPAdes v3.13.0. Consensus

404

sequences for each RNA sample were generated by aligning contigs to the reference plasmid

405

sequence pVSV(1+)-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S with SnapGene v5.0.

406

Western blotting. Purified VSV were incubated in non-reducing denaturation buffer (55

407

mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 1.67 % (w/v) SDS, 7.5 % (w/v) glycerol) at 100°C for 5 min. Viral proteins

408

were separated on a 8% acrylamide gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and

409

incubated with human anti-SARS antibody CR3022 diluted in Tris-buffer saline containing 1%

410

Tween-20 (TBS-T) and 5% milk, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human

411

antibody (Abcam) diluted in TBS-T containing 1% milk. HRP activity was visualized using the

412

Pierce ECL Western blotting kit (Thermo Scientific) and imaged with a ChemiDocTM MP Imager

413

(Bio-Rad).

414

Metabolic radiolabeling of virions. To generate high titer stocks of VSV-SARS-CoV-2,

415

BSRT7/5 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-VSV-G in Opti-MEM (Gibco) using Lipofectamine

416

2000 (Invitrogen) and infected 7 h later with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 at an MOI of 0.1 in DMEM

417

containing 2% FBS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.7. Viral stocks were collected at 48 hpi, and used to

418

infect fresh cells (MOI of 10) for labeling of viral proteins. At 4 hpi, cells were starved in serum

419

free, methionine/cysteine free DMEM (Corning), and exposed to 15 µCi/ml [35S]-methionine and

420

[35S]-cysteine (Perkin Elmer) from 5-24 hours. Cell culture supernatants were collected, clarified

421

by centrifugation (1,500 x g, 5 min), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by phosphoimage

422

analysis (Li et al., 2006).

423

Transmission electron microscopy. Purified viruses were adhered to glow-discharged,

424

carbon-coated copper grids. Samples were stained with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.1,

425

in H2O and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc.)

426

equipped with an AMT 8-megapixel digital camera and AMT Image Capture Engine V602

427

software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques).

428

Monoclonal antibodies. Phage-displayed Fab libraries were panned against immobilized

429

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in multiple rounds using established methods (Persson et al., 2013).

430

Following four rounds of selection, phage ELISAs were used to screen 384 clones to identify

431

those that bound specifically to RBD. The complementarity determining regions of Fab-phage

432

clones were decoded by sequencing the variable regions and cloning them into mammalian

433

expression vectors for expression and purification of human IgG1 proteins, as described (Tao et

434

al., 2019). A subset of the panel of mAbs was tested for neutralization as a part of this study.

435

Another set of mAbs (S304, S306, S309, S310 and S315) were isolated from EBV-

436

immortalized memory B cells from a SARS-CoV survivor (Traggiai et al., 2004) and are cross-

437

reactive to SARS-CoV-2 (Pinto et al, in press). Recombinant antibodies were expressed in

438

ExpiCHO cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing the heavy and light chain as

439

previously described (Stettler et al., 2016).

440

Human sera. Human samples were collected from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients.

441

Serum samples were obtained by routine phlebotomy at different days post symptom onset

442

(range: day 5 - 20). Samples were prescreened by the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA

443

(Lubeck, Germany), a qualitative assay with the Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use

444

Authorization that detects antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. This study was approved by

445

the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.

446

Protein expression and purification. DNA fragments encoding human ACE2 (hACE2

447

residues 1-615) and mouse ACE2 (mACE2, residues 1-615) were synthesized and cloned into

448

pFM1.2 with a C-terminal HRV-3C protease cleavage site (LEVLFQGP) and a human IgG1 Fc

449

region as previously described (Raj et al., 2013). We transiently transfected plasmids into

450

Expi293F cells and harvested cell supernatants 4 days post transfection. Secreted hACE2-Fc and

451

mACE2-Fc proteins were purified by protein A chromatography (Goldbio).

452

GFP-reduction neutralization test. Patient samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30

453

min. Indicated dilutions of samples were incubated with 102 PFU of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 for 1

454

h at 37°C. Antibody-virus complexes were added to Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates and incubated

455

at 37°C for 7.5 h. Cells subsequently were fixed in 2% formaldehyde containing 10 µg/mL Hoechst

456

33342 nuclear stain (Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature, when fixative was replaced with

457

PBS. Images were acquired with the InCell 2000 Analyzer (GE Healthcare) automated

458

microscope in both the DAPI and FITC channels to visualize nuclei and infected cells (i.e., eGFP-

459

positive cells), respectively (4X objective, 4 fields per well, covering the entire well). Images were

460

analyzed using the Multi Target Analysis Module of the InCell Analyzer 1000 Workstation

461

Software (GE Healthcare). GFP-positive cells were identified in the FITC channel using the top-

462

hat segmentation method and subsequently counted within the InCell Workstation software. The

463

sensitivity and accuracy of GFP-positive cell number determinations were validated using a serial

464

dilution of virus. A background number of GFP+ cells was subtracted from each well using an

465

average value determined from at least 4 uninfected wells. Data were processed using Prism

466

software (GraphPad Prism 8.0). ACE2 neutralization assays using VSV-SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 were

467

conducted similarly but using an MOI of 1.

Focus reduction neutralization test. SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019 n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020

469

was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (gift of Natalie Thornburg).

470

Virus was passaged in the indicated producer cells. Indicated dilutions of mAbs, sera, or protein

471

were incubated with 102 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. Antibody-virus complexes were

472

added to indicated cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently,

473

cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Plates

474

were harvested 30 h later by removing overlays and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for

475

20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and sequentially incubated with 1 µg/mL of

476

Legend to Table 1: Serum samples from 20 individuals were collected at different time points
post onset of COVID-19 symptoms, were screened using two ELISA assays (Euroimmun or
Epitope). The serum numbers correspond to those of Figures 4 and S3. IgG index values were
calculated by dividing the O.D. of the serum sample by a reference O.D. control, and ratios were
interpreted using the following criteria as recommended by the manufacturer: Negative (-) <0.8,
Indeterminate (+/-) 0.8-1.1, Positive (+) ≥1.1.
