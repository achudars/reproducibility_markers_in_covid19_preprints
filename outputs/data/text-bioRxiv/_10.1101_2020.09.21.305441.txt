ABSTRACT

25

Epitopes that are conserved among SARS-like coronaviruses are attractive targets for

26

design of cross-reactive vaccines and therapeutics. CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing

27

antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike

28

protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray

29

crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino

30

acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single

31

mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize

32

SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables

33

neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022

34

interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three

35

CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to

36

considerable flexibility of the RBD. In one of these conformations, quaternary interactions

37

are made by CR3022 to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of an adjacent subunit. Overall, this

38

study provides insights into antigenic variation and potential for cross-neutralizing epitopes

39

on SARS-like viruses.

INTRODUCTION

41

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-

42

2, continues to escalate. Investigating the immunogenicity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-

43

2 is of great importance for vaccine and therapeutic development. The major antigen of

44

coronavirus is the spike (S) glycoprotein, which is expressed as a homotrimer on the virus

45

surface. Since the S protein is essential for virus entry through engaging the host receptor

46

and mediating virus-host membrane fusion, many antibodies to the S protein are

47

neutralizing [1-12]. The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused a global

48

outbreak in 2003, have an amino-acid sequence identity of around 77% [13] that leads to

49

differences in antigenicity in serology studies [14, 15]. Although a few monoclonal

50

antibodies have been discovered that can cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

51

[6, 7, 16, 17], they seem to be relatively rare in COVID-19 patients [1, 3, 4, 14]. Thus, the

52

molecular determinants that define the antigenic differences and similarities between

53

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV need further exploration.

54
55

CR3022 was previously isolated from a SARS survivor and neutralizes SARS-CoV [18],

56

CR3022 was recently found to also be a cross-reactive antibody that can bind to both

57

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [19]. Our recent crystal structure demonstrated that CR3022

58

targets a highly conserved cryptic epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S

59

protein [20]. The CR3022 epitope is exposed only when the RBD is in the “up” but not the

60

“down” conformation on the S protein [20]. A few SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from COVID-19

61

patients have also recently been shown to target the CR3022 epitope [12, 17, 21],

62

suggesting that it is an important site of vulnerability for the antibody response in SARS-

63

CoV-2 infection. Out of 28 residues in the CR3022 epitope, 24 are conserved between

64

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, explaining the cross-reactive binding of CR3022. However,

65

CR3022 has a higher affinity to SARS-CoV than to SARS-CoV-2 (>100-fold difference),

66

and can neutralize SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, in a live virus neutralization assay

67

[20]. Therefore, CR3022 provides a good case study to probe antigenic variation between

68

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

69
70

We therefore aimed to dissect the molecular basis underlying the difference in binding

71

affinity and neutralization potency of CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The crystal

72

structure of SARS-CoV RBD in complex with CR3022 was determined to compare with

73

the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 RBD structure [20]. In combination of mutagenesis and

74

binding experiments, we demonstrate that a single amino-acid difference at residue 384

75

(SARS-CoV-2 numbering) between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can fully

76

explain the affinity difference with CR3022. Moreover, CR3022 is now able to neutralize

77

SARS-CoV-2 P384A with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated the

78

molecular recognition of CR3022 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by electron microscopy

79

and found that rotational flexibility of the RBD resulted in antibody binding to different

80

variants of up-conformations of the RBD relative to the spike trimer. Our findings validate

81

the CR3022 epitope as an important site of vulnerability for a cross-neutralizing antibody

82

response. Throughout this study, residues on RBD are numbered according to SARS-

83

CoV-2 numbering unless otherwise stated.

84
85

RESULTS

86

P384A increases binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to CR3022

87

The epitope of CR3022 in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV differs by four residues. We

88

aimed to determine whether amino-acid variants in these four non-conserved residues

89

influence the binding affinity of CR3022 to RBD. Four SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants, namely

90

A372T, P384A, T430M, and H519N (SARS-CoV-2 numbering), were recombinantly

91

expressed and examined (Figure 1A). These mutants converted the amino-acid sequence

92

of the CR3022 epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to that of SARS-CoV at each of the four

93

non-conserved residues. While binding of CR3022 mutants A372T (KD = 66 nM), T430M

94

(KD = 64 nM), and H519N (KD = 60 nM) was comparable to wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2

95

RBD (KD = 68 nM), binding of CR3022 to the P384A mutant (KD = 1.4 nM) was greatly

96

increased (Figure 1B), akin now to that with the SARS-CoV RBD (KD = 1.0 nM) [20]. Thus,

97

the difference in binding affinity of CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD versus SARS-CoV RBD

98

can be attributed due to a single amino-acid difference at residue 384.

99
100

CR3022 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 P384A but not WT

101

While CR3022 can neutralize SARS-CoV [18, 20], multiple groups have shown that it does

102

not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [3, 5, 20, 22]. One possibility is that the affinity of CR3022 to

103

SARS-CoV-2 RBD is not sufficient to confer neutralizing activity. To test this hypothesis,

104

we compared neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 WT and the P384A mutant by CR3022.

105

Consistent with previous studies [3, 5, 20, 22], CR3022 failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2

106

WT (Figure 2). However, CR3022 is now able to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 P384A

107

mutant at an IC50 of 3.2 μg/ml, which is comparable to its neutralizing activity to SARS-

108

CoV (IC50 of 5.2 μg/ml). This finding validates the CR3022 epitope as a neutralizing

109

epitope in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, provided that the antibody affinity can

110

surpass a threshold for detection of neutralization.

111
112

Previous studies have indicated IgG bivalent binding can play an important role in

113

mediating neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, since the neutralization potency for many

114

antibodies is much greater when expressed as IgG rather than Fab [21, 23]. Subsequently,

115

we also tested the neutralizing activity of CR3022 Fab. Interestingly, the CR3022 Fab

116

neutralized SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant with an IC50 of 4.4 μg/ml, which is similar to that

117

of CR3022 IgG (3.2 μg/ml) (Figure 2). This result indicates that CR3022, unlike many other

118

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [21, 23], does not act bivalently with the S proteins on the virus

119

surface and, hence, neutralization is more sensitive to Fab binding affinity.

120
121

Sequence conservation of residue 384

122

We then examined the sequence conservation of residue 384 in other SARS-related

123

coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) strains. Most SARSr-CoV strains have Pro at residue 384,

124

as in SARS-CoV-2. Only those strains that are phylogenetically very close to SARS-CoV,

125

such as bat SARSr-CoV WIV1 and bat SARSr-CoV WIV16, have Ala at residue 384

126

(Figure 3A). Phylogenetic analysis implies that P384A emerged during the evolution of

127

SARSr-CoV in bats (Figure 3A), which is the natural reservoir of SARSr-CoV [24].

128

However, it is unclear whether the emergence of P384A is due to neutral drift or positive

129

selection in bats or other species. In addition, given that residue 384 is proximal to the S2

130

domain when the RBD is in the “down” conformation (Figure 3B), whether P384A can

131

modulate the conformational dynamics of the “up and down” configurations of the RBD in

132

the S trimer and influence the viral replication fitness will require additional studies.

133
134

Crystal structure reveals the impact of P384A in CR3022 binding

135

We further determined the x-ray structure of SARS-CoV RBD in complex with CR3022 to

136

2.7 Å resolution (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figure 1). The

137

overall structure of CR3022 in complex with SARS-CoV RBD is similar to that with SARS-

138

CoV-2 RBD [20] (Cα RMSD of 0.5 Å for 343 residues in the RBD and Fab variable domain,

139

cf. fig. S2A and B of [20]) (Supplementary Figure 2). Nonetheless, the CR3022 elbow

140

angles, which are distant from the antibody-antigen interface, differ in the two structures,

141

as we mutated the elbow region (as described in [25]) of CR3022 to promote crystallization

142

with SARS-CoV RBD. The conserved binding mode of CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and

143

SARS-CoV RBD indicates that the difference in binding affinity of CR3022 between SARS-

144

CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD is only due to a very subtle structural difference.

145
146

To investigate how P384 and A384 lead to differential binding of CR3022, we compared

147

the RBD structures from SARS-CoV and SAR-CoV-2 when bound with CR3022. The

148

RBDs have a Cα RMSD of only 0.6 Å (0.7 Å for CR3022 epitope residues). At residue

149

384, the backbone of SARS-CoV-2 is further from CR3022, as compared to that of SARS-

150

CoV (Figure 4B). This difference in backbone positioning (~1.3 Å shift) affects the

151

interaction of the RBD with CR3022 VH S96, which is encoded by IGHD3-10 gene segment

152

on CDR H3 [18, 20]. While CR3022 VH S96 forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with the

153

T385 side chain in both SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD, it can form a second H-

154

bond with the backbone amide of T385 in SARS-CoV RBD (Figure 4C), but not SARS-

155

CoV-2 RBD (Figure 4D). In addition, CR3022 VH S96 adopts different side-chain rotamers

156

when binding to SARS-CoV-2 and to SARS-CoV. Consequently, VH S96 can make an

157

intramolecular H-bond with VH T31 when CR3022 binds to SARS-CoV RBD (Figure 4C),

158

but not to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4D). In summary, VH S96 forms three H-bonds when

159

CR3022 binds to SARS-CoV RBD, as compared to only one when CR3022 binds to

160

SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This observation indicates why binding of CR3022 to the SARS-CoV

161

RBD is energetically more favorable than to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

162
163

CR3022-bound SARS-CoV S protein exhibits a rare three-up conformation

164

To understand the binding of CR3022 to the RBD in the context of the homotrimeric S

165

protein, we previously proposed a structural model where CR3022 could only access its

166

epitope on the S protein when at least two RBD are in the “up” conformation and the RBD

167

is rotated relative to its unliganded structure [20]. To further evaluate and expand on this

168

model, negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) was performed on CR3022 in complex

169

with a stabilized version of the SARS-CoV homotrimeric S protein (Figure 5A, see

170

Materials and Methods). The 3D nsEM reconstruction revealed that one SARS-CoV S

171

protein could simultaneously bind to three CR3022 Fabs, with all three RBDs in the “up”

172

conformation (Figure 5B). Consistent with the structural model that we previously

173

proposed [20], the CR3022-bound RBD was indeed rotated compared to that in the

174

unliganded S protein [26-28], such that, in this conformation, steric hinderance between

175

CR3022 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) is minimized.

176
177

While our results here demonstrate that CR3022 Fab could form a stable complex with

178

SARS-CoV S protein in a prefusion conformation, a recent study reported that prefusion

179

SARS-CoV-2 S protein fell apart upon binding to CR3022 Fab as indicated by cryo-EM

180

[29]. It should be noted that the three-up conformation is much more rarely observed than

181

the other RBD conformations (all-down, one-up, and two-up) in SARS-CoV by cryo-EM

182

[26-28], or SARS-CoV-2 by cryo-EM [30-32] and cryo-electron tomography [33, 34], and

183

could relate to differences in the stability of S trimers in SARS-CoV versus SARS CoV-2

184

when CR3022 is bound. Further studies will be required to investigate whether such a

185

difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is related to stability differences in the

186

recombinant spike proteins, or to different dynamics of the RBD on the virus or infected

187

cells.

188
189

RBD flexibility and quaternary interactions in CR3022-bound SARS-CoV S protein

190

To address some of these issues, we performed cryo-EM analysis to interrogate the

191

binding of CR3022 to SARS-CoV S protein at higher resolution (Supplementary Figure 3

192

and Supplementary Table 2). Focused 3D classification yielded 4 different structural

193

classes with classes 2 and 4 being nearly identical at the given resolution (Figure 5C and

194

Supplementary Figure 4). Class 3 is the most similar to the model from nsEM, although
8

195

the total particle number for classes 2 and 4 together exceed that for class 3

196

(Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast, class 1 is the least represented. In classes 2 and

197

4, CR3022 also appears to make quaternary contacts with the NTD, as suggested by well-

198

defined density in the CR3022-NTD interface (Figure 5C). The moderate resolution (6 to

199

7 Å) of the reconstructions precludes atomic-level descriptions, but the framework region

200

of the CR3022 light chain in classes 2 and 4 is in close proximity to a loop region in NTD

201

corresponding to residues 106-110. In addition, the constant region of CR3022 appears

202

to contact residue D23 of NTD. Another important observation is that the Fab in class 2

203

and 4 would clash with the adjacent RBD if it were in the “down” conformation. So, for the

204

Fab to exist in this quaternary conformation, the adjacent RBD has to be in the “up”

205

conformation. To evaluate the different dispositions of the RBD in these structures, we

206

compared the cryo-EM structure of an apo form of the SARS-CoV S protein where one

207

RBD is the “up” conformation (PDB 6ACD) [35]. The RBD in classes 1 to 4 are rotated by

208

84.1°, 54.3°, -54.7°, and 53.7°, respectively, relative to the apo one-up conformation (see

209

Materials and Methods). Furthermore, the CR3022-bound RBD in class 2 and 4 is more

210

open than in the apo form (Supplementary Figure 5), demonstrating the rotational flexibility

211

of the RBD. In fact, RBD conformational flexibility has also been noted in an ACE2-bound

212

SARS-CoV S protein. Three different dispositions (1 to 3) of the RBD were observed in

213

ACE2-bound SARS-CoV S protein with RBD tilts relative to horizontal top surface of the

214

S trimer of 51.2°, 73.3° and 111.6° compared to 68.9° for the apo one-up structure [35].

215

Our classes 2 and 4 appear to be somewhat intermediate between dispositions 2 and 3

216

(Supplementary Figure 6), whereas the other classes differ from the RBD dispositions in

217

the ACE2-bound SARS-CoV S structures. However, despite the flexibility of CR3022-

218

bound RBD, bivalent binding of CR3022 to S protein does not seem to occur on the virus

219

surface since an IgG avidity effect was not observed in the neutralization assay (see

220

above, Figure 2). Overall, these structural analyses indicate that RBD rotational flexibility

221

and acquisition of quaternary interactions can play an important role in CR3022 interaction

222

with the S protein. CR3022 adds to the growing list of neutralization antibodies that can

223

utilize quaternary interactions for binding to the S protein [12, 36].

224
225

DISCUSSION

226

While it is now known that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 differ in antigenicity despite

227

relatively high sequence conservation [1, 3, 4, 14], there is a paucity of understanding of

228

the underlying molecular determinants of these antigenic changes and the structural

229

consequences of these differences. Through structural analysis of the CR3022-RBD

230

complex and mutagenesis experiments, we show that a single amino-acid substitution at

231

residue 384 contributes to an important antigenic difference in a highly conserved

232

(neutralizing) epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

233
234

While CR3022 cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2 WT in almost all studies [3, 5, 20, 22], it

235

can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant. The KD of CR3022 Fab to SARS-CoV-2

236

WT RBD is 68 nM, whereas to SARS-CoV-2 P384A RBD is 1 nM (Figure 1B-C), indicating

237

that the affinity threshold for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 to this epitope is in the low nM

238

range. However, despite having a low nM affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A RBD, CR3022

239

only weakly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 P384A with an IC50 of 3.2 μg/ml and SARS-CoV with

240

an IC50 of 5.2 μg/ml. In contrast, antibodies with similar or less Fab binding affinity to other

241

RBD epitopes, such as the receptor binding site, can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 much more

242

efficiently. For example, previously characterized SARS-CoV-2 antibodies CC12.1 and

243

CC12.3, which have a KD to SARS-CoV-2 RBD of 17 nM and 14 nM respectively,

244

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at an IC50 of ~20 ng/ml [3, 37]. Of note, the KD and IC50 of CC12.1

245

and CC12.3 were measured in the same manner as this study. The lack of correlation

246

between affinity and neutralizing activity is therefore not due to the difference in the assays

247

between studies. In fact, a previous study also demonstrated a lack of correlation between

248

RBD binding and neutralization for monoclonal antibodies [3]. Together, these

249

observations suggest that the affinity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by RBD-

250

targeting antibodies may be epitope dependent. The difference in affinity threshold for

251

different epitopes is also likely to be related not only in the ability to block ACE2-binding

252

[3, 38], but also in antibody avidity where bivalent binding can cross-link different RBD

253

domains on the same or different spikes and, hence, substantially enhance binding and

neutralization [23].

255
256

Given the scale of the outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 may persist and circulate in humans for

257

years to come [39]. A number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently under

258

clinical trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/who_table) [40], which offer a potential solution

259

to alleviate the global health and socio-economic devastation bought by SARS-CoV-2.

260

However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can escape vaccine-induced immunity through antigenic

261

drift remains to be determined, although escape mutations to many monoclonal antibodies

262

have been tested in vitro [2]. Identification of the key residues that are responsible for

263

differences in antigenicity among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and possibly other SARS-

264

related viruses, should provide a starting point to understand the potential for antigenic

265

drift in SARS-like coronaviruses. The ongoing efforts in SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery

266

and structural characterization will therefore advance our molecular understanding of

267

antigenic variation in SARS-like CoVs, and consequences for vaccine and therapeutic

268

design, especially to cross-neutralizing epitopes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

297

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV RBD

298

RBD (residues: 306-527) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein (GenBank: ABF65836.1) was

299

fused with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal His6 tag, and cloned into a

300

customized pFastBac vector [41]. Recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the

301

Bac-to-Bac system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting

302

purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used

303

to infect suspension cultures of High Five cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at an MOI of 5

304

to 10. Infected High Five cells were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 110 r.p.m. for 72 h

305

for protein expression. The supernatant was then concentrated using a 10 kDa MW cutoff

306

Centramate cassette (Pall Corporation). SARS-CoV RBD protein was purified by Ni-NTA,

307

followed by size exclusion chromatography, and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl

308

pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl.

309
310

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV spike

311

The SARS-CoV spike construct (Tor2 strain) for recombinant spike protein expression

312

contains the mammalian-codon-optimized gene encoding residues 1-1190 of the spike

313

followed by a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain, a HRV3C cleavage site, 8x-His

314

tag and a Twin-strep tags subcloned into the eukaryotic-expression vector pαH. Residues

315

at 968 and 969 were replaced by prolines for generating stable spike proteins as described

316

previously [28]. The spike plasmid was transfected into FreeStyle 293F cells and cultures

317

were harvested at 6-day post-transfection. Proteins were purified from the supernatants

318

on His-Complete columns using a 250 mM imidazole elution buffer. The elution was buffer

319

exchanged to Tris-NaCl buffer (25 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) before further

320

purification using Superose 6 increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions

321

corresponding to the trimeric spike proteins were collected and concentrated.

323

Expression and purification of CR3022 Fab

324

The CR3022 Fab heavy (GenBank: DQ168569.1) and light (GenBank: DQ168570.1)

325

chains were cloned into phCMV3. The plasmids were transiently co-transfected into

326

Expi293F cells at a ratio of 2:1 (HC:LC) using ExpiFectamine™ 293 Reagent (Thermo

327

Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was

328

collected at 7 days post-transfection. The Fab was purified with a CaptureSelect™ CH1-

329

XL Pre-packed Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by size exclusion

330

chromatography. For crystallization, a VSRRLP variant of the elbow region was used to

331

reduce the conformational flexibility between the constant and variable domains [25].

332
333

Crystallization and structural determination

334

Purified CR3022 Fab with a VSRRLP modification in the elbow region and SARS-CoV

335

RBD were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 and incubated overnight at 4°C. The complex (7.5

336

mg/ml) was screened for crystallization using the 384 conditions of the JCSG Core Suite

337

(Qiagen) on our custom-designed robotic CrystalMation system (Rigaku) at Scripps

338

Research by the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops containing 0.1 μl of protein and

339

0.1 μl of reservoir solution. Optimized crystals were then grown in 2 M sodium chloride

340

and 10% PEG 6000 at 4°C. Crystals were grown for 7 days and then flash cooled in liquid

341

nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at Stanford

342

Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 12-2 with a wavelength of 1.033 Å,

343

and processed with HKL2000 [42]. Structures were solved by molecular replacement

344

using PHASER [43] with PDB 6W41 for CR3022 Fab [20] and PDB 2AJF for SARS-CoV

345

RBD [44]. Iterative model building and refinement were carried out in COOT [45] and

346

PHENIX [46], respectively. Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MolProbity

347

[47].

349

Negative-stain electron microscopy

350

Six molar excess of CR3022 Fab (unmodified) was added to SARS-CoV spike protein 1

351

hour prior to direct deposition onto carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids. The grids were

352

stained with 2 % (w/v) uranyl-formate for 90 seconds immediately following sample

353

application. Grids were imaged on Tecnai T12 Spirit at 120 keV with a 4k x 4k Eagle CCD.

354

Micrographs were collected using Leginon [48] and images were transferred to Appion

355

[49] for particle picking using a difference-of-Gaussians picker (DoG-picker) [50] and

356

generation of particle stacks. Particle stacks were further transferred to Relion [51] for 2D

357

classification followed by 3D classification to select good classes. Select 3D classes were

358

auto-refined on Relion and used for making figures using UCSF Chimera [52].

359
360

Cryo-EM sample preparation

361

SARS-CoV spike protein was incubated with six molar excess of CR3022 Fab for 2 h. 3.5

362

µL of the complex (0.9 mg/ml) was mixed with 0.5 µL of 0.04 mM lauryl maltose neopentyl

363

glycol (LMNG) solution immediately before sample deposition onto a 1.2/1.3 300-Gold grid

364

(EMS). The grids were plasma cleaned for 7 seconds using a Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma

365

system prior to sample deposition. Following sample application, grids were blotted for 3

366

seconds before being vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher).

367
368

Cryo-EM data collection and processing

369

Data collection was performed using a Talos Arctica TEM at 200 kV with a Gatan K2

370

Summit detector at a magnification of 36,000x, resulting in a 1.15 Å pixel size. Total

371

exposure was split into 250 ms frames with a total cumulative dose of ∼50 e-/Å2.

372

Micrographs were collected through Leginon software at a nominal defocus range of -0.4

373

µm to -1.6 µm and MotionCor2 was used for alignment and dose weighting of the frames

374

[48, 53]. Micrographs were transferred to CryoSPARC 2.9 for further processing [54]. CTF

375

estimations were performed using GCTF and micrographs were selected using the Curate

376

Exposures tool in CryoSPARC based on their CTF resolution estimates (cutoff 5 Å) for

377

downstream particle picking, extraction and iterative rounds of 2D classification and

378

selection [55]. Particles selected from 2D classes were transferred to Relion 3.1 for direct

379

C3 refinement, symmetry expansion of particles and iterative rounds of 3D focused

380

classification using spherical masks around the RBD and Fab [51]. Final subsets of clean

381

particles from 4 different classes were each refined with C1 symmetry. Figures were

382

generated using UCSF Chimera and UCSF Chimera X [52].

383
384

Calculation of rotation angles

385

Comparisons of subunit rotation angles among different structures were performed with a

386

software ‘Superpose’ in the CCP4 package [56, 57]. For each classified conformation, the

387

Cα atoms of the RBD domain are superimposed to the equivalent atoms of the RBD in

388

“up”-conformation in a previously reported spike trimer cryoEM structure (PDB 6ACD) [35].

389

The rotation matrices generated by superposing each pair of structures with ‘Superpose’

390

were adopted to calculate the subunit rotation angle following the equation shown as

391

below:

392

𝜃 = cos !"

𝑋"" + 𝑌## + 𝑍$$ − 1
2

393

where θ is the subunit rotation angle, X11, Y22, and Z33 represent the X11, Y22, and Z33

394

values in the rotation matrix calculated for the superpose.

395
396

Biolayer interferometry binding assay

397

Binding assays were performed by biolayer interferometry (BLI) using an Octet Red

398

instrument (FortéBio) as described previously [58]. Briefly, His6-tagged SARS-CoV RBD

399

proteins at 20 to 100 μg/ml in 1x kinetics buffer (1x PBS, pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA and 0.002%

400

Tween 20) were loaded onto Anti-Penta-HIS (HIS1K) biosensors and incubated with the

401

indicated concentrations of CR3022 Fab. The assay consisted of five steps: 1) baseline:

402

60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 2) loading: 300 s with His6-tagged S or RBD proteins; 3)

403

baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 4) association: 120 s with samples (Fab or IgG); and

404

5) dissociation: 120 s with 1x kinetics buffer. For estimating the exact KD, a 1:1 binding

405

model was used.

406
407

Pseudovirus neutralization assay

408

Pseudovirus preparation and assay were performed as previously described [3]. Briefly,

409

MLV-gag/pol and MLV-CMV plasmids was co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with

410

full-length or P384A SARS-CoV-2 spike plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 to produce

411

pseudoviruses competent for single-round infection. The supernatant containing MLV-

412

pseudotyped viral particles was collected at 48 hours post transfection, aliquoted and

413

frozen at -80°C until used. For each well in a 96-well half-area plate, 25 μl of virus was

414

immediately mixed with 25 μl of serially diluted IgG or Fab, and incubated for 1 hour at

415

37°C. For each well, 10,000 HeLa-hACE2 cells in 50 μl of media supplemented with 20

416

μg/ml dextran were added to the antibody-virus mixture. The 96-well half-area plate was

417

then incubated at 37°C. At 42 to 48 hours post-infection, HeLa-hACE2 cells were lysed

418

using 1x luciferase lysis buffer (25 mM Gly-Gly pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, and

419

1% Triton X-100). Luciferase intensity was then measured using Bright-Glo Luciferase

420

Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Percentage of

421

neutralization was calculated using the following equation:

Figure 1. A single P384A substitution increases CR3022 affinity to the SARS-CoV-2

665

RBD. (A) Epitope residues on SARS-CoV RBD are colored in cyan and green. The

666

CR3022 CDR loops that contact the RBD are shown and labeled. Cyan: epitope residues

667

that are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Green: epitope residues that

668

are not conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Orange: CR3022 heavy chain.

669

Yellow: CR3022 light chain. (B-C) Binding of CR3022 Fab to (B) wild-type (WT) SARS-

670

CoV-2 RBD and (C) different mutants was measured by biolayer interferometry with RBD

671

loaded on the biosensor and Fab in solution. Y-axis represents the response. Dissociation

672

constants (KD) for the Fab were obtained using a 1:1 binding model, respectively, which

673

is represented by the red curves. Representative results of two replicates for each

674

experiment are shown. Of note, mammalian cell-expressed RBD was used in the binding

675

experiments in this study, whereas insect cell-expressed RBD was used in our previous

676

study [20]. This difference may explain the slight discrepancy in the KD of CR3022 Fab to

677

SARS-CoV-2 RBD WT between this study and our previous study [20].

705

glycoprotein complexed with three CR3022 Fabs. (B) Side and top view of the 3D

706

reconstruction showing CR3022 Fabs bound to all 3 RBDs on the SARS-CoV spike. The

707

SARS-CoV RBD-CR3022 complex from the crystal structure is fitted into the nsEM density

708

with the RBD shown in pink and CR3022 Fab in blue. (C) Side views of the B-factor-

709

sharpened cryo-EM maps (transparent gray surface representation) representing three

710

different classes of SARS spike with CR3022 Fab with different RBD-Fab orientations.

711

While four different classes were identified, only three classes are shown here because

712

classes 2 and 4 are very similar (Supplementary Figure 4). The RBD-Fab complex model

713

is fit into the densities with the RBDs shown in pink and CR3022 Fabs represented in blue.

714

The atomic model of the apo SARS-CoV spike (PDB 6ACD) [35] is also fit into density

715

with one RBD removed for clarity. The protomers are colored in purple, magenta and deep

716

magenta. (D) Top view of the class 2 cryo-EM map depicting potential quaternary contacts

717

between the RBD-bound Fab and the spike NTD in this conformation. In this RBD-Fab

718

conformation, the Fab would clash with the “down” RBD of the adjacent protomer

719

(magenta) and, therefore, the adjacent RBD can only exist in an “up” conformation. (E) A

720

close-up view of the Fab-spike interface showing the superimposition of CR3022 Fab and

721

adjacent RBD. The residues that can contribute to quaternary interactions between

722

CR3022 light chain and the NTD in two of the four classes (2 and 4) are shown.
