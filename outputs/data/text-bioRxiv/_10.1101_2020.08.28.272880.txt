Abstract

19

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent

20

of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that has claimed over 700,000

21

human lives. The only SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, for emergency use, is remdesivir,

22

targeting the viral polymerase complex. PF-00835231 is a pre-clinical lead compound

23

with an alternate target, the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). Here, we perform

24

a comparative analysis of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in A549+ACE2 cells, using

25

isolates of two major SARS-CoV-2 clades. PF-00835231 is antiviral for both clades,

26

and, in this assay, statistically more potent than remdesivir. A time-of-drug-addition

27

approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps and validates PF-

28

00835231’s time of action. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-

29

CoV-2 in human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro

30

evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2,

31

addresses concerns from non-human in vitro models, and supports further studies with

32

this compound.

Introduction

35

In December 2019, multiple cases of severe pneumonia with unexplained etiology were

36

reported in Wuhan, China1. The infectious agent was identified as a novel member of

37

the family Coronaviridae1, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

38

(SARS-CoV-2)2, and the disease it is causing was named Coronavirus Disease 2019

39

(COVID-19), which has since spread globally. At the time of writing, there are 751,910

40

deaths among 20,739,537 confirmed cases in 188 countries3. The only directly-acting

41

antiviral drug, with emergency use authorization, to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections is

42

remdesivir, a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into viral RNA by the viral

43

polymerase, resulting in chain termination4. It remains a strategic priority to increase our

44

arsenal of effective antiviral SARS-CoV-2 drugs by developing novel compounds with

45

minimal side effects and alternate viral targets.

46

One such alternate SARS-CoV-2 target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), which plays

47

an essential role in the viral life cycle: Upon entry and uncoating of the viral particles,

48

the positive stranded RNA genome is rapidly translated into two polyproteins which are

49

subsequently processed into functional proteins by PL2pro and 3CLpro viral proteases5.

50

3CLpro is the main protease and is responsible for releasing 11 of the 13 individual

51

proteins, including the polymerase subunits, enabling their proper folding and assembly

52

into the active polymerase complex6. Thus, blocking 3CLpro activity would effectively

53

shut down the life cycle before viral transcription or replication can occur, making it an

54

enticing target for intervention7. In addition, 3CLpro has a unique substrate preference

55

(Leu-Gln ↓ {Ser, Ala, Gly}), a preference not shared by any known human protease,

56

implying the potential for high selectivity and low side effects of 3CLpro-targeting drugs8.

57

Although there have been intense efforts to develop 3CLpro inhibitors specific for SARS-

58

CoV-27–13, no such compounds have yet been approved.

59

In response to a previous epidemic coronavirus in 2003, PF-00835231 was initially

60

designed as an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro protease10, but, with disease

61

declining, clinical studies were not practical and, consequently, PF-00835231 was never

62

tested clinically. Because 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 96% identical at

63

the amino acid level, including 100% identity within the catalytic pocket8, PF-00835231

64

may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as well. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, limited evolution

65

had been observed. The two major lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating globally as of

66

time of writing are represented by the Wuhan basal clade and the spike protein D614G

67

clade, also referred to as clades A and B, respectively14. Compared to clade A, clade B

68

isolates carry a mutation in ORF S, encoding the spike protein, which results in amino

69

acid substitution D614G. D614G is frequently accompanied by an additional mutation in

70

ORF 1b, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase complex (RdRp),

71

resulting in substitution P323L in NSP1215. Clade B viruses are more prevalent globally,

72

but whether this is due to a founder effect or due to functional differences remains to be

73

determined16. Here, we aimed to characterize the antiviral potency and cytotoxicity

74

profile of PF-00835231 in comparison to remdesivir, in a human type II alveolar

75

epithelial cell line, using clinical isolates representing the two major clades, SARS-CoV-

76

2 USA-WA1/2020 and USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 (D614G), as well as in polarized human

77

airway epithelial cultures (SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020). Our in vitro studies identify

78

PF-00835231 as a compound with better potency than other SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro

79

inhibitors described to date and similar or better potency than remdesivir.

Results

81

Establishing A549+ACE2 cells as a tool to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection and

82

cytopathic effect by high-content microscopy. The human adenocarcinomic alveolar

83

epithelial cell line A549 is a workhorse cell line in the study of respiratory viruses.

84

However, A549 cells are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they do not highly

85

express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE217. To make A549 cells amenable for

86

experiments with SARS-CoV-2, we generated a stable A549 cell line expressing ACE2

87

exogenously. We confirmed elevated levels of ACE2 mRNA in A549+ACE2 cells by RT-

88

qPCR, and of ACE2 protein by Western blot, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy

89

(Fig. S1a-e). To determine permissiveness, we infected A549 or A549+ACE2 cells with a

90

serial dilution of SARS-CoV-2, in a 96-well format, for 24 or 48 h. Using

91

immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) and high-

92

content microscopy, we found A549+ACE2 cells permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

93

whereas parent A549 cells were not (Fig. S1f). Additionally, in A549+ACE2 cells, the

94

percentage of infected cells increased over time, suggesting de novo virus production

95

and spread (Fig. S1g). Finally, we observed that the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by

96

SARS-CoV-2 on A549+ACE2 cells manifests in syncytia formation, in which the nuclei

97

form a ring-like structure (Fig. S1h), similar to what has been described for other

98

coronaviruses18,19. Altogether, our data establish A549+ACE2 cells as a tool to study

99

SARS-CoV-2 infection, spread, and cytopathic effect.

112

In A549+ACE2 cells, PF-00835231 potently inhibits clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates

113

from the two major clades. PF-00835231 is a pre-clinical small molecule inhibitor of

114

the SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro)10. To determine whether PF-00835231 inhibits

115

SARS-CoV-2 in A549+ACE2 cells, we performed antiviral activity and cytotoxicity assays.

116

We challenged A549+ACE2 cells with the clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020,

117

which falls into SARS-CoV-2 clade A (GenBank accession no. MT233526). We

118

measured virus antigen (N) expression by high-content microscopy in cells exposed to a

119

range of drug doses at 24 or 48 hours post infection (hpi, Fig. 1a). In parallel, we

120

determined cellular viability by measuring ATP levels in drug-treated, but uninfected

121

cells. Remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an average 50% effective concentration

122

(EC50) of 0.442 µM at 24 h, and 0.238 µM at 48 h, with no significant cytotoxicity (Fig.

123

1b, d). In comparison, PF-00835231 was statistically more potent than remdesivir, with

124

an EC50 of 0.221 µM at 24 h (p=0.0017 vs remdesivir), and 0.158 µM at 48 h (p=0.036

125

vs remdesivir), and showed no detectable cytotoxicity (CC50 > 10 µM; Fig. 1c, d).

126

To determine the efficacy of PF-00835231 against a SARS-CoV-2 clade B

127

representative, we tested clinical isolate USA/NYU-VC-003/2020, which we had isolated

128

in March 2020 (GenBank accession no. MT703677). USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 carries

129

both of the signature clade B amino acid changes, S D614G and NSP12 P323L. PF-

130

00835231 potently inhibited USA/NYU-VC-003/2020 in A549+ACE2 cells, with an EC50 of

131

0.184 µM (CC50 >10 µM), whereas remdesivir was inhibitory with an EC50 of 0.283 µM

132

(p=0.028 vs. PF-00835231, CC50 >10 µM; Fig. 1 e-g). Thus, while PF-00835231 had

133

similar antiviral activities against representative isolates of both major SARS-CoV-2

134

lineages in this assay, remdesivir exhibited statistically significant weaker antiviral

135

activity against the clade A isolate compared to the clade B isolate (p<0.05).

136

Finally, we analyzed microscopy data for inhibition of the CPE that leads to ring-shaped

137

syncytia formation. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir decreased the overall number of

138

infected foci, and fully protected A549+ACE2 cells from ring syncytia formation, at 0.33 µM

139

and above (Fig. 1h). Collectively, we show that, in this assay, PF-00835231 inhibits

140

isolates from both major SARS-CoV-2 lineages at similar or better effective

169

cells, we performed time-of-drug-addition experiments23. This approach determines how

170

long the addition of a drug can be delayed before the drug loses antiviral activity. Using

171

one-hour-increments (from 1 h prior to 4 h post infection), we varied the time-of-drug-

172

addition for a monoclonal neutralizing antibody (a control targeting the attachment step

173

in the viral life cycle), the drug GC-376 (a control drug for 3CLpro inhibition, licensed for

174

veterinary use in feline coronavirus infections24, and recently shown to inhibit SARS-

175

CoV-212), PF-00835231, and remdesivir. We measured the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-

176

infected cells via high-content microscopy at 12 h post-infection, which corresponds to

177

one replication cycle in A549+ACE2 cells, as determined previously. We synchronized

178

infection using a preincubation step at 4°C, followed by a transition to 37°C at 1 h post-

179

addition of virus, and used the minimum treatment doses for each drug that led to

180

undetectable infection levels – 3 µM for PF-00835231 and the neutralizing antibody, and

181

10 µM for remdesivir and GC-376. The neutralizing antibody lost its antiviral function

182

first, starting at the first addition point post-infection (1 h), confirming blockage of

183

attachment and entry as the mode of antiviral action (Fig. 2). Interestingly, all three

184

treatments, GC-376, PF-00835231, and remdesivir lost antiviral action at the same time

185

of addition, starting at 2 hpi, and with more pronounced loss of activity at 3 and 4 hpi

186

(Fig. 2). This suggests that both polyprotein processing and the start of viral

187

transcription / translation follow each other very closely in time. These time-of-drug-

188

addition experiments confirm the timing of PF-00835231 antiviral action as consistent

189

with its role as a 3CLpro inhibitor, and delineate the timing of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle

190

events in the tissue culture model of A549+ACE2 cells. Furthermore, these experiments

191

demonstrate that polymerase and protease inhibitors such as PF-00835231 can

PF-00835231 is well-tolerated in polarized human airway epithelial cultures

205

(HAEC). The human respiratory tract is a major entry portal for viruses, including SARS-

206

CoV-2, and the first battle between host and virus occurs in cells of the respiratory

207

epithelium. This specialized tissue contains four major cell types (basal, secretory club,

208

goblet, and ciliated) which are organized in a characteristic polarized architecture.

209

Human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC) recapitulate much of the complexity and

210

architecture of this tissue (Fig. 3 a,b), and thus make it arguably one of the most

211

physiologically relevant human tools with which we study respiratory pathogens in vitro.

212

HAEC are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infections and were utilized to obtain the very first

213

SARS-CoV-2 isolate in December 20191.

214

To establish the use of PF-00835231 in HAEC, we first determined its cytotoxicity profile

215

and compared it to that of remdesivir. We added PF-00835231 or remdesivir to HAEC

216

basolaterally (Fig. 3a), and determined tissue morphology by histology, expression of

217

apoptosis markers by RT-qPCR, and disruption of the epithelial layer by measuring

218

trans-epithelial resistance (TEER; Fig. S2a-d). Neither drug caused measurable

219

adverse effects on the morphology of the cultures (Fig. S2a,b) or triggered expression

220

of apoptosis markers (Fig. S2c). However, remdesivir, more so than PF-00835231,

221

negatively impacted trans-epithelial resistance over time (albeit not statistically

222

significantly), suggesting that PF-00835231 may be better-tolerated by HAEC than

223

remdesivir (Fig. S2d).

224

To complement these data from differentiated HAEC with a more standardized assay,

225

we treated a monolayer of basal-like undifferentiated precursor cells with a dose range

226

of PF-00835231 or remdesivir for 48 hours, and quantified ATP as a measure of cell

227

viability, similar to previous experiments with A549+ACE2 cells. We did not detect a

228

decrease in ATP upon PF-00835231 treatment, even at the highest amount of drug (10

229

µM) tested. In contrast, 10 µM of remdesivir caused a dose-dependent reduction in ATP

230

levels, albeit not statistically significantly (Fig. S2e). These experiments demonstrate

231

that PF-00835231 has a favorable cytotoxicity profile in our model of the polarized

232

human airway epithelium.

In HAEC, PF-00835231 exhibits potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 activity.

245

To determine PF-00835231’s anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in HAEC, we added either

246

0.025, 0.5 or 10 µM PF-00835231 or remdesivir, or DMSO carrier control, to the

247

basolateral chamber of HAEC (Fig. 3a). We then challenged HAEC apically with SARS-

248

CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 (Fig. 3a), and determined viral infectious titers from apical

249

washes collected at 12-hour increments. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently

250

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 titers in a dose-dependent manner, with the 10 µM dose resulting

251

in viral titers below the limit of detection (Fig. 3c,d).

To visualize SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAEC during drug treatment, we fixed infected

267

HAEC at the 72 h endpoint and stained them for SARS-CoV-2-N-expressing cells (Fig.

3e). In carrier control cultures, we observed robust infection. Upon treatment with 10 µM

269

PF-00835231 or remdesivir, we found in both cases the number of infected cells

significantly reduced. Taken together, both remdesivir and PF-00835231 potently inhibit

SARS-CoV-2 infection in our model of the polarized human airway epithelium.

Inhibiting the multi-drug transporter MDR1 does not increase efficacy of PF-

00835231 in vitro. Previously, a hurdle in accurately determining PF-00835231’s in

275

vitro efficacy was the action of the multi-drug transporter MDR1 (also known as P-

276

Glycoprotein, encoded by MDR1 / ABCB1) in Vero E6 cells10. Vero E6 cells express

277

high levels of the transporter. MDR1 efficiently exports PF-00835231, thereby reducing

278

intracellular PF-00835231 levels, resulting in an under-representation of the true

antiviral activity of the compound in these cells. To determine a potential role of MDR1

transporter in our in vitro human airway models, we measured PF-00835231 anti-

SARS-CoV-2 activity in the presence or absence of MDR1-inhibitor CP-100356. We

282

observed no statistically significant changes in antiviral activity when blocking MDR1

model systems. Our findings highlight the importance of using appropriate in vitro model

systems in order to characterize antiviral drugs.

Discussion

297

The current public health emergency caused by COVID-19 has illustrated our dire need

298

for vaccines and therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2. In theory, each step of the

299

SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is a potential target for antiviral intervention by small molecule

300

inhibitors9. However, at the time of writing, the only antiviral drug authorized and

301

recommended for emergency use in COVID-19 is remdesivir. Here, we report the potent

302

antiviral activity of the protease inhibitor PF-00835231 against SARS-CoV-2 in human

303

lung epithelial cells and a model of polarized human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC).

304

We show that PF-00835231 has significantly better potency than remdesivir in our

305

A549+ACE2 cell assay, whereas in human airway epithelial cultures, we find both

306

remdesivir and PF-00835231 similarly potent. How the potencies of either drug may

307

relate to differences in treatment effectiveness in vivo is yet to be determined. We also

308

demonstrate that PF-00835231’s antiviral activity holds for viral isolates from different

309

lineages of SARS-CoV-2.

310

The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex is the target of the majority of small molecule

311

inhibitors in multiple stages of development for COVID-19, including remdesivir20,

312

favipiravir25, and ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine26. In contrast to those compounds, PF-

313

00835231 blocks the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protease10. The existence of a drug with an

314

alternate target has important implications regarding the potential selection and

315

management of drug resistant viral variants. First, treatment of both chronic and acute

316

viral diseases have taught us that blocking multiple targets in combination therapy

317

significantly decreases the likelihood for selection of viral resistance mutants27–29.

318

Second, upon failure of monotherapy, it is preferable to switch to an antiviral with a

319

different target to avoid cross-resistance27–29. For both scenarios, combination therapy

320

or switching, PF-00835231 might provide an option. In coronaviruses, the genetic

321

barrier to remdesivir or ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine is high, as mutations conferring

322

resistance significantly reduce viral fitness, and cross-resistance between remdesivir or

323

ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine has not been documented22,26. However, the development of a

324

diverse toolbox of antiviral drugs with different targets to combat SARS-CoV-2 is

325

important to further understand and control this disease.

326

The optimal window of opportunity for starting a successful antiviral drug regimen during

327

acute viral infections, such as influenza, is the first few days post symptom onset, while

328

viral replication is actively ongoing30. For most COVID-19 patients, this window is likely

329

limited to the first week of symptoms31. Such early treatment with remdesivir is impeded

330

by its need for intravenous (IV) administration, requiring a healthcare facility setting,

331

though it still demonstrated benefit for 68% of patients with more advanced infection in

332

randomized clinical studies32. PF-00835231 is also a potential IV treatment. However,

333

the time of active SARS-CoV-2 replication might be prolonged in the most severe

334

patients, as suggested by the aforementioned clinical data32. Thus, the usefulness of a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.272880; this version posted August 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

335

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral regimen even at later times of infection further supports the

336

investigation of therapeutic efficacy of coronavirus specific 3CLpro protease inhibitors for

337

the treatment of COVID-19.

338

Early in the pandemic, protease inhibitors approved for other viruses were tested off-

339

label in COVID-19 treatment, albeit with limited success33. This failure highlighted the

340

need for novel compounds specific to the protease of coronaviruses. A number of

341

compounds have since been identified and characterized in in vitro assays, including

342

the cancer drug carmofur (1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil)13, an alpha-ketoamide

343

inhibitor named 13b8, and others, including GC-37634. In cell-based assays, these

344

compounds act at an EC50 in the micromolar range, whereas PF-00835231 inhibits

345

SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 in the nanomolar range. In fact, our direct comparison of GC-

346

376 and PF-00835231 in A549+ACE2 cells (Fig. 2) showed that 10 µM of GC-367 are

347

required to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection completely, whereas the same is achieved

348

with only 3 µM of PF-00835231. These results illustrate the potency of PF-00835231

349

compared to other 3CLpro inhibitors.

350

Spillovers of zoonotic coronaviruses with high pathogenic potential into the human

351

population are not isolated events, as repeatedly illustrated by the emergence of SARS-

352

CoV in 2002, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012,

353

and now SARS-CoV-2 in 201935. To prepare for future pandemics, the development of

354

pan-coronavirus compounds is of strategic importance. This involves choosing viral

355

targets that are highly conserved within the coronavirus family, such as the 3CLpro

356

protease8. Indeed, in vitro inhibition assays with PF-00835231 and purified 3CLpro of

357

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or CoV 229E showed that PF-00835231 inhibits all three at

358

low nanomolar levels10. Work to advance this compound to needed pre-clinical in vivo

359

efficacy studies is currently underway. Together, our promising results in two

360

physiologically relevant human in vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 show efficient antiviral

361

activity, address concerns arising from non-human models like Vero E6 cells, and

362

therefore warrant additional investigations of PF-00835231 as a potential treatment for

363

COVID-19.

Methods

366

Study design. The primary goal of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy and

367

cytotoxicity of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in two human model systems for SARS-

368

CoV-2 infection, A549+ACE2 cells and polarized human airway epithelial cultures.

369

Compound characterization at NYU was done in a blinded manner. If not stated

370

otherwise, all assays were performed in n=3 biological replicates. First, we performed

371

in-depth characterization of A549+ACE2 cells for the study of SARS-CoV-2, using RT-

372

qPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, microscopy, and high-content imaging. Second,

373

we evaluated the in vitro efficacy and cytotoxicity of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in

374

A549+ACE2 cells. We performed antiviral assays with SARS-CoV-2 from the two major

375

clades at two different time points. Third, we performed time-of-drug-addition assays in

376

A549+ACE2 cells to delineate the time of antiviral action for PF-00835231 and remdesivir

377

within the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Fourth, we assessed the in vitro efficacy and

378

cytotoxicity of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in the physiologically relevant model of

379

polarized human airway epithelial cultures. Finally, we determined the role of efflux

380

transporter MDR1 on the antiviral efficacy of PF-00835231. Our studies were intended

In vitro efficacy and cytotoxicity in A549+ACE2 cells. A549+ACE2 cells were seeded into

475

black wall 96-well plates at 70% confluency. The next day, media was removed and

476

replaced with complete media containing compound/carrier two hours prior to infection.

477

Cells were then infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.425, based on Vero E6 titer,

478

at 37°C. 1 hour post virus addition, virus was removed, and media containing

479

compound/carrier was added. At 24 and 48 hours post infection, cells were fixed by

480

submerging in 10% formalin solution for 30-45 min. After fixation cells were washed

481

once with H2O to remove excess formalin. Plates were dried and PBS was added per

482

well before exiting the BSL-3 facility. Fixed cells were permeabilized and stained with

483

mouse monoclonal SARS-CoV anti-N antibody 1C7, which cross-reacts with SARS-

484

CoV-2 N (kind gift of Thomas Moran), goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 647, and DAPI.

485

Plates were scanned on the CellInsight CX7 LZR high-content screening platform. A

486

total of 9 images were collected at 4x magnification to span the entire well. Images were

487

analyzed using HCS Navigator to obtain total number of cells/well (DAPI stained cells)

488

and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (AlexaFluor 647 positive cells). To enable

489

accurate quantification, exposure times for each channel were adjusted to 25% of

490

saturation and cells at the edge of each image were excluded in the analysis. SARS-

491

CoV-2-infected cells were gated to include cells with an average fluorescence intensity

492

greater than 3 standard deviations that of mock infected and carrier treated cells.

For determination of cytotoxicity, A549+ACE2 cells were seeded into opaque white wall

494

96-well plates. The following day, media was removed, replaced with media containing

495

compound/carrier or staurosporine, and incubated for 24 or 48 hours, respectively. At

496

these timepoints, ATP levels were determined by CellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega, cat no.

Time-of-drug-addition experiments. A549+ACE2 cells seeded into black wall 96-well

500

plates and at confluency were treated and infected as followed. At 2.5 hours prior

501

infection cells were pre-treated with complete media containing 1x compound/carrier. In

502

addition, SARS-CoV-2 (2x) was incubated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCov) rabbit

503

polyclonal spike neutralizing antibody (nAB, 2x). Pre-treated cells and virus/neutralizing

504

antibody mix (1x) were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. To synchronize infection, pre-

505

incubated plates and SARS-CoV-2/nAB mix were chilled at 4°C for 30 min and SARS-

506

CoV-2 was diluted on ice in media containing compound/carrier/nAB. Following pre-

507

chilling, virus/compound/carrier/nAB mixtures were added to the cells to allow binding of

508

virus for 1 hour at 4°C. Plates were moved to 37°C to induce virus entry and therefore

509

infection. 1 hour post virus addition, virus was removed, and complete media was

510

added to all wells. Complete media containing 2x compound/carrier/nAB was added to

511

pre-treated cells, cells treated at infection and cells treated at 1 hour post infection. At 2,

512

3 and 4 hours post infection complete media containing compound/carrier/nAb was

513

added to according wells. At 12 hours post infection, samples were fixed, stained with

514

SARS-CoV-2 N, AlexaFluor 647 secondary antibody and DAPI and imaged using

In vitro efficacy and cytotoxicity in human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC). 48

519

hours prior to infection, 2-6 week old HAEC were washed apically twice for 30 min each

520

with pre-warmed PBS containing calcium and magnesium, to remove mucus on the

521

apical surface. 2 hours prior to infection HAEC were pretreated by exchanging the ALI

522

maintenance medium in the basal chamber with fresh medium containing compounds or

523

carrier. Remdesivir and PF-00835231 were used at 10, 0.5 and 0.025 µM, and CP-

524

100356 at 1 µM. 1 hour prior to infection, cultures were washed apically twice for 30 min

525

each with pre-warmed PBS containing calcium and magnesium. Each culture was

526

infected with 1.35E + 05 PFU (Vero E6) per culture for two hours at 37°C. A sample of

527

the inoculum was kept and stored at -80°C for back-titration by plaque assay on Vero

528

E6 cells. For assessment of compound toxicity, additional cultures were washed and

529

pre-treated as the infected cultures. Instead of being infected, these cultures were

530

incubated with PBS containing calcium and magnesium only as Mock treatment. HAEC

531

were incubated with the viral dilution or Mock treatment for 2 hours at 37°C. The

532

inoculum was removed and the cultures were washed three times with pre-warmed PBS

533

containing calcium and magnesium. For each washing step, buffer was added to the

534

apical surface and cultures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min before the buffer was

535

removed. The third wash was collected and stored at -80°C for titration by plaque assay

536

on Vero E6 cells. Infected cultures were incubated for a total of 72 hours at 37°C.

542

were fixed by submerging in 10% formalin solution for 24 hours and washed three times

579

concentration required for a 50% / 90% response (EC50 / EC90) was determined from

580

these data using a 4 parameter logistic model. Curves were fit to a Hill slope of 3 when

581

>3 and the top dose achieved ≥50% effect. Geometric means and 95% confidence
