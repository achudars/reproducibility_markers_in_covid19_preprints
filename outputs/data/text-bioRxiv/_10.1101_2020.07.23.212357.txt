Abstract
A safe and durable vaccine is urgently needed to tackle the COVID19 pandemic that has infected
>15 million people and caused >620,000 deaths worldwide. As with other respiratory pathogens,
the nasal compartment is the first barrier that needs to be breached by the SARS-CoV-2 virus
before dissemination to the lung. Despite progress at remarkable speed, current intramuscular
vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. We
report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that contains the trimeric or monomeric
spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing
antibodies, mucosal IgA responses in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in
the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA- sequencing confirmed the concomitant activation of T and B
cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues
(NALT), confirming its role as an inductive site that can lead to long-lasting immunity. The ability
to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract has can prevent the initial establishment of infection in
individuals and prevent disease transmission across humans.

Introduction
The COVID19 pandemic has made the development of an efficacious and safe vaccine an
urgent priority. Rapid progress in sequencing, protein structure determination, and epitope
mapping with cross-reactive antibodies has illustrated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S
protein) binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1,2. This, in turn, has made the S
protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein prime candidates for vaccine
design to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, DNA/RNA based vaccine candidates encoded for
the S protein have advanced rapidly and are in clinical trials3,4.
Despite this progress, there is considerable uncertainty about the duration of protective
immunity elicited by the current vaccine candidates. While neutralizing antibodies are the desired
immunological target of the current vaccines, and maybe necessary; it is unclear if serum
neutralizing antibodies will be sufficient for sterilizing immunity. Studies have shown that the
antibody protection in COVID-19 convalescent patients can be short-lived and that patients can
become seronegative in as little as four weeks after exposure5-7. There are also reports of the lack
of high levels of neutralizing activity; and in some cohorts, even a lack of detectable neutralizing
antibodies in patient convalescent sera2,8.
Adaptive immunity mediated by T cells can complement humoral immunity or can inhibit
viral replication independent of humoral immunity. Not surprisingly, there are emerging reports
of patients with COVID-19 like symptoms who have detectable T-cell responses without
seroconversion9. This observation complements other studies that support the existence of robust
T cell responses in convalescent patients. Grifoni et al. demonstrated that 100 % of nonhospitalized convalescent patients showed antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, and 70 % of patients
showed antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses10. Weiskopf et al. detected strong Th1 type
responses directed towards the S protein in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU due to
moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 11. Similarly, Braun et al. have
reported CD4+ T-cell responses targeting the S protein in 83% of COVID19 patients and a third of
healthy patients, presumably due to cross-reactivity to other viruses12. Taken together, these data
highlight that vaccines that target both humoral and cellular responses can deliver lasting
protective immunity.
The nose and the upper respiratory tract are the primary routes of entry for inhalation
pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. Not surprisingly, the nasal compartment showed particular
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can serve as the initial reservoir for subsequent seeding
of the virus to the lung13. Consequently, pre-existing immunity within the respiratory tract is highly
desirable to prevent pathogen invasion. Despite the well-recognized role of mucosal immunity,
most vaccines are designed to elicit circulating humoral immunity without necessarily enabling
mucosal immunity. Mucosal vaccination can stimulate both systemic and mucosal immunity and
has the advantage of being a non-invasive procedure suitable for immunization of large
populations. However, mucosal vaccination is hampered by the lack of efficient delivery of the
antigen and the need for appropriate adjuvants that can stimulate a robust immune response
without toxicity. The identification of the cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) and the stimulator of
interferon genes (STING) pathway has enabled the identification and development of STING

agonists (STINGa)14. STINGa function as novel immunostimulatory adjuvants for mucosal vaccines
against respiratory pathogens, including influenza and anthrax, in mice15-17.
In this report, we encapsulated the STINGa, cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine
monophosphate (2′3′-cGAMP or cGAMP) in liposomes17. We used it as the adjuvant for intranasal
vaccination with the trimeric or monomeric versions of the S protein. Our results show that the
candidate vaccine formulation is safe and elicits systemic immunity (neutralizing antibodies),
cellular immunity (spleen and lung), and mucosal immunity (IgA in the nasal compartment and
lung, and IgA secreting cells in the spleen). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first
COVID-19 vaccine candidate that elicits mucosal immunity and supports further translational
studies as an intranasal non-viral candidate that can induce systemic immunity and confers
immunity at the primary site of viral entry.

Results
An efficient and stable liposomal adjuvant containing STINGa
To facilitate efficient priming of the immune system within the respiratory compartment,
we encapsulated the STINGa within negatively charged liposomes (Figure 1A)17. The adjuvant
encapsulated liposomes were prepared using a passive drug loading method by hydrating the
lipid dry films in buffered solutions containing cGAMP as the STINGa. We removed the free
STINGa via ultrafiltration, and the encapsulation efficiency of STINGa was determined to be 35 %
by calibration against a standard curve (Figure S1A). Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that
the mean particle diameter by intensity of STINGa-liposomes was 81 nm, with a polydispersity
index of 0.24, while the the size of blank liposomes was 110 nm (Figure 1B-C). The mean zeta
potential of liposomes was negative both with (-35 mV) and without (-68 mV) encapsulated
STINGa (Figure 1D-E). We tested the stability of the STINGa-liposomes and showed that they were
stable for up to two months at 4 °C, as evidenced by the conservation of particle sizes and the
absence of aggregates (Figure S1B). The surface charge of liposomes was also unaltered (-40 mV)
after this period (Figure S1B). Collectively, these results established that the negatively charged
liposomes had efficiently encapsulated the STINGa and had good stability.
We prepared the vaccine by gently mixing the trimeric S protein (discussed below) with
the STINGa-liposomes suspensions at room temperature to allow the adsorption of the protein
on the liposomes. The adsorbed Trimer-STINGa-liposomes displayed mean particle diameter of
105 nm and mean zeta potential of -29 mV (Figure 1F-G), with a polydispersity index of 0.24,
slightly bigger and less negative than the STINGa-liposomes (81 nm, -35mV). The results
suggested that formulated protein-STINGa-liposomes vaccine exist in a nanoparticulate colloidal
form.
Neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses, and IgA elicited upon vaccination with TrimerSTINGa
We used the recombinant trimeric extracellular domain of the S protein containing
mutations to the Furin cleavage site as the immunogen (Figure 2A). As expected by extensive
glycosylation of the S protein, SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions confirmed that the protein
migrated between 180-250kDa (Figure 2B). Although previous studies have performed extensive
characterization of the lack of toxicity of the adjuvant formulation, we wanted to confirm that the
adjuvant does not cause morbidity, weight loss, or other hyper-inflammatory symptoms17.
Accordingly, we performed an initial pilot experiment with a five BALB/c mice that received a
single intranasal dose of the adjuvant without protein and observed no weight loss or gross
abnormalities over 14 days (Figure S2A and S2B). We next immunized two groups of mice by
intranasal administration with either a combination of the protein and adjuvant (Trimer-STINGa)
or the protein by itself (control). None of the animals showed any clinical symptoms, including
loss of weight (Figure S2C). Seven days (d7) after immunization, 100 % of the mice that received
the Trimer-STINGa seroconverted and robust anti-S IgG levels with mean dilution titers of 1:1,040
were detected (Figure 2C). By day 15 (d15), the serum concentration of the anti-S IgG antibodies
increased, and mean dilution titers of 1:4,400 were detected (Figure 2C). Anti-S IgG was also
detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of all three mice tested (Figure 2D). We
confirmed that the serum anti-S antibodies were neutralizing with a mean 50% inhibitory dose

(ID50) of 1:414 as measured by a GFP-reporter based pseudovirus neutralization assay (SARSCoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-1 pseudotype) [Figure 2E].
Emerging data support a role for T-cell responses to contribute to protection independent
of antibody responses. We evaluated T-cell responses in the immunized mice using a pool of
15mers that target highly conserved regions of the S-protein (Figure S3)18,19. At d15, all five
animals immunized with the Trimer-STINGa showed robust splenic T cell responses with a mean
of 144 IFNγ spots/106 cells (Figure 2F). Collectively these results show that a single intranasal
administration using the Trimer-STINGa elicited robust serum neutralizing antibodies and T-cell
responses.
IgA mediated protection is an essential component of mucosal immunity for respiratory
pathogens. The Trimer-STINGa improved BALF IgA titers at d15 compared to the control group
(Figure 2G). We also evaluated the IgA responses in the antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the
spleen at d15 by ELISPOT assays. The mice immunized with Trimer-STINGa showed an increase in
the number of total IgA secreting and S-specific IgA secreting ASCs compared to the control
group (Figure 2H). Taken together, these results illustrate that intranasal vaccination elicited IgA
responses that are an essential component of mucosal immunity.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirms the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue
(NALT) as an inductive site upon vaccination.
To investigate if intranasal vaccination can support local inductive responses in the nasal
passage, we harvested the NALT from the immunized animals at the time of euthanasia, converted
them into single-cell suspensions, and performed scRNA-seq (Figure 3A and S4). After filtering,
we obtained a total of 1,398 scRNA-seq profiles. By utilizing uniform manifold approximation and
projection (UMAP), we identified the myeloid; NK and T; and B cell subpopulations using
established lineage markers (Figure 3B and S5). >95 % of the scRNA-seq in both control and
Trimer-STINGa groups corresponded to T and B cells, and we performed detailed analyses on
these immune cells.
We identified four B cell clusters: naïve B cells expressing Cd19, Ms4a1 (CD20), Ighm;
germinal center B cells (GC B cells) expressing Cd69, Cd38, Cd83, Cxcr4, Zfp36, Egr1, Erg3, and Irf4;
an intermediate B cell cluster comprising of activated B cells expressing Cd38; and ASC
(plasmablasts) expressing Sec61b, Casp3, and Tram1 but lacking expression of Ms4a1 (CD20)
[Figure 3C-D and S6]20,21. Consistent with the role of the NALT as an inductive but not an effector
site, we detected only a very small subpopulation of IgA (Igha) expressing cells, at least at this
early time point (d15) [Figure S6]. Comparisons of the control and Trimer-STINGa groups showed
a robust increase in the frequency of GC B cells with a concomitant decrease in naïve B cells [Figure
3E]. These results suggested that successful intranasal vaccination promoted activation of B cells
similar to GCs, and we next investigated if T cells within the NALT supported B-cell differentiation.
We identified three clusters within the T cells: one CD8+ T cell subpopulation expressing Cd8a,
and two CD4+ T cell subpopulations (Figure 3F and S7). The CD4+ T cells were classified as naïve
T cells (naïve) expressing Cd4 and Npm1; and T follicular helper like (TFH) expressing Cd69, Il6ra,
Nr4a1 (Nur77), Tcf7 (TCF1), and Lef1, and also the memory markers Cd27 and Cd28 (Figure 3G
and S7)22-24. The prominent difference in the control and the Trimer-STINGa groups was an
increase in the ratio of Tfh/naïve CD4+ T cells (Figure 3H).

Since GC B cells and Tfh cells represented the dominant clusters in the Trimer-STINGa
NALT, we investigated the nature of interactions between these cells in greater detail25. First, we
visualized cell-cell interaction between the different B and T cell clusters in the NALT. We identified
that Tfh cells were the dominant interacting cell type and interacted strongly with the GC B cell
cluster (Figure 3I). At the molecular level, several well-documented receptor-ligand pairs, Cd40Cd40l, Il21r-Il21, Icosl-Icos, and Baffr (Tnfrsf13c)-Baff (Tnfsf13b) were detected reciprocally on the
GC B cells and the Tfh cells within the NALT (Figure 3J). These results showed that upon
immunization with the Trimer-STINGa, the NALT promoted a GC-like T-cell dependent activation
and differentiation of B cells which in turn can lead to long-lasting immunity.
T-cell responses in the lung and IgA responses in the nasal compartment
We wanted to evaluate if the monomeric S protein could also elicit a comprehensive
immune response. We used a monomeric version of the S protein containing mutations to the
Furin binding site and a pair of stabilizing mutations (Lys986Pro and Val987Pro) [Figure 4A and
S7]. SDS-PAGE of the monomeric protein showed a band between 130-180 kDa (Figure 4B). We
immunized four mice with the monomeric S protein and the adjuvant (Monomer-STINGa) and
again confirmed no weight loss in these animals (Figure S8). At d15, 100 % of the animals
seroconverted, and the mean serum concentration of the anti-S IgG antibodies was 1:750 (Figure
4C). We confirmed that the serum anti-S antibodies were neutralizing with a mean ID50 of 1:188
[Figure 4D]. We evaluated T-cell responses with the same pool of immunodominant peptides. At
d15, all four animals immunized with the Monomer-STINGa showed robust splenic T cell
responses with a mean of 100 IFNγ spots/106 cells (Figure 4E).
Animal models have shown that T cells in the lung are necesary for protection against
pulmonary infection by respiratory pathogens26. Accordingly, we evaluated S-protein specific Tcell responses in the lung of the vaccinated animals. T-cell responses in the lung on d15 were
detected at a mean of 206 IFNγ spots/106 cells (Figure 4E). Collectively, these results established
that intranasal administration using the Monomer-STINGa also elicited robust serum neutralizing
antibodies and T-cell responses in both the spleen and the lung.
We finally investigated the antibody responses in the nasal compartment. We detected
total IgA (ELISA) in the nasal wash from two animals. Both these nasal washes also had detectable
anti-S IgA antibodies at a mean concentration of 7 ng/ml (Figure 4F). Consistent with the ability
of the Monomer-STINGa to elicit mucosal immune responses, we also confirmed the detection of
S-specific IgA secreting ASCs in the spleen of these mice (Figure S9). These results established
that vaccination with the Monomer-STINGa elicits systemic immunity, T-cell responses in the lung
and speen, and mucosal IgA responses.

Discussion
Almost all the vaccine candidates that have advanced in the clinical trials of COVID19 are
based on the intramuscular injection of DNA; nanoparticles loaded mRNA or viral vectors3,27. These
methods have shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies in the serum of preclinical models and
humans27-29. A fundamental limitation of all of these approaches is that they are not designed to
elicit mucosal immunity. As prior work with other respiratory pathogens like influenza has shown,
sterilizing immunity to virus re-infection requires adaptive immune responses in the respiratory
tract and the lung17,30,31. In the context of COVID19 existing data supports that initial infection in
the nasal compartment promotes/facilitates subsequent seeding of the virus to the lung13. The
ability of vaccines to thus promote immunity at the mucosal sites and specifically within the nasal
compartment can prevent seeding of the initial reservoir and control human transmission.
Intranasal vaccination is an attractive platform to elicit systemic and mucosal immunity.
The fundamental challenge in intranasal vaccination is the ability to balance safety while ensuring
immunogenicity leading to sterilizing immunity. Intranasal administration of live-attenuated
vaccines in humans is hampered by concerns of safety32 and the use of the adenovirus vectored
vaccines can be hampered by the presence of pre-existing immunity33. Subunit vaccines are
attractive candidates that do not suffer from these drawbacks. However, the ability of subunit
vaccines to elicit potent and sterilizing immune responses is critically dependent on the choice of
appropriate adjuvants.
We demonstrate that STINGa encapsulated in liposomes can function as potent adjuvants.
A single intranasal immunization with protein S and the adjuvant can elicit neutralizing antibodies
in the serum comparable to other vaccine candidates. We established that intranasal vaccination
leads to IgA responses in the lung and directly in the nasal compartment, and we detected B cells
secreting IgA in the spleen. We show using scRNA-seq that the NALT functions as an inductive
site upon intranasal vaccination, leading to co-ordinated activation/differentiation of B and T cells
resembling germinal centers. Moreover, intranasal vaccination also induced S-specific T cell
responses in both the spleen and locally in the lung. Collectively, these results illustrate the
advantages of optimal intranasal immunization. While we demonstrate cellular and humoral
immunity both systemically and locally in the respiratory tract, future studies using appropriate
challenge models in non-human primates are required to establish whether we elicit sterilizing
immunity and to test the durability of our responses longitudinally. However, we note that due to
the severity of the pandemic, most vaccines currently in clinical trials have advanced without
testing in preclinical challenge models. Although we have shown the immunity elicited upon a
single-dose, we can add a booster dose to increase the durability of the responses, if appropriate.
In summary, our study establishes that intranasal spike subunit vaccines with liposomal
STINGa as adjuvants is safe and elicits comprehensive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In the
context of a pandemic, the intranasal vaccine has two compelling advantages. First, the easy
access to the nasal cavity makes intranasal administration non-invasive. It is particularly suited for
mass vaccinations of large cohorts, including elderly patients and children with minimal clinical
infrastructure. Second, from the standpoint of disease control, the ability to control SARS-CoV-2
infection at the first point of entry in the nasal compartment and before spreading to the lung is

a desirable option to halt disease progression in individuals and disease transmission across
populations. We suggest that our promising vaccine candidate supports human testing.

Methods
Lipids and STINGa. We purchased the STINGa, 2′-3’′cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine
monophosphate (cGAMP) from Chemietek (Indianapolis, IN). 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DPPG), and 1,2dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DPPEPEG2000) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol was obtained from
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Preparation of STINGa loaded liposomes and vaccine formulation. The liposomes were
composed of a molar ratio of 10:1:1:1 of DPPC, DPPG, Cholesterol (Chol), and DPPE-PEG2000. To
prepare the liposomes, we mixed the lipids in CHCl3 and CH3OH, and the solution was evaporated
by a vacuum rotary evaporator for approximately 80 min at 45 °C. We dried the resulting lipid thin
film until all organic solvent was evaporated. We hydrated the lipid film by adding a pre-warmed
cGAMP solution (0.3 mg/ml in PBS buffer at pH 7.4). The hydrated lipids were mixed at elevated
temperature 65 °C for an additional 30 min, then subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. We sonicated
the mixture for 60 min using a Brandson Sonicator (40 kHz). The free untrapped cGAMP was
removed by Amicon Ultrafiltration units (MW cut off 10kDa). We washed the cGAMP-liposomes
three times using PBS buffer. The cGAMP concentration in the filtrates was measured by Take3
Micro-Volume absorbance analyzer of Cytation 5 (BioTek) against a calibration curve of cGAMP
at 260 nm. We calculated the final concentration of liposomal encapsulated cGAMP and
encapsulation efficiency by subtracting the concentration of free drug in the filtrate.
We mixed the S protein monomer (4 µg) or the trimer (10 µg) with the STINGa-liposomal
suspensions at room temperature to allow the adsorption of the protein onto the liposomes. The
formulated vaccine was stored at 4 °C and used for up to 2 months. The average particle diameter,
polydispersity index, and zeta potential were characterized by Litesizer 500 (Anton Paar) at room
temperature.
Mice and immunization. All the animal experiments were reviewed and approved by UH IACUC.
Female, 7-9 week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Prior to
immunization, we anesthetized the mice by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. We
immunized the mice intranasally with different formulations: (1) the adjuvant only group was
administrated with liposome-STINGa; (2) the control group was administrated with protein only;
(3) the Trimer-STINGa group was administrated with protein and liposome-STINGa; and (4) the
Monomer-STINGa group was administrated with protein and liposome-STINGa. The monomeric
and trimeric protein was obtained from BEI Resources (VA, USA) and Creative BioMart (NY, USA),
respectively.
Body weight monitoring and sample collection. The body weight of the animals was monitored
every 2-3 days over two weeks after immunization. Sera were collected seven days and 15 days
after post-vaccination for detection of the humoral response. Nasal wash, BALF, NALT, lung, and
spleen were harvested and processed 15 days after the administration, essentially as previously
described34,35. Sera and other biological fluids (with protease inhibitors) were kept at -80 °C for
long-term storage. After dissociation, the splenocytes and lung cells were frozen in FBS+10%
DMSO and stored in the liquid nitrogen vapor phase until further use.

ELISA. Anti-S protein antibody titers in serum or other biological fluids were determined using
ELISA. Briefly, we coated 1 μg/ml spike protein (Sino Biological, PA, USA) onto ELISA plates
(Corning, NY, USA) in PBS overnight at 4 °C or 2 hours at 37 °C. The plate was blocked with
PBS+1%BSA (Fisher Scientific, PA, USA)+0.1%Tween20TM (Sigma-Aldrich, MD, USA) for 2 hours at
room temperature. After washing, we added the samples at different dilutions. We detected the
captured antibodies by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories,
1 in 5,000; PA, USA), anti-mouse IgA (Bethyl Laboratories, 1 in 10,000; TX, USA) and detection
antibody against mouse IgA (1 in 250) from the mouse total IgA ELISA kit from Invitrogen (CA,
USA). The positive control (anti-S IgG) was obtained from Abeomics (CA, USA).
ELISPOT. IFNγ ELISpot assay was performed using Mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT Basic kit (ALP), following
the manufacture’s instructions (Mabtech, VA, USA). Frozen splenocytes or lung cells were thawed
and seeded on the ELISPOT plate (100-300 k cells per well) without further culturing. The
splenocytes were incubated with the spike protein peptide pool at 1.5 μg/ml/peptide (Miltenyi
Biotec, Germany) at 37 °C for 16-18 hours. The ELISPOT plates were read using a ImmunoSpot®
S6 MICRO analyzer.
IgA-secreting cells were detected using Mouse IgG/IgA Double-Color ELISPOT from Immunospot
(OH, USA) following the manufacture’s instruction. For the total IgA-secreting cells in the spleen,
the splenocytes were thawed and seeded to the capture antibody coated ELISPOT plate
immediately. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16-18 hours, followed by the development. For
the anti-S IgA producing cells, thawed splenocytes were cultured in complete media [RPMI-1640
(Corning, NY, USA) +10% FBS (R&D System, MN, USA), 100 μg/ml NormocinTM (InvivoGen, CA,
USA), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES] and B-Poly-STM (1:1000 dilution)
at 4 million cells/ml. The wells were coated with 5 μg/ml of the spike protein (Sino Biological, PA,
USA) overnight at 4 °C. The spleen cells were washed and seeded onto the plate at 37 °C for 1618 hours.
Cell lines and plasmids. 293T cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor human angiotensinconverting enzyme II (ACE2) and plasma membrane-associated type II transmembrane serine
protease, TMPRSS2 (293 T/ACE2-TMPRSS2) were a generous gift from Dr. Siyan Ding (Washington
University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA)36. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The expression
plasmids for SARS-CoV-2 S protein pCAGGS Containing the SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike
Glycoprotein Gene was obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA). Plasmids encoding GFP
expressing Lentiviral vector, helper plasmids pMDLg/pRRE,pRSV-Rev, and VSV-G proteinencoding plasmid pMD2.G were obtained from Addgene (Watertown, MA).
Generation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-expressing reporter virus. To determine the titer of
neutralizing antibodies in the serum of immunized mice, SARS-CoV-2-S pseudotyped lentiviral
system was used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 infection8. Pseudotyped viral (PsV) stocks were
generated by co-transfecting stable ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 expressing 293 T cells with pLVXAcGFP1-C1, pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-Rev and viral envelope protein expression plasmids pCAGGS
containing the SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike Glycoprotein Gene or VSV-G envelope expressing

and stored at −80°C as described previously37,38. The dose titer of PsV was determined by infecting
ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 expressing 293T cells for 48 h and using Celigo imaging system for imaging
and counting virus infected fluorescent cells39. The viral titers were expressed as fluorescent focus
forming units (FFU)/well40,41.
Neutralizing Antibody (Nab) Titration Assay for SARS-CoV-2. For microneutralization assay,
ACE2-TMPRSS2 expressing 293 T cells were cultured overnight in a half area 96-well plate
compatible with Nexcelom Celigo imager at a concentration of 1 ×104 cells per well in 100 µl of
complete media. On the day of the assay, heat-inactivated serum from mice was thawed and
diluted 1:20 to 1:640 in a six point, two-fold series in serum-free DMEM. In a 96 well plate, 50 µl
of diluted serum was mixed with 50 µl of GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing PsV (150300 FFU/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. After 1 h, this mixture of added to ACE2-TMPRSS2
expressing 293 T cells and incubated for 48 h. The infection of target cells was determined by
imaging and counting FFU/well using Celigo imaging system. Each sample was tested in triplicate
wells. SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 rabbit Mab (Clone #007, Sino Biological, Wayne, PA) was used as a
positive control for neutralizing activity and VSV-G expressing PsV was used as a negative control
for the specificity of neutralization function. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) titers of NAbs were
calculated using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism).
NALT Collection and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting. We isolated the NALT from the mice
after euthanasia precisely as described previously34,42. We lysed the red blood cells by incubating
the cells in ACK lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 3 minutes. We
subsequently washed the single-cell suspensions with PBS, resuspended them in PBS + 2% FBS,
and added 50 nM Helix NP Blue (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) detection of live/dead cells. We used
a BD FACSMelody cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) to collect live cells.
Single-Cell Library Preparation and Sequencing. We labeled each group of NALT cells
separately with the Sample-Tags from the BD Mouse Immune Single-Cell Multiplexing Kit (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA), described in “Single Cell Labeling with the BD Single-Cell Multiplexing
Kits” protocol. We then proceeded to library preparation with a mixture of ~6000 cells (3000 cells
from each group). We prepared the whole transcriptome using the BD Rhapsody System following
the BD “mRNA Whole Transcriptome Analysis (WTA) and Sample Tag Library Preparation
Protocol”. We assessed the quality and quantity of the final library by Agilent 4200 TapeStation
system using the Agilent High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA) and a Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay, respectively. We diluted the final
library to 3 nM concentration and used a HiSeq PE150 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to
perform the sequencing.
Quantification and statistical analysis. Analyzing WTA data via Seven Bridges. We uploaded and
analyzed the FASTQ files on Seven Bridges website (Seven Bridges Genomics) by running the “BD
Rhapsody WTA Analysis Pipeline” (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After performing alignment,
filtering, and sample tag detection, we downloaded and used the pipeline’s final outputs,
including the sample tag calls and molecule count information for further analysis in R (version
4.0.1) using Seurat Package (version 3.0)43.
Downstream analysis of WTA data in R. We first used the SAVER Package to recover the gene
expression and provide a reliable quantification of low expressed genes across the data44. By

following the standard processing workflow in Seurat Package, we acquired the clustering and
gene expression data. We removed cells with < 1000 Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and high
mitochondrial gene expression (> 20% of the reads), and we ended up with 1398 single-cell
profiles (660 control, 738 treated) with a mean UMI of 1648.
To analyze the cell-cell communication at the molecular level, we used the recovered molecule
counts by SAVER in CellPhoneDB analysis tool25. First, we transformed the mouse genes to their
human orthologous using BiomaRt Package (version 2.38.0)45. Then, we categorized all T cells and
B cells by their subpopulations and group (control and Trimer-STINGa) into 14 cell types.
According to statistical tests calculated CellPhoneDB, we filtered out the ligand-receptor pairs with
p values > 0.05 and evaluated the relationship between different cell types with the significant
pairs. To generate the network of interactions, we applied igraph Package (version 1.2.5)46.
