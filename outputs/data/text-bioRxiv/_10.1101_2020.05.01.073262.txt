Abstract: In a side-by-side comparison of evolutionary dynamics between the 2019/2020 SARSCoV-2 and the 2003 SARS-CoV, we were surprised to find that SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARSCoV in the late phase of the 2003 epidemic after SARS-CoV had developed several
advantageous adaptations for human transmission. Our observations suggest that by the time
SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission
to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution
stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden
appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should
motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future reemergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if
similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we
analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for
human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood
market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates
and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating
for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify
lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is well adapted for humans. What does this mean for re-emergence?
Several reports have noted that SARS-CoV-2 appears genetically stable and not under much
pressure to adapt, which bodes well for diagnostics, vaccine, and therapeutics development (1–
4). How long a particular antiviral, antibody, or vaccine will be effective against SARS-CoV-2
depends greatly on how fast and how extensively the target gene or protein is evolving. To identify
effective therapies, immense efforts have already been directed towards elucidating the precise
structure of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, ideally, in complex with potential drug candidates - some of
which are already undergoing clinical trials (5–11). Any new SARS-CoV-2 variant that can escape
or confound these highly precise approaches will subvert efforts to control the pandemic.
Therefore, it is very important to ascertain that the SARS-CoV-2 genes targeted in these efforts
have stabilized and to identify novel virulent variants as soon as possible.
To gain a better understanding of how stable the SARS-CoV-2 genome is, we first performed a
side-by-side comparison of evolutionary dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. For
this analysis, we curated high quality genomes spanning ~3-month periods for the following
groups: 11 genomes for early-to-mid epidemic SARS-CoV, 32 genomes for late epidemic SARSCoV, and 46 genomes for SARS-CoV-2 that included an early December, 2019 isolate, WuhanHu-1, and 15 randomly selected genomes from each month of January through March, 2020
sampled from diverse geographical regions (methods in Supplementary Materials). We were
surprised to find that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low genetic diversity in contrast to SARS-CoV, which
harbored considerable genetic diversity in its early-to-mid epidemic phase (Figure 1) (12);
nucleotide diversity estimates (13,14) across all sites, non-synonymous and synonymous, for
each locus examined are provided in the Supplementary Table.
SARS-CoV was observed to adapt under selective pressure that was highest as it crossed from
Himalayan palm civets (intermediate host species) to humans and diminished towards the end of
the epidemic (15–18); this series of adaptations between species and in humans culminated in a
highly infectious SARS-CoV that dominated the late epidemic phase. In comparison, SARS-CoV2 exhibits genetic diversity that is more similar to that of late epidemic SARS-CoV (Figure 1,
Supplementary Table). In fact, the exceedingly high level of identity shared among SARS-CoV2 isolates makes it impractical to model site-wise selection pressure. As more mutations occur
and, ideally, when SARS-CoV-2-like viruses from an intermediate host species are identified, it
will become possible to model selection pressure as was done for SARS-CoV.

An examination of 43 SARS-CoV and 46 SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a striking difference in
the number of substitutions over similar 3-month periods (Figure 1A), with more genetic
polymorphism in early-to-mid epidemic SARS-CoV compared to late epidemic SARS-CoV or
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B). To rule out a subsampling artefact, we performed one hundred
sampling experiments from all high-quality SARS-CoV-2 sequences on GISAID; IQtree
phylogenies were built from the one hundred 46-taxon subsampled sequence sets, i.e., 15
randomly selected samples from each month of January through March, 2020 from diverse
geographical regions, in addition to Wuhan-Hu-1. The maximum tip-to-tip distance (number of
substitutions between two genomes) of the early-to-mid epidemic SARS-CoV tree (~85
substitutions) was greater than that of all one hundred resampled SARS-CoV-2 trees (~15-25
substitutions; p < 0.01). Even by April 28, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID
spanning 4 months exhibited modest genetic diversity (Supplementary Figure 1) as compared
to early-to-mid epidemic SARS-CoV.
A caveat of this analysis is that genetic diversity can be inflated by sampling from diverse or high
traffic locations and be skewed by factors such as effective population size and virus transmission
rate; whereas a sampling bias towards isolates sharing a more recent common ancestor will
underestimate genetic diversity (20–22). For this reason, we sampled within similar 3-month
periods and ensured that there was geographic spread in the sampling. Unfortunately, due to the
scarcity of 2003 SARS-CoV samples and information, we cannot ensure that the early-to-mid
epidemic samples did not straddle deep splits in the tree. Nonetheless, the SARS-CoV genomes
used in our analysis have been used in dozens of studies to examine SARS-CoV adaptive
evolution. The division of SARS-CoV cases into early-to-mid versus late phase epidemiologicallylinked clusters has been validated (17). Furthermore, the late epidemic SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 samples are from more numerous, international locations compared to early-to-mid
epidemic SARS-CoV, which consists of infections only in China. The SARS-CoV outbreak
spanning November, 2002 to August, 2003 was estimated to result in 8,422 cases (23) as
compared to the more than 850,000 known SARS-CoV-2 cases by the end of March (and more
than 3 million cases by the end of April). A considerable portion of SARS-CoV-2 cases are
asymptomatic or mild, leading to an underestimation of the virus population size. Yet, early-tomid epidemic SARS-CoV, which was sampled from a more limited population in a more limited
location, exhibits the most genetic diversity.

We proceeded to compare the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in terms
of the non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN and dS) in each gene. Nonsynonymous substitutions, as compared to synonymous substitutions, are generally more likely
to result in functionally distinct variants. Therefore, dN and dS have commonly been used to model
selective pressure on each gene, and were used to determine that the spike (S), Orf3a, and Orf1a
genes experienced strong selective pressure in the SARS-CoV epidemic (15–17,24). Importantly,
the S protein binds to host receptors and influences host specificity, while the Orf3a-encoded
accessory protein facilitates the endocytosis of S (25,26). Orf3a and S have been proposed to
share a co-evolutionary relationship (27,28). We sampled 50 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from each
month of January, February, and March, 2020 from diverse locations in addition to Wuhan-Hu-1.
For the spike (S), Orf3a, and Orf1a genes, the dN and dS in SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to late
epidemic than early-to-mid epidemic SARS-CoV (Figure 1C, Figure 2). In comparison, the highly
conserved Orf1b (encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp and helicase Hel), which did
not undergo strong positive selection in SARS-CoV (15), exhibits similarly low dN across the three
CoV groups (Figure 1C, Figure 2).
In consideration that several therapies and antibodies in development target the SARS-CoV-2 S,
it is important to track non-synonymous substitutions and predict the evolution of resistance. We
analyzed the non-synonymous substitutions that occurred in the S of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 over the course of each epidemic. Numerous adaptive mutations that evolved in SARS-CoV S
RBD have been experimentally demonstrated to enhance binding to the human ACE2 receptor
and facilitate cross-species transmission, e.g., residues N479 and T487 (29,30), as well as K390,
R426, D429, T431, I455, N473, F483, Q492, Y494, R495 (31); or predicted to have been
positively selected, e.g. residues 239, 244, 311, 479, 778 (17) (Figure 3). In contrast, the majority
of the non-synonymous substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 S are distributed across the gene at low
frequency and have not been reported to confer adaptive benefit (Figure 4). Yet, the SARS-CoV2 S has been demonstrated to bind more strongly to human ACE2 and has a superior plasma
membrane fusion capacity compared to the SARS-CoV S (32,33). The only site of notable entropy
in the SARS-CoV-2 S, D614G, lies outside of the RBD and is not predicted to impact the structure
or function of the protein (34). Its prevalence in international COVID-19 cases has been attributed
to the substitution occurring early in the pandemic leading to a founder’s effect. There is no
evidence of a more virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerging despite passage through more than
3 million human hosts by the time of this analysis.

The pairwise comparisons of dN and dS, alongside a dearth of signs of emerging adaptive
mutations, suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already
well adapted for human transmission to an extent more similar to late epidemic than to early-tomid epidemic SARS-CoV. One possible scenario is that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in late 2019
resulted from a bottleneck event similar to the late epidemic SARS-CoV cases that stemmed from
a single superspreader who visited Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, China in late February, 2003
(36). In comparison to the SARS-CoV epidemic, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic appears to be missing
an early phase during which the virus would be expected to accumulate adaptive mutations for
human transmission. However, if this were the origin story of SARS-CoV-2, there is a surprising
absence of precursors or branches emerging from a less recent, less adapted common ancestor
among humans and animals. In the case of SARS-CoV, the less human-adapted SARS-CoV
progenated multiple branches of evolution in both humans and animals (Figure 1, Figure 5). In
contrast, SARS-CoV-2 appeared without peer in late 2019, suggesting that there was a single
introduction of the human-adapted form of the virus into the human population. This has important
implications regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-emergence in the near future and the severity
of its consequences.
It is important to recall that there were two SARS-CoV outbreaks in 2002-2004, each arising from
separate palm civet-to-human transmission events (Figure 5): the first emerged in late 2002 and
ended in August, 2003; the second arose in late 2003 from a lingering population of SARS-CoV
progenitors in civets. The second outbreak was swiftly suppressed due to diligent human and
animal host tracking, informed by lessons from the first outbreak (37,38). To prevent similar
consecutive outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 today, it is vital to learn from the past and implement
measures to minimize the risk of additional SARS-CoV-2-like precursors adapting to and reemerging among humans. To do so, it is important to identify the route by which SARS-CoV-2
adapted for human transmission. However, there is presently little evidence to definitively support
any particular scenario of SARS-CoV-2 adaptation. Did SARS-CoV-2 transmit across species into
humans and circulate undetected for months prior to late 2019 while accumulating adaptive
mutations? Or was SARS-CoV-2 already well adapted for humans while in bats or an intermediate
species? More importantly, does this pool of human-adapted progenitor viruses still exist in animal
populations? Even the possibility that a non-genetically-engineered precursor could have adapted
to humans while being studied in a laboratory should be considered, regardless of how likely or
unlikely (39).

What is known about possible intermediate hosts and SARS-CoV-2 species tropism?
Speculations that pangolins are the likely intermediate animal host stemmed from the discovery
of a pangolin CoV that shares 95.4% S amino acid identity and six key RBD residues with SARSCoV-2 (40). Since then, another closely related lineage of pangolin CoVs has been identified (41).
However, the unique polybasic furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 S is not found in pangolin
CoVs (42), and SARS-CoV-2 is not a recent recombinant involving any of the CoVs sampled to
date (41,43,44). The CoV that is most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 is RaTG13, a bat CoV that
was identified at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and originally isolated from the Yunnan Province
of China (45). RaTG13 shares 96.2% genome identity with the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate.
In comparison, the most closely related pangolin CoV MP789 shares only 84.1% and 84.0%
genome identity with Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13, respectively. No evidence as yet points to the
adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 for human infection in pangolins or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
from pangolins to humans.
In addition, it is plausible for SARS-CoV-2 S to have evolved its broad species tropism naturally
in bats or a wide range of intermediate species. The SARS-CoV-2 S is predicted to bind to ACE2
from potentially more than 100 diverse species (46–48), and was demonstrated to bind more
strongly than the SARS-CoV S to ACE2 from both bat and human (33). The S of RaTG13 is also
capable of binding to human ACE2 although the virus does not infect humans (49). Similarly, the
S of human MERS-CoV was found to bind to receptors from humans, camels, and bats, and could
adapt to semi-permissive host receptors within three passages in cell culture (50). Therefore,
although no sampled bat CoVs have been found to possess a SARS-CoV-2-like S RBD, these
findings collectively suggest that some CoVs in nature are evolving S that can bind at an optimal
level to the same receptor across diverse species (43), potentially by interfacing with highly
conserved parts of the receptor. As other groups have recommended, CoV sampling from more
species - to avoid bias stemming from the focused scrutiny of Malayan pangolins - will provide us
with a better grasp of the range of species that harbor CoVs with similar RBDs to SARS-CoV-2,
as well as the natural diversity of bat CoVs (43).
There has been considerable debate among scientists and the public on whether SARS-CoV-2
originated from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market (2). According to the Chinese CDC’s website,
accessed on April 27, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples at the Huanan
seafood market, and the Chinese CDC suggested that the virus originated from animals sold there

(51). However, phylogenetic tracking suggests that SARS-CoV-2 had been imported into the
market by humans (52). To look for clues regarding an intermediate animal host, we turned to
samples collected from the market in January, 2020. In contrast to the thorough and swift animal
sampling executed in response to the 2002-2004 SARS-CoV outbreaks to identify intermediate
hosts (37,53), no animal sampling prior to the shut down and sanitization of the market was
reported. Details about the sampling are sparse: 515 out of 585 samples are environmental
samples, and the other 70 were collected from wild animal vendors; it is unclear whether the latter
samples are from animals, humans, and/or the environment. Only 4 of the samples, which were
all environmental samples from the market, have passable coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
for analysis. Even so, these contain ambiguous bases that confound genetic clustering with
human SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Nonetheless, the market samples did not form a separate cluster
from the human SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We compared the market samples to the human WuhanHu-1 isolate, and discovered >99.9% genome identity, even at the S gene that has exhibited
evidence of evolution in previous CoV zoonoses. In the SARS-CoV outbreaks, >99.9% genome
or S identity was only observed among isolates collected within a narrow window of time from
within the same species (Figure 5) (15). The human and civet isolates of the 2003/2004 outbreak,
which were collected most closely in time and at the site of cross-species transmission, shared
only up to 99.79% S identity (Figure 5) (37). It is therefore unlikely for the January market isolates,
which all share 99.9-100% genome and S identity with a December human SARS-CoV-2, to have
originated from an intermediate animal host, particularly if the most recent common ancestor
jumped into humans as early as October, 2019 (54,55). The SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the market
samples were most likely from humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were vendors or visitors
at the market. If intermediate animal hosts were present at the market, no evidence remains in
the genetic samples available.
Conclusion
The lack of definitive evidence to verify or rule out adaptation in an intermediate host species,
humans, or a laboratory, means that we need to take precautions against each scenario to prevent
re-emergence. We would like to advocate for measured and effective approaches to identify any
lingering population(s) of SARS-CoV-2 progenitor virus, particularly if these are similarly adept at
human transmission. The response to the first SARS-CoV outbreak deployed the following
strategies that were key to detecting SARS-CoV adaptation to humans and cross-species
transmission, and could be re-applied in today’s outbreak to swiftly eliminate progenitor pools: (i)

Sampling animals from markets, farms, and wild populations for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses (38).
(ii) Checking human samples banked months before late 2019 for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses or
SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies to detect precursors circulating in humans (56). In addition,
sequencing more SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Wuhan, particularly early isolates if they still exist,
could identify branches originating from a less human-adapted progenitor as was seen in the 2003
SARS-CoV outbreak. It would be curious if no precursors or branches of SARS-CoV-2 evolution
are discovered in humans or animals. (iii) Evaluating the over- or underrepresentation of food
handlers and animal traders among the index cases to determine if SARS-CoV-2 precursors may
have been circulating in the animal trading community (57). While these investigations are
conducted, it would be safer to more extensively limit human activity that leads to frequent or
prolonged contact with wild animals and their habitats.

Supplementary Materials and Methods
Data curation and random sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
We analyzed genome sequences at least 29,000 bases in length of SARS-CoV from the 20022003 outbreak (early-to-mid phase and late phase) and SARS-CoV-2 from the 2019-2020
pandemic. The sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from ViPR (1)
and GISAID (2), respectively. Contributors of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are listed in
our GISAID Acknowledgments file. The sequences from cruise ship patients were excluded.
The sequences from the earliest part of the COVID-19 pandemic (December, 2019 in Wuhan)
were excluded because they were of poor quality (3). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 sequences
were removed from the selection pool if they contained undetermined or ambiguous bases after
the ends were trimmed. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were randomly selected such that the
same number of sequences were taken from each month of collection and, within each month,
the sequences were evenly sampled from each geographic region; the probability of each
particular sequence being sampled was 1/(number of sequences in country X * total number of
countries). Using this sampling strategy, we derived sequence sets that are temporally and
spatially well represented.
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
Multiple sequence alignments were built for the SARS-CoV sequences and SARS-CoV-2
sequences separately using MAFFT version 7.453 (4) with the ‘--auto’ option. Then,
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using IQtree version 1.6.12 (5) with automatic model
selection using ModelFinder (6). The GD01 (GenBank: AY278489) and Wuhan-Hu-1 (GISAID:
EPI_ISL_402125) sequences were used to root the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genome
phylogenies, respectively. The GD01 sequence was obtained from one of the early patients of
the 2003 outbreak and carries the 29-nt Orf8 region found in palm civet hosts of SARS-CoV but
was lost during human-to-human transmission of the virus (7). The Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence is a
high-quality genome sequence from an early patient of the COVID-19 pandemic (8). The
phylogenetic trees were processed and visualized using the R packages ape version 5.3 (9),
adephylo version 1.1-11 (10), and ggtree version 2.0.4 (11).

Estimation of pairwise dN and dS
Nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rate (dN and dS) were estimated under pairwise
maximum-likelihood comparisons (12) using codeml, which is part of the PAML version 4.8
package (13). The SARS-CoV sequence set was split into two sets corresponding to the earlyto-mid phase and the late phase of the 2003 outbreak. Indels were not considered in our
analysis (see Supplementary Discussion on Indels and Orf8 deletion). It is currently impractical
to assess the site-wise selective pressure on SARS-CoV-2 genes due to the low genetic
diversity. In particular, smaller genes are less amenable to dN and dS analysis within short time
frames with limited genetic diversity. Nonetheless, we have plotted additional dN and dS plots in
Supplementary Figures 2-4, but these should be interpreted with caution. Mainly, adding the
most closely related animal CoVs to the analysis did not change our findings and potentially
added a skew in the case of bat CoV RaTG13, which shares only ~96.2% genome identity with
SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Supplementary Figures 2-4).
In Supplementary Figures 2 and 4, the following closely related bat and civet CoVs were
included in the analysis: For SARS-CoV, civet CoVs: SZ16 (AY304488), SZ3 (AY304486),
HC/GZ/32/03 (AY545918), HC/GZ/81/03 (AY545917), HC/SZ/266/03 (AY545916), HC/SZ/79/03
(AY545914), and HC/SZ/DM1/03 (AY545915). For SARS-CoV-2, a bat CoV: RaTG13
(MN996532.1).

Analysis of environmental samples from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan
We found available sequence data for five environmental samples collected on January 1, 2020,
from the Huanan seafood market. Unfortunately, the quality of these samples cannot be
ascertained because the raw sequencing data is not available. Single nucleotide differences or
differences near the ends of fragments could stem from low sequencing quality or coverage. We
compared the environmental sample sequences to the human Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2
genome reference from December, 2019 (8):
Sample EPI_ISL_408511, with sequences totaling 28,557-nt, shared 99.97% genome identity
and 99.97% S gene identity with Wuhan-Hu-1. Sample EPI_ISL_408512, with sequences
totaling 25,342-nt, shared 99.87% genome identity with Wuhan-Hu-1. The fragments covering
3585-nt of the 3822-nt S gene were ~99.9% identical. Sample EPI_ISL_408513 had a 439-nt

sequence from its S gene, which was 100% identical to the Wuhan genome reference. The
other ~600-nt in fragments were visibly low in quality and mapped to Orf1b, a highly conserved
region in SARS-like-CoVs. It was not useful to analyze these low-quality short sequences.
Samples EPI_ISL_408514 and 408515 each had sequences totaling 29,891-nt sharing 99.99%
genome identity and 100% S gene identity with Wuhan-Hu-1. The two samples were 99.99%
identical to each other.
Many of the single nucleotide differences came from ambiguous base calls, for example, R or Y,
in the environmental sample sequences. If these were excluded from our alignments, the
percent identity between the environmental samples and Wuhan-Hu-1 would increase.
However, the lack of access to the raw sequencing data prevents us from assessing the
reliability of the sequence similarities or disparities. There is also no information about what
these environmental samples were derived from, e.g., type of shop (live-animal, meat), species
of animals in that area, type of surface the sample was collected from, or whether COVID-19
human cases frequented that area before the samples were collected on January 1, 2020.
Indels and Orf8 deletion
The SARS-CoV 29-nt deletion or the deletion of Orf8 was found to be detrimental to virus
replication across mammalian cell lines, including primate and human cell lines (14). Muth et al.
postulated that “the 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV is the result of a founder effect that has
permitted survival in spite of reduction of fitness”. In agreement with these findings, the Chinese
SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium found that “Major deletions were observed in the
Orf8 region of the genome, both at the start and the end of the epidemic” (15). In their report,
Muth et al. also discussed the relationship between reduced virulence or replication, prolonged
survival of infected animals, and consequences for viral propagation during an epidemic (14): a
less replication-efficient (possibly asymptomatic) virus may have an advantage when
quarantining measures are in place by hiding and re-emerging after social distancing measures
have been lifted. The impact of deletions in Orf8 is especially important in consideration of the
recent discovery of a 382-nt deletion in Orf8 of SARS-CoV-2 (16). However, in consideration of
the complexity associated with deletions in Orf8 of SARS-CoVs, we opted to exclude the
analysis of indels in our work due to the inability to discern whether these indels could be
perpetuated due to founder effects rather than a true adaptive benefit.

Supplementary Figure 1. Divergence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes rooted with the WuhanHu-1 genome reference. This figure was obtained from NextStrain (17) on April 28, 2020, and
describes the genetic divergence spanning ~4 months between the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
collected in December, 2019, and the genomes collected up to late April.

Supplementary Figure 2. Plots of pairwise dN versus dS for each locus examined. SARSCoV early-to-mid epidemic (11 genomes), late epidemic (32 genomes), and SARS-CoV-2 (46
genomes) are represented in blue (colored circle), orange (cross), and red (empty circle),
respectively. The bat CoV RaTG13 was used in the calculation of dN and dS for SARS-CoV-2;
seven 2003 civet SARS-CoVs were used in the calculation of dN and dS for early-to-mid and
late epidemic SARS-CoV. We did not include pangolin CoV MP789 in the analysis for SARSCoV-2 due to (i) low 84.1% genome identity and only 86.4% nucleotide identity at the S RBD
despite 96.4% amino acid identity, and (ii) stretches of ambiguous sequence that prohibited
locus-specific dN and dS estimations.

Supplementary Figure 3. Pairwise ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution
rate (dN/dS) in the Spike, S RBD, Orf1a, Orf1b, Orf3a, and N. High estimates (>2) were
removed as per common practice. The analysis for SARS-CoV-2 is based on 46 genomes:
Wuhan-Hu-1 and 15 randomly selected genomes from each month of January, February, and
March, 2020. No intermediate animal host CoVs have been identified for SARS-CoV-2. Thus,
single population dN/dS are shown as opposed to inter-species dN/dS in order to keep the
values for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 comparable. The same plots using bat CoV RaTG13
and civet SARS-CoVs are shown in Supplementary Figure 4.

dN/dS calculations were performed using the most closely related animal CoVs: palm civet
SARS-CoVs from 2003 (99.76% genome identity) alongside the human SARS-CoVs, and bat
CoV RaTG13 (96.2% genome identity) alongside the human SARS-CoV-2s.
