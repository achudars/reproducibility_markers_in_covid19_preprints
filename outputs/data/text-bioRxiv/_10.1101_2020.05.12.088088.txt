ABSTRACT
Identification of the full complement of genes in SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial step towards gaining a
fuller understanding of its molecular biology. However, short and/or overlapping genes can be
difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high throughput
experimental approaches – such as ribosome profiling – cannot distinguish translation of functional
peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced
conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV and related viruses (subgenus
Sarbecovirus), and correlating with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and plausible
translation mechanism, we identified a putative new gene, ORF3a*, overlapping ORF3a in an
alternative reading frame. A recently published ribosome profiling study confirmed that ORF3a* is
indeed translated during infection. ORF3a* is conserved across the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and
encodes a 40–41 amino acid predicted transmembrane protein.
INTRODUCTION
The aetiological agent of COVID-19 is the virus SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus in the genus
Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a positivesense RNA genome, around 30,000 nt in size. The 5′ two thirds of the genome contain two long
open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the viral genomic RNA
(gRNA). ORFs 1a and 1b encode the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, where translation of pp1ab
depends on a proportion of ribosomes making a programmed −1 nt ribosomal frameshift near the
end of ORF1a to enter ORF1b. Polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically processed to
produce the viral replication proteins (reviewed in Snijder et al., 2016). The 3′ third of the genome
contains a number of ORFs that encode the viral structural and accessory proteins. These ORFs are
translated from a nested series of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) that are produced during the
infection cycle (reviewed in Sola et al., 2015). In SARS-CoV-2, these ORFs comprise S, 3a, E, M,
6, 7a, 7b, 8, N, 9b and possibly 10 (Fig. 1a). The S, E, M and N ORFs encode respectively the virus
spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins – key components of the virus particle that
are conserved among coronaviruses. ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b encode accessory proteins, also
present in SARS-CoV-1, but less widely conserved across coronaviruses as a whole (reviewed in
Liu et al., 2014). These 3′ ORFs each have a corresponding dedicated sgmRNA except for ORFs 7b,
9b and 10. ORFs 7b and 9b appear to be translated from the ORF7a and N sgmRNAs, respectively,
via a leaky scanning mechanism (Schaecher et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2009) whereas the translation
mechanism for ORF10 is unknown.
There is considerable variability between coronavirus genera and subgenera in the complement of
3′-encoded accessory genes (Liu et al, 2014). Even within the sarbecovirus genus, there are

differences. For example, SARS-CoV-1 has an ORF3b that overlaps the 3′ region of ORF3a but is
absent in SARS-CoV-2. Also, in many human-adapted SARS-CoV-1 isolates, ORF8 is split by a
frame-disrupting deletion (He et al., 2004). ORF10 is apparently translated in SARS-CoV-2 (Finkel
et al., 2020) but is truncated in SARS-CoV-1. Identification of the full complement of genes in
SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial step towards gaining a fuller understanding of its molecular biology, and
may also help guide vaccine or other antiviral strategies. This information also facilitates rational
manipulation of the viral genome (e.g. for developing replicon systems or for mutagenesis studies).
However, short and/or overlapping genes can be particularly difficult to identify using traditional
computational approaches. On the other hand, high throughput experimental techniques such as
ribosome profiling and high resolution mass spectrometry – while powerful – do not necessarily
distinguish between functional proteins, regulatory translation (where it is the act of translation
rather than the encoded product that is biologically relevant), and translational noise.
Comparative genomics offers a way forward: analysis of patterns of substitutions across alignments
of related sequences can be used to reveal the signatures of “hidden” protein-coding genes. Analysis
of synonymous substitution rates provides a particularly sensitive technique for identifying
overlapping functional elements embedded within protein-coding genes, because such elements
constrain synonymous changes which otherwise are selectively more-or-less neutral (Firth, 2014).
When combined with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and the conserved presence
of a plausible translation mechanism, overlapping genes may be distinguishable from overlapping
non-coding elements such as functionally important RNA structures (Jagger et al., 2012; Fang et al.,
2012; Loughran et al., 2012; Lulla & Firth, 2020).
RESULTS & DISCUSSION
A full genome alignment of 54 representative sarbecoviruses (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and 52
bat coronaviruses) was constructed, and synonymous site conservation was analysed with the
program synplot2 (Firth, 2014) (Fig. 1b). The analysis revealed conserved features towards the 5′
end of ORF1a, in the middle of ORF1a, near the end of ORF1a and start of ORF1b, and in many
parts of the 3′ region of the viral genome. Most of these conserved elements do not correspond to
conserved open reading frames and likely represent functional RNA sequence elements – a case in
point being the frameshift-stimulating RNA pseudoknot (Baranov et al., 2005) at the junction of
ORFs 1a and 1b. However a peak in conservation within ORF3a stood out since, although short, it
coincides with an overlapping alternative-frame AUG-initiated ORF – hereafter ORF3a* –
positioned close to the 5′ end of ORF3a where it might be accessible via ribosomal leaky scanning
(reviewed in Firth & Brierley, 2012).
Closer inspection revealed that the presence and location of the 3a* initiation and stop codons were
conserved across sarbecoviruses. The 3a* AUG codon is present in all except one of the 54
sequences, where it is replaced with GUG (MG772933, a bat CoV). In all 54 sequences, there is an
A at the −3 position giving a strong initiation context (Kozak, 1986). The GUG in MG772933 may
also serve as an initiation site as GUG codons can be utilized for initiation – at a reduced efficiency
compared to AUG – when in a strong initiation context (reviewed in Firth & Brierley, 2012). In 52
sequences there are two upstream AUGs – the ORF3a AUG (weak context; C or U at −3) and
another AUG also in the ORF3a reading frame (weak context; U at −3); in the remaining two
sequences the second of these AUGs is absent. The two weak-context AUGs might enable a
proportion of pre-initiation scanning 43S complexes loaded on the ORF3a sgmRNA to leaky scan
to the 3a* initiation codon. The 3a* ORF has length 40 codons in all 54 sequences except one,
namely SARS-CoV-2, where it is 41 codons in length (Fig. 2). The SARS-CoV-2 putative 3a*
protein has a molecular mass of 4.9 kDa and a pI of 10.9. The protein is also predicted to contain a
transmembrane domain (Fig. 2). Curiously, the transmembrane amino acids are relative highly

conserved, suggesting they may form interactions within the lipid bilayer for example membranedisrupting or membrane-associated signalling activities.
Ribosome profiling is a high throughput sequencing technique that allows footprinting of initiating
and/or elongating ribosomes at sub-codon resolution and hence the global identification of initiation
sites and/or sequence regions and reading frames undergoing translation (Ingolia et al., 2009;
Irigoyen et al., 2016). A recent ribosome profiling study of cells infected with SARS-COV-2
revealed 23 novel translated ORFs (Finkel et al., 2020). Ten are very short (≤ 15 codons). Seven of
the remainder comprise 5′ extensions or 5′ truncations of previously known ORFs (M, 6, 7a, 7b, 9b
and 10). Two are uORFs positioned on the gRNA upstream of ORF1a that may play a role in
regulating ORF1a/1b expression as previously proposed for uORFs in other coronaviruses (Wu et
al., 2014; Irigoyen et al., 2016). After excluding these ORFs, only four novel translated ORFs
remain: ORF3a* (25457..25582; 41 codons), another ORF overlapping ORF3a (25596..25697; 33
codons), an ORF overlapping the S ORF (21744..21863; 39 codons) and a truncated version of the
same (21768..21863; 31 codons) (where numbers indicate ORF coordinates in NC_045512.2). We
investigated the four overlapping ORFs (yellow rectangles, Fig. 3) and found only ORF3a* to
coincide with a synonymous site conservation signal. Moreover, the other novel ORFs were not
conserved: in many sarbecovirus sequences they lacked the AUG codon and were interrupted by
stop codons (Fig. 3).
Although synonymous site conservation can result from overlapping non-coding or coding
elements, the conserved presence and conserved positions of the ORF3a* start and stop codons
suggests the latter interpretation. Moreover, the ribosome profiling study of Finkel et al. (2020)
confirms that the ORF3a* is indeed translated during infection. The combination of comparative
genomics showing purifying selection (which to a large extent is synonymous with functional
importance) and ribosome profiling showing expession strongly suggests that 3a* is a functional
protein, conserved throughout sarbecoviruses. While the known SARS-CoV-2 genes have already
been studied in SARS-CoV-1 (reviewed in Liu et al., 2014), 3a* has never before been studied.
Clearly additional work with SARS-CoV reverse genetics systems will be required to elucidate the
3a* protein function, but it may eventually provide a new target for vaccine or antiviral strategies.
The synplot2 analysis (Fig. 1b) can also reveal other functional elements embedded within the viral
protein-coding genes, which may also be worthy of experimental investigation.
During preparation of this manuscript, 3a* was independently discovered by Cagliani et al., (2020)
(where it is termed 3h) who performed a similar analysis with synplot2 but using far fewer
sarbecovirus sequences, and hence achieving lower statistical significance for conserved elements.
METHODS
Sequences with 100% coverage of, and ≥70% amino acid identity to the SARS-CoV-2 pp1ab
sequence were identified with NCBI tblastn (Altschul et al., 1990) on 12 January 2020 and
downloaded. These cut-off thresholds corresponded precisely to genus Sarbecovirus. Sequences
that did not cover the entire protein-coding region of the genome, and all sequences with >99%
amino acid identity in pp1ab to SARS-CoV-1 except a single reference sequence NC_004718.3
were removed. This left 54 sequences (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and 52 bat CoVs) with

Synonymous site conservation was analyzed with synplot2 (Firth, 2014). For the full-genome
analyses, codon-respecting alignments were produced using a procedure described previously
(Firth, 2014). In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference
sequence (GenBank accession number NC_045512.2) using code2aln version 1.2 (Stocsits et al.,
2005). Genomes were then mapped to NC_045512.2 coordinates by removing alignment positions
that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were
combined to give the multiple sequence alignment. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the
known virus coding regions were extracted from the alignment (with codons selected from the
longer ORF in each overlap region), concatenated in-frame, and the alignment analyzed with
synplot2 using a 25-codon sliding window. Conservation statistics were then mapped back to
NC_045512.2 coordinates for plotting (Fig. 1).
For the ORF S and 3a analyses (Fig. 3), the ORF S and 3a regions were extracted from all 54
sarbecovirus sequences, translated to amino acids, aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004), and the
amino acid alignments were used to guide codon-respecting nucleotide sequence alignments
(EMBOSS tranalign; Rice et al., 2000). These alignments were analyzed with synplot2, again using
a 25-codon window size. In contrast to the full-genome alignments, all alignment gaps were
retained instead of mapping to NC_045512.2 coordinates.
Molecular mass and isoelectric point were calculated with EMBOSS pepstats (Rice et al., 2000).
Transmembrane domains were predicted with Phobius (Käll et al., 2007).
