Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for
effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an
attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to
SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development
is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic
immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal
adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through
the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a
Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant
systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Introduction
First reported in late 2019 in China (Zhu et al., 2020), infection caused severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a global pandemic in just a
few months. As of 5 October 2020, the World Health Organization estimates 34.8 million cases
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, with 1,030,738 associated deaths (WHO.
2020a). Moreover, morbidity from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be severe, especially in high-risk
groups (e.g., elderly, persons with chronic comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, and
diabetes) (CDC, 2020a). Early evidence from COVID-19 survivors and survivors of similar coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), suggests that
COVID-19 survivors may suffer long-term sequela (e.g., inflammation of and damage to lungs
and heart muscle) (Advisory Board, 2020). Taken together, the reach of infection and its impact
on human health and well-being underscore the immediate need for safe and effective vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 to end this pandemic and prevent its return.
Despite the well-recognized role of mucosal immunity in prevention of disease (reviewed in Van
Ginkel et al., 2000 and Holmgren et al., 2005), most of the COVID-19 vaccines in clinical
testing are administered via intramuscular injection (Funk et al., 2020, WHO 2020b) – a route
that elicits systemic immunity without inducing mucosal immune responses. The lack of mucosal
immunity may limit the utility of intramuscularly administered COVID-19 vaccines, given that
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily via respiratory droplets released by infected
individuals in enclosed spaces (CDC, 2020b), with the nose and other portions of the respiratory
mucosa being the primary routes of entry (Li et al., 2020). The nasal compartment shows
particular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to abundant co-expression of the viral
entry receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, ACE-2) and a required activating protease

(TMPRSS2) in nasal goblet and ciliated cells (Sungnak et al., 2020). These cells are thought to
be the most likely initial infection route for the virus and it is hypothesized that the nasal cavity
serves as the initial reservoir for subsequent seeding of the virus to the lungs (Hou et al., 2020).
The well-documented association of anosmia with COVID-19 further supports the nasal cavity
as a principle reservoir of infection (Brann et al., 2020), and presence of high viral load in the
nasal cavity may facilitate transmission of the virus. In contrast to intramuscular injection,
mucosal vaccination via the intranasal route has the potential to confer sterilizing immunity in
the respiratory tract (Hassan et al., 2020), reducing virus-induced disease and transmission of
COVID-19.
Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells depends on binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
of the spike protein to ACE-2, leading to fusion of the virus with the cell membrane (reviewed
by Letko et al., 2020), and in human convalescent serum the majority of neutralizing antibodies
are directed against RBD (Seydoux et al., 2020, Premkumar et al., 2020). While most clinically
advanced SARS-CoV vaccine candidates deliver the trimeric spike ectodomain as the target
antigen (Funk et al., 2020, WHO 2020b), subdomains of spike such as S1 and RBD represent
alternative vaccine antigens for stimulating of a more focused immune response against these
well-conserved domains, while limiting the induction non-functional antibodies and the risk of
enhanced respiratory diseases (ERD).
Here, we report results of preclinical immunogenicity testing of AdCOVID, an intranasal
replication-deficient Ad5- vectored vaccine candidate against COVID-19 that encodes the RBD
from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Immunogenicity of the vaccine was assessed following a
single administration in two strains of mice by measuring the induction of spike-specific
antibody levels in sera and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Functionality of these vaccine5

elicited antibodies was measured in live virus neutralization assays. In addition to the induction
of robust neutralizing antibody responses and mucosal IgA against SARS-CoV-2, the RBD
vaccine candidate stimulated systemic and mucosal cell-mediated immune responses
characterized by a T-helper 1 (Th1) type cytokine profile and through the induction of cytokineproducing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including lung-resident memory T (Trm) cells. These data,
which demonstrate the immunogenicity of AdCOVID, support development of this candidate
vaccine in response to the serious global health threat.

Results
Systemic and mucosal antibody responses induced by intranasal vaccine candidates
expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen subdomains.
Three candidate COVID-19 vaccines were prepared using a replication-deficient E1- and E3deleted Ad5 vector platform (Tang et al 2009). These Ad5 vectors were engineered to encode the
human codon-optimized gene for full-length (FL) spike antigen (residues 1 to 1273), the S1
subdomain (residues 16 to 685) or RBD (residues 302 to 543) from the Wuhan-1 strain of SARSCoV-2 (accession number QHD43416). Initial analysis of the FL vector indicated that antigen
expression level and vector yield were significantly lower compared to the other two vaccine
candidates, therefore, only the S1 and RBD vectors were evaluated in this study.
Immunogenicity of the S1 and RBD vectors was evaluated in both inbred C57BL/6J and outbred
CD-1 mice. Mice received a single intranasal administration of the control vehicle or the Ad5
vectors tested at 3.35E+08 ifu (high dose), 6E+07 ifu (medium dose) or 6E+06 ifu (low dose)
except for the high dose S1 vector that was tested in C57BL/6J mice at 6E+08 ifu. Following
vaccine administration on day 0, serum and BAL samples were collected between days 7-28
(C57BL/6J) or days 7- 21 (CD-1). IgG and IgA antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike were
measured in serum or BAL samples using a spike cytometric bead array (CBA).
Systemic spike-specific IgG antibody responses in serum were detected in both strains of mice
receiving a single intranasal administration of either the S1 or RBD vaccine (Figure 1). The
RBD vector induced a modestly larger serum spike-specific IgG response compared to the S1
vector – an effect that was more pronounced in the C57BL/6 mice despite the high dose RBD
vector being half that of the high dose S1 vector. Moreover, intranasal administration of both the

S1 vaccine and the RBD vaccine led to rapid elevation of spike-specific IgG (Supplementary
Figure 1) in the BAL of both strains of mice.
The induction of mucosal immunity in BAL following a single intranasal dose of the S1 or RBD
vaccine vectors was then assessed. Intranasal immunization is known to stimulate mucosal IgA
antibodies, providing a first line of defense at the point of inoculation of respiratory pathogens
(reviewed in Boyaka 2017). Pathogen-specific IgAs have previously been correlated with
protection from respiratory infections such as influenza (Gould et al 2017, Belshe et al., 2000).
As shown in Figure 2, both RBD and S1 vaccines induced a spike-specific IgA response at
medium and high doses of vaccine. The reason for the markedly greater induction if IgA in CD-1
mice is not known but may be related to mouse strain-specific predisposition to produce innate
and vaccine-induced mucosal IgA (Franssen et al., 2015).
Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were measured in a focus
reduction neutralization test (FRNT) using the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020.
The analysis included S1 and RBD samples from C57BL/6J mice 4-weeks after vaccination with
either medium or high-dose vaccine, and RBD samples from CD-1 mice 3-weeks after
vaccination with the high vaccine dose (Figure 3). RBD elicited significantly greater
neutralizing titers compared to S1 under all conditions evaluated. At the highest dose, intranasal
vaccination with RBD induced neutralizing antibody responses above background in 10 of 10
C57BL/6J mice and 8 of 10 CD-1 mice with a median titer of 563 and 431, respectively (Figure
3A). The level of the neutralizing antibody response was well-correlated with magnitude of the
spike-specific serum IgG response measured in individual animals (Figure 3B and 3C),
indicating that robust antibody responses to RBD were associated with generation of potentially
protective neutralizing antibodies.

Recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells in the respiratory tract following
intranasal RBD vector administration.
Given the markedly greater neutralization titers obtained with the RBD vaccine candidate
compared to the S1 candidate, the RBD vaccine was further evaluated with respect to cellular
immunity. Flow cytometric analysis of immune cells was performed in BAL, lung, mediastinal
lymph node (medLN) and spleen samples following intranasal administration of the RBD vector
in C57BL/6J mice. Consistent with the hypothesis that mucosal administration of the vaccine
would induce innate and adaptive pulmonary immune responses, rapid recruitment of immune
cells into the lung was observed following intranasal vaccination with the RBD vector (Figure
4). Indicative of an early innate immune activation, significant increases in the number of
dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells were observed, which peaked at day 7 postvaccination. Rapid recruitment of adaptive immune cells including T follicular helper cells (Tfh)
and B cells to the lung were also observed peaking between days 7-28. Similar trends were
observed in the medLN (Supplementary Figure 2) and BAL (Supplementary Figure 3) but
were less obvious in the spleen (Supplementary Figure 4).
Mucosal and systemic antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
Emerging data support a role for T cell responses in COVID-19 immunity independent of
antibody responses (Sekine et al., 2020). In addition, animal models have shown that CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells that reside in the respiratory tract are important for local protection immediately
after viral infection (Pizzolla et al., 2017, Laidlaw et al., 2014, Takamura et al., 2017).
To assess vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, RBD Ad5 vector (also
referred to AdCOVID) was administered intranasally to outbred CD-1 mice at a single high dose.

Control animals received vehicle alone administered intranasally. RBD-specific T cell cytokine
responses in lung and spleen samples were assessed following ex vivo re-stimulation with a pool
of 54 peptides (15a.a. long, 11a.a. overlap) covering the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues 319-541.
As measured by ELISpot, a high frequency of IFN-γ-producing RBD-specific T cells were
detected in the lung at 10- and 14-days post-vaccination, reaching a mean response of 915 and
706 spot forming cells per million input cells respectively (Figure 5). IFN-γ producing RBDspecific T cells were also detected by ELISpot in the spleen, albeit at lower frequency compared
to lung. This suggests that functional effector T cells primed in response to mucosally-delivered
antigens can migrate to peripheral lymphoid tissues.
To further characterize the RBD-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to mucosal
vaccination, intracellular cytokine staining was performed on lung and spleen cells from
vaccinated mice. Consistent with ELISpot data, we observed a significant induction of IFN-γ- or
TNF-α-producing T cells in the lung and spleen (Figure 6) of vaccinated animals. These
included both CD11a+CD4+ and CD11a+CD8+ T cells, although response was strongly biased
toward the induction of CD8+ T cells, especially in lung samples. Expression of integrin CD11a,
which is only upregulated in recently activated T cells and is required for optimal vascular
adhesion in the tissue and retention within the respiratory tract (Thatte et al.. 2003), supports the
hypothesis that these cells were recently recruited to the lung. To assess whether these cells are
resident memory T cells (Trm), the expression of the Trm markers CD103 and CD69 (Takamura,
2017) on pulmonary CD4+ and CD8+ cells was determined. Consistent with the intranasal
administration route, induction of lung RDB-specific CD4+ and CD8+ Trm expressing either
IFN-γ, TNF-α or both cytokines were observed (Figure 7).

Our data showed that intranasal administration of RBD vaccine candidate induced T cells
competent to produce IFN-γ and TNF-α – cytokines that are associated with Th-1 biased cellular
response. In addition, the vaccine elicited high frequencies of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that
generally correlate with an IFN-regulated T cell response that is important for control of viral
infection. To further assess the cytokine producing potential of the T cells from vaccinated mice,
Splenic T cells were stimulated with RBD peptides for 48 hours and then used cytokine bead
arrays to measure cytokine levels in the supernatant (Figure 8). As expected, induction of IFN-γ
and TNF-α by the T cells was observed. Moreover, T cells from the vaccinated animals produced
moderate levels of IL-10 compared to T cells from the vehicle control treated mice. Importantly,
Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 and IL-17a levels in the supernatant from re-stimulated cells
derived from the vaccinated mice were equivalent to that seen in cultures containing peptidestimulated cells from the vehicle control animals. These data therefore indicated that intranasal
administration of the RBD vaccine did not initiate a potentially deleterious Th2 response but
rather induced the expected antiviral T cell responses.
Taken altogether, the data show that intranasal administration of the replication-deficient Ad5
vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD generates humoral and cellular immune responses in
both systemic and mucosal sites, particularly within the lungs, which represents a major site for
infection and clinical disease.

Discussion
We demonstrate that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the RBD of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is highly immunogenic in both inbred and outbred mice and
elicits both robust systemic and local antibody and T cell responses. Following a single
intranasal vaccination, AdCOVID elicited a strong and focused immune response against SARSCoV-2 spike antigen through the induction of functional serum antibodies that neutralize wildtype SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as mucosal IgA and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
responses in the respiratory tract. Cell-mediated responses induced by AdCOVID were biased
toward an antiviral response as demonstrated by the high rates of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
and a cytokine expression profile including IFN- and TNF-. Establishment of a resident
memory CD8+ T cell population in the lungs complements robust induction of mucosal IgA
antibody against the spike protein, an important addition to the overall immune response to
AdCOVID.
An interesting observation from our studies was the lower neutralizing antibody titers in animals
receiving the S1 vaccine. We hypothesize that the RBD vector better focused the immune
response on the critical neutralizing epitopes in the spike protein, and similar results were
obtained during the development of vaccines for SARS (Ravichandran et al., 2020). Regardless,
the selection of an Ad5-vector expressing RBD offers two advantages over other forms of the
spike antigen used in COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in clinical development. First, and
in agreement with our data, RBD-based vaccines were previously shown to promote equivalent
or better antibody responses than the full length or S1/S2 ectodomain of spike from SARS-CoV2 including higher affinity interaction compared to the S1 domain (Ravichandran et al., 2020,

Walsh et al., 2020). Second, focusing the immune response on the RBD domain could decrease
the production of potentially pathogenic non-neutralizing antibodies, which can contribute to
enhanced respiratory diseases (ERD).
To date, the COVID-19 vaccine candidates that have advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials have
been based on the intramuscular injection of the vaccine candidate, and there is no widespread
expectation that the current intramuscular vaccine candidates will provide sterilizing immunity in
the nasal cavity even if they prove effective in reducing mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. In
preclinical and clinical studies, these candidates have demonstrated stimulation of serum
neutralizing antibodies, and peripheral T cell responses. However, a fundamental limitation of
these approaches is that they are not designed to elicit mucosal immunity. In a SARS-CoV-2
challenge model in rhesus macaques, a single intramuscular administration of an adenovectored
vaccine candidate was shown to significantly reduce viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue but the level of viral replication in the nasal cavity was
unaffected (van Doremalen at al., 2020). Consistent with that report, several studies assessing
other COVID-19 vaccine candidates have shown that the intranasal route, as opposed to the
intramuscular route, stimulated local mucosal immune responses in addition systemic
neutralizing antibody and T cell responses and achieved sterilizing immunity (Hassan et al.,
2020; Wu et al., 2020). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated the ability of intranasally
administered vaccines to block transmission of influenza between infected and naïve cage-mates
(Lowen et al., 2009; Price et al., 2011),
Nasal administration of replication-deficient human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-vectored
vaccines mimics a route of natural infection and is known to stimulate strong humoral and
cellular immunity, both systemically and mucosally (Croyle et al., 2008). Moreover, intranasal

Ad5-vectored vaccine have been shown to provide effective protection against respiratory
pathogens (Zhang et al., 2011; Krishnan et al., 2015), and the intranasal route of administration
has been demonstrated to bypass preexisting immunity to the vector (Croyle et al., 2008).
Another advantage of intranasal AdCOVID vaccine, compared to other vaccines in development,
is its ease of administration and delivery to patients, as intranasal administration is non-invasive
and obviates the need for needles which may increase vaccine uptake (reviewed in Yusuf et al.,
2017).
In summary, there is a clear unmet need for a vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and its
transmission. In these experiments, AdCOVID induced systemic and mucosal immune responses
within days following single-dose immunization. In the context of a pandemic, AdCOVID has
two compelling advantages. First, non-invasive intranasal administration makes it particularly
well-suited for wide-spread vaccinations of large cohorts. Second, AdCOVID may offer the
ability to control SARS-CoV-2 infection within the upper and lower respiratory tract. This has
the advantages of potentially preventing infection at the site of virus entry, reducing the risk of
significant respiratory disease and decreasing the likelihood of subsequent virus transmission in
vaccinated individuals. Collectively, these findings support further development of AdCOVID
for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections and its transmission.

Material and Methods
Ethics statement and Mice
Mice used in these studies were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (C56BL/6J) or Charles
River Laboratories (CD-1). Animal procedures performed at University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) or Noble Life Sciences (Noble, Woodbine, MD) were conducted in
accordance with Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Studies performed at UAB
were performed under IACUC Approval Number 21203. Studies performed at Noble were
performed under the IACUC Approval Number NLS-591.
Vaccine candidates
Vaccine candidates evaluated in this study were based on a replication-deficient, E1- and E3deleted adenovirus type 5 vector platform (Tang et al., 2009) and expressed a human codonoptimized gene for either the S1 domain (residues 16 to 685) or the RBD domain (residues 302
to 543) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (accession number QHD43416.1). The Ad5-vectored S1
and RBD transgenes included a human tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence and were
expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer. Initial
seed stocks were obtained from a transfection of recombinant vector plasmid into E1complementing PER.C6 cells using a scalable transfection system (Maxcyte STX-100). Cell
transfection was performed by a static electroporation using the CL1.1 Processing Assembly
procedure (Li et al., 2002). Following vector expansion, replication-deficient vector was
obtained from infected cell lysates and was purified over a CsCl gradient, dialyzed against a
formulation buffer containing 10 mM Tris at a pH of 7.4, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM

histidine, 5% (wt/vol) sucrose, 0.02% polysorbate-80 (wt/vol), 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.5%
(vol/vol) ethanol and were then frozen and stored at -65°C.
Adenovirus vaccine titer measurement
293 HEK cells were seeded in a 96-well plate one day before Ad vector infection. After
inoculation of the appropriate dilutions of adenovirus control and test sample(s) onto duplicate
wells, the infected cells were incubated for 3 days. At the end of the infection period, media were
removed, and cells were fixed with cold methanol. Following drying and rinsing with phosphatebuffered saline, mouse anti-adenovirus-5 hexon antibody was added to each well of cells and
incubated at 37°C for at least 60 minutes. After removal of the mouse anti-adenovirus-5 hexon
antibody and additional phosphate-buffered saline washes, HRP-conjugated rat anti-mouse
antibody was added to each well and incubated at least 60 minutes at 37°C. After removal of the
detection antibody and additional phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were stained with
DAB (3, 3-diaminobenzidine) working solution for at least 10 minutes. After removal of DAB
working solution and additional washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline, the stained foci
were enumerated using a microscope with a 20X objective.

Laboratories) mice of at least 6 weeks of age were randomly allocated into vaccination groups.
Replication-deficient Ad5 vector encoding the S1 domain (S1 vector) or the RBD (RBD vector)
from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were administered intranasally in a volume of 50µl. Dose
levels used included high-dose (3.35E+08 ifu), mid-dose (6E+07 ifu) or low-dose (6E+06 ifu) of
vaccine except for the S1 vector tested C57BL/6J mice were the high dose vaccine was 6E+08
ifu. The control group received 50µl of buffer alone by intranasal administration.

Serum Collection
Blood samples were collected from the tail vein of vaccinated mice into BD Microtainer blood
collection tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm at room temperature for 810 minutes and the serum was collected, aliquoted and frozen at -80ºC until analyzed.
Tissue processing and single cell isolation
Spleen, medLN and lung tissues were isolated from vaccinated mice at the indicated timepoints.
Lung tissue was minced and then digested in RPMI-1640 medium containing collagenase (1.25
mg/ml, Sigma) and DNase I (150 units/ml, Sigma) for 45 minutes at 37°C. To generate single
cell suspensions, digested lung, spleen, and draining lymph nodes were passed through a fine
wire mesh. The single cell suspensions were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer and filtered
(100 m) to remove debris.
BAL collection
BAL samples were collected using ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) microbore tubing (Cole-Parmer)
with inner and outer diameters of 0.02 in and 0.06 inches, respectively. One end of the tube was
fitted to a 23G syringe needle attached to a 3-way stopcock. The other end of the tube was
inserted postmortem into an incised trachea. BAL fluid was collected as a single 1ml lavage
fraction using ice-cold phenol-free Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS, without Ca2+ and
Mg2+) containing 2mM EDTA. BAL cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation
at 1800 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein production
To produce recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain protein, two human codon-optimized
constructs were generated with linear sequence order encoding: a human IgG leader sequence,

the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (amino acids 14-1211), a GGSG linker, T4 fibritin foldon
sequence, a GS linker, and finally an AviTag (construct 1) or 6X-HisTag (construct 2). Each
construct was engineered with two sets of mutations to stabilize the protein in a pre-fusion
conformation. These included substitution of RRAR>SGAG (residues 682 to 685, as in Walls et
al., 2020) at the S1/S2 cleavage site and the introduction of two proline residues; K983P, V984P,
as in Walls et al., 2020 and Wrapp et al., 2020). Avi/His-tagged trimers were produced by cotransfecting plasmid constructs 1 and 2 (1:2 ratio) into FreeStyle 293-F cells. Cells were grown
for three days and the supernatant (media) was recovered by centrifugation. Recombinant spike
trimers were purified from media by Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using a HisTrap
HP Column (GE) and elution with 250mM of imidazole. After exchanging into either 10mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 or 50mM Bicine, pH 8.3, purified spike ectodomain trimers were biotinylated
by addition of biotin-protein ligase (Avidity, Aurora, CO). Biotinylated spike ectodomain trimers
were buffer exchanged into PBS, sterile filtered, aliquoted, then stored at -80ºC until used.
SARS-CoV-2 spike cytometric bead array
To generate the spike cytometric bead array (CBA), recombinant SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain
trimers were passively absorbed onto streptavidin functionalized fluorescent microparticles
(Spherotech 3.6um cat# CPAK-3567-4K, peak 4). 500 µg of biotinylated SARS2-CoV-2 was
incubated with 2E+07 Streptavidin functionalized fluorescent microparticles in 400l of 1%
BSA in PBS. Following coupling, the SARS-CoV-2 spike conjugated beads were washed twice
in 1ml of 1% BSA, PBS, 0.05% NaN3, resuspended at 1E+08 beads/mL and stored at 4°C. The
loading of recombinant SARS2-CoV-2 spike onto the beads was evaluated by staining 1E+05
beads with dilutions ranging from 1g to 2ng/ml of the recombinant anti-SARS spike antibody
CR3022 and visualized with an anti-human IgG secondary antibody.

CBA IgG and IgA standards
IgG and IgA standards were generated by covalent coupling of isotype-specific polyclonal
antibodies to fluorescent particles. Briefly, 0.2 mg of goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (southern
Biotech cat# 1013-01), anti-IgM (cat#1 022-01), and anti-IgA (cat# 1040-01) antibodies in PBS
were mixed with 5E+07 fluorescent microparticles each with a unique fluorescent intensity in the
far red channels (Spherotech 3.6um cat# CPAK-3567-4K, peaks 1-3) resuspended in 0.1 M MES
buffer pH 5.0. An equal volume of EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide),
10mg/mL, in 0.1 M MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid) buffer pH 5.0 was added and
the mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature. The beads were washed twice by
pelleting by centrifugation and resuspension in PBS. Following washing, beads were
resuspended in 1% BSA in PBS with 0.005% NaN3 as a preservative.
CBA measurement of spike-specific IgG and IgA responses
The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and IgA was performed in serum or BAL samples
obtained from immunized animals using the spike CBA described above. BAL samples (diluted
1/4-8) or serum samples (diluted to 1/1000-5000) in 50µl of PBS were arrayed in 96 well ubottom polystyrene plates along with 50l of standards consisting of either mouse IgG, IgM, or
IgA ranging from 1µg/ml to 2ng/ml at 0.75x dilutions (Southern Biotech IgM: cat# 0106-01,
IgG: cat# 0107-01, IgA cat# 0106-01). 5µl of a suspension containing 5E+05 of each SARSCoV-2 spike, anti-IgM, anti-IgA, and anti-IgG beads was added to the diluted samples. The
suspensions were mixed by pipetting and incubated for 15 minutes at RT. The beads were
washed by the addition of 200µl of PBS and centrifuged at 3000g for 5 minutes at RT. The
cytometric bead array (CBA) particles were resuspended in a secondary staining solution
consisting of polyclonal anti-IgG 488 (southern Biotech cat#1010-30), and either a goat

polyclonal anti-IgM (southern Biotech cat# 1020-09) or anti-IgA (southern Biotech cat# 104009) conjugated to PE diluted 1/400 in 1% BSA in PBS. The suspension was incubated for 15
minutes in the dark at room temperature. The beads were washed by the addition of 200 µl of
PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 3000g for 5 min at RT. The particles were resuspended in
75µl of PBS and directly analyzed on a BD Cytoflex flow cytometer in plate mode at sample rate
of 100 l per minute. Sample collection was stopped following the acquisition of 75 µL.
Following acquisition, the resulting FCS files were analyzed in flowJo (treestar). Briefly, the
beads were identified by gating on singlet 3.6 m particles in log scale in the forward scatter and
side scatter parameters. APC-Cy7 channel fluorescence gates were used to segregate the particles
by bead identity. Geometric mean fluorescent intensity was calculated in the PE and 488
channels. Best fit power curves were generated from the Ig capture beads using the known
concentration of standards on a plate by plate basis. This formula was applied to the MFI of the
SARS-COV-2 spike particles for all samples of the corresponding assay converting MFI to
ng/ml or µg/ml. These calculated values were corrected for the dilution factor.
Neutralizing antibody titers
A focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) was used to quantify the titer of neutralizing
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020. Vero E6 cells were grown on 96-well
plates to confluence. On the day of the infection phase of the assay, serial dilutions (1:20-1:2560)
of antisera were made and combined and incubated with an equal volume of viral stock, at a
specified dilution for 30 minutes at room temperature, such that the final dilutions of antisera
ranged from 1:40 to 1:5120. The viral stock was diluted from a concentrated working stock to
produce an estimated 30 viral focal units per well. After incubation, the sera:virus mixtures were
added to the wells (100µL), and infection allowed to proceed for 1 hour on the Vero cells at
21

35°C. At the completion of the 1-hour incubation, a viscous overlay of Eagle’s MEM with 4%
FBS and antibiotics and 1.2% Avicell were added to sera:virus mixture on the cell monolayers
such that the final volume was 200 µL per well. The infection was allowed to proceed for 24
hr. The next day, each plate was fixed by submerging the entire plate and contents in 10%
formalin/PBS for 24 h. Detection of virus foci reduction was performed on the fixed 96 well
plates. Briefly, plates were rinsed in H2O, and methanol:hydrogen peroxide added to the wells
for 30 min with rocking to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After quenching, plates were
rinsed in H2O to remove methanol and 5% Blotto was added to the wells as a blocking solution
for 1 hour. For primary antibody detection, a SARS-CoV-2 spike/RBD antibody (Rabbit,
Polyclonal, SinoBiologicals Ct No. 40592-T62) was added to 5% Blotto and incubated on the
monolayers overnight. Plates were washed 5X with PBS, and further incubated with a goat antirabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Boster Biological Technology Co., #BA10540.5) in 5% Blotto for 1 hr. Plates were rinsed once with 0.05% Tween in 1X PBS followed by 5
washes in 1X PBS. Impact DAB detection kit (Vector Labs #SK-4105) was used to detect
peroxidase activity. Brown foci were counted manually from the scanned image of each well,
recorded, and the reduction of foci as compared to equivalent naïve mouse sera controls was
determined. FRNT50 titers were calculated using a 4PL curve fit to determine the serum dilution
corresponding to a 50% reduction in the foci present in control wells.
Flow cytometry analysis of innate and adaptive immune cells.
Cell numbers per tissue were determined by mixing 20 µl of each single cell suspension into a
96-well plate with 50 l of 8.4 x 104 Fluoresbrite Carboxylate YG 10 µm microspheres/ml
(Polysciences Inc.) and 180 l staining media (dPBS + 2% FBS) containing 2 mM EDTA (SME)
and 7-AAD (1:720 dilution). To perform flow cytometric analysis, 200 µl of each sample were

dilution) and Aqua LIVE/DEAD (1:1000 dilution). Cells stained with the myeloid panel were
incubated with the antibody mix (50 l total volume) for 20 minutes at 4°C in the dark. The B
cell panel consisted of CD95/FAS-FITC (clone Jo2; 1:200 dilution), F4/80-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone
BM8; 1:200 dilution), CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone 17A2; 1:200 dilution), CD38-PE-Cy7 (clone 90;
1:400 dilution), CD19-APC-Fire750 (clone 6D5; 1:200 dilution), CD138-BV421 (clone 281-2;
1:200 dilution) and IgD-BV510 (clone 11-26c.2a; 1:500 dilution). Cells stained with the B cell
panel were incubated with antibody mix (50 l total volume) for 45 min at 4°C in the dark. The
BAL panel consisted of Ly6G-PE (clone 1A8; 1:200 dilution), CD64-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone X545/7.1; 1:150 dilution), CD8a-APC (clone 53-6.7; 1:200 dilution), CD11c-PE-Cy7 (clone N418;
1:200 dilution), CD19-APC/Fire750 (clone 6D5; 1:200 dilution; CD4-eFLUOR450 (clone
GK1.5; 1:200 dilution) and Aqua LIVE/DEAD (1:1000 dilution). Cells stained with the BAL
panel were incubated with the antibody mix (50 l total volume) for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.
Following incubation with the different flow cytometry panels, the cells were washed,
resuspended in 100 µl of eBioscience fixation buffer (00-5521-00) and incubated for 20 min at 4
ºC. After incubation, the cells were spun down and resuspended in 200 l SME. Stained and
fixed cells from all antibody panels and cell counting panels were analyzed on a BD Canto II.

Synthetic RBD peptides.
For analysis of T cell responses, a pool of 53 peptides derived from a peptide scan through RBD
of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (319-541) was designed and synthesized by JPT (JPT Peptide
technologies, Berlin, Germany). Peptides were designed with a length of 15 a.a. and an overlap
of 11a.a. Before use, each vial containing 15 nmol (appr. 25µg) of each peptide per vial was
reconstituted in 50µl of DMSO before dilution into complete culture media.
IFN-γ ELIspot
Spleen and lung cell suspensions (150,000 cells/well) were placed in individual wells of ELIspot
plates (Millipore-Sigma) that were pre-coated with anti-IFN-γ (AN18, 5 g/ml). Cells were
stimulated with the RBD peptide pool described above at 2.0 g/peptide/ml. Following 24 hr
stimulation, plates were stained with biotinylated anti-IFN- (R4-6A2), followed by washing
steps, and incubation with streptavidin-ALP. Secreted IFN- was detected following incubation
with NBT/NCPI substrate for 7-10 min. The number of IFN-γ spot-forming cells were manually
counted from digital images of each well.
Intracellular cytokine staining
The analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in lung tissues and spleens by flow cytometry
was performed as follows. Spleen and lung single cell suspensions were stimulated with the
RBD peptide pool for 5 hrs in the presence of Brefeldin A (5 hrs, 12.5 ug/mL concentration).
Cells were then incubated on ice with a combination of fluorescent dye-labelled antibodies
including anti-CD4-V500 (clone GK1.5; 1:200 dilution), anti-CD8α-APC-Fire750 (clone 53-6.7;
1:200 dilution), anti-CD11a/CD18-Pacific Blue (H155-78; 1:200 dilution), anti-CD103-PE
(M290; 1:200 dilution), anti-CD69-FITC (H1-2F3; 1:200 dilution), anti-Ly6G-PerCP-Cy5.5

(clone 1A8; 1:200 dilution), anti-CD64- PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone X54-5/7.1; 1:200 dilution), antiB220/CD45R- PerCP (clone RA3-6B2; 1:200 dilution), and Red LIVE/DEAD (1:1000 dilution).
Following surface staining, cells were permeabilized using BD Biosciences Cytofix/Cytoperm
kit and stained with anti-IFN-γ-PE-Cy7 (XMG1.2; 1:200 dilution) and anti-TNF-α-APC (MP6XT22; 1:200 dilution). Following incubation with the antibodies, cells were washed and
resuspended before analysis on FACSCanto II within 12 hours.
Measurement of inflammatory cytokines in culture supernatants
Protein levels of IFNγ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A and TNFα were quantified in
culture supernatants using the mouse-specific Milliplex® multi-analyte panel kit MT17MAG47K (Millipore; Sigma) and the MagPix® instrument platform with related xPONENT®
software (Luminex Corporation). The readouts were analyzed with the standard version of EMD
Millipore’s Milliplex® Analyst software.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Statistical significance was assigned when P values were < 0.05 using Prism Version 8.4.2
(GraphPad). All tests and values are indicated in the relevant Figure legends.
