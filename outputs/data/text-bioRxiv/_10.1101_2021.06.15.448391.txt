Low-dose fluvoxamine modulates endocytic
trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a
potential mechanism for anti-COVID-19 protection
by antidepressants
Abstract
Commonly prescribed antidepressants may be associated with protection against
severe COVID-19, with one drug (fluvoxamine) currently undergoing a Phase 3 clinical
trial. The mechanism of their action, however, remains unknown. Here, I investigated
the effect of fluvoxamine on membrane trafficking of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
and its cell host receptor ACE2 in HEK293T cells. A sub-therapeutic concentration (80
nM) of fluvoxamine rapidly upregulated fluid-phase endocytosis, resulting in
enhanced accumulation of the spike-ACE2 complex in enlarged early endosomes.
Diversion of endosomal trafficking may provide a simple cell biological mechanism
consistent with the protective effect of antidepressants against COVID-19,
highlighting their therapeutic and prophylactic potential.

Main text
More than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about ongoing disruption of daily
activities, severe economic downturn and unprecedented healthcare crisis across most of
the world’s nations. Although relatively rapid COVID-19 vaccine development has been
generally considered a success, vaccine availability is currently limited by the logistical
difficulties pertaining to production, storage and distribution1; furthermore, periodic
emergence of novel strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus fuels recurring concerns about vaccine
efficacy and future-proofing2. Therefore, repurposing of cheap, readily available and safe
drugs against COVID-19 remains a major healthcare priority.
One promising group of candidate drugs is antidepressants, which have been linked to
protection against severe COVID-19 in several post-hoc clinical studies3, and may block
SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in cell models4–7. Foremost amongst these is a generic
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine, that has been shown to protect
against severe COVID-19 in a Phase 2 trial8 as well as a real-world study9 and is currently
undergoing a Phase 3 study10. The suggested protective effect of fluvoxamine has been
tentatively linked to modulation of immune response through activation of the ER stress and
sigma receptor11, or blockade of acid sphingomyelinase7,12,13, however the underlying cell
biological mechanism remains unknown.
It had been suggested that pharmacological modulation of SARS-CoV-2 membrane
trafficking might offer a strategy for both treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19, and a list of
candidate drugs included fluvoxamine14. Given the emergence of clinical data suggesting
efficacy of fluvoxamine against COVID-19, the effect of fluvoxamine treatment on membrane

trafficking was assessed in a cell line. To this end, HEK293T cells were treated with a range
of fluvoxamine concentrations. Although standard dosing of fluvoxamine results in
considerable brain enrichment of the drug (10 uM)15, its concentrations in the blood plasma
are much lower16, therefore a range of concentrations was used. Treatment for 1 h resulted
in a significant increase in endocytosis, as measured by the membrane FM dye uptake
(Figure 1a,b). Remarkably, this increase was apparent at as little as 80 nM fluvoxamine,
equivalent to approximately 1/5th of the blood plasma concentration16.
To verify upregulation of endocytosis, uptake of the fluid-phase biologically inert endocytic
marker fluorescent dextran FluoroRuby was also measured. Treatment with low
concentrations of fluvoxamine resulted in a significant increase in FluoroRuby uptake
mirroring the effect on the FM dye uptake, confirming the increase in both the membrane
area and the volume of endocytosis (Figure 1c,d). Higher concentrations of fluvoxamine
resulted in cell rounding and detachment (data not shown), indicating a possible cytotoxic
effect. Taken together, these observations suggest that sub-therapeutic doses of
fluvoxamine may rapidly alter endocytosis in a non-specific manner.
The non-specific nature of the fluvoxamine effect suggested that it could also affect
trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 as postulated previously14. To investigate this possibility, the key
steps of SARS-CoV-2 ingress were recreated by imaging internalisation of recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein17 into HEK293T cells transiently transfected with a plasmid
expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE218. Consistent with the effect on
fluid-phase and membrane endocytosis, 1 h incubation with 80 nM fluvoxamine resulted in a
significant increase in spike protein internalization, as measured by the ratio of the internal
spike labelling to that at the surface (Figure 1e,f). Relative levels of surface-bound spike
protein were not changed following 1 h treatment, suggesting that surface binding to the
ACE2 and recycling of the internalised ACE2 back to the plasma membrane were unaffected
by the drug treatment (Figure 1g). From these results it can be concluded that fluvoxamine
treatment upregulates endocytosis of spike protein.
Following endocytosis, internalised cargoes proceed to early endosomes, where they
undergo sorting to be recycled back to the cell surface or trafficked into late
endosomes/lysosomes. Transit through early endosomes has been implicated as a key
stage in coronaviral infection12,19–22. To investigate the effect of fluvoxamine treatment on
early endosomes, cells were immunostained for a canonical early endosome marker EEA1.
In line with previously published data19, internalised spike protein co-localised with
EEA1-positive puncta, suggesting that early/recycling endosomes are likely to be involved in
SARS-CoV-2 trafficking (Figure 1h). Fluvoxamine treatment significantly enlarged EEA1
positive puncta, consistent with increased endosomal capacity as evidenced by the increase
in fluid-phase uptake (Figure S1a); in contrast, the morphology of late endosomes as shown
by immunostaining for a late endosome marker LAMP1 was not visibly affected. Thus, low
doses of fluvoxamine may enhance trafficking through early but not late endosomes.
Two more antidepressants identified as candidates for modulating SARS-CoV-2 membrane
trafficking14 were a SSRI sertraline and a tricyclic drug imipramine, both of which have
recently been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in epithelial cells7. Their effect on
endocytosis was tested as described above. Treatment with low therapeutic concentrations
of sertraline (80 nM) and imipramine (200 nM) resulted in an increase in endocytosis as
evidenced by FM dye uptake (Figure S1b,c). Higher concentrations of sertraline did not

produce an increase in FM uptake, consistent with either cytotoxicity or previously reported
inhibition of dynamin function and endocytosis blockade23. Global upregulation of
endocytosis may therefore represent a generalized feature of low-dose antidepressant
treatment.
In summary, it was found that a short-duration treatment with a sub-therapeutic
concentration of fluvoxamine results in a significant rearrangement of membrane trafficking
in a human cell line, enhancing endocytic uptake of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins through
early endosomes. This finding is consistent with a mechanism involving re-routing of the
internalised ACE2/Spike complex into the early/recycling endosome away from the late
endosome/lysosome (Figure 1i). Given the emerging role of the late endosome/lysosome in
both SARS-CoV-2 infection and release12,20,24–28, preferential retention in the early/recycling
endosome may provide a cell biological framework underlying the putative clinical benefits of
fluvoxamine. The molecular mechanisms behind this cell biological process, however,
remain to be determined. The sigma receptor-independent mode of action is supported by
the similarity in the effects of low concentration fluvoxamine (sigma receptor agonist) and
sertraline (sigma receptor antagonist). At micromolar concentrations, fluvoxamine, sertraline,
imipramine and other antidepressants and antipsychotics may act as functional inhibitors of
acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA)29; another noteworthy possibility is direct regulation of the
plasma membrane properties through lipophilic association with the lipid bilayer30.
Only the drugs from the previously published list of candidates14 were included in this work,
with most of the focus being on fluvoxamine due to its clinical potential. However, emerging
laboratory and clinical evidence hints at the possible therapeutic potential of other
antidepressants3–5,7,12. Diversion of SARS-CoV-2 away from its productive infectious route
could imply that antidepressants may not only protect against severe COVID-19, but prevent
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first place. Given the wide prevalence of SSRI prescriptions in
outpatient treatment of moderate psychiatric disorders, the prophylactic potential for SSRIs
may be assessed by performing post-hoc studies of COVID-19 incidence in the general
population.
It must be emphasised that, given the ongoing proliferation of non-peer-reviewed COVID-19
publications31, the findings reported here should be interpreted with caution and chiefly
considered as a basis for further investigation. Importantly, antidepressant-dependent
SARS-CoV-2 membrane trafficking needs to be tracked in more detail and verified in
physiologically relevant systems featuring infection with live SARS-CoV-2 particles32. Finally,
the reported impact on membrane trafficking mechanisms may be of relevance in the context
of multiple side-effects associated with antidepressants, suggesting that cell biology of
psychiatric drugs outside the central nervous system33 merits further investigation.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Cell culture materials were from Gibco. Drugs were from Sigma-Aldrich. FM Dyes and
FluoroRuby were from Thermo Fisher. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the
anti-spike mouse polyclonal antibody were kindly provided by Dr. Paul F. McKay
(Department of Infectious Disease, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London) through
the COVID-19 Crowdfight initiative. The following rabbit antibodies were used: anti-EEA1,
anti-ACE2 (GeneTex), anti-LAMP1 FITC conjugated (Sino Biological), anti-6xHis HRP
conjugated (Abcam). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch.

Cell culture and uptake assays
HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum. For
experiments, cells were grown on 13mm round thickness 1.5 coverslips coated with
poly-L-Lysine. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and used 24-48 hours
afterwards. All uptake experiments were performed at 37°C. For uptake experiments ,
probes were diluted in culture medium and added to the coverslips in presence of indicated
concentrations of drugs or vehicle (DMSO) for indicated periods of time. FM dyes (FM4-64fx
and FM1-43fx) were used at the final concentration of 20 ug/ml, FluoroRuby was used at the
final concentration of 0.1% w/v, Spike protein was used at the final concentration of 0.14
ug/ml. For FM dye and FluoroRuby uptake measurements, cells were fixed, mounted and
imaged without further processing.

Immunocytochemistry and microscopy
All steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% w/v
paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in the ICC buffer (0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 5% w/v
horse serum in PBS), stained with the primary antibodies for 1 hour. The following antibody
dilutions (v/v) were used: 1/1000 (anti-spike), 1/1000 (anti-6xHis), 1/500 (anti-ACE2), 1/400
(anti-EEA1), 1/400 (anti-LAMP1). For spike protein uptake measurements, cells were fixed,
immunostained with the anti-6xHis antibody for 30 min to label the surface pool,
permeabilized, immunostained with an anti-spike antibody for 30 min to label the total spike
pool. For surface and total ACE2 measurements, coverslips were live-labelled with spike
protein for 30 min before fixation to label the surface pool of ACE2. Following fixation and
permeabilization, coverslips were labelled with the anti-ACE2 antibody to visualise the total
pool of ACE2. Finally, coverslips were incubated with the anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 and
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted in
Fluoromount-G medium (Southern) and imaged in the EVOS M7000 widefield imaging
system (Thermo Fisher) using the 100x objective. Quantification of the images was carried
out in ImageJ. For measurement of Spike internalisation, intensity of total Spike labelling
was divided by intensity of the surface Spike labelling. All data was normalised to the median
values in the vehicle-treated sample.
