Abstract
At present, global immunity to SARS-CoV-2 resides within a heterogeneous combination of
susceptible, naturally infected and vaccinated individuals. The extent to which viral shedding and
transmission occurs on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 after prior natural exposure or vaccination is
an emerging area of understanding. We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model
the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk
(inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral
shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount,
duration and consistency of viral shedding were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were
reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. Amount and duration of viral
shedding were correlated with re-exposure type and serologic status. 59% of seropositive
animals shed virus. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit
virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated
intranasally with a related virus (Parkers Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only
4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding.
Observed cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36
cycles, however observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission. Results indicate that
low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate
infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that
continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated
individuals is possible.

Introduction
Individual immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be gained through natural infection or
vaccination. As a route to achieving population-wide immune protection, the former route,
otherwise known as infection-induced herd immunity, is widely regarded as an ineffective
strategy [1]. This route achieves unpredictable immunity [2-5] and incurs substantial morbidity
[6] and mortality [5,7]. Consequently, mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is underway as the
safest and most effective means of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [8].
For either route, our understanding of the extent to which previously naturally exposed [9-11] or
vaccinated [12] individuals can shed and transmit virus on re-exposure is just emerging.
Immunologic heterogeneity following natural infection [10,11,13], variable efficacy of different
vaccines [8], and as yet unclear duration of immunity [14-16] are critical determinants of the
level of herd immunity needed to control COVID-19. Depending on these variables, herd
immunity needed to control COVID-19 varies widely from 50-100% [3,8].
Using a rat model of population-wide COVID-19 transmission, we assessed viral shedding and
disease transmission following re-infection in naturally exposed or vaccinated seropositive
individuals. Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) is a highly infectious rat betacoronavirus [17,18]
that infects the upper respiratory tract [19], salivary and lacrimal glands [20,21] and lung [2123]. Like SARS CoV-2 [24-28], SDAV infection can be transmitted by asymptomatically
infected individuals [29] via airborne, direct contact, or fomite routes [17].
Beginning with a defined SDAV inoculum, we modeled heterogeneous viral exposure in a
naturally infected population using a range of high (inoculation and direct contact) and low
(fomite) risk exposures. Previously exposed animals were then re-exposed to SDAV to
determine the role of naturally acquired immunity in subsequent viral shedding and transmission
to naïve animals. Shedding and transmission from naturally infected re-exposed animals was
compared to that in animals vaccinated with Parker’s Rat Coronavirus (RCV), a closely related
coronavirus [30,31].
We used the two most widely used measures of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing [32] and serology [33] to examine the relationships
between exposure routes, seroconversion and viral shedding.

Materials and Methods
Virus amplification and quantification: SDAV was isolated at Yale in 1976. Stocks of SDAV
were generated in L2p176 cells [34,35]. Briefly, confluent L2.p176 cells were pretreated for 1
hour with 75ug/ml of DEAE-D in 75% DMEM 25% L15 media. Cells were incubated with virus
diluted in 75% DMEM 25% L15 with trypsin for 1 hour and cell/media was harvested at 3 days
post-infection. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay [34]. Briefly, 6 well plates of
L2p176 cells were pretreated with 75ug/ml DEAE-D in 75% DMEM/25% L15 media for 3
hours. Cells were rinsed with PBS and inoculated with 10- fold dilutions of virus in 75%
DMEM/25% L15 with 75ug/ml DEAE-D and trypsin. One hour later, inocula was removed, cells
were rinsed with PBS and were overlaid with 0.55% Seaplaque agarose/minimal media/trypsin.
Three days post-inoculation, cells were fixed with formalin, agarose was removed and plaques
were visualized with Giemsa.
Animals and housing: Seven-week old female and male SAS outbred Sprague-Dawley rats (150250g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were
housed (separated by sex) in Tecniplast (West Chester, PA) individually ventilated cages
(GR900 for rats) that provide high microbial biocontainment. Sentinel animals were placed on
each side of the rack and tested every 3 months for antibodies to rodent pathogens, including
SDAV, with consistently seronegative results. Rooms were maintained at 72oC on an evenly split
light cycle (7AM:7PM). Animals were housed on corncob bedding, had access to autoclaved
pellets (2018S, Envigo, Somerset, NJ) and acidified water ad lib, and were acclimated for 5-7
days prior to infection. Animals were individually identified using ear tags. These were regularly
inspected and replaced as needed. Viral inoculation and animal handling was performed in a
Class II biosafety cabinet. All exposure groups were separated by sex. All animal work was
conducted under an approved Yale Animal Use and Care Committee protocol. Yale University
is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
Anesthesia, viral inoculation and euthanasia: Rats were anesthetized briefly using the open drop
method (isoflurane: propylene glycol 30% v/v). Intranasal inoculation of 2X10e4 plaque-forming
units (pfu) SDAV or 1X10e3 pfu RCV in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) was
performed in a total volume of 50µl per animal (25 µl per nostril). Animals were fully recovered

within 2-3 minutes of inoculation. At the end of reinfection and transmission experiments,
animals were euthanized using 70% carbon dioxide.
Initial infection with SDAV (Figure 1A): Four exposure groups were defined for initial SDAV
infection:
a. Inoculated rats (n=19, 47% female). Animals were inoculated intranasally with 2X10e4
pfu SDAV in 50µl DMEM, followed by individual housing in a clean cage for 48 hours.
b. Direct contact (n=31, 48% female): Naïve animals (1-3 animals) were placed with one
inoculated rat in a new clean cage 48 hours post inoculation. After 24 hours, exposed rats
were separated from the inoculated rat placed in a new clean cage.
c. Fomite contact animals (n=55; 53% female). Naïve animals (2-3 animals) were placed in
a dirty cage (containing contaminated bedding, furniture, food and water nipple) that had
been inhabited by an inoculated rat for 48 days post inoculation. After 24 hours, exposed
rats were relocated to a new clean cage in small groups of 2-3 animals (fomite
cohabitation group; n=30; 53% female) or singly (fomite single group; n=25; 52%
female).
d. Mock (n=10): A control group (n=10; 50% female) was inoculated with DMEM alone.
Oral swabs were taken on day 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 post-exposure on all animals (thus inoculated rats
began this process 96 hours before other exposure groups). Each animal was weighed on its day
of viral exposure and on every day on which oral swabs were taken. Gloves and equipment were
sterilized with 200ppm MB-10 between each animal. Health checks were performed daily for 10
days post-exposure. Animals were bled 6 weeks after their 10-day initial exposure period to
assess seroconversion.
Reinfection with SDAV (Figure 1B): After initial exposure, animals assumed either seronegative
(n=66) or seropositive status (n=40). Within these two serologically distinct groups, those rats
that had originally received intranasal infection with SDAV (inoculated rats) were re-infected
intranasally again with the same viral dose (n=18). A subset of seronegative rats (n=18) received
intranasal inoculations to provide a source of infection for remaining animals. Remaining
animals were randomly assigned direct contact, fomite contact-cohabitation, and fomite contactsingly housed groups for their second exposure. Exposure and testing paradigms were identical
to those described for initial reinfection. Time between initial and second exposure ranged from

113-165 days. Animals were euthanized at 10 days post infection (dpi) and assessed for
seroconversion.
Assessing transmission of SDAV to naïve rats by previously SDAV infected rats (Figure 2A):
Our aim was to determine whether animals that had been previously exposed to a known dose of
SDAV could transmit SDAV to naïve rats following re-exposure after 4-5 months. Inoculated
rats that had received an initial dose of 2X10e4 pfu SDAV, and had subsequently shed virus and
seroconverted, received a second similar intranasal inoculation 113-165 days later. These
animals were placed in a clean cage with naïve rats 48 hours post inoculation (direct contact
paradigm). After 24 hours, exposed naïve rats were separated from the inoculated rat and placed
in a new clean cage. Body weights and oral swabs were taken on both groups of animals at 2, 3,
4, 7 and 10 dpi, followed by serologic testing of naïve animals.
Modeling vaccination using RCV (Figure 2 B, C): First, we performed a dose-finding study to
assess the dose of Parker's rat coronavirus (RCV) that would impart protection to subsequent
challenge with SDAV (Supp Data 1). Three groups of male rats (n=3/group) were inoculated
with 10e3, 10e4 or 10e5 pfu RCV in 50 µl of DMEM. Seroconversion was confirmed in all 2
weeks after inoculation. Two weeks later, all animals were challenged with intranasal 2X10e4
pfu SDAV (50 µl). Low viral shedding (Cq 30.5-30.7 cycles for one day only over a 10-day
period) was noted in only two animals at the higher RCV inoculation groups (10e4 or 10e5 pfu
RCV). Based on these data, a dose of 10e3 RCV pfu RCV in 50 µl of DMEM was selected for
the vaccination study. Eight-week-old naïve male and female SD rats were inoculated
intranasally either once (n=12; Figure 2B) or twice with a month interval between inoculations
(n=12; Figure 2C). Seroconversion was confirmed one month after the first inoculation.
Assessing transmission of SDAV to naïve rats by RCV vaccinated rats (Figure 2 B, C): Next, we
tested whether animals that had been previously vaccinated with RCV could transmit SDAV to
naïve rats at all. Rats vaccinated with one or two doses of RCV were challenged by intranasal
inoculation with 2X10e4 pfu SDAV in 50 µl of DMEM 6 weeks after their last RCV exposure.
After 48 hours, one SDAV-inoculated rat was co-housed with one naïve rat for 7 days. Body
weights and oral swabs were taken on both groups of animals at 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 dpi, followed
by serologic testing of naïve animals at 10 dpi. Animals were evenly allocated by sex.

Assessing oral shedding by semi-quantitative RT-PCR: Rats were swabbed orally using sterile
flocked swabs (Hydraflock, Puritan Medical Products, Guilford, ME) to confirm viral shedding
by quantitative RT-PCR. 600 ul of RLT buffer (Qiagen) was added to each swab and the sample
was vortexed. 350 ul of 70% ethanol was added to 350 ul of lysed sample in RLT and the
mixture was transferred to the RNeasy mini column. RNA was extracted following the
manufacturer’s instructions and RNA was eluted from the column with 50 ul of RNase-free
water. 2.5 ul of RNA was amplified using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green One Step kit (Biorad)
and the following primers (SD29629:AGAAAACGCCGGTAGCAGAA and
SD30197:CCTTCCCGAGCCTTCAACAT) using a Biorad CFX Connect Real-time System.
The reaction conditions were 10 min at 50C; 5 min at 95C; and 40 cycles of 10 sec at 95C, 20
sec at 59.1C and 36 sec at 72C. All assays contained negative and positive controls. PCR
positivity was defined as a rat having a Cq of < 40 for at least 1 observation
Serology: 10 days to six weeks after exposure to SDAV or RCV, animals were bled to assess
seroconversion. Animals were restrained in a hand towel and bled from the saphenous vein
following shaving, alcohol disinfection of skin, application of sterile petroleum lubricant to
create a hydrophobic surface, and single puncture with a 20G needle. Drops of blood were
collected in a serum separator tube, spun at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes, and serum withdrawn for
storage at -20oC. Sera was tested for coronaviral antibodies using an indirect
immunofluorescence assay [36]. Briefly 20 ul of sera diluted tenfold in PBS was placed on a
glass slide containing fixed L2p176 cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain S. Bound rat
antibodies were detected with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Data analysis and statistics: Descriptive statistics were conducted using t-tests, non-parametric
tests of medians, and chi-squares tests for proportions where appropriate with data analyzed
using regression models. Continuous outcomes (e.g Cq or body weight) used standard linear
models with an autoregressive covariance parameter to control for the repeated measurements
within animal while count outcomes used Poisson regression with a log-link.

Results
Initial infection with SDAV (Table 1): Body weight, viral shedding and seroconversion were
compared across exposure modes.
Body weight: Compared to mock-inoculated animals, SDAV-inoculated rats experienced
declines in weight gain at days 2-4 post infection (Supplementary Fig 1). Weight gain slowed
during days 2 – 4 regardless of exposure mode; however, only inoculated rats gained
significantly less quickly than mock inoculated control animals (p<.001). Male and female rats
experienced no significant difference in growth rates. Apart from transient porphyrin staining of
eyes lasting less than 24 hours in 5 rats, no other clinical signs were noted. These data are
consistent with clinically asymptomatic to mild infection across all virus exposed groups.
Viral shedding: All SDAV-inoculated rats and those exposed via direct contact tested PCR
positive on oral swabs (Table 1), with declining proportions of PCR-positivity in fomite –
exposed animals that were co-housed (73.3%) or singly housed (24%), suggesting that
subsequent rat-rat transmission occurred in co-housed animals. Route of exposure significantly
influenced amount of viral shedding (p<0.0001; Supplementary Figure 2). The extent of viral
shedding did not differ between inoculated and direct contact groups. Compared to shedding in
inoculated rats, viral shedding following fomite exposure was significantly lower (p< .0001)
Route of exposure significantly influenced duration of viral shedding (defined as the number of
observations, in days, where shedding was present; p<0.0001; Supplementary Figure 3).
Inoculated and direct exposure groups shed virus for approximately twice as long as fomite
exposed animals (significant at p<0.0001 for fomite-cohabitation group only). Inoculated and
direct contact animals shed virus from 2-4 days post inoculation, with few animals shedding at
day 7 and none at day 10. Fomite exposed animals shed intermittently; however, shedding more
commonly persisted to 10 dpi (Supplementary Figure 4). Consistency of shedding was
significantly affected by exposure mode (p<.0001), with inoculated and direct exposure groups
shedding with significantly greater consistency than fomite-cohabitation (p<.0001) and fomite
single groups (p<.0001). These data indicate that inoculated and direct contact animals shed
higher amounts of virus more consistently in the first 3 days post exposure. In contrast, fomiteexposed animals shed lower amounts of virus at intermittently for a more protracted period.

Seroconversion: All SDAV-inoculated rats and those exposed via direct contact seroconverted.
Seroconversion declined in cohabiting and singly housed fomite-exposed animals (50% and 8%
respectively). These two exposure groups also experienced discordant results between PCR
testing and seroconversion (Table 1). These data indicate that viral shedding detectable by PCR
does not invariably result in seroconversion. Similarly, because viral shedding is intermittent, a
negative PCR test does not rule out the potential of infection sufficient to induce an immune
response. However, seroconversion was significantly associated with greater amounts
(p<0.0001) and duration (p<0.0001) of viral shedding. (Supplementary Fig 5). Sex did not
significantly affect viral shedding amount, duration or seroconversion.
Re-infection with SDAV: Rats were aged for 113-165 days before reinfection with SDAV by
inoculation, direct contact or fomite exposure (Table 2). In contrast to initial infection, no
significant effect on body weight was noted regardless of mode of infection or serologic status.
Amount of viral shedding (expressed as lowest observed Cq) was significantly influenced by
both exposure mode (p<.01) and serologic status (p<.001; Figure 3A). Similarly, duration of
shedding was significantly influenced by both exposure mode (p<.05) and serologic status
(p<.001; Figure 3B).
Previously SDAV-exposed seropositive rats shed less virus (p<.001) for a shorter period (p
<.001) compared to previously mock-inoculated seronegative rats when re-inoculated with the
same dose of SDAV. Proportions infected among SDAV inoculated rats differed significantly
(P<.0001) between seronegative (100%) and seropositive rats (38.9%). This clearly
demonstrates protective immunity (that did not however eliminate viral shedding) on reinfection
with the same virus and same dose.
To investigate the differential role of exposure mode on amount of viral shedding, rats were
stratified by serological status (Table 2). Among seronegative rats, exposure mode significantly
affected amount (p<.001) and duration (p < .0001) of viral shedding. Compared to seronegative
SDAV-inoculated rats, direct contact rats shed less virus (p=.06) for a shorter period of time
(p<0.001) Fomite cohabitation animals shed less virus (p<.01) for a shorter period of time
(p<0.001). The fomite single group was excluded from analysis due to low sample size (n=4).
Among seronegative animals, as with initial infection, the amount and duration of viral shedding

was dictated by exposure mode; however, direct contact rats appeared to shed less virus and for
less time than on initial infection.
In seropositive animals, immunity obtained from prior SDAV exposure via a variety of routes
altered this pattern. Direct and fomite cohabitating rats experienced higher levels of shedding
than the SDAV-inoculated seropositive rats previously exposed to SDAV via the same route,
implying greater protection against shedding in the latter. Despite this observation, the amount of
viral shedding was not significantly associated with exposure mode (p=.09). In contrast,
exposure mode was significantly (p<.01) associated with duration of shedding. SDAVinoculated rats generally shed for fewer observations, and significantly fewer observations than
the direct contact group (p<.05). These data indicate that immunity obtained via direct contact or
fomite exposure was largely protective regardless of how it was obtained, but that heterogeneity
in protection against duration of shedding was imparted by route of re-exposure.
Viral transmission by SDAV reinfected or RCV vaccinated rats (Table 3): In the previous
experiment, we established that the majority (59%) of seropositive animals could shed virus,
albeit at low levels, on re-exposure. Next, we explored whether such animals could transmit
infection to naïve animals. First, we assessed whether rats reinfected with SDAV via the same
route (intranasal inoculation of 2X10e4 pfu/animal) could transmit the virus to naïve animals
using the same 24-hour direct contact exposure paradigm employed in our previous experiments.
The time-period between initial SDAV infection and reinfection was 113-140 days, thus
modeling shedding on re-exposure after several months. The same experiment was repeated
following one or two doses of RCV given one month apart. In this experiment, direct contact
exposure times were lengthened to 7 days to determine if SDAV transmission could occur at all.
Following SDAV inoculation, no significant differences in number of animals shedding virus,
amount of virus shed or duration of shedding were noted across vaccine groups, indicating that
one or two doses provided equivalent protection. Transmission was defined in two ways 1) if the
target rats exhibited shedding on any observation and 2) if the target rat seroconverted.
Transmission rates from the SDAV reinfected (n=13) and RCV vaccinated rats (n=21, collapsing
1 and 2 doses) were compared to each other and to a reference group consisting of the previously
described rats in direct contact with SDAV naïve rats (n=31) using chi-square tests. Regardless
if shedding or seroconversion was treated as the metric of transmission, proportions in the both

SDAV reinfected source group (3/13, shedding and seroconversion) and RCV vaccinated group
(3/21, shedding; 1/21, seroconversion) were significantly lower than the SDAV naïve direct
contact reference group (31/31, shedding and seroconversion), p<.001 in both cases. However,
the proportions did not differ between SDAV reinfected and RCV vaccinated SDAV exposed
rats (shedding p=.65; seroconversion, p=.27).
These data indicate that low levels of viral shedding can occur in previously infected and
vaccinated animals on SDAV re-exposure and challenge respectively. These levels, while low,
can result in transmission, even in the period following vaccination, when immunity is likely to
be the highest. However, rates of transmission by previously infected and vaccinated animals are
far lower than those seen with initial infection.
Discussion
The extent to which humans with natural or vaccine-induced immunity who are re-exposed to
SARS-CoV-2 can shed virus is only just emerging [12]. Immunity following natural infection is
likely to be variable [13]. Vaccine-induced immune protection is more homogenous [37,38],
however efficacy varies across different vaccines [8] and is likely to be impacted by newly
emerging variants [39,40]. This immunologic heterogeneity may promote persistent viral
transmission and continued disease in remaining susceptible individuals. A key issue is whether
low amounts of shed virus can achieve transmission [41]. Using a rat model of respiratory
coronaviral infection, we modeled viral shedding and transmission in a population exposed via
routes varying from high (inoculation and direct contact) to low (fomite) exposure risk. Of
particular interest was the extent to which heterogeneous immune protection afforded by prior
exposure influenced the amount of virus shed on re-exposure, and whether these low amounts of
shed virus could infect naïve animals.
SDAV is a highly infectious rat betacoronavirus [17,18] that infects the upper respiratory tract
[19], lacrimal glands [20,21] and lung [21-23], and results in transient mild to asymptomatic
disease. SDAV infects salivary glands [21], a capacity recently demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2
[42]. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SDAV can persist on hard surfaces for up to 28 days [27,43] and 2
days [44] respectively. Like SARS CoV-2 [24-28], SDAV infection can be transmitted by
asymptomatically infected individuals [29] via airborne, direct contact or fomite routes [17].

Consequently, SDAV is well suited to model viral transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in
asymptomatic people [24], the predominant means of community spread.
On initial infection, animals exposed via all routes experienced transient declines in growth rate,
consistent with mild to asymptomatic disease. This was significant only in inoculated rats, who
received a known (and presumably highest) infective dose. Like SARS-CoV-2, viral shedding
peaked early in the first week after exposure [45], however duration of viral shedding (3-10
days) in SDAV infection was shorter than the reported mean of 17.5 days in the upper
respiratory tract of SARS-CoV2 infected patients [45]. Amount and duration of viral shedding
was significantly influenced by route of exposure, and was highest in inoculated and direct
contact groups, and lowest fomite groups. Fomite transmission was amplified by subsequent
cohabitation of rats. Conflicting data exist regarding the risk of fomite transmission in SARSCoV-2 [27,46]. Our data indicate that while comparatively low, this route represents a clear
source of transmission risk in that can be amplified by close contact such as dense co-housing
conditions.
As in the human population, the viral dose that resulted in infection of an individual cannot be
directly measured in natural exposure settings. However, higher infectious doses of SARS-CoV2 are implicated in higher risk of transmission [47], and infectious dose is assumed to be much
higher in direct contact compared to fomite settings, corresponding to respective high and low
transmission risk of these exposure types [48,49]. Similarly, higher viral loads in COVID-19
patients are associated with more reliable seroconversion [50]. Our results are consistent with
these data and imply that higher viral exposure results in a greater amount and duration of viral
shedding, and more consistent seroconversion. Conversely, low viral load accompanying with
fomite exposure may result in a positive viral PCR test but fail to elicit an antibody response.
Following initial infection with SDAV, we generated a population of seronegative and
seropositive animals. Within this latter group, 59% of animals shed virus for some period on reexposure, although at lower levels than in initial infection. Those animals with the highest
confirmed viral exposure on initial infection and re-infection (i.e. intranasal inoculation for both
exposures) had significantly lower viral shedding for a shorter period than all other reinfection
groups. The remaining seropositive rats achieved their status through initial exposure via direct
contact or fomite exposure where viral dose was unknown, but presumably lower than that used

for direct inoculation. On reinfection via one of these routes, re-exposed rats shed virus for a
longer period of time, indicating that their protective immunity was lower than that induced by
intranasal inoculation. These results indicate that seropositive status following initial infection
reduces but does not eliminate viral shedding on re-exposure after 3.7-5.5 months. Moreover,
immune protection in seropositive individuals appears to be heterogeneous. The extent to which
humans shed SARS-CoV-2 on reinfection, and associated risk of transmission is emerging [51].
Shedding rates on reinfection in our model are much higher than those reported for SARS-CoV-2
[9]. This may reflect a true biological difference between SDAV and SARS-CoV-2. However,
our entire population was re-exposed within a defined time-period and shedding then assessed by
timed repeated PCR testing, thus maximizing the likelihood of detecting shedding. Re-exposure
events in a human population are rarely known, thus precluding coordination of testing with the
exposure event. Therefore, the actual shedding on re-exposure in human populations may be
higher than reported.
Next, we assessed the risk of transmission by animals shedding low amounts of virus. Consistent
with prior studies [52,53], rats reinfected with SDAV via the same route (intranasal inoculation
given 113-140 days apart) were able to induce viral shedding and/or seroconversion in 25% of
naïve contact rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Observed cycle threshold values in
reinfected source rats ranged from 29-34 cycles with short shedding durations (1-2 days). In
SARS-CoV-2, live viral shedding can be inferred from cycle threshold (Cq) values on PCR
testing [45] of shedding individuals. Live viral culture positivity declines with increasing cycle
threshold values [54]. Cycle threshold values of 33-34 reflect low enough live viral shedding to
render patients non-contagious [25,54,55]. These reports are consistent with our findings.
However, it should be noted that in all three instances where naïve recipient rats seroconverted,
viral shedding by SDAV re-infected rats was not detected, implying that shedding sufficient for
transmission can occur for short periods that may escape detection. While both SARS-CoV-2
[42] and SDAV infect salivary glands and can be detected in the oral cavity, we recognize that
oral swabs in our rats may not have detected shedding via other routes e.g. nasal shedding.
Implications for COVID-19 are that naturally infected seropositive individuals may represent a
source of ongoing transmission on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Finally, we assessed transmission by animals exposed to SDAV shortly after vaccination with
Parker's Rat Coronavirus (RCV), a betacoronaviruses that is closely related to SDAV [31]. RCV
infection can be used to model vaccination in our model using a live virus strategy. In prior
studies, infection with RCV results in cross-protective seroconversion, and disease protection
following subsequent SDAV infection [56]. While a significant proportion of vaccinated animals
(11/24) shed SDAV at low amounts (range 29.5-36 cycles), they achieved transmission in only
one recipient after 7 days of direct contact exposure. These results indicate that protection
against transmission after reinfection in the immediate post vaccination period is superior to that
several months after natural infection. We did not test whether this protection would decline over
months at the same rate as that afforded by SDAV inoculation, however some decline is
expected from previous studies [56]. Data from both groups taken together imply that cycle
threshold (Cq) values above 29 are associated with transmission, but that PCR detection of oral
shedding alone is not a reliable predictor of transmission risk.
In conclusion, shedding and seroconversion following initial natural SDAV infection was
heterogeneous and influenced by route of exposure. Viral shedding occurred in the majority
seropositive individuals exposed to SDAV after natural infection or vaccination, however
amount and duration of shedding was much lower than on initial exposure. Nevertheless, low
viral shedding by these animals was able to result in transmission to susceptible individuals after
close contact. If these data are extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it appears that viral
shedding and transmission by previously infected or vaccinated individuals could prolong
transition to stable endemic status. This transition could be impacted by emergence of more
transmissible variants. Protection of susceptible individuals would best be achieved by
vaccination rather than relying on protection by herd immunity.

A. Initial infection with SDAV: Naïve animals were inoculated intranasally with 2X10e4 pfu
SDAV. After 48 hours, one inoculated (index) animal was placed in a clean cage with naïve
animals for 24 hours (direct contact). Naïve animals were placed in a dirty cage that had been
inhabited by an index rat (fomite) for 24 hours. After 24 hours, all rats were relocated to new
clean cages to constitute four groups: index, or inoculated rats, direct exposure rats, and two
fomite exposure groups – a fomite cohabitation group constituting 2-3 animals, and a fomite
single group with only one animal. Oral swabs were taken on Day 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 postexposure on all animals, and serology performed 5-6 weeks later. A control group (not shown)
was inoculated with DMEM alone, and similarly swabbed and bled. After initial exposure,
animals assumed either seronegative or seropositive status. All groups were evenly split by
sex.
B. Reinfection with SDAV: Naïve seronegative rats received intranasal 2X10e4 pfu SDAV to
provide a source of infection. Seropositive and seronegative animals were randomly assigned
direct contact, fomite contact-cohabitation, and fomite contact-singly housed contact groups
for their second exposure (Table 2 and Figure 1B). Rats that had originally received intranasal
infection with SDAV (index rats) were re-infected intranasally again with the same viral dose.
Time between initial and second exposure ranged from 113-165 days. Oral swabs were taken
on Day 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 post-exposure on all animals. Animals were sacrificed at 10 dpi and
assessed for seroconversion. All groups were evenly split by sex.

A. Transmission of SDAV to naïve rats by previously SDAV infected rats: Index rats that
had received an initial dose of 2X10e4 pfu SDAV, and had subsequently shed virus and
seroconverted, received a second similar intranasal inoculation 112-140 days later (n=12).
After 48 hours, these animals were placed in a clean cage with naïve rats (n=12; direct
contact paradigm). After 24 hours, exposed naïve rats were separated from the inoculated rat
and placed in a new clean cage. Body weights and oral swabs were taken on both groups of
animals at 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 dpi. Animals were sacrificed at 10 dpi and assessed for
seroconversion. All groups were evenly split by sex.
B. Transmission of SDAV to naïve rats by RCV (1 dose) vaccinated rats: Eight-week-old
naïve rats (n=12) were inoculated intranasally with 1X10e3 pfu RCV and assessed for
seroconversion 4 weeks later. Two weeks after confirmed serologic status, animals were
challenged with 2X10e4 pfu SDAV. After 48 hours, these animals were co-housed in a clean
cage with a naïve rat (n=12) for 7 days. Body weights and oral swabs were taken on both
groups of animals at 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 dpi. Animals were sacrificed at 10 dpi and assessed for
seroconversion. All groups were evenly split by sex.

Figure 3. Viral shedding on SDAV re-exposure.
A. Amount of viral shedding (expressed as lowest observed Cq) by serologic status and exposure
mode. Amount of viral shedding was significantly influenced by both exposure mode (p< .01)
and serologic status (p<.001) using linear regression. Previously SDAV-exposed seropositive
rats shed less virus (p <.001) compared to previously mock-inoculated seronegative rats. Among
seronegative rats, exposure mode significantly affected amount (p < .001) of viral shedding.
Compared to seronegative SDAV-inoculated rats, direct contact (p=.06) and fomite cohabitation
animals(p<.01) shed less virus. Among seropositive rats, direct and fomite cohabitating rats
experienced higher levels of shedding than the SDAV-inoculated seropositive rats, implying
greater protection against shedding in the latter. Despite this observation, the amount of viral
shedding was not significantly associated with exposure mode (p=.09). Red diamonds indicate
group means. Contrasts are marked by asterisks; * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.

*Seropositive group: Animals given SDAV 2X10e4 pfu on initial infection were reinfected via
the same route. All other animals were randomized between initial and subsequent routes of
infection and were exposed to naïve animals given SDAV 2X10e4 pfu via direct contact or
fomite exposure.
**Seronegative group: Animals given SDAV 2X10e4 pfu reinfection were previously mock
infected controls or naïve purchased animals. All other animals were exposed to naïve animals
inoculated with SDAV 2X10e4 pfu via direct contact or fomite exposure.
- Seropositive animals were not re-tested for seroconversion after reinfection
Cq=quantification cycle. Only animals with viral shedding (Cq<40 cycles) are included in Cq
and shedding time calculations. Observation time points comprised post-exposure days 2, 3, 4 ,7,
