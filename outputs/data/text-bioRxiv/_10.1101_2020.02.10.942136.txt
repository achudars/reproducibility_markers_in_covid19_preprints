Abstract
During its first month, the recently emerged 2019 Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already
infected many thousands of people in mainland China and worldwide and took hundreds of lives.
However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research
community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the
experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a
vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our
knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public
databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a
comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these
information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS
coronavirus. All data are made publicly available to the research community at http://korkinlab.org/wuhan

Introduction
Within month and a half, since it was first discovered in Wuhan, China, the novel deadly Coronavirus,
2019-nCov, has infected more than 37,000, with the death toll already surpassing that of the 2003 SARS
epidemic [1-3]. In spite of the world-wide efforts by scientific community to swiftly address this health
crisis, the vaccines may be months and even years away [4, 5]. For instance, a Phase I trial of a vaccine
for a closely related 2019-nCov, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, was announced in
December 2004, after two years of the disease outbreak [6]. And a vaccine for Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS), another coronavirus that emerged in 2012, was patented in 2019, with the Phase I
trials introduced in the same year [7, 8]. Nevertheless, in the past two decades, a massive amount of work
has been done to understand the molecular basis of the coronavirus infection and evolution, develop
effective treatment in forms of both vaccines and antiviral drugs, and propose efficient measures for viral
detection and prevention [9-18]. Structures of many individual proteins of SARS, MERS, and related
coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins have been
explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds [16, 19-31].

However, experimental data of the same scale for 2019-nCov may take years to obtain by the research
community. Can it be facilitated? The answer lies in the use of the modern bioinformatics methods that
can drastically streamline knowledge discovery by quickly providing the important insights about
possible molecular mechanisms behind the infection, pinpointing the likely protein targets for the antiviral treatments, and predicting the efficacy of the existing antivirals developed for other coronaviruses.
By leveraging the previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structure and
function, bioinformaticians have been successfully helping the virologists by structurally characterizing
proteins of novel viruses, determining the evolutionary trajectories, identifying interactions with host
proteins, and providing other important biological insights. In particular, a plethora of results has been
achieved through comparative, or homology, modeling principles [32, 33]. In addition to the global

structural genomics initiatives focusing on determining the 3D structures of proteins on a genome scale
[34] and specific efforts on rapid structural characterization of proteins in emerging viruses [35-38],
multiple works have used comparative modeling to predict the structures of protein-protein interaction
complexes [39-41], facilitating structure-based drug discovery [33, 42, 43], inferring protein functions
[44], determining the macromolecular interaction network [45-47], and providing molecular insights into
viral evolution [48-50].

Here, using an integrated bioinformatics approach, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and
interactomics analysis of the Wuhan 2019-nCov virus. The structural information on the individual
2019-nCov proteins and their interactions with each other and with the human proteins allows to
accurately determine the putative functional sites. These functional sites, combined with the evolutionary
sequence analysis of 2019-nCov as well as the closely related human SARS and bat coronavirus
proteomes, provide us with a structure-based view of the evolutionary diversity of 2019-nCov, allow to
estimate how similar the functioning of 2019-nCov virus is when compared with SARS, and forecast how
likely the antibodies and candidate ligands that are efficient in inhibiting the SARS functions will be
efficient in doing the same for 2019-nCov.

Results
The recently sequenced genomes of 2019-nCoV strains combined with the comparative analysis of the
SARS genome organization and transcription allowed to determine the tentative list of gene products
[51]. It has been suggested that 2019-nCoV has 16 predicted non-structural proteins (that are referred to
as wNsp1-wNsp16 here) constituting a polyprotein (wORF1ab), followed by (at least) 13 downstream
ORFs: Surface, ORF3a, ORF3b, Envelope, Membrane, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid,
ORF9a, ORF9b, and ORF10 that we refer in this work as wS, wORF3a, wORF3b, wE, wM, wORF6,
wORF7a, wORF7b, wORF8, wN, wORF9a, wORF9b, and wORF10, correspondingly. The three viral

species whose proteins shared the highest similarity were consistently the same: human SARS (SARSCov), bat coronavirus (BtCoV), as well as another bat betacoronavirus (BtRf-BetaCoV).

Comparative analysis of 2019-nCoV proteins with the evolutionary related coronavirus proteins reveals
unevenly distributed large genomic insertions
Searching against UniProt database [52] resulted in matches for the polyprotein (wORF1ab), all four
structural proteins (wS, wE, wM, and wN), and six ORFs (wORF3a, wORF6, wORF7a, wORF7b,
wORF8, and wORF10) also referred to as accessory proteins. The closest protein matches from UniProt
shared sequence identity with the related 2019-nCoV proteins as high as 91% (with wORF1ab and wN)
and as low as 57% (withwORF8) (Supl. Table S1). The majority of differences were the single-residue
substitutions spread across the protein sequence (see multiple sequence alignment files for all protein in
Suppl. Materials).

Perhaps the most profound differences lie in the sequences of the multi-domain protein wNsp3 and
surface protein wS: our analysis revealed that compared to the related coronavirus proteins (multiple
sequence alignments for both proteins can be found in Suppl. Materials) the two proteins had large
sequence inserts. In particular, wNsp3 had a novel large (25 - 41 res., depending on the alignment
method) insert between its two putative functional domains homologous to N-terminal domain and
adenosine diphosphate ribose 1″ phosphatase (ADRP) of SARS [53, 54] (Suppl. Materials). Interestingly,
the closest matching peptide, apart from the virus itself, was found in C-Jun-amino-terminal kinaseinteracting protein 4 (Seq. id is 46%) of Labrus bergylta, a species of marine ray finned fish. Being
significantly more diverse than the other three structural proteins, wS was found to have 4 inserts (4-6
res.) that seemed unique to 2019-nCoV and two additional inserts shared with human SARS proteins
(Suppl. Materials).

Three recent strains of bat SARS-like coronavirus from 2013, 2015, and 2017 share extremely high
proteome similarity with 2019-nCoV
The unusually low conservation of ORF6, ORF8, and surface proteins between 2019-nCoV and human
SARS, bat coronavirus, as well as another bat betacoronavirus BtRf-BetaCoV, prompted us to perform an
expanded search for ORF8 homologs using NCBI BLAST’s blatp tool against a large non-redundant
protein sequences repository (nr) [55]. Our search resulted in three new homologs of ORF8 from three
different isolates of bat SARS-like coronavirus: bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank ID: MG772933, collected in
2017), bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank ID: MG772934, collected in 2015), and RaTG13 (GenBank ID:
MN996532, collected in 2013) that shared a striking similarity with wORF8, unseen in other strains
before: the sequence identities between each of these three homologs and wORF8 ranged between the 94
and 95%. Further analysis showed that the proteomes of these isolates shared even higher sequence
identity with the other proteins of 2019-nCoV: from 88.4% to 100% for 2015 and 2017 isolates, and even
higher 97.4%-100% for the 2013 isolate (Supl. Table S1).

In spite of the significant similarity of the three isolates to 2019-nCoV, important differences were
observed. First, similar to other viruses, the 2017 and 2015 isolates did not have the four sequence inserts
that were found in wS. Second, neither of the two isolate had the large insert between the tow domain of
wNsp3 of wORF1ab described above. On the contrary, the 2013 isolate had both, the four sequence
inserts in its surface protein, matching those in wS and the large insert in Nsp3 although the sequence is
different from that one in wNsp3. The main difference between 2019-nCoV and 2013 isolate is the lack of
Orf10 in the latter: while genomic sequences of both 2015 and 2017 isolates can be translated into a
protein product that shares 97.4% of sequence identity (Supl. Table S1), because of a single nucleotide
deletion in that region one cannot translate a full-length ORF10 in RaTG13: the resulting frameshift
causes a premature stop-codon when translating the sequence.

Next, as a result of a comprehensive comparative modeling effort, we were able to structurally
characterize 17 individual proteins, including 13 non-structural proteins of wORF1ab (wNsp1, wNsp3,
wNsp4, wNsp5, wNsp7, wNsp8, wNsp9, wNsp10, wNsp12, wNsp14, wNsp15, wNsp16), three structural
proteins (wE, wN, and wS), as well as one ORF (wORF7a). For two proteins, wNsp3 and wN, multiple
individual domains were modeled (Fig.1, Fig.2,). The templates for the majority models were
homologous protein structures from other coronaviruses, with a high target-to-template sequence
similarity (seq. ids: 75-96%, except for ORF8). For two proteins, wN and wNsp3, multiple domains were
modeled. N-terminal and C-terminal domains of wN correspond to N-terminal RNA-binding domain and
C-terminal dimerization domain of SARS, respectively. The modeled domains 1-6 of wNsp1 correspond
to (1) N-terminal domain; (2) adenosine diphosphate ribose 1″ phosphatase domain; (3) SUD domain
(SARS-specific unique domain) containing two macrodomains; (4) SUD domain C; (5) the papain-like
protease PLPro domain; and (6) Y domain of SARS (Fig. 1). A previously identified transmembrane
domain of SARS Nsp3 was mapped to the sequence of wNsp3, but could not be modeled due to the lack
of a template structure.

The structural analysis of the modeled proteins combined with the sequence conservation analysis
revealed several findings. First, we found that the mutated residues tend to locate on the protein’s surface,
supporting the previous observations in other families of RNA viruses that the core residues of viral
proteins are more conserved than the surface residues [48, 56, 57]. Furthermore, in a substantial number
of proteins, distributions of mutated positions exhibited spatial patterns, with groups of mutations found
to form clusters on the protein surfaces (Fig.2). These obtained models were then used as reference
structures to map and analyze the protein-binding and ligand-binding sites.

Next, using comparative modeling we structurally characterized protein interaction complexes, for both
intra-viral (homo- and hetero-oligomers) and host-viral interactions where host proteins were exclusively
human. In total, we obtained structural models for 16 homo-oligomeric complexes, three hetero6

oligomeric complexes, and eight human-virus interaction complexes (Fig. 3). The intra-viral heterooligomeric complexes included exclusively the interactions between the non-structural proteins (wNsp7,
wNsp8, wNsp10, wNsp12, wNsp14, and wNsp16). The modeled host-viral interaction complexes
included three types of interactions: nonstructural protein wNsp3 (papain-like protease, PLpro domain)
interacting with human ubiquitin-aldehyde, surface protein wS (in its trimeric form) interacting the human
receptor ACE3 in different conformations, as well as the same protein wS interacting with several
neutralizing antibodies. Based on the obtained models, the protein interaction binding sites were extracted
and analyzed with respect to their evolutionary conservation.

Evolutionary conservation and divergence of functional regions of 2019-nCoV
The analysis of the evolutionary conservation of protein binding sites revealed several patterns. First, we
found that all protein binding sites of non-structural proteins involving in the intra-viral heteromeric
complexes, wNSP7-wNsp8-wNsp12, wNsp10-wNsp14, and wNsp10-wNsp16, are either fully conserved
or allow at most one mutation on the periphery of the binding region, in spite of the fact that each proteins
had multiple mutations on their surfaces (Fig. 4A, see Suppl. Materials for the alignments of individual
proteins and annotation with the protein binding sites). Furthermore, we observed the same behavior
when analyzing the interaction between papain-like protease PLpro domain of wNsp3 and with human
ubiquitin-aldehyde (Fig. 4B, see Suppl. Materials): the only two mutated residues were located on a
border of the binding region and thus were unlikely to disrupt the protein-protein interaction.

The surface of wS presents a striking contrast to the majority of 2019-nCoV proteins due to its heavily
mutated surface (Fig. 3; see Suppl. Materials for the alignment of wS with the related proteins). First, the
four novel sequence inserts and two inserts shed with the closest strains were expected to affect the
protein’s function. Interestingly, three of the novel inserts are located in the first NTD domain, while the
fourth one is located immediately before the S2 cleavage site and inside the homo-trimerization

interaction interface. While the RBD domain of wS was not affected by those inserts it was the most
heavily mutated region of wS with the likely disruptive functional effects on the interactions with the
human ACE2 receptor and monoclonal antibodies mAb 396 [58] and mAb 80R [59] (Fig. 4B). The NTD
domain has been considered a target of another antibody Ab G2 previously shown to work in MERS [60].
However, based on the structural superposition of the NTD domain, it is likely that the expected
interaction will be disrupted by the novel sequence inserts to wS.

Finally, the analysis of seven ligand binding sites for multiple candidate inhibitors previously identified
for four proteins in SARS and MERS showed that many of the LBS were intact in the corresponding
2019-nCoV proteins (Fig. D, see Suppl. Materials for the alignments of individual proteins and annotation
with the ligand binding sites), such as wN, wNsp3, wNsp5, and wNsp16. For wNsp14, the ligand binding
site for several inhibitors was mutated while a co-localized binding site for another ligand was intact.

Joint intra-viral and human-virus protein-protein interaction network for SARS CoV indicates potential
system-wide roles of 2019-nCoV proteins
After constructing the individual networks of intra-viral interactions and virus-host interactions, they were
merged to form a unified network of SARS-CoV interactions, with the hypothesis that most interactions
could be conserved in 2019-nCoV (Fig. 6). The network analysis of all three networks showed that
unifying the intra-viral and virus-host networks reduces the number of components (islands) in the SARSCoV-Host interactome (Table 2). This suggested that the virus-host interactome map missed some viral
interactions that increased the number of components. The clustering coefficient and average node degree
were both higher in the unified interactome compared to the virus-host interactome.

The network topology of the unified interactome indicated the presence of several viral hubs for
structural, non-structural, as well as accessory proteins (Fig. 6). The viral proteins form all the hubs and
there are a few of specific interest. ORF9b is one of the largest hubs in the network thought to play a

secondary role only in intra-viral interactions and not necessary for replication [61], but a recent study has
shown that ORF9b hinders immunity by targeting the mitochondria and limits host cell responses [62].
NSP8 is the other major hub and interacts with other replicase proteins, including two other hubs, i.e.
NSP7 and NSP 12, which together play a crucial role in replication [63].

Another crucial non-structural protein is NSP1, also present in the 2019-nCoV, which is known to be a
primary disruptor of innate immunity. The host interaction partners of NSP1 modulate the
Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation [64]. Overexpression
of NSP1 is associated with immunopathogenecity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in
severe SARS cases. And inhibition of cyclophilins/immunopilins (host interaction partners) by
cyclosporine A (CspA) blocks the replication of CoVs of all genera.

There is an important interaction between the SARS spike protein (S) and the host angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), as it is associated with cross-species and human-to-human transmissions. The same
interaction is also inferred from structural modeling in 2019-nCoV between wS and ACE2, but might be
disrupted due to a substantial number of mutations in the receptor binding site of wS while another recent
study proposed that the interaction will be preserved [65]. Similar to SARS-CoV [66], wS protein in
2019-nCoV is expected to interact with type II transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) [67] and is likely to
be involved in inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, wS remains the important target for
vaccines and drugs previously evaluated in SARS and MERS while a neutralizing antibody targeting the
wS protein could provide passive immunity [68]. In addition, there are 7 interactions from SARS-CoV
determined from structural characterization of the protein complexes that are predicted to be either
conserved or potentially disrupted in 2019-nCoV (green edges in Fig. 1). An important target for vaccines
and drugs is the surface (S) protein which has been evaluated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with an idea
that a neutralizing antibody targeting wS protein could provide passive immunity for 2019-nCoV [68].
We also structurally modeled interactions between the 2019-nCoV wS protein and three human

monoclonal antibodies that were previously studied in SARS-CoV for immunotherapy and mapped the
information about the evolutionary conserved and diverse surface residues. We find that two interactions,
with mAb 396 [58] and mAb 80R [59], are likely to be disrupted due to the heavily mutated binding sites
while another one, Ab G2 [60], is likely to be disrupted due to a novel insert into the sequence of wS.
These findings may provide guidelines in the search of potential antibody candidates for treatment.

Discussion
This work provides an initial large-scale structural genomics and interactomics effort towards
understanding the structure, function, and evolution of the 2019-nCoV virus. The goal of this
computational work is two-fold. First, by making the structural road map and the related findings fully
available to the research community, we aim to facilitate the process of structure-guided research, where
accurate structural models of proteins and their interaction complexes already exist. Second, by providing
a comparative analysis between the new virus and its closest relatives from the perspective of protein- and
ligand-binding, we hope to help experimental scientists in their understanding of the molecular
mechanisms implicated in the infection by the new coronavirus as well as in the process of vaccine
development and antiviral drug discovery.

Through integrating the information on structure, function, and evolution in a comparative study of
2019-nCoV and the closely related coronaviruses, one can make several preliminary conclusions. First,
the extended peptide sequence newly introduced to wNsp3 between two structurally, and possibly
functionally, independent domains of this protein, might act as a long inter-domain linker, thus extending
the conformational flexibility of this multi-domain protein. Second, the presence of the four novel inserts
and one highly variable region of the surface protein wS and the analysis of this large-scale sequence
changes with respect to intra-viral and viral-host interaction leads us to conclude that these inserts might
have structural impact on the homo-trimeric form of the protein as well as the impact on the functions
carried out by NTD domain. Third, the structurally modelable repertoire of 2019-nCoV proteome also

pinpoints to the interesting targets for structural biology and hybrid methods. For instance, the whole
structures of the multi-domain proteins wN and wNsp3 could be resolved by integrating individual
models with the lower-resolution but whole-protein covering techniques such as cryogenic electron
microscopy (CryoEM). The structure of wNsp3 is especially interesting because of the presence of the
novel peptide introduced between the two structural domains of the protein.

The evolutionary analysis of the protein and ligand-binding sites mapped on the surfaces of 2019-nCoV
may provide new insights into the virus functioning and its future treatment. The 100% or near 100%
evolutionary conservation of the protein binding sites on the surfaces of nonstructural proteins wNsp7,
wNsp8, wNsp10, wNsp12, wNsp14, and wNsp16 that correspond to the intra-viral interactions for three
complexes is consistent with our previous observations that the intra-viral interactions are significantly
more conserved than viral-host interactions [48, 49, 69]. However the near-perfect conservation of the
human ubiquitin-aldehyde protein binding site on the surface of wNsp3 is rather intriguing suggesting the
critical role of this interaction in the functioning of SARS-like coronaviruses. Lastly, the conservation of
the ligand bind sites for many putative inhibitors previously developed for SARS and MERS suggests the
development of antiviral drugs as a promising direction for addressing this new global health threat.

Materials & Methods
The goal of this work is to identify the evolutionary differences between 2019-nCoV and the closest
coronavirus species, human SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronavirus, and to predict their
possible functional implications. To do so, we structurally characterize individual proteins as well as
intra-viral and human-virus protein complexes, extract the information on their interaction interfaces and
ligand binding, and superpose the evolutionary difference and conservation information with the binding
information. Specifically, our integrative computational pipeline will include the following five steps.

First, for each of the candidate 2019-nCoV proteins a set of sequentially similar coronavirus proteins is
determined and aligned. Second, structural models of 2019-nCoV proteins are obtained using templatebased, or homology, modeling. Third, the protein-protein interaction complex structures of 2019-nCoV
proteins interacting with each other and/or with the human proteins are determined using a multi-chain
comparative modeling protocol. Fourth, the protein-binding sites will be extracted from the obtained
models of protein-protein interaction complexes, and protein-ligand binding sites will be extracted from
the evolutionary close coronavirus protein-ligand templates and mapped to the relevant structural models
of 2019-nCoV through structural alignment. Fifth, the information on the evolutionary differences and
conservations observed between the protein sequences of 2019-nCoV and the related coronaviruses and
extracted from the above protein sequence alignments will mapped onto the structural models of the
2019-nCoV proteins to determine if the protein- and ligand-binding site are functionally conserved.
Lastly, a joint human-virus and virus-virus interactome is predicted through homology and analyzed. All
the obtained models and sequence alignments have been made publically available to the research
community.
Protein sequence data collection and analysis
Available sequences for protein candidates wS, wORF3a, wE, wM, wORF6, wORF7a, wORF7b,
wORF8, wN, and wORF10 have been extracted from NCBI Virus repository [70] (collected on January
29, 2019) and consequently used further in the sequence analysis and structural modeling (Suppl.
Materials). The Uniprot BLAST-based search was performed for each of the proteins using default
parameters. From the results of each search, the final selection was done based on the pairwise sequence
identity (>60%) as well as the relationship (Coronaviridae family). Each of 2019-nCoV proteins was then
aligned with the found related coronavirus proteins using a multiple sequence alignment method Clustal
Omega [71].

The structure of each protein has been determined using a single-template comparative modeling
protocols with MODELLER software package [72]. Frist, the template for each protein sequence has been
identified using a PSI-BLAST search in Protein Data Bank (PDB) [73]. In general, a structural template
with the highest sequence identity has been selected that covers at least 50 residues of the target sequence
has at least 30% sequence identity. The polyprotein wORF1ab was first split into 16 putative proteins
based on its alignment with the human SARS polyprotein, with each protein independently searched
against PDB. In total, structural templates for 17 proteins have been determined (Table 1, Figs. 1-3). In
some cases, several independent templates, each covering an individual protein domain, of a large target
2019-nCoV protein were determined. The obtained template was then used in the comparative modeling
protocol, generating five models. Each model was then assessed using DOPE statistical potential [74] and
the best-scoring model was selected as a final prediction.

To model a protein-protein interaction complex, a multi-chain modeling protocol is used [39].
Specifically, we align the corresponding pairs of homologous proteins and combine them into a single
alignment where the individual chains are separated by “/” symbol. The alignment is used as an input
together with the multi-chain structural template of a homologous complex. In case of viral-human
interaction (these are the only virus-host structural templates found), the human protein remains the same
in the alignment. In total, 18 structural templates of protein complexes involving homologs of 14
2019-nCoV proteins were retrieved (Fig. 3). Similar to the single-protein protocol, five candidate models
are generated for each complex conformation, and each model is assessed using DOPE statistical
potential following selection of the best-scoring model as a final prediction.

Mapping of functional regions and evolutionary conservation
We next extract protein- and ligand-binding sites and map it onto the models of 2019-nCoV proteins. For
protein binding sites, the obtained modeled structures of protein complexes that involve 2019-nCoV
proteins are considered. For each 2019-nCoV protein in a protein-protein interaction complex, we identify

all binding residues that constitute its protein-binding site. Given an interaction between two proteins, a
residue on one protein is defined as a protein binding site residue if there is at least one pair of atoms, one
from this residue and another from a residue in the second protein, with VDW surfaces not farther than
1.0 Å. Using this definition, the binding sites are identified with UCSF Chimera [75]. The ligand binding
sites are identified and mapped using a different protocol –we rely on the default definition of proteinligand binding site residues from PDB 3D Ligand View, since this standard is widely accepted. Once all
ligand binding sites residues are identified for a related coronavirus, the residues are then mapped onto
the surface of the related 2019-nCoV protein using a structural alignment between the two proteins, which
puts into a one-to-one correspondence residues from both proteins.

Inferring intra-viral and virus-host protein-protein interaction network
Next, we leverage the obtained protein homology information to predict and map all possible intra-viral
and virus-host protein interactions at a systems level. Since the 2019-nCoV genome exhibits substantial
similarity to the 2002 SARS-CoV genome [76] and proteome [77], we hypothesize that many of the
interactions observed in the SARS proteome are expected to be preserved in the 2019-nCoV proteome as
well, unless the corresponding binding sites were affected. The information on the interactome will help
us understanding the global mechanistic processes of the viral molecular machinery during viral infection,
survival within the host, and replication. With this knowledge, we can discern the protein interactions that
are crucial for transmission and replication—such interactions can be potential candidates for inhibitory
drugs [78]. Furthermore, using the systems approach, we can identify hubs and bottlenecks new to 2019nCoV that could again be targeted by the antiviral drugs.

For this purpose, we create a comprehensive integrated SARS-CoV interactome that consists of both
intra-viral and virus-host interactions. The SARS intra-viral interactome was created using published data,
where the SARS-CoV ORFeome was cloned and a genome-wide analysis of viral protein interactions

through yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) matrix screens was performed [61]. The Y2H matrix screen was
summarized by combining interactions in one direction, both directions and self-interaction. We also
included intra-viral interactions gathered from the literature review [61]. The aggregated intra-viral
interaction network consists of 31 proteins and 86 unique interactions.

We then construct the SARS-CoV-Host interactome through published interaction data, where first the
SARS-CoV ORFeome was cloned for Y2H screens and used as a bait [64]. Specifically, a cDNA library
encoding 5,000 different human genes were used that acted as prey molecules. We also include virus-host
interactions mined from literature survey of 5,000 abstracts [64]. The curated virus-host interaction
network consists of 118 proteins, including 93 host proteins, and 114 unique virus-host interactions. Next,
to create an integrated network, the two individual networks were imported in Cytoscape [79] and merged
to form a unified interactome representing both intra-viral and virus-host interactions. Finally, we include
our predictions from structural modeling of 2019-nCoV intra-viral and virus-host interactions, surveyed
recent literature on predicted 2019-nCoV interactions and annotated them accordingly in the unified
interactome. The unified interactome consists of 125 proteins (94 host proteins) and 200 unique
interactions. In addition, network analysis is performed to compute a set of topological statistics (degree
distribution, clustering coefficient, and other important characteristics) to characterize parameters of the
three networks, before which the networks are pruned for duplicate edges. Finally, the 200 putative
interactions were annotated based on the extent to which the protein binding sites of the 2019-nCoV
proteins were altered, compared to their SARS homologs. Based on the evolutionary conservation
analysis of the putative protein binding sites extracted from the modeled complexes, some interactions
were annotated as potentially disrupted.
