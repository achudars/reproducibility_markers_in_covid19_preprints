Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a focal point for vaccine immunogen and therapeutic
antibody design, and also serves as a critical antigen in the evaluation of immune responses to
COVID-19. A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is
the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed
glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by
antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays.
From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and
PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report
that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike
proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via FcγRII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA
and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the
SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing
literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for crossreactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating effects on human
health and economies. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and belongs to the
coronavirus family of large, enveloped viruses that rely on a trimeric transmembrane spike (S)
glycoprotein for host cell recognition and entry(1). The SARS-CoV-2 spike is a transmembrane
protein consisting of an S1 domain, which contains the cell surface receptor binding domain
(RBD), and S2 domain that includes the region that promotes viral fusion(2, 3). Due to its
accessibility on the viral surface and its critical role in the viral life cycle, the SARS-CoV-2
spike represents a crucial antigen in host immune responses. As antibody responses to
vaccination and COVID-19 infection are further investigated via mainstay serological
methods(4–8), the potential for cross-reactive epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 S to provide
confounding results remains an important consideration. Cross-reactive antibodies against
viruses both closely and distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 may bind the spike protein with either
high or low affinity and may provide the potential for virus neutralization. Indeed, several studies
have demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivities involving closely related coronaviruses(9–
12) along with others such as dengue virus(13, 14) and HIV(15). Investigation of such crossreactive interactions may reveal novel viral epitopes and vulnerabilities, along with providing
context for the interpretation of serological assay studies, of which some have failed to
demonstrate antibody titers as an appreciable predictor of immunity, disease status, and disease
progression for COVID-19(16–19).
Viral spike proteins are typically populated by a variable array of host-derived glycans, which
serve multiple functions, amongst which include epitope occlusion and immune system
evasion(20). Such viral glycosylation patterns themselves may be sufficiently antigenic to elicit

antibody responses, and even confer viral neutralization when bound. Indeed, there exist multiple
broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV spike gp120, whose epitopes involve critical
glycan contacts(21). The SARS-CoV-2 spike contains 22 N linked glycosylation sites which are
variably glycosylated(22), representing the potential for glyco-epitope mediated cross reactivity.
A recent study has reported SARS-CoV-2 S glyco-epitope recognition by mannose directed Fabdimerized antibodies against HIV gp120(15), confirming that glycosylation mediated crossreactivity is possible. We aimed to further investigate such cross-reactivities using a panel of
broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies which recognize glycan and peptide epitopes within
gp120.
Results
To investigate the existence of cross-reactive glyco-epitopes within the SARS-CoV-2 spike, we
subjected a panel of glycan-reactive anti-HIV-1 gp120 antibodies to an ELISA-based crossreactivity screen (Figure 1). We selected nine anti-gp120 antibodies whose epitopes have been
shown to involve glycans, along with two anti-gp120 antibodies which recognize the gp120
CD4-binding site as negative controls (Table S1) and assessed the ability of these antibodies to
bind SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain, purified to homogeneity (Fig. S1a ). While the CD4binding site directed antibodies VRC01 and VRC03 were unable to bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike
ectodomain, we observed various levels of cross-reactivity for most of the screened glycanreactive antibodies, the most potent of which were 2G12, PGT128 and PGT126 (Figure 1). As
expected, a positive control antibody VH-FC ab8 which targets the SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain (RBD)(23) demonstrated potent binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain
in the same assay (Figure S2a). Glycan-dependent cross-reactivity of 2G12 with the SARS-CoV-

2 spike has been recently described(15), and as 2G12, PGT128 and PGT126 exhibited similar
levels of cross-reactivity, we selected these antibodies for further investigation.
We next sought to determine the neutralization capabilities of these cross-reactive antibodies, via
use of a SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus entry assay(24) (Figure 2). No neutralization
capabilities were detected for 2G12, PGT128, and PGT126 over a wide range of concentrations,
while VH-FC ab8 demonstrated potent neutralization, in keeping with previous reports(23). As
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection has been described for SARS-CoV-2 via
engagement of cellular FcγRII receptors(25), we evaluated the potential for antibody directed
enhancement of infection (ADE) by these antibodies, in the FcγRII receptor expressing K562
erythroleukemic cell line(26) (Figure 2c). We were unable to observe an enhancement of
pseudoviral entry into K562 cells under a wide range of antibody concentrations, suggesting
these antibodies are unlikely to mediate ADE via FcγRII receptor engagement.
To further characterize the cross-reactivity of 2G12, PGT128 and PGT126 with the SARS-CoV2 spike protein, we assessed the immunoreactivity of these antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2
spike ectodomain via Western blot (Figure 3a). Immunoreactivity was observed for 2G12,
PGT128, and PGT126, while VRC01 immunoreactivity was not detected, consistent with the
results of our initial ELISA screen. We next aimed to assess the ability of these antibodies to
cross-react with full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike under native conditions. To this end, we
performed immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing lysate generated from cells transiently
expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (Figure 3b). The full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike
was successfully immunoprecipitated by 2G12, PGT128 and PGT126, but not by VRC01,
implicating these cross-reactive epitopes to be present in the full-length spike under nondenaturing conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate dose-dependent interactions between 2G12,

PGT128, and PGT126 but not VRC01 and cell-associated full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike via a
cell-based ELISA assay (Figure 3c), corroborating our immunoprecipitation results.
Having characterized the cross-reactivities of 2G12, PGT128 and PGT126 with the SARS-CoV2 spike, we proceeded to investigate the potential contribution of glycans in these interactions.
We had observed abolished cross-reactivities when using casein-based blocking buffers (Figure
S3) compared to BSA-based blocking buffers (Figure 1) in our initial cross-reactivity screens.
Given the high carbohydrate content of casein(27), it suggested a possibility that these
interactions may be glycan sensitive. Importantly, interactions between VH-FC ab8 and the
SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain were not perturbed in casein-based buffer (Figure S2a-b). We
first assessed these cross-reactive interactions in the presence of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside, a
stabilized mannose analogue, via ELISA (Figure 4a). Disruption of cross-reactivity was observed
for all three antibodies with increasing concentrations of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside,
demonstrating the glycan sensitivity of these interactions. Expectedly, VH-FC ab8 displayed
glycan insensitive binding in this assay, consistent with its RBD epitope within the SARS-CoV-2
spike(23). We next evaluated the cross-reactivities exhibited by these antibodies with
differentially glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike preparations. We expressed SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain in cells grown either in the presence or absence of kifunensine, a mannosidase
inhibitor which facilitates the production of highly glycosylated, high mannose glycoproteins(28)
(Figure S1). SDS-PAGE analysis of the resulting purified proteins revealed SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain produced in kifunensine treated cells exhibits a hindered electrophoretic mobility
relative to ectodomain produced in untreated cells (Figure 4b), consistent with the higher extent
of glycosylation expected with kifunensine treatment. All three antibodies exhibited increased
relative affinities and observed extents of binding with SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain produced in

cells treated with kifunensine compared to ectodomain produced in untreated cells (Figure 4c-d),
further highlighting the participation of glycans within these cross-reactive interactions. As
expected, VH-FC ab8 remained insensitive to the spike glycosylation state (Figure S2c). Taken
together, these results implicate 2G12, PGT128 and PGT126 as targeting cross-reactive glycoepitopes within the SARS-CoV-2 spike.
Discussion
We have identified a novel set of cross-reactive interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike and
broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. A recent study(15) has demonstrated such crossreactivity using Fab-dimerized antibodies such as 2G12, which target high mannose epitopes
with gp120, and here we have extended these results to include anti-HIV antibodies which
recognize gp120 at epitopes involving both peptide and glycans. Using a combination of
immunoblotting, ELISA, and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate PGT128 and
PGT126 bind both ectodomain and full-length SARS-CoV-2 S constructs, under denaturing and
native conditions, in a glycan dependent manner. Using pseudo-typed viral entry assays, we
demonstrate these cross-reactivities to be non-neutralizing, and likely incapable of mediating
ADE via FcγRII receptor engagement.
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a plethora of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing
strategies have emerged(4–8), with the goal of providing epidemiological, diagnostic, and
prognostic insight to health care providers. Such strategies have primarily focused on the
detection of antibodies which bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid (N) proteins,
however, recent studies have failed to demonstrate an appreciable predictive value between
antibody titers and viral neutralization, disease status, and disease progression(16–19). While
concurrent assessment of aspects of cellular immunity will likely contribute predictive value in

such studies, efforts to further characterize humoral responses beyond serological detection of
antigen-binding antibodies can provide a critical context for the interpretation of results.
Assessments of aggregate antibody titers are incapable of differentiating between low affinity,
non-neutralizing and high affinity, neutralizing antibodies, limiting their clinical utility. Crossreactive antibodies have the potential to contribute confounding effects in such serological
studies, and our results exemplify this possibility as we demonstrate the ability for low affinity,
non-neutralizing, cross-reactive antibodies to bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike at antigenic glycoepitopes. These results underscore the potential value of including neutralizing assays when
evaluating patient antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, and the importance of not relying solely
on methods that only detect antibody-antigen interactions to evaluate humoral responses.

density of 3 × 106 cells/ml using linear polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences). For Kifunensine
treatment, cultures were treated with 5 µM Kifunensine 3 hrs post-transfection. At 24 hrs posttransfection, cultures were supplemented with 2.2 mM valproic acid. The supernatant was
harvested by centrifugation after 5 days, filtered and loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap Excel column
(Cytiva). The column was washed with buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM
imidazole) and the protein was eluted with buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM
imidazole). Purified protein was concentrated and loaded onto a Superose 6 column (Cytiva)

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
100µl of SARS-CoV-2 2P S protein preparations were coated onto 96-well MaxiSorp™ plates at
1µg/ml in PBS overnight at 4°C. All washing steps were performed 5 times with PBS + 0.05%
Tween 20 (PBS-T). After washing, wells were either incubated with BSA-based blocking buffer
(PBS-T + 2% BSA) or Casein-based blocking buffer (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20 +1% Casein) for
1hr at room temperature. After washing, wells were incubated with dilutions of primary
antibodies in either BSA-based blocking buffer or Casein-based blocking buffer for 2hrs at room
temperature. After washing, wells were incubated with goat anti-human IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) at a 1:10,000 dilution in either BSA-based blocking buffer or Casein blocking
buffer, for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, the substrate solution (Pierce™ 1-Step™)
was used for colour development according to the manufacturer's specifications. Optical density
at 450nm was read on a Varioskan Lux plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The same
protocol was conducted for methyl α-d-mannopyranoside competition assays, keeping the
concentration of the indicated primary antibodies at 5µg/ml while including dilutions of methyl
α-d-mannopyranoside as indicated.
Cell-based ELISA
HEK293T cells were seeded in 96 well plates and transfected with either a plasmid encoding the
full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-S-2xStrep-IRES-Puro) or mock
plasmid (pcDNA3.1) using branched PEI (Sigma). Media was switched 24hrs post-transfection.
At 48hrs post-transfection, cells were washed 5 times with PBS prior to fixation with 4%
paraformaldehyde in media for 30 minutes at 4°C. All further washing steps were performed 5
times with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Cells were washed prior to blocking in blocking
buffer (PBS-T + 2% BSA) for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated

with dilutions of primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 hrs at room temperature. After
washing, cells were incubated with goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:5,000
dilution in blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, substrate solution
(Pierce™ 1-Step™) was used for colour development according to the manufacturer's
specifications. Optical density at 450nm was read on a Varioskan Lux plate reader (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The difference in signals between cells transfected with full-length spike and
mock plasmid was calculated.
Western Blotting
Purified SARS-CoV-2 2P spike ectodomain was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes prior to blocking in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) + 2% BSA for 1
hr at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with the indicated anti-gp120
antibodies at 2µg/ml in TBS-T+ 2% BSA overnight at 4°C. After washing, membranes were
incubated with goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:5,000 dilution in TBS-T+
2% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, membranes were visualized using
SuperSignal™ chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunoprecipitations
Immunoprecipitations were performed using the Dynabeads immunoprecipitation kit
(Invitrogen). 100 µL of Dynabeads was incubated with 10 µg of either PGT126, PGT128, 2G12,
VRC01, or PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) as a beads-only control for 30 min at room
temperature. Cellular lysates were generated from HEK-293T cells transiently expressing fulllength SARS-CoV-2 spike (transfections as described for cell-based ELISA). Cells were
solubilized in ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-

100 with 1mM PMSF added fresh, and further disrupted via sonication. Lysates were then
centrifuged at 12,000g for 2 mins and the supernatant was retrieved for immunoprecipitation
input. After washing 3 times with 1 ml of PBS-T, antibody-bead complexes were incubated with
lysate for 1 hr at room temperature on a rocking platform. Beads were washed 3 times with PBST and bound proteins were eluted directly into 4x Laemmli buffer with 10% dithiothreitol and
boiled. The samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis and detected using an antiSARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibody (Abcam – ab27504).
Pseudoviral entry assays
SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped retroviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells as described
previously(24). Briefly, a 3rd generation lentiviral packaging system was utilized in combination
with plasmids encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike, along with a transfer plasmid
encoding luciferase and GFP as a dual reporter gene. Pseudoviruses were harvested 60 hrs after
transfection, filtered with 0.45 µm PES filters, and frozen. For cell-entry and neutralization
assays, HEK293T-ACE2 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 500,000 cells per well. The next
day, pseudoviral preparations were incubated with dilutions of the indicated antibodies or media
alone for 1 hr at 37°C prior to addition to cells and incubation for 48 hrs. Cells were then lysed
and luciferase activity assessed using the ONE-Glo™ EX Luciferase Assay System (Promega)
according to the manufacturer's specifications. Detection of relative luciferase units was carried
out using a Varioskan Lux plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
For ADE evaluation, human lymphoblast K562, which expresses FcγRII was utilized in the place
of HEK293-T cells as described above. ADE was determined by comparing relative luciferase
signals in the presence of the indicated cross-reactive antibodies to signals in the absence of
these antibodies (pseudovirus only).

Statistical Analysis
One-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett or Sidak’s post-test was used
to test for statistical significance. Only p values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically
significant (p > 0.05 [ns, not significant], p ≤ 0.05 [∗], p ≤ 0.01 [∗∗], p ≤ 0.001 [∗∗∗]). For all
statistical analyses, GraphPad Prism 8 software package was used (GraphPad Software).

Figure 1. ELISA screen of glycan directed anti-gp120 antibody cross-reactivities to the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Serial dilutions of the indicated mAbs were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 S
protein binding. VRC01 and VRC03 target the CD4 binding site within gp120 and are
included here as negative controls. All ELISAs were performed using BSA-based buffers (see
methods). Experiments were done in duplicate; error bars indicate standard deviation (n = 2).

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 S binding capabilities of selected cross-reactive anti-gp120
antibodies. (a) Immunoreactivity of selected anti-gp120 antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2 S
ectodomain was assessed via western blot, membranes were probed with the indicated
antibodies prior to detection via HRP-anti-human IgG. A Coomassie-stained gel is included as
a loading control. (b) Immunoprecipitation (IP) of full-length SARS-CoV-2 S by selected antigp120 antibodies. Lysates generated from HEK293T cells transiently expressing full-length
SARS-CoV-2 S were incubated with the indicated antibodies and subjected to
immunoprecipitation using protein A beads prior to Western blot (WB) analysis with a
commercially available antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2 S. An immunoprecipitation condition
using protein A beads alone is included as a control. Shown is a representative blot from 2
independent experiments. (c) Cell-based ELISA of cell-associated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S
binding by the indicated anti-gp120 antibodies. Assays were carried out on chemically fixed
HEK293T cells either transfected with plasmid encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 S, or empty
plasmid (mock). The difference in signal between these conditions is presented. Experiments
were done in triplicate; error bars indicate standard deviation (n = 3). Statistical significance
was tested by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-test (p > 0.05 [ns, not significant], p ≤ 0.05

tested by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-test (p > 0.05 [ns, not significant], p ≤ 0.05 [∗],
p ≤ 0.01 [∗∗], p ≤ 0.001 [∗∗∗]).

Figure S3. ELISA screen of glycan directed anti-gp120 antibody cross-reactivities to the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike using the casein-based buffer. Serial dilutions of the indicated mAbs
were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding. VRC01 and VRC03 target the CD4 binding
site within gp120 and are included here as negative controls. All ELISAs were performed
using casein-based buffers (see methods). Experiments were done in duplicate; error bars
indicate standard deviation (n = 2).
