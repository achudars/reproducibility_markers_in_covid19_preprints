Abstract

34

The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic is triggering a global health emergency alert, and recent

35

research is indicating the relevance of aerosols in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Thus,

36

in this study antiseptic mouthwashes based on the actives chlorhexidine (CHX) and

37

octenidine (OCT) were investigated regarding their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2

38

using EN 14476. Based on the requirement of EN 14476 (i.e. reduction of viral titer

39

by ≥ 4 log 10), the OCT-based formulation was effective within only 15 sec against

40

SARS-CoV-2, and thus constitutes an interesting candidate for future clinical studies

41

to prove its effectiveness in a potential prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by

42

aerosols.

Introduction

44

Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses and are characterized by

45

club shaped spikes on the surface of the virion, prompting the name coronavirus due

46

to the similarity in appearance to a solar corona [1]. Until the SARS-CoV outbreak in

47

2002, coronaviruses were thought to only cause mild self-limiting infections in

48

humans but were known to cause a wide variety of infections in animals [1]. 17 years

49

later, in December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent

50

of severe pneumonia in a cluster of patients [2], designated as SARS-CoV-2 due to

51

its relatedness to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3].

52

Since then SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world thereby triggering a global health

53

emergency alert. Thus, until vaccination becomes available a bundle of effective

54

preventive measures is desperately needed.

55

In this context, recent publications suggest the use of antimicrobial mouthwashes as

56

a preventive measure. This is based on the efficacy of antimicrobial mouthwashes to

57

reduce the number of microorganisms in the oral cavity prompting a reduction of

58

microorganisms in aerosols [4]. This is particularly interesting, as recent research

59

indicates the relevance of aerosols also in the spread of SARS CoV-2 [5].

60

Thus, in their review summarizing data for mouthwashes with chlorhexidine

61

gluconate (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), povidone-iodine (PVP-I), and

62

hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Vergara-Beunaventura and Castro-Ruiz indicate an

63

essential role of antiseptic mouthwashes to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load in dental

64

practice and undermine that research on this topic is urgently needed to verify the

65

potential of antiseptic mouth rinses as a further preventive measure [6]. The aim of

66

our study was therefore, to directly compare commercially available antiseptic

67

mouthwash formulations based on the common antiseptic actives chlorhexidine

68

(CHX) and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT) regarding their efficacy against the

69

pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In vitro-experiments were carried out in

70

accordance to the well-established European Standard EN 14476 [7] determined for

71

evaluating the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics, in which

72

reduction of at least four decimal logarithms (log10) of viral titer is requested to state

73

efficacy.

Material and Methods

76

Quantitative Suspension tests according to EN 14476

77

Quantitative suspensions tests were carried out as described in EN 14476 [7].

78

Briefly, efficacy against SARS CoV-2 [8] was studied using commercially available

79

mouthwashes. A commercially available ready-to-use formulation designated

80

formulation

81

GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Health GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) was used as one

82

test formulation. In addition, a commercially available ready-to-use formulation

83

designated formulation B (100 g contains: 0.2 g Chlorhexidine bis-(D-gluconate);

84

GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Health GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) was used.

85

Formulation C used in this study was also a ready-to-use preparation (trade name:

86

octenisept, (drug authorisation number: 32834.00.00); 100 g contains: 0.1 g

87

octenidine dihydrochloride, 2 g phenoxyethanol). Concentrations and contact times

88

used throughout this study are indicated. Experiments were carried out under

89

conditions of low organic soiling (0.3 g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA); “clean

90

conditions”) as defined in EN 14476 [7].

91

Data presented are based on at least two independent experiments. Validation

92

controls as defined in EN 14476 [7] were found to be effective in all experiments

93

indicating validity of presented data.

95

Results and Discussion

96

Comparison of different commercially available mouthwashes based on the well-

97

established antiseptically effective actives chlorhexidinedigluconate (CHX) and

98

octenidinedihydrochloride (OCT) was conducted considering the European Standard

99

EN 14476 [7]. The assays were carried out using an isolated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak

100

strain [8] in the presence of low organic soiling (i.e. 0.3 g/L bovine serum albumin) as

101

requested by EN 14476 [7] to also consider potential quenching of the actives by

102

protein load as has been described before [9].

103

Data is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 A shows SARS-CoV-2 reduction obtained for

104

products A, B and C using end point titration. In these experiments the two

105

formulations based on chlorhexidinedigluconate (formulations A and B) were found

106

to have only limited efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, at a concentration of 80%

107

(v/v) formulation A containing 0.1 % chlorhexidinedigluconate reduced the virus titer

108

even at a prolonged contact time of 10 min by less than 1 log10. Formulation B

109

containing 0.2 % chlorhexidinedigluconate reduced SARS-CoV-2 within a contact

110

time of 1 min as well as at a prolonged contact time of 5 min when tested at 80%

111

(v/v) concentration also by less than 1 log10. As for formulations A and B reduction of

112

the virus titer was found not to be impacted by cytotoxic effects of the formulations,

113

indicated by the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), no additional large-volume

114

plating (LVP) experiments were conducted. This is well in line with data from

115

screening experiments in our lab, where virus reduction titers were found not to be

116

elevated due to less toxicity when using both formulations at a concentration of only

117

20% (v/v) (data not shown).

118

In contrast, when looking at the data for formulation C logarithmic reduction factors

119

log10 were found to be 1 log10 higher (i.e. ≥ 3.02 log10) for the 20% (v/v) concentration

120

of product C when compared to the 80% (v/v) test concentration (i.e. ≥ 2.02 log10).

121

This indicates, that the measuring window for product was diminished by cytotoxicity.

122

Therefore, additional large volume plating (LVP) experiments to obtain a wider

123

measuring window were conducted with formulation C. Data obtained using LVP are

124

presented in figure 1 B, and indicate a reduction of SARS-CoV-2 titers by ≥ 4.38

125

log10 already within the shortest contact time of 15 sec for the octenidine

126

dihydrochloride (OCT)-based mouthwash (formulation C). This was found for both

127

test concentrations tested (80% (v/v) and 20% (v/v)).

128

Data presented in this study for the two CHX-based mouthwashes (formulations A

129

and B) are well in line with data published by Meister et al. [10]. In their investigation

130

of different mouthwashes targeting SARS-CoV-2 also only a limited efficacy (i.e. < 1

131

log10) of the two tested commercially available mouthwashes based on

132

chlorhexidinedigluconate was found. However, looking at the data for the

133

octenidinedihydrochloride-based mouthwashes, in the earlier study by Meister et. al.

134

[10] only limited virucidal activity of the formulation tested (i.e. < 1 log10) was found,

135

whereas in this study the tested octenidinedihydrochloride-based formulation (C)

136

was found effective against SARS-CoV-2 within 15 sec (i.e. ≥ 4 log10). This differing

137

data can be explained by the use of two different octenidine-based formulations in

138

the

139

octenidinedihydrochloride as the only active was used as compared to the OCT-

141

octenidinedihydrochloride in combination with phenoxyethanol. Furthermore this

142

discrepancy indicates the value of pre-evaluating each individual formulation on the

143

basis of EN 14476 when assessing the virucidal potential against SARS CoV-2. For

144

this pre-evaluation the standard test surrogate virus modified vaccinia virus strain

145

Ankara (MVA) to assess “virucidal activity against enveloped viruses” as defined in

146

EN 14476 [7] has been found to be of value, as with this approach a non-pathogenic

147

virus can be used in the lab to obtain reliable data regarding virucidal activity against

148

enveloped viruses in general including SARS CoV-2.

149

In conclusion, in this study virucidal efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 could be

150

demonstrated for formulation C meeting the > 4 log10 requirement of EN 14476 [7]

151

within a contact time of only 15 sec, making this formulation suitable to be used as a

152

mouthwash.

153

Thus, based on this in vitro-data the OCT-based formulation used in this study

154

constitutes an interesting candidate for future clinical studies to prove its

155

effectiveness in a potential prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spread by aerosols.
