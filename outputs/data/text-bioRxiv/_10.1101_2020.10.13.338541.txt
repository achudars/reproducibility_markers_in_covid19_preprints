The international SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need to identify new anti-viral
drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients. The initial step to identifying potential candidates usually
involves in vitro screening. Here we describe a simple rapid bioassay for drug screening using Vero
E6 cells and inhibition of cytopathic effects (CPE) measured using crystal violet staining. The assay
clearly illustrated the anti-viral activity of remdesivir, a drug known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication. A key refinement involves a simple growth assay to identify drug concentrations that
cause cellular stress or “cytomorbidity”, as distinct from cytotoxicity or loss of viability. For instance,
hydroxychloroquine shows anti-viral activity at concentrations that slow cell growth, arguing that its
purported in vitro anti-viral activity arises from non-specific impairment of cellular activities.

The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in widespread activities seeking to identify new
anti-viral drugs that might be used to treat COVID-19 patients 1-4. Remdesivir has emerged as a lead
candidate with clear anti-viral activity in vitro 5 and non-human primates 6, with some promising
early results in human trials 7, 8. The quest for new anti-viral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 (as for other
viruses) usually begins with in vitro screening to identify potential candidates 9-11. Initial screening
usually involves assessing whether drugs can inhibit virus replication in a permissive cell line, with
Vero E6 cells widely used for SARS-CoV-2. Such in vitro screening approaches often identify drugs
that work well in vitro, but ultimately fail to have anti-viral activity in vivo. For example,
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro 5, 12, but the drug
ultimately emerged to have no utility in COVID-19 patients 13-15. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine
has been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity, but no antiviral activity in humans for a number of
viruses including Epstein Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis) 16, dengue 17, HIV 18, chikungunya
19
, Ebola 20 and influenza 21.
Although there are multiple reasons why in vitro anti-viral activity often does not translate into in
vivo utility, one reason for false positives from in vitro screening assays is the misapplication of the
therapeutic index concept as it applies to tissue culture-based anti-viral drug discovery, where this
index is generally referred to as the selectivity index. The concentration of a drug that inhibits virus
replication is often compared to the concentration that kills the cells (cytotoxicity). The MTS assay
is also often used as a cytotoxicity or viability assay, although it actually measures mitochondrial
activity. Viral replication would clearly be inhibited in cells that are not viable; however, what is
perhaps under-appreciated is that viable, but stressed or otherwise slightly poisoned or compromised
cells, are also likely to have a reduced capacity to replicate virus. Cellular stress responses can take
multiple forms, but a key outcome of most stress responses is inhibition of translation 22-25.
Translational inhibition is also a key anti-viral response, which is able to inhibit replication of many
viruses 22, 25, 26 including coronaviruses 27. Thus a drug that has no specific anti-viral activity, but that
is able to induce cellular stress, may therefore inhibit virus replication non-specifically and generate
a potential false positive in the screening assay.
A key outcome of stress responses is usually to slow cell growth, allowing the cell to either
recover, or if stress and/or damage is excessive, to induce cell death 28-30. Cells that are slightly
poisoned or otherwise compromised (without induction of stress responses) would likely also show
reduced growth rates. Cell growth of Vero E6 cells can be very simply measured by seeding 400
cells per well in triplicate into a 96 well flat bottom plate and culturing with a range of drug
concentrations for 4 days followed by crystal violet staining. The percentage of protein staining
relative to a no-drug control is then calculated and provides a simple measure of the drug
concentration that slows cell growth. Perhaps not surprisingly the drug concentrations that caused
inhibition of cell growth were usually lower than the drug concentrations that caused cytotoxicity
(Fig. 1, compare black circles with green squares). For some drugs the concentration differences for
these two activities were >10 fold (Fig. 1, ribavirin, cycloheximide, oleuropein, didemnin B).
Inhibition of cell growth is not really cytostasis, which generally means no growth, and not really
cytotoxicity, which is generally viewed as cell death. The reason(s) for reduced cell growth induced
by any given drug may not be clear, and may be related to stress responses or some other phenomena
that compromises the cells normal metabolic activities. Hence we suggest the term “cytomorbidity”
to infer a level of cytotoxicity insufficient to kill the cells or induce cytostasis, but sufficient to stress
or compromise the cells, with a simple growth bioassay used to indicate cytomorbidity.

is to determine whether the drug can inhibit virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in Vero E6 cells.
Remdesivir is known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication 5 and is used herein to illustrate the behavior
of an effective drug in this bioassay. Remdesivir was able to inhibit virus-induced CPE by 50% at
≈1 µg/ml and the drug caused 50% cytotoxicity at ≈100 µg/ml, providing a selectivity index of ≈100.
Importantly, remdesivir showed cytomorbidity at ≈80 µg/ml, which still leaves a selectivity index of
≈80 (Fig. 1 and 2, Remdesivir). Hydroxychloroquine was able to inhibit viral CPE by 50% at ≈20
µg/ml and showed a 50% loss of viability using the MTS assay at ≈100 µg/ml, suggesting a selectivity
index of ≈5. However, cytomorbidity was clearly evident at ≈20 µg/ml, so the anti-viral activity
occurred at similar concentrations to those that caused cytomorbidity (Fig. 1, Hydroxychloroquine);
indicating a potential false positive. The overlapping activities are clearly evident when the crystal
violet stained plates are viewed (Fig. 2).
The close relationship between anti-viral activity and translation inhibition (inherent in the stress
responses described above) can be seen with the use of the translation inhibitors, cycloheximide and
didemnin B. These drugs provide selectivity indices of >10, when comparing viral CPE inhibition
and cytotoxicity. However, concentrations that inhibited viral CPE again overlapped with those that
caused cytomorbidity (Fig. 1, Cycloheximide, Didemnin B). The drug γ-mangostin would appear to
have a small level of anti-viral activity with a low selectivity index, but again this activity overlapped
with the cytomorbidity (Fig. 1, γ-mangostin). Thus, as for hydroxychloroquine, the assay results for
these latter drugs provide no supportive data for anti-viral activity, instead they suggest these drugs
inhibit viral replication non-specifically by impairing cellular activities. Nitazoxanide showed some
anti-viral activity, but this coincided with cytotoxicity, providing an example of the conventional
cytotoxicity control that would be used to argue that the drug has no specific anti-viral activity and
has a selectivity index of 1 (Fig. 1, Nitazoxanide). Curiously, higher concentrations of nitazoxanide
were needed to inhibit cell growth than were needed to induce cytotoxicity; likely an example cell
density associated toxicity.
The frequently used MTS assay, as expected, often gave results similar to those provided by the
cytotoxicity assay. Importantly the MTS assay did not provide a measure of cytomorbidity,
presumably because mitochondria largely remain active even in stressed cells and/or cells in G0
(cytostasis). For oleuropein, cyclosporine A and γ-mangostin, cytomorbidity was associated with an
increase in MTS activity (Fig. 1). The MTS bioassay may thus provide slightly misleading
information in this context; i.e. increased mitochondrial activity, rather than indicating increased cell
numbers, can sometimes be associated with stress or mild toxicity.
The CPE based assay described herein is really only useful for screening drugs that target the virus
directly. For instance, drugs whose mechanism of action requires induction of type I interferons,
would be ineffective as Vero E6 cells do not make type I interferons. Another limitation of using
virus-induced CPE as a read-out for anti-viral drugs is sensitivity. Higher drug concentrations are
likely needed to prevent viral CPE (overwhelming infection resulting in cell death) than would be
needed to inhibit viral replication as measured (for instance) by qRT-PCR of virus released into
culture supernatants 31. Nevertheless, the CPE-based assay represents a screening tool able rapidly
to identify promising anti-viral candidates. More sensitive assays could be also envisaged for
assessing cytomorbidity, such as measuring activation of stress factors such as ATF3 32, analyzing
cell cycle perturbations by flow cytometry or cell growth kinetics using the IncuCyte live-cell analysis
system. However, the simple growth assay proposed herein allows rapid identification of drug
concentrations that disrupt cellular activities/functions, which are often sufficient to inhibit viral
replication non-specifically. The cytomorbidity assay thereby flags potential false positives.

Methods
PC3/BSL3 facilities. All infectious SARS-CoV-2 work was conducted in a dedicated suite
within the PC3/BSL3 facility at the QIMR Berghofer MRI (Australian Department of
Agriculture, Water and the Environment certification Q2326 and Office of the Gene
Technology Regulator certification 3445). Work was approved by the QIMR Berghofer MRI
Biosafety Committee (P3600).
Cells and SARS-CoV-2 virus. Vero E6 cells (C1008, ECACC, Wiltshire, England; Sigma
Aldridge, St. Louis, MO, USA) were cultured in medium comprising RPMI1640 (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin
(100 μg/ml) (Gibo/Life Technologies) and L-glutamine (2 mM) (Life Technologies). Cells
were routinely checked for mycoplasma (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit MycoAlert,
Lonza) and FCS was assayed for endotoxin contamination before purchase 1. The SARSCoV-2 virus was kindly provided by Queensland Health Forensic & Scientific Services,
Queensland Department of Health, Brisbane, Australia. The virus (hCoV19/Australia/QLD02/2020) was isolated from a patient and sequence deposited at GISAID
(https://www.gisaid.org/; after registration and login, sequence can be downloaded from
https://www.epicov.org/epi3/frontend#1707af). Virus stock was generated by infection of
Vero E6 cells at multiplicity of infection (MOI)≈0.01, with supernatant collected after 3 days,
cell debris removed by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 min at 4°C, and virus aliquoted and
stored at -80 °C. Virus titers were determined using standard CCID50 assays (see below).
The virus was determined to be mycoplasma free using co-culture with a non-permissive cell
line (i.e. HeLa) and Hoechst staining as described 2.
Virus titration by CCID50 assay. Virus was titrated using a standard Cell Culture Infectivity
Dose 50 (CCID50) assay. Vero E6 cells were plated into 96 well flat bottom plates at 2x104
cells per well in 100 µl of medium (see above). The following day 100 µl of virus was added
in 10 fold serial dilutions in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FCS, and the plates cultured
for 4 days at 37°C and 5% CO2. To inactivate virus and stain the cells, 50 µl of
formaldehyde (15% w/v) and crystal violet (0.1% w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added per well
to the 200 µl of medium already present in each well. Plates were left overnight inside a
closed biosafety cabinet with lids on (biosafety cabinet UV switched on for 20 mins). The
plates (lids off) and inverted lids were then exposed to 7.6 kJ/m2 UV-C. The lids were
replaced and the plates sprayed with 80% (v/v) ethanol; plates were labelled with Alcohol
Resistant Cryogenic Permanent Markers (Science Marker). The plates are then deemed
decontaminated and removed from the PC3/BSL3 facility. The plates were washed in tap
water, dried (photographed or scanned) and 100 µl/well of 100% methanol added and OD
read at 595 nm. The virus titer was determined by the method of Spearman and Karber (a
convenient Excel CCID50 calculator is available at https://www.klinikum.uniheidelberg.de/zentrum-fuer-infektiologie/molecular-virology/welcome/downloads).

Drugs. Didemnin B was kindly provided by the Natural Products Branch, NCI (NSC
325319, Bethesda, MD, USA). Cycloheximide, nitazoxanide, ribavirin, hydroxychloroquine
sulfate, γ-mangostin and oleuropein were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Remdesivir was
purchased from AdooQ BioScience. Cyclosporine A (Merck Millipore) was dissolved in
100% EtOh. Ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate was dissolved in Ultrapure Distilled
Water (Life Technologies). All other drugs were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). All
drugs were aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
Cytotoxicity testing and MTS assay. Vero E6 cells were plated as above, 104/well in
triplicate in 100 µl medium and cultured overnight. The drug was diluted in 2 fold serial
dilutions in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FCS, and 50 µl was then added per well (at 4
times the indicated final concentration). A further 50 µl RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2%
FCS was then added per well. The plates were cultured for 4 days, after which they were
fixed and stained with crystal violet as above. A MTS assay was performed where indicated
(before fixation and crystal violet staining) using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Cytomorbidity testing. Vero E6 cells were plated at 400 cells per well in 100 µl medium.
All other steps were performed as described above for cytotoxicity testing.
Anti-viral activity testing. Vero E6 cells were plated as above, 104/well in triplicate in 100
µl medium and cultured overnight. The drug was added at 4 times the indicated final
concentration in 50 µl RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FCS. SARS-CoV-2 virus at a
MOI≈0.01 was then added in 50 µl RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% FCS. After 4 days of
culture the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet as above.
