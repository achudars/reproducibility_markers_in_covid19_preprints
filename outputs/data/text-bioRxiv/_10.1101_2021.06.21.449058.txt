ABSTRACT

32

Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities moved to emergency remote teaching (ERT).

33

This allowed institutions to continue their instruction despite not being in person. However, ERT is not without

34

consequences. For example, students may have inadequate technological supports, such as reliable internet and

35

computers. Students may also have poor learning environments at home and may need to find added employment

36

to support their families. Additionally, there were consequences to faculty. It has been shown that female

37

instructors are more disproportionately impacted in terms of mental health issues and increased domestic labor.

38
39

This research aims to investigate instructors’ and students’ perceptions of their transition to ERT. Specifically, we

40

wanted to:

41

1. Identify supports and barriers during the transition to ERT

42

2. Compare instructors experiences with the student experiences

43

3. Explore these supports and barriers within the context of social presence, teaching presence, and/or

44

cognitive presence during ERT as well as how these supports and barriers relate to scaffolding in

45

emergency remote courses

46
47

Design: Using grounded theory techniques, we applied two-cycle, qualitative analyses to assess the instructor

48

transcripts. In first-cycle analysis, we used open coding to develop initial ideas from the data. We then used second

49

cycle coding to generate categories with definitions and criteria agreed upon during discussion-based consensus

50

building. Finally, these categories and descriptions were used to code student survey data.

51
52

Analyses/Interpretations:

53

Instructors identified twice as many barriers as supports in their teaching during the transition to ERT and

54

identified casual and formal conversations with colleagues as valuable supports. Emerging categories for barriers

55

consisted of academic integrity concerns as well as technological difficulties. Similarly, students identified more

56

barriers than supports in their learning during the transition to ERT. More specifically, students described pre-

57

existing course structure, classroom technology, and community as best supporting their learning. Barriers that

challenged student learning included classroom environment, student availability, and student emotion and

comfort.

Contribution: Together, this research will help us understand supports and barriers to teaching and learning during

62

the transition to ERT. This understanding can help us better plan and prepare for future emergencies, particularly at

63

MSIs, where improved communication and increased access to resources for both students and instructors are key.

INTRODUCTION
In the middle of the Spring 2020 academic term, many institutions of higher education were forced to

67

move all instruction online. The term “pandemic pedagogy” was quickly coined as educators, many of whom had

68

never taught online or remotely, scrambled to come up with effective ways to teach their courses (Schwartzman,

69

2020). Although moving to remote instruction can enable flexibility of teaching and learning (Daymont et al.,

70

2011), the speed at which instructors and students were expected to move to remote instruction was unprecedented.

71

Therefore, it is important to distinguish this quick transition to remote teaching, or emergency remote teaching

72

(ERT), from the traditional online teaching. Here, we use the term online teaching to refer to traditional online

73

teaching (i.e., teaching online during non-pandemic times), and have adopted Charles Hodges’s definition of ERT

74

as a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery mode due to crisis circumstances (Hodges et

75

al., 2020). ERT is characterized by improvised, quick solutions in less-than-ideal circumstances, and it was the best

76

solution most universities had to academic learning. This is different from traditional online teaching where

77

instructors are intentionally designing a course to be implemented and delivered online, a delivery mode that has

78

been studied for decades (Bender, 2012; Lewis & Abdul-Hamid, 2006; Oliver, 1999; Young, 2006). There are

79

numerous research studies, theories, models, and evaluation criteria created for traditional online teaching (Oliver,

80

2000; Ouyang & Scharber, 2018; Shelton & Hayne, 2017). Studies have shown that effective online learning stems

81

from careful instructional design, planning, and using a systematic model for the development (Branch & Kopcha,

82

2014). This careful design process was likely to be absent in most ERT shifts due to lack of time and experience

83

necessary for instructors to carefully design their course for online purposes.

84

In addition to a shortage of time and experience, the move to ERT introduced a variety of issues that

85

instructors and students had not faced during in-person teaching, such as lack of communication (Gelles et al.,

86

2020). Previous research on emergency teaching during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 showed that virtual student-to-

87

student interactions and remote class dialogues created opportunities for students to provide mental and emotional

88

support for each other (Lorenzo, 2008). Other issues with ERT include navigating the course in a new manner,

89

finding new ways to implement formative assessment, communicating with students in a fair and equitable

90

manner, monitoring academic integrity, and managing everything through a remote platform (Brooks & Grajek,

91

2020; Johnson et al., 2020). Additionally, many students moved home and were expected to attend college from

92

home while being quarantined with their family. Students needed to learn how to navigate a new learning platform

93

and adjust to new patterns, all while experiencing loss of social interactions. Shay and Pohan 2021 described how

94

“many low-income, first-generation students also struggle with a lack of quiet workspaces, the absence of internet

95

and other technological tools, housing and/or food insecurity, and the added responsibilities associated with being

96

at home and helping the family (e.g., employment, care, etc.)” (Shay & Pohan, 2021). Stress, anxiety, and

97

traumatic events contributed to students’ cognitive load, - the demand or burden on one’s working memory -

98

making the focus on learning more challenging for students (Shay & Pohan, 2021). Finally, high-quality internet is

99

an enabling technology for ERT, and in the US approximately 21 million people, or 6.5% of the population, do not

100

have broadband internet access (Chavez, 2020; Commission, 2018). This lack of access to technology during ERT

101

created a digital divide in higher education for both instructors and students. Additionally, despite most institutions

102

transitioning to ERT, there is a lack of literature examining ERT experiences in higher education, particularly for

103

college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (Johnson et al., 2020). Since

104

COVID forced ERT began, there have been some new literature examining a wide variety of impacts on students

105

and instructors (Affouneh et al., 2020; Bozkurt & Sharma, 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021; Karakaya, 2021;

106

Whalen, 2020). Despite this new literature, there is a need to fill this gap in literature by examining what helped

107

and hindered both instructors and students during their transition to ERT. We aim to help fill this gap by studying

108

supports and barriers due to COVID-19 ERT at a minority serving institution.

109

The University of California (UC), Merced is in a unique situation to study the rapid transition to ERT.

110

While it is a member of a well-resourced university system, its student population is highly diverse and similar to

111

student populations that are typically understudied in education (Council, 2012; Kanim & Cid, 2020). For example,

112

during the 2019-2020 academic year the UC Merced undergraduate population was 74% first-generation, 54%

113

Hispanic (and only 9% non-Hispanic white), and 64% Pell-Grant eligible. This student population is representative

114

of populations across the country that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, as they are vulnerable to

115

living in persistent poverty, holding unstable or uncertain employment, and without stable housing (Burke, 2020).

116

Additionally, UC Merced’s faculty population is younger (83% of UC Merced STEM faculty under age

117

55, compared to 62% across the UC system) and more likely to be a woman (35% of UC Merced STEM faculty

118

are women, compared to 24% across the UC system) than faculty in the UC system as a whole (University of

119

California, 2020a) (University of California, 2020b). Like the student population, the faculty population is more

120

likely to suffer personally and professionally, from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic than the

121

broader UC population. Female instructors in general, are thought to be more disproportionately impacted in terms

122

of mental health issues and increased domestic labor due to the pandemic (Brooks & Grajek, 2020; Donner, 2020;

123

Krentz et al., 2020). Because of these factors, we wanted to understand the supports and barriers experienced by

124

UC Merced instructors and students during the transition to ERT.

126
127

Theoretical Frameworks
The work we present here is guided by the Community of Inquiry (COI) framework (D Randy Garrison et

128

al., 2010). The COI framework is a collaborative-constructivist process model that describes the essential elements

129

of successful online higher-education learning experiences (Garrison, 2016; Garrison et al., 2000). The COI

130

framework has been widely used when investigating traditional online learning as it is grounded in a social

131

constructivist approach to learning (Garrison et al., 1999) (e.g., Arbaugh et al., 2008; Castellanos-Reyes, 2020)

132

(Piaget, 1976). Additionally drawing from this social constructivist lens, learners co-construct knowledge by

133

engaging in actions that elicit and validate their sociocultural identities (Dewey, 1986; Vygotsky, 1978). Vygotsky

134

contended that socially-situated learning, accompanied by scaffolding, led to stronger outcomes in both knowledge

135

development and retrieval (Dewey, 1986; Vygotsky, 1978). In addition to COI, we utilized the scaffolding

136

framework as a collaborative-constructivist process model from which we examined how instructors have adapted

137

to remote pedagogy and the supports and barriers that instructors and students found helped them or hindered

138

them. Scaffolding refers to the help or guidance from a more competent peer or mentor that allows students to

139

work within, and then move beyond, the zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Wass et al., 2011).

142

Generally, COI is a process model of online learning which views

143

the online educational experiences as arising from the interaction of three

144

elements: teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. In

145

the COI framework, teaching presence, is defined as the design,

146

facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social processes to realize

147

teacher-defined learning outcomes. This element has three components: 1)

148

instructional design and organization (e.g., instructor provides clear

149

instructions on how to achieve course learning outcomes); 2) facilitating

150

discourse (e.g., instructor helps to keep course participants engaged and

151

participating in productive dialogue); and 3) direct instruction (e.g.,

152

instructor presents useful examples that allows students to better

153

understand course content) (Anderson et al., 2001b) (Figure 1). Research has shown that teaching presence is

154

an
important for successful online learning and strongly correlates with student satisfaction, perceived learning,, and

155

sense of community (Kucuk & Richardson, 2019; Liu, 2019; Manwaring et al., 2017; Soffer & Cohen, 2019).. Shea

156

on
and Bidjerano (2008) found that the quality of teaching presence and social presence reported by learners in online

157

0)
courses could predict learning represented by the cognitive presence. Additionally, D.R. Garrison et al. (2010)

158

nitive
found that student perceptions of teaching presence predicted significant direct effect on perceptions of cogniti

159

ng
presence, while social presence had an indirect or mediating effect on cognitive presence. Therefore, teaching

160

presence has been shown to be central in creating quality online learning experiences.

The second element in the COI framework, social presence, is defined as the ability for learners to bee

162

we
perceived as “real people.” It is primarily focused on affective expression (e.g., students perceived online or web-

163

based communication as an excellent medium for social interaction), open communication (e.g., students felt

164

ssions
comfortable interacting with other course participants), and group cohesion (students perceived online discussi

as helping them develop a sense of collaboration). Research on social presence has demonstrated a strong

relationship between social presence and student learning outcomes (d’Alessio et al., 2019; Hwang & Arbaugh

169

is necessary for students to feel as they are dealing with real people, that they belong in some way to a group of

170

learners, and that they are involved in sharing, negotiating, arguing, and discussing (Wang, 2008). In general,

171

online learning environments should be active, allow student to construct their own knowledge, make effective use

172

of collaborative and cooperative learning methods, and be meaningful to students while promoting social presence

173

and community (Ally, 2004).

174

Finally, the third element, cognitive presence, is defined as the extent to which learners can construct and

175

confirm meaning through sustained reflection and discourse. It is rooted in social constructivism, which is a robust

176

theory proposing that people’s learning is shaped by cultural context, conversation, and collaboration (Dewey,

177

1986; Vygotsky, 1978). Cognitive presence has four components: 1) triggering event (e.g., students felt motivated

178

to explore content related questions); 2) exploration (e.g., students used a variety of information sources to explore

179

problems posed in the course); 3) integration (e.g., learning activities helped students construction

180

explanations/solutions); and 4) resolution (e.g., students applied the knowledge created in the course to their work

181

and non-class related activities). Of the three elements in COI, cognitive presence has been identified as the most

182

difficult to study as well as the most challenging to develop and sustain in online courses (Garrison & Cleveland-

183

Innes, 2005). This difficulty arises from the fact that cognitive presence contains inputs (the triggering event),

184

processes (exploration and integration), and outputs (resolution) that can be hard to measure or observe, whereas

185

the other two elements consist of processes that can be more easily observed (Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007).

186

While the COI framework has been tested for online learning and K-12 teachers during ERT (Whittle et

187

al., 2020), it has only recently been used for ERT in undergraduate STEM classrooms at a Minority-Serving

188

Institute (MSI). For example, Reinholz et al. used the COI framework to study how the nature of student

189

participation changed in moving from face-to-face to synchronous online learning environments at an Hispanic

190

serving institute (HSI) (Reinholz et al., 2020) and Eriksen et al. studied how student perceptions of social

191

presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence online due to COVID-19 were influenced by student

192

demographics (Erickson & Wattiaux, 2021).

195

In 1976, Wood, Bruner and Ross introduced the term scaffolding (Wood et al., 1976) and many researchers

196

and educators have used the concept of scaffolding to describe instructor roles as more knowledgeable peers for

197

guiding student learning and development (Hammond, 2001; Stone, 1998; Wells, 1999). Scaffolding has been

198

interpreted in a wide sense as “a form of support for development and learning” (Rasmussen, 2001, p570).

199

Alternatively, it can be used as an umbrella metaphor to describe the way that teachers supply students with the

200

tools necessary to learn (Jacobs, 2001).

201

While there are different approaches in the literature on how scaffolding may or may not be intertwined

202

with Vygotsky’s ZPD (Vygotsky, 1980), we used Wells’s argument that scaffolding can be a direct application and

203

operationalization of ZPD (Berk, 2003; Duchesne & McMaugh, 2018; Wells, 1999). Wells identified three features

204

that characterize educational scaffolding: 1.) The essentially dialogic nature of the discourse in which knowledge is

205

co-constructed (dialog); 2.) the significance of the kind of activity in which knowing is embedded (activity); and

206

3.) the role of artifacts that mediate knowing (artifacts) (Wells, 1999, p.127). Furthermore, the relationship

207

between classroom challenge and support is important in scaffolding (Hammond & Gibbons, 2005). Hammond and

208

Gibbons (2005) found that highly supportive, but minimally challenging environments may be too easy to elicit

209

growth in knowledge, whereas experiences that are highly challenging but lack sufficient support will likely result

210

in failure. This becomes an important aspect of scaffolding to consider as we examine how instructors and students

211

experienced the switch to ERT.

212
213

Therefore, we had three main objectives:

214

229

Instructor

230

In May 2020, we sent an initial recruitment email, via departmental list serves and individual email

231

addresses, to tenure-track faculty, adjunct faculty, and teaching assistants who were teaching STEM courses at UC

232

Merced. The initial email included the purpose of the study, procedures, benefits, IRB approval, potential

233

dissemination of the results, question information, and contact information. Instructor recruitment occurred

234

approximately two months after the institutional switch to ERT.

235

We chose the instructors in this study due to their ongoing involvement in a larger institutional study on

236

assessing teaching and discourse practices in college STEM classrooms. This larger study focused on instructors

237

who 1) taught either a lower or upper division undergraduate or graduate STEM course and 2) taught a lecture or

238

laboratory course. To recruit participants for this study on the transition to ERT, we applied the same requirements

239

(1 and 2) plus two additional criteria: 3) taught a remote course via synchronous instruction (excluded in-person

240

and asynchronous instruction), and 4) taught in Spring 2020.

241
242
243

Student
During the instructor recruitment process, all instructors were asked if they would be willing to invite their

244

students to a 30-minute in-class or out-of-class group interview. Out of 31 instructors that agreed to participate in

245

the instructor interviews, 22 agreed to inviting their students to these interviews (71% participation rate). Students

246

from five courses attended and agreed to participate in these interviews (16% participation rate).

Instructor interviews were carried out via Zoom between May 11 and May 27, 2020. The semi-structured

260

interviews ranged in length from 10-90 minutes, where the participants were asked six questions regarding

261

Student surveys and group interviews were carried out via Zoom during the final week of instruction

271

(between May 5 and May 8, 2020) by three Students Assessing Teaching and Learning (SATAL) interns, an

272

assessment team of trained undergraduate students out of UC Merced’s Center for Teaching and Learning (CETL)

273

(Signorini & Pohan, 2019). Individual surveys and group interviews lasted about 30 minutes during discussion

274

sections, where the participants were asked five questions regarding perceived supports and barriers, changes in

275

interactions with instructors and other students, and potential future supports. This manuscript will focus only on

276

perceived supports and barriers from the student surveys (Table 2).

from grounded theory methods, we used two cycle qualitative analysis (Miles et al., 2018) to explore instructor

284

interview transcripts in a section-by-section fashion (Figure 3).

286

First (open) cycle coding

287

First-cycle qualitative coding allows researchers to gain a comprehensive and integrated view of a dataset

288

(Miles et al., 2018). It is intentionally cyclical, such that a code generated during the first cycle is not meant to be a

289

static assessment. Rather, fluidity is essential. As we engaged in first cycle analysis, we used open coding to look

290

holistically across all the data, and to identify repeating indicators of instructors’ perceptions of teaching during the

291

COVID-19 pandemic. Strauss and Corbin (1998) describe open coding as a process of examining properties and

292

dimensions that exist within the data, allowing the researcher to identify unique and discrete aspects (Miles et al.,

293

2018). To do this, we looked across all instructor transcripts and began assigning codes that indicated how

294

instructors perceived supports and barriers while they conducted ERT. Table 3 demonstrates what first cycle, open

295

coding looked like for one of the two researchers (CD and EM).

Prior to moving into the second cycle of analysis, we engaged in consensus-building with five researchers

300

(CD, EM, PK, WA, and HB). Consensus building in qualitative analysis is a critical measure of ensuring validity

301

and trustworthiness (Corbin & Strauss, 2014). To address inter-coder consistency, we independently coded

302

approximately 10% of all transcripts, and then we used discussion-based consensus building to address

303

discrepancies in codes. Saldaña (2015) describes this process as interpretive convergence, specifically useful in

304

qualitative analysis where dynamic interpretations of data are paramount, as opposed to seeking statistical

305

significance in quantitative methodologies. In our efforts to converge toward common codes, we discussed both

306

our individual open codes as well as our analytic memos. Analytic memos in qualitative analysis serve as a

307

researcher’s dialogue, both with themselves and each other, about what the codes mean to them as they are coding

308

(Charmaz, 2006; Corbin & Strauss, 2014; Miles et al., 2018; Stake, 2005). Table 4 depicts open codes and analytic

309

memos during one of our consensus coding sessions. It shows five of the author’s initial codes, generated

So one of the challenges there is to prevent students from communicating, but we couldn’t do it with a large
class just like we had with Bio 2. One section was over 200 students. So what I had to do was use a trick.
’Cause we were using breakout rooms. Maybe, I’ll come back to that in a different question. But to finish off
your question here, I’ve tried at Stanislaus to have 150 students on camera with their microphones, and it
worked. Although, three students did drop and have to reconnect. So I found that useful to have pictures of
that—all the students taking the exam using either their screen camera, or if they didn’t have a working
computer camera, I made them put their phone next to them and theirselves so I could see what their eyes
were looking at. --- Kailish

Second (axial) cycle analysis
The aim of second cycle analysis is to find linkages between the discrete parts that were earlier identified

318

in open coding (Miles et al., 2018), in order to find “broader categories, themes, theories, and/or assertions” (p.

319

234). Essentially, this involves looking for similarities and differences across the previously identified properties

Four researchers (CD, EM, PK, and HB) worked together to make descriptions for supports and barriers

categories. The following categories and descriptions emerged from the data (Supplemental Table 1). Support

331

categories included: prior experience, timing, technology for remote teaching, community, help with technology,

332

socio-emotional factors, teacher beliefs, working from home, help with teaching, course attributes, student comfort

Student deductive coding

339

A deductive coding approach was used to identify the various student support and barrier categories

340

generated from coding the instructor interviews (Table 2). First, two researchers (PK and MCK) independently

341

coded the student responses using the 12 support categories (Table 9) or 14 barrier categories (Table 10) to get

342

initial codes (Table 7). Each student response was one to three sentences in length and could contain more than one

343

category.

Next, PK and MCK met to discuss their categories until reaching 100% consensus (Table 8). When coding

349

student responses, authors noticed that the working descriptions of some categories would only fit the instructor

350

perspective and needed to be redefined to be used for student coding. Authors then met to discuss which

351

descriptions should be changed and rewrote them so that the codes could be used for both students and instructors

alike.

358

Following student coding using the categories and agreed upon descriptions, we brought the categories,

359

themes, and descriptions of categories to an expert feedback panel of five. The expert feedback panel was made-up

360

of STEM educators (both biology and chemistry), discipline-based education researchers (DBER), and learning

361

scientists at a research-intensive institution unrelated to the one in this study. This expertise allowed the panel to

362

provide valuable feedback on category descriptions.

363

The formatting for the feedback was organized in two parts. For the first part, the first author (CD)

364

presented the support instructor and student themes, categories and their descriptions along with examples

365

(Supplemental Table 1). Expert feedback panelists were then allowed to ask questions prior to a short content

366

validation. This content validation consisted of splitting the panelists into two groups and providing each group

367

with the same three support quotes representative of categories in each of the three themes (Supplemental Table 3

368

and 4). The panelists were given all the support categories and descriptions and were asked to match the quote with

369

a category and provide justification via notes. Additionally, authors CD, PK and JA were present in both groups to

370

take notes on feedback. After each group had finished choosing categories for the quotes, everyone met back in

371

one group and the answers were discussed. Comments and feedback are reported in Supplemental Table 3 and 4.

372

Following this discussion, the barriers, their descriptions, and themes were then presented by CD to the expert

373

feedback panel (Supplemental Table 2). The same two groups were then created, and panelists were again given

374

the list of barriers and their descriptions and asked to decide which category fit each quote best. After each group

375

had finished all comments and questions were recorded (Supplemental Table 5 and 6). Again, CD, PK, and JA

376

were present in both groups to take notes on feedback.

377

Following the expert feedback panel, all coders met and discussed the feedback. This discussion allowed

378

changes from version 2 to version 3 for categories and descriptions (Supplemental Table 7 and 8). These are the

379

final categories and descriptions presented in this manuscript.

381
382

RESULTS
The findings presented here are separated into the two primary areas of study, supports and barriers.

383

We identified 134 unique support codes which led to the development of 12 categories, and, ultimately, three

384

support themes: 1) tools and support for class content, 2) mental & emotional support, and 3) preexisting supports.

385

A total of 203 unique barrier codes were identified, which led to the development of 14 categories from which the

386

following three barrier themes emerged: 1) structures getting in the way, 2) spending more time and effort, and 3)

387

affective issues.

388
389
390

Instructor supports
Instructors described a variety of supports when discussing their switch to ERT. These supports ranged

391

from existing structures that made remote teaching easier to emotional support from colleagues. Here, we describe

392

how we went from transcript to themes (Table 9).

393
394
395

Instructor open coding for supports
By starting with open coding, we were able to deductively determine what codes were present in all

396

transcripts. This process allowed us to develop codes that may not have been present in an already formalized

397

coding tool.

An example support is given below:

Yeah. So I needed some technical help, just advice about online exams and best practices for doing
synchronized learning. But then, the DBER Club and the scientific institutes, those were also just
moral support types of help. Just knowing that it was new for everyone, we’re all struggling, and
hearing from other folks about particular types of issues to figure out if what I was experiencing
was similar or different and, yeah, just getting ideas about how to handle different situations. --Laney
During the open coding process CD identified supports that were both technical and moral, while EM

408

identified a support of hearing how others were handling the situation. During the consensus process, discussion

409

between the consensus coders focused on whether to differentiate between technical and moral support, how

410

specific to be with respect to technical support, and whether it was the people or the discussions that were the

411

actual support. This discussion resulted in two codes:

412
413

1. Conversations with colleagues about potential ideas and practices

414

2. Casual conversations with colleagues for moral support

415

After consensus coding all the supports, a total of 134 unique supports were identified.

417

Instructor categories for supports

418

After reaching consensus on all the transcripts, the researchers individually collected the codes into

419

categories, then met to resolve any differences. This process led to the creation of 12 categories, shown in Table 9.

420

These categories covered topics, such as access to technology, help with remote teaching pedagogy, access to a

421

supportive community, the comfort of working from home, and the timing of the switch to ERT. As an example of

422

how these support categories came about, consider the two quotes below:

I’d say getting the Canvas website very organized has supported the class content delivery.
[Claire] ended up looking at my class when I was weaving up the website when all this had to
happen—when I was putting this online. So having somebody who had developed detailed Canvas
modules before—just gave me a few tips—was really useful right then. ---Constance
I felt like, specifically at UC Merced, there was this general community, this sense of community
among all of the colleagues and everybody banding together and making it—making the whole
learning environment as good as it could be. That’s what it felt like. I felt very fortunate to be at
UC Merced working with all these really cool people who are doing the best that they can to make
sure that everything’s hunky dory. ---Josephine
On the surface both quotes seem similar, in that both Constance and Josephine identified people they could

436

talk to as a support. However, Constance’s quote points to the support of having someone available to answer

437

specific, course-related questions about best practices, whereas Josephine’s quote is more about the camaraderie of

438

people in similar situations and knowing that others are persevering under difficult circumstances. As a result of

439

these differences, Constance’s quote was coded as ‘help from more experienced colleagues’, whereas Josephine’s

440

quote was coded as ‘community of colleagues’. These differences also led to the quotes being placed in different

441

categories. As Constance’s quote was focused primarily on pedagogical help, it was placed in the ‘help with

442

teaching’ category, whereas Josephine’s quote, which focused much more on the emotional support of others, was

443

placed in the ‘community’ category.

Instructor themes for supports

446

Once the codes were categorized, the researchers individually organized them into themes, and then met to

447

resolve any differences. This process led to the creation of three broad themes of: 1) tools and support for class

448

content, 2) mental/emotional support, and 3) preexisting supports, shown in Table 9.

So in the classroom, we’ve been using Canvas and Zoom a lot. We’ve been doing breakout
sessions, making sure to—mostly with follow-up e-mails a lot, things like that, personally wired
headsets, stuff like that, as far as hardware and such like that. I’m not sure if I’m answering the
question. ---Chase
Chase’s quote was representative of the supports that fell into the ‘tools and support for class content’

456

theme. These were supports those instructors identified as helping them deliver or develop material in a remote

457

environment. Other examples of this theme were workshops from UC Merced’s CETL, online groups that

458

instructors could turn to with pedagogical questions, and the ability to host videos through sites like YouTube.

459
460
461
462
463
464
465

Well, for me, personally, I think the students have been very good, very supportive. Even though I
don’t see them anymore, they still have a very good attitude and participate in lectures and
worked very hard, take it pretty seriously. So that’s emotionally or psychologically, that’s a very
positive factor. ---Yuan
Yuan’s quote was representative of the supports that fell into the ‘mental/emotional support’ theme, which

466

are supports that help instructors and TAs handle the additional stress and emotional toll of working in a remote

467

environment, under unfamiliar conditions. Other examples of this theme were having a supportive partner at home,

468

enjoying the challenge of trying something new, and having a well-developed transition plan to minimize

469

confusion.

One is because of another project I worked on, I was familiar with making videos and editing
videos. So the technology was familiar to me. I was already somewhat familiar with Zoom. I’ve
already had been doing a fair amount of using CatCourses and Top Hat and web-based tools for
teaching alongside my face-to-face. So it wasn’t like I went from totally in class to totally not. I
think that helped. ---Danielle

Danielle’s quote was representative of the supports that fell into the ‘preexisting supports’ theme. These

478

were supports that were already in place that inadvertently made the transition to remote teaching easier for the

479

instructors. Other examples were instructors who had prior experience with online teaching, student familiarity

480

with streaming services, and courses previously delivered using a flipped modality.

485

Following supports, we found a larger variety of barriers described by instructors discussing their

486

transition to ERT. These barriers covered issues ranging from instructor access to technology to concerns about

487

academic integrity. Here, we describe how we went from transcript to themes.

Instructor open coding for barriers
An example barrier is given below:

No, it was a slow decline toward the end of the semester. And you usually get that in classes,
anyways, but I was noticing it a whole lot more. Some students just become overwhelmed and
slowly stop turning in assignments, but this seemed a little more pronounced than what I’ve
usually seen. ---Diane
During the open coding process CD identified a decrease in student participation as a barrier, while EM

498

identified a decrease in quality of student work as a barrier. During the consensus process, discussion between the

499

consensus coders focused on gauging participation and measuring quality, which resulted in barrier code of

500

‘decrease in student assignment submissions.’ After consensus coding all the barriers, a total of 203 unique barriers

501

were identified.

502
503
504

Instructor categories for barriers
While there were many more barriers than supports coded, the barriers collapsed into a similar number of

505

categories (14 barrier categories, compared to 12 support categories), shown in Table 10. These categories covered

506

topics such as issues with instructors and students using technology, increased responsibility, and workload,

507

decreased student motivation, and concerns about student integrity. As an example of how these barrier categories

508

came about, consider the two quotes, below:

With a pre-recorded video, that’s impossible. Then, students won’t even watch it. I was convinced
I shouldn’t do asynchronous. Then, through the experience, I discovered that conviction was
reinforced, because the students told me. I asked them multiple times, and they told me, “This is
much better precisely because we can stop you and just ask you to explain the thing, again.” --Arturo
It’s up to them to use their time the way they want to do it, but what we’re finding is it’s hard to
project with the statistics whether they’re actually watching the videos or skimming through the
videos or how many times they’re watching the videos. That’s hard data to obtain. The only way to
get at it is to maybe get an assignment back from them—a lab or a quiz or whatever. You covered

some of the stuff on the videos and kind of points out, “These are some of your flaws that you’re
not really looking at the videos.” ---Roberto
Similar to the support quotes discussed above, both Arturo and Roberto identified barriers that, on the

524

surface, seem similar in that they both present difficulties with video lectures. However, Arturo’s quote really

525

pointed to the difficulty of getting immediate feedback from students about specific topics, whereas Roberto’s

526

quote was more about collecting data about whether students are really watching the videos. As a result of these

527

differences, Arturo’s quote was coded as ‘asynchronous teaching was not possible due to students not being able to

528

provide timely feedback about content understanding’, while Roberto’s quote was coded as ‘assessing if students

529

are watching videos.’ In addition, these differences led to the codes being placed in different categories. Because

530

Arturo’s quote was about the potential difficulty of engaging and interacting with students via an asynchronous

531

modality, his code ended up in the ‘instructional space’ category and Roberto’s quote, which focused much more

532

on difficulties measuring student interaction, ended up in the ‘assessment difficulties’ category.

533
534

Instructor themes for barriers

535

Once the codes were categorized, we individually organized them into themes, and then met to resolve any

536

differences. This process led to the creation of three broad themes of: 1) structures getting in the way, 2) spending

537

more time and effort, and 3) affective issues, shown in Table 10. Exemplar quotes for these three themes are shown

538

below.

And I think, sometimes, it assumes that what happens in those meetings is being shared with other
faculty, and that’s not always the case. And so it would have been nice to hear some of that earlier
on. And I think going forward that that should just be made explicitly clear that more information
is better, I guess, especially when we’re all separated from each other. So that would have been a
nice support to have. ---Laney
Laney’s quote was representative of the barriers that fell into the ‘structures getting in the way’ theme.

547

These were barriers that instructors identified as preventing them from quickly and efficiently transitioning to

548

ERT. Other examples of this theme were poor bandwidth for instructors, TAs, and students, lack of access to a

549

quiet workspace, and difficulty writing math equations in Zoom.

Then I figured out, oh, they can see everybody in the entire class. Then it wouldn’t make it a group
discussion. Then I put students in groups where each group is all the students in the discussion
session, and the time it took to put that together just sucked. So much of my time got sucked up
with this bureaucratic, digital—I had to click buttons. I had to move students. I had to crossreference things. ---Claire
Claire’s quote was representative of the barriers that fell into the ‘spending more time and effort’ theme.

558

These were barriers associated with instructors and TAs working less efficiently. Other examples of this theme

559

were having to take time to teach other instructors how to teach remotely, working harder to have students engage

560

with the material, and the inefficiency of communicating via Zoom.

I know, and also, my big concerns were for the mental health of my students because they all—my
class is really unique, they all live together… and they are all each other’s best friends, and then
they just got ripped apart from each other. At the beginning of the week everything was fine, and
then that Friday everybody was home and they weren’t seeing each other for the rest of the
semester. And I know that that was tough on them. And so I was concerned for everybody’s
wellbeing. ---Kiera
Kiera’s quote was representative of the barriers that fell into the ‘affective issues’ theme. These were

570

barriers associated with instructors or TAs dealing with negative emotions, either theirs or from students. Other

571

examples of this theme were worrying about student academic integrity, witnessing abusive home environments,

572

and feeling guilty about not being an expert in remote teaching.

Student supports
Students described nine supports when discussing what helped their learning through the transition to

578

ERT, ranging from course attributes to prior experiences that students had before the start of ERT (Table 9).

579

However, ‘course attribute’s (38.6%), ‘technology for remote teaching’ (22.9%), and ‘community’ (11.4%) were

580

the three most frequent categories described by students as supporting their learning during ERT (Figure 4). Here,

581

we describe how we went from student survey responses to categories for Claire’s class. For example, one student

582

wrote that:

583
584
585
586

Homework assignments and discussion sections with my TA were extremely helpful, and the lab
sections also helped. ---Sammi

587

Homework assignments, discussions sections, and lab sections were all attributes of the course that had

588

existed prior to the transition to ERT. Therefore, Sammi’s quote was placed into the category ‘course attributes’

589

since the student discussed components of the course (e.g., homework assignments) that help them ease into the

590

transition to ERT. This was the most frequent support category described by students. Two other students, Ash and

591

Jax, wrote that:

593
594
595
596
597
598
599
600

I think the instructional videos provided helped us greatly in learning the content of the course.
Zoom calls helped us catch up and know his outlook on the plan for the coming week of the course.
---Ash
Zoom discussions, zoom lectures, recorded lectures, online tutoring services outside of school --Jax
Ash stated that features of the Zoom platform aided their learning, which lead to their response being put

601

in the category’ classroom technology.’ In addition, Jax listed Zoom lectures, discussions, and other online sources

602

as resources that helped their learning, which lead to this response being placed in the category’ classroom

603

technology.’ Finally, another student wrote that:

604
605
606
607
608
609

Having online lectures actually felt like I was more connected to the class rather than in person,
so that really helped me out. ---Ekene
This quote was placed in the category ‘community’ because of the connection to the class that aided the
student and helped them sustain their learning.

Student barrier categories
Students described ten barriers when discussing what challenged their learning during ERT. These barriers

614

ranged from concepts such as instructor technology issues to instructional spaces (Table 10). However,

615

‘instructional space’ (23.7%), ‘student emotion and comfort’ (21.1%), and ‘student presence and participation’

616

(21.1%) were the most frequent categories students found challenging their learning during ERT (Figure 5). Here,

617

we described how we went from student survey responses to categories for students from Constance’s class. For

618

example, two students wrote that:

environment. Therefore, both quotes were put in the category’ instructional space.’ Additionally, two students

628

wrote that:

It was hard to focus at home because there were a couple of distractions. Also I kind of lost some
motivation through online learning. ---Xia
Productivity was a challenge of mine. I live in a household with younger siblings who are not only
rowdy but also need help with their online classes as well. ---Rio
There are many different reasons that might prevent students from attending or participating in course

637

activities or office hours. These factors can range from different emotional states to familial responsibilities and

638

can have a negative impact on students’ learning. Because Xia and Rio described facing some of these difficulties

639

causing them to be unproductive, they were placed in the category’ student presence and participation.’ Lastly, one

640

student wrote that:

642
643
644
645

When we transitioned to [video only] lectures. I felt cut off and sort of isolated from the class. It
was starting to feel pretty lonely and discouraging. ---Mitra
Because Mitra wrote that this isolation was a barrier to their learning, and it resulted in them feeling lonely

646

and discouraged, it was listed as ‘student emotion and comfort.’ We placed it in that category because we felt it

647

could be included as a concern for student emotional well-being.

Instructor and student comparisons
To further investigate the student experience, we decided to compare the student survey data to their

652

instructors. We wanted to know if the students that we surveyed had a similar experience in their transition to ERT

653

as their instructors. It was fortunate that we had all four instructors of the students surveyed as part of our

654

instructor data. All the student data came from students with at least one course taught by an instructor that also

655

participated in our study, and we wanted to compare the supports and barriers identified by the students with these

656

four instructors. When assessing the instructor and student category data we found that there were more barriers

657

described by students than supports, like the instructors’ results. The most frequent support categories applicable to

658

students were ‘course attributes’, ‘technology for remote teaching’, and ‘community’. In comparison, the

659

instructors of those students’ most frequent support categories were ‘community’, ‘help with teaching,’ and ‘help

660

with technology.’ We found that both instructors and students overlapped with mentioning the ‘community’

category defined as a “personal or professional network to sustain teaching, learning, or yourself.” It is

So by and large, colleagues, and a broader, especially for the courses I teach, a pretty strong
community, a professional community outside of the campus. So other specialists in my area that
are also engaged in teaching the same kinds of classes ---Haik (Instructor)
I like how professor [Instructor Haik] set up a hybrid online course. This allowed me to view the
lecture videos on my own time and i still had the opportunity to ask questions and listen to the
questions of my peers during zoom lectures. ---Mitra (Student)
If we look at Haik, the instructor, and one of their students, Mitra, we can see how they both described

673

their perspective colleagues as part of their supportive community. Instructor Haik discussed how his community

674

of support is other specialists in his area of research and Mitra discussed how their peers during synchronous

675

teaching provide support.

676

The categories’ instructor teaching inexperience’ and ‘time management’ were some of the most common

677

categories from instructors as barriers to their transition to ERT. However, neither of these categories were

678

mentioned by students, showing that even though there may be overlapping supports between students and

679

instructors, the barriers seem to differ more. One common barrier cited by instructors and students was the

680

category’ instructional space’, which we have described as “difficulty implementing or participating in teaching

681

and learning activities.”

With breakout rooms, students weren’t really—they needed to be introduced and encouraged, kind

really difficult that if I was in a breakout room, nobody could contact me. If my TA was like, hey,
you need to come back, they couldn’t reach me. ---Claire
The difficulty of focusing given the format, and the impersonal-ness of lectures, as well as the
difficulty of following lectures when the pace is not as connected with the students’ ability to keep
up. ---Sammi
The instructor Claire and one of her students Sammi both described how ‘instructional space’ inhibited

693

their teaching or learning. Claire described how she found it difficult to get students to work in groups and find the

694

students and groups that needed her help. Sammi felt it was difficult to focus with the format that Claire was using,

695

as well as they felt it was impersonal and did not connected to their pace of learning. It seems that Claire and

696

Sammi both struggled with Zoom, especially the breakout room feature, as the ERT teaching platform.

DISCUSSION
We contextualized support and barrier categories within the COI framework by illustrating the positive and

700

negative influences on teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence (Figure 2). Our data shows the

701

importance of providing supports to enable instructors and students to maintain strong teaching, social, and

702

cognitive presence. Without these supports, there are potential impacts on work-life balance and mental health of

703

faculty and students.

704
705

Teaching presence

706

Teaching presence is defined as “the design, facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social processes

707

for the purpose of realizing personally meaningful and educational worthwhile learning outcomes” (Anderson et

708

al., 2001a). One of the themes we considered a support for teaching presence was ‘tools and support for class

709

content.’ Having communication tools and the right technology was critical for both students’ and instructor’s

710

success during the transition to ERT. For example, several instructors mentioned how their early access to

711

technology allowed them to quickly transition from in-person to remote. This quick transition helped them

712

maintain their teaching presence. In contrast, the instructors that had difficulties with technology, such a delays

713

getting Zoom licenses or poor internet connection fell under the theme ‘structures getting in the way.’ This theme

714

of ‘structures getting in the way’ directly hindered instructors’ ability to provide and maintain a consistent teaching

715

presence, thereby hindering student’s ability to experience a strong teaching presence.

716

An example of a support category we considered an influence on teaching presence was the category

717

‘prior experience.’ We defined prior experience as “knowledge, skills, and experiences before the start of ERT.”

718

For example, instructor Diane said: “We did an interview with a Skype scientist, and Zoom worked really well for

719

that, because I was already using Skype, so I just transitioned to that platform,” which indicates her prior

720

knowledge with Skype was a contributing factor to her ability to quickly transition to ERT, and it allowed her to

721

maintain her teaching presence, largely unchanged, for that aspect of the course. Additionally, Diane’s prior

722

knowledge was a support in the switch to ERT because it allowed her to maintain meaningful learning outcomes

723

for her students.

724

In contrast, an example of a barrier category we considered a negative influence on teaching presence was

725

‘instructor’ technology issues.’ This category was defined as “the inability for instructors to have access to

726

hardware and software” and we observed its impact on instructor ability to maintain teaching presence. For

727

example, Roberto described how this barrier impacted him:

728
729
730
731
732
733
734
735

Unlike Diane, Roberto encountered significant issues with technology in his teaching. He felt that his lack

736

of technology at home created a barrier to providing his students with worthwhile educational experiences. Better

737

access to technology would have allowed Roberto to improve his teaching presence for students. Here we see the

738

student Jax having trouble with technology.

Even with some of the adjustment is—I’ve recorded some of my videos on Zoom and using a
whiteboard or whatever. A lot of students are asking me, “Can you write a little better?” “I’m
trying to do it a little better, but it’s hard.” Something that would take me to write something on a
piece of paper or write something on a board is taking me 10 times longer. It’s 10 times more
inefficient mainly because I don’t have the technology at home. ---Roberto

They describe how lack of internet and unreliable technology led to their lack of motivation during class.

747

of teaching presence supports and

748

barriers than the other two elements of

749

the COI framework. Additionally,

750

knowing that the relationship between

751

barriers and supports is important, we

752

suggest that well developed student

753

cognitive presence could lead to an

754

extension of students learning and

755

capabilities (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Scaffolding in learning contexts for students.
Predicted student outcomes. The top left quadrant, ‘demands too high;
failure likely’ is when barriers or challenges are not met with equal
support, leading to a likely failure for the student. The lower left
quadrant ‘low motivation; boredom and behavior/problems likely’ is
generally seen when challenges and supports are both too little. The
lower right quadrant ‘comfortable/easy; little learning likely’ is when
challenges are too low but supports are high. The last quadrant, the
upper right is when challenges or barriers and supports are equal
leading to an ‘extension of learning and capability’

Social presence
Social presence is “the ability of learners to project their personal characteristics into the community of

759

inquiry, thereby presenting themselves as ‘real people’”. The ‘community’ category within the theme of ‘mental

760

and emotional support’ was something both students and instructors mentioned as important in their transition to

761

ERT. Instructors discussed things like having a support group to allow them to learn from others and having

762

friends to vent to about their frustrations. Having a sense of community provided a basis for social presence in that

763

in our study we considered instructors as learners as well as students. Instructors in ERT were learning how to

764

teach remotely in a pandemic; therefore, instructors’ social presence was also something important to consider in

765

our analysis.

766
767
768
769
770
771
772
773

Another category that aligned with social presence was ‘student comfort interacting online’, which was
defined as “using communication tools and modalities familiar to students.”

I found that the students were very engaged. It didn’t really puzzle them, this remote instruction to
online. They were already prepared for it in other classes and the students are all doing very well
in this class. ---Aarush
Instructor Aarush described that his students’ familiarity with online classes allowed them to be more

774

engaged, and thereby increased their social presence. However, other instructors saw a decrease in student social

775

presence as the semester progressed:

776
777
778
779
780
781
782

And then I guess, yeah, towards the end or towards the middle and the end of the semester, we
started seeing less participation, except for those few students that were still engaged. Yeah. So I
don’t know. It was crazy because, in the beginning, we’re like, all right, yeah, we got this kind of
thing. But then at the end, people were like, ah. ---Katherine
Instructor Katherine’s students’ enthusiasm and engagement decreased towards the end of the semester.

783

This barrier to ERT was categorized as ‘student presence and participation,’ which was defined as the “inability of

784

students to attend or participate in class, office hours, or course activities.” We argued that lack of student presence

785

and participation decreases student’s social presence.

786
787

Cognitive presence

788

Cognitive presence is defined as “the extent to which learners can construct and confirm meaning through

789

sustained reflection and discourse.” The support theme ‘mental and emotional support’ was important because

790

poor mental health and distractions impacted motivation to explore course content, the first component of cognitive

791

presence. For example, the support category ‘work from home’ allowed for personal support from spouses and

792

pets, didn’t clearly indicate that there was an impact on teaching or social presence, but it clearly had an impact on

793

instructors’ ability to teach during ERT.

794

For example, instructor Martin described how working from home allowed him to feel supported, “And, of

795

course, informal support in mental issues, well, my spouse and my pets were really imperative to keep me sane.”

796

Despite this category not pertaining to teaching or social presence, it is still particularly important in describing

797

experiences during the transition to ERT. Mental health, critical to both instructor and student success, has been

798

shown to play a significant role in the lives of many during the COVID-19 pandemic (Copeland et al., 2021;

799

Kecojevic et al., 2020; Roman, 2020).

800

Many instructors found it difficult to manage a proper work-life balance as shown in the barrier category

801

‘instructor emotion,’ which was defined as “frustration, fatigue, and guilt due to remote delivery.” Instructor Claire

802

described, “There were multiple days where, if I did shower, it was at 3 in the afternoon and I was sobbing in the

803

shower because I just couldn’t see it getting any better, and still try to maintain quality.” Claire’s struggle to

804

maintain a separation between work and home life, coupled with her feelings of hopelessness, did not align with

805

teaching or social presence, but might have impacted how she engaged with ERT.

CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have examined the perceived supports and barriers that affected instructors and students

809

during the rapid transition to ERT resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 31 STEM instructors were

810

interviewed about supports and barriers that they had experienced during the ERT transition, and interview

811

transcripts were analyzed via two-cycle quantitative analysis process drawing from grounded theory methods. This

812

process led to the identification of 134 unique supports that were collected into 12 categories, best represented by

813

the themes 1) Tools and support for class content; 2) Mental/emotional support; and 3) Preexisting support.

814

Similarly, instructors described 203 unique barriers that we collected into 14 categories, best represented by the

815

themes 1) Tools and support for class; 2) Spending more time and effort; and 3) Affective issues.

816

At the same time, 69 undergraduate students in STEM classes were surveyed about supports and barriers

817

that they had experienced during the ERT transition. The student survey responses were analyzed by inductive

818

coding, using the codes identified during the instructor analysis. The most important support categories identified

819

by students were ‘course attributes’, followed by ‘technology for remote teaching’ and ‘community’. The biggest

820

barriers identified by students fell into the ‘instructional space’ category, followed by the ‘student emotion and

821

comfort’ category and the ‘student presence and participation’ category.

822

Considering these supports and barriers in the COI framework, we found that some faculty found ways to

823

maintain a strong teaching presence and a healthy work-life balance, but most of these supports were local and

824

existed prior to the transition. Despite institutional efforts most of the broad, large-scale supports that faculty

825

identified were logistical in nature and primarily helped the faculty to maintain a strong teaching presence. While

826

faculty may not be familiar with the COI framework, they all recognized the importance of maintaining a strong

827

teaching presence and facilitating a strong social presence for students. However, most of the faculty identified

828

several barriers that prevented them from maintain and facilitating teaching and social presences. In addition, most

829

instructors had trouble maintaining a healthy work-life balance and found the transition to be extremely stressful.

830

All of this suggests that either 1) the supports provided by the institution were not meeting the instructor and

831

student needs or 2) the instructors and students were unaware of institutional supports. None of the instructors or

832

students identified institutional supports that helped them maintain a healthy work-life balance nor supported them

833

in maintaining a strong social presence during ERT. Following this, recommendations for future emergencies for

834

universities could include either more supports for instructors and students, such as greater access to free

835

technology, both software and hardware as well as increased access to reliable internet bandwidth, or, finding

836

better ways to disseminate where and how to get these supports. Additionally, maintaining a healthy work-life

837

balance is vital for everyone. Increased workload was cited by many students and instructors as a significant

838

struggle they faced. It is crucial that universities find ways to help alleviate this added strain, whether it be through

839

hiring additional staff to create things like laboratory instructional videos or simply lowering expectations so that

840

instructors and students that have family obligations directly stemming from the pandemic can attend to them.

841

Additional time for transitions for preparation of new online course material or training for students to become

842

more familiar with remote platforms would also be helpful.

843
844
845

Limitations and future directions
We acknowledge that there are several factors that limit our study; however, these limitations provide

846

opportunities for future studies. First, we conducted a convenience sample at only one MSI, UC Merced, so there is

847

limited generalizability. Also, we did not employ a systemic approach to ensure even distribution of faculty and

848

students across STEM disciplines at our institutions, so there were more chemistry and biology participants based

849

on the departments of the co-authors. In particular, the students surveyed were from only four of the 31 instructors

850

interviewed. As the transition to ERT during the COVID-19 pandemic was a one-time event, we will not be able to

851

collect more data from other MSIs or within UC Merced to see if our patterns persist in different study contexts or

852

with more participants. It might be possible to work with other MSI’s that conducted similar work and compare

853

our survey data for patterns. Second, this study focuses on self-report survey and interview data that is often

854

perceived as less objective compared to well-developed and validated classroom observation protocols (AAAS

855

2013). A risk of surveys and interviews is that the participants inaccurately self-report their teaching and learning

856

experiences, limiting the conclusions that can be made from these data. Our future work aims to triangulate the

857

self-report survey and interview data with classroom observations and student learning gains data (i.e., concept

858

inventories) to better understand classrooms interactions and student learning. Third, this study only described the

859

perceived supports and barriers through the transition to ERT, not the continuation of it. Therefore, we collected

860

instructor interview data at the end of the Fall 2020 semester to better understand what served as supports and

861

barriers for instructors during the continuation of ERT. Taken together, we found there are more barriers than

862

supports and that increased resources and communication between students, TAs, staff, faculty, and administration

863

could help mitigate future emergency remote hardships and experiences.
