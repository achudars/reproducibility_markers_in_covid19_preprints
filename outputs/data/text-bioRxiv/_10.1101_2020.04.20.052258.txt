Abstract: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory
disease COVID-19 which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Meanwhile,
increased demand in testing has led to shortage of reagents, supplies, and compromised the
performance of diagnostic laboratories in many countries. Both the world health organization (WHO)
and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend multi-step RT-PCR assays
using multiple primer and probe pairs, which might complicate interpretation of the test results
especially for borderline cases. In this study, we describe an alternative RT-PCR approach for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be used for the probe-based detection of clinical isolates in
the diagnostics as well as in research labs using a low cost SYBR green method. For the evaluation,
we used samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and performed RT-PCR
assays along with successive dilutions of RNA standards to determine the limit of detection. We
identified an M-gene binding primer and probe pair highly suitable for quantitative detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA for diagnostic and research purposes.

1. Introduction
In early January 2020, the novel severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered to
be the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was first
detected in late December in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020) and was recently declared a pandemic
by WHO (WHO, COVID-19 Situation Report – 51, published March 11th, (2020). We also observed a
sharp increase of cases in Germany and containment measures were imposed to slow the
progression. Detecting cases is difficult, as the disease is both very contagious, and can be clinically
unremarkable in individuals shedding the virus (Hoehl et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020). Therefore,
testing of suspected cases is of central importance but it is also required to guide patient care, and to
apply appropriate hygiene measures in the hospitals to restrict nosocomial spread among patients

and medical personnel (Klompas, 2020). The pandemic however, poses unprecedented challenges
for institutions conducting the virologic testing, as measures of public health as well as patient care
depend on timely, reliable results.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the gold standard in the
detection of SARS-CoV-2. Distinct qRT-PCR testing protocols were swiftly established and made
publicly available by the WHO (Corman et al., 2020), and by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
(CDC, 2020).
The protocol published by Corman et al. was designed before virus isolates were available and
recommends a two-step process (Corman et al., 2020). In this workflow, the initial screening test is
conducted with non-SARS-CoV-2-specific primers binding in the E-gene region coding for the
Envelope small membrane protein. The confirmation of the E-gene positive samples should then be
re-tested using primer pairs binding to the corona virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP),
which is specific in combination with a probe (P2) but less sensitive (Konrad et al., 2020). Here, the
specificity of the confirmatory test relies on the probe target sequence, which has two mismatches
compared to SARS-CoV and contains two wobble positions most likely hampering the sensitivity
(Table 2). The CDC operates with a distinct protocol targeting three different regions within the Ngene encoding for the viral Nucleoprotein (CDC, 2020). In both protocols, multiple probes and primers
are used in a multi-step PCR workflow, which is laborious and might also complicate interpretation of
the results. In light of the current shortage of reagents, personnel, and equipment, a one-step PCR
protocol achieving both high sensitivity and specificity would be beneficial for facing the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Optimized methods for both diagnostic and preemptive testing are essential to prevent
the worst-case situation.
In this study, we designed an alternative PCR approach specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA with primers binding in the M-gene encoding for the viral Membrane protein. This novel primer
pair exerts a higher specificity than the E-gene protocol, but has significantly better sensitivity when
compared with the RdRP-based PCR. As our approach requires fewer reagents and less-hands on
time, it can be advantageous for early virus detection.

2. Results
2.1. Evaluation of specific PCR approaches for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
In several laboratories, non-specific PCR products in both SARS-CoV-2 negative patient samples
and in the non-template control (NTC) using the WHO recommended SARS-CoV E-gene specific
PCR (Corman et al., 2020) have been reported (Konrad et al., 2020) (personal communication). In
order to confirm and further characterize these non-specific products in negative samples, we carried
out additional PCR-based analyses. To this end, RNA from pharyngeal swab samples (Table 1) was
isolated and subjected to WHO recommended qRT-PCR analysis using E (Figure 1a) and RdRP
(Figure 1b) gene specific primers (Table 2). As positive controls we used RNA extracted from
pharyngeal swabs of one asymptomatic, one mildly symptomatic passenger returning from Wuhan
after initial quarantine (Figure 1, Table 1), (Hoehl et al., 2020). Both viral samples were passaged on
Caco2 cells as described previously (Bojkova et al., 2020) and the resulting virus containing
supernatants (FFM1 and 2) were used for subsequent analysis.

Four out of 48 (8.33%) tested swab samples showed a positive signal in the E-gene PCR (Figure
1a), which were of the same size as the specific amplicons (data not shown). However, the
confirmatory RdRP-gene PCR was negative for all patient samples except the positive control (Figure
1b). This data indicates that using the two-step WHO PCR protocol might complicate interpretation
of the test results especially for cases with higher Cq-values.

Since the RdRP-gene PCR is more specific than the E-gene PCR but is also described as less
sensitive (Konrad et al., 2020), we aimed to develop a novel approach using specifically designed
primer and probe pairs. For optimal primer design consensus sequences were aligned to the
reference SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and analyzed for primers binding in E, N, Orf1, M, and S
regions (Supplementary Figure 1) that would allow SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV amplification.
For experimental confirmation, we used human SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt 1 (NC_004718) and
SARS2-CoV-2 RNA samples (FFM1 and FFM2) and compared the PCR performances using serial
dilutions (Supplementary Figure 1a). Due to limited linearity, E and N gene specific primers were
excluded from further analysis while S and M gene based PCRs (Table 1), which were more sensitive
than Orf-1 (Supplementary Figure 1b), proved to be suitable for linear SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection
including samples with low viral loads (~Cq 40) (Supplementary Figure 1c). Since M gene PCR was
superior by approximately Cq 1.73 +/- 0.26 earlier detection (Cq 1.48 +/- 0.15 for SARS-CoV,
Supplementary Figure 1d), we continued with M gene PCR and further characterized the limit of
detection.

Using plasmid DNA constructs that harbor the conserved SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequences, we
generated standard curves and compared the M-gene PCR (Figure 2b) with the established WHO
RdRP-gene PCR approach (Figure 2a). Using the same dilution series of plasmid samples, the M
gene based method allowed earlier detection (Figure 2c). To determine the analytical sensitivity of
the M-gene based approach, we additionally used in vitro-transcribed RNA standards and tested four
replicates to determine the limit of detection (Figure 2d-f). We were able to detect a single RNA copy
per reaction by M-Gene qRT-PCR. SYBR-green based melting curve analysis revealed a melting
point at 80°C for all samples (Supplementary Figure 2). To further characterize the capacity of M-

gene PCR to detect high viral loads, we performed SYBR-green based PCR and quantified high loads
of virus cell culture supernatants (Supplementary Figure 2d).
In order to confirm that the M-gene specific PCR primers and probes cover all known isolates and
thus enable detection, an alignment of published SARS-CoV-2 full-length isolates known at the time
of submission (n = 165) and viral isolates sequenced during this study was carried out (Figure 3,
Supplementary Figure 3). Both forward and reverse primers had a 100% identity and only one
isolate of 165 (0.006%) had a mismatch to the consensus sequence C/T) at position 18 of the DNA
probe (Figure 3). However, this mismatch would not affect the detection, but possibly reduce the
sensitivity but not prevent binding of the probe.

In conclusion, our M-gene based qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was at least as specific
as the RdRP PCR recommended for confirmation by the WHO, but showed a significantly higher
sensitivity. Importantly, unspecific signals as observed in the E-gen PCR were not detected.

2.3. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical and research samples using E-, RdRP-, and M-gene
specific protocols

In order to validate our method, we re-tested clinically relevant samples that have been qualitatively
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA during routine diagnostics (Supplementary Table 1). WHO
recommended RdRP primer pairs were used for confirmation. As negative controls we included 8
negative samples (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). As described above, unspecific E-gene
amplicons were detected in a test kit specific manner possibly due to the reagents used (Konrad et
al., 2020). Therefore, we additionally compared the performances of two research kits (New England
Biolabs) and one in vitro diagnostic (IVD) certified test kit (Roche Viral Multiplex RNA Kit) using Mgene and RdRP-gene primers. Overall, we observed lower Cq values with all three kits for M-gene
when compared to RdRP-gene PCR (Figure 4). Using the Luna OneStep Probe kit (Luna Universal
Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit, NEB) M-gene PCR was significantly more sensitive among all tested
kits with a difference of approx. 10 Cq values Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit in
comparison to the RdRP specific primer pairs. With the SYBR green based kit (Luna Universal OneStep RT-qPCR Kit) and Roche IVT kit (LightCycler® Multiplex RNA Virus Master) we observed four
and one Cq value differences respectively, verifying that detection of M gene is superior to RdRPgene PCR. To further evaluate whether the newly developed method is also suitable for detecting
intracellular virus RNA, we infected Vero and Caco2 cells with SARS-CoV-2 strain FFM1. Using Mgene PCR we were able to detect very low copy numbers of viral RNA in infected Vero cells, while
RdRP-gene PCR was limited in sensitivity (Figure 5a). Furthermore, we infected Caco2 cells and
performed an intracellular replication curve and monitored viral replication and genome copy
numbers, respectively. Viral RNA was detectable at the time points 3, 6, 12, and 24 h post infection
in a linear fashion (Figure 5b-c).

In conclusion, non-specific PCR products and limited sensitivity pose a major problem using the WHO
protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection and could lead to numerous unnecessary confirmation tests. Our
newly developed PCR protocol is suitable to save time and resources since pre-screening is no longer
necessary. Thus, this approach might be used as a cost-effective alternative to the E- and RdRPbased protocol.

3. Discussion
Countermeasures against COVID-19 depend on testing with the highest sensitivity and specificity
possible. We and others (Konrad et al., 2020) (personal communication) determined certain
drawbacks in the two-step PCR protocol recommended by the WHO as unspecific signals for E-gene
PCR may arise due to combination of several factors including primer dimers, unspecific binding of
the primers and probes, RT-PCR kit and thermocycler dependent differences. In commercially
available kits, primers and probes, as well as the buffers and enzyme quantities and properties have
been matched to one another to reduce unspecific amplification (Konrad et al., 2020). In times of
increasing reagent shortages, however, a simple protocol should be available that can be quickly
adapted with universal test kits (including research kits) and is easy to evaluate would be beneficial.
In this study, we evaluated several primer and probe pairs designed in silico and identified M-gene
specific primer and probe (Table 2) to be highly versatile for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a large
selection of samples. We analyzed samples from patients presented with different symptoms, viral
loads and degree of infection (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) and compared isolates with
varying demographic characteristics originating from several infection clusters (Table 1).
Interestingly, via sequence comparison based on the phylogenetic analysis we were able to show
that isolate FFM5 with unknown origin shows a high degree of relationship to the FFM1 isolate from
China indicating the same origin (Figure 3). Anyway, the SARS-CoV-2 M-gene PCR was able to
detect SARS-CoV-2 from all clusters.
In a direct comparison of the RdRP PCR recommended by the WHO and the M-Gen PCR developed
in this study, the M-Gen PCR was superior in terms of sensitivity using multiple test kits. Since we
used primers that specifically bind SARS-CoV-2 RNA, this was to be expected. The reduced
sensitivity of the WHO recommended RdRP-PCR may be explained by the presence of wobble pairs
(Table 2) in the primer and probe sequences (Corman et al., 2020). Nevertheless, in a situation of
crisis, where the availability of reagents, equipment as well as labor of qualified personnel are limited,
a reliable and convenient one-step PCR protocol with optimum sensitivity would be beneficial.
Our comparison analysis for M- and RdRP-gene PCR were consistent and reproducible for detecting
RNA from progeny virus particles and also intracellular viral mRNAs extracted from infected Caco2
and Vero cells even if some of the subgenomic viral mRNAs do not harbor the target sequence (Kim

et al., 2020). We also have shown that the method is also suitable for inexpensive SYBR-green based
PCR assays (Supplementary figure 2d). Thus, M gene PCR allows the quantification of very low
and very high viral loads.

4. Materials and Methods
Cell culture and virus preparation
Caco2 and Vero cells (African Green monkey kidney) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium
(MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml of penicillin and 100 g/ml of
streptomycin. SARS-CoV-2 isolate (Frankfurt 1 was obtained from throat swab of a patient diagnosed
with SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized in the isolation unit of Frankfurt University Hospital (Germany) (Hoehl
et al., 2020). SARS-CoV isolate FFM-1 was isolated from patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV infection
in 2003 at Frankfurt University Hospital (Drosten et al., 2003). SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Caco2 cells using MEM, while SARS-CoV was grown in Vero cells both using with 1% FCS Virus stocks
were stored at -80°C. Viral titers were determined by TCID50 or qRT-PCR. In accordance to the
decision of the Committee on Biological Agents (ABAS) and Central Committee for Biological Safety
(ZKBS) all work involving infectious SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was performed under biosafety
level 3 (BSL-3) conditions in a BSL-3 facility. For intracellular RNA testing, 1x 105 Vero cells were
seeded per well in a 12-well plate. Cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV suspension
at an MOI of 0.1 for one hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. Subsequently cells were rinsed with PBS, replenished
with fresh media and incubated for another 7 days before harvesting for RNA extraction.
For time point analysis, Caco2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.01 MOI) in MEM media
supplemented with 1% FCS, at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were harvested for RNA extraction 0, 3, 6, 12
and 24 h post infection using TRI Reagent (Sigma). Following chloroform extraction and isopropanol
precipitation, RNA was dissolved in nuclease free water and treated with DNase I (Qiagen) for 15 min
at 37°C. DNase I treated RNA was subjected to RT-PCR analysis.

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from cell culture supernatant samples was isolated using AVL buffer and the
QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intracellular RNAs were

isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. RNA was subjected to
OneStep qRT-PCR analysis using Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) or
Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) or LightCycler® Multiplex RNA
Virus Master (Roche) using CFX96 Real-Time System, C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. Primer pairs
for E-, S- and M-gene specific PCRs were used in equimolar concentrations (0.4 µM each per
reaction). For RdRP-primer pairs were used according to Corman et al. (Corman et al., 2020) with
0.6 µM and 0.8 µM for forward and reverse primers, respectively. The cycling conditions were used
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for SYBR green and probe based Luna Universal
One-Step RT-qPCR Kits, 2 µl of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription performed at 55°C for
10 minutes. Initial denaturation was 1 min at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of denaturation for 10
seconds, extension for 30 seconds at 60°C. Melt curve analysis (SYBR green) was performed from
65-95°C with an increment of 0.5°C each 5 seconds. For IVD approved LightCycler® Multiplex RNA
Virus Master (Roche) 5 µl of template RNA were used. Reverse transcription was performed at 55°C
for 10 minutes. Initial denaturation was allowed for 30 seconds at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of
denaturation for 5 seconds, extension for 30 seconds at 60°C and final cool-down to 40°C for 30
seconds. The PCR runs were analyzed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager software version 3.1 (Bio Rad
Laboratories).

Primer Design
For primers design and validation 165 available SARS-CoV-2 full-length sequences were aligned
using NCBI Virus Variation Resource (Hatcher et al., 2017) and a consensus was made with 99%
identity cutoff. Primer3 and Geneious Prime® software version 2020.0.5 (Biomatters Ltd.) were used
to design primer and probes matching the consensus sequence. Oligo characteristics were calculated
using a modified version of Primer3 2.3.7. Positions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome according to
accession number MN908947. Illustration were made with Geneious software.

Generation of DNA and RNA standard curves
Standard curves were created using plasmid DNA harboring the corresponding amplicon target
sequence according to GenBank Accession number NC_045512. For in vitro transcription,

pCR2.1 based plasmid DNA (pCR2.1 SARS-CoV-2 M (475-574)) was linearized with BamHI. In vitro
transcription was carried out using the HiScribeT7 High Yield kit (NEB) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance-based measurement of the RNA yield was performed using
the Genesys 10S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

Illumina NGS Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates
Caco2 cells were infected with different viral strains (FFM1-FFM7) at an MOI 0.01. Cell culture
supernatant was harvested 48 h after infection, precleared at 2000xg for 10 min at room temperature.
Virus particle containing supernatant (20 ml) was overlaid on 25% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at
26,000 rpm for 3 h at 4C using SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Pellets were dissolved in PBS
overnight at 4C and 1/3 of used for RNA was extraction using Macherey Nagel Virus RNA isolation
kit without carrier RNA according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The libraries were
prepared and sequenced by GenXPro GmbH, Frankfurt a. M., Germany. Briefly, quality was
controlled on a LabChip GXII platform and RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra
II Directional RNA-Seq kit according to the manufacturers recommendations. Sequencing was
performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using 75 cycles. Read mapping was performed using
