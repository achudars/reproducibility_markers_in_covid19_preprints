Abstract

13

SARS-COV-2 and all other coronaviruses express its 3 prime genes by forming sub-genomic RNA. As

14

the genome of these virus exist in RNA form, only by profiling the relative abundance of these sgRNAs, can

15

the viral transcriptome be revealed. Utilizing publically available meta-transcriptomic data generated from

16

patient samples, we were able to infer the viral transcriptome in vivo, which is distinct from the in vitro one

17

derived from cell culture. Inter-sample diversity was also observed and a sample specific transcript was

18

identified. By doing the same analysis to MERS and SARS data, we were able to compare the three in terms

19

of transcription. Among the differences, SARS-COV-2 has significantly elevated expression of the Spike gene,

20

which may contribute to its high transmissibility.

Highlights

23

1) The in vivo transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by sgRNA profiling, for 25 patient samples around

24
25
26

the globe.
2) The Spike protein expression is an order of magnitude higher in SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV or SARSCoV, possibly contributing to the virus’ elevated transmissibility.

27

3) The in vivo SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes, as inferred from human patient data was distinct from the in

28

vitro one derived from cell line culture, all the accessory genes were up-regulated in vivo, suggesting

29

intricate expression regulation mechanism for the small viral genome.

Introduction

32

COVID-19 has reached global pandemic levels since March 2020, brought unprecedented devastation

33

to human lives and to global economy as well [1]. Like other coronaviruses, the genome of SARS-COV-2, the

34

virus responsible for COVID-19, exists in the form of a single positive strand of RNA. Upon entrance into

35

host cells, the open reading frame (ORF) closest to 5’ end can be readily translated from the genome, in

36

reality this ORF is divided into two segments—ORF1a and ORF1ab, due to a ribosome skipping mechanism

37

involved [2]. All other 3’ ORFs, including ones coding for the structural proteins: S (Spike), E (Envelope), M

38

(Membrane) and N (Nucleocapsid) and a number of accessory genes, can only be translated by first forming

39

the so called sub-genomic RNAs or sgRNAs. These sgRNAs are formed by recombination of the 3’ portion

40

of the genome with a leader sequence of around 70 nt. The recombination is usually thought to be based

41

on a repetitive sequence called Transcription Regulation Sequence (TRS), Fig 1A.

42

The transcriptome of the virus is a fundamental aspect of its biology. For example, knowing which

43

accessory protein is expressed and in which strain can greatly help us combating it. Also in the 21 century,

44

two previous episodes of coronavirus outbreaks had plagued us: the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory

45

Syndrome) outbreak in 2003 and MERS (Mid-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2012. These two

46

outbreaks caused far fewer cases, 8071 and 2499 respectively, whereas the fatality rates were much higher,

47

9.6% for SARS and 37.0% for MERS, compared with a current estimate of 4.5% for SARS-COV-2 [1, 3, 4].

48

Studying the difference between the three can reveal valuable information on their different

49

transmissibility and virulence. But it’s currently lacking beyond clinical information or simple genome

50

comparison due to the difficulty in handling these deadly viruses.

51

Sequencing has played essential role in identifying this particular virus and are still contributing to the

52

diagnosis and strain typing to keep the spread and evolution of it under close monitoring [5, 6]. The vast

53

majority of these sequencing data come in the form of meta-transcriptomics sequencing, i.e. the

54

sequencing of the RNA of all organisms within a biological sample, mostly bronchoaveolar lavage fluid or

55

BALF. Usually the viral reads within these data were extracted and assembled or used to call SNPs, so the

56

underlying strain would be typed and compared to existing ones. Once sequenced, early annotation of the

57

viral genome were made based on sequence homology [5, 6]. However, homology alone does not warrant

58

expression of the underlying gene as these highly mutable RNA virus can have other sequence features

59

altered that rendering ORFs that looked intact not expressed. Recently, direct profiling of viral RNAs were

60

made using nanopore technology that revealed the transriptome of the virus, these study all used isolated

61

virus strain to infect VERO cells to generate the sample for sequencing [7-9]. In this paper, we turned to the

62

readily available public data. By profiling the sgRNA population underlying the data using an alignment

63

break point analysis method, we were able to reconstruct viral transcriptome in vivo for a large number of

64

samples, and study their diversity. Doing the same to MERS and SARS, we were able to compare the

65

transcriptomes of these human coronaviruses.

67

Results

68

As of 2020/03/31, there are more than 2800 viral genome sequences submitted to GISAID. However

69

there are only 11 Bioprojects containing almost 60 samples with raw data deposited in NCBI SRA. After

70

filtering out samples that contained too few viral reads and adding ones for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we

71

obtained 8 projects with 42 samples and 698 million Illumina reads in total, Supplementary Table 1. All the

72

SARS-Cov-2 samples came from human, while SARS and MERS ones came from mouse or cultured cells.

73

We developed an informatics pipeline to infer sgRNA profiles from these short reads samples. In short,

74

reads were first aligned to a combined reference of human (hg38) and either SARS-CoV-2 (GeneBank ID

75

MT121215.1), SARS (GeneBank ID NC_004718.3) or MERS (GeneBank ID NC_019843.3). The relative

76

abundance of the sgRNA species can then be inferred from alignment break point analysis. I.e. the reads

77

that derive from the 5’ end of the sgRNAs, when mapped to whole genome reference, will have one end

78

mapped to the 5’ leader and one end mapped far away from it, Fig 1A. See supplementary methods for

79

more details.

80

For SARS-CoV-2, there are 25 samples in total, between 2.99% and 99.97% of the reads were mapped

81

to SARS-CoV-2 (84.76% average, the large variation arose from different sequencing library construction

82

methods used). The sgRNA profiling identified 8 cannonical break points corresponding to 8 sgRNA species:

83

S, E, M, N, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF8, Fig1B. N is the most abundant at 28% of the canonical sgRNAs.

84

It’s followed by ORF7a, M, ORF3a and S, all just above 10%. E is the lowest of the eight at about 1%. All of

85

them also have TRS except E. The break point for these ORFs were situated between 9 to 146 nt upstream

86

of the ORF start, and have no start codon (ATG) in-between. ORF7b and ORF10 are two ORFs that were

87

supported in a recent proteomics study on SARS-CoV-2. However, we did not see supporting break

88

points/sgRNA in our first scan-through. We then looked extra hard by lowing our threshold. The few extra

89

break points emerged were still very far away from those ORF start or has out-of-frame start codon between

90

the break point and the ORF start. Thus ORF7b and ORF10 were not supported by our data, this could be

91

due to lack of read depth or difference between in vivo and in vitro situations.

92

We also examined a few well supported break point without corresponding canonical ORF annotations

93

and found a novel ORF starting at 22614, encoding a 36 amino acid peptide. This break point was only

94

identified in one of the samples but reached high frequency in it. Interestingly, this novel break point has

95

an underlying TRS that’s shifted several bases from the canonical one and all the samples contain this

96

shifted TRS. The underlying sample (SRA ID SRR11278164) has a genomic sequence differs from other

97

samples mostly at ORF1ab, suggesting replication/transcription machinery change rather than TRS

98

alteration contributed to this novel sgRNA. Although if this novel sgRNA or viral transcript was translated

99

or not remain to be seen.

are translated from their respective sgRNAs, as usually only one ORF is translated from a messenger RNA.

108

109

For SARS, there are 10 samples in total, between 0.10% and 55.37% of reads were mapped to

110

SARS(14.59% average). The number of 3’ ORFs annotated by homology alone is 12 while sgRNA profiling

111

suggest 8, Suppl. Fig 1. For MERS, there are 7 samples in total, between 0.04% and 96.21% of reads were

112

mapped to MERS (14.78% average). Homology alone suggest there is 9 3’ ORFs in this genome, while sgRNA

113

profiling suggest 7, Suppl. Fig 2. This makes MERS the one with fewest genes amongst the three. When the

114

annotation of the 3 viruses were compared, both homology based and sgRNA based, SARS comes closest

115

to SARS-CoV-2, as expected. Also, sgRNA evidence suggest both express 8 3’ ORFs, with an almost perfect

116

correspondence, with ORF8 from SARS-CoV-2 being the exception. It shares weak and partial homology

117

with SARS-CoV ORF8b, not the well express 8a, Fig 2A.

118

Since we have multiple samples for each of the three viruses, we can compare their transcriptome

119

across samples, Fig 2B. Note that after imposing a minimum break point read requirement, the number of

120

samples for the SARS-CoV-2 group was down to eight. The most striking different came from S. The relative

121

expression of S gene in SARS-Cov-2 is 14.8%, an order of magnitude higher than that in SARS and MERS,

122

1.6% and 1.25% respectively. We notice this difference is in accordance with the three’s capability to spread

123

among hosts: MERS being the most deadly, has a R0 of 0.69, SARS-CoV-2 having the lowest fatality rate,

124

spread very rapidly and SARS comes in between in terms of both transmissibility and fatality rate [10-12].

125

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both use ACE2 as the receptor for celluar invasion. Cryo-EM study suggested

126

that the SARS-CoV-2 has higher binding affinity to ACE2 [13]. Our study suggest yet another possibility. The

127

elevated S expression, may make an average SARS-COV-2 having more Spikes on surface or just assemble

128

more efficiently.

129

We also compared the recent in vitro transcriptome with our in vivo one, Fig 2B, green dashed lines.

130

An interesting observation is that all accessory genes were down-regulated in vitro. This could make

131

biological sense as in defenseless cultured cells, viruses devote more resource into reproduction, while to

132

cope with more host defense in vivo, accessory genes have to more important roles to play. This also

133

suggested there was intricate expression regulation mechanism at work here, even for this small 30 Kb

134

genome.

analysis; B) The sgRNA profiles of the 3 viruses compared; C) The heatmaps of the viral expression matrices,

141

showing clustering of samples as well as genes.

142
143

Lastly, we made clustered heatmaps for the viral transcriptome matrices, Fig 2C. The samples did not

144

cluster by Bioproject ID, suggesting low batch effect across a wide range of library processing methods,

145

validating this type of short reads break point profiling as relatively unbiased and the inferred transcriptome

146

can be compared. Clustering of the genes suggest that for SARS-CoV-2, the E gene and ORF6 gene were

147

highly correlated. Interestingly these two genes are of similar length, having similarly sized TRS and similar

148

sgRNA abundance.

Discussion

151

SARS-COV-2 were identified very early on by sequencing technology. The sequence data on this virus

152

were still generated in high volumes around the globe as of this paper. These sequencing data were so far

153

used mostly for strain typing the virus. This is an under-utilization of a valuable information. By developing

154

an informatics pipeline, we were able to infer the sgRNA populations from these data, essentially recover

155

the viral transcriptome. This present an added layer of information on top of the genome sequence. Our

156

results suggest that different strains of virus may even have a different repertoire of genes expressed,

157

highlighting the need for more in-depth case examination and individual patient care.

158

Spike protein received tremendous amount of research attention as it determines the host specificity

159

and receptor affinity thus transmissibility. Our result show that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene is highly

160

expressed in at least a large number of virus strains, on average an order of magnitude higher than SARS-

161

CoV or MERS-CoV. This may also contribute to the elevated transmissibility of this virus. Carefully controlled

162

electron microscopy comparison of these virion particles may be able to answer if the relative amount of

163

the Spike is really different

164

Finally, there are more than just viral information within this type of meta-transcriptomic data. Host

165

RNA and RNA from other microbes were also there, though not optimally captured. In a time of urgent

166

need, these valuable information should not be wasted, and could be made more useful if more

167

accompanying clinical information could be shared. Most GISAID entries for SARS-CoV-2 has a meta-

168

transcriptomic dataset behind it and currently GISAID entries far out-numbered the raw reads entries in say

169

SRA. Sharing these information will greatly help researchers study this virus and ultimately curb it.
