Abstract

35

Despite limited genomic diversity, SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide range of clinical

36

manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences

37

are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral

38

load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430

39

individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a

40

strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and

41

Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins.

42

SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host

43

response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days)

44

demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of

45

ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression

46

of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while

47

transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with

48

lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and

49

their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in

50

trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females,

51

males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-kB

52

signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data

53

demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time

54

course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in late 2019 from Wuhan, China, has

62

rapidly spread throughout the world, causing more than 6 million cases and 400,000 deaths

63

globally as of June 2020. COVID-19 morbidity and mortality has been overwhelmingly

64

concentrated in elderly individuals and those with preexisting comorbidities (1). In older

65

individuals, immunosenescence and dysregulated antiviral responses due to viral chronic low-

66

grade age-related inflammation may play an important role (2), as has been proposed for

67

influenza (3). Males are known to be generally more susceptible to infectious disease than

68

females (4) and SARS-CoV-infected male mice had increased infiltration of inflammatory

69

macrophages into their lungs, leading to a deleterious inflammatory response (5). Accordingly,

70

systemic inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein

71

were elevated in men who died of SARS-CoV-2 (6). However, the mechanisms behind increased

72

mortality among older adults and males with COVID-19 remain speculative.

73

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells depends on binding to the receptor ACE2 (7),

74

expressed at a high level in the nasal epithelium (8), then further induced upon exposure to

75

interferon (9), suggesting a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 exploits host antiviral responses.

76

SARS-CoV antagonizes initial viral detection and interferon responses by an as-yet unknown

77

mechanism (10,11). SARS-CoV-2 may employ similar mechanisms, as low MOI infections of

78

bronchial epithelial cells do not result in extensive transcription of interferon-stimulated genes

79

(ISGs) at 24 hours post infection (12). An important consequence of these observations is that

80

SARS-CoV-2 viral load and transmissibility peaks at the time of symptom onset (13,14). The

81

temporal relationship between viral load and host gene expression has not been fully explored.

82

In the United States, diagnostic testing is generally performed on nasopharyngeal (NP)

83

swabs, from which SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be recovered. Shotgun RNA sequencing of this material

84

allows for simultaneous recovery of viral genomes for transmission tracking as well as

85

understanding of in situ host response (15). Since the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA

86

in WA State, the University of Washington Virology Laboratory has performed shotgun RNA

87

sequencing to recover more than 1,000 viral genomes to understand the evolution and

88

molecular epidemiology of the virus (16,17). Here, we examine host specific gene expression

89

differences by SARS-CoV-2 infection status, host age, sex, and viral load in nasopharyngeal

90

swabs from 430 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and 54 negative controls.

91
92
93

Results
Since early March, 2020, the University of Washington Virology Laboratory has tested

94

more than 100,000 samples, primarily NP swabs, for infection with SARS-CoV-2 (18). Thousands

95

of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, as well as negative controls, have subsequently been

96

metagenomically sequenced, contributing to a detailed understanding of the phylogeny and

97

molecular epidemiology of the virus (16,19). In this study, we selected a subset of sequenced

98

samples that had sufficient reads (>500,000) pseudoaligned to the human transcriptome to

99

examine gene expression changes as a result of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

100
101
102

Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1.
We first characterized the genes most differentially expressed (DE) in the nasopharynx
as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=430 positive, 54 negative). After correcting for batch

103

effects, we found 83 differentially expressed genes (padj <0.1 and absolute log2FoldChange >1)

104

between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples, comprising 41 upregulated genes and 42

105

downregulated genes (Supplementary Table 1). Clustering of samples by the 50 most significant

106

DE genes reveals multiple gene expression clusters among SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, while

107

most negative samples cluster together (Figure 1A). Consistent with results from Butler et al

108

(20), SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an interferon-driven antiviral response in the nasopharynx,

109

upregulating transcripts encoding viral sensors (DDX60L), chemokines that attract effector T

110

cells and NK cells (CXCL9, 10, 11), and direct inhibitors of viral replication and function (MX2,

111

RSAD2, HERC5), highlighted in Figure 1B

112

To interrogate the global regulatory and signaling programs induced by SARS-CoV-2

113

infection, we employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (21,22) of the 50 Hallmark Gene

114

Sets of the Molecular Signatures Database (23). Sets with a significant (FDR < 0.05) positive

115

enrichment score included Interferon Alpha, Interferon Gamma, and Inflammatory Responses

116

(Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1A). Interestingly, we also found several metabolic pathways

117

negatively enriched, including both Oxidative Phosphorylation and Glycolysis, suggesting a

118

global reduction in production of proteins related to cellular energy production (Figure 1C,

119

Supplementary Figure 1B). Broad downregulation of transcripts encoding metabolic machinery

120

may represent either an antiviral response or viral-mediated disruption of host transcripts. We

121

also performed a statistical enrichment test against the Biological Processes Gene Ontology

122

(24,25). The most enriched processes (Supplementary Figure 1C-E) are related to either

123

immune responses or translation. In addition to upregulation of innate antiviral transcripts

124

(Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1D), we also found a consistent downregulation of transcripts

125

encoding ribosomal proteins (Supplementary Figure 1E).

126

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is an interferon-regulated gene and is upregulated in

127

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (8). We examined the relationship between viral load,

128

defined by the cycle threshold (Ct) of the N1 target during diagnostic PCR, and ACE2. We found

129

that ACE2 expression was associated with increased viral load: median counts of negative, low

130

viral load (N1 ct > 24), medium viral load (N1 ct 24-19), and high viral load (N1 ct < 19) were 0,

131

1.93, 3.45, and 7.82, respectively (p = 7.46e-13, by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA; Figure 2A). A

132

similar trend was found for other interferon-induced genes, a subset of which is shown in

133

Figure 2A including those significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection (CXCL9, OASL, MX1),

134

negative regulators of inflammation (CD274/PD-L1, USP18), monocyte chemoattractant

135

protein-1 (CCL2) (26). Conversely, the protease required for viral entry, TMPRSS2, was reduced

136

upon viral infection but was not modulated by viral dose, nor were ribosomal proteins (RPL4,

137

RPS6).

138

We next specifically examined gene expression differences between high (N1 ct < 19,

139

n=108) relative to low (N1 ct > 24, n=99) viral load samples. Figure 2B highlights the 15 most

140

upregulated and 15 most downregulated of the 363 total differentially expressed genes

141

(adjusted pvalue < 0.1, Supplementary Table 2). While genes upregulated in high viral load

142

samples were dominated by proinflammatory and/or interferon-induced factors such as

143

CXCL9/10, IDO1, and CD80, genes with higher expression in low viral load samples included

144

chemokines for neutrophils (CXCL8, S100A9), and B cell-specific transcripts (FCRL2, IGHG1,

145

IGHM, IGLL5, IGHG2, CD22). Because this suggested differences in immune infiltration as a

146

result of viral load, we performed in silico cell sorting of immune cells using CIBERSORTx (27)

147

and found a higher proportion naïve B and T cells, neutrophils, and M2-polarized macrophages

148

in low viral load samples (3.5, 2.2, 1.6, and 1.8 fold increased, respectively), while high viral load

149

samples contained a larger proportion of M1 macrophages, activated NK cells, and activated

150

dendritic cells (2.5, 1.6, and 1.6 fold upregulated, respectively; Figure 2C). Levels of transcripts

151

encoding B cell proteins and neutrophil chemokines varied by viral load (Figure 2D).

152

Detection of differential infiltration of antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes to the

153

nasopharynx in high vs low viral load samples highlights the role immune cells play in the host

154

response to SARS-CoV-2. To understand whether in vivo infection could be adequately

155

modeled in vitro, we examined gene expression differences in human airway epithelial (HAE)

156

cells 3 and 7 days post infection with SARS-CoV-2 and compared the DE genes at day 7 to those

157

from SARS-CoV-2 positive vs negative (Figure 1) and high vs low viral load SARS-CoV-2 positive

158

samples (Figure 2), resulting in a consensus set of 19 upregulated genes that define cell-intrinsic

159

host antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3A). When this consensus set was

160

tested for statistical enrichment in the DisGeNET (28) of disease ontologies, we found a high

161

degree of overlap with influenza signature genes (Figure 3B), including a number of interferon-

162

induced genes that mediate the acute antiviral response in the respiratory tract (Figure 3C).

163

Notably, in the HAE cells, there was no sign of induction of an interferon response at 3 days

164

post infection in spite of a 10-fold higher infectious dose of virus used and virus making up 0.3%

165

of reads. At 7 days post infection, SARS-CoV-2 comprised 5.3% of reads.

166
167

Observed heterogeneity in host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1A) may be a
result of co-infection or composition of the nasal flora. Proportion of reads assigned to virus,

168

bacteria, or human in Supplemental Figure 2A shows a range of bacterial:human ratio among

169

negative samples, while SARS-CoV-2 reads predominate at lower Ct values. Consistent with a

170

dramatic reduction in respiratory virus transmission (29), presumably due to physical distancing

171

measures enacted due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we found viral coinfections in only 14 of

172

430 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (3.25%), and a single SARS-CoV-2 negative patient with a viral

173

infection (2.5%) (Supplementary Figure 2B). We also found a number of samples enriched for

174

potentially pathogenic bacterial components of the nasal flora, particularly Moraxella

175

catarrhalis (RPM>100 in 3/37 (8.1%) SARS-CoV-2 negative, and 58/413 (14.0%) SARS-CoV-2

176

positive), although the clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. Even after SARS-

177

CoV-2 reads were subtracted from each sample, we found that high viral load samples had a

178

significantly lower burden of bacteria than mid or low viral load, or SARS-CoV-2 negative

179

samples (Mann Whitney p = 0.0014, 0.0067, 0.00028, respectively; Supplementary Figure 2C).

180

Infection time course may account for the observed differences in immune related

181

genes in high vs low viral load samples: Patients receiving repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing have a

182

reduced viral load over time (13,30,31). Although we do not have the ability to tie our data

183

from our large set of positive samples back to the onset of symptoms, we have seen gene

184

expression changes in a small set (n=3) of matched longitudinal samples with a mean elapsed

185

time of 6.3 days between collections and a mean increase in Ct value of 5.29, representing a 39-

186

fold reduction in viral load (Figure 4A). Enriched GO terms include those related to translation

187

and immune regulation (Figure 4B). Notably, in the second sample collected, we saw increases

188

in genes such as C1QA, -B, and -C and HLA-DQB1 that drive humoral immune responses and

189

those involved in wound healing (APOE, CD36, RHOC), as well as reductions in negative

190

regulators of each process (ie, TREM1, TFPI). We also tested the 19 SARS-CoV-2 signature genes

191

(Figure 3A), and found reductions in most at the second collection timepoint, although only

192

RSAD2, IFIT2, and HERC5 decreases were statistically significant with three samples. We also

193

saw a recovery in the expression of ribosomal proteins over time (Figure 4C). Analysis of data

194

from additional patients with more extensive

195

Clinically, COVID-19 cases tend to be more severe for older adults and males (1). No

196

significant difference in N1 Ct was observed based on age or sex (Figure 5A). To understand the

197

differences in host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the interaction between

198

infection and age (greater than 60), controlling for non-infection-related age differences with

199

SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. We found only two genes altered as a result of the interaction

200

between age and SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 30-fold reduction in production of CXCL11 (Figure

201

5B), an interferon-induced chemokine for natural killer and CD8+ T cells, and a 17-fold

202

reduction in polycomb group factor 6 (PCGF6) (Supplementary Figure 3A), a polycomb

203

repressor complex protein known to play a role in repression of dendritic cell activation (32).

204

Although we did not find additional genes altered specifically as a result of age in SARS-CoV-2

205

infection, we did find that CXCL9 and CXCL10 are not induced as strongly in SARS-CoV-2 positive

206

patients age 60 or higher. We also found reduced expression of the receptor for CXCL9/10/11,

207

CXCR3, the apoptosis-inducing factor GZMB secreted by NK and T cells, and the effector T cell

208

marker, CD8A. This data suggests that age-related T and NK cell dysfunction (33,34) may play a

209

role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in older individuals.

210
211

We performed a similar analysis to evaluate sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and
found a total of 19 genes for which the differences in expression based on sex could be

212

attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Supplementary Figure 3B highlights the top 10 non-

213

redundant enriched GO categories, most of which are related to immune function. In men, we

214

found downregulation of B cell-specific transcripts (IGHG1 and MSA4A/CD20), downregulation

215

of the NK-activating receptor SLAMF6, and an upregulation of several inhibitors of NFkB

216

signaling (NDRG1, ARRB2, CD300A, and NFKBID) (Figure 5D). The downregulation of B cell-

217

specific markers suggests differences in lymphocyte composition and/or trafficking in males.

218

Furthermore, the reduction in NK cell activating receptors and upregulation of negative

219

regulators of immune effector function, and resultant throttling of effector function, is

220

consistent with a more severe manifestation of COVID-19 in males.

221
222
223

Discussion
One of the hallmarks of COVID-19 is a dysregulated antiviral immune response. Studies

224

of SARS-CoV, which also employs ACE2/TMPRSS2-mediated entry, have demonstrated infection

225

does not always result in production of interferon-b in macrophages and dendritic cell (35), and

226

significantly delayed expression of type II or III interferon in lung cells (10). Moreover, infection

227

of BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV did not result in detectable IFNb until 24 hours, at which point

228

viral titers had nearly reached a peak; lung damage resulting from the subsequent massive

229

infiltration of inflammatory macrophages could be abrogated by pre-treatment with type I

230

interferons (11). Similar viral kinetics have been observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients

231

(13,14), and ferrets (12). Collectively, these results support a common mechanism by which

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.165225; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

232

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suppress intracellular viral detection and subsequent interferon

233

induction long enough for viral replication to occur.

234

Our transcriptomic analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs reveals the robust induction of an

235

interferon response by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1), similar to that observed by Butler et al

236

(20). The highest levels of individual interferon-responsive genes were seen in samples with the

237

highest viral load (Figure 2A) and enriched for transcripts associated with inflammatory

238

macrophages and activated DCs and NK cells, three primary sources of type I and II interferons

239

(Figure 2B). When repeat swabs were taken from patients with an average 6.3 day time period

240

between sampling, the interferon response had waned, as had viral load (Figure 4C). Notably, in

241

contrast to the robust expression of interferon-regulated transcripts in HAE seven days after

242

infection with SARS-CoV-2, there was limited evidence of induction of an interferon response

243

after only three days, consistent with a SARS-CoV-like functional repression of interferon

244

signaling.

245

COVID-19 patients frequently develop interleukin-6-driven cytokine release syndrome

246

(CRS), and elevated serum IL-6 correlates with respiratory failure and poor clinical outcomes

247

(36). Treatment with the IL-6 receptor blocking antibody tocilizumab has effectively treated

248

COVID-19 symptoms in some patients (37). We did not see a significant difference in expression

249

of IL-6, nor of other CRS-associated factors such as TNF or VEGF, when we analyzed SARS-CoV-2

250

positive samples relative to negative, nor in high vs low viral load SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.

251

This could be attributed to the nasopharynx not being a particularly sensitive anatomic location

252

to probe markers of systemic inflammation compared to serum or lower respiratory sites.

253

Additionally, our choice to use a large number of samples at relatively low sequencing depth

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.165225; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

254

likely reduced our sensitivity to detect differences in low-abundance and short-lived transcripts

255

like cytokines.

256

One of the more striking patterns we observed is the marked downregulation of

257

transcription of ribosomal proteins upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1B), and the recovery of

258

expression during disease progression (Figure 4C). Global inhibition of host transcription is a

259

strategy employed by many viruses via diverse mechanisms such as disrupting transcriptional

260

pre-initiation complex assembly (38,39) or cleavage of TATA-binding protein (40). MERS-CoV

261

and SARS-CoV nsp1 both cause decay of host mRNA (41,42); in MERS-CoV, host mRNA

262

degradation results from an endonucleolytic function of nsp1 itself (43). Nsp1 from SARS-CoV

263

and SARS-CoV-2 share 84% amino acid identity, therefore it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 can

264

also function directly or indirectly to promote host RNA degradation. Global downregulation of

265

host transcription may also be driven in part by SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 protein, which binds to the

266

mRNA export factor RAE1 and nuclear pore protein Nup98 in a similar manner as the VSV M

267

protein (44), or the ORF7a protein, which binds to proteins involved in ribosomal assembly and

268

nuclear export (44).

269

Metagenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples revealed a low rate of viral co-

270

infection (3.25%), consistent with 3.2% reported by Butler et al in New York City (20). This is

271

likely due to a dramatic reduction in circulating respiratory viruses in March and April 2020

272

caused by physical distancing measures across the country. Among the samples from which we

273

could obtain high quality metagenomic data, we found 46 of 413 SARS-CoV positive samples

274

but only 1 of 37 SARS CoV negative samples extensively colonized (RPM>1000) by potentially

275

pathogenic bacteria (Supplementary Figure 2B), although no pattern of infection was found

276

based on viral load. More work is required to understand how these normalized read count

277

thresholds for resident nasopharyngeal microbiota correlate with transitions from colonization

278

to mild illness to potentially invasive disease.

279

Finally, understanding age- and sex-related differences in responses to SARS-CoV-2

280

infection is of critical importance as approximately 90% of SARS-CoV-2 deaths in Washington

281

State have been seen in individuals over 60. Our data show that in individuals over 60,

282

expression of interferon-induced chemokines is reduced, possibly contributing to a reduction in

283

transcripts for cytotoxic T and NK cells. Immune dysfunctions in older individuals are well-

284

characterized (2,3,33,34), and likely contribute to poorer COVID-19 outcomes; results from

285

clinical trials of type I and III interferons in severely ill patients are likely to further define the

286

role of interferon signaling in older adults (45–47).

287

Differences in immune responses in males and females are due to a variety of factors,

288

including the effects of sex hormones and the X-linked nature of many immune genes (48). The

289

bias towards expression of B cell transcripts in females in our study is consistent with higher

290

levels of B cells in females regardless of age (49). Females also tend to have increased

291

inflammation in response to viral infections (4). The observed increased expression of

292

inhibitors of NFkB in males with SARS-CoV-2 may represent either inappropriate throttling of

293

the antiviral immune response or an adaptive mechanism to reduce deleterious inflammation,

294

a hallmark of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

295

Collectively, we demonstrate induction of an antiviral response characterized by type I

296

and II interferon induction, which wanes with time and is correlated with viral load. We also

297

find evidence of transcriptional repression by SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, we show that differences in

298

immune responses may underlie disparities in outcomes for two higher risk groups, males and

299

the elderly.

Methods

302

IRB Approval: Sequencing of excess clinical samples was approved by the University of

303

Washington IRB (STUDY00000408).

304

Sample Collection, RNA extraction, and qPCR: NP swabs of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-

305

2 infection were collected in 3 mL viral transport medium (VTM). Total RNA was extracted from

306

200 or 140 µL of VTM using either the Roche MagNAPure or Qiagen BioRobot automated

307

platforms, respectively (50). Quantitative PCR for the SARS-CoV2 N1 target was performed on

308

the Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR instrument (51,52).

309

Library preparation and sequencing: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was

310

performed as previously described (17,53). Briefly, 18 µL of extracted RNA was treated with

311

Turbo DNAse (ThermoFisher). First strand cDNA synthesis was completed using SuperScript IV

312

(ThermoFisher) and random hexamers (Invitrogen) followed by second strand synthesis by

313

Sequenase V2.0 (ThermoFisher). The resulting cDNA was purified using either the DNA Clean &

314

Concentrator kit (Zymo) or 1.6x volumes of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Library

315

preparation was performed using the Nextera XT Kit (Illumina). Libraries were cleaned with 0.7x

316

or 0.75x volumes of Ampure beads (Beckman Coutler), quantified using either the Qubit dsDNA

317

HS assay (ThermoFisher) or Quant-iT dsDNA HS assay (ThermoFisher), quality checked by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.165225; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

318

Bioanalyzer or TapeStation (Agilent), pooled, and sequenced on 1 x 75 bp runs on an Illumina

319

NextSeq or 1 x 101 bp runs on an Illumina NovaSeq.

320

Pseudoalignment: Raw FASTQ files were adapter and quality trimmed by Trimmomatic v0.39

321

(54) using the call “leading 3 trailing 3 slidingwindow:4:15 minlen 20”. Trimmed reads were

322

pseudoaligned to the Ensembl v96 human transcriptome using Kallisto v0.46 (55) assuming an

323

average library size of 300+/-100 base pairs. Only samples with more than 500,000

324

pseudoaligned reads were used for RNAseq analysis.

325

Differential Expression: Pseudoaligned reads were pre-filtered to remove any genes with

326

average expression of less than one read per sample, then normalized and differential

327

expression calculated with the R package DEseq2 v1.28.1 (56). Correction for batch effects was

328

incorporated into the design formula and modeling performed using the Wald test with outlier

329

replacement. Results were deemed significant at a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted pvalue <0.1.

330

Gene expression differences attributable to sex or age were incorporated into the design

331

formula as interaction terms.

332

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA): GSEA was performed on normalized counts on GSEA

333

Software version 4.0.3 (21,22). Gene ranking was generated with the Signal2Noise metric and

334

analyzed against the mSigDB Hallmarks v7.1 gene sets (23).

335

Metagenomics: Metagenomic analysis of the RNA sequence was performed using CLOMP

336

v0.1.4 (17) with the default options and visualized using the Pavian metagenomic explorer (57).

337

Viral species level taxonomical classifications with an RPM greater than 25 were confirmed via

338

BLAST v2.10.1 (e-value 1e-5).

Human Airway Epithelial (HAE) cultures. The EpiAirway AIR-100 system (MatTek Corporation)

340

consists of normal human-derived tracheo/bronchial epithelial cells that have been cultured to

341

form a pseudostratified, highly differentiated mucociliary epithelium closely resembling that of

342

epithelial tissue in vivo. Upon receipt from the manufacturer, HAE cultures were transferred to

343

6-well plates containing 1.0 ml EpiAirway medium per well (basolateral feeding, with the apical

344

surface remaining exposed to air) and acclimated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 hours prior to

345

experimentation.

346

Viral growth in HAE. HAE cultures were infected by applying 200 µl of EpiAirway phosphate-

347

buffered saline (MatTeK TEER Buffer) containing 2,000 PFU or 20,000 PFU of infectious clone-

348

derived SARS-CoV-2 expressing a stable mNeonGreen reporter gene (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) (58)

349

to the apical surface for 90 min at 37°C. At 90 min, the medium containing the inoculum was

350

removed, the apical surface was washed with 200 µl of TEER buffer, and cultures were placed at

351

37°C. Cultures were fed every other day with 1.0 ml medium via the basolateral side. Media

352

was removed, and cultures were lysed with TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher) at three days post

353

infection (20,000 PFU challenge) and at 7 days post infection (2,000 PFU challenge). Bam files of

354

viral sequence are deposited in the sequence read archive, NCBI Bioproject PRJNA634194.

355

HAE RNAseq and analysis: RNA from uninfected and infected HAE was extracted using Direct-

356

zol RNA MicroPrep (Zymo). Libraries were generated using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit

357

(Illumina) and 2x100bp paired-end reads sequenced on a Novaseq. Pseudoalignment using

358

Kallisto v0.44 and differential expression analysis was performed as above.

359

Statistics and visualization: All calculations were performed in R v4.0.0. Statistical enrichment

360

tests of Gene Ontology (24,25) and DisGeNET (28) pathways were performed in the
