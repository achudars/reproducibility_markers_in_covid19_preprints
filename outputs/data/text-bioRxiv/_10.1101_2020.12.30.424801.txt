Abstract
Effective therapeutics and stable vaccine are the urgent need of the day to combat COVID-19
pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response,
thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike
to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been
made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structurebased design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptidebiologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We
could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar
concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form
of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited
dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro.
CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement
of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any
steric hindrance. Taken together, we suggest that CSNP2 and CSNP4 are potent and stable
candidate peptides that can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike and possibly pose the virus to host
immune surveillance.

Background
Since its appearance in Dec 2019, COVID-19 has crippled the world economy and affected
almost every aspect of life. According to the WHO, ~82.5 million people have been infected and
~1.8 million lives have been claimed by COVID-19, by the end of year 2020. The shared research
data contribution and innovative vaccine development ideas by the scientists around the world,
led to the development of dozens of mRNA vaccine, two of which, mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2,
are approved by FDA (1, 2) on emergency basis and many are undergoing clinical trials (3). Sputnik
V vaccine developed by Gamaleya Research Institute” has been approved by the Ministry of
Health of the Russian Federationa and AZD1222, developed by AstraZeneca at Oxford University,
has been recently authorized by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA). The two vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer and BioNTech (BNT162b2) and
Moderna (mRNA-1273) have shown ~95% efficacy in their phase III clinical trials (1, 2). The
immune evasion-strategies utilized by SARS-CoV-2 make the vaccine and drug development
processes more difficult (4-6). SARS-CoV-2 exploits both structural and non-structural proteins to
perturb host immune response. Eight out of the 23 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 suppressed the
induction of type-1 interferon by Sendai virus, whereas S and NSP2 exhibited IFN induction (7).
SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the host ribosome (40S) and obstruct the mRNA entry, thereby
blocking the RIG-I-dependent IFN response (8). Many factors including mutation of the virus, halflife of the neutralizing antibodies, safety of vaccine, and above all, the availability of the vaccine
is of priority concerns in this scenario. The capacity of host adaptation by SARS-CoV-2 as
exemplified by the previous D614G mutation (9) and recent N501Y, D796H mutations in spike
are alarming and raised concerns over the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies response induced
by these vaccines that utilize wild type spike antigen (10).
Receptor recognition and cell-entry of the SARS-CoV-2 are requisite and hold high priority for
designing effective therapeutic interventions. The spike glycoprotein (S) is expressed as a trimeric
complex on the surface of virus, containing two subdomain S1 and S2 (11). The S1 domains
contains receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), binding domain (RBD), whereas the
S2 domain facilitates membrane fusion after the enzymatic cleavage of the S1 domain. The host-

dependent protease activation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry is a crucial determinant of its infectivity
and pathogenesis (12). Lysosomal proteases, including cathepsins and cell-surface expressed
type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2) play important roles in viral activation,
exhibiting an augmented effect on SARS-CoV-2 entry in the presence of furin (13). This structural
changes in the S protein allows the S2 domain for host-cell membrane fusion while the ACE2bound S1 domain sheds in the extracellular environment (14).
In the trimeric spike, the RBD switches between “up” and “down” conformations to facilitate
ACE2 binding and evade immune surveillance, respectively (11, 15). Masking of the RBD can lead
to the paradox of immune evasion with less infectivity of the virus. The D614G mutation in the
spike protein, is considered to have increased the “up” conformation and the overall density of
the spike protein at the surface of the virus. This makes the SARS-CoV-2D614G more infectious and
more sensitive to the neutralizing antibodies (14, 16). Hence, the spontaneous conformationswitching of the RBD represents a major challenge to develop neutralizing antibodies and
vaccines.
Detailed structural and protein-protein interfacial (PPI) insights in ACE2-RBD are fundamental
to design effective therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 (17, 18). PPI information and
decoy approaches have been used to design structurally constrained therapeutic peptides that
are able to retain their structures and efficiently grab the shallow surfaces at targets (19-21). A
peptide, S471–503, derived from the ACE2 binding region of the SARS-CoV RBD hinders the ACE2RBD interaction and viral entry into the cell (22). Another peptide against SARS-CoV constructed
by the glycine linkage of two separate segments (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) of ACE2 also exhibited
efficient antiviral activity (IC50 = 0.1 µM) (23). Corroborating this approach, a truncated 23-mer
(a.a. 21-43) peptide (SBP1) from the α1 helix of the ACE2 exhibited SARS-CoV-2 glycosylated-RBDbinding in nano-molar concentration (KD=47 nM) (24). However, this binding was only observed
in the insect-derived RBD, and the peptides did not show any binding to HEK cell-expressed or
other insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD variants. This imply that the 351-357 region contains
pharmacophores essential for the ACE2-RBD interaction. To further support the idea of peptide
antidotes against SARS-CoVs, Shuai et al. has reported a peptide EK1, derived from the HR2 motif

of the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV (25). Modification of this peptide with some lipid and
polyethylene glycol (PEG) could inhibit SARS-CoV-2-spike as well as host-cell fusion, therefore,
considered as pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor (26).
Recently, by collecting PPI knowledge and understanding the dynamics of the complex protein
interactions, we have designed effective therapeutic peptides (27-29). In the current study, we
attempted similar approaches to design structurally constrained peptides, which could address
the above-mentioned paradoxes of the spontaneous RBD-conformation switching and the
interaction of S1 with soluble and membrane bound ACE2. We and others have delineated the
ACE2-RBD interface and identified key residues that contribute to the binding strength of ACE2RBD (15, 17, 18, 30). Point mutation analyses could confirm that some of these residues are vital
to the ACE2-RBD interface (31). Collecting together these data, we could identify
pharmacophores on both ACE2 and RBD that are crucial to their binding. Taking advantage of the
possibility that some residues in the α1 helix of the ACE2 are sub-optimal for the RBD-binding
(32), these residues can be substituted to augment the ACE2-RBD binding. In consideration of the
crucial pharmacophores/hotspots and suboptimal residues, we designed short CoV-spikeneutralizing peptides (CSNPs) and demonstrated their effects on the S1-hACE2 binding in vitro.

Results
Design of the candidate CSNPs
We set up two strategies to design CSNPs to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike as well as address
the dilemma of reversible position-switching of the RBD and the masking of S1 by soluble ACE2.
First, the main scaffold of the α1 helix of ACE2, which is mainly involved in RBD-interaction, was
extracted as a starting structure to design and assemble helical CSNPs (CSNP1-3). Second, the
ACE2-interacting motifs of RBD were extracted and assembled into CSNP4 to restrict the RBD
movement and block its binding to ACE2.
ACE2 mainly utilizes polar and charged residues in its α1 helix to grab the RBD in its “up”
conformation (15) through salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds (Table 1). The first three amino
acids, Ile21, Glu22, and Glu23 in α1, are exposed to solvent without involving in the RBD binding;

nonetheless, these residues are attributable to establish the α1 helix. Five residues, Gln24, Asp30,
Lys31, Asp38, and Tyr41 were found as the major hotspots from α1 that contribute the highest
binding energy to the ACE2-RBD complex (Supplementary Figure 1A, Table 1). In addition to α1
helix, ACE2 utilize Lys353 to anchor to the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and shares the
second highest binding energy among the ACE2-RBD interface residues (Table 1). As the Lys353
lays at the hinge of β3-β4 that are stapled by a disulfide bond between Cys344 and Cys361, the
flexibility and freedom of this amino acid might be restricted. This allows the hydrogen-bondnetwork intact between ACE2 (Lys353) and RBD (Gly496, Gln498, and Gly502) (Figure 1A, Table
1). Together, we identified five pharmacophores i.e. Asp30, Lys31, Asp38, and Tyr41 in α1 and
Lys353 in β3-β4 that keep the ACE2-RBD intact (for simplicity four of them are shown in surface
electrostatic map in figure 1A). The COOH- group of Asp30 serves as hydrogen bond acceptor,
which is in the vicinity of NH3+ group of Lys417 of RBD. The NH3+ group of Lys31 of α1 lays
between the Glu35 of α1 and Glu484 of RBD and establishes salt bridge, alternatively. The COOHgroup of Asp38 in α1 is indispensable for the stability of Lys353 in ACE2 and it also makes crucial
contacts with Tyr449 and Gln498 of the RBD. The bulky side chains of Tyr41 occupies the
hydrophobic space between the a.a. 350-359 segment and the N-terminus of a.a. 21-46 segment
in peptide. Besides, the Tyr41-Thr500 hydrogen bond between ACE2 and RBD restricts the
rotation of Tyr41. The NH3+ group of Lys353 is very crucial pharmacophore with respect to the
ACE2-RBD interaction (Table 1).
For the helical peptides, the scaffold of α1 helix (a.a. 21-46) of ACE2 was truncated and linked
with the β3-β4 (a.a. 350-359) through a Gly-Pro-Gly (GPG) linker. The freedom of Lys353 was
restricted by creating an S-S bond between position D350C and F356C. We designed this peptide
as a parent peptide (CSNP1, Figure 1B). Next, the complementarity of the electrostatic surface
was examined, revealing potential points that could enhance the binding affinity between CSNPs
and RBD. Mutations of the potential residues were constructed with all possible permutation
under the consideration of the available volume, surface complementarity, total binding energy,
and stability of the complex. The resulting peptides database (81 mutants) with single
substitutions and their respective binding-affinities and binding stabilities were recorded and
utilized in next round of residues scan. The top five substitutions of each residue (i.e., Glu23,

Lys26, Thr27, His34, Gln42) were selected and implemented in multi-substitution peptides
construction step. Monitoring of their binding energies could identify the CSNP2 and CSNP2-1 as
the best fit peptides to the RBD interface (Supplementary Table 1). To retain their helicity, a
structural constraint (lactam bridge) was created between the side chains of the non-interface
residues Phe32Asp and Ala36Lys (Figure 1B). The GPG linker was changed to PGG in CNSP2 to
enhance the flexibility of the loop. A shorter constrained peptide, CSNP3, was constructed by
considering the pharmacophores of α1 helix to validate both the importance of Lys353 and selfsufficiency of α1 helix for RBD binding.
CSNP4 was designed under the consideration of the spontaneous position switching as well as
ACE2-RBD interface residues of the RBD. Two amino acid stretches of 445-456 and 488-501 which
participate in ACE2 binding, were truncated from the RBD and joined through flexible linker,
LIGRGP, to optimally orient the joining peptides and retain its target-binding ability. In its resting
(RBDdown) position, the same sheet-loop-sheet motif lays between the NTD and the RBD domains
of the adjustment S protomer, as we have shown previously (30). Thus, in addition to ACE2-RBD
hindrance, we suggest that CSNP4 can present RBD for the immune surveillance by limiting its
spontaneous position switching. The overall strategy for peptide designing is outlined in Figure
1C.

Structural-constrains stabilize the CSNPs
Structural stability and resistance to enzymatic degradation are important features in designing
small therapeutic peptides. Moreover, fold-on-binding requires time and often peptides lose
their target specificity if the structures are not intact (28); therefore, the structures of CSNP1-3
were stabilized by applying structural restrains, and the two amino acid stretches of the CSNP4
were joined through a shorter loop “LIGRGP”. To check their structural stability, these peptides
were simulated in an aqueous environment as a function of time. To validate the stability, we
also simulated SBP1, a previously reported structurally unrestrained ACE2-derived RBD-binding
peptide. Overall, there was a considerable root mean square deviation (RMSD) in all atoms of the
peptides in the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the simulation (Figure 2A). To track the fluctuation of RMSD
at atomic level, the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of all atoms of all five peptides were

calculated. The terminal atoms of all peptides, particularly CSNP4, exhibited considerable
fluctuation as compared to the atoms in peptide bodies. However, CSNP1 and SBP1 exhibited
high fluctuation in atoms ranging from 100-170, as compared to CSNP2 and CSNP3 (Figure 2B).
The radius if gyration (Rg), which predicts the folding with compactness of the peptides, showing
that SBP1 and CSNP3 undergoes a dramatic shift and exhibit a shrinkage in structure (Figure 2C).
This suggests that the hydrogen bonds between the sidechains of these peptides have probably
acquired a new pattern and perhaps disordered the peptides structure. To validate these data,
1000 structural frames were extracted from the 200 ns MD trajectory of each peptide and
inspected in their secondary structural alteration. The 3D motions and changes in their secondary
structure, as a function of time, were preserved in 3D animation (Figure 2D and Supplementary
movie 1). Remarkably, CSNP1 and SBP1 were shifted from helical to an irregular looped
structures, permanently losing their structural helicity; however, CSNP3 partly retained its helical
structure. Among the helical peptides CSNP2 held its structure intact; however, its C-terminal SS constrain region remained flexible at the PGG junction (Supplementary movie 1). These data
suggest that constrains stabilize peptide structures and could possibly retain their target binding
affinity.

Binding stability of CSNPs to RBD and ACE2
ACE2-derived CSNPs, docked onto RBD, were simulated in a neutralized solution state, whereas
CSNP4 was simulated with ACE2. The interface residues of the docked CSNPs were identified and
found overlapping with that of ACE2-RBD (Figure 3A, Supplementary tables 2, 3). We found that
all the target-bound forms of these peptides were relatively more stable compared to their
unbound isolated states (Figure 3B). However, CSNP3 exhibited an increased RMSD, which might
be due to the N-terminal hydrophilic Glutamic acid, causing detachment of the RBD during
simulation (Supplementary movie 2). SBP1 also affects the overall RMSD of RBD. Indeed, both
SBP1-bound RBD and CSNP3-bound RBD had similar tendency in their RMSD plots (Figure 3C). To
measure the dissociation of CSNPs from their targets, the average distances between the center
of their masses and intermolecular hydrogen bonds number were calculated as function of time
(Figure 3D, E). The average distance between CSNP1-, CSNP2-, and SBP1-RBD complexes remain

constant through the simulation course; however, the distances between CSNP3-RBD and
CSNP4-ACE2 remained unstable (Figure 3D). The distance between ACE2 and CSNP4 was ~35nm
at the start of simulation which increased to ~40nm at the midpoint (50ns) of MD run. This
increase in the distance could be due to the free N- and C-terminals of the CSNP4, which also had
a significant impact on the overall stability (RMSD) of the peptide as well as CSNP4-ACE2 complex
(Figure 3B, C). The distance between CSNP3 and RBD fluctuated due to the loosely bound
hydrophilic N-terminal Glutamic acid of the peptide, which also effect the adjacent Asparagine
and detach from RBD (Supplementary movie 2). This detachment compels the N-terminal of the
peptide on a whip-like motion; nonetheless, the C-terminal residues remained intact with RBD.
The binding strength between the peptides and their targets were estimated using Poisson–
Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. For all the five peptide-bound complexes, van der
Waals (vdW), Electrostatic (Ele), Polar Solvation (PS), and Solvent accessible surface area (SASA)
energies were calculated (Table 2). Based on the type and length of the peptides, we could
separate them into 3 groups; 1) CSNP1 and CSNP2 contain both the α1 helix and β3-β4 region
and binds to RBD; 2) CSNP3 and SBP1 are composed of α1 helix only and bind to RBD; 3) CSNP4
is totally different from the helical peptides and binds to ACE2 and RBD. The overall binding
affinities of CSNP1 (total E = -298.44 +/- 82.0 kcal/mol) and CSNP2 (total E = -283.77 +/- 81.3)
with RBD were relatively similar. However, the energies of vdW and Ele for CSNP2 were stronger
than those for CSNP1 (Table 2). Similarly, the total binding energy of CSNP3 helical peptide (total
E = -382.73 +/- 63.4 kcal/mol) with RBD was relatively stronger than that of SBP1 (total E = 356.73
+/- 75.1). The polar solvation energy of the SBP1-RBD (853.42 +/- 116.0 kcal/mol) was
considerably higher than that of CSNP3-RBD (532.67 +/- 190.2). This notion suggests that upon
exposure to solvent, the SBP1-RBD complex may dissociate faster as compared to CSNP3-RBD.

CSNPs interfere with the S1 binding to hACE2
Next, we synthesized the CSNPs to validate their functions as discussed in methods.
Unfortunately, we failed to synthesize CSNP1 and excluded in the following biophysical
experiments. The human ACE2 (hACE2) overexpressing cells were prepared by transfecting

HEK293 cells with hACE2-expressing plasmid, pcDNA3.1-hACE2 and treated with the peptides
(Figure 4A). We observed that S1 localized to the cell membrane in CSNP-untreated cells,
whereas CSNP2 and CSNP4 but not CSNP3 completely abolished the S1-ACE2 interaction (Figure
4B). Similar effect was observed when hACE2-HEK cells were treated at higher concentration
(25µM) of the peptides (Supplementary figure 2). This might be due to the shorter length of
CSNP3 which may not be able to optimally bind the RBD and hence fail to abrogate the S1-ACE2
interaction. To validate the S1 localization to the cell membrane and confirm the inhibitory effect
of the peptides further, we repeated the experiment in the β-catenin labeled hACE2-HEK cells.
As expected, CSNP2 and CSNP4 fully blocked the membrane localization of S1 (Figure 4C).

Biophysical interaction of the CSNPs with target proteins (SPR)
SPR is considered as a reproducible and sensitive technique (33) compared to Biolayer
interferometry (34) that can confirm the binding kinetics and biophysical interactions of CSNPs
with their targets. Nonetheless, the latter has been also used in the recent biophysical interaction
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike and multiple ligands including monoclonal antibodies, peptides, and
receptor proteins (35). As a validation step, the ACE2 and S1 subunits were immobilized to the
CM5 sensor chip as ligands and cross-tested as analytes. Although in nanomolar range, the
equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was slightly different in both cases. When S1 was
immobilized (as ligand) to the chip the KD was 3.66 nM; whereas, when ACE2 was used as ligand
and S1 as analyte the KD was 17.42 nM (Figure 5A).
CSNP2 and CSNP3 were injected as analytes onto the immobilized-S1 at six and seven different
concentrations, respectively. CSNP2, but not CSNP3, exhibited a dose-dependent binding to the
S1 protein with KD=31.8 µM (Figure 5B). This finding suggests that CSNP2, and probably CSNP1,
retains its binding to RBD. S1-ACE2 binding was relatively stronger (KD= 3-17 nM) compared to
the CSNP2-RBD binding. This may confirm that in addition to the α1 helix and Lys353, auxiliary
residues of the ACE2-RBD interface further enhance the binding (Figure 1A, Table1). Further
studies might be required, including the X-ray diffraction analysis of CSNP2-RBD that could pave

a way for the structural guided molecular modification CSNP2 to enhance its binding and
specificity to RBD.
Next, we measured the binding kinetics of CSNP4 and immobilized ACE2, revealing relatively
weak and dose-dependent binding-affinity between them (KD=158 µM) (Figure 5C). Considering
our immunocytochemistry results (Figure 4) and the fact that CSNP4 occupies the junction
between the NTD and RBDup of the adjacent S protomer in the trimeric Spike protein (Figure 5C),
we evaluated the binding affinity of CSNP4 with S1. Unexpectedly, we found that CSNP4 binds S1
as strong as CSNP2. The weak binding affinity of CSNP4-ACE2 can be explained for two reasons.
First, the α1 helix of ACE2 provides a narrow and shallow surface for the CSNP4 binding. Second,
Lys417, which contributes significantly to the ACE2-RBD binding (Table 1), is not included in
CSNP4. From this data, we suggest that designing an RBD-derived decoy peptide against ACE2
may not be sufficient to block ACE2-RBD interactions due to the large conformational space and
irregular loop structures of the ACE2-bindng motifs in RBD. The CSNP4-based S1 neutralization
could be attributed to the stronger CSNP4-S1 binding, which may limit the freedom of RBD and
ultimately deter it’s binding to ACE2.

Discussion
Hots cell entry is the first step in viral infection and remained a priority concern for the
therapeutic interventions. The impulsive conformation switching of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, as
reported by Wrapp et al. (15), is one of the immune evasion strategy utilized by CoVs (11, 13).
After understanding the receptor binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, we have tried to explain its
immune evasion mechanism through a stepwise illustration (Figure 6A). ACE2 is the principal
RBD-recognizing receptor, which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble form. ADAM17 (a
disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) (36) and TMPRSS2 (37) regulates the shedding of its
enzymatically active ectodomain into the blood circulation (Figure 6B). Watson et al. have
demonstrated that soluble ACE2 binds the RBD with comparatively similar binding affinity as do
its neutralizing antibodies (38). In fact, the soluble ACE2 serves as “double edge sword”; on one
hand it acts as a potent inhibitor of the pseudotyped lentivirus in vitro(39), on the other hand it

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424801; this version posted December 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

abrogates the RBD neutralization (Figure 6A). Due to its RBD-binding ability, soluble ACE2 has
been used to block viruses from entering cells (40). Collectively, RBD spontaneously switches
from ‘up’ to ‘down’ and that soluble ACE2 shields the spike protein from immune surveillance.
This paradox should be considered for the identification of therapeutic agents that abolish the
Spike-ACE2 interaction. Instead of alleviating certain symptoms, a world-wide affordable and
deployable strategy need to be implemented to design stable and frequently administrable
therapy that could offset the real cause of infection. Biologics that can interfere with RBD-ACE2
binding, facilitating the “up” conformation of RBD, and minimally interfere the antibody binding
and B cell response to the S protein are required. This strategy was partly utilized by the two FDA
approved RNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, that encode the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein in a stable prefusion conformation. In both vaccines the antigenic spike protein is
mutated by substituting the two consecutive lysine 986 and valine 987 at the top of central helix
in S2 domain into proline to convert the metastable prefusion conformation into a stable
prefusion state for continuous immune surveillance (1, 41, 42).
The binding spike with ACE2 and the subsequent conformational rearrangements of the S2 for
the viral-host membranes fusion make this entire process a prime target for the vaccines and
drug development. We and others have investigated that SARS-CoV-2 utilize shallow and
expanded surface contacts between spike and ACE2 for host cells entry (15, 18, 31, 35). These
hurdles i.e. the shallow, widely expanded, and flat contact surfaces, makes the spike-ACE2 a hard
target for widely utilized small organic molecules-based medicinal chemistry approaches. Even
though, tremendous progress has been made in targeting viral protease with small molecules
(43), disrupting spike-ACE2 interface with same strategies remained an uphill task. Alternatively,
small peptides, peptide-memetic, and mini-proteins have overcome this difficulty and we have
seen astonishing outcomes in blocking viral entry and neutralization (26, 44, 45). The deployment
of peptides-based biologics has expanded the concept of druggability by specifically and
effectively targeting PPI that are hard to target with organic molecules (46). Despite the
considerably high selectivity and lower toxicity, compared to small molecules, peptides
therapeutics are challenging due to their compromisable stability and subsequent low
bioavailability due to shortened half-lives in vitro and in vivo. Improved strategies including

peptides stapling, lipid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification, and peptide bundles have
been advised over the time to overcome these hurdles and formulated effective biologics against
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (26, 35, 47).
Similarly, CSNPs were designed to block the ACE2-RBD interaction, interfere with capping of
spike by soluble ACE2, and present spike proteins in its open form to host B-cell responses. The
helical peptides, CSNP1-3, were designed to be engaged in the binding of spike to ACE2. A number
of studies have reported redundant yet overlapping epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are
recognized by neutralizing antibodies (48-50). Among them, Ju et al. isolated 206 RBD-specific
monoclonal antibodies from 8 SARS-CoV-2 patients, which compete with ACE2 for RBD binding
(49). After structure superimposition of the P2B-2F6-RBD (isolated by Ju et al.) and CSNP1-RBD,
we could observe that CSNP1 was not able to make any stearic hindrance with P2B-2F6
(Supplementary Figure 1B). This suggests that CSNP2, which binds the same RBD-interface as
CSNP1, hinder the ACE2-RBD interaction (Figures 4 & 5) and allow RBD to be recognized by
neutralizing antibodies. However, this notion needs further confirmation through competitive
binding assays. Second, the immune-evasive position-switching of RBD as well as its ACE2 binding
require a strategy to restrict the freedom of RBD for robust immune response, at the same time
hinder its binding to ACE2. As a matter of fact, RBD itself could be used as double-edge sword in
this scenario. In its closed conformation (RBDdown), the ACE2-binding motifs of RBD occupy the
“V” shaped space between the NTD and RBD of the adjacent S protomer (Figure 5C, D).
Consequently, CSNP4 was designed and found to block the S1 binding to hACE2 (Figure 4B). We
believe that CSNP4 not only inhibits ACE2-RBD binding but can also compete with RBD hiding in
the “V” pocket.
The three dimensional conformational spacing of the pharmacophores in α-helix is crucial for
the helical CSNP1-3 peptides. Short peptides unfold and lose their secondary structures in
solution state when they were truncated from tertiary folded proteins. The structural stability of
the CSNPs investigated through MDS indicates that the unconstrained peptides very quickly loses
their helicity and acquire irregular looped conformation (Figure 2D, Supplementary movie S1).
This may be one of the reasons short peptides lose target specificity. To overcome this limitation,

two research groups have stabilized the α1 helix by increasing the helical bundles and designed
peptide biologics that could effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (44, 45). However, this
modification increases the size of these peptides by ~3-4 folds, increasing the cost of synthesis
and formulation. We and others have previously used peptide stapling to enhance the target
specificity of therapeutic peptides (28, 51). In fact, Fiarlie and his co-workers found that the
helical-constrained compounds hold comparatively similar biological potencies in PPI as their
parent proteins. They constructed four such compounds and proposed that downsizedconstrained peptides could be of great value in biological PPIs and medicine (52). Unfortunately,
we could not synthesize the CSNP1 to compare its potency with CSNP2; however, CSNP3 (a
relatively shorter version of CSNP1) was unable to bind SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Figure 5). This notion
suggests that in addition to the structural integrity, optimum length and the featured
pharmacophores are vital for CSNP to bind RBD. Together, we suggest that structure guided
computational medicinal chemistry and click chemistry approaches might be useful in designing
CSNPs to enhance tethering to their targets. Collectively, we suggest that CSNP2 and CSNP4 are
stable peptide that deter the binding of ACE2 and S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 and could be potent
antidote for COVID-19.

Methods
Peptides Designing Rationale and Synthesis
The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD bound to ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M0J) was used to
design the CSNP1-CSNP3 peptides. For CSNP4, both the trimeric spike-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6ZXN) and
ACE2-RBD complexes were considered. For CSNP1-3 the hotspot residues on both RBD and ACE2
were designated through PDBePISA (53) and their contribution into the interface were evaluated
through alanine scanning, using DrugscorePPI (54). This server utilizes the interface knowledge
and calculate the difference in binding energy of the wild type (ΔGWT) and mutant (ΔGMUT)
residues at the interface and provides hotspot information in terms of numerical values and the
corresponding 3D b-factor coordinates. Two regions on the ACE2, a.a. 23-46 and a.a. 352-357
that optimally engage the RBD, were selected for the parent peptides (CSNP1) design. Both

regions were linked through GPG loop and the freedom of K353 was restricted by disulfide bond
(S-S) bond, stapling the two beta sheets at position C350 and C356.
The electrostatic surface map, around the hotspot and other interface residues were created
using APBS and APBSrun plugins and potential modifiable and vital pharmacophores were
identified in the α1 helix (a.a. 23-46) using pharmacophore package in MOE (2019.0102). Taking
the surface complementarity into consideration, five potential residues, i.e. Glu23, Lys26, Thr27,
His34, and Gln42 were identified and subsequently substituted to enhance the CSNP1-RBD
binding using residues-scan tool in protein-design package of MOE suit. The detailed protocol has
been outlined previously (55). In first step, the mutation window was restricted to one residue
only, and the Glycine and self-mutation were excluded during mutant generation. Based on
binding affinity and stability, the top five mutants were selected and subjected to the second
round of residues scan, keeping the mutation window five. Based on binding Change in the
binding affinity of the wild type and mutant peptides were dually evaluated through SSIPe and
EvoEF (56). To stabilize and retain the helical structure of the selected peptides a lactam bridge
was created at i and i+4 position of the non-interface residues, as described in our previous work
(28). For CSNP3, the pharmacophores in the α1 (a.a. 21-46) region of ACE2 were considered but
the a.a. 352-357 regions were excluded. The CSNPs designing strategy has been outlined in figure
2C. Like CSNP1, CSNP4 was designed by linking a.a. 445-456 and a.a. 488-501 of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD and residues scan was not implemented. Three, CSNP2-4, of the final selected CSNPs peptide
were successfully synthesized by Peptron Inc. (Daejeon, Korea) at a purity of 99% (CSNP2), 95%
(CSNP3), and 96% (CSNP4) as determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu Prominence). Detailed protocol has been provided in our
previous study (28).

Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) analysis of CSNPs
MDS is widely used technique to study the protein folding and the dynamic behavior of
macromolecules in complex or isolated form. Briefly, default ABMER99-ILDN force-field (57) was
used for CSNP1, CSNP4, and SBP1 (a previously identified RBD-binding peptide) simulation, while

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424801; this version posted December 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the same force-field was modified for the lactam-stapled peptides, CSNP2 and CSNP3. New
residues and parameters were added into the modified force-field wherever needed. The
peptides in their isolated form were simulated for 200 ns and their target-bound complexes for
100 ns. All simulations were carried out in GROMACS 2019.6 in TIP3P water filled cubic box with
10 Å extended boundaries from the protein. All the systems were neutralized with counter ions,
Na+/Cl-, wherever needed and energy minimized under steepest descent algorithm, then
equilibrated with NVT ensemble for 0.2 ns and re-equilibrated with NPT ensemble for 0.2 ns,
under constant temperature and pressure, respectively. The temperature and pressure were
coupled with V-rescale and Parrinello-Rahman barostat methods (58), respectively. The bond
lengths were constrained with LINCS algorithm and long-range electrostatic interactions were
computed with particle mesh Ewald algorithm (59).
Binding free energy calculations using Molecular mechanics Poisson−Boltzmann surface area.
Molecular mechanics Poisson−Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) is used for calculating the
relative biding energy of ligands bound to target (60). We used the g_mmpbsa and APBSA tools
implemented in GROMACS for calculating energies. As g_mmpbsa tool is compatible with older
versions of GROMACS (versions 5 or lower), the “tpr” files created by GROMACS 2019.6 were
recreated through GROMACS 5.1 and used for binding energy calculation. The relative binding
energies of the complexes were approximated according to the following energies terms.
ΔGbind = ΔEMM + ΔGsol
whereas;
ΔEMM = ΔEcov + ΔEelec + ΔEvdW
and;
ΔGsol = ΔGpolar + ΔEnon-polar
ΔEMM is gas-phase MM-energy change and ΔGsol is the solvation free energy change. van der
Waals energy change (ΔEvdW), the electrostatic energy change (ΔEele), and the covalent energy
change (ΔEcov). The solvation free energy (ΔGsol) is computed by combining both polar and non-

polar energies. All these changes were computed via ensemble which is averaged over a set of
conformations sampled over the last 25 ns simulation trajectory at 0.01 ns time interval.

Computational tools used in this study
For simple visualization and collecting structural insights of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2
proteins, free available packages of VMD (61), Pymol (https://pymol.org), and Chimera (62) were
utilized. For electrostatic surfaces isolation of the proteins, APBS and APBSrun plugins in Pymol
and VMD, and for monitoring changes in the secondary structures of the peptides as function of
time the sscache.tcl script was used in VMD. For 3D animated movies creation VMD was used.
For the interface analysis and determining the contribution of each residue into the ACE2-S
binding, online server PDBePISA (v1.52)(53) and free available BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer
were used. After using the PPCheck hotspot prediction tool, the alanine scanning package in
same sever was used for the aniline mutagenesis (63). The hotspot results were validated through
DrugScorePPI web server and the results were recorded in terms of energies (54, 64). For
pharmacophore evaluation ligandScout trial version and MOE were used (65). However, as our
interest lays in amino acid determinants isolation, we did not use the pharmacophore model for
drug screening. For molecular dynamics simulations GROMACS 2019.6 was used (66). For MMPBSA calculations, the “tpr” files created by GROMACS 2019.6 were recreated through GROMACS
5.1 and used for binding energies calculations, as described previously (64).

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis
For the physical interaction of CSNPs with ACE2 and S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2, SPR assay was
conducted, using Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare, Sweden) technique. S1 (ligand, AcroBiosystems,
S1N-C52H3-100UG, USA) protein was immobilized to the CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare, Cat#.
BR-1005-30) at 6.0 μg/mL concentration using 10mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) as immobilization
buffer. ACE2 (Acrobiosystems, AC2-C52H7-50ug, USA) was immobilized to the same chip at 6.2
μg/mL concentration using 10mM sodium acetate immobilization buffer. The following solutions
were used as running buffers: 1) HBS (10mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl), 2) HBS-EP (10mM
HEPES, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.05% P20), 3) HBS with 5% DMSO. NaOH solution (10

~ 50) mM was used as regeneration buffer. The CSNPs were injected into the ligand-bound chip
at different concentrations and their respective ka, kd, and KD values were calculated. The running
buﬀer was injected into the empty channel as a reference. The experiments were conducted in
duplicate with freshly prepared reagents, and the data were analyzed in the Software Control
(version 2.0.1), and BIAevaluation (version 3.0) software.

Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy analyses
HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank
(KCLB, Chongno, Seoul, Korea) and cultured on growth media consisting of Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) and 1%
antibiotics (Gibco, USA) in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. For Immunocytochemistry analysis,
HEK293 cells were transfected with 3.0ug pcDNA3.1-hACE2 (Addgene, 145033, USA) plasmids by
Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, L3000015, USA). The relative hACE2 quantity was evaluated
through mRNA expression level using following primers: (Cosmo genetech, hACE2-F: 5’-TCC ATT
GGT CTT CTG TCA CCC G-3’, hACE2-R: 5’-AGA CCA TCC ACC TCC ACT TCT C-3’, Republic of Korea).
For CSNPs-binding, hACE2-overexpressed Hek293 cells were incubated with 10 uM peptide for 1
hour and then treated and incubated with 5 uM SARS-CoV-1 S1 protein-His Tag (AcroBiosystems,
S1N-C52H3-100UG, USA) for 24 hours. After the cells were washed three times with PBS,
incubated with serum free media with primary antibody anti-ACE2 (1:100, Cell signaling, 4355S,
USA), anti-CTNNB1 (1:100, Cell signaling, 8480S, USA) and anti-His-Tag (1:100, Santa cruz, sc8036, USA) at 4°C for 2 hours. Cells were then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and
incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200, Thermo, A21203,
USA) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, Thermo, A21206, USA) at room
temperature for 2 hours. Before the secondary antibodies incubated, cells blocking with blocking
solution (1% PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 hour. All
secondary antibodies were diluted in an appropriate concentration of blocking solution. Nuclei
were stained with DAPI containing mounting solution (Vector, H-1200, USA). The cells were then
visualized on a LSM710 (Carl Zeiss) confocal microscope.

Figures and legends
Figure 1: The SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-hACE2 interface analyses and CSNPs peptides designing
rationale. A) Identification of the crucial residues at the ACE2-RBD interface using interactive
structures and surfaces strategy. The smooth surfaces (blue, +ve; red, -ve; white, neutral) are
drawn over the RBD residues while the meshes represents the electrostatic surface around the
interface residues of ACE2. B) The sequence and secondary structure representation of the
designed CSNPs. C) The overall protocol of CSNPs design. The interface residues were identified,
vetted for their energy contribution at the interface (Supplementary figure 1), and featured for
pharmacophores or non-pharmacophores. The potential residues were substituted to augment
the ACE2-RBD binding.
Figure 2: Structural validation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) using
molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). A) Root mean square deviation (RMSD) plots of all
atoms in CSNPs and SBP1 with respect to their initial conformation are presented. The color cods
are shown on the top-right and are same of all three (A, B, C) plots. B) The root mean square
fluctuation (RMSF) plots of the peptides at atomics level. C) The radios of gyration of the peptides
as a function of time. D) The representative 3D structures of the CSNPs and SBP1 peptides
showing a significant shift in their structure, as they evolve during simulation. The structural
coordinates were taken from the first and last nanosecond of the MDS trajectory. The purple
color represents helicity, cyan represent loop and yellow color corresponds to beta sheets. CSNP1
and CSNP3 undergone through a drastic shift in structure. The real-time change in the secondary
structures are shown in supplementary movie S1.
Figure 3: The binding and structural dynamics of CSNPs with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and hACE2
as determined through molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). A) The initial poses of the helical
peptides bound to RBD are shown here. These complexes were used for molecular dynamics
simulation. The exact dynamic motions of all complexes during simulation are preserved in
supplementary movie S2. B) All atoms deviation from their initial position were determined for
the peptides through RMSD as a function of time. Peptides acquire a stable dynamics behavior

upon binding with their targets, as compared to their isolated solution states (Figure 3A). Overall,
there is a gradual rise in the RMSD of CSNP3 and CSNP4. C) Among the helical peptides, CSNP1-3
and SBP1, CSNP3 and SBP1 effect the overall stability of the RBD. Although stable, their RMSD
plots were distinct from other complexes. CSNP3-RBD in particular exhibit a gradual rise in the
RMSD, similar to that of isolated peptide. D) The average distances between the center of masses
of the peptides and their target proteins. The distances of CSNP3-RBD and CSNP4-ACE2 were not
constant as a function of time. E) The number of hydrogen bonds established by the peptides
with their target proteins as a function of time. The highest number of hydrogen bonds were
established and maintained by CSNP2 and RBD. The color cods are same for all plots and given in
panel B.
Figure 4: CSNPs peptides deter the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and hACE2 interaction in hACE2overexpressing HEK293 cells. A) The over expression of hACE2 in HEK293 cells as determined
through the relative ACE2 mRNA level. B) CSNP2 and CSNP4 block the binding of S1 to hACE2
(labeled green) expressing cells. C) The membrane localization of hACE2 and the S1 binding to
the hACE2 was indirectly confirmed through β-catenin (a protein localizes to adherens junctions)
labeling. CSNP2 and CSNP4 clearly deter the membrane binding of S1 protein.
Figure 5: The binding kinetics of the hACE2, SARS-CoV-2 S1, and CSNP peptides. A) The binding
affinities of hACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S1 domains and vice versa, were determined by immobilizing
both proteins to the chip in separate channels and also used as analytes for injection in different
concentrations. The sensorgrams showing 1:1 binding are shown for both proteins and their rates
of association (ka), dissociation (kd) and equilibrium constants of dissociation KD are given in the
tables below each panel. B) Helical peptide CSNP2 binds the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein dosedependently, but CSNP3 could not show any binding at the given concentrations. C, D) CSNP4
exhibit binding to both hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S1 dose-dependently. Nonetheless, the CSNP4-S1
binding affinity was ~13 times higher than that of CSNP4-hACE2. The KD values are given in the
tables below each panels and the targets-binding mechanism of CSNP4 are depicted in the
cartoon representation.

Figure 6: The ACE2-binding and shedding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit.
A) The receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit of the spike protein binds the membranebound ACE2 (ACE2M). The cell surface expressed and lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin,
furin, and TMPRSS2 cleaves the ACE2M-bound spike at the S1-S2 cleavage motif. S2 subunits then
facilitate the viral and host membrane fusion while S1 subunits are shed extracellularly. These
stranded S1 subunits are immunogenic and crucial for host antiviral humoral immune response.
The released S1 subunits could be masked by the overexpressed soluble ACE2S protein in diabetic
and cardiac patients, causing poor viral neutralization and comparatively high mortality. B) The
soluble ACE2 (ACE2S) or its mimics could neutralize and deter the binding of spike to membranebound ACE2. This could cause a paradoxical condition of low viral infectivity yet low viral
neutralization by host antibody response.
