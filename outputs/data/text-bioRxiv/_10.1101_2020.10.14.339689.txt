Abstract
The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in 1,092,342 deaths as of 14th October 2020, indicating the
urgent need for a vaccine. This study highlights novel protein sequences generated by shot gun
sequencing protocols that could serve as potential antigens in the development of novel subunit
vaccines and through a stringent inclusion criterion, we characterized these protein sequences and
predicted their 3D structures. We found distinctly antigenic sequences from the SARS-CoV-2
that have led to identification of 4 proteins that demonstrate an advantageous binding with Human
leukocyte antigen-1 molecules. Results show how previously unexplored proteins may serve as
better candidates for subunit vaccine development due to their high stability and
immunogenicity, reinforce by their HLA-1 binding propensities and low global binding energies.
This study thus takes a unique approach towards furthering the development of vaccines by
employing multiple consensus strategies involved in immuno-informatics technique.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are rather common throughout the
community, causing illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS-CoV) (1). The previous outbreaks of these coronaviruses in 2003 and 2015
respectively show similarities to the novel coronavirus (2), which was first reported in December
2019 in Wuhan (3). It was later declared as a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 by the World
Health Organization (WHO) having caused a global emergency across many countries and
territories around the world.
The causative agent of the COVID-19 disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was initially tagged as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) by the World Health Organization (4) before genomic studies revealed a 79.5% and 96%
nucleotide level similarity with SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus respectively (5,6), hence
necessitating its new identity. Further analysis on its similarity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
including phylogeny revealed that it is categorized under the family Coronaviridae, order
Nidoviralae and genus Betacoronavirus alongside the other two viruses which have also caused
pandemic situations in the past, causing thousands of death globally. (7,8)
The structural architecture of SARS-CoV-2 is an elaborate one, containing a positive
single stranded RNA as its genetic element with genomic length of about 29-30 kilobases, (9)
which encodes the major structural proteins being the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M)
protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. (10,11) The structure of the spike
glycoprotein of the virus is also an extended similarity with SARS-CoV, (4) which together with
COVID19: Exploring uncommon epitopes for a stable immune response through MHC1 binding

other proteins of the virus are candidates for vaccine development and are being explored in
different settings due to the active roles of the proteins in the infectivity of the virus. (12-15)
Developing an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is a research priority. Currently, different

therapeutic strategies are being utilized by researchers to combat this dangerous COVID-19, with
much of the focus being on developing novel drugs or vaccines. However, in recent years, the
development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse vaccinology (RV), which
aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen
genome. One of the successes of this method is the Bexsero vaccine, discovered for Group B
meningococcus. (16) This immuno-informatics method includes the identification of peptide
epitopes in the virus genome which can then be prepared by chemical synthesis techniques. These
epitopes are easier in quality control; however, there is the need for structural modifications as
well as the inclusion of delivery systems, and adjuvants in their formulation due to the low
immunogenicity of the epitopes which is a result of their structural complexity and low molecular
weight. (17)
Recently, a set of B and T cell epitopes highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 were
identified from the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV. (18) However studies have shown that full
length spike protein vaccines for SARS-CoV may lead to antibody mediated disease
enhancement causing inflammatory and liver damage in animal models (19,20) which is why in
this manuscript, we applied immuno-informatics “in silico” approaches to identify potential
CD8+ cytotoxic T Cell epitopes from proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In
achieving this, the ~29.8kb genome of the SARS-CoV-2 which encodes for 28 proteins
comprising 5 structural proteins, 8 accessory proteins and 15 non-structural proteins as well as
the ~30kb genome of SARS-CoV-1 comprising 14 open reading frames (ORF) were explored for
some uncommon proteins of the viruses with therapeutic potentials. Identified proteins were thus
considered for highly antigenic epitope prediction and evaluation. The antigenicity and
immunogenicity of all identified epitopes was estimated and their interactions with the human

leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I system were evaluated, owing to the wide usage of the HLA
system as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune
disorders, (21) as was explored in the case of SARS-CoV-1 after the first epidemic that broke
out in East Asia in 2002−2003. This is linked to the fact that HLA genes are known to display the
highest level of diversity in the genome, with thousands of different alleles now reported. Each of
these alleles is also a combination of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This, we
also investigated the HLA-class I system for evidence of disease association, with the hope that
the discovery of disease susceptibility will help in developing protection such as vaccines against
the virus.
Methods

Protein sequence retrieval:
The UniProt (22) database was searched for the protein sequences inferred from the
genome sequence analysis of different isolates of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. The
SARS CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 proteins without experimentally defined 3D structure
or functional annotation were chosen for further analysis and their sequence files in the FASTA
format were downloaded.
Sequence analysis and physicochemical parameters evaluation:
The FASTA sequences were used to infer the physicochemical properties of the chosen
uncharacterized viral proteins. With tools and servers including ExPASyProtParam, (23)
EMBOSS Pepstats (24), Peptide 2.0, (25) PROTEIN CALCULATOR v3.4, (26) important
physicochemical properties of the proteins including the sequence length and molecular weight,
theoretical isoelectric point (IpH), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and polarity indices (calculated
as the percentage of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and polar amino acids respectively), the content of

the basic amino acids (arginine, histidine, lysine), and disulfide bond allowing cysteine were
evaluated and computed. No less than three online tools were used to calculate each
parameter; the consensus results were chosen for presentation in this paper.
Tertiary structure modeling:
The 3D structures of the retrieved viral proteins were obtained using different
homology modeling tools of which at least four are approved by CASP. (27) Homology 3D
protein modeling against the protein templates with experimentally defined tertiary structure was
done using the following online servers: SWISS-MODEL, (28) LOMETS, (29) IntFold, (30) ITASSER, (31) FALCON, (32) GalaxyWeb. (33) The other tools used utilize different approaches:
RaptorX (34) exploits distance-based protein folding powered by deep learning; QUARK (35)
implements ab initio protein folding based on building from small fragments by replica-exchange
Monte Carlo simulation under the guide of an atomic-level knowledge-based force field.
Application of different algorithms lying behind each modeling tool provided various variants of
3D structure models for each protein. Up to five top models of each protein resulting from every
tool were selected for further processing.
Refinement and validation of tertiary structure:
Each model was refined using a molecular dynamics simulation approach implemented by
GALAXY Refine (36) tool or rapid energy minimization using discrete molecular dynamics
with an all-atom representation for each residue implemented by Chiron server. (37) The top
refined model was chosen for every protein based on the refinement servers output model
quality indices. The further Ramachandran analysis with PROCHECK (38) and Saves v5.0
tools Verify3D, (39) ERRAT, (40) and PROVE (41) was performed on the top models of all
proteins initially included in the analysis. Thermodynamic stability of the molecules was

predicted using SCooP analysis. (42) GROMOS96 (43) force field calculations were applied to
identify the most stable protein structures. Eight (8) protein models with the most geometrically
and thermodynamically stable structures that most likely represent the native 3D structures of
coronavirus proteins were finally selected.
Antigenicity prediction:
Antigenicity prediction of the top eight uncharacterized coronavirus proteins selected after
3D molecular models’ validation was performed using VaxiJen tool. (44) A threshold value of 0.4
was taken into account. Non-antigenic peptides having VaxiJen scores less than 0.4
were discarded, while antigenic epitopes with scores higher than 0.4 were further prioritized for
their immunogenicity. The proteins predicted to be non-antigens were discarded from the
further analysis.
T Cell Epitope Prediction and binding MHC class I alleles:
Antiviral immunity relies on the ability of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I molecules to bind antigen molecules and display them to T cells. In humans, MHC class I
is represented by human leukocyte antigens HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C that are
very polymorphic among human populations. The most common for African and Asian
populations HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C subtypes were retrieved from Allele Frequency Net
Database. (45) NetMHCpan 4.1 server (46) which applies artificial neural networks (ANNs)
trained on a combination of more than 850,000 quantitative Binding Affinity (BA) and MassSpectrometry Eluted Ligands (EL) peptides to predict the binding of peptides to any MHC
molecule of known sequence was used to predict strong binding epitope sequences from these
top 10 models. The strong binding epitope sequences predicted from the NETMHCpan server
were then analyzed for their antigenicity using Vaxijen (45) (threshold = 0.4). Further analysis

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.339689; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

including immunogenicity, allergenicity and toxicity of the peptide epitopes were done using
IEDB Immunogenicity analysis resource (Class I Immunogenicity), (47) AllerTOP v. 2.0 (48) and
ToxinPred (49) servers respectively. Peptide epitopes with the most immunogenic sequences
which were non allergens and nontoxic were used for molecular docking simulations with specific
HLA-1 alleles.

Molecular docking between MHC class I and predicted peptide epitopes 3D structures: The
3D structures for the most immunogenic sequences were generated using PEPFOLD3 server (50)
which applies a de novo approach based on a new Hidden Markov Model sub-optimal
conformation sampling to predict models for peptides from 5 to 50 amino acids. HLA structures
based on the binding predictions from NETMHCpan were downloaded from RCSB PDB and
isolated from their complexes using Chimera. (51) Molecular docking of these molecules was
carried out by PatchDock (52) which employs a surface patch matching algorithm inspired by
object recognition and image segmentation techniques to dock the molecules. The top 1000
results from PatchDock were then submitted to FireDock (53) for refinement of protein-protein
docking solutions. Given a set of up to 1000 potential docking candidates, FireDock refines and
scores them according to an energy function, spending about 3.5 seconds per candidate solution.
Each candidate is subsequently refined by restricted interface side-chain rearrangement and by
soft rigid-body optimization. The side-chain flexibility is modeled by rotamers and the obtained
combinatorial optimization problem is solved by integer linear programming. Following
rearrangement of the side-chains, the relative position of the docking partners is refined by Monte
Carlo minimization of the binding score function. The refined candidates are ranked by the
binding score which is a combination of Atomic Contact Energy, softened Van der Waals
interactions, partial electrostatics and additional estimations of the binding free energy.

Conservancy Analysis:
In order to identify functionally important regions in the selected proteins and
the selection of epitopes with the desired degree of conservation, Consurf (54) was used to
determine the variability of epitopes within the selected proteins. The degree of conservation at
each amino acid site is similar to the inverse of the site's rate of evolution; slowly evolving sites
are evolutionarily conserved while fast evolving sites are variable. (55) Amino acid residues that
are crucial for retention of protein function are believed to be associatedwith inherently
lower variability, even under immune pressure and as such often represent good targets for
the development of epitope-based vaccines. (56) Both 3D structure and FASTA sequences of
the proteins were used as inputs and the Consurf server carries out both a PSI-BLAST search
for close homologues and a multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL W. The server
thus builds a phylogenetic tree that is consistent with the MSA and then calculates the
conservation grades which are color-coded, taking into account the evolutionary relationship
between the homologues.

RESULTS

Human Coronavirus uncharacterized protein sequences analysis:
A total of 8 non-structural sequences were identified and retrieved from
UniProtKB database. The mass, isoelectric-pH, Basic amino acid %, Cysteine %, Polarity
and Hydrophobicity of the protein sequences were computed and outlined in table 1. The lengths
of these protein sequences varied from 39 to 275 amino acid residues. Cysteine was found to
have the highest presence in the selected proteins with an average of 5.56% and its highest
presence was observed in proteinQ7TFA0 with 15.40%. Arginine, Lysine and Histidine have an
average presence of 2.35%, 3.69% and 4.36% respectively. The polarity and non polarity of the

final selected proteins ranged from 27.907%to 63.839 % and from 36.161%to 72.093%
respectively with M4SVF1 having the highest percentage of polar amino acids (63.839%) while
P0DTD8 has the highest percentage of non-polar amino acids (72.093%). Likewise, the
highest hydrophobicity index was recorded for P0DTD8.
Protein 3D Structure Predictions:
After obtaining the 3D structures of the proteins from modeling servers, the models
were refined using GalaxyRefine. Upon refinement, the models were subjected to stereochemical
and thermodynamic stability analysis. Particularly, the models with highest Ramachandran
favored residues and lowest clash scores were used for energy analysis using Chiron, SCooP and
ERRAT servers as highlighted in table 2. All the protein structures had a Ramachandran score of
over 89% and an ERRAT value of over 60, with Q7TFA0, P0DTD8 and P0DTD3 all having a
perfect 100% Ramachandran scores. The free energy of the structures ranged from 28.7kcal/mol (Q7TFA0) to -2.2 kcal/mol (A0A6H2LBE3). Force field values ranging from 5955.989 (A0A6H2LBE3) to -435.783 (P0DTD8) were observed using GROMOS96
implementation of the Swiss-PDB Viewer. The models with lowest overall energies were
determined to be stable.

Viral Protein Antigenicity Predictions:
VaxiJen Antigenicity prediction was used to predict the overall antigenicity of the
8 proteins as outlined in table 3. Two proteins: M4SVF1_MERS and Q7TFA0 were predicted to
be non-antigens with their antigenicity scores of 0.3373 and 0.1251 respectively while P0DTD8
and P0DTC8 showed very high antigenicity owing to their high scores of 0.8462 and 0.6502
respectively.
Human Leukocyte Antigen Interactions:

T-cell epitope prediction was carried out using IEDB, EpiJen, PepVac, Rankpep,
and NetMHC. Initially, 15,181 HLA class I binding epitopes were predicted from 6 out of 8 stable
proteins which were predicted to be antigenic. Scrutiny on the basis of percentile rank filtered 112
peptide epitopes. Considerable binding affinity for 5 HLA-1 subtypes with high frequencies in
Asia and Africa (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*27:05 and HLA
B*58:01) was observed from NETMHCpan server which predicted high affinity binders
(<0.5 percentile rank) using EL-Ranks. Among predicted epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 virus, ten (10)
epitopes showed considerably high immunogenicity towards the MHC-Class 1 molecules
which were then selected for further analysis (Table 4). All the predicted epitopes were
further subjected to allergenic and toxicity analysis, with all 10 coming out as non-allergens and
non toxins (Table 4). Epitopes including HLVDFQVTI, RKSAPLIEL, and YLCFLAFLL showed
remarkably high antigenic tendencies, scoring 1.4119, 1.1591 and 0.9143 respectively. All
of these epitopes, along with their features are reported in Table 4. The structures of HLA1 Subtypes namely, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*27:05 and HLAB*58:01 were obtained from RCSB PDB (Table 5). Further docking analysis resulted in a total of
10 global binding energies predictions which were refined with FireDock (Table 6). The global
binding energies range from -68.71 to -11.19 indicating that all the proposed epitope sites from
the modelled proteins can serve as good antigens.
Conservation Analysis of the Selected T-cell epitopes
The conservation status of each residue in the selected T-cell epitopes in four (4) SARS
COV-2 proteins (Q7TLC7, P0DTC6, P0DTD8, P0DTC8) were examined using ConSurf.
Results revealed that the highly conserved and exposed residues are found in all 4 proteins, with
P0TDC6 and P0DTC8 having the larger amount of these residues. Particularly, the epitopes
without allergenicity and toxicity containing at least one predicted functional residue (highly

conserved and exposed) included epitopes 'RKSAPLIEL' and 'HLVDFQVTI' while T-cell
epitopes 'RKSAPLIEL', 'FLAFLLFLV’, and 'HLVDFQVTI' contained at least one predicted
structural residue (highly conserved and buried). Interestingly, none of the epitopes
from P0DTD8 contained any functional residues (highly conserved and exposed) while the
highest concentration of predicted structural and functional residues was found in two epitopes
HLVDFQVTI (1 functional residue and 3 structural residues) and RKSAPLIEL (3
functional residues and 1 structural residue)- from the protein P0DTC6 .
Discussion
Despite the continuous unrest caused by the COVID19 pandemic, considering the 1,886,643 new
cases recorded as of 7th September, 2020 which has spiked up the total reported cases to over
26.7 million and a total of 876,616 deaths globally, there is currently no available FDA-approved
vaccine against COVID-19 (57). If a vaccine is successfully developed against COVID-19, this
will improve global human health. Advancement in Technology has led to various Bioinformatic
approaches such as Reverse Vaccinonology (RV) and immune-informatics being applied to
revolutionize vaccine production in terms of production cost and time which has been a major
setback in vaccine development. Antibody response as well as cell mediated immunity can be
established by using proper protein antigen. Reverse vaccinology (RV) has been useful in
identification of potential vaccine candidates against pathogens and the world is in a race to get
one against SARS-COV2. This approach presents an advantage over other vaccine approaches
because it can identify all potential antigens coded by a genome irrespective of their abundance,
phase of expression and Immunogenecity.
While most of the previous protein vaccines against SARS-CoV have focused on the full
length spike protein of the virus, the vaccine development race against the COVID19 virus have

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.339689; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

followed the same path, with a larger percentage of the 69 of the 210 vaccines currently in
development utilizing the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 (58) not minding the reported
negative side effects, including liver damage and antibody mediated inflammatory diseases, of
the full length spike protein vaccines and other whole organism vaccines in the host.
Additionally, while novel technologies and approaches such as Next-generation vaccines enabled
through advances in nanotechnology which relies on the principle that nanoparticles and viruses
operate at the same length scale are poised to make a clinical impact for the first time, many of
these platforms may be several years away from deployment and therefore may not have an
impact on the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, further necessitating the priority given to the
quicker and safer vaccine development platforms. The current study focused on the HLA-1
binding propensities of some uncommon proteins from COVID-19 virus. Obtaining these
antigenic epitopes using the immune-informatics approach will help inform which epitopes to use
in the construct of protein vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 using proteins other than the spike
protein. From the 8 selected proteins obtained all the models with good stability analysis
including the Ramachandran analysis, which is a two dimensional plot drawn in the space of
angles ϕ and ψ that quantify the rotation of the protein backbone and thus play a crucial role in
the secondary structure of proteins and later the tertiary structure, were further analyzed for
antigenicity and only highly antigenic proteins were selected for further analysis since the highly
antigenic proteins will induce better immune response in the host.
Five (5) of the 35 most common HLA-1 subtypes in Africa and Asia that were identified
in this study were included in the analyses and their potential interactions between identified
epitopes from the proteins were predicted using the NetMHCpan 4.1 server. The binding
affinities between these HLA subtypes and the epitopes were indicated by the server which

allowed the selection of epitopes that will have strong interactions with the HLA alleles. The
analysis of this interaction is important because vaccination is a proven strategy for protection
from disease and an ideal vaccine would include antigens that elicit a safe and effective protective
immune response. HLA-restricted epitope vaccines, including T-lymphocyte epitopes restricted
by HLA alleles, embodies a newly developing and favorable immunization approach. Research in
HLA restricted epitope vaccines to be used for the treatment of tumors as well as for the
prevention of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections have, in recent years, achieved substantial
progress and this further strengthens the resolve of the HLA-binding propensities analysis done in
this study. The predicted strongest binding epitopes were thus further subjected to
immunogencity evaluation which checked the ability of the epitope to induce an immune response
and also predicted how strongly they will induce an immune response; Allergenicity which
verified the potential of our epitopes to cause sensitization or allergic reactions related to IgE
antibody responses; and Toxicity which is its ability to cause bodily harm. Using these criteria,
10 epitopes were identified and these could be potential epitopes for vaccine constructs
against SARS-CoV-2. This was also evinced by the lower global binding energies between our
identified epitopes and the HLA molecules, ranging from -68.71 to -11.19, indicating stable
complexes formed between them.
Conclusion
Our extensive approach towards the prediction of stable protein structures from previously
uncharacterized proteins and the subsequent application of immune-informatics for the
identification of immunogens has resulted in the classification of 10 different epitope sites from 8
different proteins that have high antigenicity and low binding energies with HLA-1 alleles that

are most commonly present in the continent of Asia and Africa. These epitopes have high
tendencies to provide effective and strong protective cytotoxic immunity against the SARS
CoV-2 if they are adequately exploited for vaccine production. A multiple consensus
approach ensures the reliability and reproducibility of these results. This study thus provides
further knowledge on the association of these HLA-1 alleles with COVID19, suggesting that
good peptide coverage can be achieved by many different combinations of HLA-1 alleles.
