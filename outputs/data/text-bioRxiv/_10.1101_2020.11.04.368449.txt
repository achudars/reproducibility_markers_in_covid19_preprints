Abstract
Background: DNA mismatches can affect the efficiency of PCR techniques if the intended target has mismatches in primers or
probes regions. The accepted rule is that mismatches are detrimental as they reduce the hybridization temperatures, yet a more
quantitative assessment is rarely performed.
Methods: We calculate the hybridization temperatures of primer/probe sets after aligning to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-1 and
non-SARS genomes, considering all possible combinations of single, double and triple consecutive mismatches. We consider the
mismatched hybridization temperature within a range of 5 ◦ C to the fully matched reference temperature.
Results: We obtained the alignments of 19 PCR primers sets that were recently reported for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to
21665 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as 323 genomes of other viruses of the coronavirus family of which 10 are SARS-CoV-1. We
find that many incompletely aligned primers become fully aligned to most of the SARS-CoV-2 when mismatches are considered.
However, we also found that many cross-align to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes.
Conclusions: Some primer/probe sets only align substantially to most SARS-CoV-2 genomes if mismatches are taken into account.
Unfortunately, by the same mechanism, almost 75% of these sets also align to some SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS viruses. It
is therefore recommended to consider mismatch hybridization for the design of primers whenever possible, especially to avoid
undesired cross-reactivity.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
caused a flurry of activity regarding the detection of SARSCoV-2, in particular a substantial amount of new RT-PCR
primers were developed for this specific purpose [1–19]. A
number of factors can influence the reliability of the PCR detection, such as sample contamination [20], cross-reactivity with
other viruses [14], contamination of reagents [21], non-specific
annealing [22] and poor amplification efficiency [23]. A crucial primer design factor is its hybridization melting temperature [24] that is related to the annealing of oligonucleotides. A
set of primers with close melting temperatures and in the ideal
range for primer extension usually ensures good PCR performance [25].
A factor that may interfere with the hybridization temperatures are the presence of mismatches, that is non-Watson-Crick
base pairs, between the primer and the DNA target. This affects the stability of the duplex, usually leading to a decrease
in the hybridization temperature [26, 27]. As a result, the presence of mismatches may influence the performance of primers
restraining the amplification of DNA target. New mismatches
arise due to mutations in primer regions of the target DNA,

and may lead to false-negative results [20, 28–30]. This is of
special concern for the case of RNA viruses that have a high
mutation rates [19, 30]. Mutations that occur in the SARSCoV-2 genome [31, 32] imply that the presence of mismatches
between primer/probe and the template eventually become inevitable. On the other hand, it is known that mismatch presence
may affect only the first few cycles of PCR [33, 34] and with
proper design may even be advantageous [35]. Therefore, as a
rule of thumb, the occurrence of single mismatches are admitted
in the hope that they may not affect the detection of the target
and its amplification [36]. Unfortunately, the thermodynamic
instability caused by the presence of mismatches is rarely quantified in primer design for a number of reasons. One of which is
that the prediction of hybridization temperatures involving mismatches carries large uncertainties. Unlike Watson-Crick complementary base pairs, AT and CG, the hydrogen bonding and
stacking interactions of mismatches are strongly dependent on
the adjacent base pairs. Temperature predictions rely on experimental melting temperature data which typically do not cover
the full combinatorial spectrum of mismatches and were carried
out under high sodium buffer conditions [37, 38]. However, this
has now changed. A recent development from our group has
reworked the parametrization for a comprehensive set of 4032
sequences containing up to three consecutive mismatches [39].
This now enables the analysis in unprecedented detail of the
effect of mismatches in primer/probe hybridization.

Here, we analyse how and if mismatches do influence the
melting temperatures of primer/probes hybridised to SARSCoV-2 genomes. We collected 19 PCR primer/probe sets (297
primers and 43 probes) which cover seven different gene regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome (N, E, S, M, ORF1ab, RdRp and
nsp2 genes) [1–19]. These primer/probes were aligned to 21665
genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and 323 genomes of other coronaviruses. Melting temperatures are calculated with a mesoscopic model using the newly developed parameters for up
to three consecutive mismatches [39]. Using the mesoscopic
model for the calculation of mismatches has an important advantage over nearest-neighbour models [37] as it naturally accounts for end effects, that is, mismatches located near the
primer end may have different hybridization temperatures than
those that are centred which reflects experimental observations
on PCR efficiencies [34].

A primer/probe that was completely aligned to a target
genome, without mismatches, was termed as strictly matched.
If there were up to three contiguous mismatches in the alignment it was called as partially matched. The limit of three contiguous mismatches relates to the available melting temperature parameters. Alignments with four or more contiguous mismatches were considered as not aligned.
As an example of partial alignment, we show the
RdRp SARSr-R1 primer (bottom strand) in the MT457390
genome

30 −ATACGATTATCACACAAATTGTAAAC−50
where the mismatched site is underlined.

where τ is a statistical index calculated from the classical partition function of a model Hamiltonian, and a0 and a1 are regression coefficients obtained from a set of 4096 experimental melting temperatures of which 4032 are from sequences containing
up to three consecutive mismatched base pairs [39]. The buffer
conditions for these parameters are 50 mM sodium chloride,
10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, and total strand concentration 1.0 µM. For a complete description of the melting temperature calculation and experimental conditions see Ref. [39, 42].
The index τ was calculated for each primer/probe, using the parameters reported in Ref. [39], after aligning against a reference
genome. The calculation of τ also yields the average displacement profile which shows the expected base-pair opening along
the oligonucletide duplex, for details see Eq.(5) from Ref. 39.

We collected NG = 21665 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 at
NCBI [40], in 8 October 2020, and ensured that all were at
least 25000 bp in size. The accession codes of these genomes
are shown in supplementary table S1. To verify cross-reactivity
we also performed the same analysis for Nh.c. = 323 human
coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS), including
SARS-CoV-1, and their accession codes are shown in supplementary table S2 and S3.
A total of 19 different primer/probe sets for RT-PCR were
obtained from Refs. [1–19], their full details are shown in supplementary table S4. Note that several publications include
primers from earlier reports. In particular, CDC primers [2]
are included in several publications. Therefore, for each set we
only considered those that were not repeated from other publications. Note that some primers and probes were designed for
both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [4, 14].

2.4. Coverage evaluation
We calculated the hybridization temperatures from Eq. (1)
for each primer/probe assuming a complete Watson-Crick complementarity which we called the reference temperature T ref. ,
which are shown in supplementary table S5.
All 19 primers/probes were aligned against NG genomes and
we kept only those alignments with up to three consecutive mismatches. The coverage for a strictly non-mismatched alignment
Cstrict was calculated as

2.2. Primer and genome alignment
Each primer or probe sequence is aligned against a given
genome using a Smith-Waterman algorithm [41], where matching base pairs AT and CG where given score 2, mismatches
score -1, and no gaps were considered. Alignments were carried
out in two strand configurations, first for the genome sequences
as obtained from the database and taking the primer/probe sequence as complementary strand

Cstrict =

50 −(unmodified target genome sequence)−30
30 −(primer/probe)−50

NG − Nn.a. − NMM
NG

(2)

where NG the total number of genomes which are at least
25000 bp in size, Nn.a. number of genomes for which no alignment was found, and NMM the number of genomes for which a
partial alignment with up to three consecutive mismatches was
found.
Next, for each of the NMM partial alignments we calculated
the hybridization temperatures T MM from Eq. (1) taking into account the mismatches, and the difference to the reference temperature T ref. is
∆T MM = T ref. − T MM
(3)

and next by taking the complementary of the genome sequence
50 −(complementary target genome sequence)−30
30 −(primer/probe)−50
These alignments are carried out regardless if the primer was
identified as forward or reverse. In all cases the nominal directions of the primers were identified correctly.

After aligning all primer/probe sets to all genomes we calculated their hybridization temperatures taking into account up to
three consecutive mismatches, as detailed in the methods section. Table 1 summarises all sets analysed, their range of reference hybridization temperatures, strict and partial coverage for
SARS-CoV-2 and for non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The detailed
results for each primer are shown in supplementary table S5 for
SARS-CoV-2. If the PCR primers can in principle bind to nonSARS-CoV-2 targets then this set may not specific [22]. Considering this, we analysed the 19 primer/probe sets in relation to
genomes of other coronaviruses (non-SARS) as well as SARSCoV-1 to verify if there was some cross-reactivity. The detailed
results are shown in supplementary tables S6 for SARS-COV-1,
and S7 for non-SARS viruses.
The typical design rules for PCR primers and probes recommend that the range of hybridization temperatures in a given
set should be narrow, of the order of 10 ◦ C [25, 43]. Several
authors even suggest that the range for primer pair should be
no more than 5◦ C [22, 44] or even less than 1◦ C [45]. However, it is evident, from table 1, that very few sets have temperature ranges below 10 ◦ C, while some even exceed 20 ◦ C.
For example, the Luminex set, which includes the primer/probe
set of China CDC, shows differences in the primer temperatures up to 21.6 ◦ C. However, when mismatches are considered the hybridization temperatures may go far below the design range. In Fig. 1 we show an example of a displacement
profile where a single AC mismatch completely disturbs the
surrounding AT base pairs and the hybridization temperature
drops to T MM = 48.5 ◦ C, down from a reference temperature
of T ref. = 61.1 ◦ . However, a presence of one or more mismatches does not necessarily imply in a reduction of hybridization temperature. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 89 RIGHT
primer when aligned to MT259228.1 has two consecutive mismatches towards the 50 end, see supplementary figure S1. Even
though these mismatches induce a small end fraying, it has a
calculated temperature of T MM = 68.7 ◦ C which is even somewhat higher than its reference temperature T ref. = 68.3 ◦ C. This
stability is caused by an increased stacking interaction between
the GA and AA mismatches [39].
In terms of SARS-CoV-2 strict coverage, most sets have
Cstrict typically beyond 90%, which is expected as the primer
design is guided by existing genomes. However, a number of

instead of CG (blue symbols).

specific probes, such as RdRp SARSr-P1-1 from Corman et al.
[4] go from 0 to 99.4% only if mismatches are taken into account. Indeed, as pointed out by Pillonel et al. [46] several of
the probes from Corman et al. [4] do not fully match the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (1623 at the time [46]). However,
it was also observed that the mismatches had little effect on
their efficiencies [13, 28] which is consistent with our calculations. The reason for the presence of mismatches in this case,
as explained in Corman and Drosten [28], was the incomplete
genomic information available at the time when this set was
designed. It is worth noticing that while accounting for mismatches increases the coverage of this particular primer/probe
set, it also increases the coverage for SARS-CoV-1 and even
non-SARS as shown in Tab. 1.
We observed that in some cases the presence of few mismatches substantially decrease the hybridization temperature,
leading to a complete absence of coverage. For example, four
primers from Vogels et al. [18] do not align with any genome
at all, not even when considering the mismatches as their hybridization temperatures T MM are too low in comparison to reference temperature T ref. . In contrast, for several cases when
mismatches are taken into account the coverage becomes almost complete. A special example is probe 2019-nCoV N1P from CDC set that had 223 further mismatch alignments
increasing the strict coverage of 98.4% to partial coverage
of 99.4% . Similar findings were observed for SARS-CoV2 6 LEFT [12] and NIID WH-1 F501 of WHO [1].
The cross-reactivity, that is, the coverage of SARS-Cov-1
and non-SARS, appear in most primer/probe sets when mismatches are taken into account. Of the 19 primer/probe sets,
we found only 5 sets that do not present cross-reactivity at all,
see Tab. 1.

4. Conclusion
We evaluated the impact of mismatches in the hybridization
of primers and probes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and
other genomes. We have shown that the effect of mismatches on
the probe/primer hybridization is not straightforward and can
only be fully evaluated with a detailed calculation with up-todate model parameters. In particular, our calculations showed
that a substantial amount of the existing primers/probes may
cross-react to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes, which
further highlights the need for taking mismatch hybridization
into account.
