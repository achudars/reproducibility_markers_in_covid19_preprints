Abstract
ADP-ribosylation is a protein modification responsible for biological processes such as DNA
repair, RNA regulation, cell cycle, and biomolecular condensate formation. Dysregulation of
ADP-ribosylation is implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration, and viral infection. We developed
ADPriboDB (adpribodb.leunglab.org) to facilitate studies in uncovering insights into the
mechanisms and biological significance of ADP-ribosylation. ADPriboDB 2.0 serves as a onestop repository comprising 48,346 entries and 9,097 ADP-ribosylated proteins, of which 6,708
were newly identified since the original database release. In this updated version, we provide
information regarding the sites of ADP-ribosylation in 32,946 entries. The wealth of information
allows us to interrogate existing databases or newly available data. For example, we found that
ADP-ribosylated substrates are significantly associated with the recently identified human
protein interaction networks associated with SARS-CoV-2, which encodes a conserved protein
domain called macrodomain that binds and removes ADP-ribosylation. In addition, we create a
new interactive tool to visualize the local context of ADP-ribosylation, such as structural and
functional features as well as other post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation,
methylation and ubiquitination). This information provides opportunities to explore the biology of
ADP-ribosylation and generate new hypotheses for experimental testing.

Introduction
ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification defined by the addition of
one [mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation] or multiple [poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation] ADP-ribose moieties onto
amino acid side chains with nucleophilic oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur (1, 2). ADP ribose groups
can be transferred by enzymatically active members of the family of 17 ADP-ribosyltransferases
(commonly known as PARPs) as well as other enzymes, such as bacterial toxins and sirtuins
(3–5). ADP-ribosylation has been implicated in fundamental biological processes (e.g., DNA
damage repair, gene regulation, and cell signaling) (6–8) as well as disease-related processes
(e.g., microbial pathogenesis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation) (9–11). While ADP-ribosylation
was discovered in 1963 (12), studies of ADP-ribosylation have recently begun to benefit from
the rapid development in proteomics technologies that identify ADP-ribosylated sites and
characterize the substrate specificity of PARPs and other enzymes associated with ADPribosylation (13). In light of these developments, we created ADPriboDB in 2015 (14) to provide
a one-stop informatics portal about ADP-ribosylated substrates across the proteomes from
different species, similar to databases like dbPTM (15, 16) and PhosphoSite (17) that provide
information about other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and
phosphorylation. In addition, ADPriboDB provides data entries pertaining to PARP inhibitor
effects on the ADP-ribosylated proteome, aiming to bridge basic scientific knowledge about
ADP ribosylation with information that physicians can use to garner insights on clinical benefits
and side effects.
ADPriboDB 2.0 includes an
expanded library of data, new addition of
site information, and an improved user
interface (Table 1). ADPriboDB 2.0 also
integrates other post-translational
modification sites and features a web
interface that allows users to visualize
protein domains and other features at
and proximal to the modification sites.

New Features
Expanded Library of Data
As in ADPriboDB, published papers were curated from PubMed, accessed via the following
search terms: ‘PARylation’ or ‘PARsylation’ or ‘poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation’ or ‘poly-adp-ribosylation’
or ‘poly(ADP-ribosylation)’ or ‘PARylated’ or ‘PARsylated’ or ‘poly(ADP)ribosylation’ or
‘MARylation’ or ‘MARsylation’ or ‘mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation’ or ‘mono-adp-ribosylation’ or
‘mono(ADP-ribosylation)’ or ‘MARylated’ or ‘MARsylated’ or ‘mono(ADP)ribosylated.’ Search
results were restricted between the dates of July 2015 and May 2019, where the initial release
covered between January 1975 and June 2015 (14). ADPriboDB 2.0 now also included the
terms ‘ADPr,’ ‘ADP-ribose,’ and ‘ADPribosylation’ for literature search between January 1975

and May 2019. Information regarding protein identifiers as well as experimental and modification
details were collected and assessed for inclusion in ADPriboDB by two independent curators.
Since 2010, research regarding ADP-ribosylation has accelerated, and particularly the
identification of ADP-ribosylated substrates has risen (Figure 1A). In light of these trends, the
latest iteration of ADPriboDB comprises 48,346 entries, including 9,097 unique proteins across
610 papers, more than tripling the size of the initial release of the database. The database now
includes data from 41 species, up from 28 species. ADPriboDB 2.0 has more than doubled the
proportion of its entries bearing information regarding the

enzyme responsible for the ADP-ribosylation. Reflecting a

greater availability of technology (e.g. analog-sensitive PARP

approaches), 65% of database entries include the

cache. These caches are generated for each individual user.
This feature allows the display of the frequently visited

pages, thereby speeding-up the process of information
loading and display.
In ADPriboDB 2.0, a growing number of entries were derived from proteomics studies,
which account for ~8,000 unique proteins (Figure 1B). ~75% of ADP-ribosylated proteins were
identified in at least two publications (Figure 1C). Analysis of these independently verified ADPribosylated substrates via EnrichR (18) revealed a significant enrichment of gene sets
associated with diverse biological processes, including DNA metabolism, RNA processing,
protein targeting, and viral-related processes (Figure 1D; Supplementary Data S1).
This expanded database therefore provides greater flexibility and depth to analyses of
ADP-ribosylation, its function, and its clinical implications. As an example, we used ADPriboDB
to explore the biology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
SARS-CoV-2 encodes a protein domain (called macrodomain) that is conserved in all
coronaviruses (19, 20), and this macrodomain binds and hydrolyzes ADP-ribose from
substrates (21, 22), as in other viral macrodomains. Given the conserved nature of
macrodomain and the critical importance of the enzymatic activity of macrodomain in the
virulence of other coronaviruses (19, 20), ADP-ribosylation is likely highly regulated in SARSCoV-2 infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, human protein interactors of SARS-CoV-2 viral
proteins (23) are statistically enriched with ADP-ribosylated substrates (p=0.0096, Chi-square
test with continuity correction) (Supplementary Data S2). No statistical significance was
observed between SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors with the methylated proteomes (p=0.1977,
Chi-square test with continuity correction). Notably, this statistical enrichment with ADPribosylated substrates was present even though the SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map did
not include the association with nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), which possesses the
macrodomain (23). These ADP-ribosylated substrates associated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins

were enriched with gene ontologies, including transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA regulation
(Figure 1E, Supplementary Data S2).

Increased Availability of ADP-ribosylation Site Information
For the last six years, evolving proteomics techniques have allowed the identification of
sites of ADP-ribosylation for functional analyses (13, 24). During curation of database entries,
information regarding modified sites and/or peptide sequences identified by mass spectrometry
were included when available. Sequence information was then aligned to protein sequences
deposited in the UniProt database (25). Currently, ~67% of ADPriboDB 2.0 entries includes
information regarding ADP-ribosylation sites, with a total of 14,839 unique sites on a range of
amino acids (Figure 1F). For each database entry, users can view the site and sequence
information provided by the publication. Users can also find out whether the same sites were
identified in other publications or whether there are other ADP-ribosylation sites from the same
proteins.
Enhanced User Interface Features
The new site information enables users to identify potential crosstalks between ADPribosylation and other post-translational modifications. ADPriboDB 2.0 currently features sites of
phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, sourced from dbPTM (15, 16). To facilitate
correlation analyses, ADPriboDB 2.0 includes a new Shiny-based tool to visualize the local
structural and functional context of ADP-ribosylation sites, such as other post-translational
modification sites, protein domains, as well as regions of protein-protein interaction. Vertical
black lines are drawn to denote the location of ADP-ribosylation sites. For example, a high
frequency of Axin1 ADP-ribosylation was found to localize around the motif that binds
tankyrases—i.e., PARP5a and PARP5b (Figure 2A).
To help identify ADP-ribosylation sites of high confidence, the number of publications
that identified a given modified site is now provided. So far, ~7% of sites (1,018 unique sites)
listed in the database have been identified by at least two publications (Supplementary Figure
S1). The varying grey level of the vertical black lines corresponds to the number of publications
identifying that particular site in a given protein. Users can then gauge the “confidence” of a
particular ADP-ribosylation site for mutagenesis studies. For example, E488 and E491 within
the automodification domain of PARP1 were identified in more than 10 independent studies
(Supplementary Data S3, Figure 2B).
Besides, users can toggle zoom settings to visualize crowded regions at a single amino
acid level (Figure 2C). For example, S195 in NPM1 within the nuclear localization signal were
identified 4 times, and this site can also be phosphorylated (Figure 2C). Taken together, all
these additional features enable users to prioritize which sites for further mechanistic analyses.

Conclusions and Future Development
ADPriboDB v2.0 was updated in response to the growing volume of data regarding novel
substrates and sites of ADP-ribosylation. We anticipate the wealth of site information will
stimulate new mechanistic studies, especially with the advent of new chemical approaches to
generate model ADP-ribosylated peptides and methods to label ADP-ribose (27, 28). Given that
the database now includes a considerable amount of site and sequence information, we hope
the database will encourage the development of novel algorithms for motif finding, site
prediction, and correlation analyses with various post-translational modifications (29, 30).
With the development of chemical inhibitors and genetic ablation technologies (such as
CRISPR) that can target specific PARPs, we anticipate future generations of ADPriboDB will
include more information regarding substrate-enzyme specificity. As ADP-ribosylhydrolases also
exhibit amino acid specificity (31), future entries may include information of enzymes that add
and remove ADP-ribosylation from specific sites. Emergent studies indicate that cellular

processes are not only regulated by the balance between the synthesis and removal of ADPribosylation, but also by maintaining the appropriate forms of ADP-ribosylation (32). Although
mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation cannot be distinguished by the current
proteomics methods (13), future entries will be focused on annotating this critical chain length
information, especially when appropriate technologies are mature (28, 33).
