Abstract

23

Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong

24

infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of

25

the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung,

26

little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for

27

lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of

28

published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T

29

cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on

30

the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the

31

lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and

32

influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar

33

lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors

34

displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing

35

receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19.

36

Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or

37

CCR5+ NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients,

38

identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral

39

infections.

Introduction

51

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe

52

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need for a better

53

understanding of respiratory viral infections which have the potential to cause recurrent

54

epidemics or pandemics. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also includes influenza virus,

55

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

56

(MERS)-CoV. Future disease outbreaks with novel viruses affecting the airways are to be

57

expected and prepared for.

58

During acute infections with respiratory viruses such as with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza,

59

specific chemokines mediating leukocyte recruitment are increased in the lung and

60

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. These chemokines include CCL2, CCL3, CCL20,

61

CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, and IL8, attracting cells expressing chemokine receptors such as

62

CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR6 (1-3). In patients suffering from severe COVID-19, recent

63

reports suggest exacerbated lung tissue damage and epithelial cell death resulting from

64

hyperactivated immune cells, such as inflammatory macrophages (1), natural killer (NK) cells

65

(4) and/or T cells (1,5). While moderate disease in COVID-19 and in influenza patients is per

66

definition not fatal, patients may still require hospitalization and/or experience persistent long-

67

term symptoms such as fatigue, respiratory problems, loss of taste or smell, headache, and

68

diarrhea. Since lung-homing cytotoxic lymphocytes are likely involved in lung pathology

69

during acute infection, a better understanding of their major homing mechanisms will help in

70

developing and improving treatment strategies in COVID-19 and other respiratory viral

71

infections.

72

In this study, we investigated the composition of NK cell and T cell subsets which are

73

equipped with lung-homing properties in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from

74

moderate COVID-19 or influenza, and in healthy controls. In addition to analyses by 28-colour

75

flow cytometry, we assessed transcript expression in NK cells and T cells using three publicly

76

available single cell (sc)RNA-seq datasets of cells from peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar

77

lavage, respectively (6-8). Our data indicate a universal role for CXCR3-mediated lung-homing

78

of NK cells and T cells in COVID-19 and influenza and an additional role for recruitment via

79

CXCR6 and CCR5.

80

Together, we provide an extensive characterization of the lung-homing potential of

81

functional NK cells and T cells in homeostasis and acute respiratory viral infections such as

82

COVID-19 and influenza. The present results are of relevance for the understanding of the

83

disease progression and for identifying target molecules to improve future therapeutic treatment

84

strategies.

Results

86

Altered frequencies of chemokine receptor-positive NK cell and T cell subsets in

87

peripheral blood in COVID-19 and influenza patients

88

Chemokine receptors relevant for lung-homing such as CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5,

89

could be identified in all detectable NK and T cell subsets in peripheral blood both from healthy

90

donors and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1a, b; see Fig. S1a for gating strategies). The frequency

91

of chemokine receptor-positive NK cell and T cell subsets was decreased in COVID-19 patients

92

(Fig. 1a, b). Unbiased analysis of single chemokine receptors revealed a loss of CXCR2+,

93

CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and CCR2+ cells despite an increase in the frequency of CCR5+ NK cells

94

and T cells, respectively (Fig. 1c). When compared to influenza patients, we observed only

95

minor and non-significant differences for chemokine receptor expression on NK cells in both

96

diseases (Fig. 1d, e). Notably, a strong trend towards a loss of CXCR3+ NK cells in COVID-19

97

and influenza patients was observed (Fig. 1d, e). Lower frequencies of CXCR6+ NK cells were

98

accompanied with an increase in CCR5+CD56brightCD16- NK cells in influenza but not in

99

COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1d, e). In contrast to NK cells, in particular CD8+ T cells were

100

significantly affected both in COVID-19 and influenza patients (Fig. 1f, g). Similar to NK cells,

101

CXCR3+ T cells were markedly reduced most, both in COVID-19 and influenza. Additionally,

102

CXCR6+CD8+ T cells were reduced in influenza (Fig. 1f, g). Changes in chemokine receptor

103

expression were observed both in naïve and non-naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. S2a, b;

104

gating strategy in Fig. S1a) and likewise when CD8+ TCM, TEM, and TEMRA cells were

105

compared (Fig. S2c). Unbiased principal component analysis (PCA) revealed segregation

106

between healthy controls and influenza patients for NK cells as well as between COVID-19

107

and influenza patients for T cells, respectively (Fig. 1h-j). The differences were largely driven

108

by CXCR3 and CCR5 for NK cells and by CCR5 on CD4+ T cells as well as by CCR2, CXCR3,

109

and CXCR6 on CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1i). Together, despite differences between NK cells and

110

CD8+ T cells, both lymphocyte subsets displayed a similar pattern in terms of CXCR3 and

111

CXCR6 expression in COVID-19 and influenza patients, with T cells being more strongly

112

affected.

113

In order to compare the present phenotypic results, with those of other data collections,

114

we analyzed two publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from peripheral blood from a different

115

cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with moderate COVID-19 disease (6) (Fig. 1k) and

116

from patients infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) (7) (Fig. 1l),

117

respectively. In order to allow a fair comparison of the RNA-seq data to the present dataset, we

118

selectively analyzed data from patients with similar clinical characteristics. This analysis

119

revealed differences of chemokine receptor expression between NK cells and T cells at the

120

mRNA level in peripheral blood. While CXCR2 was largely confined to NK cells, CCR2 and

121

CCR5 dominated in T cells, both in healthy controls and in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1k) (6).

122

Lower average expression of CXCR3 was found in all three lymphocyte subsets (NK cells,

123

CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells) in COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1k).

124

However, in contrast to protein data, CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5 were strongly increased both

125

in frequency and in mean intensity in T cells in COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy

126

controls (Fig. 1k), suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of these chemokine receptors.

127

Finally, direct comparative analysis of transcript expression of CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR6, and

128

CCR5 revealed stronger loss of CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR6 in NK cells from influenza

129

patients as compared to COVID-19 patients as well as a trend towards upregulation of CCR5

130

(Fig. 1l) (7), in line with the similarly observed trend at the protein level (Fig. 1d, e) and

131

suggesting a role for these chemokine receptors particularly in influenza infection. While

132

CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5 are predominantly expressed on CD56brightCD16- NK cells

133

in peripheral blood from healthy controls and patients with COVID-19 or influenza,

134

respectively, CXCR2 is strongly expressed on CD56dimCD16+ blood NK cells (Fig. S2d, e). In

135

COVID-19 patients, CXCR2+CD56dimCD16+ NK cells were mainly lost within the least

136

differentiated NKG2A+CD57- subset (Fig. S2f). On T cells, CXCR2 expression was overall

137

low, without significant differences between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients (Fig.

138

S2g, h).

139

Together, the present phenotypic analyses indicate that CXCR3 is a common lung-

140

homing receptor for both NK cells and T cell subsets during acute infection with COVID-19 or

141

influenza, despite major differences for CXCR6, CCR2, and CCR5 between the two diseases at

142

transcriptional level. Furthermore, CXCR6+ NK and T cells were strongly affected in influenza

143

but not in COVID-19 patients, indicating potential differences in homing capacities in the two

144

diseases.

145
146

Activation profiles in chemokine-receptor positive NK cells differ in COVID-19 and

147

influenza

148

We and others previously demonstrated an activated phenotype in peripheral blood NK

149

cells and T cells in COVID-19 and influenza, respectively (4,9,10). Here, we aimed at

150

identifying NK and T cell activation markers in relation to expression of lung-homing receptors

151

as identified by boolean gating, combining cells expressing either CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, or

152

CCR5 (Fig. S1b, c). Expression of activation markers such as CD69, CD38, Ki67, and NKG2D

153

was elevated on NK cells in moderate COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2a, b), with strongest increases

154

detected for CD69 and Ki67 (Fig. 2b, c). In detail, induction of CD69 expression was highest

155

on CD56brightCD16- NK cells co-expressing lung-homing receptors, while Ki67 induction was

156

highest in corresponding CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, particularly in those co-expressing lung-

157

homing receptors (Fig. 2c). Due to very low numbers of CD56brightCD16- NK cells lacking any

158

relevant chemokine receptor in healthy controls, no comparisons could be performed for this

159

subset. In contrast to NK cells from COVID-19 patients, upregulation of CD69 was highest in

160

CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in influenza patients, irrespective of co-expression of lung-homing

161

receptors (Fig. 2d, e, f). Expression and upregulation of CD38 was similar in COVID-19 and

162

influenza patients (Fig 2c, f). While these data indicate fundamental differences in activation

163

patterns for NK cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients, other phenotypic characteristics

164

remained stable between the two diseases (Fig. S3a, b), despite induction of granzymes and

165

perforin observed in particular in chemokine receptor-positive CD56brightCD16- NK cells (Fig.

166

S3c-f). In the latter subset, upregulation of perforin expression was three times higher in

167

influenza patients as compared to COVID-19 patients (Fig. S3e, f), indicating stronger

168

activation of blood NK cells in influenza.

169

As indicated by transcript level, CXCR2 might have an additional role in lung-homing

170

for NK cells. Since activation affected both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells in COVID-19

171

patients, we next sought to determine changes in CXCR2+ expression (Fig. 2g, h). In this regard,

172

expression of CXCR2 was higher on CD56dimCD16+ NK cells lacking other lung-homing

173

receptors (Fig. 2g). The frequency of this CXCR2+CD56dimCD16+ NK cell subset was

174

significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy controls (Fig. 2h),

175

indicating an alternative migration mechanism for CXCR2+CD56dimCD16+ NK cells to the lung

176

in COVID-19 patients.

177

Together, our data show that the activation patterns differ for NK cell subsets in

178

COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively, with generally stronger activation of blood NK

179

cells in influenza as compared to moderate COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the data suggest

180

that CXCR2 might act as an alternative lung-homing receptor for CD56dimCD16+ NK cells

181

lacking other lung-homing receptors.

183

Biased activation of T cells co-expressing lung-homing receptors in COVID-19 and

185

Since NK cell subset activation in COVID-19 and influenza is associated with

186

chemokine receptor expression, we next determined whether T cells expressing lung-homing

187

receptors displayed an equivalent phenotypic bias towards stronger activation of chemokine

188

receptor-positive T cells (Fig. 3). Similar to NK cells, a larger proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T

189

cells expressed CD69, both in COVID-19 (Fig. 3a, c) and influenza (Fig. 3b, c) compared to

190

healthy controls. While in COVID-19 patients CD69 upregulation was biased towards CD8+ T

191

cells co-expressing lung-homing receptors (Fig. 3a, c), upregulation was overall higher and

192

more uniform between the T cell subsets in influenza (Fig. 3b, c). Furthermore, CD38 was

193

strongly upregulated on CD8+ T cells in influenza but not COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3c). Finally,

194

expression of Ki67 was largely confined to chemokine receptor-positive T cells, both in healthy

195

controls and in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3a). Upregulation of Ki67 was strongest in chemokine

196

receptor-positive CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3c), which is in line with strongest upregulation in

197

CD56dimCD16+ chemokine receptor-positive NK cells (Fig. 2c), indicating a particular

198

activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes expressing lung-homing receptors in COVID-19 patients.

199

In comparison to NK cells where upregulation of granzymes and perforin was more

200

uniform between COVID-19 and influenza patients (Fig. S3), differences were more distinct

201

for T cells (Fig. 3d-f). As to be expected, expression of cytotoxic effector molecules was to a

202

large extent contained to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3d, f), although some expression was also

203

observed in CD4+ T cells both in COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively, with a

204

particular bias towards chemokine receptor-negative CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3e, f). Expression of

205

granzyme B and perforin was highest in chemokine receptor-negative CD8+ T cells in healthy

206

controls as well as in COVID-19 and influenza patients (Fig. 3d, e). Importantly, however,

207

lung-homing receptor-positive T cells displayed the highest increase compared to the same

208

subset in healthy controls (Fig. 3f).

209

Together, these data indicate an overall stronger in vivo priming of T cells and NK cells

210

in influenza patients as compared to moderate COVID-19 patients and also suggest a specific

211

role for cytotoxic lymphocytes co-expressing lung-homing receptors.

215

Activation of cytotoxic NK cells and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 and influenza patients

216

was associated with high expression of effector molecules (Fig. S3, Fig. 3). Stratification of

217

cells based on expression of chemokine receptors, granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin

218

revealed distinct co-expression patterns between CD56brightCD16- and CD56dimCD16+ NK cells

219

and CD8+ T cells as well as between COVID-19 and influenza (Fig. 4a). Shared between the

220

different subsets and between COVID-19 and influenza was an increase of all effector

221

molecules particularly on chemokine receptor-positive cells. Increased expression of effector

222

molecules could also be confirmed at transcriptional level both for NK cells (Fig. 4b) and CD8+

223

T cells (Fig. 4c) in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy controls (6).

224

Interestingly, levels of effector molecules gene transcripts were nearly identical between

225

ventilated (severe) and non-ventilated (moderate) COVID-19 patients, both in NK cells (Fig.

226

4b) and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4c), indicating that similar NK and T cell activation is similar in

227

patients with moderate and severe disease.

228

The loss of NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors in the peripheral

229

blood of COVID-19 patients suggests migration of the respective cells to the infected lung

230

tissue. In order to identify characteristics of NK cells and T cells in the lung, we next used a

231

publicly available scRNAseq dataset from BAL fluid cells from COVID-19 patients (8) and

232

analyzed expression of transcripts of relevant chemokines in total BAL cells (Fig. 4d) as well

233

as chemokine receptor expression on NK cells and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4e). High transcript levels

234

of a large number of chemokines were found in patients with severe disease, while moderate

235

patients were mainly distinguished from healthy patients by a significantly upregulated

236

expression of CXCL10 and CCL5, in addition to increased levels of CXCL11 and CXCL16 (Fig.

237

4d), highlighting the role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in moderate COVID-19. In line with

238

these results, transcripts for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 were highly enriched in NK cells as

239

well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients with moderate disease (Fig. 4e).

240

Although it is possible that some of the cells in BAL fluid are comprised of tissue-resident NK

241

cells and memory T cells which express high levels of CXCR3 and CXCR6 at the

242

transcriptional and protein levels (11,12), our data strongly suggest infiltration of NK cells and

243

T cells from peripheral blood into the lung in COVID-19 patients. Since NK cells and CD8+ T

244

cells from peripheral blood displayed upregulated levels of effector molecules, these cells might

245

have important cytotoxic implications upon infiltration into the lung. Indeed, NK cells and

246

CD8+ T cells in BAL fluid from COVID-19 patients displayed increased expression levels of

247

GZMA, GZMB, and PRF1 in patients with moderate and severe disease (Fig. 4e, f). We

248

previously demonstrated that exposure to IAV-infected cells functionally primes human blood

249

and lung NK cells in vitro towards increased target cell-responsiveness (9). However, despite

250

phenotypic activation and upregulation of effector molecules both at RNA and protein levels,

251

blood NK cells from patients with moderate COVID-19 showed no elevated responses to K562

252

target cells as compared to healthy controls (Fig. 4h, i). Instead, NK cell responses were slightly

253

reduced with time after symptom onset (Fig. 4j). While our data suggest a low state of NK cell

254

activation in peripheral blood of patients with moderate COVID-19, it remains to be determined

255

whether NK cells migrating towards the lungs remain functional and contribute to lysis of virus-

256

infected cells and possibly even to tissue pathology in patients with moderate or severe COVID-

257

19.

258

Altogether, our data suggest distinct recruitment of CXCR3+ and CXCR6+ NK cells and

259

CD8+ T cells to the lung in patients with moderate COVID-19 and influenza, indicating

260

overlapping recruitment mechanisms in these two respiratory viral infections. Hence, a better

261

understanding of lung-homing of innate and adaptive cytotoxic lymphocytes in COVID-19 and

Discussion

265

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the awareness about the need for a better understanding

266

of the course of respiratory viral infections. So far, only a few studies have compared immune

267

responses in COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections side by side (13) (14,15). Here,

268

we compared COVID-19 with influenza. Both viruses are to different degrees transmitted by

269

contact, droplets and fomites. They cause respiratory disease with similar disease presentation

270

ranging from asymptomatic or mild to severe disease and death. Here, we demonstrate that NK

271

cells and T cells, in particular CD8+ T cells, largely overlap in their chemokine receptor

272

expression profile in the blood of COVID-19 and influenza, indicating similar lung-homing

273

mechanisms for cytotoxic lymphocytes in both infections. We identified a stronger loss of

274

CXCR3+ and CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells, overall stronger activation of NK cells and T cells, as well

275

as reduced transcript level expression of lung-homing receptors in the blood of influenza

276

patients as compared to COVID-19 patients with moderate disease, in line with the recent

277

observation of a lower inflammatory profile in COVID-19 patients as compared to influenza

278

patients (14). The activated profile of NK cells and CD8+ T cells, including elevated expression

279

of CD69 and Ki67, and induction of perforin, was biased towards subsets co-expressing one or

280

more of the lung-homing receptors CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR6, CCR2, or CCR5. Levels of

281

corresponding leukocyte-recruiting chemokines such as IL-8, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2,

282

CXCL5, and CXCL10 (IP-10), are elevated in the BAL fluid of patients infected with SARS-

283

CoV-2 (16,17). Monocytes producing ligands for CXCR3 have been shown to be expanded in

284

the lungs of COVID-19 patients (8). Data regarding chemokine expression in the lung in

285

influenza are limited to patients with fatal outcome (2). However, in particular CXCL10 has

286

been shown to be upregulated in serum of influenza patients (18,19) and in SARS-CoV-1

287

patients with ARDS (20), in in vitro influenza virus-infected human macrophages (21), in

288

human lung tissue explants infected with SARS-CoV-2 (16), and in the lungs of mice infected

289

with influenza virus (3,22,23), suggesting a predominant role for the CXCR3:CXCL10 axis for

290

lung-homing upon respiratory viral infection and, interestingly, also in non-viral lung tissue

291

injury (24). Elevated CXCL10 levels in BAL was associated with longer duration of mechanical

292

ventilation in COVID-19 patients (17). In mice, CXCR3-deficiency rescued CCR5-deficient

293

mice from IAV-induced mortality (25). Other murine IAV infection models demonstrated a

294

role for CXCR3 and CCR5 for NK cell lung-homing and showed NK cell accumulation in the

295

lung was not due to proliferation or apoptosis (23). For CD8+ T cells, murine models

296

demonstrated that virus-specific T cells express CXCR3 and migrate to CXCR3 ligands in vitro

297

(26). Furthermore, CCR5 is required for recruitment of memory CD8+ T cells to IAV-infected

298

epithelium and is rapidly upregulated on the surface of memory CD8+ T cells upon viral

299

challenge (26). Interestingly, these mouse models also revealed that CCR5 is required for

300

circulating CD8+ memory T cells to migrate to respiratory airways but not lung parenchyma

301

during virus challenge (26), indicating potential distinct migration patterns depending on

302

chemokine receptor expression. In addition to CCR5 and CXCR3, CXCR6 has been suggested

303

to be of importance for recruitment of resident memory T cells to the airways both in mice (12)

304

and in moderate COVID-19 (8).

305

The relevance of the CXCR3:CXCL10 axis for lung tissue-homing of cytotoxic immune

306

cells such as NK cells and CD8+ T cells might be of interest for future approaches of

307

intervention. Antibody-mediated targeting of CXCL10 improved survival of H1N1-infected

308

mice (27), revealing a novel approach for immunotherapy in patients with severe respiratory

309

viral infections. A thorough review recently summarized relevant known factors and cells

310

involved in lung-homing during infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, emphasizing the

311

role of circulating NK cells not only in terms of their cytotoxic potential but also in potentially

312

facilitating the recruitment of other cell types such as neutrophils (28). The potential

313

immunoregulatory roles of NK cells in the human lung in health and disease however remains

314

to be studied further.

315

Despite the parallels between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection, both diseases

316

differ at an immunological level including that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect NK cells or other

317

mononuclear blood cells due to the lack of ACE2 expression (29), while influenza virus can

318

infect NK cells (30). In contrast to influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other organs if

319

not cleared efficiently from the respiratory tract (31), and the viruses induce different antiviral

320

responses in lung epithelial cells (32).

321

Here, we demonstrate common lung-homing potential of circulating NK cells and CD8+

322

T cells in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza patients. A shortcoming of our study is a low number of

323

patients, impeding a detailed stratification by clinical or other parameters. However, the present

324

cohort was limited to clinically well-defined patients with moderate disease. Future studies will

325

assess how acute respiratory viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and other

326

viruses affects the landscape of activated NK cells and T cells in the lung.

327

Together, our results strongly implicate an importance of CXCR3 as a lung-homing

328

receptor in respiratory viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in humans.

329

The results also reveal a role for other receptors such as CXCR6, CCR5 on CD56brightCD16-

330

NK cells, as well as CXCR2 on CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, as potential alternative receptors of

331

importance. A better understanding of how these chemokine receptors are affecting disease

332

progression might help to develop future immunotherapeutic interventions in patients that

333

developed disease in current or future epidemics or pandemics with respiratory viral infections.

Material and Methods

335

Patients and processing of peripheral blood

336

We enrolled a total of 10 hospitalized patients (four females and six males; age range 24-70;

337

average age 55.3) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 in

338

respiratory samples. Patients were sampled on average 11 days (range 6-16) after symptom

339

onset. All of the COVID-19 patients were considered ‘moderate’ based on the guidelines for

340

diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Version 7) released by the National Health Commission

341

and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (33). Furthermore, we enrolled 18

342

patients who tested positive for IAV (n=12) or IBV (n=6) (nine females and nine males; age

343

range 21-84; median age 45) by RT-qPCR who were recruited during the four months

344

immediately preceding the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Stockholm region. Nine of the 18

345

influenza patients were hospitalized.

346

None of the COVID-19 patients and only one of the influenza patients received

347

immunosuppressive treatment. Diagnostics for all patients were performed at the diagnostic

348

laboratory at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Patients were sampled

349

on average 5 days (range 1-11) after symptom onset. Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood

350

were isolated by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep). For each of the two separate

351

cohorts, blood was collected from healthy blood donors and processed in parallel with patient

352

samples.

353

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden,

354

and by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. All donors provided informed written consent

355

prior to blood sampling.

356
357

Transcriptome analysis

358

Preprocessed and annotated scRNA-seq datasets of cells from peripheral blood and BAL fluid

359

from healthy controls, COVID patients, and influenza patients were obtained in RDS formats

360

from published data (6-8). The data was read and analyzed using Seurat (v3.2.2). Quality

361

filtering and cell and cluster annotations were retained from the respective publications. The

362

datasets were scaled and transformed using the SCTransform function with mitochondrial gene

363

expression regressed out, this was repeated after excluding populations and groups.

364

Differentially expressed genes present in at least 25% of the cells were determined in a pairwise

365

manner comparing patient groups using the sctransform outcome and the FindMarkers function

366

implemented in Seurat. NK cells and T cell subsets were selected separately and analyzed based

367

on patient group for transcript expression of chemokine receptors and effector molecules. CD4+

368

T cells and CD8+ T cells were identified from the BAL T cell subset based on expression of

369

CD4 and CD8. NK cells and T cell populations were further studied in only moderate and non-

370

ventilated COVID patients in the datasets from peripheral blood and BAL fluid, respectively.

371
372

Flow cytometry

373

Antibodies and clones used for phenotyping are listed in supplementary table 1. Secondary

374

staining was performed with streptavidin BUV630 (BD Biosciences) and Live/Dead Aqua

375

(Invitrogen). After surface staining, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were fixed

376

and permeabilized using FoxP3/Transcription Factor staining kit (eBioscience).

377

Samples were analyzed on a BD LSR Fortessa equipped with four lasers (BD

378

Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo version 9.5.2 and version 10.7.1 (Tree Star

379

Inc). UMAPs were constructed in FlowJo 10.7.1 using the UMAP plugin. For calculation of

380

the UMAP, the following parameters were included: CXCR3, CCR7, GzmA, GzmB, Perforin,

381

FceR1g, NKG2C, Ki67, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD38, CXCR2, CD3, CXCR6, CD4, CD57,
