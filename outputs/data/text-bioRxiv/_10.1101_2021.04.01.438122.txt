Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, is found on pericytes, contractile cells
enwrapping capillaries that regulate brain, heart and kidney blood flow. ACE2
converts vasoconstricting angiotensin II into vasodilating angiotensin-(1-7). In brain
slices from hamster, which has an ACE2 sequence similar to human ACE2,
angiotensin II alone evoked only a small capillary constriction, but evoked a large
pericyte-mediated capillary constriction generated by AT1 receptors in the presence
of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The effect of the RBD was
mimicked by blocking ACE2. A mutated non-binding RBD did not potentiate
constriction. A similar RBD-potentiated capillary constriction occurred in human
cortical slices. This constriction reflects an RBD-induced decrease in the conversion
of angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). The clinically-used drug losartan inhibited the
RBD-potentiated constriction. Thus AT1 receptor blockers could be protective in
SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing pericyte-mediated blood flow reductions in the
brain, and perhaps the heart and kidney.

Introduction
Despite the primary site of infection by SARS-CoV-2 being the respiratory tract, the
virus evokes dysfunction of many other organs, including the brain, heart and kidney: 36% of
hospitalised patients show neurological symptoms1, 20% develop myocardial injury2 and
41% experience acute kidney injury3. This could reflect either a spread of virus via the
blood4, or the effects of inflammatory mediators released from the lungs. These effects may
contribute to “long Covid”, in which clouding of thought and physical exhaustion extend for
months after the initial infection.
The receptor5,6 for SARS-CoV-2 is the enzyme ACE2 (part of the renin-angiotensin
system that regulates blood pressure), which converts7 vasoconstricting angiotensin II into
vasodilating angiotensin-(1-7). The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to trigger its

endocytosis6. For the closely-related SARS virus, binding of only the receptor binding
domain (RBD) is sufficient8 to evoke internalisation of ACE2.
In the heart9 and brain10 the main cells expressing ACE2 are pericytes enwrapping
capillaries (and some endothelial cells), and pancreas and lung pericytes also express
ACE211,12. Pericytes express contractile proteins and in pathological conditions have been
shown to decrease blood flow in the brain13,14, heart15 and kidney16. Interestingly, a decrease
of blood flow has been reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain17 and kidney18. This
could be due to pericyte dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 reducing the activity of ACE2,
either by occluding its binding site for angiotensin II (although this is thought not to occur for
the related SARS virus19) or by promoting internalisation of the enzyme6,8. In the presence of
angiotensin II (either renally-derived and reaching the brain parenchyma via a compromised
blood-brain barrier, or generated by the brain’s own renin-angiotensin system20), a reduction
of ACE2 activity would increase the concentration of vasoconstricting angiotensin II and
decrease the concentration of vasodilating angiotensin-(1-7).

Results
Angiotensin II evokes pericyte-mediated capillary constriction via AT1 receptors
To study the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD on cerebral capillary pericyte function,
we employed live imaging21 of brain slices from Syrian golden hamsters. Hamsters have an
ACE2 Spike sequence which is more similar to that in humans than is the rat and mouse
ACE2 Spike sequence22. In particular amino acid 353 in hamsters and humans is a lysine
(K) rather than a histidine (H), and this is a key determinant23 of how well coronaviruses bind
to ACE2, making hamsters a good model for studying SARS-CoV-2 effects22.
We assessed the location of ACE2 and contractile properties of pericytes in the
cerebral microvasculature of the hamster, which have not been studied previously (Fig. 1).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed ACE2 to be predominantly expressed in capillary
pericytes expressing NG2 and PDGFR (Fig. 1a). Quantification of overlap with the pericyte

marker PDGFR (Fig. 1b) revealed ~75% co-localisation (Fig. 1c), and comparison of
expression in capillaries and arterioles showed that capillaries exhibited ~75% of the ACE2
expression (Fig. 1d). These results are consistent with transcriptome and IHC data from
mouse and human brain10 and human heart9. As for brain pericytes in rats24, the
thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 (200 nM) evoked a pericyte-mediated capillary
constriction and superimposed glutamate evoked a dilation (Fig. 1e).
Applying angiotensin II (150 nM) evoked a transient constriction, which was inhibited
by the AT1 receptor blocker losartan (20 M, Fig. 1f). Similar angiotensin-evoked pericytemediated capillary constriction has been reported in the kidney25 and retina26. The transience
of the constriction might reflect receptor desensitisation27 at this relatively high angiotensin II
concentration, or a delayed activation of Mas receptors after the angiotensin II is converted
to angiotensin (1-7). Blocking either AT2 receptors (with 1 M PD123319) or Mas receptors
(with 10 M A779) increased the angiotensin II evoked constriction (approximately 4.5-fold
for MasR block, p<10-4, Fig. 1g-h), consistent with the AT1R-mediated constriction being
opposed by angiotensin II activating AT2 receptors, by angiotensin-(1-7) activating Mas
receptors, or by activation of AT2/Mas heteromeric28 receptors.
SARS-CoV-2 binding potentiates angiotensin II evoked capillary constriction
Acute application of the RBD of Covid 19 (at 0.7 mg/l, or ~22.5 nM, which is
approximately 5 times the EC50 for binding29) for up to 40 mins evoked a small and
statistically insignificant reduction of capillary diameter at pericytes (Fig. 2a). On applying a
very high level of angiotensin II (2 M) in the absence of RBD, a transient constriction of
capillaries at pericytes was observed (6.3±3.6% in 6 capillaries, not significantly different
from the 7.5±1.6% observed using 150 nM angiotensin II in 9 capillaries in Fig. 1f, p=0.73).
However, if brain slices were exposed for 30 min to RBD (0.7 mg/l) before the same
concentration of angiotensin II was applied together with the RBD, then the angiotensin II
evoked a 5-fold larger constriction of 31.5±9.3% in 4 capillaries (significantly different to that
seen in the absence of RBD, p=0.019, Fig. 2b). The 30 min pre-exposure period was used in

order to allow time for the large RBD molecule to diffuse into the slice, and was mimicked for
the experiments without the RBD. This large constriction-potentiating effect of the RBD was
not a non-specific effect on the pericytes’ contractile apparatus, because the contractile
response to U46619 (200 nM) was unaffected by the RBD (Fig. 2c).
The high concentration of angiotensin II used in Fig. 2b is probably unphysiological
and evokes a transient response for reasons that are discussed above. We therefore
switched to a lower angiotensin II concentration (50 nM, Fig. 2d), which is more similar to
levels found physiologically within the kidney30,31 and heart32. In the presence of the RBD,
the constricting response to angiotensin II was increased from an insignificant dilation of
-4.5±3.0% to 7.8±3.6% (9 capillaries each, p=0.02), i.e. effectively a constriction of ~12%
(from 100*{1 - (92.2%/104.5%)}).
Using surface plasmon resonance to assess binding of RBD mutants to immobilised
ACE2, we identified the Y489R mutation as reducing binding by ~94% (Fig. 2e). Applying
this mutated RBD (for which glycosylation of the protein is expected to be the same as for
the normal RBD) had essentially no effect on the response to angiotensin II (Fig. 2d, f).
Thus, the potentiation of the angiotensin II response by the RBD is a result of it binding to
ACE2.
The RBD effect is mimicked by blocking ACE2, and blocked by losartan
We hypothesised that the potentiating effect of the RBD on the response to
angiotensin II reflects a decrease in the conversion by ACE2 of vasoconstricting angiotensin
II into vasodilating angiotensin-(1-7). Such a decrease is expected if RBD binding promotes
ACE2 internalisation6,8 or if it occludes the angiotensin II binding site. We therefore tested
the effect of an ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760, 1 M33) on the response to 50 nM angiotensin II.
This closely mimicked the potentiating effect of the RBD, confirming that the RBD reduces
effective ACE2 activity (Fig. 3a, b).
With a view to reducing SARS-CoV-2 evoked capillary constriction and any
associated reduction of microvascular blood flow, we tested whether the AT1 receptor

blocker losartan prevented the constricting effect of the RBD. Losartan completely blocked
the angiotensin II evoked constriction seen in the presence of the RBD (Fig. 3c, d).
In human SARS-CoV-2 infection it has been suggested that one pathological
mechanism is a loss of pericytes caused by viral infection reducing their viability or their
interactions with endothelial cells10. In a transgenic model of pericyte loss (decreasing
PDGFR signalling) it was found that endothelial cells upregulated von Willebrand Factor
(vWF) production, and thus produced a pro-thrombotic state, which could explain the
coagulopathy seen in SARS-CoV-2 patients10. However, exposing hamster brain slices to
RBD (0.7 mg/l) for 3 hours, in the absence or presence of 50 nM angiotensin II, had no
significant effect on pericyte death as assessed by propidium labelling (Fig. 4a).
Nevertheless, infection with the actual virus might have more profound effects on pericyte
function or viability than does exposure to the RBD.
Capillary constriction is potentiated by SARS-CoV-2 RBD in human capillaries
To assess whether the potentiation of capillary constriction, characterised above in
hamsters, also occurs in human capillaries, we employed brain slices made from live human
brain tissue that was removed in the course of tumour removal surgery14. Consistent with the
similar binding22 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and hamster ACE2, we found that the
RBD greatly potentiated the pericyte-mediated capillary constriction evoked by 50 nM
angiotensin II (Fig. 4b-c). SARS-CoV-2 binding would therefore be expected to decrease
human cerebral blood flow assuming that, as in rodents, the largest resistance to flow within
the brain parenchyma is provided by capillaries34.
Discussion
The data presented above are consistent with the scheme shown in Fig. 4d-e.
Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in pericytes leads to a decrease in ACE2 activity,
either as a result of ACE2 internalisation6,8 or due to occlusion of the angiotensin II binding
site. This leads to an increase in the local concentration of vasoconstricting angiotensin II
and a decrease in the concentration of vasodilating angiotensin-(1-7). The resulting

activation of contraction via AT1 receptors in capillary pericytes reduces capillary diameter
locally by ~12% when 50 nM angiotensin II is present. As most of the vascular resistance
within the brain is located in capillaries34, this could significantly reduce cerebral blood flow
(as occurs following pericyte-mediated constriction after stroke and in Alzheimer’s
disease13,14). Presumably the same mechanism could evoke a similar reduction of blood flow
in other organs where pericytes express ACE2 and AT1 receptors.
From our data it is complicated to predict the magnitude of blood flow reduction
expected. If a 12% diameter reduction occurred uniformly in the cerebral vasculature then,
by Poiseuille’s law for a pure liquid (flow proportional to the 4th power of diameter), the blood
flow would be reduced by 40% [from (1-0.12)4 = 0.6]. However pericytes occur only every
30-100 m (depending on age) along capillaries, suggesting a less profound effect on
vascular resistance. On the other hand, the fact that blood contains cells results in its
viscosity increasing dramatically at small diameters35, so that even small pericyte-mediated
constrictions can have a large effect. Indeed, complete stalling of blood flow in capillaries
can occur as a result of neutrophils (which are less distensible than red blood cells)
becoming stuck at narrow parts of the vessel, for example near constricted pericytes36-38,
and this could also transform a small constriction into a much larger reduction of blood flow.
In order for SARS-CoV-2 to evoke pericyte-mediated capillary constriction (or to
cause pericyte dysfunction that upregulates vWF production10) the virus would need to bind
to the ACE2 that is located in pericytes located on the opposite side of the endothelial cell
barrier from the blood. Access to pericytes in the brain parenchyma might occur via initial
infection of the nasal mucosa and movement from there up the olfactory nerve into the
brain39,40. Alternatively, movement of the S1 part of the Spike protein across the blood-brain
barrier by transcytosis has been reported41, and crossing the endothelial cell layer may also
occur via infection of monocytes (which express ACE2 highly42 and can cross endothelial
cells), or via breakdown of the blood-brain barrier as a result of cytokines released as a
result of lung inflammation43.

The reduction of blood flow produced by pericyte-mediated capillary constriction,
together with any upregulation of vWF that may occur10, will tend to promote clotting in the
microvasculature. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with thrombus formation44 in large
vessels that can be imaged, but it seems possible that thrombi of microvascular origin45 may
add to this, and could perhaps even seed these larger clots. Together, capillary constriction
and thrombus formation will reduce the energy supply to the brain and other organs,
initiating deleterious changes that probably contribute to the long duration symptoms46 of
“long Covid”. Indeed, the decrease of cerebral blood flow occurring during SARS-CoV-2
infection17 outlasts the acute symptoms47.
Our data suggest an obvious therapeutic approach, i.e. that the reduction of cerebral
and renal blood flow that is observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection17,18 might be blockable using

Methods
Animals Brain slices (200-300 m thick) were made from the brains of Syrian golden
hamsters (age 5-24 weeks) of both sexes, which were humanely killed (in accordance with
UK and EU law) by cervical dislocation after being anaesthetised with isoflurane. In each
slice only one pericyte was studied. The constriction evoked by angiotensin II in the
presence of the RBD showed overlapping ranges of value for 2 female vessels and 9 male
vessels (p=0.67).
Imaging of pericyte mediated constriction Pericytes on cortical capillaries were identified
visually as previously described (Fig. S1 of ref. 14) and imaged with a CCD camera as
described21. Diameter was measured in ImageJ by drawing a line across the vessel between
the inner walls of the endothelial cells.
RBD and mutant RBD synthesis Codon optimised Genblocks (IDT Technology) for the
receptor binding domain (RBD amino acids 330-532) of SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank MN908947)
and human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2, amino acids 19-615) were inserted
into the vector pOPINTTGneo (PMID: 25447866) incorporating a C-terminal BirA-His6 tag
and pOPINTTGneo-3C-Fc to make C-terminal fusions to Human IgG Fc. The RBD-Y489R
mutant was generated by firstly amplifying the RBD-WT gene using oligos TTGneo_RBD_F
and RBD-Y489R_R, as well as RBD-Y489R_F and TTGneo_RBD_R; followed by joining the
two resulted fragments with TTGneo_RBD_F and TTGneo_RBD_R.

Surface plasmon resonance Experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 system
(GE Healthcare). All assays were performed using a Sensor Chip Protein A (GE Healthcare),
with a running buffer of PBS pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.005% vol/vol surfactant P20 (GE
Healthcare), at 25 °C. ACE2-Fc was immobilized onto the sample flow cell of the sensor
chip; the reference flow cell was left blank. RBD-WT or RBD-Y489R (0.1 μM) was injected
over the two flow cells, at a flow rate of 30 μl min−1 with an association time of 60 s.
Solutions Brain slices were superfused at 33-36oC with solution containing (mM): 124 NaCl,
2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose and 0.1 ascorbate,
bubbled with 20% O2/70% N2/5% CO2 to ensure a physiological [O2] was achieved in the
slice13. The high molecular weight of the RBD (~31 kD) implies it will not diffuse rapidly from
the superfusion solution into brain slices so, to apply the RBD, we pre-incubated each slice
in solution containing RBD (at 35oC, to allow time for diffusion) prior to placing the slice in
the imaging chamber, where it was superfused with the same solution containing the RBD.
This 30 min pre-incubation time was mimicked for slices that RBD was not applied to. The
same procedure was followed for the mutant RBD.
Immunohistochemistry Hamster brain slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
while shaking at room temperature for 20 min and washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Antigen retrieval using sodium citrate buffer (consisting of 10 mM sodium
citrate, 0.05% Tween 20 and HCl to adjust the pH to 6.0) for 20 min was performed and the

slices were left to cool down for 20 min before being washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Brain
slices were transferred to blocking solution containing 10% horse serum, 0.2% saponin
(Sigma-Aldrich, S7900), 200 mM glycine and 150 μM bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4oC,
and shaken overnight. Slices were incubated in the blocking solution with primary antibodies
for 72 hours at 4oC with agitation, washed with PBS 4 times, incubated with the secondary
antibody overnight at 4°C with agitation and washed again 4 times with PBS. For nucleus
counter staining, slices were incubated in PBS containing DAPI (100 ng/ml) for 1 h at room
temperature and washed in PBS for 5 min. Primary antibodies used were goat anti-ACE2
(R&D systems, AF933, 1:200), mouse anti-NG2 (Abcam, ab50009, 1:200) and rabbit antiPDGFRβ (Santa Cruz, sc-432, 1:200). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa fluor 488
donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen, A11055, 1:500), Alexa fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen,
A31570, 1:500) and Alexa fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A31573, 1:500).
Pericyte death assessment Brain slices (300 m thick) were incubated for 3 h at 35oC in
extracellular solution (bubbled with 20% O2, 5% CO2 and 75% N2) containing 7.5 μM
propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, 81845) and isolectin B4 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647
(Invitrogen, I32450) 3.3 g/ml, with and without RBD (0.7 mg/l) and/or angiotensin II (50
nM). The slices were fixed with 4% PFA for 1 hour and washed 3 times with PBS, for 10
minutes each time. Nucleus counterstaining was achieved by incubating the slices in PBS
containing DAPI (100 ng/ml) for 1 hour, washing 1 time with PBS. Imaging of Z stacks
(approximately 320 m x 320 m x 20 m) was performed on a confocal microscope. The
first 20 μm from the surface were discarded to exclude cells killed by the slicing procedure.
Human tissue Live human cortical tissue was obtained from the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery (Queen Square, London). Cortical biopsies were taken from
female subjects aged 40–74 undergoing tumour resection. Healthy brain tissue overlying the
tumour, which would otherwise have been discarded, was used. Ethical approval was
obtained (REC number 15/NW/0568, IRAS ID 180727 (v3.0), “Properties of human

Fig. 1. Cerebral pericytes express ACE2 and constrict capillaries in response to Ang II
(a) Labelling of hamster cortical slice with antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, the
pericyte markers NG2 and PDGFR, and with DAPI to label nuclei (b) Lower magnification
maximum intensity projection of ACE2 and PDGFR labelling, showing capillaries and
penetrating arteriole. (c) Integrated ACE2 labelling overlapping with a binarised mask of
PDGFR labelling and with the inverse of this mask (numbers on bars are image stacks). (d)
Integrated ACE2 labelling over capillaries versus penetrating arterioles (PA). (e) Average
normalised diameter changes (mean±s.e.m.) at 5 pericytes in brain slices exposed to the
thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 (200 nM), and then with the neurotransmitter glutamate
(500 M) superimposed. (f) Average normalised diameter changes at 9 pericytes exposed to
150 nM angiotensin II alone (aCSF), and 10 pericytes exposed to angiotensin II in the
presence of the AT1R blocker losartan (20 M). (g) As in (f) (aCSF plot is the same) but
showing angiotensin II response in the presence of the AT2R blocker PD123319 (1 M) or
the Mas receptor blocker A779 (10 M). (h) Peak constriction evoked by angiotensin II in
different conditions (number of pericytes studied shown on bars).

Fig. 2. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD potentiates angiotensin-evoked capillary constriction
(a) Perfusion of brain slices with RBD (0.7 mg/l) has no significant effect on capillary
diameter at pericytes (mean±s.e.m.; n=5 for aCSF and 6 for RBD). (b) After preincubation in
aCSF for 30 mins, applying 2 M angiotensin II evokes a small transient capillary
constriction at pericytes (n=6), while including RBD (0.7 mg/l) in the solutions results in an
~5-fold larger response to angiotensin II (n=4; peak constriction plotted is slightly larger than
the mean value quoted in the text because the latter was averaged over 5 frames and here
only every 5th frame is plotted). (c) RBD has no effect on constriction evoked by 200 nM
U46619 (n=6 for aCSF and 5 for RBD). (d) Response to 50 nM angiotensin II after pre18

incubation and subsequent perfusion with aCSF, or aCSF containing RBD or Y489R mutant
RBD (n=9 for each). (e) Surface plasmon resonance responses for RBD and mutant
(Y489R) RBD binding to immobilised human ACE2. (f) Mean constriction between t = 29.67
and 30.00 min in (d).

Fig. 3. The effect of RBD is mimicked by blocking ACE2 and reduced by losartan
(a) Capillary constriction at pericytes in response to 50 nM angiotensin II in the absence
(n=9) and presence (n=9) of the RBD (mean±s.e.m., replotted from Fig. 2d) and in the
presence of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 (1 M, n=9). (b) Constriction in (a) between t =
29.67 and 30.00 min. (c) Response to 50 nM angiotensin II after 30 mins incubation in (and
continued perfusion with) aCSF containing RBD (0.7 mg/l, n=9, from Fig. 2d) or additionally
losartan (20 M, n=10). (d) Constriction in (c) between t = 29.67 and 30.00 min.

(a) Percentage of pericytes dead (assessed with propidium iodide) in hamster brain slices
(numbers on bars) after 3 hours incubation in aCSF, or aCSF containing 50 nM angiotensin
II and/or RBD (0.7 mg/l). (b) Effect of 50 nM angiotensin on capillary diameter (mean±s.e.m.)
at pericytes in human brain slices in the presence (n=4) and absence (n=5) of the RBD (30
mins pre-incubation). (c) Mean constriction at 30 mins) from data in (b). (d-e) Likely mode of
operation of RBD binding to ACE2. (d) Normally, angiotensin II (e.g. generated by the brain
renin-angiotensin system (RAS)) can act on vasoconstricting AT1 receptors or vasodilating
AT2 receptors, and is converted (pink arrow) by pericyte ACE2 to vasodilating angiotensin(1-7) that acts via Mas receptors. (e) In the presence of SARS-CoV-2, binding of the Spike
protein RBD to ACE2 leads to its internalisation (see Introduction), reducing the conversion
of angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin II (derived from the brain RAS or from the
peripheral RAS) will then evoke a different balance of responses via the receptors shown,
generating a larger constriction because of less activation of Mas receptors.
