Abstract
The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome which can be fatal, especially in elderly population, has been declared a pandemic
by the World Health Organization. Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The
viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor
ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on
the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of
the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD
with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex.
These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar/charged residues appear at the
interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the
SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and
ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV.
Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher
binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding
interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even
far from the binding interface. Our results on the molecular differences in the binding
between the two viruses can provide important inputs for development of appropriate
antiviral treatments of the new viruses, addressing the necessity of ongoing pandemics.

Introduction
The COVID-19 disease that has rapidly spread from the Chinese Wuhan city to the rest of
the world is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) named also the severe acute
respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 The sequencing of its genome revealed

that it is closely related to other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),
which have killed hundreds of people in the last two decades. 2,3
Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that carry on
their surface spike-like projections giving it a crown-like appearance under the electron microscope; hence the name coronavirus. 4 These spikes (S) enable the fusion between viral and
host membranes and are essential for the beginning of the enveloped virus infection. 5,6 They
are composed of a large ectodomain, a trans-membrane anchor and a short intracellular tail
(Fig. 1). The ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion
subunit S2 which are crucial for binding of the virus to the host cell surface and for entry
of the viral genomes into the target cell, respectively. 7–11 The S1 subunit is composed of
N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), which can both function
as the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), recognizing and binding to the host protein receptor. The cellular entry receptor for the SARS-CoV is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2). 12 The RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share significant sequence similarity,
therefore several research groups investigated if SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cellular entry
receptor. 2,13–16 And they all confirmed that this is indeed the case.
The ACE2 enzyme is a part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that
controls blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance, systemic vascular resistance, tissue
damage etc. 17 The primary physiological role of the ACE2 is to convert a peptide hormone
angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), that have protective role as they diminish the inflammation and fibrosis. 17,18 The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses bind to ACE2 preventing
the metabolism of the angiotensin II, which accumulates and can cause deleterious effects.
There are many controversial debates about the beneficial or harmful role of the RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. 18–22 Number of experts defend their beneficial role, but
the qualified clinical studies will have to be done to answer this important question. The
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related, nonetheless, significant differences were

reported for their protein structures, importantly the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
domain with respect to the SARS-CoV that can impact the binding affinity for the host
receptor. 14,23 In our study we aimed to compare the structural and energetic differences
in the binding of the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to the ACE2 receptor by
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The viral RBD represents one of the main possible
targets for the development of antiviral drugs, therefore, understanding the binding between
the viral RBD and ACE2 can be very useful for rational drug design. We exploited the fact
that different 3D protein structures of the ACE2 in complex with the RBD of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 are available in the Protein Data Bank: (i) SARS-CoV RBD in complex
with ACE2, PDB code: 2AJF 24 (ii) SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2, PDB code:
6VW1 25 (iii) SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2, PDB code: 6M0J. 26 By using two
SARS-CoV-2 samples and one SARS-CoV sample, we can effectively compare the variations among the viruses, as well as identify the important and unimportant mutations and
interactions.
Molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the characteristics of the binding mechanism between viral RBDs and its receptor. Sequence, structural and dynamical analyses
are carried out to identify similarities and differences between the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses
and the previous SARS-CoV virus. Our results provide a molecular understanding of the
binding complex and show that the new viruses bind more strongly to the receptor. Despite
variations between the sequences of the two SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the two samples of the new
viruses behave very similarly, and have similar binding properties for the human receptor.
By eliminating unimportant differences in the sequences of the new viruses, and comparing
them to the sequence of the old SARS-CoV virus, four important mutations between SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV are identified: Y to L455, VP to EI471-472, -PP to GVE482-484,
and Y to Q498 (the indices are that of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is shifted higher by 13
compared to SARS-CoV virus numbering). They are shown structurally to be at or close
to the binding interface with the receptor protein. The mutations lead to higher flexibility

of the backbones by substitution of Prolines and insertion of Glycine. The mutations also
reduce number of hydrophobic interactions at the interface since hydrophobic residues are
substituted with charged or polar residues. With higher backbone flexibility, new residues
can move closer to the receptor interface, increasing the number of non-bonded interactions
between the proteins. Specifically, the mutations eliminate one hydrogen bonding with the
receptor, but increase the coordination number (number of contacts) by 20%. This leads to
stronger non-bonded interactions (electrostatics and van der Waals) with the receptor compared to the SARS-CoV virus. The overall results suggest that the binding energy in the
new SARS-CoV-2 viruses is slightly higher relative to the SARS-CoV virus. This is in reasonable agreement with experimental results reporting that the new corona virus has 10-20
times higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor than the old SARS-CoV. 27 Structurally,
stronger binding is shown to not only stabilize the binding interface, but also to stabilize the
overall structural fold of the viral RBD of the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction in Section 1, the detail of the
computational procedure is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the results are presented
and discussed. We conclude in Section 4.

Materials and Methods
The RBD - ACE2 complexes were obtained from the RCSB PDB database with ID: 6VW1, 25
6M0J 26 for the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and 2AJF 24 for the SARS-CoV virus. For easy
identification, these systems are named 6VW1, 6M0J and 2AJF respectively. The 6VW1
and 2AJF systems contain two complexes, chains A and E, chains B and F. The 6M0J
contains only one complex, chains A and E. We keep only the complex of chain A (ACE2
receptor) with chain E (viral RBD) in these samples to better compare them to one another.
This is also understandable since the complex of chain B and F is a near 180◦ rotation
symmetry of the complex of chain A and E. It is an artifact of protein crystallization, not

actual arrangement of the complexes in real biological system.
There are some notable structural elements in these complexes that need special care
when setting up the simulation systems such as: the disulfide bonds between various pairs
of Cysteine residues; the N−linked glycosylations of various Asparagine residues; and the
ZnGlu2 His2 zinc−finger structure that needs proper protonation states of the associated
amino acids. 28 Details of these structural elements are listed in Table 1 for better identification in later discussion of the simulation results. .

created using CHARMM-GUI web-server 35 and then modified manually to properly describe
some of above structural elements. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations 36 are performed
on the systems using the GROMACS/2018.6 software package. 37 Charmm-36 force-field 38
was chosen for parametrization of the proteins and ions. GLYCAM06 force-field 39 was used
to parametrize the glycans and TIP3P 40 model is used for water in the explicit solvent simulation model. After solvation, sodium and chlorine ions are added to the system to neutralize
the total charges and to set physiological electrolyte concentration of solution at 150 mM
NaCl. The simulation box size was chosen so that the proteins in neighbor periodic box are
at least 3 nm apart from each other. Since the electrostatic screening length at 150mM NaCl
concentration is about 7Å, this 3 nm distance is more than enough to eliminate the finite
size effect due to long range electrostatic interactions among proteins in neighboring simulation boxes, yet small enough to keep the size of the system manageable with our current
computational resources. The total numbers of molecules, residues and atoms for the three
systems simulated are listed in Table 2: The temperature of 310 K and the pressure of 1 atm

Results and discussions
Preliminary sequence and structural analyses
Before going into detailed discussion of simulation results, let us analyse the sequences and
structures of the three RBD−ACE2 complexes of the experimental samples, 2AJF for SARSCoV virus, 6VW1 and 6M0J for SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This helps to clarify common features
as well as differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This information will
be valuable for later interpretation and discussion of results of our MD simulations.
The human ACE2 receptor
In the experimental X−ray crystal structures of 2AJF, 24 6VW1 25 and 6M0J, 26 sequences
of the human ACE2 receptor are identical but glycosylations of the human ACE2 protein in
these complexes show some small variations (see Table 1). For the 2AJF sample, the N-link
glycosylations occur at the four Asparagine residues, N53, N90, N322, and N546. They link
to chains of two or three N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine (NAG) and may end with β-D-Mannose
(BMA) molecules. For the 6VW1 sample, the same residues are also N-link glycosylated,
albeit with slightly different length of the oligosacharides. Additionally, residue N103 is also

glycosylated with a single NAG residue. For the 6M0J sample, all three Asparagine residues,
N90, N322, and N546 are N−link glycosylated with a single NAG sugar molecule.
The N−link glycosylation plays an important role in the protein structure stability. Despite different number of glycosylated sites in studied ACE2 proteins, we will see later in
our MD simulation results that the three ACE2 proteins have nearly identical structural
and dynamical properties in low energy modes. Only the 6M0J sample with less glycosylation degrees shows some differences at localized high energy dynamical modes, but these
differences do not influence the binding interface of the viral RBD and the ACE2 receptor.
The viral receptor-binding domain

Figure 2: Sequence alignments of the viral RBD of two SARS-CoV-2 stuctures (6M0J and
6VW1) and the SARS-CoV structure (2AJF). The *, :, or . notations below the sequence
denote a fully, strongly, or weaker conserved mutation respectively. A blank space below
the sequences means a non-conserved mutation. Different mutations emerge between the
compared RBDs, but four groups of mutations (highlighted in yellow) show aminoacids fully
conserved between SARS-CoV-2 samples and non-conserved in the SARS-CoV sequence (see
text for more discussion). The grayed−out residues at the end of the sequences are flexible
N- and C- termini loops that are missing in the PDB crystal structure.
Unlike the human receptor, the sequences of viruses’ receptor-binding domain (RBD) of
the coronaviruses in all three structures, 2AJF, 6VW1 and 6M0J are different to varying
degrees of conservations. In Fig. 2, these three sequences of the viral RBD are aligned using
ClustalW web-server. 29 The sequence identity between the two SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses
is 85%. The sequence identity between SARS-CoV (2AJF) with two SARS-CoV-2 samples
(6M0J and 6VW1) are 72% and 85%, respectively. Thus, these RBD of coronaviruses are
very similar in sequence and structure. This is expected because they are closely related in

the coronavirus family.
Since we are looking for major differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we only
look for aminoacids that are the same in the two SARS-CoV-2 viruses but are not-conserved
with respect to SARS-CoV virus. Using these criteria, we identify four locations of important
mutations. These are highlighted in yellow in Fig. 2. Remarkably, upon spatial inspection,
all these four locations are at or close to the binding interface with the human ACE2 receptor.
This is a strong hint that these mutations can be critical for the stronger receptor binding
of the new viruses. We will focus more on these mutations in later discussions of results of
MD analyses.
Before discussing the MD results, a quick scan on the physical changes at some of these
mutations can already be made:
• Y to L455: this mutation in SARS-CoV-2 leads to the loss of the aromatic ring and
especially the hydroxyl group of Tyrosine amino acid. So it removes the possibility for
hydrogen bond with the receptor counterpart residue Glu35. In MD analyses, we will
see that the loss of hydrogen bond binding at this location is compensated with other
non-bonded interactions.
• VP mutated to EI at index 471-472 of SARS-CoV-2: this mutation substitutes the
rigid Proline residue and adds the negatively charged Glutamic Acid E471. This increases the flexibility of the protein backbone.
• -PP to GVE at index 482-484 of SARS-CoV-2: The insertion of Glycine and the
substitutions of two Proline amino acids clearly make this segment much more flexible. This flexibility allows the segment to move closer to its receptor and enables the
negatively charged E484 residue to form electrostatic bond with the positively charged
residue K31 of the human ACE2 receptor.
• Y to Q498 mutation in SARS-CoV-2 turns the T-stacking hydrophobic interaction
between the two tyrosines at the RBD-ACE2 interface into electrostatic interactions

with the opposing Q42 residue of the ACE2 receptor.
In summary, these mutations increase the flexibility of the backbone atoms at the viral
binding interface and they add to this interface polar or charged residues. Higher flexibility
allows them to adapt better to the receptor binding interface, increasing the number of
contacts between the two proteins. The increase in the non-bonded electrostatic and van der
Waals interactions then leads to higher binding affinity as found later by MD simulation.

Residues at N- and C-termini of SARS-CoV-2 viral RBD
Fig. 2 shows, the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2 samples have some additional residues at the Nand C-termini compared to the SARS-CoV sample. However, Fig. 3 shows that these RBD
residues are located far away from the binding interface with the human ACE2 receptor.
Because our main goal is to discern the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
receptor binding, whenever appropriate when aligning the structures for analyses, we use
only the common “core” part of the three viral RBD proteins (from amino acid sequence
CPFGE to VLSFE in Fig. 2).
Other differences among the viral RBD structures are the missing residues at the N- and
C-termini. In Fig. 2, the grayed−out residues at the two ends of SARS-CoV-2 sequences are
missing in the protein experimental crystal structures since the precise 3D structures of the
termini loops cannot be determined by crystallography because of their flexibility. To find out
if these residues may play an important role for the stability of the structure, we simulate
two different 6VW1 systems, the first with original PDB structure and the second where
the missing termini residues are added to the PDB structure by homology modelling. 32–34
Both systems are simulated for 200 ns and statistics are collected from 50 ns onward. By
comparing to the systems with and without added missing residues, we see no noticeable
differences in the structures of the binding interface. In Fig. 4, the mean fluctuations of
Cα atoms in the core region of the viral RBD are plotted for the systems with or without
terminal residues added (blue and red curves, respectively). As one can see, the difference

Quantities such as radius of gyrations, moment of inertia along principle axes of systems
with and without missing residues also show identical values within standard uncertainty
as shown in Table 3. Thus, one can conclude that adding missing terminal residues does
not alter significantly the structure of the core binding region of the viral RBD. On the
other hand, since these flexible and disordered terminal loops extend far into the aqueous
solution, they significantly increase the size of the simulation box. As a result from these
considerations, for the rest of this work, we simulate only the residues present in the crystal
structure without the missing residues at the termini to save computational resources.
The ACE2 protein of the 6VW1 system misses a D615 residue at the C−terminal compared to the ACE2 protein in the 2AJF and 6M0J systems. Since this is just one residue,
costing minimal computing resource, we add this missing residue in the simulated systems.
The three systems simulated thus have identical ACE2 protein sequences. Most of the differences are due to changes in the viral RBD sequences.

Deviations and fluctuations of the structural backbone atoms
Let us now present and discuss the results of our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the
three systems and compare the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 samples.

As a standard procedure, one first looks at the deviations of the structural proteins from
their native experimental structures. In Fig. 5, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of
backbone atoms in the three systems are plotted as function of time. Fig. 5(a) is plotted for
the human ACE2 receptor, while Fig. 5(b) is plotted for the viral RBD protein. The viral
RBD, being smaller (∼ 200 residues) shows faster saturation time (at around 50ns) than
the ACE2 receptor (∼ 600 residues) whose saturation time is at around 100 ns or longer.
Among SARS-CoV versus SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the viral RBD is remarkably more stable in
the new viruses as they both deviate only 1.5Å from the native structure while that of the
old SARS-CoV virus shows about 3Å deviation. Similarly to the RBD, the human ACE2 in
the SARS-CoV-2 systems are more stable and show lower RMSD values than in the SARSCoV complex. The ACE2 receptor in 2AJF system also indicates longer relaxation time.
Nevertheless, both proteins in all systems are stable with RSMD less than 4Å deviation from
native structure. As a result of this RMSD analysis, in all subsequent equilibirium statistical
analyses, the first 100 ns of the MD trajectories will be dropped.
Next, let us look at the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the atoms. This
fluctuation is due to thermal effect of finite temperature (at 310 K) compared to the low
temperature of experimental crystallized structure where proteins are frozen. It is a good
measurement of the backbone stability of the proteins. In Fig. 6(a), RMSF of the backbone
Cα atoms of the human ACE2 receptor in the three systems are plotted for individual
residues. One can see from this figure that this receptor behaves similarly across the three
systems, with variations less than 0.5Å from one system to another. Our MD simulations
show as well that the different ACE2 glycosylation states (see Table 1 for more details) have
minimal influence on the rigidity of the protein backbones. One noteworthy difference is the
slightly higher fluctuations of ACE2 residues 134-177, 262-278, 489-500 in the 6M0J system
compared to the other two. As it turns out, these residues surround a Cl− ion in the 2AJF
and 6VW1 systems (see Fig. 6(b)). For unknown reasons, this chlorine ion is absent in the
experimental crystal structure of 6M0J system. These residues are at the other extreme of

fluctuations in this region have no important consequences.

Figure 6: Root-mean-square fluctuations of the backbone Cα atoms of the human ACE2
receptor as function of the residues along the protein backbone (a) for different viruses.
Although very similar to each other, the 6M0J system shows slightly higher fluctuations at
certain ranges of residues. Figure (b) show these residue ranges in blue color. They are all
located near a Cl− ion (shown in green). See text for more details.
The RMSF for the viral RBD core region is plotted in Fig. 7. Here, instead of following
exact residue order, the residue indices are shifted and aligned according to the alignment
table shown in Fig. 2. This is done so that similar amino acids of the two viruses are
compared to each other. One can see from this figure that despite variations in the exact
sequences of the two SARS-CoV-2 samples, they behave very similarly to each other (the
blue and green curves). Both of them are more stable, with less thermal fluctuations than
the SARS-CoV virus (the red curve). The downward arrows in this figure show the locations
of the four mutations highlighted in Fig. 2. The mutation, -PP to GVE, leads to the strongest,
most notable difference between the two viruses, with the new coronavirus showing much
less fluctuations. This is in line with our earlier suggestion that insertion of Glycine and
substitution of rigid Proline make the backbone more flexible, allowing it to move closer to
the receptor and to bind tighter to it.
Remarkably, Figure 7 also shows that, at the N-terminal part, around the indices 340,

365, and 390, the SARS-CoV sample is much less stable than the two SARS-CoV-2 samples.
Close inspection of the secondary structure in this region (not shown) show that the various
β−sheets here are longer in SARS-CoV-2 viruses than those of SARS-CoV virus, indicating
a more ordered and compact structure. Stronger receptor binding seems to stabilize not
only the ACE2-RBD binding interface (see the next Section), but also the overall structure
of viral RBD of the new viruses.

Hydrogen bonding and coordination number between the viral RBD
and the human ACE2 receptor
After performing several sequence and structural investigations, let us move to the interaction
picture among amino acids at the binding interface of the viral RBD and its human ACE2
receptor. In Fig. 8(a), the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonds between the viral

virus sample. When plotting (not shown) the hydrogen bond distribution for the specific
mutated residues highlighted in Fig. 2, it is observed that the first mutation from Tyrosine
to Leucine turns off hydrogen bonds at this location due to the lack of side chain hydroxyl
(−OH) group in Leucine as expected.
It should be noted that the number of hydrogen bonds can only be accurately determined
from a full quantum mechanical calculation. However, such calculations are beyond our
computing capacity for such a large system. Here, simple geometric criteria are used to
determine the hydrogen bonding, namely the distance between the donor and acceptor atoms
is less than 3.5 Å, and the angle of the three atoms making up the hydrogen bond is less
than 30◦ . This may overestimate the total number of hydrogen bonds since one atom can
participate in more hydrogen bonds at once. Nevertheless, even with this classical definition,
the loss of one hydrogen bond due to this mutation is quite clear in our figure.
In addition, in Fig. 8(b), the coordination number between the Cα atoms of the viral
RBD and its receptor is plotted for the three systems in order to estimate the number of
interactions between the studied RBDs and ACE2 receptor. Here, the PLUMED driver
version 2.5.1 43 is used for the calculation, for which the default contact function for a pairs
of atoms i and j is given by:
sij =

1 − (rij /r0 )n
.
1 − (rij /r0 )m

(1)

Here, rij is the distance between the atoms, r0 is the neighbor cutoff distance (set to 8Å
in our calculation), n = 6, and m = 12. The meaning of the contact function is similar to
inverted step function: when rij < r0 , sij ' 1, when rij > r0 , sij ' 0. Therefore, the contact
function denotes whether the two atoms i and j are within distance r0 from each other. The
expression, Eq. (1), makes the contact function analytically smooth at r0 .
By summing of the contact function over all possible pairs of Cα atoms, each from different
protein, one gets the coordination number which is a measurement of the number of Cα atoms
of one protein within r0 distance from those of the other proteins. In other words, it is a
good indicator of the neighbour interacting residue pairs between the proteins which covers

also non-bonded interactions such as van der Waals, electrostatics or hydrophobic excludedvolume interactions. As one can see clearly from Fig. 8(b), although variations between
6M0J and 6VW1 lead to different ranges of the coordination numbers, the values of the
most probable coordination number are the same for the two samples and both are greater
than the most probable coordination number for SARS-CoV virus. Thus, despite losing the
hydrogen bond related to Y to L455 mutation, the coordination number (number of contacts)
between the proteins increases by 20% in the case of the two SARS-CoV-2 samples, 6M0J
and 6VW1. This is more than enough to compensate for the loss of hydrogen bonding, and
increases the binding of viral RBD to the receptor for the new viruses.
It is interesting to see that variations in the sequences of 6VW1 and 6M0J samples of the
new SARS-CoV-2 viruses only lead to differences in the variance (or the width) of the distribution of the coordination number and/or the number of hydrogen bonds. Specifically, the
6M0J sample shows significant probability for low coordination number and also lower number of hydrogen bonds, perhaps lower binding energy compared to 6VW1 sample. However,
these variations do not change the most probable values of the distributions. This suggests
that sequence variations in these two SARS-CoV-2 virus samples are not too important for
the receptor binding, while the sequence variations from 2AJF SARS-CoV viruses matters
more. This fact is similar to many analyses done so far that the two new SARS-CoV-2
viruses behave very much alike each other, and both are different from SARS-CoV virus
behavior. This justifies our criteria for selection of the four regions of important mutations
as highlighted in Fig. 2.

Principal component analysis and the free energy landscape in collective variables
Principal component analysis is a useful method to analyze dynamics of proteins. 44 By
calculating the covariance matrix among the atoms, and diagonalize the resultant matrix we
obtain eigenvectors of dynamical motions of the protein (similar to the concept of normal

modes). This analysis is very helpful for biomolecules since the long−time dynamics will be
dominated by only a few lowest energy modes. All the strong oscillatory high energy modes
are screened out efficiently using this analysis, leading to a huge reduction in dimensionality of
the systems. By our own inspection, three lowest modes are enough to show distinct clusters
of configurations for the viral RBD. In Table 4, various information about the dynamics of

the proteins using PCA method are listed. Here, the Pmax (ai , aj ) is the maximum probability
density in the plane of the projections (ai , aj ) on the principal eigenvectors i-th and j-th
respectively. The trace of the covariance matrix is a measure of the overall flexibility of the
proteins. As one can see from this table, the trace for ACE2 for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 6VW1 are large and similar to each other. This is expected, since the human ACE2
receptor is a big protein, with same sequence and almost identical native structures in these
systems. The ACE2 protein of SARS-CoV-2 6M0J sample shows even a higher value. This
may be related to the missing Cl− ion in the experimental structure, and less degrees of
glycosylations of ACE2 protein in this sample (see the preliminary Section).
The difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are apparent from the PCA
information for the viral RBD domain. Here, the SARS-CoV 2AJF shows much larger trace
of 1.8 nm2 while both SARS-CoV-2 samples shows a trace of only 1.2 nm2 . This is again in
line with previous analyses that SARS-CoV-2 viral RBD are more stable.

of the protein in the phase space spanned by these collective variables. Differences in the
probability density for the viral RBD are once again significant. The SARS-CoV-2 virus
systems show two smooth, Gaussian-like clusters, while that of SARS-CoV shows weak and
scattered profiles. The maximum probability densities in Fig. 9 together with projection on
the third eigenvector are listed in Table 4 for both ACE2 and viral RBD backbone structures.
Using the relation, ∆G ∼ −kB T ln p, these result suggest that the depth of the free energy
landscape of RBD for the SARS-CoV-2 viruses is lower by kB T ln(pSARS2
/pSARS
max
max ) = 0.5 ± 0.1
kcal/mol. Clearly, the lower fluctuations of the backbone of the viral RBD in the SARS-CoV2 viruses that we showed in earlier analyses correlate with this lowering in the configurational
free energy of the RBD backbone. If one were to contribute this more stable structure
due to a stronger binding free energy to the ACE2 receptor, a heuristic estimate for the
latter should be about 2-4 times the entropic change, based on the typical balance between
interaction energy and entropic configurational freedom for protein-protein complexes. 45 Our
heuristic estimate thus gives a binding free energy difference, ∆∆G of about −1 to −2.5
kcal/mol stronger for the new viruses. Experimentally, it is shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus
has 10-20 times higher binding affinity to the receptor than SARS-CoV virus. 27 Using the
relation ∆G = kB T ln Kd , a 10 to 20-fold increase in binding affinity corresponds to ∆∆G
in the range of −kB T ln 10 to −kB T ln 20, or about −1.5 to −2.0 kcal/mol. Thus, our
heuristic, hand-waving estimate for the binding free energy difference agrees reasonably
with this experimental range. One certainly requests a more comprehensive calculation of
binding free energy to give more quantitative predictions. However, many traditional semiempirical methods for quick estimation of free energy which work decently for ligand-protein
system fail for protein-protein system because of the large uncertainty related to the huge
configurational space of the later. One needs to resort to using various enhanced sampling
methods such as metadynamics, 46,47 umbrella sampling, 48 or steered molecular dynamics
coupled with Jarzynski’s equation. 49 Different forcefield parametrizations can also lead to
variations in this estimate. However, these investigations are extremely resource expensive

and are beyond the scope of this work. Here, by many different sequence, structural and
dynamical analyses, we have shown that the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses have stronger binding
affinity for the human ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV virus.

Conclusions
In this paper, we present a MD study of the viral receptor-binding domains from SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses in complex with the human ACE2 receptor. By using various
sequence, structural and energetic analyses, it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 viruses bind
stronger to its receptor than the SARS-CoV virus. The stronger binding not only creates
more stable binding interface, it can also causea more ordered structure of the viral RBD in
SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Despite very similar sequence identities, four important mutations in the new viruses play
important role in this stronger binding process, namely Y to L455, VP to EI471-472, -PP to
GVE482-484, and Y to Q498 (the indices are that of SARS-CoV-2 virus). These mutations
all lead to a reduced internal rigidity of the viral protein backbone near its binding interface
and add polar and charged residues to the interface. The higher flexibility in the backbone
of the new viruses then allows it to move closer to the human receptor protein surface, and
to bind stronger to the receptor using non-bonded interactions. Overall, the coordination
number between the proteins increases by 20% in the cases of the new SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
This increase in different non-bonded interactions (electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic)
overcome the loss of one hydrogen bond between the proteins, leading to a stronger binding
free energy.
There are some variations in the primary sequences of the two samples of SARS-CoV-2
viruses, with about 85% identity. However, our results show that these variations do not lead
to significant differences in the physical properties of the binding complex. Both samples
of the new viruses show very similar behaviours. These mutations are therefore non critical

for the binding process. Only the non-conserved mutation differences with SARS-CoV are
important.
Preliminary estimate of the binding free energy agrees reasonably with the experimental
data that SARS-CoV-2 viruses show 10 to 20 folds higher binding affinity for ACE2 receptor
as compared to SARS-CoV virus. A more thorough sampling method such as metadynamics,
umbrella sampling or steered molecular dynamics is requested for more quantitative comparison. Similarly, the presence of several other mutations in the sequence of new viruses,
its variations, stability/conservation are other interesting aspects that needs more thorough
investigations. However, all these studies go beyond the current scope of this paper and
will be presented in a near future work. Within this work, our sequence, structural and
dynamical analyses have provided strong support that SARS-CoV-2 viruses bind stronger
to the human ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV virus.
Our molecular description of the virus-receptor binding interface, particularly the insight
we obtained in the role of mutations, can help in the development of vaccines and antiviral
drugs by rational drug design addressing the important needs in ongoing pandemics.
