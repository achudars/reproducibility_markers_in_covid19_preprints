Abstract

17

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December

18

2019 and has quickly become a worldwide pandemic. In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have

19

developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency

20

Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion

21

SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima) and the BioFire Diagnostics

22

COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance, as well as workflow. All three

23

assays showed a similar limit of detection (LOD) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection ranging from

24

500-1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same

25

trend, but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification

26

of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive

27

percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7% when compared to the

28

consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of

29

discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had Ct values >37 on the

30

Fusion assay.

31

In conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in

32

absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed. In addition, the Fusion and BioFire assays

33

showed better clinical performance, while the Aptima assay showed a modest decrease in overall PPA.

34

These findings should be kept in mind when making platform testing decisions.

Introduction:

38

The novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States in Washington State on January 20,

39

2020 (1), and by March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the severe acute

40

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak as a worldwide pandemic (2). Since then SARS-

41

CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the country. At the time of this report, the number of cases in the U.S.

42

has almost reached 1.4 million, and the number of deaths has exceeded 84,000 according to the Johns

43

Hopkins University database (3). Certain regions and cities have much higher prevalence than others,

44

especially the New York metropolitan area that our laboratories serve. New York City alone accounts for

45

approximately 14% of the cases in the United States (3).

46

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which symptoms

47

can vary from mild (e.g., fever, fatigue, dry cough) to severe illness (e.g., dyspnea, persistent pain or

48

pressure in the chest, hypoxia, confusion), and can ultimately lead to death, particularly for those ≥65

49

years of age and those with certain underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, or

50

diabetes (4). Even more challenging, some are infected with the virus but do not display any signs or

51

symptoms of illness, which likely has contributed to the high rate of transmission (R0 = 2.0-2.5) among

52

humans (5).

53

Accurate and sensitive viral detection methods are key to quickly diagnose infections and mitigate

54

transmission. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly sensitive and specific methods for the

55

detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. The majority of the SARS-CoV-2 NAAT tests

56

available today are based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods,

57

including the BioFire Diagnostics COVID-19 test (BioFire) and the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay

58

(Fusion) evaluated in the present study. Clinical comparative data have been obtained for the Fusion assay

59

(6, 7, 8, 9), but to our knowledge there have been no comparative studies of the BioFire assay. Recently,

60

Hologic has developed a second NAAT, the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima), which has been submitted

61

to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA); this NAAT is based on

62

target capture and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) technologies and is run on the Panther

63

instrument. Like the BioFire assay, comparative evaluations have yet to be performed for this new

64

molecular assay.

65

An increase in testing capability is critically needed to manage the current testing demands, and

66

to monitor and control the spread of the virus going forward. While the FDA has worked quickly to review

67

and authorize more molecular diagnostic platforms to make more options available to meet demand, real

68

world clinical performance and comparative data are still lacking. These data are urgently needed to

69

better understand the benefits and limitations of each test, and how best to incorporate them into local

70

and national testing strategies.

71
72

Here we present an analytical and clinical evaluation of these three sample-to-answer NAATs for
the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic patients: Fusion, Panther, and BioFire.

Materials and Methods

74

Specimen collection and storage. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were obtained from patients with clinical

75

signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Each collection used a sterile swab made from Dacron, rayon or nylon which

76

was placed into sterile 3 ml universal transport medium (UTM- various manufacturers) after collection.

77

Samples were then transported at room temperature and were stored at 2-8⁰C for up to 72 hours and

78

tested as soon as possible after collection. For the retrospective sample set, after routine patient testing,

79

aliquots of samples were taken and stored at -80⁰C until testing of the three comparator NAATs could

80

occur.

81
82

Study design

83

Samples were selected from specimens received for routine SARS-CoV-2 testing between April and May

84

of 2020. The selection included symptomatic patients of all genders and ages. A total of 150

85

nasopharyngeal (NP) samples (75 negative and 75 positive) were used for this study: 101 retrospective

86

specimens (51 negative, 50 positive) and 49 prospective, fresh specimens (24 negative, 25 positive).

87

Specimens were selected to represent our laboratory’s positivity rate at the time this study was designed

88

(50 - 60% at beginning of April 2020) and also included positive specimens spanning the range of positivity,

89

including those with low viral loads (characterized by high cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by results

90

from initial clinical testing). The 101 retrospective specimens were initially tested per routine patient care

91

and then immediately aliquoted and frozen at -80⁰C, remaining frozen until this study was performed.

92

Retrospective sample aliquots were thawed and immediately tested on the Fusion, Aptima, and BioFire

93

systems. Testing for prospective samples was performed within 48 hours of collection. Prospective

94

samples were run on the Fusion, Aptima and BioFire using the original UTM sample and aliquoted directly

95

into Hologic Lysis tubes and into BioFire Sample Injection Vial. This work was conducted as a quality

96

improvement activity in order to complete assay validation for the Aptima and BioFire assays.

Hologic Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion). The Fusion assay (Hologic, Inc., San Diego, CA) was

99

performed on the Panther Fusion instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. This

100

assay targets two unique regions of the ORF1ab section of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. A 500 µL aliquot

101

of the primary NP swab specimen is transferred into a Specimen Lysis Tube containing 710 µL lysis buffer

102

and is then loaded onto the Panther Fusion instrument. From this tube, the instrument removes 360 µl

103

for extraction. Each specimen is processed with an internal control (IC), which is added via the working

104

Panther Fusion Capture Reagent-S. Nucleic acid is purified using capture oligonucleotides and a magnetic

105

field, eluted in 50 µl, and 5 µl of the eluted nucleic acid is added to a Panther Fusion reaction tube. The

106

Fusion assay amplifies and detects two conserved regions of the ORF1ab section of the SARS-CoV-2 viral

107

genome. Both amplicons are detected by probes using the same fluorescent reporter, with amplification

108

of either or both regions contributing to a single fluorescent signal and single Ct value. Reporting of a

109

positive specimen requires only one of the two targets to be detected (ORF1ab region 1 or ORF1ab region

110

2).

111
112

Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima). The Aptima assay (Hologic, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a NAAT

113

that uses target capture and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) technologies for the isolation

114

and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This assay targets two unique regions of the ORF1ab section of the

115

SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and is performed on the Panther instrument. All testing was performed

116

according to the manufacturer’s instructions and is briefly described. A 500 µL aliquot of the primary NP

117

swab specimen is transferred into a Specimen Lysis Tube containing 710 µL lysis buffer and this tube is

118

then loaded on to the Panther instrument. From the Specimen Lysis Tube, 360 µl is taken for each reaction.

119

Each specimen is processed with an IC, which is added via the working Target Capture Reagent. Nucleic

120

acid is purified using capture oligonucleotides and a magnetic field, and the purified nucleic acid used as

121

template for the TMA reaction. After amplification, chemiluminescent probes hybridize to amplicons and

122

emit light measured by a luminometer in relative light units (RLUs). The IC signal and SARS-CoV-2-specific

123

signal are differentiated by kinetic profiles of the labeled probes (rapid vs slow). Assay results are

124

determined by a cut-off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.

125
126

BioFire COVID-19 Test (BioFire). The BioFire COVID-19 Test (Salt Lake City, UT) was performed on the

127

BioFire FilmArray 12 Bay Torch System as per the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay targets two

128

unique regions of the ORF1ab section and one unique region of the ORF8 section of the SARS-CoV-2 viral

129

genome. The test pouch (1 per sample to be tested) is prepared by injecting Hydration Solution into the

130

pouch hydration port. Approximately 300 µl of sample is added with a provided transfer pipette to the

131

Sample Injection Vial, followed by the addition of a single-use Sample Buffer Tube to the Sample Injection

132

Vial and inverted to mix. The sample mix is injected into the pouch sample port. Within the pouch, the

133

sample is lysed by agitation (bead beating), and all nucleic acid is extracted and purified using magnetic

134

bead technology. Nested multiplex PCR is performed and endpoint melting curve data is used to detect

135

and generate a result for each target assay on the BioFire COVID-19 Test.

136
137

Analytical Sensitivity. Limit of detection (LOD) was performed using quantified inactivated (gamma-

138

irradiated) SARS-CoV-2 material from Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52287, BEI Resources, Manassas, VA)

139

and SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA quantified control containing five gene targets (E, N, ORF1ab, RdRP and S

140

Genes of SARS-CoV-2) from Exact Diagnostics (SKU COV019, Fort Worth, TX). The BEI material was

141

provided at 4.1 x 10^9 genome equivalents (GE)/ml (2.8 x 10^5 TCID50/ml pre-inactivation of virus)

142

concentration, from which the following serial dilutions were prepared (in GE/ml): 1,000, 500, 250, 125,

143

62.5, 31.3. Dilutions were prepared using Ambion® RNA Storage Solution (Catalog No. AM7001,

144

ThermoFisher Scientific) to limit the potential of degradation of the RNA, and aliquoted (with replicates

145

ranging from 5-10, as shown in Table 1) for testing across the different platforms. The same process was

146

followed for the Exact Diagnostics control, which had starting concentration of 200,000 copies/ml and

147

was diluted to make the same concentration of serial dilutions as those performed for the BEI material.

148

LOD was defined as the lowest dilution at which all replicates were positive (100% detection rate).

149
150

Workflow Evaluation. Workflow was evaluated using a calibrated timer to measure the time needed for

151

each step being evaluated, including hands-on time (HoT), assay run time and total turnaround time (TAT).

152

HoT, assay run time, and TAT were calculated using the throughput of samples per run.

153
154

Statistical methods. The consensus result was based on the majority results of the 3 NAATs (Fusion,

155

Aptima, BioFire) and was defined as follows: consensus positive = positive result in ≥2 of 3 NAATs;

156

consensus negative = negative result in ≥2 of 3 NAATs. The final result of each NAAT was based on each

157

manufacturer’s results interpretation algorithm. Percent positive agreement (PPA), percent negative

158

agreement (NPA), positivity rate, Kappa, and two-sided (upper/lower) 95% confidence interval (CI) were

159

calculated using Microsoft® Office Excel 365 MSO software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). As a measure of

160

overall agreement, Cohen's kappa values (κ) were calculated, with values categorized as follows: >0.90 =

161

almost-perfect, 0.90 to 0.80 = strong, 0.79 to 0.60 = moderate, 0.59 to 0.40 = weak, 0.39 to 0.21 = minimal,

162

0.20 to 0 = none (10, 11).

Results

164
165

Analytical Sensitivity.

166

Both quantified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI Resources) and Exact Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2

167

synthetic RNA quantified control were used to prepare serial dilution panels (1,000 to 31.3 [GE or

168

copies]/ml, in 2-fold dilutions) to determine the LOD of each assay. The LOD was defined as the lowest

169

dilution in which all replicates were detected (100% positivity rate), using the results interpretation

170

algorithm per the instructions for use for each assay. Using these criteria, the LOD using inactivated SARS-

171

CoV-2 virus was 1,000 GE/ml for the Fusion assay, 500 GE/ml for the Aptima assay, and 500 GE/ml for the

172

BioFire test (Table 1). In addition, the LOD as determined using the Exact Diagnostics synthetic RNA

173

transcript was 62.5 copies/ml for both the Fusion and Aptima and 125 copies/ml for the BioFire.

174
175

Clinical performance.

176

After testing of the 150 clinical specimens on all 3 platforms, consensus results were determined

177

for each sample (consensus positive = positive result in ≥2 of 3 NAATs; consensus negative = negative

178

result in ≥2 of 3 NAATs) and results from each NAAT were compared to the consensus result. The Fusion

179

and BioFire tests exhibited the highest positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, while the Aptima assay

180

had a PPA of 94.7% (Table 2). NPAs were 100% for all three NAATs, with no false positive results for any

181

platform. Cohen’s kappa values were 0.987, 0.947, and 0.987 for the Fusion, Aptima and BioFire tests,

182

respectively, all of which indicate an “almost perfect” level of agreement with the consensus result.

183

Initial equivocal or invalid results occurred for 3 samples out of the sample set: 2 equivocal results

184

for the BioFire test and 1 invalid result for the Fusion assay. The initial BioFire results for the 2 samples

185

were one of three targets detected (one of the ORF1ab targets); repeat testing gave the same result for

186

both samples, for an overall interpretation of “detected” as per the manufacturer. The initial Fusion

187

invalid result repeated as invalid and this sample was removed from the overall agreement analysis for

188

the Fusion assay; as this sample was negative by both Aptima and BioFire giving a consensus negative

189

result, this sample was kept in the overall agreement analyses for Aptima and BioFire.

190

There were no discordant results among the prospective, fresh sample set; all of the discordant

191

samples occurred among the retrospective sample set. Of the three NAATs evaluated, the Aptima assay

192

had the most discordant results with the consensus (n=4), followed by the Fusion and BioFire tests each

193

with one discordant result. Discordant sample results are shown in Table 3. The four discordant samples

194

for Aptima had Fusion Ct values ≥37.3, indicating lower viral titers in these samples. The discordant BioFire

195

sample had a Fusion Ct value of 35.7. For the 5 Fusion/Aptima discordant samples, the BioFire COVID-19

196

Test detected only 2 of 3 targets in each sample (GSD-3, GSD-6, GSD-23) or detected 1 of 3 targets in each

197

sample twice for an overall result of detected (GSD-4, GSD-48) (Table 3).

198
199

Workflow.

200

Workflow parameters along with basic assay characteristics are presented in Table 4. Maximum

201

sample throughput in 8 hour and 24 hour time periods were considerably higher on the Fusion and Aptima

202

platforms (Panther Fusion: 335/8 hours and 1150/24 hours; Panther Aptima: 275/8 hour and 1020/24

203

hours), while throughput for BioFire was 72/ 8 hour and 216/ 24 hours. Hands on time (HoT) per specimen

204

for the both Fusion and Aptima assays are 1 minute, where the BioFire HoT is 3 minutes per specimen.

205

Sample preparation for the Fusion and Aptima assays consist of aliquoting 500 µL of sample into a lysis

206

tube. Sample preparation for the BioFire consists of five steps including pouch hydration, sample and

207

buffer mixing, addition of sample/buffer to the pouch, and loading onto the instrument. These additional

208

step for BioFire account for the increased HoT per specimen as seen in Table 4.

Discussion

210

The present study compared the analytical sensitivity (LOD), clinical performance, and workflow

211

of three SARS-CoV-2 NAATs in 150 NP swab specimens. Our two independent LOD analyses revealed that

212

while all 3 assays had an LOD that was within 1 dilution factor of each other within a given control material,

213

absolute LODs with quantified inactivated virus (500- 1,000 GE/ml) were several-fold higher than the

214

value obtained when using quantified synthetic RNA (62.5- 125 copies/ml). This difference in absolute

215

LOD values reflects the inherent difficulty in comparing standards that have been prepared and

216

quantitated differently and have very high stock concentrations requiring significant dilutions for LOD

217

panel testing (i.e., any quantification error and/or pipetting error of the stock will be magnified in a

218

dilution series). Of interest, the LOD calculations for BioFire using the synthetic RNA standard only showed

219

amplification in two of three gene targets, since ORF1ab is included in the Exact diagnostics control, but

220

ORF 8 is not included. Considering this discrepancy, the decreased LOD relative to the Fusion and Aptima

221

when using the quantified synthetic RNA is likely due to the lack of ORF 8 target material. Our clinical

222

correlation showed that the Fusion and Biofire had similar PPA (98.7%), while the Aptima showed a slight

223

decrease at 94.7% PPA due to 4 false negative results among samples in the frozen retrospective set.

224

Cohen’s kappa values showed almost perfect agreement (range: 0.947 – 0.987) between each assay and

225

the consensus result. NPAs were 100% for all NAATs, suggesting each of these assays has high specificity.

226

All discordant results were false negatives as compared to the consensus result, with Fusion and

227

BioFire each demonstrating one missed positive and Aptima demonstrating four missed positives. A closer

228

analysis of discordant results showed that the sample missed by the Fusion (GSD-23) only had two gene

229

targets detected by BioFire (2a/2e) and the sample missed by the BioFire (GSD-7) had a Ct value of 35.7

230

on the Fusion. All four samples missed by the Aptima (GSD-3, 4, 6, and 48) had Ct values ranging from

231

37.3- 40.5, suggesting that the Aptima assay is slightly less sensitive than the Fusion and Biofire assays. Of

232

note, two of the specimens missed by the Aptima (GSD-4 and 48) were also each equivocal twice by BioFire

11

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.097311; this version posted May 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

233

and resulted as positive as per the EUA IFU, suggesting that these were also weak positives on the BioFire

234

assay.

235

Workflow comparisons between the Fusion and the Aptima were quite similar, both being optimal

236

in high-volume testing situations (> 1,000 tests/24 hours), whereas the BioFire assay had an advantage of

237

fast sample to answer time, allowing for faster detection and diagnosis that is useful in urgent situations.

238

Other comparator studies of the Fusion assay have recently been reported, including: a study

239

comparing Fusion to the modified CDC assay, GenMark ePlex, DiaSorin Simplexa (6); a study comparing

240

Cepheid, ID NOW, and GenMark using Fusion as the reference standard (7); a study comparing Fusion,

241

Cepheid, DiaSorin, cobas, and a laboratory-developed test (LDT) (8); and a study comparing Fusion to an

242

in-house LDT targeting the envelope gene (9). In general, these reports show that the Fusion SARS-CoV-2

243

assay is comparable, if not superior, to other molecular platforms available for SARS-CoV-2 testing. In

244

particular, these evaluations showed that Fusion, DiaSorin and Cepheid tended to have better analytical

245

sensitivity and fewer false negatives in clinical testing than other assays. The low rate of false negatives is

246

a critical performance aspect, as missed positive results allow for further spread of the disease and

247

potential patient mismanagement. These comparison studies, while not clinical trials as would be typical

248

of new FDA-cleared IVD assays, have provided a window into the relative real world clinical performance

249

characteristics of these assays, which has been a significant knowledge gap since these SARS-CoV-2 EUA

250

molecular assays first became available. Among these knowledge gaps are relative performance data for

251

the Aptima and BioFire tests. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing both the Aptima and

252

BioFire assay to any other NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

253

It is worth noting that the LOD for the Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay as determined in this study was

254

1,000 GE/ml when using inactivated virus, while the LOD determined in a previous study by our laboratory

255

was 83 ±36 copies/ml (6) and an additional LOD study performed as part of this study once again using

256

the same synthetic quantified RNA standard also previously published showed a comparable LOD of 62.5

257

copies/ml. This is an important additional new set of data that exhibits the difficulty of comparing absolute

258

LOD values when using different standards, specifically inactivated virus vs. synthetic RNA standards.

259

This study does have limitations, being a single site study with a limited number of NP swab

260

specimens (n = 150) included in the clinical evaluation. However, this specimen set was selected to be

261

representative of our patient population (including samples from patients of all ages and both genders)

262

and positivity rate (50-60% in the beginning of April 2020), and included samples with a range of viral

263

loads (low, moderate, high). Some initial equivocal or invalid results (n=3) by BioFire and Fusion required

264

retesting, but only 1 remained unresolved on retest and was removed from the agreement analysis for

265

the Fusion assay.

266

In conclusion, our data show that the Fusion, Aptima and BioFire SARS-CoV-2 NAATs exhibit

267

similar LODs, even when tested using two different quantified standards. In addition, the Fusion and

268

BioFire assays have comparable clinical performance for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in NP swabs, with a PPA

269

of 98.7%, while the Aptima assay showed a slight reduction at 94.7% PPA. All 3 assays demonstrated 100%

270

NPA, suggesting high specificity. These performance characteristics, as well as testing volume and

271

workflow requirements, should be considered when making testing platform decisions.
