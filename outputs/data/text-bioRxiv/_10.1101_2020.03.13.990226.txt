Abstract

19

A global pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute

20

respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing spread. It remains unclear

21

whether the convalescing patients have a risk of reinfection. Rhesus macaques were

22

rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 during an early recovery phase from initial infection

23

characterized by weight loss, interstitial pneumonia and systemic viral dissemination

24

mainly in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The monkeys rechallenged with the

25

identical SARS-CoV-2 strain have failed to produce detectable viral dissemination,

26

clinical manifestations and histopathological changes. A notably enhanced neutralizing

27

antibody response might contribute the protection of rhesus macaques from the

28

reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection

29

protects from subsequent reinfection.

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 might protect rhesus macaques which

33

have undergone an initial infection from reinfection during early recovery days.

39

The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

40

syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan China, has continued to sweep

41

through Europe, America, Asia and more than millions of people have been diagnosed

42

cross the world (1, 2). Some patients discharged with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 have

43

been found re-positive during viral detection (3-5). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)

44

were detected 15 days posterior the onset of COVID-19 (6-8). Whether patients have a

45

risk of "relapse" or "reinfection" after recovery from initial infection have aroused the

46

worldwide concern. Therefore, in this study, we used nonhuman primates to track the

47

longitudinally infectious status from primary SARS-CoV-2 infection to reinfection by

48

the same viral strain. Seven adult Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (No M0-M6, 3-5 kg,

49

3-5-year-old) were modeled for challenge-rechallenge observation. Six monkeys (M1

50

to M6) were intratracheally challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 1×106 50% tissue-culture

51

infectious doses (TCID50). After they underwent mild-to-moderate COIVD-19 and

52

stepped into recovering stage from the primary infection, four monkeys (M3 to M6)

53

were rechallenged intratracheally with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain at 28 days

54

post initial challenge (dpi). Remained two monkeys (M1 and M2) with primary

55

infection were not rechallenged to perform as negative control of rechallenged group.

56

A healthy monkey (M0) was given an initial challenge as model control in the second

57

challenge. The pathological changes with viral-dependent distribution were compared

58

using necropsy specimens between two monkeys undergone challenge-rechallenge (M3

59

and M5) at 5 days post rechallenge (dpr, 33 dpi) and two monkeys undergone only

60

initial challenge (M0 at 5 dpi and M1 at 7 dpi). Clinical traits including body weight,

61

body temperature, chest X-ray, peripheral blood measurement, nasal/throat/anal swabs,

62

virus distribution, and pathological changes were examined at designated time points

63

(Figure 1). Weight loss ranged from 200 g to 400 g were found in four monkeys

64

undergone initial challenge (4/7) (Figure 2A), and none of monkey’s rectal temperature

65

was observed elevated (0/7) (Figure 2B). Reduced appetite and/or increased respiration

66

were common (6/7) but emerged transiently with a very short time. In regard to viral

67

dissemination, peak viral load (6.5 log10 RNA copies/mL) was detected in nasal swabs

68

and pharyngeal swabs at 3 dpi followed with gradual decline (Figure 2C and 2D). Peak

69

viral load (5 log10 RNA copies/mL) could be detected using anal swabs at 3 dpi followed

70

with linearly declined to undetectable level at 14 dpi (Figure 2E). For all monkeys with

71

the initial challenge, white blood cell (WBC, 3.5-9.5×109/L), lymphocyte counts

72

(LYMP, 1.1-3.4×109/L) and neutrophil counts (NEUT, 1.8-6.4×109/L) fluctuated within

73

normal ranges. Comparing to the baseline, a slight yet significant reduction of WBC

74

and LYMP was observed posterior primary infection (*p<0.05, Figure 2F). T

75

lymphocyte subsets including CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells maintained relatively

76

stable during the primary infectious stage (Figure 2G). Specific antibody against SARS-

77

CoV-2 was gradually increased, leading to the concentration significantly higher at 21

78

dpi compared to that at 3 dpi (*p<0.05, Figure 2H). Radiologically, bilateral ground-

79

glass opacities were shown, indicating mild-to-moderate interstitial infiltration in

80

monkeys with pneumonia (Represented by M4, Figure 3A). Using necropsy specimens,

81

viral RNA copies were detected in nose (106 to 108 copies/mL), pharynx (104 to 106

82

copies/mL), lung (103 to 107 copies/mL) and gut (104 to 106 copies/mL) (Figure 3B,

83

upper panel).

84

Through HE staining, a mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by

85

widened alveolar septa, increased alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes in the

86

alveolar interstitium, and degenerated alveolar epithelia, and infiltrated inflammatory

87

cells were shown in lung from monkeys with primary infection. Amount of collagen

88

fiber could be also observed in the thickened alveolar interstitium in M0 and M1

89

monkeys by Modified Masson's Trichrome stain at 5 or 7 dpi (Figure 3C). Meanwhile,

90

the mucous membranes of trachea, tonsil, pulmonary lymph node, jejunum and colon

91

in M0 and M1 exhibited inflammatory cell infiltrations (Figure S1), and infiltration

92

with abundant CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, macrophages and plasma cells in

93

lung were specified by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) (Figure S2). The virus-

94

infected cells were mainly found in alveolar epithelia and macrophages by IHC on

95

sequential sections (Figure 3D), as well as the mucous membranes of trachea, tonsil,

96

pulmonary lymph node, jejunum and colon (Figure S1), confirming the SARS-CoV-2

97

could cause the COVID-19 in rhesus monkeys. Collectively, these data demonstrated

98

that all the seven monkeys were successfully infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the

99

characteristic of pathogenicity in monkey is similar to recent study(9-13).

100

At about 15 days posterior initial challenge, the body weight of infected monkeys

101

(M2 to M6) gradually increased into normal range (4/5, except for M4, Figure 2A). All

102

viral loads from nasopharyngeal and anal swabs returned negative (5/5, Figure 2C to

103

2E). In sera, spike protein-specific antibodies could be detected (5/5, Figure 2H, from

104

14 dpi). Chest X-ray resumed to normality at 28 dpi (5/5, Represented by M4, Figure

105

3A). These traits were similar to the discharging criteria including absence of clinical

106

symptoms, radiological abnormalities and twice negative RT-PCR negativity in human

107

infections (14). Taken together, it took about two weeks for monkeys undergone initial

108

SARS-CoV-2 stepped into recovery stage (10, 15).

109

At 28 dpi, four monkeys (M3 to M6) undergone primary infection and recovery

110

were rechallenged with the same dose of an identical SARS-CoV-2 strain

111

intratracheally. The clinical tracking of the reinfection included weight loss (Figure 2A)

112

and anal temperature (Figure 2B). A very interesting phenomenon was that the

113

rechallenged monkeys exhibited a transiently increased temperature, which was not

114

observed during the primary infection. Viral loads remained negative for a two-week

115

intensive detection using nasopharyngeal and anal swabs post rechallenge of SARS-

116

CoV-2 (Figure 2C to 2E). Peripheral blood measurements revealed no significant

117

fluctuation during the rechallenging stage (Figure 2F and 2G). Moreover, no remarked

118

abnormality of X-ray changes in M4 monkey at 33 dpi (5 dpr, Figure 3A). The only

119

notable elevation was the concentration of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at 42 dpi

120

(14 dpr), which is significantly higher than that at 28 dpi or 0 dpr (Figure 2H, ##p<0.01).

121

Using necropsy specimens, there were no detectable viral RNA (Figure 3B, lower

122

panel), significant pathological lesions (Figure 3C, Figure S1), virus-infected cells

123

(Figure 3D, Figure S1) and immune cells infiltration (Figure S2) in lung and

124

extrapulmonary tissue specimens from rechallenged monkeys (M3 and M5 at 5 dpr).

125

Therefore, the rhesus monkeys with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could not be

126

reinfected with the identical strain during their early recovering stage.

127

To interpret the challenge-rechallenge disparity, it seemed to address valuable

128

comparison of clinical, pathological and viral traits which comprehensively reflected

129

the virus-host interaction between primary challenging stage and rechallenging stage in

130

the four monkeys (M3 to M6). Firstly, viral loads from nasopharyngeal and anal swabs

131

at 5 or 7 dpi were much higher than that at 5 or 7 dpr. Secondly, increased percentage

132

of CD4+ T cells and decreased percentage of monocytes were observed at 7 dpr

133

compared to that at 7 dpi. Thirdly, also of the most importance, the concentration of

134

specific antibodies was much higher at 14 dpr than that at 14 dpi. The average titers of

135

neutralizing antibodies exhibited linearly increased enhancement post primary infection

136

(Table 1). Such gradually increased neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have

137

provided an endurable humeral immunity aroused by primary infection, which might

138

protect the same nonhuman primates from reinfection.

139

In the present challenge-rechallenge infection of SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys,

140

observation and detection were within the relative short time window that neutralizing

141

antibodies remained plateau after the primary infection. Moreover, all infected monkeys

142

affected relative mild-to-moderate pneumonia, which is similar to mild or common

143

clinical types of COVID-19 in the majority of the infected persons. Therefore, the

144

immunity of primarily infected hosts which have been mildly impaired could be

145

robustly resumed. Thirdly, mucosal immunity which have been aroused by primary

146

infection including both respiratory and intestinal mucosal and local lymph nodes might

147

contribute substantially against the newly attacked invasion of virus. A longer interval

148

(longer than 6 months) between the primary challenge and re-challenge is needed to

149

longitudinally track the host-virus interaction and elucidate the protective mechanism

150

against SARS-CoV-2 in primates.

Ethics statement

195

Seven 3- to 5-year old rhesus macaques, named as M0 to M6, were housed and cared

196

in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care

197

(AAALAC)-accredited facility. All animal procedures and experiments were carried

198

out in accordance with the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

199

Committee (IACUC) of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy

200

of Medical Sciences (BLL20001). All animals were anesthetized with ketamine

201

hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) prior to sample collection, and the experiments were

202

performed in the animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) laboratory.

Animal experiments

205

For primary infection, all animals were inoculated intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2

206

(SARS-CoV-2/WH-09/human/2020/CHN isolated in our laboratory) stock virus at a

207

dosage of 106 TCID50/1 mL inoculum volume. After the recovery, M3, M4, M5 and M6

208

were rechallenged intratracheally with the same dose (106 TCID50/1 mL inoculum

209

volume) SARS-CoV-2 at 28 dpi. To confirm the virus distribution and pathological

210

changes, M0 at 5 dpi, M1 at 7 dpi, M3 and M5 at 33 dpi (5 dpr) were euthanasia and

211

autopsied, respectively. All animals were monitored along the timeline to record body

212

weights, body temperature, clinical signs, nasal/throat/anal swabs, hematological

213

243

Sera were collected from each animal for the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibody

244

by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) along the detection timeline after the

245

initial infection. 96-well plates were coated with 0.1 μg Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2

246

(Sino Biological, 40591-V08H) overnight at 4°C and blocked with 2% BSA/PBST for

247

1 hour at room temperature. 1:100 diluted sera were added to each well and incubated

248

for 30 minutes at 37°C, followed by the HRP-labeled goat anti-monkey antibody

Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry

253

Autopsies were performed according to the standard protocol in ABSL3 laboratory at

254

5 or 7 dpi for M0 and M1, 5 dpr for M3 and M5. Tissues samples were fixed in 10%

255

neutral-buffered formalin solution. Then, paraffin sections (3-4 μm in thickness) were

256

prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and modified Masson's

257

Trichrome stain (Masson) prior to the observation by light microscopy. For

258

immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to identify the cell type and the expression of

259

SARS-CoV-2 antigen, paraffin dehydrated sections (3-4 µm in thickness) were treated

260

with an antigen retrieval kit (Boster, AR0022) for 1 min at 37℃ and quenched for

261

endogenous peroxidases in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min. After blocking in 1%

272

with 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and the image was viewed

273

under an Olympus microscope. The tissue sections (stored by our laboratory) of DMEM

274

(1 mL inoculation volume by intratracheal route)-treated monkey were used as a

275

negative control.

Neutralizing antibody assay

278

Sera samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibody observed by

279

cytopathic effect (CPE). Briefly, the sera from monkeys were heat-inactivated at 56℃

280

for 30 min. Then, serially two-fold diluted sera were incubated with 100 TCID50

281

SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C, and added into Vero-E6 cells in a 96-well-plate. Cells

282

were cultured for 1 week to observe for CPE and the serum dilution in which 50% of

283

the cells were protected from infection was calculated. Each dilution of serum was

284

tested in triplicates.

286

Statistical analysis

287

Comparisons between the two groups were determined using two-tailed unpaired

288

Student’s or Welch’s t-test. All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software.

289

The level of statistical significance is designated as *p＜0.05, **p＜0.01.

Figure 1 Experimental design and sample collection. Seven adult Chinese-origin

310

rhesus macaques (M0-M6) were enrolled in current study. At the outset of this

311

experiment, six monkeys (M1 to M6) were intratracheally challenged with SARS-CoV-

312

2 at 1×106 TCID50. After all the experimentally infected monkeys were recovery from

313

the primary infection, four infected monkeys (M3 to M6) were intratracheally

314

rechallenged at 28 days post initial challenge (dpi) with the same dose of SARS-CoV-

315

2 strain to ascertain the possibility of reinfection. Meanwhile, uninfected monkey (M0)

316

was also treated with SARS-CoV-2 as the model control in the second challenge, and

317

previously infected monkey (M2) was untreated again and continuously monitored as

318

the control. To compare the virus distribution and histopathological changes between

319

the initially infected monkeys and the reinfected monkeys, two monkeys per group (M0

320

and M1 in initial infection group, M3 and M5 in reinfection group) were euthanized

321

and necropsied at 5 (M0) or 7 (M1) dpi, 5 (M3 and M5) days post rechallenge (dpr),

322

respectively. Body weight, body temperature, nasal/throat/anal swabs, hematological

323

changes, immunocytes and specific antibody were measured along the timeline at a

324

short interval. Two measurements of virus distribution and histopathology (HE/IHC

Detection of viral RNA in nasal swabs, throat swabs and anal swabs. SARS-CoV-2

337

RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in the swabs from seven monkeys at the indicated time

points. (F and G) Hematological changes, including cell counts of WBC, LYMP and

339

NEUT, as wells as the percentage of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and monocytes in

340

peripheral blood were monitored respectively. (H) Levels of specific IgG against spike

341

protein in each monkey. The levels of anti-viral antigen specific IgG from each monkey

342

were detected at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 33 and 42 dpi. Four monkeys (M3-M6) were

343

rechallenged at 28 dpi (the dotted line and shaded areas), and the results of initial

344

infection and rechallenge were compared in bar graphs. The bars represented the

345

average of four rechallenged animals at the indicated time points. The viral RNA in

346

nasal, throat and anal swabs, of rechallenged animals were significantly lower than that

347

of initial infection, while the specific antibodies were significantly increased.

348

Meanwhile, significantly changes in hematological changes were observed between

349

primary and second challenge (unpaired t-test, *P<0.05, **P<0.01; ## P<0.01 42 dpi

350

vs 28 dpi).

373

in Figure 3D. The Spike-positive cells overlapped with either alveolar epithelial cells

374

or macrophages have shown the diffused interstitial pneumonia affected by SARS-

375

CoV-2 invasion. In M5 (5 dpr), no remarked pathological changes and virus distribution

376

were seen via HE staining, Masson staining or IHC, indicating the interstitial lesions
