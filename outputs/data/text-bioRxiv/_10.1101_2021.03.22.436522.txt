[Summary Paragraph]
We identify the prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) inhibitor halofuginone1, a compound in clinical trials
for anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory applications2, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection
and replication. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with cell surface heparan sulfate
(HS) promotes viral entry3. We find that halofuginone reduces HS biosynthesis, thereby reducing
spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Halofuginone also potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry and is 1,000-fold more
potent than Remdesivir4. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on
specific inhibition of PRS, possibly due to translational suppression of proline-rich proteins. We
find that pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several HS proteoglycans, are
proline-rich, which may make them particularly vulnerable to halofuginone’s translational
suppression. Halofuginone is orally bioavailable, has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in
humans and distributes to SARS-CoV-2 target organs, including the lung, making it a near-term
clinical trial candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.

[MAIN TEXT]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has swept across the globe causing 32.1 million infections
and 980,339 confirmed deaths as of September 24th 20205. In May 2020, the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Remdesivir (RDV, GS5734) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-196. In the preliminary report
of the ACTT-1 clinical trial subgroup analysis, Remdesivir significantly reduced time to recovery
only in patients who were on low-flow oxygen at baseline4. This finding suggested that Remdesivir
treatment in COVID-19 may provide greater benefit if started before the development of severe
disease7,8. However, data from multiple trials suggests that Remdesivir provides modest clinical
benefit compared with standard of care4,9,10. Furthermore, Remdesivir must be administered
intravenously, which functionally prevents its use in pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic mild
disease. Convalescent plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 has also
been granted EUA for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 but efficacy data from randomized
trials are needed. Hence, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for antiviral therapeutics that can
reduce COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality and that optimally could be administered
early after symptom onset to prevent the development of severe respiratory disease11,12.
SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung upper airway epithelial cells depends on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cell
surface heparan sulfate (HS)3,13,14. Blocking the interaction of cell surface HS and spike protein
attenuate SARS-CoV-2 binding and SARS-CoV-2 infection3. In this report we identified
halofuginone, a synthetic analog of the natural product febrifugine that is derived from Dichroa
febrifuga (one of the 50 fundamental herbs of traditional Chinese medicine), as a potent inhibitor
of HS biosynthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection1,15. We demonstrate that halofuginone reduces HS
biosynthesis, thereby decreasing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to cells, infection with SARSCoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped VSV virus, and infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2. Additionally,

halofuginone inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry. Inhibition of prolyl-tRNA
synthetase (PRS) activity was responsible for both the HS-dependent and the HS-independent
antiviral properties of halofuginone. These findings identify halofuginone as a translational
regulator of cell surface HS biosynthesis and a potentially potent, orally bioavailable, therapeutic
for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

RESULTS
Halofuginone Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding and Infection by SARS-CoV-2
Spike Protein Pseudotyped Virus.
To identify potential agents that attenuate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, we
screened a library of small-molecule antagonists of host epigenetic regulators and protein
translation elements of the prolyl-tRNA synthetase complex, along with their chemically matched
inactive analogs16-18. The compound library has been successfully used to investigate targets
mediating anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative effects in a variety of biological contexts16-18 and
importantly, contains several FDA-approved drugs, which may facilitate rapid deployment for
treatment of COVID-19 patients. Hep3B human hepatoma cells were treated with the compound
library at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 1a & Extended data Fig. 1) for 18 h, and binding of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was assessed using recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD; from
isolate Wuhan 20) in flow cytometry (Fig. 1a). As a positive control cells were treated with a
mixture of heparin lyases, which digest HS chains3. Class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitors, such
as Romidepsin (1 µM) or Belinostat (5 µM), decreased SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding by ~50%
compared to excipient control (DMSO; Fig 1a). Halofuginone (1 µM) reduced binding by 84%, a
level of reduction similar to the impact of heparin lyase treatment (Fig 1a). Halofuginone targets
the prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS) active site of the human glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase
(EPRS) and has been used in clinical and preclinical studies to treat fibrotic disease and to

attenuate hyperinflammation1,19. We then treated Vero E6 African green monkey kidney epithelial
cells, Caco-2 human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and Calu-3 human epithelial lung
adenocarcinoma cells with halofuginone. Halofuginone reduced RBD protein binding to Hep3B,
Calu-3 and Caco-2 but showed very modest effects in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1b-e). The degree of
inhibition was greatest in the Calu-3 line (5-fold reduction in RBD binding; Fig. 1e). To test the
effect of halofuginone on the binding of spike protein in a more native presentation, we examined
the ability of halofuginone to inhibit infection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped VSV in
Hep3B cells. Halofuginone inhibited infection by up to ~30-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
1f). Consistent with the inability of halofuginone to reduce RBD binding to Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1c),
no inhibition of infection was seen in these cells (Fig. 1g). We next tested if halofuginone inhibits
the infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in Hep3B. Cells were treated with halofuginone at different
doses for 24 h prior to and during infection (MOI of 0.1) (Fig. 1h)20. The culture medium was
collected, and the presence of virus was measured by plaque assays in Vero E6 cells. No
infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the supernatants of Hep3B cells treated with
halofuginone at doses greater than 50 nM (Fig. 1h). To explore the effect of halofuginone on
SARS-CoV-2 infection in a more clinically relevant model, we grew primary human bronchial
epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface and infected them with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus
with and without halofuginone treatment. Halofuginone significantly reduced the number of SARSCoV-2 infected cells at both 10 nM and 100 nM without affecting cell viability (Fig. 1i-j & Extended
data Fig. 2).

Halofuginone Inhibits Heparan Sulfate Biosynthesis
The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to cells is HS-dependent3. HS is a linear
polysaccharide attached to serine residues in HS proteoglycans (HSPGs)21. The HS
polysaccharides consist of alternating residues of N-acetylated or N-sulfated glucosamine
(GlcNAc or GlcNS) and either glucuronic acid (GlcA) or iduronic acid (IdoA) (Fig. 2a). Hence, we

tested if halofuginone reduces spike protein binding by reducing HS presentation at the cell
surface. Hep3B and Vero E6 cells were treated for 18 h with halofuginone and the effects on
cellular HS were evaluated using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) (10E4) that recognizes a
common epitope in HS (Fig. 2b & Extended data Fig. 3). Halofuginone dose-dependently
reduced 10E4 binding in Hep3B (Fig. 2c), whereas 10E4 binding increased in Vero E6 upon
halofuginone treatment (Fig. 2d). This directly correlates with the level of spike RBD binding and
S protein pseudotyped virus infection in these cells (Fig. 1b-c). This finding suggests that
halofuginone inhibits spike protein binding and SARS-CoV-2 viral attachment by altering cell
surface HS content. Analysis of Hep3B cells showed that 0.5 µM halofuginone reduced cell
surface HS in Hep3B cells by ~4-fold (Fig. 2e). No difference was seen in the disaccharide
composition following halofuginone treatment, suggesting that halofuginone affects total HS
synthesis but does not alter HS specific sulfation (Fig. 2f). To test if the observed decrease in total
HS was due to a decrease in availability of HSPG core proteins to carry HS, we lysed treated
Hep3B cells, ran the lysates on SDS-PAGE and stained using an mAb (3G10) that recognizes a
neo-epitope remaining on the proteoglycans (Fig. 2b,g)

22

. The analysis revealed that

halofuginone reduced the expression of core HSPGs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g &
Extended data Fig. 4). These data suggest that halofuginone inhibits HS-mediated binding of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to cells by inhibiting the expression of HSPGs.
To broadly examine the effects of halofuginone treatment, Hep3B cells were treated with
vehicle or halofuginone at 200 or 500 nM for 6 h and 18 h and processed for RNA-sequencing
(RNA-Seq). Halofuginone profoundly impacted the transcriptome (~2700 differentially expressed
genes), which increased with longer incubation time (Extended data Fig. 5a-b). Principal
component analysis clearly segregated the response with respect to the duration of treatment
(Extended data Fig. 5a). Analysis of halofuginone upregulated genes did not identify common
pathways associated with antiviral or inflammatory responses (Extended data Fig. 5c-d)23.
Additionally, no significant difference in expression of host factors exploited by SARS-CoV-2, such

as TMPRSS2 and ACE2, were observed (Extended data Fig. 5f-g). Gene annotation analysis of
downregulated genes at 6 h showed that 200 nM halofuginone altered the expression of genes
involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis and proteoglycan metabolic processes (Extended data Fig.
5e)23. A select group of core HSPGs were downregulated at the mRNA level (Extended data Fig.
5f-g). In particular, HSPGs GPC2 and SDC1 were significantly downregulated in conjunction with
the HS biosynthetic enzymes B3GAT3 and EXTL3 (Extended data Fig. 5f-g & 6). Taken
together, the data demonstrates that halofuginone suppresses the expression of proteins involved
in HS and HSPG production.

Halofuginone Inhibition of Spike Protein Binding to Heparan Sulfate is Independent of the
Canonical Integrated Stress Response.
Aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases (AARS) catalyze the ATP-dependent synthesis of aminoacylated tRNAs via a two-step reaction involving an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate with
subsequent transfer to the cognate tRNAs24. Halofuginone and chemically unrelated compounds
like prolyl-sulfamoyl adenosine (ProSA), specifically and potently inhibit human prolyl-tRNA
synthetase (PRS) by blocking distinct portions of their ligand binding pockets (Fig. 3a-c)15,25. PRS
inhibition can specifically suppress translation of proteins, such as collagens, that are enriched in
prolines while having minimal effects on general protein synthesis15. However, PRS inhibition can
also lead to GCN2-mediated activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). GCN2 (gene
symbol EIF2AK4) senses uncharged tRNAs and phosphorylates the eukaryotic transcription
initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), leading to a general reduction in 5’cap-mediated RNA translation and
selective translation of the eukaryotic transcription factor ATF4 and its target genes (Fig. 3a)26.
These genes contain structural features in their 5’UTR allowing for selective translation in the
presence of Ser51 phosphorylated eIF2a. The complexity and transient nature of the
transcriptional and translational changes mediated by different eIF2a kinases of the ISR allows a

cell to adapt and resolve various stress situations including amino acid starvation or unfolded
protein stress26.
Interestingly, halofuginone induced a general ATF4-mediated ISR but did not activate the
unfolded protein-induced ER stress response, as reported previously (Extended data Fig. 5d)27.
To date, alterations in HS biosynthesis have not been identified as a hallmark of the ISR. To better
understand the relationship between PRS inhibition and HS expression we tested related PRS
inhibitor analogs to deconstruct the PRS pathway in relation to HS biosynthesis and spike RBD
binding. Treatment with the non-cleavable and highly selective prolyl-AMP substrate analog
ProSA at 5 µM prevented HS presentation and spike RBD binding to similar levels as treatment
with halofuginone (500 nM), as illustrated by mAb 10E4 stain (Fig. 3c-d)28. Additionally,
halofuginol (HFol), a halofuginone derivative that inhibits PRS, significantly decreased 10E4 and
spike RBD binding while the MAZ1310 negative control compound, had no effect (Fig. 3d-e)15,25.
Collectively, the data demonstrates that PRS inhibition is sufficient to reduce HS biosynthesis and
spike RBD binding (Fig. 3d-e). Halofuginone competes with proline for the PRS active site15.
Addition of excess proline to the media (4mM) of Hep3B cells prevented the ability of halofuginone
to inhibit RBD protein binding to the cells (Fig. 3f).
To determine if halofuginone suppresses HS biosynthesis by activating the ISR we coincubated halofuginone in the presence of a general inhibitor of the ISR, ISRIB (Integrated Stress
Response inhibitor), selective eIF2a kinase inhibitors GCN2-IN-1 (GCN2i) targeting GCN2
(general control nonderepressible 2), or GSK2606414 (PERKi) targeting eIF2a kinase 3
(eIF2AK3), also known as protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (Fig.
3A)26,29. Neither PERKi nor ISRIB affected 10E4 or RBD binding, and neither had an effect on
halofuginone inhibition (Fig. 3g-h). In contrast, GCN2i reduced 10E4 and RBD binding almost to
the same extent as halofuginone activity (Fig. 3g-h), suggesting a role for GCN2 in the regulation
of HS biosynthesis independent of the ISR. Neither GCN2-IN-1, GSK2606414, nor ISRIB

reversed the halofuginone induced reduction in 10E4 or spike protein binding, suggesting that
halofuginone does not suppress HS biosynthesis and spike binding by activating the ISR (Fig. 3gh).
PRS inhibitors can selectively modulate the translational efficiency of proline-rich proteins,
such as collagens (Extended data Fig. 7). Interestingly, HSPGs, such as agrin, perlecan,
collagen 18 and syndecans 1 and 3, are relatively proline-rich compared to other proteins, such
as TMPRSS2, ACE2 and lysosomal or cholesterol biosynthetic proteins (Fig. 3i and Extended
data Fig. 7-9; Extended data Table 1). These observations suggest that inhibition of prolyl-tRNA
charging could impair production of key membrane and extracellular matrix HSPGs (Fig. 3i and
2g). Together, these data suggest that PRS inhibitors, such as halofuginone, inhibit HS and
proteoglycan expression both at the translational and transcriptional level.

Halofuginone Inhibits infection and Replication by Authentic SARS-CoV-2
To determine if halofuginone inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus production was due to
reduced viral entry or subsequent intra-host replication, Huh 7.5 cells were treated with 100 nM
halofuginone or vehicle, either before, after, or before and after infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Similarly, as in Hep3B halofuginone prevented productive infection of Huh 7.5 without affecting
cell viability (Fig. 4a-b, and Extended data Fig. 10). Pretreatment with halofuginone alone
significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection by ~30-fold (Fig. 4a). However, halofuginone added
after viral infection reduced the amount of secreted infectious virions by nearly 1000-fold (Fig. 4a).
Intracellular viral RNA did not change when the cells were only treated before infection as
expected, but viral RNA levels dramatically decreased 10- to 100-fold when halofuginone was
present after infection (Fig. 4b). These observations suggest that halofuginone inhibits SARSCoV-2 viral replication in addition to suppressing HS-dependent infection.
Halofuginone did not decrease cellular HS or the binding of recombinant RBD protein in
Vero E6 cells. However, given the effects of halofuginone treatment on viral replication we
10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436522; this version posted March 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

examined the effect of halofuginone on infection by authentic SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells as
well. Halofuginone completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at 50 nM with an IC50 of 13 nM as
measured by immunofluorescent (IF) detection of the nucleocapsid protein and plaque assays
(Fig. 4c-d & Extended data Fig. 11). In comparison, Remdesivir had a calculated IC50 of 8 µM.
Thus, halofuginone showed a ~1,000-fold more potent inhibition of infection as compared to
Remdesivir in this experimental setup (Fig. 4c-d). Similarly, halofuginone was 100-fold more
potent compared to chloroquine (IC50 1.9 µM) (Extended data Fig. 12). Moreover, halofuginone
treatment reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike intracellular mRNA levels more than 20,000-fold with an
IC50 of 34.9 nM (Fig. 4e).
We next examined if the impact of halofuginone on viral replication was dependent on
PRS inhibition. Halofuginone competes with proline for the PRS active site15. Addition of excess
proline to the media (4mM) of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells increased the IC50 of
halofuginone from 12.5 nM to 210 nM (Fig 4f). Commercial halofuginone is a racemate of two,
2S,3R-(-) and 2R,3S-(+) enantiomers30. Hence, we evaluated if viral inhibition was due to ontarget effects of the PRS targeting 2R,3S-(+) enantiomer (Fig. 4g)30. The 2R,3S-(+) inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity with an IC50 of 12 nM compare to an IC50 of 28 nM for the racemic mixture.
No inhibition was observed when using the non-targeting 2S,3R-(-) (Fig. 4g). Analogous, only the
active 2R,3S-(+) enantiomer inhibited HS production and authentic SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD
protein binding (Extended data Fig. 13-14).
Like halofuginone, other PRS inhibitors ProSA and halofuginol inhibited authentic SARSCoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, although at significantly higher doses (Fig. 4h). The negative
control compound, MAZ1310, did not (Fig. 4h). These results demonstrate that inhibition of PRS
activity suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4h). Inhibitors of the ISR, as well as inhibitors of
eIF2-alpha kinases PERK and GCN2 were unable to attenuate the halofuginone-mediated
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Fig. 4i). Hence, the observed antiviral effect is not dependent
on ISR activation, consistent with the effects seen on the binding of recombinant RBD spike

protein and mAb 10E4 binding (Fig. 3c-d).31,32 Upon cell entry, SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is
translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a (>400 kDa) and pp1ab (>700 kDa) that undergo
proteolytic processing into 11 or 16 non-structural proteins, respectively, many of which are
required for RNA replication. Both pp1a (R1A) and pp1ab (R1AB), and to a lesser degree spike
protein, have high proline contents comparable to collagens (Fig. 4j & Extended data Fig. 15;
Extended data table 1). To probe the importance of the viral protein proline content versus
general mRNA translation inhibition we evaluated two other AARS inhibitors, borrelidin and serylsulfamoyl adenosine (SerSA) that target the threonyl- and seryl-tRNA-synthetase, respectively.
Niether of these AARS inhibitors were able to significantly attenuate viral replication (Fig. 4k) or
Spike protein binding (Extended data Fig. 16), suggesting that proline translation is the Achilles
heel for SARS-CoV-2 replication and possible other RNA viruses33,34.

DISCUSSION
We show that halofuginone is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in numerous cell
types, including primary human bronchial epithelial cells. This small molecule decreases HSdependent spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, and infection by authentic
SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, it also inhibits authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection post-entry by an HSindependent mechanism. Mechanistically, halofuginone suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection by
inhibiting the PRS, which could suppress the translation of long proline-rich host attachment
factors, particularly HSPGs, and SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that encode proteins
required for viral replication. Thus, halofuginone is a potent host-targeting antiviral with dual
inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2.
There is a desperate need for a potent, orally bioavailable antiviral for the treatment of
COVID-19 that can be administered early in the disease to prevent hospitalization and the
development of severe pulmonary disease. Here, we demonstrate that halofuginone is a potent
inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range, in multiple in vitro

models of infection. Halofuginone is orally bioavailable and reached an average Cmax of 0.54 ng/ml
(~1.3 nM) or 3.09 ng/ml (~7.4 nM) after a single administration of 0.5 mg or 3.5 mg doses in a
phase I clinical trial35. The long half-life (~30 h) leads to accumulation of halofuginone, with twoto three-fold higher exposure by day 15 of dosing35. Halofuginone widely distributed in tissues
after administration in mice with the highest tissue concentrations in the lung and kidney36.
Expressed as area under the curve, halofuginone exposure was more than 87-fold higher in the
lung compared to plasma after a single intravenous injection in mice36. This suggests that
although it may be difficult to obtain halofuginone plasma levels significantly above the IC50 values
determined in this study, doses tested in phase I trials may be sufficient to achieve significant
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in the lung and other organs infected by SARS-CoV-237-40.
Excessive inflammation can contribute to inflammatory organ injury during severe COVID19. There are multiple anti-inflammatory agents under evaluation for the treatment of COVID-19
and low dose dexamethasone recently demonstrated lower 28-day mortality in individuals
receiving respiratory support41. In addition to the antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that is
described here, halofuginone has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity that may provide yet
another additive benefit to individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia1,2,15,42-44.
We demonstrate that other PRS inhibitors, ProSA and halofuginol, also inhibit infection by
authentic SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggests that PRS inhibition may be particularly effective at
suppressing the production of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that are long and
proline-rich. Other positive-sense ssRNA viruses produce long polyproteins that may be similarly
sensitive to PRS or other AARS inhibitors. Consistent with this idea, halofuginone demonstrates
antiviral activity against future deleterious coronaviruses and other positive ssRNA viruses,
including Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Sindbis virus (Extended data Fig. 17;
Extended data table 1)45.
In addition to halofuginone, other PRS inhibitors are being evaluated in humans, including
DWN12088 that is in phase I clinical trials in Australia and anticipated to be used for the treatment

of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, evaluation of PRS inhibitors, halofuginone analogs, and
other AARS inhibitors may lead to the identification of additional broad-spectrum antiviral agents.
Viruses require host cell resources for replication and thus can be inhibited by therapeutics that
target essential host factors. This approach could provide broad activity against diverse viruses
while decreasing the risk of emerging viral resistance as the therapy is not directed against a
specific virally encoded product. On the other hand, targeting host factors can lead to cytostatic
and cytotoxicity, and we did observe the reported anti-proliferative effect of halofuginone in our
assays (Extended data Fig. 17)2. Although inhibition of global translation could lead to excessive
toxicity, inhibiting AARSs could provide a more precise way of inhibiting viral proteins and thus
limit toxicity. It appears that normal cells are relatively tolerant of decreased AARS levels with
minimal effects on global translation. Individuals who are heterozygous carriers for recessive
inactivating AARS mutations linked to hypomyelinating leukodystrophy do not display disease
phenotypes46.
In conclusion, we identified halofuginone as an antiviral with potent inhibitory activity
against SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple human cell types. We show that halofuginone reduces
both HS and HSPG biosynthesis, that are required for viral adhesion. In addition, we find that the
inhibitory capacity of halofuginone on SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to HS reduction, but
also shows potent inhibition in the viral replication stage. Mechanistically, our data suggests that
these effects are caused by PRS inhibition and its effect on production of proline-rich proteins and
not dependent on ISR activation. This observation is in agreement with previous studies reporting
that coronaviruses overcome the inhibitory effects of eIF2a phosphorylation on viral mRNA
translation

31,32

. Furthermore, many viruses, including coronaviruses (SARS1 and SARS2),

shutdown host translation using nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) and activate eIF2a associated
PERK dependent stress responses that benefit the virus47. Halofuginone may prevent SARSCoV-2 from circumventing these mechanisms of host protein translational shutdown.

Halofuginone oral administration has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in humans
and based on pharmacological studies in mice is distributed to SARS-CoV-2 target organs,
including the lung. In conclusion, we show that halofuginone is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2
infection which emphasizes its potential as an effective treatment for COVID-19 in the clinic.
Beyond its antiviral activity, halofuginone has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties
that may provide additive benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on this in vitro
preclinical data we believe halofuginone could be an effective antiviral and antifibrotic agent for
the treatment of individuals with COVID-19.

METHODS
Reagents
SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike Protein (RBD, His Tag) (Sino Biologicals, 40592-V08B), and
proteins were biotinylated using EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, No-Weigh™ (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, A39256). Heparin lyases were from IBEX pharmaceuticals, Heparinase I (IBEX, 60012), Heparinase II (IBEX, 60-018), Heparinase III (IBEX, 60-020). Protein production reagents
included, Pierce™ Protein Concentrators PES Thermo Scientific™, Pierce™ Protein
Concentrator PES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88517) and Zeba™ Spin Desalting Columns, 40K
MWCO, 0.5 mL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 87766). ISR pathway inhibitors used are ISRIB
(Sigma, SML0843), GSK2606414 (Sigma, 516535), and A-92 (Axon, 2720). Antibodies used
were, anti-Spike antibody [1A9] (GeneTex, GTX632604), anti-Nucleocapsid antibody (GeneTex,
GTX135357), Anti-HS (Clone F58-10E4) (Fisher Scientific, NC1183789), and 3G10 (BioLegend,

streptomycin sulfate and grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were
passaged before 80% confluence was reached and seeded as explained for the individual
assays. Cell viability was measured using LDH leakage (Promega) or alamarBleu (Thermo
Fisher).

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein production
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (GenBank: MN975262.1; amino acid residues 319-529) was
cloned into pVRC vector containing a HRV 3C-cleavable C-terminal SBP-His8X tag was produced
in ExpiCHO cells by transfection of 6 x106 cells/ml at 37 ºC with 0.8 µg/ml of plasmid DNA using
the ExpiCHO expression system transfection kit in ExpiCHO Expression Medium (ThermoFisher).
One day later the cells were fed with ExpiCho Feed, treated with ExpCho Enhancer, and then
incubated at 32 ºC for 11 days. The conditioned medium was mixed with cOmplete EDTA-free
Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Recombinant protein was purified by chromatography on a Ni2+
Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (1 ml, GE LifeSciences). Samples were loaded in ExpiCHO
Expression Medium supplemented with 30 mM imidazole, washed in a 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH
7.4) containing 30 mM imidazole and 0.5 M NaCl. Recombinant protein was eluted with buffer
containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.3 M imidazole. The protein was further purified by size exclusion
chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200, prep grade. GE LifeSciences) in 20 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 M NaCl.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD Biotinylation
For binding studies, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD protein (RBD, His Tag) was
conjugated with EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (1:3 molar ratio; Thermo Fisher) in Dulbecco’s PBS
at room temperature for 30 min. Glycine (0.1 M) was added to quench the reaction and the buffer
was exchanged for PBS using a Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher).

Flow cytometry
Cells at 50-70% confluence were treated with halofuginone or other inhibitors for 18-24 hrs. The
cells were lifted with PBS containing 10 mM EDTA (Gibco) and washed in PBS containing 0.1%
BSA. The cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 105 cells per well. As a control for HSdependent spike protein adhesion, a portion of the cells were treated with HSase mix (2.5 mU/ml
HSase I, 2.5 or 5 mU/ml HSase II, and 5 mU/ml HSase III; IBEX) for 30 min at 37 oC in PBS
containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were stained for 30 min at 4oC with biotinylated spike RBD protein
(20 µg/ml) or 10E4 mAB in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were washed twice and then
reacted for 30 min at 4oC with Streptavadin-Cy5 (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000 dilution) or anti-mouse
IgG-Alexa488, respectively, in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were washed twice and then
analyzed using a FACSCalibur or a FACSCanto instrument (BD Bioscience). All experiments
were done a minimum of three separate times in three technical replicates. Data analysis was
performed using FlowJo software and statistical analyses were done in Prism 8 (GraphPad).

HS and CS purification from cell surface of Hep3B cells
Fresh Hep3B cells were was washed in PBS, lifted with trypsin, and centrifuged for 5 min a 500
x g. The trypsin supernatants were saved for GAG analysis, and the cell pellets were washed in
complete media, followed by a PBS wash, and saved for BCA analysis (Pierce™ BCA Protein
Assay Kit, Themo Fisher), according to vendor specifications. The trypsin-released GAGs were
treated with 1 mg/mL Pronase (Streptomyces griseus, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.1% Triton X-100
and 10 mM CaCl2, and incubated at 37°C, overnight with shaking. The samples were
centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min and the supernatant was mixed 1:10 with equilibration
buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6) and loaded onto a DEAE
Sephacel column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with equilibration buffer. The column was
washed with wash buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 6.0) and bound GAGs were
eluted with elution buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 2.0 M NaCl, pH 6.0). The eluate was desalted

using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) and lyophilized until dry.. The GAG pellets were
reconstituted in DNase buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0)
with 20 kU/mL DNase I (Deoxyribonuclease I from Bovine Pancreas, Sigma Aldrich) and
incubated for 2 hr at 37°C, shaking. Finally, the GAGs were purified over a DEAE column and
precipitated by PD-10 chromatography 3.

HS and CS digestion and MS analysis
For HS quantification and disaccharide analysis, purified GAGs were digested with a mixture of
heparin lyases I-III (2 mU each) for 2 hr at 37 °C in lyase buffer (40 mM ammonium acetate and
3.3 mM calcium acetate, pH 7.0). For CS quantification and disaccharide analysis, the GAGs
were digested with 20 mU/mL Chondroitinase ABC (from Proteus vulgaris, Sigma Aldrich) and
incubated for 2 hr at 37°C in lyase buffer (50 mM Tris and 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). The reactions
were dried in a centrifugal evaporator and tagged by reductive amination with [12C6]aniline. The
HS and CS samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) and quantified by inclusion of [13C6]aniline-tagged standard HS
disaccharides (Sigma-Aldrich), as described (Lawrence et al., 2008). The samples were
separated on a reverse phase column (TARGA C18, 150 mm x 1.0 mm diameter, 5 µm beads,
Higgins Analytical, Inc.) using 5 mM dibutylamine as an ion pairing agent (Sigma-Aldrich), and
ions were monitored in negative mode. Separation was performed using the same gradient,
capillary temperature, and spray voltage as described (Lawrence et al., 2008). The analysis was
done on an LTQ Orbitrap Discovery electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific) equipped with an Ultimate 3000 quaternary HPLC pump (Dionex).

Western Blot Analysis
Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer, and protein was quantified using a BCA assay. Protein was

amount of protein loading. Proteins were visualized after transfer to Immobilon-FL PVDF
membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR
Biosciences) for 30 min and incubated overnight at 4°C with 3G10 antibodies. Mouse antibodies
were incubated with secondary Odyssey IR dye antibodies (1:14,000) and visualized with an
Odyssey IR imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).

RNA-seq library preparation
Cells were lysed in Trizol and total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol kit (Zymo Research,
CA USA). On column DNA digestion was also performed with DNAse treatment. Poly(A) RNA
was selected using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation module (New England
Biolabs) and libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit
(New England Biolabs) and sequenced using a NextSeq 500 (Illumina). Samples were sequenced
at a minimum depth of 15 million reads per sample, paired end with a read length of 2x41bp.

RNA sequencing data analysis
A computational pipeline was written calling scripts from the CGAT toolkit to analyse the RNA
sequencing data (https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-flow)

4,5

. Briefly, FASTQ files were

generated and assessed for quality using FASTQC, aligned to GRCh38 (hg38) and then aligned
to the transcriptome using hisat2 v2.1.0 6. To count mapped reads to individual genes,
featurecounts v1.4.6, part of the subreads package 7, was used. Differential gene expression
analysis was performed using DESeq2 using treatment and time as factors in the model. Genes
were considered to be differentially expressed based on log2 fold change and p-value < 0.05. R

Preparation and infection by pseudotyped VSV
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) pseudotyped with spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were generated
according to a published protocol

10

. Briefly, HEK293T, transfected to express full length SARS-

CoV-2 spike proteins, were inoculated with VSV-G pseudotyped ΔG-luciferase or GFP VSV
(Kerafast, MA). After 2 hr at 37°C, the inoculum was removed and cells were refed with DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin, and VSV-G antibody
(I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC). Pseudotyped particles were collected
20 hr post-inoculation, centrifuged at 1,320 × g to remove cell debris and stored at −80°C until
use. Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. The cells were then treated
with Halufuginone for 16hrs. As a control for HS dependent infection some cells were treated with
HSases for 30 min at 37 oC in serum-free DMEM. Culture supernatant containing pseudovirus
(20-100 µL) was adjusted to a total volume of 100 µL with PBS, HSase mix or the indicated
inhibitors and the solution was added to the cells. After 4 hr at 37 oC the media was changed to
complete DMEM. The cells were then incubated for 16 hr to allow expression of the luciferase
gene. Cells were analyzed for infection by Bright-GloTM (Promega) using the manufacturers
protocol. Briefly, 100 µL of luciferin lysis solution was added to the cells and incubated for 5 min
at room temperature. The solution was transferred to a black 96-well plate and luminescence was
detected using an EnSpire multimodal plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Data analysis and statistical
analysis was performed in Prism 8.

SARS-CoV-2 infection
SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources) was propagated and infectious units
quantified by plaque assay using Vero E6 (ATCC) cells. Approximately 10e4 Vero E6 cells per
well were seeded in a 96 well plate and incubated overnight. The following day, cells were washed
with PBS and 100uL of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.5) diluted in serum free DMEM was added per well
and incubated 1 h at 37°C with rocking every 10-15 min. After 1 h, virus was removed, cells

washed with PBS and compounds or controls were added at the indicated concentrations. In
experiments using inhibitors of the ISR or its related kinases, these compounds were added after
viral infection and incubated for 1 h prior to the addition of HF. For viral RNA quantification, cells
were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 200ul TRIzol (ThermoFisher). For immunofluorescence,
cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room
temperature. For plaque assays, supernatant was removed and stored at -80 until plaque assays
were performed.

Flavivirus and alphavirus infection
Sindbis virus (SINV) with mCherry-tagged NSP3 was propagated on BHK-15 cells 11. Uganda
strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) MR 766 encoding the fluorescent protein Venus from the genome (a
kind gift from Matthew Evans, Schwarz 2016) was propagated on Huh 7.5 cells 12. Huh 7.5 and
BHK-15 monolayers were pretreated with various halofuginone concentrations for 16 hours and
infected with SINV or ZIKV at MOI of 0.1 for two hours in the presence of the compound.
Subsequently, media over cells were replaced with fresh media containing halofuginone and
incubated for 12 hours for SINV and 24 hours for ZIKV. The cell culture supernatants were
collected at 12 hours post infection for SINV and 24 hours post infection for ZIKV and the virus
titers were determined by fluorescent focus assay (FFT).

Methods for human bronchial epithelial cell ALI generation and infection
Air Liquid Interface
Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBECs, Lonza) were cultured in T75 flasks in PneumaCult-Ex
Plus Medium according to manufacturer instructions (StemCell Technologies). To generate airliquid interface cultures, HBECs were plated on collagen I-coated 24 well transwell inserts with a
0.4-micron pore size (Costar, Corning) at 5x104 cells/ml. Cells were maintained for 3-4 days in
PneumaCult-Ex Plus Medium until confluence, then changed to PneumaCult-ALI Medium

(StemCell Technologies) containing ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Tocris) for 4 days. Fresh medium,
100 µl in the apical chamber and 500 µl in the basal chamber, was added daily. At day 7, the
medium in the apical chambers was removed, and the basal chambers were changed every 2-3
days with apical washes with PBS every week for 28 days.
Human bronchial epithelial cell ALI Infection.
The apical side of the HBEC ALI culture was gently washed three times with 200 µl of phosphate
buffered saline without divalent cations (PBS-/-). An MOI of 0.5 of SARS-CoV-2 live virus in 100
µl total volume of PBS was added to the apical chamber with either DMSO, Heparinase or or
various halofuginone concentrations. Cells were incubated at 37◦C and 5% CO2 for 4 hours.
Unbound virus was removed, the apical surface was washed and the compounds were re-added
to the apical chamber. Cells were incubated for another 20 hours at 37◦C and 5% CO2. After
inoculation, cells were washed once with PBS-/- and 100 µl TrypLE (ThermoFisher) was added
to the apical chamber then incubated for 10 min in the incubator. Cells were gently pipetted up
and down and transferred into a sterile 15 ml conical tube containing neutralizing medium of
DMEM + 3% FBS. TrypLE was added again for 3 rounds of 10 minutes for a total of 30 min to
clear transwell membrane. Cells were spun down and resuspended in PBS with Zombie UV
viability dye for 15 min in room temp. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer then fixed in 4%
PFA for 30 min at room temp. PFA was washed off and cells were resuspended in PBS.

Virus plaque assays
Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 or Hep3B cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of
0.1. After one hour of incubation at 37 °C, the virus was removed, and the medium was replaced.
After 48 hr, cell culture supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C. Virus titers were
determined by plaque assays on Vero E6 monolayers. In short, serial dilutions of virus stocks in
Dulbecco’s Modified Essential Media (DMEM) (Corning, #10-014-CV) were added to Vero E6
monolayers on 12-well plates and incubated 1 hr at 37 °C with rocking every 10-15 min. The cells

were subsequently overlaid with MEM containing 0.6% agarose (ThermoFisher Scientific,
#16500-100), 4% FBS, non-essential amino acids, L glutamine, and sodium bicarbonate and the
plates were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air for 48 hr. The plates
were fixed with a mixture of 10% formaldehyde and 2% methanol (v/v in PBS) for 24 hr. Agarose
overlays were removed, and the monolayer was washed once with PBS and stained with 0.025%
Crystal Violet prepared in 2% ethanol. After 15 min, Crystal Violet was removed, and plaques
were counted to determine the virus titers. Plaque assays were performed and counted by a
blinded experimenter. All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in Biosafety Level-3 conditions
either at the University of California San Diego or at the Eva J Pell Laboratory, The Pennsylvania
State University, following the guidelines approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committees.

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR:
RNA was purified from TRIzol lysates using Direct-zol RNA Microprep kits (Zymo Research)
according to manufacturer recommendations that included DNase treatment. RNA was converted
to cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) and qPCR was performed using iTaq
universal SYBR green supermix (BioRad) and an ABI 7300 real-time pcr system. cDNA was
amplified using the following primers RPLP0 F – GTGTTCGACAATGGCAGCAT; RPLP0 R –

Formaldehyde fixed cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized for immunofluorescence
using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm according to the manufacturers protocol for fixed cells and stained for
SARS-CoV-2 with a primary anti-Nucleocapsid antibody (GeneTex GTX135357) followed by a
secondary Goat anti Rabbit AF594 antibody (ThermoFisher A-11037) and nuclei stained with
Sytox Green. Five or eight images per well were obtained using an Incucyte S3 (Sartorius) or
Nikon Ti2-E microscope equipped with a Qi-2 camera and Lumencor Spectra III light engine
respectively. The percent infected cells were calculated using built-in image analysis tools for the
Incucyte S3. For images acquired with the Nikon Ti2, images were analysed using the Fiji
distribution of ImageJ (PMID 22743772) and the DeepLearning plugin StarDist (Schmidt et al,
2012 – see below) as follows. Channels were separated and the Sytox Green-stained nuclei were
segmented using StarDist to generate individual masks for each nucleus. The AF594 channel
(Nucleocapsid) was selected by removing background with a rolling ball of 50 pixels. A median
filter (sigma=10) was applied to facilitate easier thresholding of AF594 signal. The resulting image
was thresholded and a mask was generated representing all positive staining. Positive nuclei
were selected by firstly eroding the StarDist generated nuclei mask by 2 pixels to reduce potential
overlap with non-positive stain. Binary reconstruction was then carried out between the resulting
mask and the AF594 mask. Uwe Schmidt, Martin Weigert, Coleman Broaddus, and Gene Myers.
