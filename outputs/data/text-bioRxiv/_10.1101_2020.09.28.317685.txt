Abstract

24

The D614G substitution in the S protein is most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating

25

globally, but its effects in viral pathogenesis and transmission remain unclear. We engineered

26

SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring the D614G substitution with or without nanoluciferase. The

27

D614G variant replicates more efficiency in primary human proximal airway epithelial cells and

28

is more fit than wildtype (WT) virus in competition studies. With similar morphology to the WT

29

virion, the D614G virus is also more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Infection

similar titers in respiratory tissue and pulmonary disease. However, the D614G variant exhibited

significantly faster droplet transmission between hamsters than the WT virus, early after

infection. Our study demonstrated the SARS-CoV2 D614G substitution enhances infectivity,

replication fitness, and early transmission.

Main text

37

The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute

38

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in an unprecedented impact

39

on human society. Since its emergence in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread

40

worldwide, causing > 26 million cases and >900 thousand deaths as of early September 2020.

41

Compared to SARS-CoV (2003 to 2004) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

42

(MERS-CoV) infection (2012 to present), SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a broader spectrum of

43

acute and chronic disease manifestations and exhibits greater transmissibility. Many patients

44

develop asymptomatic or mild disease, but some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop

45

severe lower respiratory infections that can progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome

46

(ARDS),

47

hyperinflammatory shock syndrome (1–3). Ciliated cells in the respiratory epithelium and type 2

48

pneumocyte in the alveoli are the major targets of SARS-CoV-2 (4). Viral entry is mediated by

49

the interaction between viral spike (S) glycoprotein and host receptor angiotensin-converting

50

enzyme 2 (ACE2). To date, enormous efforts have focused on developing vaccines and

51

therapeutic antibodies targeting the S protein using early ancestral isolates that have been

52

replaced by novel contemporary strains (5, 6).

57

glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 strains that is now the most prevalent form globally. Patients

58

infected with the D614G-bearing SARS-CoV-2 are associated with higher viral loads in the

59

upper respiratory tract, but not altered disease severity (5, 9). SARS-CoV2 S pseudotyped

60

viruses encoding the D614G mutation were reported to exhibit increased infectivity in

61

continuous cells lines and increased sensitivity to neutralization (5, 10). Structural analyses also

62

revealed that the receptor binding domains (RBD) in the G614-form S protein occupy a higher

63

percentage in the open conformation than the D614-form, implying an improved ability to bind to

64

ACE2 receptor (11, 12). However, the D614G substitution has yet to be evaluated in the

65

authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection models, and its function in viral pathogenesis and

66

transmissibility remains unclear.

67
68

Previously, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system based on the WA1 strain and

69

developed primary human airway epithelial cells, human ACE2 transgenic mice, and golden

70

Syrian hamsters as SARS-CoV-2 infection models (4, 13, 14). To address the function of the

71

D614G substitution in SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmissibility, we generated an isogenic

72

variant containing the D614G mutation in the S glycoprotein, along with a second variant that

73

contained the nanoLuciferease (nLuc) gene in place of the accessory gene 7a (Fig 1A). To

74

examine whether the D614G substitution enhanced authentic SARS-CoV-2 entry, four

75

susceptible cell lines were infected with wildtype (WT)-nLuc and D614G-nLuc viruses at an MOI

76

of 0.1. After a 1h incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and cultured in medium

77

containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies to prevent viral spreading. Luciferase signals

78

representing initial entry events were measured at 8h post infection (Fig. 1B). In accord with

79

pseudovirus studies (5, 6), the D614G-nLuc infection resulted in a 0.5 to 2-fold higher transgene

80

expression as compared with WT-nLuc virus. Replication kinetics comparing WT and D614G

81

viruses were performed utilizing multi-step growth curves in cell lines (Fig 1C). Although the

82

D614G variant showed similar or slightly higher titers at the early time point (8h), its peak titers

83

were significantly lower than the WT virus in Vero-E6 and A549-ACE2 cell lines but not in Vero-

84

81 and Huh7. These data suggest that the D614G substitution may modesty enhances SARS-

85

CoV-2 entry and replication in some immortalized cell lines.

86
87

Primary human airway epithelial cells from different regions of the human respiratory tract

88

display different susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the nasal epithelium being most

89

susceptible (4). To evaluate the replication of SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant in the human

90

respiratory tract, we compared WT and the D614G growth kinetics in primary human nasal

91

epithelial (HNE) from five donors, large (proximal) airway epithelial (LAE) from four donors, and

92

distal lung small airway epithelial (SAE) cells from three donors. Cultures from the same donor

93

were infected with either WT or D614G virus in triplicate (Fig. 1D to E, S1A to 1B). Both viruses

94

infect mainly ciliated cells in the primary pulmonary cultures (Fig. S1C). Paired t-test analysis

95

suggests the D614G-infected HNE at 24, 48 and 72h, and LAE cultures at 48h exhibited

96

significantly higher titers than cultures infected with the WT virus. This enhancement was not

97

observed in any timepoints in distal lung SAE cultures derived from three donors. To further

98

compare the replication fitness between the two variants in the human airway epithelia,

99

competitive co-infection assays were performed in LAE cultures infected simultaneously with

100

both viruses (Fig. 1G). After three continuous passages at 72h intervals, the D614G variant

101

became dominant in the cultures regardless of whether the WT virus was at a 1:1 or 10:1 ratio

102

over the isogenic D614G mutant (Fig. 1H and 1I). Taken together, these data suggest the

103

D614G substitution enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication fitness in the primary epithelial cells, with

104

a marked advantage in the upper respiratory tract epithelial cells in nasal and large (proximal)

105

airway epithelia.

106
107

Next, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were performed to

108

visualize virions present on the surface of primary human airway cell cultures and did not detect

109

significant differences in virion morphology (Fig. 2A and B). The number of spike proteins on

110

projections of individual virions was also not significantly different between the two viruses (Fig.

111

2C). Further, differences in spike cleavage patterns were not observed between the two viruses

112

in western blot analysis (Fig. 2D), in contrast to observations reported from a pseudovirus study

113

(15). To compare antibody neutralization properties with reported pseudotyped virus assays

114

(10), neutralization activity was measured in 10 serum samples from D614 (WT) spike-

115

vaccinated mice using the nLuc-expressing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 encoding either WT or

116

D614G spike. The serum samples show 0.8 to 5.1-fold higher half-maximal inhibitory dilution

117

(ID50) values against the D614G virus than the WT virus, suggesting the D614G substitution

118

rendered SARS-CoV-2 more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 2E and 2F). In addition,

119

six SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding neutralizing antibodies were evaluated and exhibited no

120

significant difference in half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against both viruses.

121
122

To evaluate the function of the D614G substitution in viral pathogenesis, hACE2 transgenic

123

mice and Syrian hamsters were infected with equal plaque-forming units (PFU) of WT or D614G

124

viruses. Previously, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 mice exhibited a mild

125

disease phenotype, characterized by high viral titers in the lung but minimum weight loss and

126

undetectable nasal titers (14). Two groups of hACE2 mice infected with WT and D614G viruses

127

exhibited undetectable viral titers in nasal turbinates and similar lung viral titers at day 2 and 5

128

post infection. One mouse (1/5) from both groups exhibited detectible viral titers in the brain (Fig.

129

3A). With respect to hamster studies, lung and nasal turbinate tissues collected at day 3 and 6

130

pi exhibited similar viral titers in each group (Fig. 3B and 3C). However, the D614G-infected

131

hamsters lost modestly more body weight than those infected with the WT virus (Fig. 3D).

132

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) shows similar levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in the

133

hamster lung tissue collected at day 3, 6 and 9 from both groups (Fig. 3E, 3 G-i).

134

Histopathological examination revealed similar severe pulmonary lesion with inflammatory cell

135

infiltration in the alveolar walls and air spaces, pulmonary edema, and alveolar hemorrhage in

136

both of the hamsters on day 3, extended across larger areas on day 6, and then exhibiting

137

partial resolution by day 9 (Fig. 3F). Notably, there was no significant difference in the size of

138

the lung lesions (Fig. 3G-ii) and the histological severity (Fig. 3G-iii). Taking together, the

139

D614G substitution marginally enhances SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the hamster, but not

140

mouse models.

141
142

To evaluate the role of the D614G substitution in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory droplet

143

transmissibility, we set up eight pairs of hamsters for each virus as described previously (16).

144

Each pair comprised a naïve hamster adjacent to an infected animal 1 day after infection (Fig.

145

S2). Viral titers in the nasal wash samples from both infected and exposed animals were

146

measured. Both WT and D614G were transmitted efficiently to naive hamsters evident by

147

positive nasal wash samples detected in all exposed animals at day 4 (Fig. 3H). The infected

148

groups at all three timepoints and the exposure groups at 4 and 6 dpi exhibit similar viral titers

149

between WT and D614G viruses. However, five of eight hamsters exposed to the D614G-

150

infected group showed infection and detectable viral shedding at day 2 while those exposed to

151

the WT-infected group had no infection and viral shedding (p = 0.0256, Fisher exact test).

152

These data suggest the D614G variant transmits significantly faster than the WT virus through

153

droplets and aerosols between hamsters.

154
155

Emerging viruses, like Sarbecoviruses, Alphaviruses, and Filoviruses, have undergone

156

sequential rounds of evolution while adapting to the new human hosts in epidemic or pandemic

157

settings (17–19). Among Sarbecoviruses, mutations in the Spike glycoprotein have been

158

associated with altered pathogenesis, receptor usage, and neutralization (20–22), potentially

159

challenging the development of vaccine and therapeutic antibodies that are urgently needed at

160

present. The emergent D614G mutation in the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 strains has

161

raised significant concerns about potential enhancements in transmissibility, antigenicity and/or

162

pathogenesis. Using authentic live recombinant viruses, the infectivity and fitness of D614G

163

isogenic virus were compared in primary human cells and its pathogenesis and transmissibility

164

were tested in hamsters and hACE2 mice. Our data unilaterally support a critical role for the

165

D614G mutation in enhanced virus infectivity, growth and fitness in human nasal and proximal

166

airway epithelia, but not in the lower respiratory tract airway epithelium from multiple donors.

167

These ex vivo human airway culture data are consistent with the moderately increased

168

pathogenicity, as shown by body weight changes, and improved transmission of the D614G

169

variant in the hamster models of human disease.

170
171

Using pseudotype viruses, the D614G mutation has been suggested to increase proteolytic

172

cleavage and S glycoprotein incorporation into virions, reduce S1 loss and promote enhanced

173

infectivity in vitro (5, 6, 15). Our Western blot and SEM studies demonstrated no obvious

174

differences in proteolytic processing or S incorporation into isogenic virions encoding the D614G

175

mutations, perhaps reflecting differences in S trimer incorporation and presentation between

176

authentic and pseuotyped viruses.

177

indicate that D614G alters spike trimer hydrogen-bond interactions, reorienting the RBD into an

178

“up” conformation, increasing ACE2 receptor binding and infectivity (11, 12).

179

demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 D614G recombinant viruses are significantly more infectious in

180

some continuous cells in culture, but more importantly, in multiple patient codes of nasal and

181

large airway epithelial cells derived from the upper respiratory, but not lower respiratory tract.

182

Direct competition experiments also demonstrate that the SARS-CoV2 D614G isogenic virus

183

displays a significant advantage following passage in primary human large airway epithelial cells

184

in vitro. Together, these data strongly support the role of the nasal epithelium and the D614G

185

mutation in enhanced infectivity and transmission in human populations (9). These findings are

However, our data are consistent with recent studies

186

consistent with the preferential transmission of throat SARS-CoV-2 microvariants, over sputum

187

microvatiants in human transmission chains and in influenza virus infected ferrets (23).

188
189

Patients infected with the D614G variant could not be conclusively linked to increased disease

190

severity in humans (5, 9). The hACE2 transgenic mouse study demonstrated equivalent virus

191

titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates. In contrast, the isogenic D614G recombinant virus

192

infection of hamsters resulted in significant differences in weight loss, but not pathology or virus

193

replication in the lung and nasal turbinates. In transmission studies, the D614G isogenic was

194

transmitted significantly faster to adjacent animals early in infection, demonstrating that the

195

substitution preserved efficient transmission phenotypes in vivo. As SARS-CoV2 replicates

196

preferentially in the nasal and olfactory epithelium, characterized by subtle differences driven by

197

differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 cell type specific expression patterns across species (4, 24,

198

25), all of these data are consistent with a model of increased replication in the nasal epithelium

199

and large airway epithelium, leading to enhanced virus growth and earlier transmissibility.

200
201

The effect of the D614G variant on vaccine efficacy has been of major concern. Consistent with

202

previous studies (10), we demonstrated the increased sensitivity of the SARS-CoV2 D614G-

203

nLuc variant to the antisera from D-form spike (WT) vaccinated mice. Similar findings have been

204

reported using sera from ChAd-vaccinated mice (26). Together with similar neutralization

205

properties against six SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, these data suggest that the current vaccine and mAb

206

approaches directed against WT spike should be effective against the D614G strains. In

207

addition, these data support the hypothesis that early in the pandemic S-trimer reorganization

208

favors transmission over-sensitivity to neutralization, a phenotype that might be expected to

209

emerge as a new virus spreads through a large naive population and then undergoes new

210

evolutionary change as herd immunity increase with time.

212

In summary, our data support the critical need to periodically review SARS-CoV-2 contemporary

213

isolates across the globe and identify the emergence of new variants with increased

214

transmission and pathogenesis and/or altered antigenicity, especially as levels of human herd

215

immunity and interventions alter the selective forces that operate on the genome. Our data

216

suggest that vaccines encoding the ancestral D614 S glycoprotein will elicit robust neutralization

217

titers against contemporary G614 isolates, supporting continued development of existing

218

vaccine formulations.

Material and Method

366

Antibodies

367

Monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding neutralizing antibodies (nAb) B38 and H4 were

368

synthesized at UNC Protein Expression and Purification core based on previously reported

369

protein sequences (27). The nAbs S309, REGN10933, REGN10987 and JS016 were reported

370

previously (28, 29) and were kindly provided by Adimab LLC. Serum samples collected from

371

BALB/c mice vaccinated with WA1 spike protein (D-form) were generated in our laboratory

372

previously (4, 14). Monoclonal antibody targeting the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

373

was purchased from Abcam (ab272504). Polyclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV N

374

protein PA1-41098 and ANT-180 were purchased from Invitrogen and Prospec, respectively.

375

Mouse antiserum targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was produced in our laboratory

376

as described previously (14).

377
378

Cells and viruses

379

Simian kidney cell lines Vero-81 (ATCC # CCL81), Vero-E6 (ATCC # CRL1586) were

380

maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf

381

serum (FBS, Hyclone). Huh7 and A549-ACE2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified

382

Eagle Medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS. A clonal A549-ACE2 stable cell line was generated by

383

overexpressing human ACE2 in the A549 cell line (ATCC # CCL185) using the Sleeping Beauty

384

Transposon system. Generation of primary human pulmonary cell cultures was described

385

previously (4). Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNE) were collected from healthy

386

volunteers by curettage under UNC Biomedical IRB-approved protocols (#11-1363 and #98-

387

1015). Human bronchial epithelial [large airway epithelial (LAE)] and bronchiolar [small airway

epithelial (SAE)] cells were isolated from freshly excised normal human lungs obtained from

389

transplant donors with lungs unsuitable for transplant under IRB-approved protocol (#03-1396)

390

and cultured in air liquid interface (ALI) media, as previously described (4, 30). SARS-CoV-2

391

WA1 molecular clone, WT and nLuc viruses were generated previously (4, 14). To generate the

392

D614G and D614G-nLuc variants, the amino acid substation was introduced into the S gene in

393

the plasmid F and coupled with plasmid G with or without nLuc insertion in the ORF7a. Then,

394

the seven genomic cDNA fragments spanning the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome were digested,

395

purified and ligated. Full-length RNA was transcribed and electroporated into Vero E6 cells.

396

Virus stocks were verified by Sanger sequencing. All viral infections were performed under

397

biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions at negative pressure, and Tyvek suits connected with

398

personal powered-air purifying respirators.

nLuc virus entry assay

401

Monolayers of Vero-E6, Vero-81, A549-ACE2 and Huh7 cells were cultured in black-walled 96-

402

well plates (Corning 3904) overnight. The cells were infected with WT-nLuc or D614G-nLuc

403

viruses at MOI of 0.1. After incubation for 1h, inocula were removed, and the cells were washed

404

two times with PBS and maintained in DMEM containing 5% FBS and the mixture of SARS-

405

CoV-2 nAbs REGN10933, REGN10987 and JS016 at concentration of 1000 times of IC50 for

406

each. After incubation at 37

410

Vero E6 cells were plated at 20,000 cells per well in black-walled 96-well plates (Corning 3904).

411

Mouse serum samples were tested at a starting dilution of 1:20 and mAb samples were tested

412

at a starting dilution 30 to 0.1 μg/ml and were serially diluted 3-fold up to eight dilution spots.

413

Diluted antibodies or sera were mixed with 189 PFU/well WT-nLuc or D614G-nLuc virus, and

414

the mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Following incubation, growth media was

415

removed, and virus-antibody mixtures were added to the cells in duplicate. Virus-only controls

416

were included in each plate. Following infection, plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for

417

48h. After the 48h incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured via Nano-

418

Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer specifications.

419

Neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in relatively

420

light unit (RLU) was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.

421
422

WT and D614G competition assay and BstCI digestion

423

LAE cultures from one donor were infected with MOI of 0.5 of WT and D614G mixture at 1:1

424

and 10:1 ratios. Following 1h incubation, the cultures were washed three times with PBS and

425

cultures for 72h in the air-liquid interface (ALI) condition. To passage the progeny viruses,

426

100uL PBS was added to each LAE surface for 10 min incubation and was added to naïve

427

cultures surface for infection. The virus samples were continuously passaged three times in LAE

428

culture, and cellular RNA samples from the 3rd passage were extracted using TRIzol reagent

429

(Thermo Fisher). A 1547bp fragment containing the D614G site was amplified from each RNA

440

by isoflurane overdose, and tissue samples were harvested for viral titer analysis. The right

441

caudal lung lobe, brain and nasal turbinates were taken for titer and stored at -80 °C until

442

homogenized in 1mL PBS and titrated by plaque assay. Briefly, the supernatants of

443

homogenized tissue were serially diluted in PBS, 200 µL of diluted samples were added to

Whole-mount immunostaining and imaging

448

WT or D614G-infected LAE ALI cultures were fixed twice for 20 minutes in 4% formaldehyde in

449

PBS and stored in PBS. The SARS-CoV-2 N antigen was stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-

450

SARS-CoV N protein (Invitrogen PA1-41098, 0.5 ug/mL),and using species-specific secondary

451

antibodies as previously described (4). The cultures were also imaged for α-tubulin (Millipore

452

MAB1864; 3ug/mL) and MUC5AC (Thermo Scientific 45M1; 4ug/mL) as indicated. Filamentous

453

actin was localized with phalloidin (Invitrogen A22287), and nuclei was visualized with Hoechst

454

33342 staining (Invitrogen). An Olympus FV3000RS confocal microscope in Galvo scan mode

455

was used to acquire 5-channel Z stacks by 2-phase sequential scan. Representative stacks

456

were acquired and are shown as Z-projections and XZ cross sections to distinguish individual

457

cell features and to characterize the infected cell types. ImageJ was used to measure the

458

relative apical culture surface covered by multiciliated cells.

Leica UCT ultramicrotome. Ultrathin sections were collected on 200 mesh copper grids and

480

stained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds’ lead citrate. Samples were

481

observed using a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope operating at 80kV and images

482

were taken using a Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD camera (Gatan). The number of spikes on each

483

virion projection was quantified using ImageJ software. SEM images of infected cultures from 3

484

donors were imaged, at least 10 different micrographs (>100k X) were analyzed using the multi-

485

point counting tool on individual virions.

Hamster infection, tissue collection, and transmission studies

488

Hamster studies were performed in accordance with Animal Care and Use Committee

489

guidelines of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Syrian hamsters (females, 4-6 weeks old)

490

were purchased from Envigo (Madison, WI) and allowed to acclimate for a minimal of three days

at BSL-3 agriculture containment at the Influenza Research Institute (University of Wisconsin).

492

Hamsters were infected with 103 PFU of WT or D614G viruses intranasally under isoflurane

493

anesthesia. At the indicated timepoints, a subset of hamsters were euthanized by deep

494

anesthesia by isoflurane inhalation and cervical dislocation and tissues samples were harvested

495

for virus titer and histopathology analysis. Weights of one group of hamsters were recorded for

496

14 days after infection.

497
498

To evaluate indirect virus transmission between hamsters, groups of hamsters (n=8 per group)

499

were infected with 103 PFU of WT or D614G viruses intranasally under isoflurane anesthesia.

500

Infected animals were placed in specially designed cages (Figure S2B) inside an isolator unit

501

(16). Twenty-four hours later, naïve hamsters were placed in the other side of the cage with 5

502

cm separation by a double-layered divider to allow free air flow. The isolator unit provided one

503

directional airflow; therefore, the infected hamsters were placed in the front of the isolator unit.

504

Metal shroud were placed over the cages so only the front and back of the cage was open.

505

Nasal washes were collected at 3-day intervals for the infected hamsters and 2-day intervals for

506

the exposed animals starting on day 2 after infection or exposure (Figure S2A).

507
508

Pathological examination

509

Tissues fixed for at least seven days in 10% formalin were trimmed and embedded in paraffin.

510

The paraffin blocks were cut into 3 μm-thick sections and mounted on silane-coated glass slides.

511

One section from each tissue sample was stained using a standard hematoxylin and eosin

512

procedure. To detect SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein in immunohistochemistry (IHC), tissue

513

sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Prospec, ANT-180) as the primary

514

antibodies,

515

(EnVision/HRP, DAKO) as the secondary antibody. Immunostaining was visualized by 3,3’-

and
