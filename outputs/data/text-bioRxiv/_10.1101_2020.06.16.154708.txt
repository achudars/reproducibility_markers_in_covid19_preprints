Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a pressing public health
emergency garnering rapid response from scientists across the globe. Host cell invasion
is initiated through direct binding of the viral spike protein to the host receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disrupting the spike-ACE2 interaction is a
potential therapeutic target for treating COVID-19. We have developed a proximitybased AlphaLISA assay to measure binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD) to ACE2. Utilizing this assay platform, a drug-repurposing
screen against 3,384 small molecule drugs and pre-clinical compounds was performed,
yielding 25 high-quality, small-molecule hits that can be evaluated in cell-based models.
This established AlphaLISA RBD-ACE2 platform can facilitate evaluation of biologics or
small molecules that can perturb this essential viral-host interaction to further the
development of interventions to address the global health pandemic.

Introduction

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has driven an urgent need to understand the molecular
basis of infection and the consequent COVID-19 disease, and to rapidly identify
pharmacologic interventions for both preventing infection and treating infected patients.
Given that no approved therapeutics for treating any coronaviruses existed at the time
SARS-CoV-2 emerged (late 2019), early attention has focused on drug repurposing
opportunities 1, 2. Drug repurposing is an attractive approach to treating SARS-CoV-2,
as active FDA-approved drugs or unapproved drug candidates previously shown to be
safe in human clinical trials can be fast-tracked to the clinic. One such COVID-19
example is remdesivir (GS-5734, Gilead Sciences Inc.), a virus RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase inhibitor that was in Phase II clinical trials for treating Ebola virus at the time
SARS-CoV-2 emerged. Remdesivir was rapidly shown to be active against SARS-CoV2 in vitro, and progressed to clinical trials leading to the FDA granting emergency use
authorization 3. The understanding of each target and process critical for SARS-CoV-2
infection and replication will allow assays to be developed for both drug repurposing
high-through screening, and to support new therapeutic development 4.

One therapeutic target receiving significant attention is the interaction between the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Uniprot – P0DTC2) and the host protein angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2, Uniprot – Q9BYF1) 5. ACE2 is anchored to the
extracellular surface of the cell and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of
angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, part of the renin-angiotensin system. The spike

protein is exposed on the outer surface of the coronavirus particle, and has evolved to
bind to ACE2 with high affinity 6. This binding between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
ACE2 is the first step in viral infection 7, 8. The spike protein is comprises two functional
regions: the S1 region contains the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2
region being responsible for membrane fusion. Because ACE2 binding by RBD is the
first step in virus infection, preventing the interaction between Spike RBD and ACE2 is
considered a viable therapeutic strategy, and work with prior zoonotic coronaviruses
SARS and MERS has demonstrated proof-of concept for this approach 9-11. The primary
therapeutic strategy being pursued for inhibiting the spike-ACE2 interaction is the
development of selective antibodies against the spike RBD. Other approaches include
antibodies that bind to ACE2 (though these may produce side-effects) 12, development
of soluble recombinant ACE2 to compete for spike binding and limit cell entry 13, or
small molecules that directly bind to ACE2 and biophysically reduce its affinity for
binding to spike protein.

At NCATS, we are developing both protein/biochemical and cell-based assays to
interrogate a number of biological targets to enable identification of potential therapeutic
leads. Our initial focus is on performing drug repurposing screening for each assay and
rapidly sharing the data through the NCATS OpenData portal for COVID-19
(https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19) 14. As part of this effort, we sought to develop a
proximity assay for measuring the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike
RBD to facilitate the identification of small molecules and biologics that disrupt this
essential process.

AlphaLISA is a proximity-based assay that uses a pair of donor and acceptor beads to
measure interaction (or disruption) of two tagged proteins/targets of interest 15. When
the donor bead is excited by light at 680 nm it converts ambient oxygen to singlet
oxygen. If an acceptor bead is in close proximity to the singlet oxygen, it emits a
luminescent signal at 615 nm (and when this proximity is perturbed, there is a loss of
signal). As AlphaLISA is amenable to quantitative high-throughput sceeening (qHTS),
and can leverage multiple tagged ACE2 and Spike RBD constructs that are
commercially available, this methodology could prove useful as a discovery approach
for small or large molecules that inhibit infection 15, 16.

Herein we describe the development of an AlphaLISA assay using a recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD fused to a Fc tag and recombinant soluble human
ACE2 fused to a biotinylated AviTag to model a simplified spike RBD-ACE2 interaction
system. The ratio of proteins in the assay was optimized, and proof-of-concept proteinprotein disruption demonstrated using untagged ACE2 or RBD protein as competitive
inhibitors. The assay was used for a drug repurposing screen of >3K compounds, using
a library of approved small molecule drugs (the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection,
NPC) and a library of compounds with prior demonstrated anti-infective activity 17, 18. We
also screened all compounds in parallel against the TruHits counter-assay to identify
and rule out false-positive hits.

Methods
Reagents
ACE2-His-Avi (human ACE2 residues 18-740, C-terminal His-Avi tags) (Cat #
AC2H82E6) was acquired from ACROBiosystems (Newark, DE). RBD-Fc (SARS-CoV-2
spike protein residues 319-541, C-terminal Fc tag) (Cat #40592-V02H), ACE2-His
(ACE2 residues 1-740, C-terminal His tag) (Cat # 10108-H08H), and S1-His (spike
protein residues 1-667, C-terminal His tag) (Cat # 40150-V08B1) were acquired from
Sino Biological (Wayne, PA). All proteins were reconstituted in 1X PBS at pH 7.4
supplemented with 0.05 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA). Streptavidin Donor beads
(Cat # 6760002) and Protein A acceptor beads (Cat # AL101) were acquired from
PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA).

Cross-titration experiment
Concentrations of ACE2-His-Avi and RBD-Fc in the AlphaLISA assay were selected by
cross-titrating ACE2-His-Avi (300 - 0.1 nM) against RBD-Fc (300 – 0.1 nM) in 1X PBS
(pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.05 mg/mL BSA. Each concentration combination of
ACE2-His-Avi and RBD-Fc were mixed in a 384-well plate (square-well, high-base,
white, medium binding; Cat # EWB010000A, Aurora Microplates, Whitefish, MT) and
incubated at 25°C for 30 minutes. Streptavidin Donor beads and Protein A Acceptor
beads were then added to the wells using a multi-channel pipet to a final concentration
of 10 μg/mL each. AlphaLISA signal was read using a PheraSTAR (BMG Labtech,
Cary, NC) plate reader with a 384-well format focal lens equipped with an AlphaLISA
optical module (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC). The optimal concentration combination of

ACE2-His-Avi and RBD-Fc was identified by the combination that returned the highest
signal in the presence of 10 µg/mL Streptavidin Donor beads and 10 μg/mL Protein A
Acceptor beads.

Competition ACE2- and S1- binding assay
A competition assay was performed to confirm the AlphaLISA assay was sensitive the
ACE2-His-Avi interactions with RBD-Fc. ACE2-His (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA) and
S1-His (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA) are not recognized by either the Streptavidin Donor
bead nor the Protein A Acceptor bead. A gradient of ACE2-His concentrations (1 µM to
0.01 nM) were mixed with RBD-Fc (4 nM). After 30 minutes of preincubation at 25 °C
ACE2-His-Avi (4 nM) was added to the mixture and allowed to incubate at 25 °C for
another 30 minutes. A mixture of Streptavidin donor beads and Protein A acceptor
beads were then added to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL each. The resulting mixture
was incubated at 25 °C for 40 minutes before reading the AlphaLISA luminescent signal
with a PheraSTAR plate reader. S1-His competition assay was performed in the same
manner with some changes S1-His (300 nM to 0.1 nM) was mixed with ACE2-His-Avi (4
nM) and preincubated for 30 minutes at 25 °C, then RBD-Fc was introduced to the
mixture before adding beads.

AlphaLISA Screening Protocol
The AlphaLISA screening assay was performed according to the protocol in Table 1.

Data Processing and Analysis
To determine compound activity in the qHTS assay, the concentration-response data for
each sample was plotted and modeled by a four-parameter logistic fit yielding IC50 and
efficacy (maximal response) values. Raw plate reads for each titration point were first
normalized relative to positive control (-100% activity, full inhibition) and DMSO-only
wells (basal, 0% activity). Data normalization and curve fitting were performed using inhouse informatics tools. Compounds were designated as Class 1–4 according to the
type of concentration–response curve (CRC) observed 19. In brief, Class -1.1 and -1.2
were the highest-confidence complete CRCs containing upper and lower asymptotes
with efficacies ≥ 80% and < 80%, respectively. Class -2.1 and -2.2 were incomplete
CRCs having only one asymptote with efficacy ≥ 80% and < 80%, respectively. Class -3
CRCs showed activity at only the highest concentration or were poorly fit. Class 4 CRCs
were inactive having a curve-fit of insufficient efficacy or lacking a fit altogether. Data
visualization was performed using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and Spotfire
(PerkinElmer) software programs. Scheme figures were all prepared using Illustrator
(Adobe, San Jose, CA).

Results
Assay Design
We set out to develop a 1536-well plate assay capable of measuring SARS-CoV-2
spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to the ACE2 receptor. Two recombinant
protein constructs were selected to model the RBD-ACE2 interaction in vitro. A
truncated spike protein RBD (residues 319-541) fused to a C-terminal Fc tag and a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.154708; this version posted June 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

truncated soluble ACE2 (residues 18-740) fused to a C-terminal poly-His tag followed
by an AviTag (Figure 1A). These constructs were selected because the Fc tag and
AviTag form tight and specific interactions with Protein A and streptavidin, respectively,
making them ideal handles for AlphaLISA particles. When the RBD binds to ACE2 the
Fc-tag and AviTag are accessible to Protein A acceptor beads and Streptavidin donor
beads, respectively (Figure 1B). This series of interaction brings the donor and acceptor
beads into sufficient proximity to excite the donor bead at 680 nm and monitor acceptor
bead luminescence at 615 nm.

Defining Assay Parameters
We first had to determine the working concentrations of RBD-Fc and ACE2-Avi that
maximize the AlphaLISA signal. 10 µg/mL was selected for the concentration of donor
and acceptor beads because it gave good signal with minimal well-to-well cross-talk
(data not shown). To determine the optimal protein concentrations for the assay, we
performed a cross-titration of RBD-Fc and ACE2-Avi varying each from 300 nM to 0.1
nM (Figure 2A). The maximum signal was achieved at 3.7 nM of both RBD-Fc and
ACE2-Avi. Next, we tested the signal consistency of a high-signal control (ACE2-Avi +
RBD-Fc + both AlphaLISA beads) and a low-signal control (ACE2-Avi + RBD-Fc +
streptavidin donor beads) in 1536-well format (Figure 2B). At 4 nM of ACE2-Avi, 4 nM
RBD-Fc, and 10 µg/mL of both streptavidin donor beads and Protein A acceptor beads
we determined a plate Z` value of 0.73 and signal-to-background of 286.7, indicating
satisfactory assay performance.

Next we wanted to confirm the AlphaLISA signal measured was dependent on
the RBD-Fc interaction with ACE2-Avi (i.e., the assay is ‘inhibitable’). We tested the
ability of a truncated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a C-terminal poly-His tag to
compete with RBD-Fc for ACE2 binding, and a soluble ACE2 with a C-terminal poly-His
tag to compete with ACE2-Avi for RBD binding. These constructs were selected
because both the S1-His and ACE2-His constructs should recognize their respective
binding partner, ACE2-Avi and RBD-Fc, but will not be engaged by the AlphaLISA
beads. Indeed, both S1-His and ACE2 were able to compete with their respective
binding partners in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C, D), indicating that the
AlphaLISA assay is dependent on RBD-ACE2 interaction, and therefore ‘inhibitable’.

qHTS screen of NPC and AIL compounds sets
Having established the conditions and suitable performance for the RBD-ACE2
AlphaLISA assay, we employed it for qHTS. To this end we selected two libraries: the
NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC, small-molecule library of approved drugs in
the USA, Europe and Japan, 2,678 compounds), and an in-house anti-infectives library
(AIL, compounds shown to be active against infectious diseases, 739 compounds) to
screen against our AlphaLISA RBD-ACE2 binding assay (HTS assay protocol shown in
Table 1). When screening the NPC library the average plate Z` was 0.77 with an
average signal-to-background of 108.5 (Figure 3A). The AIL collection screen had an
average plate Z` of 0.90 and signal-to-background of 460.7 (Figure 3B). Both NPC and
AIL were also screened in parallel against the TruHits counter-assay platform to rule out
false-positive hits (Figure 1C, TruHits HTS protocol displayed in Table 2). For NPC, the

TruHits counter-assay performed with an average Z` of 0.93 and average signal-tobackground of 15477 (Figure 3C) and the AIL had an average Z` of 0.94 with an
average signal-to-background of 17,410 (Figure 3D).

Hit Identification
Hit compounds for both the AlphaLISA primary assay and the TruHits counter screen
were identified as those with an IC50 < 50 µM and a maximum efficacy ≥ -50%,
effectively removing all class -4 and some class -3 compounds (see Methods for curve
class designations). A total of 574 initial hits were identified for the AlphaLISA assay
(16.9% hit rate) and a total of 624 initial hits for the TruHits counter-assay (18.4% hit
rate, Figure 4). 89 of these initial hits were unique to the AlphaLISA assay forming our
first pool of potential active compounds. High-quality hits were then selected by visual
inspection of the dose-response curves (Figure 5). 25 compounds were identified as
high-quality hits capable of disrupting RBD-ACE2 binding (Table 3).

Discussion
We developed the first well-based proximity assay for measuring COVID19
ACE2-RBD interactions using AlphaLISA technology. The AlphaLISA approach has the
advantages of high signal-to-background, robust assay performance (Z` values), and is
widely applicable to a variety of therapeutic types (small molecules, nanobodies,
peptides, etc.). Molecules which interfere with the generation of or those that scavenge
singlet oxygen present a problem as do those which absorb or emit light in the 615-680
nm wavelengths 20. However, the ease of use and ability to rapidly deploy an assay

using this platform positions it as a strong primary assay for therapeutic screenings.
Furthermore, the availability of the TruHits counter-screen simplifies the identification of
most false-positive compounds.
While TruHits cannot account for the Protein A-Fc interaction used in our
AlphaLISA assay, it does aid in funneling down the potential hits to numbers that are
more manageable for lower through-put approaches. Our screen identified 25 highquality hits that were not active in the counter-assay (Table 3). While there was no
expectation of a clinical drug repurposing opportunity emerging from the screen, the hit
compounds include several compounds approved for treating patients. A number of
molecules containing PAINS moieties such as phenolics appear in Table 1 including the
top hit corilagin (a polyphenolic natural product), and careful follow-up would be
required to understand mechanism. Nevertheless, the assay can serve to support the
identification (HTS) or optimization of small molecule & protein-based therapeutic
candidate molecules directed to specifically inhibit the ACE2-spike interaction.
SARS-CoV-2 follows its predecessor, SARS-CoV, by using its spike protein to
engage host ACE2 receptors to invade host cells. In response to the SARS-CoV
outbreak in 2003 efforts targeting the ACE2-spike interaction emphasized antibodybased therapeutics 21, 22. Phage display libraries 10, 11 and surface plasmon resonance 23
were used to develop neutralizing peptides. However, reported small molecule screens
for SARS-CoV at the time focused on target-agnostic cellular approaches 24. Focused
protein-protein interaction (PPI, proximity) assays were not widely available for
screening in 2003. Advances in screening technology over the past decades, such as

the AlphaLISA technology used in this assay, enable us to address specific aspects of
COVID19 biology on a scale that was inaccessible during previous outbreaks.
Currently, protein-protein interaction assays have been used to determine vital
information about ACE2-Spike interactions 7, 8, but the methods used (ITC and SPR) are
low throughput. At the time of writing, protein-protein interaction assays for ACE2-spike
binding have not yet been published, nor had any HTS with ACE2-spike proximity assay
approaches. The commercial availability of orthogonal PPI methods using fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET), saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, Coimmunoprecipitation, and microscale thermophoresis support the need for further
development of such assays and broad interest of the scientific community.
The AlphaLISA assay we developed presents a quick, simple, and qHTSamenable approach to ACE2-RBD therapeutic development. However, we are
presenting an early assay and orthogonal approaches being developed at NCATS and
across the globe can only serve to improve our ability to develop and test COVID19
therapeutics. Indeed, one aspect of ACE2-spike binding we cannot capture in our assay
is the role of biological multimerization. Recently multimerization of ACE2 and spike
have been demonstrated to enhance the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike and
host ACE2 25. Future assay development could emphasize the use of additional
recombinant protein constructs to more closely model the biological ACES-spike
interaction. The advantage to AlphaLISA is that we can continue to use the methods
developed herein toward more sophisticated qHTS assay design to suit our evolving
knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology.

ACE2-RBD binding. B) AlphaLISA assay system used to monitor ACE2-RBD interacts.
Streptavidin donor beads recognize the Avi tag on ACE2. Protein A acceptor beads
recognize the Fc tag on RBD. When in proximity the donor beads can be excited with
light at 680 nm. This generates singlet oxygen which diffuses to the acceptor beads,
causing the acceptor beads to luminesce at 615 nm. C) The TruHits counter-screen uses
strep donor beads which directly interact with biotin acceptor beads. Because no
intermediary molecule is needed to bring the donor and acceptor beads in proximity, the
TruHits assay can identify compounds which directly interfere with the AlphaLISA
readout.

Figure 2: The AlphaLISA assay monitors ACE2-RBD interactions. A) ACE2-Avi and RBDFc were titrated against each other from 300 – 0.1 nM in matrix format to determine the
optimal protein concentrations for the AlphaLISA assay. ACE2-Avi and RBD-Fc were
mixed at the concentrations indicated and allowed to equilibrate at 25°C for 30 minutes.
Streptavidin Donor beads and Protein A Acceptor beads were then introduced to the
solutions to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL of each bead. After 40 minutes of incubation
at 25°C the signal intensity was read using a PheraStar plate reader. B) Assay suitability
to 1536-well format was determined by combining 4 nM ACE2-Avi with 4 nM RBD-Fc in
PBS + 0.05 mg/mL BSA. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 minutes. Streptavidin
donor beads (10 µg/mL) were added to columns 1-8 of a 1536-well plate. Protein A
acceptor beads (10 µg/mL) were added to columns 5-8. The entire mixture was incubated
at 25°C for 40 minutes before reading the low-signal control (columns 1-4) and high-signal
control (columns 5-8) using a PheraSTAR plate reader with an AlphaLISA module. Z` and
signal-to-background (S:B) were calculated from these sample measurements. C, D) To
confirm the AlphaLISA signal related to ACE2-RBD interactions, we tested the ability of
His-S1 (another form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein) and untagged ACE2 to lower the
AlphaLISA signal in a dose-dependent manner. C) His-S1 was mixed in dose-response
with 4 nM ACE2-Avi and allowed to incubate at 25°C for 30 minutes before adding 4 nM
RBD-Fc. D) Untagged ACE2 was pre-incubated in dose-response with 4 nM RBD-Fc and
allowed to incubate at 25°C for 30 minutes before adding 4 nM ACE2-Avi. Both His-S1
and untagged ACE2 showed dose-dependent signal loss, indicating the AlphaLISA signal
is mediated by RBD-Fc binding to ACE2-Avi.

Figure 4: Hit summary from NPC and AIL compound sets. AlphaLISA and TruHits assays
were performed against the NPC and AIL compound sets (3,384 compounds total).
Potential hits in both the AlphaLISA and TruHits assays were defined as having an IC50
≥ 50 µM and a maximum response ≤ -50%. 89 of those hits were found to be unique to
the AlphaLISA assay and those curves were visually inspected to identify 25 high-quality
hits. Low-quality hits have TruHits response curves that satisfy the conditions for a
“potential hit” but do not significantly diverge from the AlphaLISA data. High-quality hits
have minimal TruHits response which do significantly diverge from the AlphaLISA
response curve.

Figure 5: Example dose-response curves showing criteria for hit selections. Biotin is a
true false positive active in the AlphaLISA and TruHits assays. Adaptavir, a true negative,
was active in neither AlphaLISA nor TruHits Assays. E7449 is a low-quality hit satisfies
initial hit identification parameters (IC50 ≤ 50 µM and a maximum response ≥50%) but
upon visual inspection we see the TruHits data barely miss the initial hit parameters, thus
E7449 is not a high-quality hit. Cangrelor is an example of a high-quality hit that satisfies
both initial hit identification parameters and passes visual inspection.

Table 3. Curated compound actives from the NPC and Anti-Infectives libraries after
filtering for assay-interfering compounds. 25 compounds with various MOAs showed
weak activity as inhibitors of the ACE2-RBD interaction.
