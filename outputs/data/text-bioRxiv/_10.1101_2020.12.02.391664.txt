Abstract
A striking feature of severe COVID-19 is thrombosis in large as well as small vessels of multiple organs.
This has led to the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects and damages the vascular
endothelium. However, endothelial expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, has not
been convincingly demonstrated. Interrogating human bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data, we
found ACE2 expression in endothelial cells to be extremely low or absent in vivo and not upregulated
by exposure to inflammatory agents in vitro. Also, the endothelial chromatin landscape at the ACE2
locus showed presence of repressive and absence of activation marks, suggesting that the gene is
inactive in endothelial cells. Finally, we failed to achieve infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in
cultured human endothelial cells, which were permissive to productive infection by coronavirus 229E
that uses CD13 as the receptor. Our data suggest that SARS-Cov-2 is unlikely to infect endothelial cells
directly; these findings are consistent with a scenario where endothelial injury is indirectly caused by

the infection of neighbouring epithelial cells and/or due to systemic effects mediated by immune cells,
platelets, complement activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokines.

Introduction
A striking feature of severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the current pandemic
caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is severe endothelial injury with micro- and macro-thrombotic
disease in the lung and other organs, including the heart. This has led to speculation that viral infection
may damage the endothelium through two mechanisms: indirectly, via neighbourhood effects,
circulating mediators and immune mechanisms, or directly by viral infection of endothelial cells (EC).
To support the hypothesis of direct viral damage of EC via virus-induced infection, the cells should
express the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a
metalloproteinase component of the renin-angiotensin hormone system and a critical regulator of
cardiovascular homeostasis1. Indeed, several recent review articles propose that SARS-CoV-2 binding
to ACE2 on EC is the mechanism through which the virus may cause direct endothelial damage and
endothelialitis1. However, expression of ACE2 in EC has not been convincingly demonstrated to
support this assumption, nor has there been sufficient evidence to support a direct infection of EC by
SARS-CoV-2.

Results and Discussion
To address the questions of ACE2 expression in human EC and of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect
the endothelium, we interrogated transcriptomic and epigenomic data on human EC and studied the
interaction and replication of SARS-Cov-2 and its viral proteins with EC in vitro. Analysis of RNA-seq
was carried out on ENCODE# data from EC from arterial, venous and microvascular beds, in comparison
with epithelial cells from respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin sources. Very low or no basal ACE2
expression was found in EC, compared to epithelial cells (Figure A-B). Moreover, in vitro exposure of
EC to inflammatory cytokines reported as elevated in the plasma of patients with severe COVID-19
failed to upregulate ACE2 expression (Figure C).
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) of human organ donor hearts2 showed that while ACE2
sequence reads are abundant in pericytes (PC), they are rare in EC (Figure D). Out of 100,579 EC, only
468 (0,47%) were ACE2+, and in the majority (424) only a single ACE2 transcript was detected. This
could reflect true low and rare endothelial ACE2 expression, but also contamination from adherent PC
fragments, a common confounder in vascular scRNAseq data3. If such fragments contributed the ACE2
transcripts observed in certain EC, we would expect to detect other pericyte transcripts in the same
cells. Indeed, among the top-50 gene transcripts enriched in ACE2+ vs. ACE2- EC, we noticed several
known pericyte markers, including PDGFRB, ABCC9, KCNJ8 and RGS5 (Figure E). Comparison of
transcript abundance across the three major vascular and mesothelial cells showed that the top-50
gene transcripts were expressed at the highest levels in PC (Figure E). This suggests that the rare
occurrence of ACE2 transcripts in human heart EC is likely caused by pericyte contamination. Similar
conclusions have previously been reached in mouse tissues3 .
Analysis of the chromatin landscape at the ACE2 gene locus in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) using
data from ENCODE further supports this concept. The histone modification mark H3K27me3, which
indicates repressed chromatin, was enriched at the ACE2 transcription start site (TSS); conversely,
promoter, enhancer and gene body activation marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3,

H3K36me3), RNA polymerase-II and DNase I hypersensitivity were absent or low, suggesting that ACE2
is inactive in EC. In marked contrast, the adjacent gene BMX, an endothelial-restricted non-receptor
tyrosine kinase displays an epigenetic profile consistent with active endothelial expression (Figure F).
Thus, transcriptomic and epigenomic data indicate that ACE2 is not expressed in human EC.
Other cell surface molecules have been suggested as possible receptors for the virus, but their role in
supporting SARS-CoV-2 cell infection remains to be demonstrated. We therefore tested directly
whether EC could be capable of supporting coronavirus replication in vitro. Productive levels of
replication in primary human cardiac and pulmonary EC were observed for the human coronavirus
229E GFP reporter virus4, which utilises CD13 as its receptor, demonstrating directly that human EC
can support coronavirus replication in principle (Figure G). However, when cells were exposed to SARSCoV-2, replication levels were extremely low for EC, even following exposure to very high
concentrations of virus compared to more permissive VeroE6 cells (Figure H). The observed low levels
of SARS-CoV-2 replication in EC are likely explained by viral entry via a non-ACE2 dependent route,
due to exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of virus in these experiments (MOI 10 and 100).
These data indicate that direct endothelial infection by SARS-Cov-2 is not likely to occur. The
endothelial damage reported in severely ill COVID19 patients is more likely secondary to infection of
neighbouring cells and/or other mechanisms, including immune cells, platelets and complement
activation, and circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Our hypothesis is corroborated by recent
evidence that plasma from critically ill and convalescent patients with COVID-19 causes endothelial
cell cytotoxicity5. These finding have implications for the therapeutic approaches to tackle vascular
damage in severe COVID19 disease.

Materials and methods
Whole-transcriptome analysis with total RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
RNA-seq data files with gene quantifications for primary human epithelial and endothelial cells were
downloaded from the ENCODE database (www.encodeproject.org)6, using Bioconductor package
“ENCODEExplorer” and R. For consistency, only total RNAseq data generated by the same source,
“Thomas Gingeras, CSHL”, and aligned to GrCh38 reference genome were included in the analysis. Cell
types with one replicate were excluded. Raw counts were converted to counts per million (CPM),
filtered based on expression, log2 transformed and normalized with Trimmed Mean of M-value (TMM)
method using Bioconductor package “EdgeR”. Only genes with more than 0.3 counts per million (CPM)
in at least three samples were kept for the analysis (19360 genes).

Endothelial cell cytokine treatments and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Lonza C2519A) were cultured in Endothelial
Cell Growth Medium-2 media (EGM-2) (Lonza). HUVEC were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/963

well plate in EGM-2 supplemented with recombinant human TNF-α (300-01A, PeproTech EC Ltd),
IL1-β (200-01B, PeproTech EC Ltd), IL8 (72aa, monocytes derived, 200-08M, PeproTech EC Ltd) and
IL-6/IL-6R Alpha Protein Chimera (8954-SR, R&D Biotechne) at 0, 0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 ng/ml for 4 or 24
hours. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA
using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
using PerfeCTa SYBR Green Fastmix (Quanta Biosciences) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 system. Gene
expression values were normalized to GAPDH expression. Sequences of the human primers used in
this study are listed below: GAPDH forward: 5’-CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTG-3’ and GAPDH
reverse: 5’-GGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCTG-3’; ACE2 forward: 5’-ACAGTCCACACTTGCCCAAAT-3’ and ACE2
reverse: 5’-TGAGAGCACTGAAGACCCATT-3’.
Human heart single cell RNAseq data analysis
Human heart single cell raw counts data and the cell annotation meta data were obtained from a
recent published study2. The data were processed using Seurat package (version: 3.1.1) in R. The
endothelial cells which contain ACE2 reads were grouped as ACE2+ EC cells, and the rest as ACE2- EC
cells. The genes enriched in ACE2+ EC cells were identified using FindMarkers function in Seurat. It
applies a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and then performs Bonferroni-correction using all genes in the
dataset. The corrected p value < 0.05 was used as cutoff for significance. To visualize the top 50 genes
among different cell groups, the DotPlot function was applied. The size of the dot represents
percentage of cells expressing the gene and color represents the scaled average expression levels.
Epigenetic analysis of chromatin state
Genome-wide ChIP-seq data for histone modifications and DNase I hypersensitivity in HUVEC were
obtained from the ENCODE6/Broad Institute under GEO accession number GSE29611. ChIP-seq reads
were mapped to the human reference genome GRCh37/hg19. Tracks were visualized using the UCSC
Genome Browser database (https://genome.ucsc.edu). HUVEC chromatin-state discovery and
genome annotation was obtained using ChromHMM7 from ENCODE.
Viral replication assays
HCoV-229E
Stocks of HCoV-229E GFP reporter virus described by Cervantes-Barragan et al4 were generated
following cultivation on the HUH7 cell line. HPAEC (Lonza) and HCAEC (Promocell) were seeded in 96
well plates (2.1x104 cells/cm2) 24 hours prior to infection with HCoV-229E-GFP at MOI = 0.6. Virus
inoculum was then replaced 1 hour later with 100ul fresh media before incubation at 34°C/5%CO2.
GFP fluorescence was measured every 2 hours from 20 to 58 hours post inoculation using the
ClarioStar plate reader (BMG).
SARS-CoV-2
A sample from a confirmed COVID-19 patient was collected by a trained healthcare professional using
combined nose-and-throat swabbing. The sample was stored in virus transport medium prior to
cultivation and isolation on Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cells. Samples were obtained anonymised by
coding, compliant with Tissue Governance for the South East Scotland Scottish 279 Academic Health
Sciences Collaboration Human Annotated BioResource (reference no. SR1452). Virus sequence was
confirmed by Nanopore sequencing according to the ARCTIC network protocol
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019), amplicon set V3, and validated against the patient isolate
sequence. For the virus isolate used in this project is EDB-2 (Scotland/EDB1827/2020, UK lineage 109,
B 1.5) genetic stability was observed up to 5 passages on Vero E6 cells, with particular attention to the

S1/S2 furin cleavage site. HCAEC (Promocell) and HPAEC (Lonza) were seeded in a 12-well plate
(2.0x104 cells/cm2) one day prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 EDB-2, passage 2, at MOI = 100 or 10
(assessed by endpoint titration on Vero E6 cells). At 0, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) 10 µl of
supernatant was lysed in VL buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300mM NaCl, 2.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 1:200
RNAsin Plus). The lysate was analysed by RT-qPCR, using GoTaq 1-Step RT-qPCR (Promega) with the
SARS-CoV-2 CDC N3 primers (F – GGGAGCCTTGAATACACCAAAA, R – TGTAGCACGATTGCAGCATTG) at
350nM each to determine viral copy number. To assess viral copy numbers, resulting Cts were
analysed against a standard curve of lysate with known TCID50/ml value as well as an RNA template.

Figure: Analysis of ACE2 expression in human endothelial cells and of coronavirus replication in
primary human endothelial cells.
(A-B) Comparison of ACE2 expression in human primary epithelial and endothelial cells using total
RNA-seq data from the ENCODE Database shows low or absent expression in EC. (A) The difference
of ACE2 expression in epithelial and in endothelial cells is shown in boxplots with individual, as well as
grouped samples (inner boxplot). Each dot represents a single sample (n=2 per cell type). (B)
Transcriptome profiles of epithelial and endothelial cells are shown in a density plot, using median of
all samples per group (n=19360 genes). ACE2 expression in each group is marked with a dotted line:
ACE2 expression in endothelial cells (red) overlaps with the peak for non-expressed transcripts, while
ACE2 expression in epithelial cells (blue) is to the right, indicating detectable expression. Expression
values in all plots are represented in log2 transformed counts per million normalized by Trimmed
Mean of M-value (Log2 CPM, blue: epithelial, red: endothelial). (C) ACE2 expression is not regulated
by inflammatory cytokines in HUVEC. qPCR analysis of ACE2 mRNA expression in HUVEC treated with
a mix of 4 cytokines/chemokines (TNF-α IL - IL8 and IL6/IL6R chimeric protein) for 4h or 24h at 0,
0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 ng/ml. Data are normalized to GAPDH and presented as mean ± SEM of 3 independent
experiments. (D-E) Very low-level, rare and likely contaminating ACE2 transcripts are seen in EC. (D)
ACE2 transcript reads are detected preferentially in PC. UMAP landscapes of human heart (ref 2)
including 100,579 endothelial cells (EC), 77,856 pericytes (PC), 16,242 smooth muscle cells (SMC) and
718 mesothelial cells (MC). ACE2 transcript reads are detected preferentially in the PC cluster
(enriching for ABCC9) and are rare in the EC cluster (enriching for PECAM1). (E) PC transcripts are
enriched together with ACE2 in 0.47% of EC. Dot plot displaying the abundance of top-50 transcripts
enriched ACE2+ vs. ACE2- EC, across cell types indicated in D. (The Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests with
Bonferroni-corrected p values are < 1E-60 for each). (F) Epigenetic profiling indicates that the ACE2
gene is inactive in EC. ChIP-seq binding profiles in HUVEC for histone modifications, RNA Pol2
enrichment and DNAse I hypersensitivity. The x axis represents the genomic position, the transcription
start sites are indicated by closed arrows and the direction of transcription is indicated by open arrows;
the y axis shows ChIP-seq signal in reads per million per base pair (rpm/bp). Chromatin state

cells shows no replication of SARS-CoV-2. (G) Viral replication curves in human pulmonary (HPAEC)
and cardiac (HCAEC) endothelial cells following infection with HCoV-229E GFP reporter virus (MOI =
0.6). Virus replication was measured via GFP fluorescence every 2 hours from 20 to 58 hours post
inoculation. Mean ±SEM of 3 technical replicates are shown at each time point for each biological
replicate. (H) Viral growth curves in HPAEC (n=3), HCAEC (n=3), and Vero cells (n=1) following infection
with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI = 10 or 100. Supernatant were collected at 1, 24, and 48 hours post infection
and virus copy number quantified by RT-qPCR detection of the SARS-CoV-2 N3 gene. TCID= tissue
