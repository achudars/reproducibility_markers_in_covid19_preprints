Abstract
In this work, we present a unified and robust classification scheme for coronaviruses
based on concatenated protein clusters. This subsequently allowed us to infer the
apparent “horizontal gene transfer” events via reconciliation with the corresponding
gene trees, which we argue can serve as a marker for cross-host transmissions. The
cases of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. Our study provides
a possible technical route to understand how coronaviruses evolve and are transmitted
to humans.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family
Coronaviridae (1), and consist of four genera, i.e., alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltacoronaviruses, as classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) (2-5). All CoVs characterized so far are known to only infect vertebrates, and
lead to various zoonotic diseases. Among them, three beta-CoVs are responsible for
three major outbreaks of this century (6-10), i.e., the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the ongoing global
COVID-19 pandemic. Several alpha-CoVs and gamma-CoVs can also greatly affect
livestock (11-13). For example, in 2017, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus,
an alpha-CoV, led to the death of more than 24,000 piglets in Guangdong, China (11).

Characteristic features of CoVs include a high genetic diversity (7, 14), frequent

mutation (15), recombination (16, 17), and most importantly, frequent cross-host
transmissions (11, 18-20) which is facilitated by the spike protein (21-23). These
features pose serious challenges for the eradication and mitigation campaigns in case
of epidemics, and make even the taxonomic classification of these viruses a challenging
task. The traditional classification of CoVs (2-5) relies on phenotypic information such
as the host range, and takes into account of the phylogeny of the viruses. Most of these
phylogenetic analyses performed on CoVs rely on one of these two approaches (3) : (i)
analyses based on the whole genome sequences; (ii) analyses based on individual
conserved proteins, most prominently ORF1a/1b, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and
membrane proteins. These analyses are useful for closely related species/lineages, but
become problematic for more distant relationships (24). For example, the node
robustness of phylogenetic trees built on the basis of whole genomes of distantly related
species is often unreliable as can be judged by their bootstrap values (25). As a result,
no comprehensive classification of coronaviruses is currently available.

In this study, we adopted a different approach based on the identification and use of a
set of five concatenated CoVs protein clusters to create an Orthocoronavirinae species
tree, by using the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL, https://www.micans.org/mcl/) (26).
This phylogenetic species tree is robust, and is consistent with the current ICTV
classification, and thus should be useful for the classification of future new CoV isolates.
Furthermore, through reconciliation with the corresponding gene trees (27-29), this
species tree allowed us to infer the apparent “horizontal gene transfer” (HGT) events

for each of the five protein clusters, which we surmised can serve as a marker for crosshost transmissions. The specific cases of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2
are discussed.

Results and Discussion
We searched through 3,880 genomes of coronaviruses from three databases NCBI,
NGDC,

and

GISAID

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/;

https://bigd.big.ac.cn/;

https://www.gisaid.org), and compiled 396 complete genomes with sequence identity
lower than 95% (Supplementary Table S1). The predicted protein sequences were fed
to the subsequent MCL analysis using graph clustering (26). In total, 116 protein
clusters were identified, among which five clusters, i.e., ORF1b, ORF1a, spike,
membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins were found to be the most prevalent (Table 1,
Supplementary Fig. S1). These clusters were then chosen for alignment to construct a
bootstrapped phylogenetic tree using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood
(RAxML) (30) (Fig. 1). In this step, we added other 26 genome sequences isolated from

different hosts, albeit with identity greater than 95% to the 396 sequences mentioned
above (Supplementary Table S2). The bovine torovirus (NC_007447) from
Tobaniviridae (31, 32) was selected as the outgroup. The virus genera (according to
ICTV classification), the host families and host receptors (if available), and the size of
genomes are also included in Fig. 1, in order to provide a comprehensive view of these
metadata (3, 4).

As can be seen in Fig. 1, this analysis yields genera and species that are largely
congruous with the current ICTV classification (5), but the interpretation of the results
is far more straightforward and requires just genome sequences. The resulting
phylogenetic tree has a high degree of robustness, compared to those obtained using
whole genome sequences, or the ORF1a/1b proteins or domains (see Methods). For
example, nodes of branches of the most ancestral lineages of the tree were supported
by bootstrap values ≥80%. Moreover, this phylogenetic tree can clearly distinguish
different species of the viruses for the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, while the
phylogeny based on the ORF1a/b domains alone, which is better suited for
classification at the order level (33), cannot do it.

Notably, this circular map format clearly shows the viruses along the same or closely
related evolutionary branches can infect different hosts. For instance, in the specific
case of SARS-CoV, 29 viruses clustered into a monophyletic clade, which included 22
strains isolated from Chiroptera (bats), four from Viverridae (palm civets), and three
from Hominidae (humans). Similarly, several MERS-CoVs that form a monophyletic
clade in the inferred tree were isolated from Chiroptera, Camelidae (dromedary camels),
and Hominidae. In the section containing the coronaviruses Human_CoV_OC43 which
are responsible for a common human flu, several hosts appear in the map (34, 35),
reflecting the considerable promiscuity of their hosts including Bovidae (cattle),
Leporidae (rabbits), Camelidae, Suidae (swine), and Equidae (horses).

We next determined the apparent HGT events among the viruses, which we assumed
would indicate their cross-host transmissions. To this end, the reconciliations between
the concatenated phylogeny and the related gene trees for the five protein clusters was
performed, using RANGER-DTL version 2.0 (36). A visualized summary is given in
Fig. 2 (30). We identified three types of transfer: (i) clade to clade, (ii) clade to strain,
(iii) strain to strain. Within the same host, HGT occurred most frequently for
Phasianidae, followed by Felidae and Hominidae (Fig. 2B). Transfer events across
different hosts for clusters 3, 4, 5 (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins,
respectively) were more frequent than for the other two clusters. Among different hosts,
bats were the most frequent donor or receiver, followed by Suidae, Camelidae,
Hominidae, and Phasianidae (Fig. 2C). This immediately suggests an urgent need for
erecting ecological barriers between livestock and wild animals, and between humans
and wild animals, as well as for worldwide monitoring of coronaviruses.

We then examined in more details the inferred HGT events for SARS-CoV, MERSCoV and SARS-CoV-2. For this analysis, an expanded dataset of 269 complete
genomes of the beta-CoVs with sequence identity lower than 99.8% was used, except
that only four SARS-CoV-2 genomes of human origin were included (37), to reduce
the redundancy (Supplementary Table S3). The Human_CoV_229E (NC_002645)
from alpha-CoVs (3) was selected as the outgroup. For SARS-CoV (Fig. 3A), there
were apparent transfer links among Chiroptera, Viverridae and Hominidae. This result
is consistent with the current knowledge concerning the evolution of SARS-CoVs, with

the palm civet as the likely intermediate host (16, 38, 39). As there is no evidence for
direct transmission of this virus between Chiroptera and Hominidae, the gene transfer
between Hominidae and Chiroptera as depicted in Fig. 3A might be an indirect result
of separated transfer events between Chiroptera and Viverridae, and between
Viverridae and Hominidae. The pattern found for MERS-CoV (Fig. 3B) is again
consistent with accumulated evidence indicating the dromedary camel as a probable
vector for human infections (8, 40, 41). For SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3C), transfer links were
found between Chiroptera and Hominidae, and between Chiroptera and Manidae
(pangolins). Interestingly, no gene transfer between Hominidae and Manidae can be
inferred from our analysis. Pangolins were suggested to be involved in the species jump
of SARS-CoV-2 to humans (37, 42). However, more recent studies have disputed this
notion (37, 43, 44). Finally, while the links among Hominidae, Mustelidae (minks), and
Felidae (tigers) were deduced, it remains to be seen how SARS-CoV-2 viruses were
transmitted among them. Taken together, we argue that these inferred apparent HGT
events can serve as a possible marker for cross-host transmissions of coronaviruses.

In summary, based on the analysis of concatenated protein clusters of the viral genome
sequences, we present a framework to produce robust phylogeny and classification for
CoVs, and to infer the apparent HGT events and cross host transmissions for the
Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. This should help to understand how CoVs are
transmitted to humans, and aid in devising strategies to combat the severe global health
threat posed by these viruses.

Methods
Genome sequence collection and marker selection
Genome datasets were compiled with CD-HIT version 4.7 (45). Open reading frames
(ORFs) in the datasets were predicted by using GeneMarkS version 4.32 (46), and then
annotated

using

BLAST

against

the

NR

database

(https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/) with e-value ≤ 10-5.
Marker selections were performed with the Markov Cluster algorithm of OrthoMCL,
with the parameter of ‘-I 1.5’ (26). The 20 protein clusters with abundancy in a genus
higher than 30% are listed in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Phylogenetic inference and apparent HGT inference
For the phylogenetic analyses, the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the datasets
(the 422 genome sequences used for the analysis of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae,
and the 269 genome sequences used for the analysis of beta-CoVs ) were analyzed by
MAFFT v7.407 (47) based on the five concatenated protein clusters or each individual
cluster. Subsequently, maximum likelihood phylogenies were estimated using RAxML
version 7.2.8 (48), utilizing the PROTGAMMALG model with 100 bootstrap replicates.
The apparent HGT events were inferred based on reconciliation of the species tree and
the corresponding gene tree (27), by using RANGER-DTL version 2.0 with default
parameters (https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/RANGER-DTL/) (36, 49). The
apparent HGT events were then presented by using Gephi 0.9.2.
For comparison of robustness, two other phylogenetic trees were also built, based on

the full genome, and the five concatenated domains of ORF1a/b that are used in the
ICTV classification approach by the Coronaviridae Study Group (e.g., 3CLpro, NiRAN,
RdRp, ZBD, and HEL1) (3, 33). The phylogenetic tree based on the full genome was
constructed using RAxML with the GTRGAMMA model and 1,000 bootstrap
replicates. The phylogenetic tree based on the five concatenated domains of ORF1a/1b
was built using the same method as that based on the five concatenated protein clusters
described above.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Rooted phylogeny of 422 Orthocoronavirinae viruses with the bovine
torovirus from Tobaniviridae as the outgroup, inferred from five concatenated protein
clusters using RAxML v7.2.8. Bootstrap support values ≥ 80% are shown as dots on
interior nodes. Ring colors indicate the virus genus classification (indicated as squares
in the legend) and their host phylogeny (indicated as triangles in the legend). Virus
genome sizes are shown in the peripheral circle. Coronavirus information is provided
in Supplementary Tables S1/S2. The visualization of the phylogenetic tree was
performed by using iToL (https://itol.embl.de/) (50).

Figure 2. Statistics of the inferred horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events and host
jumps of coronaviruses. A. Counts of transfer events that are within the same host
family and among different host families. The colors within a bar stand for three
different type of transfer events (i.e., from clade to clade, from clade to strain, from
strain to strain. B. Counts of transfer events within the same host family. Each circle
indicates a host family as shown in the label and its size is proportional to the number
of transfer events within the same host family. C. Inferred host jump network of
coronaviruses based on the transfer events. Each line indicates the predicted host jump
between two host families and its thickness is proportional to the number of host jump
events. Each circle indicates host family as shown in the label and its size is
proportional to the number of host jump between different host families. (Figs. 2B and
2C is generated using Gephi 0.9.2, https://gephi.org) (30).

Figure 3. Cross-host transmissions inferred from horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
events for SARS-CoV (A), MERS-CoV (B), and SARS-CoV-2 (C). The circles
correspond to the hosts, and the lines correspond to the apparent HGT events among
the hosts.
