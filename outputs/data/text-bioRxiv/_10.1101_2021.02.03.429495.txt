Summary
SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly since 2019 and has produced large-scale
mutations in the genomes. Differences in gene sequences may lead to changes in
protein structure and traits, which would have a great impact on the epidemiological
characteristics. In this study, we selected the key mutations of SARS-CoV-2,
including D614G and A222V of S protein and Q57H of ORF3a protein, to conduct
molecular dynamics simulation and analysis on the structures of the mutant proteins.
The results suggested that D614G improved the stability of S protein, while A222V
enhanced the ability of protein to react with the outside environment. Q57H enhanced
the structural flexibility of ORF3a protein. Our findings could complete the
mechanistic link between genotype--phenotype--epidemiological characteristics in the
study of SARS-CoV-2. We also found no significant changes in the antigenicity of S
protein, ORF3a protein and their mutants, which provides reference for vaccine
development and application.

Introduction
In the winter of 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, came into view, and the
resulting COVID-19 quickly swept the world. By 0:00 on January 11, 2021
(GMT+8:00), the total number of diagnosed patients has exceeded 90.27 million.
Covid-19 has been a major blow to public health, social order and economic
development around the world.
As the virus spreads, it accumulates a large number of genomic mutations that alter
the structure of proteins, which would increase the complexity of the virus
subpopulation and pose a threat to prevention and control measures such as virus
detection, drug development and the practical application of vaccines. In the case of
MERS-CoV, the I529T, D510G mutations in RBD lead to decreased affinity with the
human CD26 receptor (Kim et al., 2016), but increased resistance to
antibody-mediated neutralization. In the case of SARS-CoV (Meulen et al., 2006), the
P462L mutation of S protein can achieve the escape of human mAb Cr3014
(Kleine-Weber et al., 2019).
The genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
composed of ~30,000 nucleotides and contains 12 open reading frames (ORFs).
SARS-CoV-2 encodes 4 structural including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane
(M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and 22 nonstructural proteins (nsp) which are
nsp1â€“16 encoded by ORF1ab and 6 accessory proteins, i.e. ORF3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and
9b (Chan et al., 2020). Many mutations have also been present in SARS-CoV-2.
Recently, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Nigeria and other places have reported
the emergence and prevalence of mutant strains (Tegally et al., 2020; Leung et al.,
2021; Mastriani et al., 2021; Shaibu et al., 2021). More disturbingly, a SARS-CoV-2

variant that achieved in vitro escapement from highly neutralizing COVID-19
convalescent plasma has been reported (Andreano et al., 2020). Therefore, real-time
monitoring of the epidemic trends of key mutations and haplotypes in evolution, and
exploring the influence of mutations on virus phenotypes and the relationship between
mutations and epidemiological characteristics are of great significance for the
development of targeted prevention and control measures. The key mutations of this
study were screened out from the previous research, revealed the D614G and A222V
in S (Spike) protein and Q57H in ORF3a as the key mutations(Bai et al., 2020; Xi et
al., 2020).
The D614G mutation began spreading in Europe in early February, which has been
reported to significantly increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in continuous cell
lines(Hou et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Plante et al., 2020; Xi et al., 2020;
Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The A222V variant, first reported from
Spain in March, is rapidly spread since July across Europe and accounted for about
16.3% of all GISAID submitted genomes and the Q57H variant appeared around
February 7, 2020 and accounted for about 16.7% of all GISAID submitted genomes
(accessed Nov 29, 2020) (Xi et al., 2020). These imply A222V variant and Q57H
variant may also play an important role in increasing infectivity.
The transmembrane protein, the S protein, mediates coronavirus entry into host cells.
Because of its important role in virus transmission (Tortorici and Veesler, 2019), the
study of S protein has always been the focus of coronavirus-related research. The
protein forms a homotrimer on the surface of the virus, containing the S1 subunit that
binds to the host cell receptor and the S subunit that is involved in the fusion of the
viral membrane to the cell membrane. A series of studies have shown that two
subunits of the S protein of coronavirus bind non-covalently in a prefusion
conformation, while host proteases lyse the S protein during viral entry into the cell.
This modification has been proposed to activate the protein for membrane fusion by
irreversible conformational changes (Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Kirchdoerfer et al.,
2016; Walls et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2020).

Because the S protein is exposed to the surface and plays an important role in
transmission, it is considered to be the primary target of post-infection neutralizing
antibodies and is the focus of treatment and vaccine design. Due to its important role
in viral mechanism and prevention measures, the mutation of S protein is likely to
have an impact on the phenotype and epidemiological characteristics of the virus, and
even the function of antibodies.
ORF3a, one of the ion channels of SARS-CoV-2, is a dimer with three transmembrane
helices in each, located in the lipid nanodisk (Kern et al., 2020). Its coding region has
been reported to be highly conserved in bat coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and
related bat coronaviruses. In mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 infection, ORF3a
genomic deletions reduced viral titers and morbidity, making ORF3a a potential target
for the treatment of SARS (Issa et al., 2020). Therefore, the structural change of
ORF3A caused by the mutation is likely to influence the phenotype and thus affect the
epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, we have performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to evaluate the
effect of D614G single-site mutation and D614G&A222V double-site mutation on the
structural dynamics of S protein, as well as the effect of Q57H mutation on the
structural dynamics of ORF3a. The results showed that D614G improved the stability
of S protein, while A222V improved the ability of protein to react with the outside
environment. Q57H enhanced the flexibility of ORF3a protein, which affected the
pore size and internal resistance of the channel. In addition, we also analyzed the
antigenicity of D614G, D614G&A222V and Q57H variants, it was found that the
change of structure had no significant effect on the antigenicity of the protein
molecules. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the in-depth studies
of the relationship of "genotype-phenotypic-epidemiological characteristics" of
SARS-CoV-2, which would help to better understand the virus and address the
complexities of COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Results
D614G improved the stability of S protein, while A222V improved the ability of
protein to react with the outside environment
Based on the reported cryo-electron microscopy structure of S protein (PDB ID:
6X6P), we constructed D614G and D614G&A222V of which sequences differ from
the wide-type (WT) S protein by changing the aspartic acid to glycine at the 614th
amino acid site, and changing both the aspartic acid to glycine at the 614th amino acid
site as well as the alanine to valine at the 222th amino acid site (Figure 1A). We
exploited 100-ns MD simulations of the D614G, D614G&A222V and wide-type S
proteins. To verify the convergence of MD simulation equilibrium, we analyzed the
root mean square deviations (RMSD) throughout the MD process (Figure 2A), after
excluding the initial effect of model relaxation due to the introduction of the force
field in the first half of simulation(Pereira et al., 2019). The RMSD of wild-type as
well as D614G and D614G&A222V mutants appeared to be stable in the latter 50ns,
revealing a good convergence was achieved for each system. The latter 50ns could be
considered as the stable period. Interestingly, the RMSD of these two mutants were
found to be slightly smaller than that of the wide-type S protein especially in the latter
25 ns (Figure 2A). For the two mutants, their RMSD fluctuated within a small range
and did not show an obvious difference in the latter 25 ns.
To further investigate the structural fluctuations and flexibilities of the wide-type,
D614G and D614G&A222V, we further evaluated the detailed residual atomic
fluctuations by computing the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of protein CÎ±
atoms (Figure 3A). It should be noted that the RMSF of highly dynamic terminal
residues are not shown. For S protein, RMSF analysis showed that the overall trend of
flexibility of WT, D614G, D614G&A222V did not change too much, and the
mutation at position 222 led to a steep increase in local structure flexibility, which
was noteworthy.
The structural compactness of the wide-type, D614G and D614G&A222V mutants of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429495; this version posted March 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

S protein was studied by evaluating the radius gyration (Rg) which provides
information for the overall size of the structure. It was found that the wide type has
the largest Rg value followed by D614G&222V, and D614G has the smallest Rg value
(Figure 4A), suggesting that the structure of D614G is more compact than
D614G&A222V and the wide type. These structures suggest that the D614G&222V
of S protein is more compact than WT and more stretchable relative to D614G.T
Analysis of SASA as a surface accessible to proteins provides information about the
ability of proteins to interact with other molecules. The whole molecular SASA of
wide-type, D614G and D614G&A222V mutants of S protein was analyzed(Figure
5A). The results showed that under stable state, the SASA of wide type was
significantly higher than that of mutant D614G, and was similar to but slightly higher
than that of D614G&A222V, and the two fluctuated within a small range.
We also performed the hydrogen bond analysis, which showed that the average
number of hydrogen bonds in the wild-type was lower than that of D615G and D614G
was lower than that of D614G&A222V(Figure 6A) for S protein. These results
indicate that the S protein mutants, especially the mutants D614G&A222V interact
more with the solvent, the stability is higher than that of the wild-type of S protein.
Q57H enhanced the flexibility of ORF3a protein
In the latter 50ns, RMSD of Q57h was significantly higher than WT, but the values of
both were stable in a small range(Figure 2B). Q57H and WT of ORF3a can be
considered to be stable in the analysis stage.
The RMSF analysis revealed that the mutant Q57H was more flexible than WT on the
overall trend of ORF3a, while the mutant Q57H was less flexible at the position
57(Figure 3B). Although there is a local decline in RMSF at the mutant residue, this
indicates that the conversion of amino acid from glutamine(Q) to histidine(H) at
position 57 reduces the flexibility of the protein nearby that residue. However, the
significant increase in total RMSF suggests that local amino acid changes affect the

whole protein conformation and its properties.
The analysis of Rg showed that the Q57H mutant was slightly larger than WT(Figure
4B). Which suggest the WT of ORF3a is slightly more compact than that of Q57H
mutants. The difference of protein volume and tightness reflects the degree of contact
between the protein and the external environment to a certain extent, and the
difference between WT and Q57H of ORF3a also implies the difference of their
response ability to the external environment to a certain extent.
For ORF3a protein, the SASA of WT and Q57H are similar in stable state, fluctuating
in a small range and Q57H is slightly higher than WT(Figure 5B), suggests that the
wild-type ORF3a protein is less accessible. The difference of SASA could affect the
ability of the wild-type or mutant of these proteins to interact with other molecules.
The average number of wild-type hydrogen bonds was higher than that of
Q57H(Figure 6B). These results indicate that the wild-type protein of ORF3a interact
more with the solvent, and their stability is higher than thatQ57H mutants.
No significant change in the antigenicity of S protein, ORF3a protein and their
mutants was found
The development of vaccine is one of the most important means of long-term
prevention and control of the virus. Antigenicity is an indicator of the ability of a
peptide to bind to its complementary antibodies (van Regenmortel, 2001). The
antigenicity was analyzed by Ellipro (Ponomarenko et al., 2008), a structure-based
web-tool that implements Thornton's method and, together with a residue clustering
algorithm, the MODELLER program and the Jmol viewer. The antigenicity of S
protein and ORF3a protein was analyzed respectively (Figure 7). The results showed
that the antigenicity of S protein and ORF3a protein fluctuated highly in different
local regions, but there was no significant change in the overall trend. This indicated
that these mutations did not change the ability of S protein and ORF3a protein of
SARS-CoV-2 to react with the antibodies.

Discussion
S protein is located on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, and it has been indicated that the
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a characteristic Furin cleavage site at the boundary
between S1/S2 subunits.(Madu et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Walls et al.,
2020) S protein mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells through ACE2. The
amino acid variation in the SARS-CoV-2 region will lead to the change of virus
infection characteristics, which is related to the effective transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 in human population.
ORF3a protein is a large conductance cation channel of SARS-CoV-2, which is
moderately selective for K+ and Na+ and can exist in the form of trimer, tetramer and
potential high-order oligomer.(Kern et al., 2020) ORF3a has been shown to be
associated with virulence, infectivity, ion channel formation and viral release.(Issa et
al., 2020) The function of ORF3a is conserved in common mutations, but the pore of
the channel is altered by variation(Kern et al., 2020).
Mutation is one of the main mechanisms by which viruses are constantly changing
due to genetic selection. Although most point mutations are neutral and do not alter
the protein the gene codes for, a few favorable mutations can give an evolutionary
advantage to viruses (Wu et al., 2020). The D614G substitution in the gene encoding
the spike protein emerged in late January or early February 2020, and emerged in
Europe around 2020 February 22 (Korber et al., 2020). Since then, the D614G variant
quickly became popular in Europe and by June 2020 became the dominant form of the
virus circulating globally (Korber et al., 2020; Xi et al., 2020; World Health
Organization, 2021). The D614G mutation has been reported to change the S protein
conformation and enhance the efficiency of protease cleavage at the S1/S2 subunit
junctions, which may be one of the reasons for promoting its infection to the host and
improving the transmission efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 (Gobeil et al., 2021). Studies
on the D614G mutant of S protein at the atomic simulation level indicate that D614G

has stronger adaptability and higher transmissible carbon skeleton (Omotuyi et al.,
2020). A222V has recently been reported as a rapidly increasing genotype (Bartolini
et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2021). Q57H of ORF3a has been reported that it shows an
opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million (Oulas et
al., 2021), It also causes significant structural changes that affect the interaction
between ORF3a and other proteins (Wu et al., 2020). From the level of molecular
simulation, our study explored the change of protein traits when D614G and A222V
were coupled for S protein, and the influence of Q57H on protein traits for ORF3a
protein. In general, we have conducted in-depth studies on the changes of the
characteristics of these two proteins and their mutants at the molecular level, which
provides reference information for explaining the phenomena found in other studies.
The effect of amino acid mutations on proteins can be thoroughly analyzed using
molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation is an important tool
in the study of biomolecules, which has been widely used in the study of protein
stability, conformational change and other fields. The purpose of molecular dynamics
simulation is to reproduce the real behavior of proteins in their links and calculate
their trajectories over time. During this process, the detailed information of protein
conformational changes and fluctuations can be used to evaluate structural parameters
such as stability and flexibility.(Krebs and Mesquita, 2016) Changes in protein
structural parameters may result in pathological phenotypes(Kumar et al., 2014; Khan
et al., 2016). In this study, the S protein, ORF3a protein and their variants of
SARS-CoV-2 were simulated by molecular dynamics, aiming to study the effects of
the D614G and A222V mutations of S protein and the Q57H mutation of ORF3a
protein on the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between
them and the epidemiological characteristics.
During the analysis phase in this study, RMSD values were observed to be in a
stationary state, indicating that the structure fluctuated around a stable mean
conformation. Therefore, it is meaningful to evaluate the fluctuation of local
structure.(MartÃ­nez, 2015; Pereira et al., 2019)

During the stable period (the latter 50ns) of the simulation process, the two proteins
and their mutants showed different properties. For S protein, the RMSD (based on the
analysis of CÎ±) of D614G(0.4894485) and D614G&A222V (0.5085670) has a certain
decline compared with wild type (0.5376845), this suggests that the mutation of the
residue located on No. 614 to glycine(G) from aspartic acid (D) promoted S protein
stability (Arooj et al., 2020), the stability of the ascension is proportional to the
effectiveness (Zhang et al., 2020). This is also consistent with current epidemiological
data. This phenomenon was also verified in hydrogen bond analysis, since the
stability of protein structure is determined by the number of interactions (Pikkemaat et
al., 2002), and the average number of hydrogen bonds between the mutant D614G
(2348.866627) and D614G&A222V (2354.032793) in the stable state was higher than
that of the wild type (2311.066187). The difference between the two mutants showed
another phenomenon, although the number of hydrogen bonds in the D614G&A222V
mutants was higher than that in the D614G mutants, the RMSD was lower. This
suggests that the increase in hydrogen bonding not only promotes the stability of the
protein, but also affects other properties. The analysis of SASA (habitual accessible
surface areas) provides evidence to explain this phenomenon. Compared with D614G
(1237.652733), D614G&A222V (1264.366661) has a higher value of SASA, which
indicates that D614G&A222V has a higher protein interaction ability (Joshi et al.,
2017) while retaining the stability brought by the mutation at 614, and is more likely
to react with the outside environment. This further enhanced the efficiency of
transmission, which is consistent with epidemiological data.
In the case of ORF3a, an increase in the RMSD of the mutant Q57H relative to the
wild-type and a decrease in the mean hydrogen bond number suggest a partial loss of
stability. However, from the increase of Rg, we can know that the Q57H mutant of
ORF3a results in largen in volume, and the increase of SASA indicates the increase of
ORF3a protein's reaction ability to the external environment (Joshi et al., 2017). For
the flexibility, although the mutation of amino acid No. 57 reduced the local
flexibility near the residue, the overall RMSF increased compared with the wild type,

indicating that the flexibility of the whole ORF3a protein increased, so its channel
pore size expanded and its internal space resistance decreased (Zhang et al., 2019). In
general, the performance of ORF3a as a channel protein has been improved, which
may be a beneficial mutation for SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the
epidemiological data.
Our study provides a mechanistic hypothesis for the change in transmissibility caused
by mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genotype. Although these mutations and their
consequences are disturbing, fortunately, our analysis of the antigenicity of S proteins
and ORF3a suggests that these mutations do not significantly alter their ability to
react with antibodies. The prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 is a long process.
With the emergence of more and more mutants, the mechanism of "genotype -phenotype -- epidemiological characteristics" caused by mutations will become one of
the key directions of future research. Our study provides some reference for the
continuous exploration of this problem, and also provides information from the
perspective of molecular dynamics for the deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2.

Limitations of the Study
In this study, we used MD simulation to explore the molecular mechanism by which
key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 affect transmission. Due to the fluctuation of
molecular simulation calculation, the calculation result is bound to have some
residuals. MD provides a unique perspective at the molecular level for relevant
studies, and the epidemiological trend is consistent with the results of MD. However,
the simulation results can only be more accurate after the verification of relevant
experiments. Computers cannot fully simulate the movement of real proteins, which is
the limitation of this project.

Methods
The cryo-electron microscopic structures of the wide type S protein (PDB ID: 6X6P)
and ORF3a (PDB ID: 7KJR) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Berman et
al., 2002). The key mutation information of S protein and ORF3a protein was
previously studied by Xi et al 2020. The sequence information comes from the A
chain of the two proteins. The point mutation of protein was conducted by MOE2019.
Using the structures obtained from PDB as initial templates, we induced mutations in
Molecular Operating Environment 2019 to obtain S protein mutants D614G,
D614G&A222V and ORF3a protein mutant Q57H. For each system, the MD
simulations were performed using Gromacs 2018.3, and the Gromacs 54A7 force
field was selected (Huang et al., 2011). All structures were solvated with SPCE

and Na+ and Cl- ions were added to neutralize the system. We first performed a

processes in the MD simulation: NVT, NPT, and production. The NVT ensemble

electrostatic through the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method . A time step of 0.002 ps
was selected in the simulation without constant force being applied.
The antigenicity information is analyzed using the Ellipro (Ponomarenko et al., 2008)
server with the default parameters.
The biological macromolecules presented in this paper were drawn with PyMol
V2.3.2, and the statistical charts were drawn with Origin 2018.
