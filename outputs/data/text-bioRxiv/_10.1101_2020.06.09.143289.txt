Here we report the testing and application of a simple, structure-aware framework to design target-specific screening libraries for drug
development. Our approach combines advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) with conventional molecular docking to rapidly
explore chemical space conditioned on the unique physiochemical properties of the active site of a biomolecular target. As a proof-ofconcept, we used our framework to construct a focused library for cyclin-dependent kinase type-2 (CDK2). We then used it to rapidly generate
a library specific to the active site of the main protease (Mpro ) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. By comparing approved and
experimental drugs to compounds in our library, we also identified six drugs, namely, Naratriptan, Etryptamine, Panobinostat, Procainamide,
Sertraline, and Lidamidine, as possible SARS-CoV-2 Mpro targeting compounds and, as such, potential drug repurposing candidates. To
complement the open-science COVID-19 drug discovery initiatives, we make our SARS-CoV-2 Mpro library fully accessible to the research
community (https://github.com/atfrank/SARS-CoV-2).
Virtual Screening Libraries | Biophysical Modeling | Computational Drug Discovery

Developing new drugs is costly and timeconsuming; by some estimates, bringing a new drug
to market requires ≥13 years at the cost of ≥US$1
billion.(1) As such, there is a keen interest in accelerating the drug development pipeline and reduce
its cost. In principle, computer-aided drug development can both accelerate and lower the cost of
identifying viable drug candidates.(2) For instance,
during hit identification, where the goal is to identify
small molecules that may bind to the target, one
could restrict testing to only the compounds that
are predicted to bind to the target with high affinity.
However, the computational cost of screening large
chemical libraries can still be burdensome. The computation cost of virtual screening could be reduced
by working with smaller and more focused, targetspecific virtual libraries, enriched in compounds that
are likely to bind to a specific site on the target of
interest.(3) Such libraries can be constructed by carrying out de novo design, during which compounds
are designed on-the-fly, guided by the unique physiochemical properties of the active site of the target.(4–
17) However, because of the difficulty in formalizing
diverse reaction rules and implementing robust algorithms to intelligently apply them, up to this point,
such de novo design frameworks often produce synthetically inaccessible compounds.

Fortunately, advances in generative artificial intelligence now make it possible to design both chemically novel and synthetically feasible compounds in
silico.(18–23) Noteworthy among these frameworks
are those based on autoencoders. Autoencoders
are unsupervised machine learning models that, by
virtue of their architecture, are able to learn a compact, latent space representation of chemical space
when they are trained with molecular data. The task
of designing target-specific libraries can, therefore,
be cast as one of exploring the latent space of such
models, conditioned on the unique properties of the
active site on the target of interest. Currently lacking, however, are efficient, structure-aware strategies
for sampling the latent space of generative molecular models. If developed, such techniques could
find utility in constructing active-site and targetspecific virtual libraries that are likely to contain hit
compounds that, if synthesized, might bind to the
targeted site. More immediately, they could be used
to construct a ligand-based pharmacophore model
that can be used to screen millions of compounds in
a matter of seconds.(24)
Here, we tested and implemented a novel,
structure-based framework for constructing targetspecific libraries by sampling the latent space of generative machine learning models conditioned on the

unique physiochemical properties of the “active site”
of a target. We reasoned that we could implement
such a pipeline by combining generative molecular
machine learning models with molecular computer
docking algorithms. For instance, one could start by
embedding a reference compound, e.g., benzene, into
the latent space of a generative autoencoder model
and sample latent space points in its “neighborhood.”
The sampled points can then be decoded into their
corresponding 3-dimensional (3D) representations
and then docked onto the target (Figure 1a). Of
these sampled compounds, the one that is predicted
to interact most favorably with the active site can be
identified and then used as the new reference. The
process can be repeated (Figure 1b), and in so doing, the latent-space of a generative molecular model
(and, so chemical space) explored in a semi-directed
manner, conditioned on the properties of the active
site of the target. The compounds sampled during
this iterative (“sample-and-dock”) process could then
be used to construct a target-specific virtual library.
First, we implemented a sample-and-dock pipeline
and then used it to construct a target-specific library
for the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) protein.

We chose CDK2 because it is an important therapeutic target that has been extensively studied biochemically and structurally, and for which a large
library of known inhibitors is readily accessible.(25)
To achieve this, we first interfaced the junction-tree
variational autoencoder (JTVAE)(26) with the docking program, rDock.(27) JTVAE was chosen because
it has demonstrated a superior ability to generate synthetically feasible molecules, and rDock was chosen
because it is fast, and the software is open-sourced.
We then applied our JTVAE-rDock sample-and-dock
pipeline (Figure 1a and b) to CDK2. For this CDK2
test case, we initiated sample-the-dock pipeline by
first mapping the CDK2 active site using the crystal structure of CDK2 complexed with Roniciclib
(PDB: 5IEV).(28) The JTVAE-rDock sample-anddock pipeline was then initialized using benzene as
a starting scaffold. We chose to use benzene as the
starting scaffold because it is small and a chemical motif that is ubiquitous in known drugs. Each
sample-and-dock cycle consisted of sampling and
docking 20, unique compounds. For each compound,
100 poses were generated during docking. The compound with the highest predicted binding affinity

Materials and Methods
Sample-and-Dock. To construct structure-aware and

target-specific virtual libraries, we implemented a conditional generative sampling scheme. Our conditional
generative sampling scheme, which we refer to as sampleand-dock, combines a pre-trained generative variational
autoencoder (VAE) model with molecular docking (see
below). In sample-and-dock, the exploration of the latent space of a pre-trained generative model is made
conditional on the unique physiochemical and biophysical
properties of the binding site on a target, T , by using
a greedy algorithm that optimizes a cost function that
dependent of the properties of the target. Here we use
molecular docking scoring function as the cost function in
our greedy algorithm. Accordingly, given a set of latentspace samples, the “best” is selected as the one that, when
decoded into its molecular representation, yields the highest binding affinities (Ai ), as estimated using a molecular
docking scoring function.
Briefly, to construct a customized target-specific library
using this conditional sampling scheme, we first embed
a reference compound in the latent space of a generative
model (mi æ zi ) and then sample a set of {zi+1 } in the
“neighborhood” of the reference zi . The {zi+1 } can then
be decoded (zi+1 æ mi+1,D ) and the resulting molecules
docked into the active site of T . Using a greedy optimization strategy, the “best” of these designed molecules can
be identified using by the docking-derived Ai+1 and then
it is used as the new reference for the next round of sample and dock. The process is then repeated over many
cycles to explore the chemical space in a semi-directed
manner and conditioned on the properties of T .
Implementation. Using a set of in-house python scripts,
we implemented a sample-and-dock pipeline that interfaced with the junction-tree-variation autoencoder (JTVAE) model of Jin and coworkers,(26) with the molecular
docking program rDock.(27). All instances of sampleand-dock were initialized using benzene. At the start of
Xu et al.

each cycle, the seeding molecule was taken in the form
of SMILES strings and converted into one-hot encoding according to a set of predefined vocabulary. The
one-hot encoding was first transformed into a set of two
28-dimensional vectors by the encoders of JTVAE as locations in the two latent spaces. The latent vectors were
then re-sampled and reconstructed (decoded to SMILES
strings) 20 times by the decoders to generate 20 unique
molecules that resemble the seed. For each generated
molecule, the SMILES string was converted to a 3D structure using RDKit and then docked into the active site on
the target using rDock. Across all the generated molecules
within the cycle, the designed molecule with the highest
Ai , as estimated using the rDock scoring function, was
used to as the seed molecule for the next cycle. The process is repeated over many cycles, and the best compound
from each cycle used to construct the final library.
Target-Specific Libraries. We used our sample-and-dock

pipeline to construct target-specific libraries for CDK2
and SAR-CoV-2 Mpro . For CDK2, sample-and-dock was
carried out using the crystal structure of CDK2 bound
with Roniciclib (PDB ID: 5IEV).(28) For SAR-CoV-2
Mpro , we used the crystal structure Mpro bound to N3
(PDB ID: 6Y2F).(32) From the crystal structures, the ligands and receptors separated and saved as separate coordinate files using PyMOL. To map the active sites of each
target, cavity mapping was carried out using the referenceligand method that is implemented in the rbcavity tool
from rDock. For the reference-ligand method, the radius
of the overlapping sphere was set to 7.0 Å, and the radius
of the small probe radii was set to 1.5 Å. For both CDK2
and Mpro , sample-and-dock was initialized using benzene
and ran for 48 hours.
