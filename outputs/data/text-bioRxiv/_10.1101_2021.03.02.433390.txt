Abstract

52
53

Adjuvanted soluble protein vaccines have been used extensively in humans for protection against various

54

viral infections based on their robust induction of antibody responses. Here, soluble prefusion-stabilized

55

spike trimers (preS dTM) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were

56

formulated with the adjuvant AS03 and administered twice to nonhuman primates (NHP). Binding and

57

functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that NHP developed AS03-dependent

58

multi-functional humoral responses that targeted multiple spike domains and bound to a variety of

59

antibody FC receptors mediating effector functions in vitro. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralizing IC50

60

titers were on average greater than 1000 and significantly higher than a panel of human convalescent sera.

61

NHP were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (3x106 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2

62

(USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days post-challenge, vaccinated NHP showed rapid control of viral

63

replication in both the upper and lower airways. Notably, vaccinated NHP also had increased spike-

64

specific IgG antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days post challenge. Moreover, vaccine-induced

65

IgG mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge following passive transfer to hamsters. These data

66

show that antibodies induced by the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine are sufficient to mediate

67

protection against SARS-CoV-2 and support the evaluation of this vaccine in human clinical trials.

Introduction

69
70

The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory

71

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic with 112,849,164 infections and

72

2,503,390 deaths across 192 countries, as of February 25, 20211. An effective prophylactic vaccine

73

remains the most effective public health measure for controlling disease spread2. To that end, two mRNA

74

vaccines3, 4 have received emergency use authorization from the FDA based on clinical efficacy of greater

75

than 90% in the US. In addition, adenovirus-based vaccines have been approved for use in the EU, United

76

Kingdom5 and Russia6, and an inactivated virus vaccine is approved in China7. Other candidates based on

77

protein are currently in clinical testing8. With the exception of the inactivated virus vaccines9, 10, these

78

approved and clinical-phase candidate vaccines use only the coronavirus spike (S) protein as their

79

immunogen.

80
81

Spike is a surface membrane-bound trimer that, by electron microscopy, gives viral particles a

82

characteristic halo from which its family name “corona” is derived11. It is a type-1 viral membrane fusion

83

protein that exists in a metastable prefusion conformation and undergoes a dramatic structural

84

rearrangement upon engagement of the receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin-

85

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)12, 13, 14, ultimately leading to membrane fusion. It has been shown that

86

antibodies directed against the RBD can neutralize incoming virus by preventing receptor recognition and

87

thus entry15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Because the RBD, as well as other regions such as the N-terminal domain (NTD)

88

may contain neutralizing epitopes20, 21, the full-length spike is a preferred target antigen for vaccine

89

development. Based upon successful structure-based immunogen designs for SARS-CoV and Middle

90

Eastern Respiratory Virus (MERS) vaccines22, 23, mutations have been introduced to block cleavage of S

91

into S1 and S2 subunits and stabilize a region between the central helix and heptad repeat 1, giving rise to

92

homogeneous S protein trimers in the prefusion conformation24. This construct, referred to as S-2P, is the

93

basis for several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates being delivered by adenoviral vectors25, displayed on

94

nanoparticles26, or encoded by mRNA27, 28, 29.

95
96

In contrast to vectored gene delivery vaccine platforms, adjuvanted soluble protein vaccine formulations

97

have been approved for clinical use against several viral infections30, 31, 32 and have a long history of being

98

used across all age groups. Soluble protein subunit vaccines will likely require a potent adjuvant to elicit

99

strong T and B cell responses33. Here we have formulated a soluble S-2P-derived protein with the well-

100

characterized adjuvant, AS03, an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene, polysorbate 80, and α-

101

tocopherol. AS03 potently induces antibodies and has been shown to increase vaccine durability, promote

102

heterologous strain cross-reactivity34, and to have dose-sparing effects35, 36, 37, 38, 39. It was licensed for use

103

in vaccines against pandemic influenza in Europe, with approximately 90 million doses administered 35, 39,

104

40, 41

105

immunogenicity and protection following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in advance of clinical trials. To date

106

several advanced vaccine candidates have been characterized for the magnitude, quality and efficacy of

107

the immune responses they elicit25, 28, 42, 43. Here we performed a thorough characterization humoral and

108

cellular responses in the upper and lower respiratory tracts following vaccination and challenge. These

109

studies establish that vaccine-induced antibody is sufficient for protection and highlight its role in rapid

110

control of lower airway viral replication.

. Therefore, in this study, AS03-adjuvanted soluble S-2P trimers were evaluated for NHP

Results

112
113

Soluble spike trimers are immunogenic when adjuvanted with AS03

114

To create a SARS-CoV-2 protein vaccine, the S-2P stabilizing mutations were used as previously

115

described24; the trimer was then expressed as a soluble protein by replacing the transmembrane domain

116

with a T4 foldon domain, which has been shown to assist in trimerization of type-1 membrane fusion

117

proteins44, 45 (Fig. 1a). The resulting soluble trimeric protein immunogen is thus referred to as prefusion

118

transmembrane-deleted spike, or preS dTM. PreS dTM trimers were then formulated by admixing with

119

the oil-in-water emulsion, AS03. NHP were immunized intramuscularly three weeks apart with or without

120

AS03 to confirm its role for improving antibody responses. AS03 was critical for the induction of high

121

magnitude S-2P IgG binding and neutralization titers (Fig. S1a-b), and S-2P-specific IgA and IgG B cell

122

responses (Fig. S1c-f). Systems serology was also performed to assess the quantitative and qualitative

123

effector functions of vaccine responses induced by AS03. Antibodies bound to a broad array of human

124

antibody FC receptors and enabled FC-mediated effector functions such as phagocytosis and complement

125

activation (Fig. S1g,h). AS03 strongly enhanced all FC functions equally with no skewing to a particular

126

receptor or function. Collectively these data establish the critical role of the AS03 adjuvant for improving

127

the magnitude and quality of antibody responses.

128
129

To study protective efficacy and perform a wider assessment of immunogenicity, rhesus macaques were

130

immunized with 4 or 12 µg AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM; PBS was administered as a negative control

131

(Fig. 1b). Animals did not experience any abnormal body weight or temperature changes in response to

132

vaccination (Supplementary Table 1). Serum binding titers were detectible two weeks after the first

133

immunization at levels that approximated those found in human convalescent donor sera (HCS) from two

134

different benchmark cohorts; endpoint binding titers were significantly increased from 2.9x103 to 7.4x104

135

following the second immunization in the high dose group (Fig. 2a). Notably there was no significant

136

dose response between the 4 and 12 µg dose groups. In terms of the breadth of binding, antibody

137

responses were observed to the S1 region and more specifically to the RBD and NTD (Fig. 2b).

138
139

Soluble spike trimers adjuvanted with AS03 induce neutralizing antibody responses

140

The next series of studies focused on functional antibody responses following AS03-adjuvanted preS

141

dTM vaccination. First, the second immunization significantly improved serum avidity to S-2P in both

142

dose groups (Fig 2c). Sera from both vaccine dose groups also showed ~100-fold higher competition with

143

ACE2 for binding to the RBD, compared to HCS (Fig. 2d). Inhibition of viral entry was next assessed

144

using a pseudotyped reporter virus. While neutralization was low or undetectable in most animals after

145

the first immunization, reciprocal titers over 103 were achieved in nearly all animals following the boost

146

(Fig. 2E). Similar results were seen with neutralization of live virus in a focus reduction neutralization

147

titer assay, and these responses were generally 10-fold higher than those of HCS (Fig. 2F). Based on

148

recent outbreaks of variant strains, we assessed neutralization against the B.1.1.7 “UK” and B.1.351

149

“South African” variants. Notably, there was ~2-fold decrease against the B.1.1.7 variant, and ~5 to 10 -

150

fold reduction against the B.1.351 variant (Fig. S2).

151
152

Soluble spike trimers adjuvanted with AS03 induce a mixed CD4 T cell response

153

Since adjuvants also have an important effect on the magnitude and quality of CD4 T cells, we measured

154

the frequency of spike specific memory TH1 (IL-2, TNF, and IFNg), TH2 (IL-4, IL-13), Th17 (IL-17) and

155

TFH (CXCR5+, PD-1+, ICOS+) IL-21 and CD40 ligand responses from PBMCs by multi-parameter flow

156

cytometry. Two weeks following the boost (week 5), both TH1 and TH2 cytokines were detected (Fig. 3a).

157

In assessing individual cytokines, the TH1 response was comprised mostly of IL-2 and TNF with minimal

158

IFNg production, indicative of a “TH0” phenotype46, 47 (Fig. 3b). Of note, antigen-specific IL-21

159

production and CD40 ligand expression were detected in both CD4 memory and TFH-gated PMBC

160

subsets, supporting their role in the robust antibody responses induced following vaccination (Fig. 3c). To

161

further analyze cytokine production on a single cell-basis, Boolean gating was used to show the various

162

combinations of cytokines (Fig. 3D). Greater than ~89% were CD40L+, a sensitive marker for antigen

163

specific cells. Notably, just 6.5% of cells produced only TH2 cytokines, while ~27% produced

164

combinations of IL-2 or TNF, and IL-4 or IL-13, characterized as a mixed or “TH0” phenotype. CD8 T

165

cell responses were largely undetectable (Fig. 3e).

166
167

Soluble spike trimers adjuvanted with AS03 protect NHP from high dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge

168

Prior NHP vaccine studies25, 48 have used varying doses of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate ranging from 104

169

to 106 PFU for nasal and intratracheal challenge. In addition, passaging of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate has

170

led to mutations in the furin cleavage site that can limit pathogenicity and results in variation of the

171

amount and duration of infection in NHP. Thus, in this study, NHP were challenged 3 weeks following

172

the boost with a new sequence-validated stock of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate that was administered at a

173

high dose of 3x106 PFU SARS-CoV-2 given intranasally and intratracheally. Lower airway protection

174

was assessed using subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), as a quantitative metric of replicating virus49 in BAL

175

(Fig. 4a). At day 2, 6/7 (86%) PBS control animals had detectable sgRNA, compared to 6/8 (75%) and

176

3/8 (38%) in the 4 µg and 12 µg dose groups, respectively. By day 4, 5/7 (71%) of PBS control animals

177

were positive, but sgRNA was significantly reduced to 2/8 (25%) or 0/8 (0%) in the 4 µg and 12 µg

178

vaccine dose groups, respectively. By day 7, sgRNA was detectable in 4/7 (57%) PBS controls but only

179

1/16 (6%) vaccinated animals. To assess upper airway protection, sgRNA was quantified in nasal swab

180

extracts (Fig. 4b). Both vaccine groups showed significant sgRNA reduction of ~1-3 Log10 on day 2. By

181

day 4, 5/7 (71%) PBS controls had detectible sgRNA (104), while only 2/8 (25%) and 0/8 (0%)

182

vaccinated NHP had detectable sgRNA in the 4 µg and 12 µg dose groups, respectively. Thus, AS03-

183

adjuvanted preS dTM provided significant protection in the upper and lower airways from this robust

184

SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

186

To further substantiate the vaccine protection, lung tissue was analyzed for viral antigen, inflammation,

187

and eosinophil infiltration in half of the animals in each group 7 days following challenge (Fig. 4c-e).

188

Viral antigen was detected in at least 1 lobe of 3/4 PBS control animals, while antigen was undetectable

189

in the high-dose vaccinated animals and had only limited detection in 2 of the low-dose vaccinated

190

animals. Vaccination at either dose trended to reduce both tissue inflammation (Fig. 4d) and the presence

191

of eosinophils (Fig. 4f), though these observations did not reach statistical significance.

192
193

SARS-CoV-2 challenge boosts antibody titers in the lung

194

To further investigate how T cells or antibodies may have influenced protection in the respiratory tissues,

195

we assessed T cell responses in the BAL and PBMC and antibody responses in the serum, BAL and nasal

196

washes at various time points post challenge. Compared to the peak T cell responses after the second

197

immunization at week 5 (restimulated with S peptides, Fig. 3a,b) memory PBMC CD4 and CD8 T cell

198

responses were largely unchanged 7 to 14 days post challenge (Fig. S3a,b). However in BAL samples,

199

spike-specific IL-2, IFNg, and IL-13 recall responses were increased in the vaccinated groups compared

200

to week 5, but not in the PBS controls (Fig. S3c,d). To assess the primary T cell response to infection,

201

cells were restimulated with peptides to nucleoprotein, which is not present in the vaccine. Here we noted

202

that the SARS-CoV-2 challenge induced a strong TH1 response in the BAL but not in PBMCs by day 14

203

that was specific to the PBS control animals (Fig. S3e,f). These data suggest that vaccine-elicited immune

204

responses controlled the infection before a detectable primary T cell response could be generated in BAL

205

or PBMCs.

206
207

Because vaccinated animals showed no detectable primary N-specific T cell response to the challenge in

208

BAL or PBMCs, it suggested rapid control of infection by the vaccine in the airways, which we

209

hypothesized might be mediated by antibodies. To assess this, we performed a kinetic analysis of

210

antibody responses in BAL and nasal washes up to two weeks post challenge. Remarkably, S-2P IgG

211

binding titers were significantly increased in the BAL from vaccinated animals just 2 days post challenge

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.02.433390; this version posted March 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

212

and remained higher than the control animals through day 7 (Fig. 5a). In contrast, IgA and IgG responses

213

to the challenge developed only by day 14 in the PBS control animals consistent with the kinetics of a

214

primary response (Fig. 5a,b). Notably this anamnestic response in the vaccinated animals was specific to

215

the BAL, as there was no increase in S-2P IgG titers in the nasal wash (Fig. 5c) or the serum (Fig. 5d)

216

post challenge. Importantly, the primary antibody response was evident in blood and upper and lower

217

airways by day 14 in the PBS control animals. Based on the rapid anamnestic response in BAL in the

218

vaccine groups, we next determined whether this was specific to S-2P antibodies, or if the challenge was

219

causing a general increase in IgG. Indeed, there was an increase in total IgG in BAL of vaccinated

220

animals at 2 days post challenge, continuing through day 4 and decreasing by day 7, while PBS control

221

animals had a smaller increase on day 4 only (Fig. S4a). We next assessed whether other antibody

222

specificities were increased in BAL post challenge. Because all NHP used in our studies have had earlier

223

vaccination against measles, we assessed measles antibody titers in BAL. Consistent with increases in

224

spike and total IgG titers in BAL, vaccinated animals similarly showed a significant increase in measles

225

antibodies on days 2 and 4 compared to pre-challenge, while several PBS control animals also increased

226

on day 4 (Fig. S4b). Finally, to assess whether this increase in total IgG could be due to increased general

227

transudation into the lung from the serum, we assessed the serum protein albumin levels in BAL.

228

Albumin levels in BAL were not significantly increased in the vaccinated or PBS control animals

229

following SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Fig. S4c). These data show that SARS-CoV-2 challenge leads to a

230

rapid and transient local increase in IgG that occurs earlier in vaccinated animals.

231
232

Vaccine induced IgG is sufficient to confer protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge

233

Based on the high antibody and neutralizing titers in the blood and rapid anamnestic antibody responses

234

in the BAL following challenge, we hypothesized that IgG was mediating protection. To directly assess

235

whether vaccine induced antibody was sufficient to mediate protection, NHP IgG was purified from

236

pooled plasma three weeks following the second vaccination just prior to the challenge and passively

237

transferred to hamsters (Fig. 6a). A total of 10 mg or 2 mg total IgG per animal from AS03-adjvuanted

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.02.433390; this version posted March 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

238

preS dTM vaccinated NHP or from animals prior to vaccination as a negative control was administered to

239

8 individual hamsters per group. This resulted in approximately 125 mg and 25 mg IgG/kg bodyweight

240

for the 10 and 2 mg dose groups, respectively (Fig. S5a). PBS was administered to an additional group as

241

a negative control, and the highly potent and clinically approved SARS-CoV-2 mAb, LY-CoV55550 was

242

administered to another group at 10 mg/kg as a positive control. Just prior to challenge, serum S-2P titers

243

were confirmed in all but 2 animals, which were subsequently excluded (Fig. S5 b,c). Notably, the LY-

244

CoV555 mAb recipient animals had higher ELISA binding titers than those that received polyclonal post-

245

vaccination IgG. Hamsters that received only PBS prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge lost an average of 10-

246

15% of their bodyweight at day 6, a primary outcome measure of disease progression (Fig. 6b,

247

Supplementary Table 2). Hamsters that received 10 mg of post-vaccination IgG had little weight loss and

248

gained weight at a rate almost equivalent to that of the LY-CoV555 recipient hamsters. This protection

249

was dose-dependent, as the animals that received 2 mg of post-vaccination IgG showed weight loss of

250

~7% by day 6. Finally, individual animal serum S-2P binding titers were strongly correlated with body

251

weight change, confirming the effect of IgG in protection from challenge (Fig. 6c). Taken together, these

252

data show that the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine elicited IgG sufficient to mediate protection in

253

Discussion

255
256

In this study, an AS03-adjuvanted soluble prefusion S protein vaccine formulation produced by Sanofi

257

Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline was evaluated for its ability to protect nonhuman primates against SARS-

258

CoV-2 challenge in advance of clinical trials. Although SARS-CoV-2 mRNA- and adenovirus-based

259

vaccine candidates have been authorized for emergency use in various countries, adjuvanted protein

260

vaccines provide an additional vaccine platform to prevent disease that could be broadly useful in all age

261

groups based on their long history and safety record with other viral infections. A key aspect of these

262

studies was to provide new insights into the mechanisms of protection, most notably in the lung, which is

263

critical for understanding how vaccines limit disease, a primary endpoint in all clinical trials.

264
265

By comparing the immune response to preS dTM formulations with and without AS03, it is clear that

266

AS03 is critical for the induction of protective antibody responses, as has been previously observed with

267

influenza35, 36, 51, 52 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)53. The CD4 responses to spike were primarily

268

TH0 given the relative limited IFNγ production46 and TH2. In mouse studies, IL-4 and IL-13 production

269

was also observed following vaccination with an inactivated influenza/AS03 formuation54. Previous

270

human studies of AS03 with hepatitis B surface antigen55 and influenza hemagglutinin56 have observed

271

strong IL-2 and TNF production with lower IFNγ responses. However, IFNγ responses were recently

272

documented in humans with AS03 and a similar antigen (SCB-2019)57, suggesting that the CD4 profile

273

might differ depending on the species and the antigen. Based on mouse and other animal models, vaccine-

274

induced TH2 responses have been proposed to contribute to enhanced respiratory disease (ERD)58, 59, 60 as

275

was observed in children given inactivated measles61 and RSV62 vaccines. Similarly, SARS vaccines

276

formulated with the TH2-skewing adjuvant, alum, have been reported to induce immunopathology

277

following challenge in mice, including eosinophilia63. Other studies suggest ERD is driven by

278

nonfunctional and poorly matured antibodies58, 64, 65. Regardless of the mechanism, and in contrast to

279

those findings, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge there was limited evidence of viral infection and there

280

was a trend toward lower inflammation and eosinophil infiltration in lung tissue from vaccinated animals

281

compared to PBS controls, indicating no enhanced disease.

282
283

A major focus of this study was to fully characterize the magnitude, quality and location of antibody

284

responses. The NHP model has been used extensively for COVID-19 vaccine development and shares

285

characteristics of mild human disease. Thus, a major advantage of using NHP is the ability to analyze

286

immune responses in the mucosa of the upper and lower airways. Regarding the magnitude of antibody

287

responses, pseudo- and live virus- neutralization titers were above 103 in most animals 2 weeks after the

288

second immunization of AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM. These responses are comparable to prior studies

289

using similar assays following 100 µg of the mRNA nanoparticle vaccines, mRNA127328 and

290

BNT162b248 and importantly are superior to those from convalescent humans.

291
292

The AS03-adjvuanted preS dTM was able to rapidly reduce viral replication in both the upper and lower

293

airways (BAL) by day 2, with no detectable virus in any of the animals in the high dose group by day 4.

294

Comparing these results to other vaccines is difficult based on differences in the challenge stock dose and

295

virulence. Here we have used a high challenge dose of 3x106 PFU, which is 5-200 fold higher than the

296

doses used to evaluate mRNA127328, Ad26.COV2-S25, ChAdOx1 nCoV-1943, and NVX-CoV237342, but

297

similar to that used for BNT162b248. The relatively higher challenge dose used here may in part explain

298

why there was not complete reduction in viral titers at day 2, as was observed with other vaccines tested

299

in NHP using lower challenge doses. Similarly we observed nasal swab titers of ~2x106 sgRNA

300

copies/mL in the control animals at day 2, 10-50 fold higher than previously reported in other NHP

301

studies by us and others28, 43, likely reflecting both the more virulent challenge and improved sgRNA

302

extraction methods.

303
304

Because significant protection was conferred by vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM, it was

305

critical to investigate the potential mechanisms for this effect. Consistent with data from most protein

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.02.433390; this version posted March 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

306

subunit vaccine studies in humans with AS03 and other adjuvants, CD8 T cell responses were

307

undetectable. These data suggest they would have a limited role in primary, rapid protection in this

308

model. By contrast, potent antigen-specific CD4 T cells were comprised of Th0, TH2 and TFH cytokines

309

and expressed CD40L, which are optimal for generating robust antibody responses. In terms of having

310

effector functions to mediate protection, a direct protective role of CD4 T cells would have required cell

311

depletion prior to challenge and was not assessed in this study.

312
313

Based on the early control of infection seen by day 2, it is likely that antibodies had a significant role in

314

neutralizing replicating virus. That neutralizing antibodies could protect against challenge has been shown

315

in correlative analyses with other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates28, 66. Moreover, prior studies have

316

shown a protective effect from passively transferred convalescent sera to hamsters67 and NHP68.

317

However, here is the first demonstration that vaccine-elicited IgG could protect against challenge,

318

providing direct evidence that antibodies are sufficient to mediate protection. An additional finding that

319

substantiates a role for antibodies was the rapid increase in IgG responses in the lung as early as 2 days

320

following challenge in NHP. Mucosal antibody responses to vaccination have been well documented,

321

including in response to polio69, 70, 71, influenza72, 73 and RSV74, 75 vaccines. Moreover, neutralizing BAL

322

responses have been observed in humans in the initial days after symptom onset76. However, to the best of

323

our knowledge, this is the first report of vaccine-directed anamnestic lung responses to challenge. This

324

rapid increase in spike IgG appears specific to the BAL compartment and was not observed in the upper

325

airway or serum post-challenge. A notable finding was that there was also a transient increase in total IgG

326

titers and measles antibody from prior vaccination in the BAL at day 2, yet albumin levels were not

327

increased. These data suggest that the increase in antibodies may not be due to a general transudation of

328

proteins from increased vascular leakage or bulk vesicular transport. We speculate that this increase in

329

total and antigen-specific IgG could occur through a general activation of memory B cells in the lung,

330

perhaps directly from TLR-sensing of viral RNA77 or through bystander activation from activated S-

331

specific CD4 T cells. Together this could explain why IgG titers were higher in vaccinated animals on day

332

2, while PBS controls showed a smaller increase in total and measles IgG only on day 4. While antibody

333

secreting cell (ASC) enumeration was not possible in this study, future studies will examine changes in

334

lung resident ASCs and investigate whether an increase in BAL antibodies is specific to this vaccine or is

335

generalizable to other vaccine platforms. Nevertheless, these data highlight the potential role of ASCs in

336

contributing to control of viral infections in the lung.

337
338

In conclusion, this report highlights that potent serum antibody responses are induced by soluble S trimers

339

formulated with the oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant AS03, which conferred protection in the upper and

340

lower airways following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. This vaccine induced IgG responses sufficient to

341

protect from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and the rapid anamnestic response in the lower airway likely

342

contributed to protection at this site. These data support the clinical development of the AS03-adjuvanted

343

preS dTM vaccine for limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and protecting against COVID-19 morbidity and

344

mortality.

Materials and Methods

346
347

Immunogen

348

The SARS-CoV-2 recombinant vaccine candidate consists of purified recombinant prefusion spike (S)

349

protein (SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S delta TM (preS dTM)) adjuvanted with AS03.

350

The preS dTM was produced from a Sanofi Pasteur proprietary cell culture technology based on the insect

351

cell – baculovirus system, referred to as the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS). The preS

352

dTM sequence was designed based on the Wuhan YP_009724390.1 strain S sequence, but modified to

353

improve the conformation, stability, trimerization and facilitate the purification. The modifications

354

comprise mutation of the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, introduction of two proline mutations in the C-

355

terminal region of S2 domain, deletion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region and replacement by

356

the T4-foldon trimerization domain24. Briefly, the modified sequence was cloned into a baculovirus

357

transfer plasmid, which was then used to generate a recombinant baculovirus containing the gene of

358

interest. The recombinant baculovirus was first amplified in expresSF+ insect cells prior to infecting a

359

large scale expresSF+ insect cells culture in suspension. After incubation, the recombinant protein was

360

purified from the supernatant using several affinity and chromatography columns. Based on an ACE2

361

binding assay, the preS dTM used in the study were quantified at 4 µg and 12 µg for a total protein

362

content of 5 and 15 µg, for the low and high doses respectively.

363
364

Adjuvant and formulation

365

AS03 is an Adjuvant System composed of a-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80 in an oil-in-water

366

emulsion78. Vaccine doses were formulated by diluting the appropriate dose of preS dTM with PBS-tween

367

to 250 µL, then mixing with 250 µL AS03, followed by inversion five times for a final volume of 500 µL.

368

Each dose of AS03 contains 11.86 mg a-tocopherol, 10.69 mg squalene and 4.86 mg polysorbate-80

369

(Tween 80) in PBS.

Animals, immunizations, challenges and sampling

372

Rhesus macaques were randomized into groups of 8 based on age and body weight; each group had 2

373

females and 6 males, except for the PBS control group, which only had 5 males. All animals had a history

374

of measles vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulations were administered by intramuscular injection

375

into the right deltoid for both immunizations, three weeks apart. Whole blood was collected weekly into

376

EDTA-containing tubes and also 1, 4 and 7 days after each immunization for complete blood

377

count/chemistry profiling. PBMC and plasma were then collected from whole blood following ficoll

378

purification. For SARS-CoV-2 challenge, virus was obtained from Operation Warp Speed: strain- 2019-

379

nCoV/USA-WA1/2020, Lot# 70038893; BEI resources catalog no. NR-53780. Virus was inoculated

380

intranasally (0.5 mL per nostril) and intratracheally (3 mL) for a total of 3x106 PFU per animal.

381

Bronchiolar/alveolar lavage (BAL) sampling was performed 5 weeks after vaccination and 2, 4 and 7

382

days after challenge. Nasal swabs for sgRNA PCR were taken 5 weeks after vaccination and 2, 4 and 7

383

days after challenge; nasal washes (~5 mL PBS) were collected at weeks 0 and 5, and 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14

384

days post challenge. Half the animals in each group were necropsied at day 7 and 14 post challenge,

385

where lung tissue was collected for histopathology.

386
387

In a separate study, 4 groups of 6 rhesus macaques were similarly vaccinated, but with lower doses of 1.3

388

and 3.9 µg preS dTM + AS03, or 3.9 µg preS dTM without AS03, or PBS alone. Animals were then

389

boosted at week 3 with 2 and 6.1 µg preS dTM + AS03, or 6.1 µg preS dTM without AS03, or PBS alone.

390

Immunogenicity data from this study are found in Figure S2. IgG were purified from animals given 3 µg

391

preS dTM + AS03 either before immunization or 3 weeks following the second immunization for use in

392

passive transfer to hamsters, Figure 6.

393
394

For passive transfer studies, 6–8-week-old Golden Syrian hamsters were randomized into groups of 8

395

based on weight, each group having 4 males and 4 females. IgG was passively transferred by

398

of 3x104 PFU administered in a final volume of 100 µL and split between each nostril. Body weight and

399

clinical observations were made daily; serum was sampled just prior to challenge; oral swabs were taken

411

Human convalescent sera

412

Two panels of samples from human patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 disease were used in

413

parallel. The first panel referred to as “NIH” has been described previously28. Additionally, an 18-sample

414

panel collected by Operation Warp Speed and distributed by Battelle and BEI Resources was also used,

415

referred to here as “OWS”. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants had a

416

history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before they provided serum.

417
418

Serology

419

Antibody titers to various SARS-CoV-2 derived antigens were assayed as previously described28. Briefly,

420

endpoint binding titers were measured by standard sandwich ELISA using proline-stabilized spike protein

421

(S-2P). Binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1, receptor-binding domain (RBD), and N-terminal domain (NTD)

422

spike subdomains was performed using Mesoscale Discovery ELISA28, using biotinylated subdomain

423

proteins prepared as described previously79.

424
425

Total IgG antibody titers were quantitated by using the Human IgG ELISA BASIC kit

426

(ALP) (Mabtech) following manufactures directions. Samples were read by MSD plate reader (Sector

427

Imager 600). Antibody titers to measles were quantitated by using Monkey Anti-Measles IgG ELISA kit

428

(Alpha Diagnostics International) following manufactures directions. The optical density (OD) of each

429

well was read at 450 nm by SpectraMax Paradigm Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular

430

Devices). Albumin levels were measured by bead-based single-plex assay using Luminex. The albumin

431

analyte was selected and measured using MILLIPLEX MAP Human Kidney Injury Magnetic Bead Panel

432

2 (Millipore Sigma) following manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence data were collected on MAGPIX

433

with Bio-Plex ManagerTM MP software (BioRad).

434
435

ACE2 binding inhibition was also performed via Mesoscale Discovery 384-well, 4-Spot Custom Serology

436

SECTOR plates precoated with RBD; plasma was applied at a starting dilution of 1:10 followed by 10-

437

fold serial dilutions. Binding was detected with SULFO-TAG–labeled ACE2 (Meso Scale Diagnostics).

438
439

For avidity analyses, plasma samples were heated at 56 °C for 45 min to complement-inactivate and

440

reduce potential risk from any residual virus and immediately used or stored at -80°C for later use. 96-

441

well plates (Nunc MaxisorpTM, Thermo Fisher) were coated with 100 µL of 1 µg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S-2P

442

in 1x PBS for 16 hrs at 4°C. Plates were washed 3x in washing buffer (1x PBS, 0.2% Tween20, pH 7.4)

443

using a Biotek 405 Microplate Washer and blocked with 200 µL blocking buffer (1 x PBS-T: 0.14 M

444

NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.010 M PO43-, pH 7.4) for 2 hrs at RT and washed 3x.

445

Plasma/serum samples were serially diluted (starting dilution 1:100 and 4-fold dilutions) in blocking

446

buffer and 100 µL was transferred to the plates. After 1 hour of incubation, plates were washed, and half

447

of the samples were then incubated with 100 µL 1x PBS while the other half of the paired samples were

448

treated with 100 µL 1.0 M sodium thiocyanate solution (NaSCN, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes at room

449

temperature (RT) and washed 6x. Plates were incubated for 1 hr with 100 µL of goat-anti-human IgG

450

(H+L, Cat#PA1-8463) or goat-anti-monkey IgG (H+L, Cat#A18811) secondary antibody conjugated to

451

horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Thermo Fisher) in blocking buffer at 1:10,000 or 1:4,000 dilution,

452

respectively. Plates were washed 3x and developed by addition of 100 µL KPL SureBlueTM TMB

453

Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (1-Component, SeraCare, Cat#52-00-01) for 10 min. The reaction was

454

quenched by addition of 100 µL 1 N H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at a test wavelength of 450

455

nm and reference wavelength of 650 nm using SoftMax Pro software version 6.5 on a Spectramax

456

Paradigm Microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The avidity index (AI) was calculated using the ratio of

457

the NaSCN-treated serum dilution giving an OD of 0.5 to the PBS-treated serum dilution giving an OD of

458

0.5 after 5PL curve-fitting in Graphad Prism. Reported AI is the average of two independent experiments,

459

each containing duplicate samples. Samples with an OD < 0.5 could not be interpolated and were

460

excluded from analysis.

461
462

To produce SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus, a codon-optimized CMV/R-SARS-CoV-2 S (Wuhan-1,

463

GenBank: MN908947.3) plasmid was constructed and subsequently modified via site-directed

464

mutagenesis to contain the D614G mutation. Further mutations were integrated into the D614G

465

background to recapitulate the spike mutations of both the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (RSA) variants.

466

Pseudoviruses were produced by co-transfecting HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC CRL-11268) with plasmids

467

encoding a luciferase reporter, a lentivirus backbone, and the SARS-CoV-2 S genes into HEK293T/17

468

cells (ATCC CRL-11268) as previously described80. A human transmembrane protease serine 2

469

(TMPRSS2) plasmid was co-transfected to produce pseudovirus81. Neutralizing antibody responses in

470

sera were assessed by pseudoneutralization assay as previously described3, 22. Briefly, heat-inactivated

471

sera were serially diluted in duplicate, mixed with pseudovirus previously titrated to yield 104 RLU, and

472

incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for roughly 45 minutes. 293T-hACE2.mF cells were diluted to a

473

concentration of 7.5 x 104 cells/mL in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum

474

(FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and added to the sera-pseudovirus mixture. Seventy-two hours

475

later, cells were lysed and luciferase activity (in relative light units (RLU)) was measured using a

476

SpectraMaxL (Molecular Devices) luminometer. Percent neutralization was normalized, considering

477

uninfected cells as 100% neutralization and cells infected with pseudovirus alone as 0% neutralization.

478

ID50 titers were determined using a log(agonist) vs. normalized-response (variable slope) nonlinear

479

regression model in Prism v8 (GraphPad).

480
481

For neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, a focus reduction neutralization titer (FRNT) assay

482

was performed as previously described82. Plasma/serum were serially diluted (three-fold) in serum-free

483

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) in duplicate wells and incubated with 100–200 FFU

484

infectious clone derived SARS-CoV-2-mNG virus83 at 37 °C for 1 h. The antibody-virus mixture was

485

added to VeroE6 cell (C1008, ATCC, #CRL-1586) monolayers seeded in 96-well blackout plates and

486

incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Post-incubation, the inoculum was removed and replaced with pre-warmed

487

complete DMEM containing 0.85% methylcellulose. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h,

488

methylcellulose overlay was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2%

489

paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. at room temperature. Following fixation, plates were washed twice

490

with PBS and foci were visualized on a fluorescence ELISPOT reader (CTL ImmunoSpot S6 Universal

491

Analyzer) and enumerated using Viridot84. The neutralization titers were calculated as follows: 1 - (ratio

492

of the mean number of foci in the presence of sera and foci at the highest dilution of respective sera

493

sample). Each specimen was tested in two independent assays performed at different times. The FRNT-

494

mNG50 titers were interpolated using a 4-parameter nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism

495

8.4.3. Samples with an FRNT-mNG50 value that was below the limit of detection were plotted at 10. For

496

these samples, this value was used in fold reduction calculations.

Cryopreserved PBMC were stained for antigen-specific B cells and subsets (Figure S6) using the

500

following panel: IgM BUV395 (clone G20-127, Becton Dickenson), CD8 BUV665 (clone RPAT8, BD),

501

CD56 BUV737 (clone NCAM16, BD), IgD FITC (Southern Biotech), IgA Dy405 (polyclonal, Jackson

502

Immunoresearch), aqua LIVE/DEAD (Invitrogen), CD14 BV785 (clone M5E2, BioLegend), CD20

503

Alexa700-PE (clone 2H7, vaccine research center), IgG Alexa700 (clone G18-145, BD), CD3 Cy7APC

504

(clone SP34-2, BD Pharmingen). Biotinylated prefusion-stabilized spike (S-2P) and spike subdomain

505

(NTD, RBD) probes were produced as previously described79 and conjugated to streptavidin-labeled dyes

506

(BD) to yield the following and streptavidin-conjugated B cell probes, NTD SA-BB700 (BD), RBD SA-

507

BV650 (BD), and S-2P SA-APC (BD). PBMC were thawed into cRPMI + 10% FBS85, washed with PBS,

508

and stained with aqua LIVE/DEAD kit in PBS for 20 min. at 4 °C. Staining was then completed with the

509

remainder of the antibody and probe cocktail described above for 45 min. at 4 °C, and washed twice with

510

PBS before flow cytometry.

512

Intracellular Cytokine Staining

513

To measure vaccine-specific T cell responses, cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and rested overnight in

514

a 37C/5% CO2 incubator. The next morning, cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1

515

peptide pools, JPT Peptide Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml in the presence of

516

monensin and costimulatory antibodies anti-CD28 and -49d (clones CD28.2 and 9F10, BD Biosciences)

517

for 6 hours. Negative controls received an equal concentration of DMSO (instead of peptides) and co-

518

stimulatory antibodies. Intracellular cytokine staining and gating for CD4, CD8 was performed as

519

previously described86 except the following monoclonal antibodies were added: PD-1 BUV737 (clone

520

EH12.1, BD Biosciences) in place of PD-1 BV785, TNF-FITC (clone Mab11, BD Biosciences) in place

521

of IL-5 BB515, and CD154 (CD40L) BV785 (clone 24-31, BioLegend). TFH subsets were gated as

522

CXCR5+, PD-1+, ICOS+. Aqua LIVE/DEAD kit (Invitrogen) was used to exclude dead cells. All

523

antibodies were previously titrated to determine the optimal concentration.

Flow cytometry

526

All phenotyping and ICS data were acquired on an BD FACSymphony flow cytometer and analyzed

527

using FlowJo version 9.9.6 (Treestar, Inc., Ashland, OR).

529

Luminex Isotype and FcR Binding Assay

530

To determine relative concentrations of antigen-specific antibody isotypes and Fc-receptor binding

531

activity in the rhesus samples, a customized Luminex isotype assay was performed as previously

532

described87. Antigens including SARS-CoV-2 full length spike (Eric Fischer, DFCI) and RBD (kindly

533

provided by Aaron Schmidt, Ragon Institute) were covalently coupled to Luminex microplex

534

carboxylated bead regions (Luminex Corporation) using NHS-ester linkages with Sulfo-NHS and EDC

535

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer recommendations. Immune complexes were formed

536

by incubating antigen-coupled beads with diluted samples while rotating overnight. Mouse-anti-rhesus

537

antibody detectors were then added for each antibody isotype (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, NIH

538

Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource supported by AI126683 and OD010976). Then, tertiary anti-

539

mouse-IgG detector antibodies conjugated to PE were added. Flow cytometry was performed using a an

540

iQue Plus Screener (Intellicyt) with a robot arm (PAA). Analysis of the flow cytometry data was

541

performed using iQue Intellicyt software.

542
543

Systems serology

544

In order to quantify antibody functionality of plasma samples, bead-based assays were used to measure

545

antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP)

546

and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD), as previously described88, 89, 90. SARS-CoV-2

547

spike protein (kindly provided by Eric Fischer, DFCI) was coupled to fluorescent streptavidin beads

548

(Thermo Fisher) and incubated with diluted plasma samples to allow antibody binding to occur. For

549

ADCP, cultured human monocytes (THP-1 cell line, ATCC) were incubated with immune complexes to

550

induce phagocytosis. For ADNP, primary PMBCs were isolated from whole blood from healthy donors

551

using an ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer. After phagocytosis of immune complexes,

552

neutrophils were stained with an anti-CD66b Pacific Blue detection antibody (Biolegend). For detection

553

of complement deposition, lyophilized guinea pig complement (Cedarlane) was reconstituted according to

554

manufacturer’s instructions and diluted in a gelatin veronal buffer with calcium and magnesium (Boston

555

BioProducts). After antibody-dependent complement deposition occurred, C3 bound to immune

556

complexes was detected with FITC-Conjugated Goat IgG Fraction to Guinea Pig Complement C3 (MP

557

Biomedicals).

558
559

For quantification of antibody-dependent NK cell activation91, diluted plasma samples were incubated in

560

Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with antigen. Human NK cells were isolated the

561

evening before using RosetteSep Human NK cell Enrichment cocktail (STEMCELL Technologies) from

562

healthy buffy coat donors and incubated overnight with human recombinant Interleukin 15 (IL-15)

563

(STEMCELL Technologies). NK cells were incubated with immune complexes, CD107a PE-Cy5 (BD),

564

Golgi stop (BD) and Brefeldin A (BFA, Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation, cells were stained using anti-

565

CD16 APC-Cy7 (BD), anti-CD56 PE-Cy7 (BD) and anti-CD3 Pacific Blue (BD), and then fixed (Perm

566

A, Life Tech). Intracellular staining occurred with anti-IFNγ FITC (BD) and anti-MIP-1β PE (BD) after

567

permeabilizing the NK cells with Perm B (Thermo Fisher). Flow cytometry acquisition of all assays was

568

performed using the iQue Screener Plus (Intellicyt) and an S-LAB robot (PAA). For ADCP, phagocytosis

569

events were gated on bead-positive cells. For ADNP, neutrophils were identified by gating on CD66b+

570

cells, phagocytosis was identified by gating on bead-positive cells. A phagocytosis score for ADCP and

571

ADNP was calculated as (percentage of bead-positive cells) x (MFI of bead-positive cells) divided by

572

10,000. ADCD quantification was reported as MFI of FITC-anti-C3. For antibody-dependent NK

573

activation, NK cells were identified by gating on CD3-, CD16+ and CD56+ cells. Data were reported as

574

the percentage of cells positive for CD107a, IFNγ, and MIP-1β.

Quantification of subgenomic RNA following challenge

577

Nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid were collected 2, 4, and 7 days post-challenge. At

578

the time of collection, nasal swabs were frozen in 1mL of PBS containing 1 μL of SUPERase-In RNase

579

Inhibitor (Invitrogen) and frozen at -80 °C until extraction. Nasal specimens were thawed at 55 °C, and

580

the swab removed. The remaining PBS was mixed with 2 mL of RNAzol BD (Molecular Research

581

Center) and 20 μL acetic acid. At the time of collection, 1 mL of BAL fluid was mixed with 1 mL of

582

RNAzol BD containing 10 μL acetic acid and frozen at -80 °C until extraction. BAL specimens were

583

thawed at room temperature and mixed with an additional 1 mL of RNAzol BD containing 10 μL acetic

584

acid.

585
586

Total RNA was extracted from nasal specimens and BAL fluid using RNAzol BD Column Kits

587

(Molecular Research Center) and eluted in 65 μL H20. Subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 E (envelope) mRNA

588

was quantified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a technique similar to that described

589

previously1. Reactions were conducted with 5 μL RNA and TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix

590

(Applied Biosystems) with 500 nM primers and 200 nM probes. Primers and probes were as follows:

591
592

sgLeadSARSCoV2_F: 5’-CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC-3’

593
594

E_Sarbeco_P: 5’-FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-BHQ1-3’

595

E_Sarbeco_R: 5’-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3’

596
597

Reactions were run on a QuantStudio 6 Pro Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) at the

598

following conditions: 50 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 20 sec, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and 60 °C for 1

599

min. Absolute quantification was performed in comparison to a standard curve. For the standard curve,

600

the E subgenomic mRNA sequence was inserted into a pcDNA3.1 vector (Genscript) and transcribed

601

using MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) followed by MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up

602

Kit (Invitrogen). The lower limit of quantification was 50 copies.

603
604

Histopathology

605

Histopathological analyses were performed as described previously28. Immunohistochemistry was used to

606

visualize SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (rabbit polyclonal, GeneTex), and eosinophils by staining

607

for eosinophil peroxidase (rabbit polyclonal, Atlas Antibodies). Inflammation was scored on the

608

following scale based on % tissue affected: 0, 0%; 1, <10%; 2, 10-25%; 3, 26-50%; 4, >50%. Viral

609

antigen from IHC was scored on the following scale: 0, minimal to absent; 1, minimally abundant but

610

clearly present; 2, mildly abundant; 3, moderately abundant; 4, abundant. Eosinophils from IHC were

611

scored on the following scale: 0, within normal limits; 1, minimal increase; 2, mild increase; 3, moderate

612

increase; 4, abundant.

613
614

Statistics

615

All statistical analyses were performed in Prism (version 8.4, GraphPad). For comparisons between NHP

616

vaccine groups at a single time point or dilution, a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons

617

test was performed. For comparisons over a time course, a 2-way ANOVA was employed with the

618

Geisser-Greenhouse correction and the Tukey test to correct for multiple comparisons (Sidak’s test was

619

used for comparing only two groups over a dilution series). For T cell assays a mixed-effect model with

620

the Geisser-Greenhouse correction and a Tukey test was used, as not all samples were available at each

621

time point. For comparisons of viral load in NHP and viral load and weight loss in hamsters over time, a

622

2-way ANOVA was employed with the Geisser-Greenhouse correction and a Dunnett test to correct for

623

multiple comparisons, with comparisons to the PBS control group only. For comparisons of NHP titers

624

post-challenge over time (not all samples were available at the last time point), a mixed-effect model was

625

employed with the Geisser-Greenhouse correction and a Dunnett test, with comparisons controlled to the

week 5 time point. For the weight loss versus binding titer correlation, a Spearman correlation test was

627

performed. All binding titer and viral load data were log-transformed before performing statistical tests.
