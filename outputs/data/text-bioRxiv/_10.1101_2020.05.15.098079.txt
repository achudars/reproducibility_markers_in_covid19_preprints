Abstract

26

We developed a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) subunit recombinant protein vaccine

27

candidate based on a high-yielding, yeast- engineered, receptor-binding domain (RBD219-N1) of the

28

SARS beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein. When formulated with Alhydrogel®, RBD219-N1

29

induced high-level neutralizing antibodies against both pseudotyped virus and a clinical (mouse-adapted)

30

isolate of SARS-CoV. Here, we report that mice immunized with RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® were fully

31

protected from lethal SARS-CoV challenge (0% mortality), compared to ~ 30% mortality in mice when

32

immunized with the SARS S protein formulated with Alhydrogel®, and 100% mortality in negative controls.

33

An RBD219-N1 formulation Alhydrogel® was also superior to the S protein, unadjuvanted RBD, and

AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant)-formulated RBD in inducing specific antibodies and preventing cellular

infiltrates in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. Specifically, a formulation with a 1:25 ratio of RBD219-

36

N1 to Alhydrogel® provided high neutralizing antibody titers, 100% protection with non-detectable viral

37

loads with minimal or no eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. As a result, this vaccine formulation is under

38

consideration for further development against SARS-CoV and potentially other emerging and re-

INTRODUCTION

44

Coronaviruses (CoV) are the enveloped viruses with approximately 30 kb single-strand RNA genomes.

45

CoVs belong to the family Coronaviridae and have been found in various mammals, including bats,

46

pangolins, and civets. Previously, they were known to only cause mild diseases to humans until the

47

pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred between 2002 and 2003 [1-3]. Ever

48

since SARS, nearly every decade, a new major coronavirus outbreak occurred: The Middle East

49

respiratory syndrome caused by MERS-CoV first emerged in 2012 and still is circulating in camels [4]; the

50

current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered in December 2019, and have

51

currently infected more than 10 million worldwide.

52
53

The disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) led to almost 800 deaths and more than 8,000

54

infections, leading to an overall fatality rate of approximately 10 percent. Alarmingly, the fatality rate

55

among older adults exceeded 50 percent [5]. In preparation for future outbreaks and accidental and/or

56

intentional releases of SARS-CoV, intensive efforts have been made to develop vaccines against SARS-

57

CoV.

58
59

For the past two decades, several antigens have been identified and developed as SARS-CoV vaccine

60

candidates. Initially, whole inactivated virus (WIV) or modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing SARS

61

vaccines were developed [5], however, eosinophilic immunopathology was observed in mice and non-

62

human primates immunized with these viral-vectored vaccines [6-11]. Even though historically there

63

have been reports that alum adjuvanted vaccines could induce enhancement, such as in the 1960s with

64

the RSV vaccine or even with WIV and S proteins,[12] it was shown later that alum-adjuvanted WIV

65

elicited less immunopathology than WIV alone [12]. suggesting that alum might reduce immune

66

enhancement, a process possibly linked to mixed Th1, Th17, and Th2 responses [11, 13]. Additional

67

evidence emerged that the virus N protein had a key but not exclusive role in immune enhancement [7,

68

11]. Based on these studies, the recombinant S protein of SARS-CoV was used as a vaccine candidate [5],

69

but the full-length S-protein also induced immunopathology, with epitopes outside of the receptor-

70

binding domain (RBD) of the S protein implicated in eliciting this phenomenon [14, 15]. Therefore, the

71

RBD of the S protein was selected as a substitute for the full-length S protein [16-21].

72
73

Recombinant RBD formulated with Sigma’s adjuvant system® (consisting of Monophosphoryl-lipid

74

A/Trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant, a skewed Th1/Th2 adjuvant) or with Freund's adjuvant

75

(Freund's complete in prime and Freund's incomplete in boost; a Th1/Th2 balanced adjuvant scheme)

76

was shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies and highly protective immunity in the vaccinated animals,

77

while eliminating or significantly reducing eosinophilic immunopathology [18, 20-23]. In our previous

78

studies, we have expressed wild-type RBD193 (residues 318–510) /RBD219 (residues 318–536) in yeast,

79

however, because of the three N glycosylation sites on these two wild-type constructs, we further

80

generated the deglycosylated forms as follows: N1: 1st glycosylation site deleted; N2: 1st glycosylation site

81

deleted and 2nd glycosylation site mutated; and N3: 1st glycosylation site deleted, 2nd and 3rd glycosylation

82

sites mutated. We developed a production process for several of these tag-free yeast-expressed

83

recombinant RBD constructs [24]. Such studies down-selected several candidates and ultimately

84

identifying one, RBD219-N1 (residues 319-536), as a promising vaccine candidate, due to its ability to

85

induce in immunized mice a stronger anti-RBD-specific antibody response and neutralizing antibodies

86

when adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel®). The protein production process [25] was

87

transferred to the Pilot Bioproduction Facility (PBF) at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR),

88

and the clinical grade RBD219-N1 (drug substance) was manufactured under current Good

89

Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and is suitable for further Phase I clinical trials.

90
91

In this work, the RBD219-N1 formulated with Alhydrogel® resulted in significantly increased antigen-

92

specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody responses when compared to other RBD constructs. After

93

challenge with SARS-CoV, 100% of mice immunized with RBD219-N1 survived, while only 89% of mice

94

immunized with other RBD constructs and less than 70% of the mice immunized with SARS-CoV spike

95

protein survived and none survived in the control group. The aluminum formulated RBD minimized

96

immune enhancement compared with other adjuvants formulations with either the RBD or full-length S

97

protein. Finally, an Alhydrogel® dose-ranging study further indicated that by formulating RBD219-N1 with

98

Alhydrogel® at the ratio of 1:25, higher IgG titers could be elicited with no detectable viral load upon

99

challenge.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

102
103

Generation of recombinant yeast-expressed RBD of SARS-CoV

104

The yeast-expressed SARS-CoV RBD193-N1, wt-RBD219, and RBD219-N1 were expressed and purified as

105

previously described [24, 25]. Briefly, 1 mL of P. pastoris X33 seed stock expressing RBD193-N1, wt

106

RBD219, and RBD219-N1 was inoculated into 500 ml BMG (buffered minimal glycerol) medium and the

107

culture was incubated overnight at 30°C with constant shaking at 250 rpm until an OD600 of ~10.

108

Approximately 250 ml of overnight culture were inoculated into 5 L sterile Basal Salt Media or Low Salt

109

medium [24]. Fermentation was maintained at 30°C, pH 5.0 and 30% of dissolved oxygen concentration

110

until the exhaustion of glycerol, and the pH and the temperature were then ramped to 6.5 and 25°C,

111

respectively, over an hour followed by continuous feeding of methanol at 11 ml/L/hr for ~70 hours. The

112

fermentation supernatant (FS) was harvested for further purification. To purify RBD193-N1, wt-RBD219,

113

and RBD219-N1, ammonium sulfate was added to the FS until the molarity reached 2 M. The FS

114

containing 2 M ammonium sulfate was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using Butyl

115

Sepharose HP resin followed by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75 resin [24, 25].

Binding Study

126

One ml of TBS containing 18 to 180 µg RBD219-N1 and 400 µg Alhydrogel® were prepared to study the

127

binding of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel® at different ratios (from 1:2 to 1:22). The prepared RBD219-N1/

128

Alhydrogel® slurry was mixed for one hour to ensure the binding of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel® reached

129

an equilibrium state. The slurry was then centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes, and the supernatant

130

was collected while the Alhydrogel® pellet was resuspended with an equal volume of removed

131

supernatant. The RBD219-N1 protein content in the supernatant fraction and the pellet fraction were

132

then measured using a micro BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MS, USA). Similarly, the presence of

133

RBD219-N1 in the pellet and supernatant fractions was also evaluated using SDS-PAGE. Briefly, after the

134

slurry was centrifuged and separated into pellet and supernatant fractions, the Alhydrogel® pellet was

135

further resuspended with desorption buffer (100 mM sodium citrate, 92 mM dibasic sodium phosphate

136

at pH 8.9) and mixed for 1 hour. The desorbed RBD was then separated from Alhydrogel ® by

137

centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 5 minutes. Ten microliters of desorbed RBD from the pellet fraction and

138

free RBD in the supernatant fraction were loaded on 4-20% Tris-glycine gels and stained by Coomassie

139

blue.

Study Design

150

Three sets of pre-clinical studies were conducted to evaluate: (1) different yeast-expressed recombinant

151

antigens, including RBD193-N1, wt-RBD219, and RBD219-N1), and spike protein vaccine as a control; (2)

152

two of the most common adjuvants used in licensed vaccines, Alhydrogel®® and AddaVax (MF59-like

153

adjuvant); and (3) two Alhydrogel® doses (1:8 and 1:25 ratios) to formulate RBD219-N1, and spike protein

154

vaccine as a control. Mice were immunized either subcutaneously (s.c.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) followed

155

by two boosters at 21-day intervals. The same route, number, and frequency of immunization were

156

followed among all the groups within the same study. Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15 strain) was used

157

in these studies to challenge the mice. This virus was generated by serially passaged in the respiratory

158

tract of young BALB/c mice, resulting in minimal mutations in only 6 amino acids, and has been reported

159

to show dose-dependent weight loss and mortality as well as associated pulmonary histopathology in

160

BALB/c mice [26], and thus is widely used in a mouse model to evaluate SARS-CoV vaccine and

161

therapeutics. The detailed study designs are described as the following:

Antigens screening. Mice (15 per group) were immunized s.c. with 100 µL yeast-expressed recombinant

166

formulated SARS S protein were used as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Sera from 5

167

mice were collected on day 50 to evaluate the pre-challenge neutralizing antibody titers. All mice were

168

then challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 10x LD50 SARS-CoV MA15 virus (~5.6 logs TCID50) on day 52.

169

Three mice in each group were further sacrificed On days 55 and 56 to determine the viral loads. The

170

remaining 9 mice in each group were used to monitor clinical disease (weight loss) and mortality daily

171

for up to three weeks.

172

Adjuvant screening. Mice (4 per group) were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with 100 µL RBD219-N1

173

formulated with two adjuvants on days 0 (20 µg RBD), 21 (10 µg RBD), and 42 (10 µg RBD). A total of

174

three groups were tested, including RBD219-N1 with 500 µg Alhydrogel® (sometimes referred to in the

175

manuscript as “alum”) in group 1, RBD219-N1 in 50% (v/v) MF59-like adjuvant in group 2. Mice

176

immunized with RBD alone in group 3 were used as a negative control. On day 52, sera were collected

177

to evaluate IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. On day 63, mice were i.n. challenged with SARS-CoV (2x

178

LD50 (~105 TCID50) SARS-CoV (MA-15), and finally, on day 66 and day 69, or day 3 and day 6 post-

179

challenge, lungs from 2 mice were collected for histopathology and viral titration.

180

Alhydrogel® dose range screening. Mice (6 per group) were i.m. immunized with Alhydrogel® formulated

181

RBD219-N1 on days 0 (10 or 20 µg RBD), 21 (10 µg RBD), and 42 (10 µg RBD). In group 1, a formulation

182

of 0.2 mg/mL RBD in 5 mg/mL Alhydrogel® (2.5 mg/mL aluminum) with the dose of 20 µg/10 µg/10 µg of

183

RBD for prime/1st boost/2nd boost was used for immunization, respectively. In group 2, the formulation

184

0.2 mg/mL RBD in 1.6 mg/mL Alhydrogel® (consisted of 0.8 mg/mL aluminum) was tested, more

185

specifically, a dosing regimen of 20 µg/10 µg/10 µg RBD for prime/1st boost/2nd boost was used while

186

in group 3, 10 µg RBD were used for all immunizations. Alhydrogel® alone and pre-formulated SARS-S

187

protein (3 µg) were used in groups 4 and 5, respectively, as negative and positive controls. On day 52,

188

sera were collected to evaluate IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. On day 63, mice were i.n. challenged

189

with SARS-CoV (2x LD50 (~105 TCID50) SARS-CoV (MA-15)), and finally, on day 66 (day 3 post-challenge)

190

and day 70 (day 6 post-challenge), lungs from 3 mice were collected for histopathology and viral titration.

191

ELISA

192

RBD-specific IgG titers of polyclonal sera from the immunized mice were measured by ELISA, as

193

previously described [18, 19, 24]. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were pre-coated with yeast-expressed RBD

194

protein (1 µg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking and then incubating with serially diluted mouse sera,

195

bound IgG antibody was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000), followed by the same

196

protocol as described [18, 19, 24].

197
198

Titration of SARS CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies

199

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then bled from the retro-orbital sinus plexus. After heat

200

inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min, sera were stored at 4 °C. The standard live virus-based

201

microneutralization (MN) assay was used as previously described [12, 27]. Briefly, serially two-fold and

202

duplicate dilutions of individual immune sera were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates with a final

203

volume of 60 μl per well before adding 120 infectious SARS-CoV (MA-15) particle in 60 μl to individual

204

wells. The plates were mixed well and cultured at room temperature for 1 h before transferring 100 μl

205

of the immune serum-virus mixtures into designated wells of confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well

206

microtiter plates. Vero E6 cells cultured with medium with or without virus were included as positive

207

and negative controls, respectively. After cultivation at 37°C for 3 days, individual wells were observed

208

under the microcopy for the status of virus-induced formation of cytopathic effect. The efficacy of

209

individual sera was calculated and expressed as the lowest concentration capable of completely

210

preventing virus-induced cytopathic effect in 100% of the wells.

211
212

Collection of lungs, histology, immunohistochemistry, and virus titration

213

After the SARS-CoV challenge, mice were euthanized on different days depending on the study, and their

214

lungs were removed. Lung lobes were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological

215

examination using either hematoxylin and eosin (for cellular infiltrates) or immunohistochemistry (IHC),

216

specific for eosinophils, as described previously[12, 27]. For virus quantitation, the remaining tissue

217

specimen was processed as previously described [12, 27]. Evaluations for histopathology were done by

218

an experimental human pathologist masked as to the vaccine/dosage of each specimen source;

219

assessment of the extent of pathologic damage and the eosinophilic component of the inflammatory

220

infiltrates was then provided.

221
222

Statistical analysis

223

Neutralizing antibody titers, weight loss, lung virus titers, IgG titers, histopathologic score, and

224

eosinophilic infiltration scores were averaged for each group of mice. T-tests were routinely used to

225

evaluate the statistical variation between two groups.

226
227

RESULTS

228

Vaccine integrity evaluation through binding and point-of-injection studies

229

As a vaccine, recombinant protein antigens alone often do not induce a sufficient immune response,

230

necessitating their evaluation as proteins formulated with adjuvants. When Alhydrogel® is used as an

231

adjuvant, the antigen is typically fully adsorbed to the alum salt to maximize potency. The binding

232

efficiency of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel® was performed to evaluate the minimum RBD219-N1 to

233

Alhydrogel® ratio required to ensure complete protein binding. By measuring the protein content in the

234

supernatant and the pellet fraction after adsorption and centrifugation, the percentage of RBD bound

235

onto Alhydrogel® at different RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel® ratio was determined (Figure 1A). An

236

Alhydrogel® to RBD ratio greater than 7.4 resulted in complete adsorption. SDS-PAGE analysis of a

237

formulation of 0.2 mg/mL RBD with 1.6 mg/mL Alhydrogel® (1:8 ratio) further confirmed that no protein

238

remained in the supernatant fraction after adsorption (Figure 1B).

239
240
241
242

Antigen screening
In this pilot study, we compared safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the various yeast-expressed

243

RBD- and S vaccines [12] using a lethal mouse model of SARS--CoV infection. Figure 2a shows that mice

244

immunized with RBD-219N1 had the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies compared to mice

245

immunized with alum-adjuvanted RBD193-N1, wt-RBD219, and the S protein vaccines. Importantly,

246

endpoint evaluation for mortality has shown that a 100% survival rate was found for mice immunized

247

with alum-adjuvanted RBD219-N1, while mice immunized with alum-adjuvanted wt-RBD219 and

248

RBD193-N1 vaccines showed 88% survival and those immunized with alum-adjuvanted S protein showed

249

only 67% survival. All mice in the TBS control group died within 6 days post-challenge (Figure 2B).

250

Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD219-N1, similar to wt-RBD219 and RBD193-N1, consistently

251

showed less than 10% weight loss throughout the study period, while mice immunized with other alum-

252

formulated vaccines including the S protein showed a maximum of 15-20% weight loss (Figure 2C). This

253

was accompanied by more than a 3-log reduction of infectious viral loads within the lungs when

254

compared to mice vaccinated with TBS/Alhydrogel® (Figures 2D and 2E). None of the mice given

255

TBS/Alhydrogel® produced detectable neutralizing antibodies, whereas their geometric means of lung

256

virus titers were 109.9 and 108.9 TCID50/g on days 1 and 2 post-challenge, respectively. With these results,

257

RBD219-N1 was chosen for further development.

Adjuvant screening

260

It is known that alum (generally a Th2 adjuvant) and MF59 (a Th1/Th2 balanced adjuvant in the form of

261

oil-in-water emulsion) are two of the most common adjuvants used in licensed vaccines with very well-

262

established safety records[28, 29]. In this study, we compared Alhydrogel® and AddaVax (MF59-like

263

adjuvant) for their ability to improve the efficacy of RBD219-N1 in mice. As shown in Figure 3 and

264

Supplementary Table 1, mice immunized with RBD219-N1 formulated with Alhydrogel® produced potent

265

neutralizing antibody responses, resulting in complete protection against a subsequent SARS-CoV

266

infection. In contrast, RBD219-N1 with MF59-like adjuvant-induced high IgG titers (Supplementary Table

267

1) but failed to elicit protective neutralizing antibody responses and did not protect against SARS-CoV

268

infection, as evaluated by the isolation of the infectious virus and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for viral RNA.

269

Unlike MF59-like adjuvant formulated RBD219-N1 and RBD219-N1 alone, we also noted that RBD219-

270

N1 formulated with Alhydrogel® did not induce a cellular infiltration within the lungs (Figure 4 and

271

Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® was

272

potentially both effective and safe, and therefore Alhydrogel® was chosen as the optimal adjuvant and

273

further studied for the dose-ranging study.

278

Although RBD219-N1 formulated on Alhydrogel® at a ratio of 1:25 was effective in immunized animals

279

against lethal SARS-CoV challenge without inducing apparent pulmonary immunopathology, it was of

280

further interest to compare different aluminum ratios, including the efficacy of RBD219-N1 formulated

281

on Alhydrogel® at both 1:25 and 1:8 ratios in mice. Sera were collected 10 days after the last vaccination

282

to test RBD219-N1-specific IgG antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies against live

283

SARS-CoV infections. Results showed that mice immunized with RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® at a 1:25 ratio

284

produced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers and RBD219-N1-specific IgG titers than those

285

vaccinated at a 1:8 ratio (Figure 5A-B). Consistent with the antibody responses, mice immunized with an

286

RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® ratio of 1:25 were completely protected against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV,

287

as indicated by the undetectable infectious virus within the lungs and also a lack of morbidity and

288

mortality (Figure 6). In contrast, infectious virus was recovered from the lungs of mice immunized with

289

a 1:8 ratio of RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® (Groups 2 and 3) by day 5 post-challenge and one mouse from

290

each group died. As expected, mice immunized with Alhydrogel ® alone (Group 4) were not protected

291

against a lethal viral challenge and had detectable virus in the lungs resulting in the death of 2 mice on

292

day 4 post-challenge, while SARS-CoV S protein formulated on Alhydrogel® (Group 5) was also

293

immunogenic and protective against SARS-CoV infection. Histopathologic examination of lung tissues

294

using IHC (specific for eosinophils) revealed minimal eosinophilic infiltration for mice in group 1 (1:25

295

ratio) while somewhat increased infiltration was observed in groups 2 and 3 (1:8 ratio) and the worst

296

eosinophils infiltration was found in the mice immunized with S protein among all groups

297

(Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 7). The results confirm the protective efficacy of RBD219-

298

N1/Alhydrogel®, and its superiority to the S-protein in terms of protection and reduction or prevention

DISCUSSION

304

The RBD of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV, which is responsible for the attachment of the angiotensin-

305

converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and initiates the process for cell binding and entry, has been

306

proven as a promising vaccine candidate [30]. It has been expressed as a recombinant protein with a

307

hexahistidine tag, a GST protein or Fc fragment in several different expression platforms including E. coli,

308

insect cells, and mammalian cells to simplify the purification process and these constructs were shown

309

to trigger neutralizing antibodies and immunity [16, 18-21]. However, an additional tag on a recombinant

310

protein-based vaccine should be avoided because it can potentially trigger an undesired immune

311

response. In our previous studies [24, 25], we have expressed and purified several tag-free recombinant

312

RBD constructs in yeast using a scalable process and discovered that the yeast-expressed RBD219-N1

313

induced a stronger RBD-specific antibody response and a high level of neutralizing antibodies in

314

immunized mice when formulated with Alhydrogel®, and thus, a very promising vaccine candidate. In this

315

study, we conducted for the first time an efficacy study in which we screened several different yeast-

316

expressed RBD proteins and compared them to the S protein as a positive control. RBD219-N1 formulated

317

with Alhydrogel® triggered higher neutralizing titers than the other Alhydrogel®- formulated RBD

318

constructs or the S protein; the RBD219-N1 formulated with Alhydrogel® immunized mice were fully

319

protected with 100% survival rate. The RBD219-N1 construct was further selected for adjuvant screening

320

and adjuvant dose-ranging studies.

321
322

Before testing different adjuvants, we investigated the immunization routes (s.c. and i.m) for RBD219-N1

323

adsorbed to Alhydrogel® by evaluating the IgG antibody responses (Supplementary Figure. 1A),

324

neutralizing antibody titer against SARS pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV infections (Supplementary

325

Figures. 1B and 1C). It was found that both immunization routes were able to induce high titers of specific

326

IgG and neutralizing antibodies against infections of SARS pseudovirus in ACE2/293T cells

327

(Supplementary Figure.1B) and live SARS-CoV in Vero cells (Supplementary Figure.1C). Although the

328

antibody responses induced through the s.c. route were significantly higher than those through the i.m.

329

route, the i.m. route was selected for subsequent adjuvant optimization because i.m. injection of the

330

vaccines containing adjuvants has less chance to induce adverse local effects than s.c. injection[31] and

331

the majority of the clinically used vaccines are administered via the i.m. route [32].

332
333

The superiority of the RBD219-N1 vaccine antigen to the S protein was reflected both in terms of eliciting

334

neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity, and that the alum-adjuvanted RBD219-N1 resulted in

335

little to no cellular or eosinophilic immunopathology compared to either the S-protein or an M59-like

336

adjuvant-formulated RBD219-N1 vaccine. With regards to the former observation, it was previously

337

shown that removal of immune-enhancing epitopes located outside the S-protein RBD domain may result

338

in an immunogen, which is less likely to induce immunopathology [15, 33]. This finding led to the initial

339

selection of the RBD as a vaccine antigen [34]. With regards to adjuvant selection, alum prevented or

340

reduced immune enhancement, a finding that confirms a previous observation for the doubly inactivated

341

virus, viral-like particle vaccines, and S protein[12]. For example, Tseng et al. reported that mice

342

immunized with aluminum-formulated virus-like-particle and inactivated virus vaccines showed less

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098079; this version posted July 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

343

immunopathology than the non-adjuvanted vaccines. Such findings provided the basis for suggesting

344

that eosinophilic immunopathology may occur through mechanisms other than Th2 immunity [35, 36].

345
346

To understand the mechanisms of potential immunopathology linked to SARS vaccines, it’s been shown

347

that high levels of eosinophilic immunopathology were observed with modified vaccinia virus Ankara-

348

based vaccine platform vaccines,[6-11] and this vaccine platform was found to induce both Th1 (IFN-

349

gamma, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10,

350

TGF-beta) upon infection, causing severe infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes into

351

the lung. These pieces of evidence suggest that Th2 is not the sole factor but rather a mixed Th1 and Th2

352

response is responsible for the immunopathology. Additionally, it was found that IL-6 was shown to have

353

a prominent role in SARS-CoV-induced immune enhancement [11] in experimental animals, as well as in

354

lung pathology in SARS patients [37]. The prominent role of IL-6 in host Th17 immune responses suggest

355

that this pathway might also comprise a component of coronavirus vaccine immune enhancement[13].

356

The finding that Th17 lymphocytes activate eosinophils [35], and that eosinophils comprise a key element

357

of Th17 responses is consistent with these findings [35]. Of interest, monoclonal antibodies directed at

358

interfering with IL-6 binding with its receptor are now being investigated as possible immunotherapies

359

for patients with COVID19 [38].

360
361

Finally, in the Alhydrogel® dose-ranging study, we observed that a higher concentration of Alhydrogel ®

362

was required to trigger a fully protective immune response with attenuated eosinophils infiltration, while

363

S protein induced a higher degree of eosinophilic cellular infiltration, which is consistent with the

364

previous finding [12]. Table 1A further summarized the comparison of eosinophilic immunopathology

365

induced by different SARS-CoV vaccines, including the S protein, virus-like particle (VLP) expressing spike

366

protein, and the inactivated whole virus vaccines. The results indicated that the vaccine using VLP

367

expressing S protein triggered worse eosinophilic infiltration than the inactivated whole virus vaccines,

368

and S protein showed the least eosinophil infiltration among them either with or without formulated

369

with alum. Our studies find that the RBD can elicit far less immunopathology than even the S protein.

370

Similar to what was seen for the whole virus vaccine against SARS, lung eosinophil infiltration was

371

observed in mice immunized with MERS gamma irradiation-inactivated whole virus vaccine after

372

challenge with MERS-CoV (Table 1B) [39]. These findings further suggested that Alhydrogel® formulated

373

RBD219-N1 was a safer SARS-CoV vaccine than the ones listed in Table 1A.

374
375

Collectively, all the preclinical data suggested that SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 formulated with alum is a

376

potentially safe and efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV infection. We have developed the scalable

377

process and partnered with WRAIR and manufactured RBD219-N1 protein under current good

378

manufacturing practices (cGMP) in 2016. The bulk drug substance has been frozen (-70°C to -80°C) in a

379

temperature-regulated storage location and under stability testing since its manufacturing date (July

380

2016) and remains stable. This vaccine candidate is ready for formulation and can be rapidly transitioned

381

to clinical testing. The preclinical data reported here suggest that SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 formulated with

382

Alhydrogel®is a safer and more efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV infection compared to many other

383

candidate vaccines. This vaccine is also under evaluation as part of a broader strategy to accelerate as a

384

universal CoV vaccine, possibly in combination with RBDs from other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. RBD to Alhydrogel® binding analysis. (A) A micro BCA assay was used to quantify the % RBD
adsorbed on Alhydrogel® at different RBD to Alhydrogel® (Al) ratios; (B) SDS-PAGE analysis: the
supernatant and pellet fractions for a formulation of 0.2 mg/mL RBD219-N1 with 1.6 mg/mL Alhydrogel
(1:8 ratio) were analyzed. 10 µL of the desorbed RBD from the pellet fraction (P) and 10 µL of supernatant
(S) were loaded on the gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. M: protein marker.
Figure 2. Vaccination-induced protection against lethal MA-15 infection at different stages. Post
immunization: (A) Neutralizing antibody titers after immunization. Post challenge: (B) daily survival rates,
(C) daily weight loss, and the viral loads in the lung on day 1 (D) and day 2 (E).Groups of mice (N=15 per
group) were immunized 3 times with yeast expressed RBDs (20, 10, and 10 µg respectively) or 9 µg of S
protein for each immunization at 3-week intervals. Mice given TBS/alum were included as controls. The
titers of neutralization antibodies were determined on day 50. All vaccinated mice were challenged with
5.6 logs (~ 10X LD50) TCID50/60 µL of MA-15 intranasally (IN). Three challenged mice in each group were
euthanized on days 1 and 2 post-challenge, respectively. The remaining mice in each group (N=9) were
monitored daily for clinical manifestations (e.g., weight loss), and mortality.
Figure 3 Comparison of Alhydrogel (Al) and AddaVax (MF-59-like adjuvant). (A)qPCR for the expression
of the SARS-CoV np gene in the lungs of mice and (B) neutralizing antibody-100 (NT100) titers of mice
differentially vaccinated with RBD219-N1 (log2). The mice (N=4) were vaccinated with RBD219-N1
formulated in Alhydrogel®, AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant), and no adjuvant. On day 52, sera were
collected to evaluate IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. On day 63, mice were i.n. challenged with
SARS-CoV. Each bar represented an individual mice, two mice per group were sacrificed on day 3 and
day 6 posted infection (dpi) to evaluate viral load.

Photomicrographs of lung tissue from Balb/c mice to evaluate eosinophil infiltration after challenge with
SARS-CoV that had previously been immunized with RBD219-N1 formulated with (A) Alhydrogel® (Al), (B)
AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant), and (C) no adjuvant. (A) Alhydrogel® (Al): Perivascular mononuclear
infiltrations (lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages) along with very few eosinophils, only one seen
in this field, indicated by a red arrow. (B) AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant): Severe inflammatory
infiltrations with more than 50% eosinophils, red arrows highlight some of those, and (C) no adjuvant:
Inflammatory infiltrations with less than 50% eosinophils. Scale bar = 100 µm.
Figure 5. Neutralizing (A) and RBD-specific IgG antibody (B) responses of mice immunized with
RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® (Al) at 1:25 or 1:8 ratios. In group 1, a formulation of 0.2 mg/mL RBD in 5
mg/mL Alhydrogel® with the dose of 20 µg/10 µg/10 µg of RBD for prime/1st boost/2nd boost was used
for immunization, respectively. In group 2, the formulation 0.2 mg/mL RBD in 1.6mg/mL Alhydrogel ® was
tested, more specifically, a dosing regimen of 20 µg/10 µg/10 µg RBD for prime/1st boost/2nd boost was
used while in group 3, 10 µg RBD were used for all immunizations. Alhydrogel® alone and pre-formulated
SARS-S protein (3 µg) were used in groups 4 and 5, respectively, as negative and positive controls
