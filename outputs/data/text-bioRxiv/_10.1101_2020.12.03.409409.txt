ABSTRACT
Chemosensitivity assays are commonly used for preclinical drug discovery and clinical trial
optimization. However, data from independent assays are often discordant, largely attributed to
uncharacterized variation in the experimental materials and protocols. Spurred by the annotation of
minimum information (MI) for ensuring data reproducibility, we report here the launching of MICHA
(Minimal Information for Chemosensitivity Assays), accessed via https://micha-protocol.org.
Distinguished from existing MI efforts that are often lack of support from data integration tools,
MICHA can automatically extract publicly available information to facilitate the assay annotation
including: 1) compounds, 2) samples, 3) reagents, and 4) data processing methods. For example,
MICHA provides an integrative web server and database to obtain compound annotation including
chemical structures, targets and disease indications. In addition, the annotation of cell line samples,
assay protocols and literature references can be greatly eased by retrieving manually curated
catalogues. Once the annotation is complete, MICHA can export a report that conforms to the FAIR
principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) of drug screening studies. To
consolidate the utility of MICHA, we provide FAIRified protocols from several major cancer drug
screening studies, as well as recently conducted COVID-19 studies. With the integrative webserver
and database, we envisage a wider adoption of the MICHA strategy to foster a community-driven
effort to improve the open access of drug sensitivity assays.

BACKGROUND
Drug sensitivity or chemo sensitivity assay is an important tool to measure cellular response to drug
perturbation, which has been increasingly used for preclinical drug discovery and clinical trial
optimization. However, poor inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility has been reported when
comparing batches that differ at assay materials and methods1-3. Central to improving the data
reproducibility is the standardization of assay ontologies, with which the research community may
annotate minimal information (MI) about critical components of a typical drug sensitivity experiment.
An existing implementation is MIABE (minimum information about a bioactive entity), which
provides guidelines for the annotation of compound bioactivities4. However, MIABE mainly was
designed for drug-target profiling assays and thus it is not directly applicable for drug sensitivity
assays. Furthermore, like many other similar MI efforts in omics assays, MIABE provided limited
data integration tools to enable its implementation coherently.
The solution we present here, MICHA (minimal information for chemosensitivity assays), provides
an integrative pipeline to facilitate the annotation of four major components of a drug sensitivity
assay, including 1) compounds tested, 2) samples, 3) reagents, and 4) data processing references.
Using the platform of MICHA, we aim to increase acceptance and adoption of the principles of FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), by making the assay annotation as smoothly as
possible with the help of data integration tools and databases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Work flow
Using MICHA, users can upload their chemicals, samples and experimental design information
(Figure 1). To start, users need to upload the names and InChiKeys of the compound, after which
MICHA will automatically extract primary and secondary target information, physio-chemical
properties and disease indications for these compounds. Users may continue filling in the other
experimental details, such as sample (cell lines or patient-derived organoids) information and assay
conditions. For cell lines, only the names of the cell lines are required, as the other information will
be retrieved automatically from internal databases. For annotating assay conditions, we derived a
consensus on the minimal information that is needed, including assay format, detection technology,
end point mode of action, experimental medium, plate type, cell density, time for treatment, dilution
fold, vehicle of compound, dispensation method and volume per well. The definition of these

terminologies are explained in Supplementary File 1 as well as in the ‘Glossary’ tab at the MICHA
website. Furthermore, users are directed to a web form to report data processing information,
including minimum and maximum concentrations of the compounds, publication references and drug
response metric names such as IC50 or AUC. Finally, a tabular report can be generated according to
the user’s input combined with the augmented annotation from public resources. In addition, users
may browse annotated protocols including major cancer and COVID-19 drug screening studies.

Figure 1: User interface and work flow of MICHA. Users start with compound annotation by
uploading a list of compounds with names and InChiKeys, and obtain the compound
pharmacological and physio-chemical properties via an integrative webserver and database. Users
may continue to annotate reagents/samples, experiments and data processing methods, and
generate a report to include all the information in a tabular format. MICHA also harbors the
annotated drug sensitivity screening protocols for cancer and COVID-19.
Data integration tools
Three types of datasets are retrievable via data integration tools in MICHA:
1) Drug-target data
Compound target profiles were integrated from the most comprehensive drug target databases
including DTC5,6, BindingDB7, ChEMBL8, GtopDB9, DGiDB10 and DrugBank11. The first
four databases (DTC, BindingDB, ChEMBL and GtopDB) contain quantitative bioactivity
data whereas DGiDB and DrugBank contains unary drug target information. We focused on
the primary and secondary targets of a compound, defined as those displaying binding
affinities <= 1000 nM from the bioactivity databases, or those that are recorded in unary

databases. We integrated drug targets for 277K chemicals from DTC, 513K from ChEMBL,
258K from Binding DB, 4.8K from GtopDB, 7.6K from DGiDB and 6.8K from DrugBank.
Furthermore, we merged overlapping targets across these databases in order to avoid
duplications, resulting in high-quality target profiles for >800K chemicals. Such a data
integration provided one of the most comprehensive compounds collection along with their
potent primary and secondary targets. All the drug-target information can be retrieved by the
MICHA annotation pipeline or programmatically using the API (application programming
interface).
2) Compound properties, cell line and assay information
Compound physiochemical properties and structures for 1.9 million compounds were
obtained from the ChEMBL database. Furthermore, we integrated disease indications and
clinical phase information for 3600 drugs from the DTC database. This information together
with the drug-target profiles will be retrieved for user-uploaded compound list. When users
annotate the cell lines, the majority of cell line information can be retrieved automatically
from Cellosaurus, which is a comprehensive knowledge database on cell lines12. For assay
annotation, commonly used techniques will be provided for users to choose from to ease the
burden of manual editing.
3) FAIRified protocols
A prime objective for MICHA is to provide a pipeline for the FAIRification of drug sensitivity
assays, such that these established protocols can be well documented with enhanced visibility
to the research community. To initiate such an effort, we have FAIRified drug screening
protocols from major cancer studies including GDSC (345 compounds and 987 cell lines)13,
CCLE (24 compounds and 504 cell lines)14 and CTRPv2 (203 compounds and 242 cell lines)
15.

Furthermore, we have provided drug sensitivity screening protocols extracted from six

recent COVID-19 antiviral studies (5,525 compounds and 2 cell lines) 16-21. On the other hand,
we have provided an example of protocols adopted at the institution level (528 compounds
and 4 cell lines utilized at the high throughput drug-screening unit at the Institute for
Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki). These FAIRified protocols can be
freely obtained at http://micha-protocol.org/protocols/. With more protocols annotated via
MICHA, the research community shall be better informed on the variations on the
experimental condition across different studies and institutions.

MICHA has integrated various databases, which harbor drug-target data at different levels, ranging
from quantitative bioactivity values to unary drug target hits. For instance, DrugBank, GtopDB and
DGiDB are mainly focused on approved compounds with putative target information, while
ChEMBL, BindingDB and DTC are inclusive of bioactivity values for more versatile investigational
and pre-clinical chemicals. In MICHA, we have tried to improve target coverage across the druggable
genome by integrating non-overlapping data points from the latest releases of these databases. As
shown in Figure 2, the average number of targets for 2993 approved drugs in MICHA is 7.33, as
compared to that from ChEMBL (5.5), DGiDB (4.71), DrugBank (3.56), BindingDB (2.74) and
GtopDB (0.96). Similarly, for 1992 investigational compounds (defined as those in clinical trials),
the average number of targets per chemical is higher in MICHA as compared to other databases. The
improved target coverage in MICHA shall open up new applications for drug discovery researchers
for training their drug-target prediction models 22, 23 as well as providing more insights on the mode
of actions.

FAIRification of drug sensitivity screening protocols
We have already FAIRified three major cancer drug screening protocols including CCLE, GDSC and
CTRPv2. These studies share similar objectives of linking genetic features of cancer cell lines to
small-molecule sensitivity to accelerate drug discovery. Table 1 shows a comparison of the major
components in the protocols.

Both GDSC and CTRPv2 used common experimental plate type i.e. 384 wells; whereas CCLE data
was tested on 1536 well plates. In GDSC, two different experimental mediums including DMEM and
RPMI were tested for the 987 cancer cell lines, whereas the CTRPv2 cell lines were tested for many
more different mediums as listed in Table 1. In contrast, we could not find experimental medium
information for CCLE. On the other hand, both CCLE and CTRPv2 have used Cell-Titer-Glo
(Promega), a luminescence-based assay to measure levels of ATP as a surrogate method to cell
viability, whereas GDSC has used based nucleic acid staining syto60 (Invitrogen) for adherent cells
and resazurin (Sigma) for suspension cells. Treatment time is standardized using hours and all the
three screening studies have used at least 72 hours of treatment, after which the IC50 or EC50
concentrations were determined from the dose response curves.

Figure 3 shows the overlapping chemicals and cell lines tested across CCLE, GDSC and CTRPv2
studies, after excluding those chemicals for which proper chemical names or identifiers were missing
in order to preserve high quality data in MICHA. Only two chemicals are shared across the three
studies including selumetinib and tanespimycin (Figure 3A). Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a MEK
(kinase) inhibitor used for treating neurofibromatosis type I in children24; where as tanespimycin is a
Hsp90 inhibitor25 which has been studied for the treatment of leukemia or solid tumors, especially
kidney tumors. In contrast, more overlap was found for the cell lines, with 112 cell lines in common
across the three studies (Figure 3B).

MICHA has not only FAIRified cancer related drug screening studies but also annotated six recent
studies on COVID-19, a virus that causes ongoing pandemic with limited drug treatment options.
From these studies, we have identified 5,318 chemicals tested across two cell lines including Vero
E6 and Caco-2. The annotations of these compounds, cell lines, as well as the experimental
information and data analysis methods can be easily retrieved at http://micha-protocol.org/covid19.
With the help of MICHA platform, all these COVID-19 and cancer related drug screening protocols
are freely accessible to the users (Findable). Moreover, these protocols can be accessed
programmatically using MICHA API available at: http://micha-protocol.org/api (Accessible). In
silico models can programmatically access MICHA to obtain compound information such as protein
targets and physiochemical properties and use this information for novel drug target predictions
(Interoperable). MICHA drug screening protocols as defined in aforementioned sections can be used
as a reference for the experimental design of future drug screening studies, as well as serve as a source
of information to evaluate the data reproducibility (Reusable). Moreover, the MICHA source code is
available at GitHub for reuse of the application towards a tailoring need for individual drug screening
centers (https://github.com/JehadAldahdooh/MICHA).

Chemosensitivity assay screening has been increasingly utilized for preclinical drug discovery and
clinical trial optimization. However, chemosensitivity assays often lack sufficient annotation to make
the data FAIR, which has become a limiting factor for supporting its clinical translation. To improve
the assay annotation, web portals that facilitate information retrieval from different assay components
are critically needed. To address this issue, we have recently launched MICHA (Minimal information
for Chemosensitivity assays) as a web server for the annotation of chemosensitivity screens that
covers critical information including 1) compounds 2) samples 3) reagent protocols and finally, 4)
data processing methods.
Comprehensive drug-target profiles were deposited to the MICHA database for more than 800K
compounds. These high-quality pharmacological data shall help improve the understanding on the
mode of actions not only for approved drugs but also for investigational and preclinical compounds.
Furthermore, the target profiles at the druggable genome scale provide more information on the
polypharmacological effects, which might lead to new opportunities for drug repositioning26. To
facilitate the data retrieval, the API in MICHA is highly optimized such that it can return target
profiles for thousands of chemicals within seconds.
With the MICHA web portal, we have FAIRified major drug sensitivity screening protocols from
five cancer studies and six recent COVID-19 studies, serving as the first instances of the catalogue.
Comparing these manually curated assay protocols should allow a more systematic analysis of data
reproducibility. With the FAIR-compliant data resources and tools to deliver content standards and
ontology services, MICHA will ensure the characterization of critical assay components, allow the
FAIRification and cataloguing of drug sensitivity studies, and support the downstream analysis
towards clinical translation. We invite the drug discovery community to use MICHA for annotating
their drug sensitivity assays to improve the knowledge sharing, which shall ultimately lead to a bigger
impact in translational medicine.
