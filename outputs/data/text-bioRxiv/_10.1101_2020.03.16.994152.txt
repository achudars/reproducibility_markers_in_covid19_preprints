Abstract

24

Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the emerging severe

25

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which there are no

26

efficacious vaccines or therapeutics that are urgently needed. We expressed three

27

versions of spike (S) proteins—receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S

28

ectodomain—in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S

29

associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer

30

excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron

31

microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a

32

unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of

33

coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 Å proximal to viral

34

membrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-

35

CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine

36

development.

Introduction

41

The novel coronavirus grouped in betacoronavirus genus has become the third serious

42

virus intruder to human in the coronaviridae, after sever acute respiratory syndrome

43

coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus

44

(MERS-CoV), recently named SARS-CoV-2. In the phylogenic tree of the

45

coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to some bat coronavirus and SARS-

46

CoV, however, with its origin undefined1. SARS-CoV-2 causative disease

47

"Coronavirus disease 2019" (abbreviated "COVID-19") is characterized by high fever,

48

dry cough, difficulty breathing and sever atypical pneumonia, which usually be

49

confirmed by virus RNA positive or pulmonary computed tomography (CT) in clinical

50

practice2, 3. In terms of higher human-to-human transmissibility, SARS-CoV-2 has

51

spread over 118 countries and areas, and led to over 125,288 confirmed cases

52

worldwide and at least 4,614 deaths, as of March 12th 2020. The World Health

53

Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic as a pandemic of

54

international concern and updates the COVID-19 situation every day.

55

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus

56

encapsulated with a genome of ~30 kb. At least three membrane proteins including the

57

surface spike protein (S), an integral membrane protein (M), a membrane protein (E).

58

Like other coronaviruses, S is responsible for initiating the engagement to a specific

59

cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediating the cell-virus

60

membrane fusion by the class I fusion mechanism4, 5. Thus, S is the main target for

61

neutralizing antibodies against viral infection and the core immunogen constituent of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152; this version posted March 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

62

vaccine design. S is consisted of S1 and S2 subunits and the cleavage on S1/S2

63

boundary by protease during biosynthesis is prerequisite for coronaviruses cellular

64

membrane fusion and subsequent infection6. SARS-CoV-2 evolves a 4-residue

65

insertion (RRAR) as potential furin cleavage site rather than SARS-CoV and other bat

66

coronaviruses, which may contribute to the higher transmissibility of this novel

67

coronavirus6, 7. Previous studies suggested the infection process of MERS-CoV8 and

68

SARS9 viruses, where S trimer undergoes conformational transition from a prefusion

69

conformation ready for ACE2 binding to a postfusion conformation for eventual virus-

70

cell membrane fusion. Structure determination of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike

71

trimers captured a variety of scenarios in the prefusion conformation showing partial

72

(one or two) receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the “up” conformation and the rest in

73

the “down”, and all in either “up” or “down”. The conformation transition from “down”

74

to “up” could expose the receptor binding site, and the subsequent receptor engagement

75

would lead to a substantial conformation rearrangement of S trimer from prefusion

76

conformation to postfusion. Two recent studies7, 10 reported cryo-electron microscope

77

(cryo-EM) structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers in the prefusion conformation with

78

2 RBDs down and 1 RBD up. In the case of SARS-CoV, this conformational change

79

during RBDs “down” to “up” was associated with the binding of receptor ACE2 as well

80

as the recognition of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 11.

81

A safe and efficacious vaccine is urgently needed to control and eliminate the

82

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Various forms of vaccine candidates, mostly aiming to elicit

83

neutralizing antibodies against S proteins, are under preclinical research or even

84

subjected to clinical trials12. Here, we cloned S ectodomain and its fragments RBD and

85

S1 into recombinant baculovirus and expressed the proteins in insect cells. We found

86

that S and S1 formed homotrimer in solutions and the three proteins reacted well with

87

COVID-19 convalescent human sera. Cryo-EM analysis demonstrated the S trimer

88

unexpectedly retains a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion

89

conformation of coronavirus spikes, that may represent an early state rather than the

90

known prefusion conformation of S spike. These results might broaden the knowledge

91

on coronavirus virology and provide another protective conformation of S trimer for

92

structure-based vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its causative

93

COVID-19.

Results

96

Construct design, expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins

97

To screen a potent immunogen for COVID-19 vaccine development, we designed three

98

constructs—S ectodomain, S1 and RBD—for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein

99

expression by aligning the SARS-CoV-2 S gene (Genbank accession no. NC_045512.2)

100

to a SARS-CoV strain (Genbank accession no. NC_004718) S gene sequence in terms

101

of structure-defined domain profile of the SARS-CoV S protein (Fig. 1A). The gene of

102

SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain encoding amino acids (aa) 15-1,213 with removal of its

103

original signal sequence was cloned to the downstream of the gp67 signal sequence in

104

pAcgp67B plasmid vector (Fig.1B). and with its C-terminal addition of a thrombin

105

cleavage site, a T4 trimerization foldon motif and his tag. The segments S1 (aa 15-

106

680) and RBD (aa 319-541) were cloned similar to S ectodomain, keeping gp67 signal

107

peptide and his tag to facilitate secretory outside cell and affinity purification,

108

respectively, but without the thrombin site and T4 foldon (Fig. 1A). The three

109

constructed plasmids were respectively co-transfected into Sf9 insect cells with v-

110

cath/chiA gene deficient baculovirus DNA for the generation and amplification of

111

recombinant baculovirus, which were then harnessed to infect Hive Five insect cells to

112

eventually produce recombinant proteins, named S, S1 and RBD respectively.

113

The recombinant proteins were mostly soluble expressed and secreted into the

114

culture medium. The centrifugation supernatants of cell culture went through metal

115

affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin. S, S1 and RBD proteins were mainly

116

eluted in a separation fractions under 250 mM imidazole elution, and resolved as

117

molecular weight (m.w.) of ~180 kDa, 110 kDa and 35 kDa, respectively, in SDS-

118

PAGE as indicated by a corresponding western blotting (WB) using anti-His antibody

119

as detection antibody (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, about one half S proteins were cleaved

120

into S1 (identical migration site to S1 lane in Fig. 1C) and S2 (about 80kDa developed

121

in anti-His WB) possibly by innate furin of insect cell that was also found in other cases

122

of enzymatic cleave while protein expression in insect cell, such as Flu HA

123

eluted S fraction was further polished by Superdex 200 to remove contaminative

124

proteins (Fig. 1D). These peaks fractionated at retention volume 28mL, 36mL, 48mL,

125

and 65mL, were further harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The results

126

indicated that S proteins together with cleaved S1/S2 were resolved at peak 1 in size-

127

exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1D) and showed a high purity of over 95% total

13

. The

128

S/S1/S2 in gel (Fig. 1E). Overall, one-step Ni-NTA affinity chromatography produced

129

RBD with 95% purity and a yield of 30 mg per L cell culture, S1 with about 90% purity

130

and 10 mg per L yield, while further purification through a size-exclusion

131

chromatography (SEC), the resultant S sample had over 95% purity regarding intact S

132

and cleaved S1/S2, and was harvested in a yield of 1 mg per L cell culture. These data

133

set up a start point for further optimization on expression and purification process of

134

SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen candidates through insect baculovirus expression vector

135

system (BEVS).

136
137

Physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, S1 and S proteins

138

We next investigated the physiochemical properties of the recombinant S protein and

139

its fragments purified from insect cells, including association potential, thermal

140

stability

141

chromatography (HPSEC) and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation

142

(SV-AUC) analyses were carried out to measure the oligomerization potential of the

143

three proteins in solution. RBD, S1 and S all showed single major peak in HPSEC

144

profiles at elution volume of 9.0 mL, 5.5 and 5.3 mL, respectively (Fig. 2A and Fig.

145

2B). RBD, S1 and S were further verified by SV-AUC, where RBD sedimented as

146

single species of 3.1S in c(s) profile, corresponding to apparent molecular weight 22

147

kDa (Fig. 2D); S1 existed as a dominant species of 11.3 S (estimated as 277 kDa

148

corresponding to S1 trimer) and a minor aggregate form of 20 S (Fig. 2E); S and cleaved

149

S1/S2 resolved as 15.2 S, equivalent to 577 kDa, approximately as the theoretical

and

glycosylation

situation.

150

molecular weight of intact S trimer. The three proteins were further analyzed by

151

differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that was usually used to investigate the inner

152

thermostability of macromolecules or their complexes14. RBD and S1 showed one

153

major peak at comparable thermal denaturation midpoints (Tm) of 46.0 °C and 45.5 °C,

154

respectively (Fig. 3G and 3H), whereas S sample showed two major peaks at Tm of

155

45.5°C (identical to Tm of S1) and 64.5°C (Fig. 3I), which might reflect the coexistence

156

of intact S and cleaved S1/S2.

157

On the other hand, we investigated the glycosylation extent of the three protein by

158

enzymatic deglycosylation analysis. Endo H could unleash the chithobiose core of high

159

mannose and some hybrid oligosaccharides from N-liked glycoproteins, therefore

160

remove the extended branches of glycans and leave the one N acetylglucosamine

161

(GlcNAc) on N-linked glycoproteins. While PNGase F would release N-linked glycan

162

moieties between GlcNAc and ASN residues within a glycoprotein. It should be noted

163

that glycosylation in insect cells is featured as terminal mannose glycans, unlike

164

complex sialylated glycans in mammalian cells, and glycosylation is known to correlate

165

the immunogenicity and broad-coverage protection of a glycoprotein immunogen15, 16.

166

After the treatment of either Endo H or PNGase F, RBD showed no discernible decrease

167

of molecular weight in SDS-PAGE/anti-His WB, S1 and S2 both demonstrated nearly

168

~10 kDa decrease, and the intact S exhibited substantial shrinkage in molecular weight

169

of about ~20 kDa decrease (Fig. 2J). The analyses conclude that the glycosylation

170

extent within S glycoprotein is RBD < S1 ~ S2, consistent to the predicted glycosylation

171

profile of S polypeptide (Fig. 1A).

173

Reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1 and S proteins against convalescent COVID-

174

19 human sera

175

We next evaluated the antigenicity of the three versions of S proteins by WB and ELISA

176

using a panel of six COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which was collected from

177

COVID-19 patients after they recovered from the disease in the First Affiliated Hospital

178

of Xiamen University. Eight reducing SDS gel duplicates of the one depicted in Fig.

179

1C were prepared for WB analysis using these six convalescent sera and two control

180

sera from health human (Fig. 3A-3H, left panel). As expected, intact S protein bands

181

reacted well with all the six convalescent sera (Fig. 3A-3H, left panel). Unexpectedly,

182

five of six sera showed no or very weak reactivities against RBD, only Serum #6

183

possessed RBD's activity. Among the five sera with lower RBD-reactivity, Serum #2,

184

#3 and #5 well recognized S1 and the cleaved S1 in lane S, suggesting these sera may

185

specifically react with NTD of S1. S2 demonstrated reaction activity against all the six

186

sera, like the intact S. No detectable reaction was observed in the control sera (Fig. 3G

187

and 3H). Inconsistent to the WB results, RBD, S1 and S shared comparable reactivities

188

against the convalescent sera in ELISA, although the sera per se presented varied

189

reaction titers (represented as ET50) following the reaction sequence: Serum #5 > #2 >

190

#3> #1 > # 6 > #4 (Fig. 3A-3H, right panel).

191

Taken together, RBD, S1 and S proteins from insect cells maintain the native-like

192

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. These epitopes in native virion should be immunogenic in

193

COVID-19 patients and capable of eliciting high antibody titer in the convalescent

194

phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these epitopes, most RBD epitopes are strictly

195

tertiary conformation-dependent sites that are damaged upon the mild denatured

196

condition of reductant and SDS treatment, NTD within S1 bears some linear epitopes,

197

whereas S2 part essentially has linear epitopes that are immunogenic in all COVID-19

198

patients (n=6).

199
200

Cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins

201

To examine the structure of the trimeric S ectodomain with native sequence, we

202

prepared cryo-EM grids using the Ni-NTA purified S proteins and collected 1,513

203

electron micrograph movies. Most of motion-corrected micrographs demonstrated

204

plenty of well-dispersed particles with an approximate size as the canonical coronavirus

205

S trimer (Fig. 4A). A total of 162,645 particles were picked out for multiple rounds of

206

2D classification, consequently, 37,147 particles grouped into top 10 classes, rendering

207

typical feature of S trimer in prefusion conformation as recently reported7, 10, were

208

selected for further analysis (Fig. 4B). 3D reconstruction (applying 3-fold symmetry)

209

yielded the density map of prefusion spike (S-pre) at resolution of 5.43 Å (Fig. 3D and

210

Supplementary Fig. 1A).

211

Structurally, three S monomers intertwine around each other and associate to

212

homotrimers with 145 Å height seen from side-view and 160 Å diameter in top-view

213

(Fig. 4C and 4D). We then recruited the recently reported cryo-EM map of S prefusion

214

trimer (EMD-21374, at resolution of 3.17 Å, low pass to 5.43 Å prior to structural

215

comparison) and compared our cryo-EM map at same resolution (Fig. 4D). It was

216

worthy noted that the compared prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was engineered with

217

site-directed mutations to stabilize prefusion conformation and expressed in 239F cells.

218

The mutant included two stabilizing proline mutations at residues 986, 987 and a

219

“GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site7. Surprisingly, the alignment

220

demonstrated that the two cryo-EM structures share similar mushroom-shaped

221

architecture in particular nearly identical at stalk moiety (S2 region), but our S-pre

222

shows the cap part (S1 region) at ~15Å lower position than the reported S trimer in

223

RBD-down prefusion conformation (Fig. 4D). Regarding to substantial mismatch at the

224

density of 3 S1 subunits, we respectively fitted 5 individual domains (NTD, RBD, SD1,

225

SD2 and S2) of the SARS-CoV-2 S structure (PDB code 6VSB) to our S-pre map. In

226

the fitting map, NTD, RBD, SD2 and S2 could be well placed in the S-pre map,

227

especially for the latter two, which reflects the aforementioned good match at the stalk

228

of the mushroom-shape (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, there is no observable

229

density between RBD and SD2 to accommodate an SD1 model (Supplementary Fig. 2),

230

which suggests SD1 region is dramatically flexible in our S-pre structure (Fig. 4E and

231

4F). When the combined model of fitted NTD-RBD-SD2-S2 was superimposed to the

232

original S protomer structure (PDB code 6VSB, Chain A, RBD in down conformation),

233

both NTD and RBD in the original S obviously move and rotate up against our

234

combined model (Fig. 4G). The structural comparison demonstrated that the S-pre

235

trimer retains a unique conformation different from the prefusion conformation of the

236

two reported SARS-CoV-2 spike structures (PDB codes 6VSB and 6VXX).

237

We then compared the conformation of our S-pre structure with that of 21

238

deposited coronavirus S models. Six representative S structures7, 17-20 from four known

239

genus (α-, β-, γ- and δ-genus) in coronaviridae are respectively fitted to the S-pre map

240

(Supplementary Fig. 3). Five S trimer structures of other coronaviruses share similar

241

prefusion conformation with the reported SARS-CoV-2 S structure but substantially

242

distinct with the unique conformation of our S-pre.

243

Apart from most particles classified as S-pre in our sample, 2D classifications also

244

showed five classes of few particles (2,951) assuming an elongated rosette-shape

245

assembly. These particles were further reconstructed and yielded a structure at lower

246

resolution of 8.40 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1B) that could be considered as post-fusion

247

spike (S-post), as the structure has similar shape but shorter length (~170 Å) as

248

compared to the postfusion spike of SARS-CoV21 and the presumed one observed in

249

native SARS-CoV-2 virion (BioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.972927)

250

(Supplementary Fig. 4) . Fitting the S-post map with the core region structure of SAR-

251

CoV-2 S2 subunit in post-fusion conformation (PDB code 6LXT) indicated that our S-

252

post exhibits roughly rod shape similar with the post-fusion structure (Supplementary

253

Fig. 4).

Conformational transition of SARS-CoV-2 spike from early prefusion to

Briefly, we’ve obtained two conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike from insect cells.

The dominant one maintains the similar mushroom-shaped trimer as the previous

259

models, while the S1 region substantially diverges. The other conformation essentially

260

resembles the postfusion state. However, we could not find the classic prefusion

261

conformation in our sample. We next tried to figure out at which stage the unique

262

conformation occurs during the spike conformation change. The space relationship of

263

NTD or RBD to S2 domain in the unique, RBD-down and RBD-up prefusion

264

conformations (Fig. 5A) was measured by a reference plant approximately parallel to

265

the viral membrane. The plane is defined by the positions of three equivalent Cα atoms

266

(residue 694 be used) from three S2 subunits of the trimer structures. Numerical data

267

shows that (1) the NTD and RBD in the unique conformation retain the lowest position

268

in the three prefusion conformations; (2) the NTD and RBD of RBD-down prefusion

269

stretch upward 16.6° rotation/16 Å elevation, and 13.1°/18 Å, respectively, with respect

270

to the unique conformation; (3) from RBD-down to RBD-up prefusion state, the RBD

271

elevates 9 Å with an additional rotation whereas the NTD remaining nearly stationary

272

(Supplementary Movie S1). The resultant “up” RBD is ready for ACE2 binding and

273

the spike eventually is rearranged to postfusion state upon RBD-ACE2 interaction11, 22

274

(Fig. 5B). The motion trend of NTD and RBD from prefusion to postfusion state in

275

conformational transition is away from the viral membrane, suggesting the unique

276

conformation may occur earlier than RBD-down prefusion conformation, named as

277

“early prefusion conformation” (Fig. 5). This early prefusion conformation might exist

278

in other coronaviruses as well.

Discussion

282

SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the species barrier and sweep over the planet by person-to-

283

person transmission in an R0 ~2.56 rate23, first wave in China and the second wave

284

booming outside China. WHO has declared the event as another pandemic infectious

285

disease in human history, and the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still in

286

data accumulation. Although the biology and virology of SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive,

287

in terms of knowledge on other coronaviruses, the spikes decorating the SARS-CoV-2

288

virion play a critical role in viral attachment and entry to host cells. Cryo-EM structures

289

of spikes in the prefusion conformation, and RBD-bound receptor ACE2 have indicated

290

the engagement of SARS-CoV-2 to cellular membrane requires a serial of

291

conformational change of RBDs. The change is presumed from the start point of 3

292

RBDs down in the prefusion conformation, then RBD(s) up for ACE2 binding, and

293

eventually spike is rearranged to postfusion. In this study, we suggest that the SARS-

294

CoV-2 spike may retain at more precedent state than the classic prefusion conformation

295

that has been determined for other coronaviruses. This early prefusion conformation

296

features that the cap of the mushroom-shaped spike constituted by three S1 subunits is

297

more proximal to viral membrane by 15 Å than in the classic prefusion conformation.

298

The SARS-CoV-2 spike expressed in insect cells predominantly retains a unique

299

early prefusion conformation, which was repeatable in at least three batches of samples

300

and is ascribed to two possible reasons – native aa sequence used in the S ectodomain

301

construct and over-expression in insect cells. There is about a half of S proteins

302

undergoing cleavage on the S1/S2 boundary site in the purified samples both after the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152; this version posted March 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

303

first Ni-NAT and the second SEC purification (Fig. 1C and 1E). Further analyses

304

suggest the split between S1 and S2 likely takes no effect on the trimerization of S

305

trimer. It is known that the insect cells can confer post-translation glycosylation for

306

protein over-expression as mammalian cells despite the latter can produce more

307

complex sialyation24, and thus provide an alternative way to generate glycoprotein in

308

native conformation. Our results indicate that RBD, NTD and S2 domains of SARS-

309

CoV-2 demonstrated different glycosylation extent in insect cells, however, RBD, S1

310

and S proteins comparably react well with six convalescent COVID-19 human sera

311

albeit they differ in domain composition, polypeptide length and oligomerization.

312

There are numbers of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, including inactivated,

313

vectored, recombinant and nucleotide vaccine forms, under preclinical research.

314

Various versions of S proteins are the major targets for vaccine immunogen candidate.

315

In addition to potent neutralizing antibody elicitation upon immunization, potential

316

antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) is the major concern for an efficacious

317

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. ADE has been found in the development of numbers of virus

318

vaccine candidates, including respiratory syndrome virus (RSV), dengue fever

319

human immunodeficient virus (HIV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV

320

believed that ADE is associated with non-neutralization epitope attribute and / or

321

specific antibody isotype28, 29, in which virus-bound antibody would promote the viral

322

infection to immune cells through Fc fragment targeting γFc receptors on the cellular

323

surface and enhance the disease severity. Therefore, the strategy of vaccine design

324

against SARS-CoV-2 should include the consideration of antigen region selection,

25-27

25, 26

,

and so on. It is

325

glycosylation number/extent and exactly presented prefusion conformation. The

326

prefusion conformation needed to be maintained is exemplified by the case of RSV

327

vaccine candidate in which F trimer in prefusion is much potent than postfusion30-32.

328

Hence the early prefusion conformation proposed for SARS-CoV-2 spike should be

329

drawn an attention for immunogen design as well as the prefusion one.

330

In conclusion, we obtain three kinds of S proteins showing excellent antigenicity

331

and find an early prefusion conformation for SARS-CoV-2 spike. Nevertheless, the

332

molecular level detail for such conformation and the underlying immunogenicity

333

should be further investigated, and whether this conformation recapitulates the exact

334

state of spike in native SARS-CoV-2 virion remains to be determined.

Materials and Methods

337

Cloning, protein expression and purification

338

The SARS-CoV-2 S gene (Genbank accession no. NC_045512.2) was synthesized and

339

cloned into a baculovirus shuttle vector pAcgp67B (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) using

340

Gibson assembly. The S construct encoding aa 15-1,213 (numbered as original

341

sequence), contains a thrombin site, a T4 foldon domain to assist in trimerization and a

342

C-terminal 10-His tag for purification. For S1 construct contains gene encoding aa 15-

343

680 followed by a 10-His tag. The RBD construct (aa 319-541) also contains 10-his tag

344

to facilitate purification. In all three constructs, the natural signal peptide (aa 1-14

345

analyzed by SignalP tool) was replaced with a gp67 secretion signal peptide at N-

346

terminus.

347

The expression and purification of proteins were performed as described

348

previously33. All plasmids were co-transfected with linearized 2.0 DNA (deficient in v-

349

cath/chiAgenes) (Expression Systems, CA, USA) into Sf9 insect cells (Thermo Fisher

350

Scientific, MA, USA), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer

351

(Expression Systems). The transfection supernatant was harvested and amplified 2

352

times to obtain a high titer of the recombinant viruses. Hive Five cells (BTI-TN-5B1-

353

4) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems)

354

and infected with recombinant virus at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 in the

355

exponential growth phase (2× 106 cells/ml, 95% viability) at 28°C for 72 h. The culture

356

media was centrifugated at 8,000 rpm for 20 min. Then the supernatant was dialyzed

357

against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and purified with Ni-sepharose fast

358

flow 6 resin (GE Healthcare, Boston, USA) by the elution with 250 mM imidazole. The

359

protein concentrations of the final purified samples were measured with Pierce™BCA

360

Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

361
362

SDS-PAGE and western blot

363

Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer and boiled for 10 min, and subjected

364

to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Equal

365

amounts of proteins for each sample were loaded onto two SDS-PAGE gels, one for

366

western blotting and one for Coomassie staining. The proteins were electrophoresed for

367

70 min at 80 V in a BioRad MINI-PROTEAN Tetra system (BioRad Laboratories, CA,

368

USA), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) for 30

369

min at room temperature. For western blotting, separated proteins were transferred onto

370

a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) using a Trans-Blot Turbo

371

transfer system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked and then incubated for 1 h with

372

an His-tag-specific mouse mAb antibody (Proteintech, Rosemont, USA) or human sera

373

(1:500 dilution). Unbound antibody was removed by five 5-min washes and the

374

membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse

375

secondary antibody or goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,

376

UK). Membranes were washed again and then developed using SuperSignal ELISA

377

Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

378
379

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

380

Purified proteins were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates at 100 ng/well in PBS at

381

37°C for 4 h. The background was blocked with 1 × Enzyme dilution buffer (PBS +

382

0.25% casein + 1% gelatin + 0.05% proclin-300) at 37°C for 2 h. Sera were diluted

383

started at 1:100 followed with three-fold serially dilution, and added to the wells (100 µl)

384

and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse anti-

385

human antibody (Abcam) was used as secondary antibody at 1:5,000 for 30 min. Wells

386

were washed again and the reaction catalyzed using o-phenylenediamine (OPD)

387

substrate at 37°C for 10 min. The OD450nm (reference, OD620nm) was measured on

388

a microplate reader (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland), with a cut-off value 0.1. The

389

Half effective titers (ET50) was calculated by sigmoid trend fitting using GraphPad

390

Prism software.

Size-Exclusive Chromatography (SEC)

392

Ni-NTA purified S proteins were further loaded into Superdex200 (GE Healthcare), the

393

fractions were harvested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All high-purity RBD, S1 and S

394

proteins were subjected to HPLC (Waters; Milford, MA) analysis using a TSK Gel

395

G5000PWXL7.8 × 300 mm column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated in PBS, pH

Analytical Ultracentrifuge (AUC)

400

The AUC assay was performed using a Beckman XL-Analytical ultracentrifuge

401

(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), as described elsewhere34. The sedimentation

402

velocity (SV) was carried out at 20°C with diluted proteins in PBS. The AN-60 Ti rotor

403

speed was set to 20,000-30,000 rpm according to the molecular weight of the control

404

proteins. Data was collected using SEDFIT computer software, kindly provided by Dr.

405

P. C. Shuck (NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA). Multiple curves were fit to calculate the

406

sedimentation coefficient (S) using continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution

407

model [c(s)], and then the c(s) used to estimate protein molar mass.
