Abstract
Nucleic acid detection techniques are always critical to diagnosis, especially in the background of the
present COVID-19 pandemic. The simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and
specificity are always urgently needed. However, the current nucleic acid detection techniques are still
limited the traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome the limitation, we here develop a
CRISPR/Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, DNA sample is incubated with a pair of
capture sgRNAs (sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe,
and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature for 15 min. During this
incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture
sequence of sgRNAa and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb.
Finally the detection result is reported by a fluorescent or colorimetric signal readout. This detection was
verified by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cell and virus. Especially, by designing a set of sgRNAs
specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples
were successfully detected by the method. All detections can be finished in 30 minutes at room
temperature. This detection holds promise for rapid on-the-spot detection or point-of-care testing (POCT).

1. Introduction
Nucleic acid detection is essential to agriculture, food industry and medicine. Therefore, development of
nucleic acid detection techniques always attracts intensive attentions in these fields, which promotes the
sustainable technique development. In mechanism, three types of DNA detection techniques are widely
used. The first is the DNA amplification mainly based on various polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
including traditional PCR (tPCR)(1), quantitative PCR (qPCR)(2) and digital PCR (3). DNA amplification
also includes various isothermal amplifications (4,5), such as rolling circle amplification (RCA),
recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop-mediated Isothermal amplification technology
(LAMP), nucleic acid sequence-dependent amplification (NASBA), and nicking enzyme amplification
reaction (NEAR). The second is nucleic acid hybridization including traditional Southern and Northern
blotting, and DNA microarrays or chips. The third is DNA sequencing including traditional Sanger
sequencing, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and nanopore sequencing. Each technique has its
advantages and still plays important role in various nucleic acid tests. Nevertheless, in application to the
increasingly demanded on spot test or point-of-care diagnosis (POCT), these techniques are now
challenged by their intrinsic limitations. Especially, the time-consuming and instrument-dependent
processes of enzymatic or hybridization reaction make these techniques difficult to be the simple, rapid and
portable diagnostic tools. Moreover, these techniques are still challenged by the unsatisfied sensitivity or
specificity resulted from enzyme-introduced mutations and mismatched hybridization. Fortunately, the
advent of Clusters of regularly spaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPR) provides new chance to change
the situation (6,7).
CRISPR was first discovered in bacteria genome as an immunity weapon to phages (8). Immediately its
worth as a new type of gene editing tool was rapidly mined (9,10). Especially, Cas9 of type II CRISPR
system was intensively explored due to its benefit requiring only one CRISPR-associated nuclease. This
single CRISPR protein can function as sequence-specific DNA endonuclease by associating with
CRISPR-related RNA (crRNA) and trans-activated crRNA (tracrRNA), in which tracrRNA can activate
Cas9 nuclease and crRNA guide Cas9 to target DNA. TracrRNA and crRNA can be ligated into a single
guide RNA (sgRNA)(11), greatly simplifying the application of CRISPR/Cas9 system. This system is then
widely used to edit, regulate and target genomes (12). Due to the high specificity of interaction with its
targets, Cas9 has also been gradually used to develop new DNA detection methods. For example, the
CRISPR/Cas9 system has been early used to detect Zika viruses and can type Zika viruses (13). Recently,
several DNA detection methods were developed by using its typical double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
cleavage activity of Cas9, such as CRISPR-typing PCR (ctPCR)(14-16), CUT-LAMP (17), FLASH(18),
and . Several DNA detection methods were developed by using the Cas9 nickase activity, such as
Cas9nAR (Cas9 nickase-based amplification reaction) (19), and CRISDA (CRISPR-Cas9-triggered
nicking endonuclease-mediated Strand Displacement Amplification) (20). In addition, several DNA
detection methods were developed by using the catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9), such as
CRISPR-Chip (21) and paired dCas9 proteins linked to split halves of luciferase (22). However, the
potential of Cas9/sgRNA system in nucleic acid detection and typing has not yet been fully explored by the
current studies.
In contrast to CRISPR/Cas9, other CRISPR/Cas proteins with collateral cleavage activity attracted
increasing attention and have been intensively explored in recent years (23). Firstly, Cas13a (also called
C2c2) of type III CRISPR system was used to develop SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic
Reporter UnLOCKing) by using its target-cutting activated collateral cleavage activity for single-stranded
RNA (ssRNA) (24-27). Then Cas12a (also known as Cpf1) (28) and Cas14 (also known as Cas12f) (29)
3

with collateral cleavage activity of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was used to develop DETECTR (DNA
Endonuclease Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) (28,29) and HOLMES (a one-HOur Low-cost
Multipurpose highly Efficient System) (30,31). Immediately, the HOLMESv2 (HOLMES2.0) and
CDetection technology were developed by using the collateral cleavage activity to single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) of Cas12b (also known as C2c1) (32,33). These methods are demonstrated to have attomolar
sensitivity and single-base specificity. The ultrahigh sensitivity of these methods partially rely on the signal
amplification resulted from collateral cleavage activity of related Cas enzymes. These methods are
therefore used to detect various pathogenic viruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) (24,25), dengue virus
(DENV) (24), human papillomavirus (HPV) (28), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)(32), African swine
fever virus s (ASFV) (34), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)(35). Recently, these techniques are
striving to detect SARS-CoV-2 (36-41). However, these CRISPR Cas-based detection methods typically
require DNA pre-amplification with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (31), reverse transcription-RPA
(RT-RPA)(25), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) (25,27,28,34,35), Loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) (32,39), reverse transcription-LAMP (RT-LAMP) (32,39), and asymmetric PCR
(32). These pre-amplifications also partially contribute to the ultrahigh sensitivity of these methods.
Additionally, SHERLOCK also needs reverse transcription and T7 in vitro transcription when detecting
RNA (27). Such amplification dependence still makes these methods difficult to become simple, rapid and
portable diagnostic tools.
In this study, we develop a new DNA detection method based on CRISPR/Cas9 named as
CRISPR/Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this method, a pair of capture sgRNAs (sgRNAa and
sgRNAb) are designed for a target DNA. SgRNAa and sgRNAb harbor a different 3â€² terminal capture
sequence. When target DNA is bound by a pair of dCas9-sgRNA complexes, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA
complex will be captured on surface of beads or microplate via annealing between an oligonucleotide
coupled on solid supports and capture sequence of sgRNAa. Then the captured dCas9-sgRNA-DNA
complex is reported by a kind of signal reporter captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. This method
was validated by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cell and virus. Especially, by designed a set of sgRNAs
specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), this study successfully detected 64 clinical
cervical samples with this method. Of importance, a target DNA can be rapidly detected in less than 30
minutes using a signal readout of fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR). This method has its
unique advantages over the current methods such as free of enzyme, pre-amplification, modular heaters,
simplicity and rapidness.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of sgRNA
SgRNA was designed with online sgRNA design software Chop-Chop (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/), using
hg19 as the reference genome. The designed sgRNAs are shown in Table S1. Each DNA target had a pair
of sgRNA, named sgRNAa and sgRNAb, respectively. According to the designed sgRNA, primers (Table
S2) were synthesized to amplify sgRNA template by PCR using our previous protocol (42). The
PCR-amplified sgRNA template has a T7 promoter sequence. SgRNA was then prepared by in vitro
transcription using sgRNA template as previously described (42). The prepared sgRNA had a 5 â€²-end 20 bp
target DNA-specific sequence and a 3 â€²-end capture sequence. SgRNAa had a 3 â€²-end capture sequence
named as Capture 1 that was used to anneal with the capture oligonucleotide immobilized on the surface of
the magnetic beads or microplate. SgRNAb had a 3â€²-end capture sequence named as Capture 2 that was
used to anneal with a signal reporter-associated oligonucleotide.

Î¼

preparing HCR hairpins, 30 Î¼L of FAM-hairpin-1 and FAM-hairpin-2 were mixed. The mixture was
incubated at 95 Â°C for 5 min and then naturally cooled to room temperature (RT). The HCR hairpins
(Hairpin 1 and Hairpin 2) were kept at 4 Â°C. In order to evaluate HCR hairpins and sgRNA, liquid-phase
HCR reactions were performed. Each reaction (20 Î¼L) contained 1Ã— Binding buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 M
NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), 0.2 Î¼M Hairpin 1, 0.2 Î¼M Hairpin 2, and 30
nM Initiator (Table S3) or sgRNA. The reaction was kept at RT for 20 min and detected by agarose gel
electrophoresis.
2.4. Preparation of Beads@oligo
A biotin-modified oligo RE-flanking (Table S3) was synthesized and dissolved in TE buffer at a
concentration of 100 Î¼M. In order to prepare DNA-coupled Beads (Beads@oligo), 1 Î¼L of the magnetic
beads (Dynabeadsâ„¢ M-280 Streptavidin; Invitrogen) (10 Î¼g; 6â€“7 Ã— 105 beads) was first washed twice with
1Ã— Binding buffer. The beads were then incubated with 2 Î¼L of 10 Î¼M RE-flanking oligo in rotation at RT
for 20 min. The beads were washed 3 times with 1Ã— Binding buffer. Finally the beads were resuspended in
1Ã— Binding buffer and kept at 4 Â°C for later use.
2.5. Clinical HPV DNA sample
All procedures used in this research were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinling Hospital (Nanjing, China). All participants were
recruited from the Jinling Hospital with informed consent. The clinical HPV detection was performed by
Jinling Hospital (Nanjing, China) using a human papillomavirus genotyping (type 23) detection kit
(PCR-reverse dot hybridization method) (Asia Energy Biotechnology, Shenzhen). The gDNA extraction
and HPV detection (a PCR-reverse dot hybridization method) were all performed with this kit. DNA was
first tested by hospital and then the left DNA was brought to our laboratory. Two batches of clinical DNA
samples were detected by CADD.
2.6. Beads-HCR detection

30 nM dCas9 protein (dCas9 Nuclease, S. pyogenes, M0652, New England Biolabs), 1â€“4Ã— 104
Beads@oligo, 40 U RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUT â„¢ Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor, Invitrogen), and
various amount of DNA sample (see figures). The reaction was incubated at RT for 15 min in rotation. The
beads were then washed 3 times with 1Ã— Binding buffer. The beads were added 20 ÂµL of HCR solution
(0.2 Î¼M FAM-hairpin-1, 0.2 Î¼M FAM-hairpin-2 and 1Ã— Binding buffer) and incubated at RT for 15 min in
rotation. The beads were then dropped on slide glass and covered with a cover glass. The beads were
imaged with a fluorescence microscope. The beads images were analyzed with Image pro.

Single-target Beads-ELISA detection reaction (20 ÂµL) contained 1Ã— Binding buffer, 15 nM sgRNAa, 15
nM sgRNAb, 30 nM dCas9 protein, 1â€“4Ã—104 Beads@oligo, 0.5 ÂµM oligo re-biotin (Table S3), 40 U RNA
Enzyme inhibitor, and DNA sample (see figures for amount). Multi-target Beads-ELISA detection reaction
(20 ÂµL) contained 1Ã— Binding buffer, 15 nM each of sgRNAa, 15 nM each of sgRNAb, 15Ã— N nM dCas9
protein, 1â€“4Ã—104 Beads@oligo, 0.5 ÂµM oligo re-biotin, 40 U RNase inhibitor, and various amount of DNA
sample (see figures); where N is the number of targets detected. The reaction was incubated at RT for 15
min in rotation. The beads were then washed three times with a washing buffer (1Ã— dCas9 buffer contained
10 U of RNase inhibitor and 0.5% BSA), in which 1Ã— dCas9 buffer can be purchased from New England
Biolabs as NEBuffer 3.1 or prepared at home. The beads were incubated with 20 Âµl washing buffer
containing of 8 ng of HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai) for 3 min. The beads were
washed three times with the washing buffer and finally re-suspended in 30 Âµl of washing buffer. The beads
were transferred into microplate and added 50 Âµl of TMP chromogenic solution for ELISA (P0209-100ml;
Beyotime). The beads were incubated at RT for 10 min. The microplate was read at 630 nm and imaged
with a BioRad gel imager in staining-free mode.
2.8. Microplate-ELISA detection
An amino-modified oligo RE-NH2 (Table S3) was covalently coupled to the DNA-BIND 96-well
microplate (Corning) according to the instructions of manufacturer to prepare the oligo-coated microplate.
Single-target Microplate-ELISA detection reaction (80 ÂµL) contained 1Ã—Binding buffer, 15 nM sgRNAa,
15 nM sgRNAb, 30 nM dCas9 protein, 0.5 ÂµM oligo re-biotin (Table S3), 40 U RNA Enzyme inhibitor,
and various amount of DNA sample (see figures). Multi-target Microplate-ELISA detection reaction (80
ÂµL) contained 1Ã— Binding buffer, 15 nM each of sgRNAa, 15 nM each of sgRNAb, 15 nM Ã— N dCas9
protein, 0.5 ÂµM oligo re-biotin (Table S3), 40 U RNase inhibitor, and various amount of DNA sample (see
figures); where N is the number of targets detected. The reaction was added to the oligo-coated microplate.
The microplate was incubated at RT for 15 min on a horizontal mixer and then washed three times with the
washing buffer. The microplate was added with 100 ÂµL of washing buffer containing 8 ng of
HRP-conjugated Streptavidin and incubated at RT for 3 min. The microplate was then washed three times
with the washing buffer. The microplate was then added with 30 Î¼L of washing buffer and 50 Î¼L TMP
chromogenic solution for ELISA (Beyotime). The microplate was incubated for 10 min. The microplate
was read at 630 nm and imaged with a BioRad gel imager in staining-free mode.
3. Results
3.1. Beads-HCR CADD detection
To explore the feasibility of CADD, we first designed a Beads-HCR method (Fig. 1A), in which the
fluorescent hybrid chain reaction (HCR) was used as signal readout. A pair of sgRNA were designed for a
target DNA. Different from the traditional sgRNA, the sgRNA used by CADD was designed to have a
short extended 3 â€² terminal capture sequence that can anneal with other functional oligonucleotides. In
detection, a pair of dCas9-sgRNA (dCas9-sgRNAa and dCas9-sgRNAb) first binds the target DNA. The
dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is then captured onto the surface of beads via annealing between the capture
sequence on the sgRNAa and a complementary oligonucleotide coupled on beads. The beads are then
washed on magnet and then two HCR Hairpins (Hairpin 1 and Hairpin 2) are added. The capture sequence
of sgRNAb can anneal with Hairpin 1 to initiate HCR. Because the Hairpins are labeled by fluorescein,
fluorescent signal can be produced on the surface of beads by HCR.
To investigate whether the designed HCR reaction is feasible, we tested the prepared Hairpin 1 and
Hairpin 2 in liquid-phase HCRs with sgRNAa plus sgRNAb, sgRNAa, sgRNAb, and initiator oligo,
6

respectively. The results show that HCR reaction was only initiated by sgRNAb (Fig. S1), indicating that
the capture sequence of sgRNAb annealed with Hairpin 1. The oligo Initiator (Table S3) is a positive
control that can also anneal with Hairpin 1 to initiate HCR (Fig. S1).
With the reliable Hairpins and sgRNAb, we first detected the HPV16 DNA (pMD-HPV16) with
Beads-HCR CADD using sgRNAs targeting HPV16 (sgRNA16). The results show that pMD-HPV16 can
be quantitatively detected by the method (Figs. 1B and 1C). To investigate the specificity of Beads-HCR
detection, we then detected pMD-HPV16 and pMD-HPV18 with Beads-HCR CADD using sgRNA16,
sgRNA18, and sgRNAct, respectively. SgRNAct is an equimolar mixture of sgRNAs of 15 hrHPVs. The
results show that the two genotypes of HPVs can be specifically by the method (Figs. 1D and 1E).
To further explore the feasibility and specificity of Beads-HCR CADD to test HPVs, we detected all
clinical hrHPVs with the method. Fifteen genotypes of hrHPVs (pMD-HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51,
52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 73) were detected with various sgRNAsp and sgRNAct, in which sgRNAsp
means sgRNA specific to a particular genotype of HPV (such as sgRNA16). The empty vector pMD was
used as a negative control. The results indicate that each HPV can be specifically detected by its cognate
sgRNAsp and sgRNAct (Fig. 2, Fig.3, and supplementary File 1). The negative control pMD was not
detected by any sgRNAs. These data indicate that the designed sgRNAs have high specificity when
detecting 15 hrHPVs with Beads-HCR CADD.
In order to investigate whether Beads-HCR CADD can be used to detect HPV DNA in human gDNA,
we next detected gDNAs of three cervical cancer cell lines using sgRNA16, sgRNA18 and sgRNAct.
HeLa and SiHa cells are known with HPV18 and HPV16 infection, respectively, and C-33a is known
without HPV infection. The results indicate that the HeLa gDNA was detected by sgRNA18 and sgRNAct,
the SiHa gDNA was detected by sgRNA16 and sgRNAct, and C-33a gDNA was not detected by any
sgRNA (Fig. S2). These results indicate that Beads-HCR CADD is qualified for detection of more
complicated DNA sample than HPV plasmid.
In order to investigate whether Beads-HCR CADD can be used to detect clinical sample, we then
detected 31 clinical DNA samples with sgRNAsp of 15 hrHPVs and sgRNAct. The results are shown as
Fig. 4 and supplementary File 2. We compared the HPV detection results of these 31 clinical samples
tested by Beads-HCR CADD and PCR-reverse dot hybridization method that was performed by Jinling
Hospital (Fig. 4C). In comparison with the hospital tests, the hrHPV infection (yes or no) and genotype are
accurately detected by Beads-HCR CADD with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, the
Beads-HCR CADD also found multiple infections in samples 2, 11, and 37 that were not detected by the
PCR-reverse dot hybridization (Fig. 4C). These multiple infections were confirmed by a PCR re-detection
(PCR-rd) (Fig. S3), in which HPV45 and HPV59 infection were detected by PCR using primers specific to
the two HPVs (Supplementary method and Table S3). These results indicate that Beads-HCR CADD can
be used to detect hrHPV infections in clinical samples with high sensitivity and specificity.
Finally, to investigate whether DNA other than virus DNA could be detected by Beads-HCR CADD,
we also detected two types of other DNA. One is bacterium DNA and the other is human oncogenic DNA
(Supplementary methods). The sgRNAs targeting T7 RNA polymerase DNA and oncogenic telomerase
reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter were designed (Table S1). The results indicate that the T7 RNA
polymerase DNA fragment could be quantitatively detected by Beads-HCR (Fig. S4A and S4B). In
addition, the subsequent detection of gDNA from two different E. coli (DH5Î± and BL21) indicate that the
T7 RNA polymerase DNA in BL21 gDNA could be also specifically and quantitatively detected by
Beads-HCR CADD (Fig. S4C and S4D). The DH5Î± gDNA that contains no T7 RNA polymerase DNA did
not produce fluorescence signal even at the highest amount (Fig. S4C and S4D). The detection of TERT

promoter DNA indicate that the ontogenetic TERT promoter can be specifically detected by Beads-HCR
CADD using a sgRNAs targeting mutated TERT promoter (Fig. S5). The mutant TERT promoter causes
expression of telomerase, which results in malignant cell proliferation in more than 90% of cancers. It
should be noted that the detected TERT promoter has only one base difference between the wild-type and
mutant genotype (Fig. S6), indicating that CADD has high specificity that can discriminate single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).
3.2. Beads-ELISA CADD detection
Because Beads-HCR CADD is dependent on fluorescent microscope, we then expect to realize a CADD
with visual readout. We therefore designed a Beads-ELISA form of CADD (Fig. 5A). In this format of
CADD, after dCas9-sgRNA binds target DNA and the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is captured on beads
surface via sgRNAa, a biotinylated oligonucleotide is captured by sgRNAb. The HRP-labeled streptavidin
is then associated with biotin. Finally a soluble chromogenic substrate TMB is used to develop color signal.
The detection results can thus be read either qualitatively with naked eyes or quantitatively with microplate
reader.
As a pilot assay, we first detected pMD-HPV16 with Beads-ELISA CADD. The results indicate that
pMD-HPV16 can be quantitatively detected by this method (Fig. 5Bâ€“5D). In this assay, pMD was also
used as a negative control. It cannot produce color even at the highest concentration (100 pM). We then
detected 15 hrHPVs with this method using various sgRNAsp and sgRNAct. The results indicate that each
hrHPV were specifically detected by its cognate sgRNAsp and sgRNAct (Fig. 6A and 6B). The negative
control pMD was not detected by any sgRNA. To check if this method can detect multiple infections, we
subsequently detected seven mixtures of two different hrHPVs using various sgRNAsp and sgRNAct. The
results reveal that the simulated multiple infections were specifically detected by this method (Figs.6C and
6D). To further check the detection specificity, we finally detected several hrHPVs and clinical DNA
samples with this method. The results demonstrate that each hrHPV was detected by its cognate sgRNAsp
and sgRNAct (Fig. 6E); however, all single or mixed clinical DNA samples were not detected by any
sgRNA (Fig. 6E). Because the clinical DNA samples were selected from the Beads-HCR CADD-detected
samples, we focused on investigating if false positive can be produced by sgRNA when detecting clinical
samples. The results reveal that all selected clinical samples were not detected by any sgRNA, further
indicating the high specificity of this method.
3.3. Microplate-ELISA CADD detection
To further simplify the Beads-ELISA CADD and also try a new solid support other than beads, we
designed a Microplate-ELISA form of CADD (Fig.7A). In this method, a capture oligonucleotide is
coupled in microplate. The dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex will be captured in microplate through annealing
between the 3'-end capture sequence of sgRNAa and the capture oligonucleotide. The signal reporting
system is completely the same as the Beads-ELISA CADD.
To verify this method, we first detected pMD-HPV16 using sgRNA16. The results indicate that
pMD-HPV16 can be quantitatively detected by this method (Figs. 7B and 7C). The negative control pMD
did not generate a signal at the highest concentration (Figs. 7B and 7C). We then detected 33 new clinical
samples with this method using various sgRNAsp and sgRNAct. The results reveal that all samples were
detected by this method (Fig. 8A and 8B). In comparison with the results obtained by hospital tests using
the PCR-reverse dot hybridization, the Microplate-ELISA CADD accurately detected the infections of 15
hrHPVs (yes or no) and genotypes with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the
Microplate-ELISA CADD also identified more multiple infections in Samples 2, 5, 15, and 33. To confirm

the test results, we re-detected the five samples with Microplate-ELISA. The results confirm that the
Microplate-ELISA CADD can more accurately identify multiple infections in clinical samples than the
current method used in clinics (Fig. 8D and 8E).
4. Discussion
In this study, we designed a new CRISPR/Cas9-based DNA detection technique and validated it by
detecting three types of DNA including bacteria DNA, human cancer cell DNA and virus DNA. We also
verified three forms of CADD method by detecting 15 hrHPV plasmids and as many 64 clinical cervical
samples. These investigations demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of CADD method. In comparison,
CADD has its unique advantages over the current CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection methods. Different
from the current widely known CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection methods that mainly rely on Cas
enzymes with collateral cleavage activity such as Cas13a, Cas12a, Cas12b, and Cas14, we develops a new
DNA detection method based on a most widely used Cas protein, CRSIPR/Cas9, that has no collateral
cleavage activity. CADD relies on neither the specific enzymatic activity nor non-specific collateral
cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas proteins as all the current CRISPR-based methods. Therefore, CADD is
mechanistically distinct from the current CRISPR-based methods (such as SHERLOCK, DECTECTR, and
HOLMES). CADD employs dCas9 that has no enzymatic activity. CADD uses the dCas9-sgRNA as a
DNA-binding complex with high sequence specificity.
This study indicates that CADD can be used to detect and type various target DNA molecules with high
simplicity, sensitivity and specificity. Although the current CRISPR-based methods are reported to have
ultrahigh detection sensitivity (aM), they are all challenged by tedious pre-treatments to DNA/RNA
samples including various amplifications using RPA, LAMP, PCR, asymmetric PCR and in vitro
transcription. These pre-amplifications not only complicate the detection process and increase the detection
time and cost, but also may increase false negative, because pre-amplification with various DNA
polymerases may introduce mutations into DNA that is then enzymatically detected by various Cas
proteins. Importantly, amplicon spread and contamination is always a serious issue in all detection spots.
CADD needs no any pre-treatment to DNA sample. Beads-HCR CADD is an enzyme-free method.
Beads/Microplate-ELISA CADD only need a widely used enzyme HRP to develop signal. All three forms
of CADD methods can be performed without depending on any modular heaters. Another advantage of
CADD is free of traditional hybridization at high temperature. The whole CADD process is carried out at
room temperature. The time-consuming and instrument-dependent hybridization and amplification are key
limitations to the on-the-spot application of the current nucleic acid tests. Due to these advantages, CADD
will have wide applications in future DNA detection.
The CADD signal readout can be versatile. In this study, two forms of CADD signal readouts were
verified, fluorescent and colorimetric readout. The Beads-HCR CADD uses fluorescent readout by
employing the fluorescently labeled HCR hairpins. The Beads/Microplate-ELISA uses colorimetric
readout, in which the TMB color development catalyzed by streptavidin-coupled HRP is used as a visual
readout. The Beads/Microplate-ELISA CADD is an instrument-free test. In addition, the
Microplate-ELISA assay allows automatic measurement of hundreds of samples on standard plate reader in
a high-throughput format. The whole detection process of Beads-HCR and Microplate-ELISA can be
finished in 30 minutes, holding promise for rapid on-the-spot detection or point-of-care testing (POCT). In
fact, other forms of CADD signal readouts can be realized by a few changes of the solid support and signal
reporter, such as lateral flow readout, nano-gold colorimetric assay, and molecular beacon-HCR.

The high specificity of CADD has close relationship with the high sequence specificity of
dCas9-sgRNA as a DNA-binding complex. Additionally, the high specificity of CADD is also dependent
on its unique detection mechanism, in which a pair of sgRNAs commonly determine the final detection
results, providing a double-insurance sequence-specific detection. This overcomes the potential false
positive results resulted from potential off-target binding of one dCas9-sgRNA. This problem still
challenges all current CRISPR-based methods including SHERLOCK, DECTECTR and HOLMES, in
which only one-site target cutting can activate a collateral cleavage activity. Due to the signal amplification
produced by collateral cleavage activity, detections based on such one-site activation may be prone to false
positives.
HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus that is closely related to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, anal
cancer and other cancers (43). There are about 100 different types of HPV. According to different
carcinogenic capabilities, HPV is divided into high-risk HPV (hrHPV) and low-risk HPV (lrHPV). The
most common hrHPVs in the world are HPV16 and HPV18, which cause about 70% of cervical cancers
(44,45). Other hrHPVs include HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 73. Because of its
rich DNA polymorphism, HPV is a good experimental material for study DNA detection and typing
technology. Therefore, we uses HPV DNA as a material to validate three forms of CADD method in this
study. With the results obtained, this study validated a set of sgRNAs targeting hrHPVs and three forms of
CADD technique that can be directly used to detect clinical samples. When applied to clinical test, the
Beads-HCR test can be finished in 30 min, much faster than the current HPV clinical tests. If clinician only
wants to know if a clinical sample is infected by hrHPVs (screening test), the sample can only be rapidly
tested with sgRNAct. If the sample is then needed to identify hrHPV genotype, it can then be tested by
various sgRNAsp. In addition, many cervical samples can be tested in high throughput with the
Microplate-ELISA test by using the current available automated liquid handling systems.
5. Conclusion
We designed a new CRISPR/Cas9-based DNA detection technique. We then validated this technique by
detecting three types of DNA including bacteria DNA, human cancer cell DNA and virus DNA. This
technique has significant advantages over the current CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection techniques.
Especially, we designed a set of sgRNAs that are specific to 15 hrHPVs. By detecting plasmids containing
the L1 fragment of 15 hrHPVs and 64 clinical DNA samples with three forms of CADD method, we
demonstrates that CADD provides a new simple and rapid HPV test technique.
