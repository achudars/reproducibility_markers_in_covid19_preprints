Abstract

8

Background: SARS-CoV-2 genotyping has been instrumental to monitor virus evolution and transmission

9

during the pandemic. The reliability of the information extracted from the genotyping efforts depends

10

on a number of aspects, including the quality of the input material, applied technology and potential

11

laboratory-specific biases. These variables must be monitored to ensure genotype reliability. The

12

current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome

13

sequences in studies of viral spread and evolution.

14

Results: We used clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes to evaluate the impact of experimental

15

factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination using an

16

amplicon-based approach. We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently

17

detect variants in the genome at frequencies of 10% or higher. The broad applicability of our

18

recommendations was validated in >200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories. The

19

genotypes of clinical isolates with viral load above the recommended threshold cluster by sampling

20

location and period. Our analysis also supports the rise in frequency of 20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, two

21

recently reported European strains whose dissemination was favoured by travelling during the summer

22

2020.

23

Conclusions: We present much-needed recommendations for reliable determination of SARS-CoV-2

24

genome sequence and demonstrate their broad applicability in a large cohort of clinical samples.

Background

4

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Coronaviridae family,

5

causes a respiratory syndrome and is at the origin of the pandemic that started at the end of 2019 (1–

6

3). Rapid worldwide spread of this pathogen, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands, has

7

led to an unprecedented global effort to characterize its genome. Genomic epidemiology, where

8

pathogen genotype information is used to track the spread of a disease, is indispensable for public

9

health monitoring and for high-resolution contact tracing (4,5). For example, genotyping efforts

10

allowed to detect an increase in the prevalence of D614G amino-acid variant in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike

11

protein-encoding gene (23403:A->G) (6,7); and provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 mink-human

12

transmission (8). Although the clinical relevance of these and similar observations remains

13

controversial (9), virus mutation and cross-species transmission have the potential to change the

14

disease severity and facilitate evasion of the immune response (10) and must be monitored. The

15

unprecedented extent and speed of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing since the beginning of the

16

pandemic (e.g. 175’000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited as of November 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org)

17

is a testimony of how crucial genotyping has been in attempting to understand and control virus

18

transmission.

19

Such a large increase in genomic information is inevitably associated with genome submissions of

20

variable quality, depending on laboratory-specific protocol implementation and practices, sample

21

quality, genotyping method and data processing approaches. The genotyping errors introduced as a

22

consequence of these different factors can impact the conclusions of downstream analyses (11–13).

23

Even stringently selected complete genome assemblies obtained from public repositories seem to

24

contain a significant fraction of inaccuracies (14).

25

Broadly applicable guidelines that take into account the performance metrics of different genotyping

26

approaches are essential to limit the number of inaccurate variant calls in viral sequences submitted to

27

public repositories and used in genomic epidemiology studies. The sensitivity, specificity and limit of

detection are dependent of the chosen method (15). Amplicon-based methods are the most widely

2

used approach for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping due to their relative low cost and simplicity (16–22). Despite

3

their widespread use, amplicon-based technologies are associated with source-specific factors that, if

4

not accounted for, can affect the reliability of assigned genotypes (11–14) and impact, for example,

5

the measurements of viral intra-host variability (23). Previous efforts to genotype the Zika virus using

6

amplicon-based approaches suggested that the fraction at which a variant can be confidently separated

7

from technical noise is no lower than 3% even when sufficient input material, sequencing depth and

8

replicates are used (24). However, some of the variants considered in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 intra-

9

host genome variability were reported at lower fractions (25–27). Furthermore, data generated by

10

different laboratories might contain specific biases, compromising their direct comparison and the

11

validity of downstream analysis (11,12). It is thus essential to provide guidelines and technical

12

recommendations to enable accurate SARS-CoV-2 genotyping and robust comparisons across multiple

13

institutions.

14

In this work, we aimed to establish guidelines for the implementation of amplicon-based SARS-CoV-2

15

genotyping. We evaluated the impact of viral load, sequencing depth and coverage uniformity on assay

16

performance using synthetic reference SARS-CoV-2 genomes. To ensure the wide applicability of our

17

conclusions, we performed a multicentre validation study where we benchmarked the same

18

experimental protocol applied to over 200 clinical samples in six independent laboratories across

19

Europe (Figure 1A). We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 variants with frequencies of 10% or higher can be

20

reproducibly detected with sufficient input material and sequencing depth. Our study provides general

21

recommendations for reliable determination of viral genome sequences using amplicon-based methods

22

for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping.

Results

2

Benchmarking of SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based genotyping using synthetic genome control

3

The commonly used amplicon-based genotyping method used here is based on generation of 343

4

partially overlapping amplicons split in two pools, covering positions 36-29844 (99.89%) of the SARS-

5

CoV-2 genome (18). Briefly, viral genomic RNA is converted into cDNA and subsequently amplified by

6

PCR with two sets of primer pairs resulting in two amplicon pools. After combining these pools,

7

amplicons undergo a second PCR step where sequencing adapters are added (Figure S1A, Additional

8

File 1).

9

We first used synthetic RNA controls of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to investigate how the quality of viral

10

genome sequencing data is impacted by the number of viral genome copies in a sample. We spiked 50

11

ng of reference human RNA with varying amounts of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 genome (1-100’000 genome

12

copies per reaction (g.c.p.r.), the equivalent of ~0.1-10’000 viral genome copies per ml). The synthetic

13

SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of six individual RNA molecules, each ~5 kb in length. We processed and

14

sequenced these samples, in replicates, at a median depth of 1.1M reads. The virtual absence of

15

sequencing reads mapping to the human transcriptome (Figure 1B) or genome (Figure S1B, Additional

16

File 1) supports the specificity of the assay and alleviates the legal, ethical and technical concerns

17

resulting from the presence of patient sequence information seen in metagenomic or capture-based

18

methods (3,28,29).

19

We systematically detected and removed sequencing artifacts generated by primer dimers, short

20

uninformative reads, mispriming events and adapter dimers (Figure S1A, Additional File 1). The

21

efficiency of the expected product amplification increased with the viral load (Figure S1C and S1D,

22

Additional File 1). As expected, the total fraction of effective reads (i.e. reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2

23

genome after read filtering) correlated with the number of viral copies in the sample (Figure 1C). For

24

example, fewer than half of the reads mapped to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome in samples with 20

25

or less viral g.c.p.r. (Figure 1C). Inclusion of sequencing artifacts resulted in both false-negative and

26

false-positive calls (Figure S1E, Additional File 1). This lead to inaccurate variant calling and genotype

27

assignment, as demonstrated in experiments with SARS-CoV-2-Control 1 (hereafter SARS-CoV-2-C1,

Guidelines for reliable detection of clonal variants

6

Coverage breadth (% of genome covered) and depth (number of reads covering each position) are

7

critical determinants of genotyping reliability. We observed that both depended on the number of viral

8

genome copies in the input material. For example, samples containing fewer than 50 SARS-CoV-2

9

g.c.p.r. displayed only partial genome coverage (Figure 2A and S2A, Additional File 1). We aimed to

10

establish the number of sequencing reads required to achieve >10x genome coverage across at least

11

98% of positions. To this end, we randomly downsampled the number of mapping reads to defined

12

values between 5K and 500K in samples with 10’000 g.c.p.r. These samples were chosen due to low

13

fraction of artifacts (<11% discarded reads) and large number of available replicates (n=15). We

14

determined coverage breadth (Figure 2B) and depth (Figure 2C), as a function of the number of

15

mapped reads. We found that at least 200K mapped 150 bp paired-end reads are required to ensure

16

98% genome coverage with an average depth of 683x and with 93% of coverage uniformity (defined as

17

fraction of genome positions falling within a range between 20% and 500% of the median coverage)

18

(Figure S2B, Additional File 1). An increase in the number of mapped reads did not translate into any

19

significant improvement in coverage breadth, depth or uniformity (Figures 2B, 2C and S2B, Additional

20

File 1).

21

Library preparation and sequencing introduce errors that need to be distinguished from true variants to

22

ensure reliable genotyping results. To investigate the impact of sequencing depth on clonal variant

23

calling we used samples containing SARS-CoV-2-C1. We determined that the sensitivity of clonal variant

24

calling achieved 100% at all depths above 50K mapped reads for SNVs (Figure 2D). The 10-nucleotide

25

deletion present in SARS-CoV-2-C1 was initially omitted in the analysis as the overlap between the

26

annealing site of one of the amplicon primers and this region of the viral genome strongly decreased

27

the PCR efficiency (Figure S2C, Additional File 1). Achieving 100% sensitivity when taking the deletion

1

into account required at least 800K reads (Figure 2D). We conclude, that for variants that do not

2

significantly impair PCR amplification, the recommended number of 200K mapped reads is sufficient to

3

reliably call SNVs.

4

The sequencing depth required to achieve adequate number of mapped reads was inversely

5

proportional to the number of viral genome copies in the sample (Figure 2E). For samples with fewer

6

than 1000 viral g.c.p.r. the coverage uniformity (average 51.2%) (Figure S2D, Additional File 1) and

7

the percentage of genome covered (average 67.9%) (Figure S2A, Additional File 1) were highly

8

variable. This reflects the technical challenges of handling samples with relatively low input material,

9

which can hinder reliable viral genotyping. To ensure confident variant calling we recommend

10

restricting viral genotyping to samples with 1000 or more viral copies g.c.p.r. For these samples the

11

fraction of effective reads in our dataset is relatively stable: at least 740K per million reads (K/M) (910

12

+/-65K/M on average). For samples with similar or higher viral load, we advise sequencing to a depth of

13

at least 270K reads to achieve the recommended ~200K mapped reads.

14

Limits of performance for intra-host variability measurement

15

Next, we aimed to determine the lowest allele fraction which can be confidently measured using the

16

recommended minimal viral load of 1000 g.c.p.r. We mixed defined amounts of SARS-CoV-2-C1, SARS-

17

CoV-2-C2 and SARS-CoV-2 Control 4 (MT106054.1, hereafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2-C4) to obtain

18

alleles fractions between 0.01 and 0.2 (Figure 3A). SARS-CoV-2-C4 has seven SNVs relative to the

19

reference genome, which together with SARS-CoV-2-C1 yielded 10 SNVs per sample in total. We spiked

20

1000 viral genome copies of these mixes into 50 ng of human RNA, processed and sequenced the

21

samples in 4 replicates for each variant allele frequency (VAF) (median sequencing depth 1.4M reads).

22

To assess the reliability of low frequency variant detection at the recommended 200K, we randomly

23

down-sampled mapped reads to this number and performed variant calling, treating the known SNVs as

24

true positive calls and all other SNVs passing the variant caller filters as false positives generated by

25

the technical noise (Figure 3B). Detected variants that we attributed to technical noise had similar

26

average VAF across samples (average VAF=0.018). At this sequencing depth, and for 1000 g.c.p.r., the

27

VAF of >95% of these false-positive variants was lower than the VAF of true-positives in samples with

1

expected variant fractions of 0.1 or higher. The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves plotted

2

for samples with different expected variant fractions (Figure 3C) showed that at 0.1 expected VAF the

3

separation between the true and false positive calls was within an acceptable range for this type of

4

analysis, with 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity. As expected, the accuracy increased at higher target

5

VAF, with variants present at 0.2 expected VAF being detected with 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity,

6

for example.

7

To assess the impact of the number of mapped reads on variant calling performance, we repeated

8

variant calling with down-sampled datasets (100K-1.2M reads). As expected, higher numbers of mapped

9

reads resulted in increased sensitivity (Figure 3D and 3E) and specificity (Figure 3F) but the increase

10

was modest above 200K reads. Variants present at VAF=0.05 or lower could not be accurately detected

11

in the tested conditions as reflected by low sensitivity and specificity (Figure 3E and 3F).

12

We performed variant calling on sequencing results obtained with samples bearing 100, 1000 or 10K

13

g.c.p.r. to investigate the impact of viral load on genotyping accuracy (Figure S3A, Additional File 1).

14

We observed that using 100 g.c.p.r. resulted in a clear decrease in variant calling reliability, relative to

15

1000 g.c.p.r. (Figure S3B and S3C, Additional File 1). Even if the measured VAF was less variable for

16

samples with higher viral load (Figure S3D, Additional File 1), using 10K viral genomes did not further

17

improve the accuracy of variant detection.

18

In summary, we demonstrated that in order to confidently detect clonal variants, at least 1000 viral

19

genomes are required in the input material and at least 200K mapped reads are recommended. In these

20

conditions, variants present at a 10% or higher frequency can be accurately detected.

21

Multicentre study design for assessment of robust SARS-CoV-2 genotyping

22

Our analysis using synthetic genome controls provided comprehensive information on how viral genome

23

counts impacts several sequencing quality metrics and allowed us to define guidelines to ensure

24

sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based genotyping for samples with known viral load.

25

However, the exact number of viral genomes is unknown for most clinical isolates. To address this

26

limitation, we sought to translate our guidelines and make them broadly applicable to the analysis of

27

clinical samples.

1

Towards this end, we designed a multicentre study involving six independent laboratories across Europe

2

(Figure 4A and Table 1). Each institution received the same general protocol for the implementation

3

of the amplicon-based genotyping method (18). Nonetheless, the specific setup (e.g. sample collection,

4

RNA extraction, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) test, choice of replicate samples)

5

was left to the discretion of each laboratory. The raw sequencing data for 227 clinical samples (Table

6

1) was processed using the same analysis workflow to ensure comparable results.

7

In the clinical setting, the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, which correlates with the number of

8

viral copies (Figure S4A, Additional File 1), is commonly used as a proxy for the number of SARS-CoV-2

9

genomes in the sample. For the samples included in this study the Ct values varied between 12 and 38

10

(median Ct = 23, Figure S4B, Additional File 1). These values were provided by the source laboratory

11

and obtained using distinct RT-qPCR assays, which we anticipate should maximize the universal

12

applicability of our conclusions (Table 1). To investigate the impact of the method and operator on Ct

13

estimates, samples containing 1-100’000 SARS-CoV-2-C2 g.c.p.r. were analysed by RT-qPCR in two

14

independent labs using different assays (30,31). We found that the Ct values obtained from these

15

samples using independent methods are highly correlated (Figure S4A, Additional File 1) as previously

16

found (32). Calibration results suggest that samples with 1000 g.c.p.r. should generally yield Ct values

17

in the range of 29-31, consistent with previous reports (30–32). Accordingly, 96% of clinical samples

18

with Ct of less than 29 had at least 98% genome coverage breadth (99.6% on average) (Figure 4B and

19

S4C, Additional File 1) and 81% yielded at least 750K mapped reads per million (Figure 4C).

20

Similarly to what was observed in the experiments with synthetic RNA, no improvement in the genome

21

coverage breadth was observed above the recommended value of 200K mapped reads for these samples

22

(Figure 4D). For samples with Ct lower than 26, we typically obtained between 70-90% of mapped

23

reads. For these samples we recommend sequencing to a depth of ~280K reads to ensure sufficient

24

genome coverage breadth and depth. Samples with Ct values between 26 and 30 display generally good

25

coverage breadth (Figure 4B) and uniformity (Figure 4E) but variable fraction of effective reads

26

(Figure 4C) and therefore should be sequenced at a higher depth to achieve the recommended 200K

27

mapped reads and 98% coverage breadth cut-offs.

1

Based on our analysis of synthetic RNA, we recommend that samples with at least 200K mapped reads

2

and >98% coverage breadth should be used for the detection of variants (VAF ≥ 0.1) in the SARS-CoV-2

3

genome. To confirm the validity of this limit for clinical samples, we took advantage of replicates

4

present in our dataset and compared variant allele fractions measured across the replicates with more

5

than 200K mapped reads and at least 98% coverage breadth (n=13 sample pairs) (Figure 4F). Most

6

variants (99.2%, 126/127) with VAF >0.1 were reproducibly detected and their VAF values were strongly

7

correlated (Pearson r=0.996). In contrast, for variants detected in at least 1 replicate at a VAF below

8

0.1 no correlation between replicates was detected (r=-0.45). The elevated number of low frequency

9

variants in samples that do not fulfill our recommendations suggests the presence of false-positive calls

10

due to increased background noise resulting from lower quantity/quality of the viral RNA (Figure S4D

11

and S4E, Additional File 1). We conclude that for samples with sufficient viral load the variant calling

12

is reliable for alleles present at a fraction of at least 0.1.

13

Viral genotype assignment in clinical samples reflects global genome diversity.

14

One of the main goals of SARS-CoV-2 genotyping is to determine the viral strain present in the sample.

15

We performed variant calling in all unique clinical samples. We assumed that variants with VAF of 0.9

16

or higher were present in all viral genotypes of the sample and referred to these as 'clonal’ (Figure

17

5A). The remaining alleles (0.1≤VAF<0.9) were labelled as 'minor' and are likely the result of co-

18

infection by more than one virus genotype or intra-host mutations (‘quasi-species').

19

We investigated whether minor variants were more likely to result from infection by multiple viral

20

strains or else were the consequence of intra-host mutations. We estimated the pairwise sequence

21

distance between contemporaneous samples isolated in the same lab to account for the impact of

22

time-related divergence increase and differences in viral genotypes present in different European

23

countries (33) (Figure S5A, Additional File 1). The distribution of the expected number of inter-

24

sample clonal variant differences was compared to the distribution of minor alleles observed in each

25

sample, which is an estimate of intra-host genome diversity (Figure S5B, Additional File 1). The

26

number of differences observed between isolates (mean=10, mode=2) was higher than that observed at

27

intra-sample level (mean=2.8, mode=0). This observation supports that intra-host diversity is more

likely to arise from viral mutations following host infection (quasi-species) than from infection by

2

multiple strains.

3

The majority (133/135, 98.5%) of clinical samples we obtained from the various European centers was

4

characterized by the same 4 alternative alleles (at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 23403) (Figure 5A).

5

These variants, along with the fifth most frequent variant (position 25563), are repeatedly reported in

6

global datasets (11). The frequencies of clonal variants found across these clinical datasets are similar

7

to frequencies expected from samples collected during the same period at the respective location, as

8

illustrated by correlation with Shannon entropy values provided by NextStrain (33) (Pearson r=0.701

9

and p<10 ) (Figure 5B). In addition, principal component analysis supports that some variants are

10

common within samples from specific sources, likely reflecting the relationship between genetic

11

diversity and the location and the time of collection (Figure 5C). A large fraction of the variability is

12

explained by the difference between samples collected before and after July (Figure S5C, Additional

13

File 1). Almost all clinical samples collected before July 2020 belong to clade 20A, characterized by

14

the presence of variant D614G that seeded the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Europe, and its daughter clades

15

20B and 20C (Figure 5D). The increased diversity in clonal variants observed after July 2020 is

16

explained by the presence of 81.8% (36/44) of clinical isolates belonging to subclades 20A.EU1 and

17

20A.EU2. These two strains are thought to have emerged in Europe during early summer 2020 and their

18

spread across multiple European countries facilitated by increased cross-border travelling during the

19

summer holiday (34). The above results support the validity of clinical sample genotypes determined

20

using our recommendations.

21

Discussion

22

Monitoring of global and local disease spread during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires fast, sensitive

23

and precise methods for pathogen genotyping. Amplicon-based approaches are currently the most

24

widely used method in this context (16–21), yet their limits of performance have not been

25

systematically evaluated. Consequently, the quality of the genomes obtained cannot be easily

26

assessed, resulting in errors that are difficult to trace and submission of viral genome sequences of

27

poor quality to public repositories (11–14). Here, we used both synthetic RNA and clinical isolates

processed by multiple clinical laboratories to dissect the factors which need to be taken into account

2

to obtain reliable SARS-CoV-2 genome information using an amplicon-based approach (Figure 5E).

3

Variant calling accuracy strongly depends on the quality and quantity of starting material because the

4

noise level - understood as incorrect base-calls due to a combination of RT, PCR and sequencing errors

5

- is inversely correlated with the number of viral genomes and the sequencing depth. Our analysis of

6

synthetic genome controls shows that variants at VAF>0.1 can be reliably detected in samples with at

7

least 1000 g.c.p.r., which corresponds to approximately 100 viral genomes per ml. Libraries generated

8

from these samples yield at least 750K mapped reads per million sequenced reads and are sufficiently

9

complex to ensure at least 98% of genome coverage at a depth of 10 reads per nucleotide when at least

10

200K reads are mapped.

11

We used viral sample sequencing data from a multi-centre collaboration across Europe to investigate

12

how these recommendations can be implemented and what their impact is on clinical sample

13

genotypes. We show that the fraction of effectively mapping reads and the breadth of coverage can be

14

used to evaluate the quality and quantity of the original input material in diverse clinical samples.

15

Based on the qPCR calibration and the genome coverage breadth comparison we estimate that the viral

16

load of >1000 g.c.p.r. generally corresponds to samples with qPCR Ct value lower than 30. In clinical

17

samples with Ct values between 26 and 30, the fraction of effective reads is highly variable likely due

18

to various technical factors. An increase in the sequencing depth might improve coverage breadth,

19

depth and uniformity for these samples. This does not apply in cases where the genome is highly

20

degraded or low abundance (i.e. Ct>30). Our results are in agreement with recent reports showing poor

21

genome coverage for the majority of samples with Ct>30 (28,35,36). Importantly, our conclusions hold

22

true irrespective of the source lab and the specific RT-qPCR conditions, ensuring the general

23

applicability of our recommendations.

24

Despite being frequently used in clinical epidemiology (34), the variable quality of sequences deposited

25

in public repositories is hard to infer and will impact downstream analyses. Using our recommendations

26

and considering only variants at frequencies higher than the estimated limit of detection of 0.1, we

27

determined genotypes of the clinical samples from several sources. We found that as expected,

12

1

virtually all clinical samples have the D614G variant characteristic of the SARS-CoV-2 strain at the

2

origin of the European outbreak. We also detected source-specific polymorphisms and the presence of

3

representative samples from the main European clades. These include 2 strains that are thought to

4

have emerged early in the summer of 2020 and spread across Europe by tourists travelling to, and

5

from, their holiday destination, specifically in samples collected in October 2020.

6

Even if several studies report variants found at frequencies below 0.1 (25,27,37–39) only a few

7

evaluated the confidence of such calls (26,40). We found that the number of variants with VAF>0.1

8

detected in samples with at least 1000 g.c.p.r is similar between contemporaneous samples and

9

increases with time since the start of the outbreak, as expected. In contrast, in clinical samples with

10

low viral load we observed an elevated number of low frequency variants, in line with increased false

11

positive calls due to the presence of elevated noise signal. These observations illustrate the risk of not

12

considering the impact of technical factors on the accuracy of the calls in SARS-CoV-2 genotyping and

13

are a testament to the value of applying clear guidelines to select samples of sufficient quality to

14

inform genomic epidemiology studies.

15

Conclusions

16

After careful evaluation of multiple factors affecting SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based genotyping, we

17

demonstrate that at least 1000 viral copies per reaction should be used for reliable detection of variants

18

with VAF > 0.1 using amplicon-based approaches. We show that variants found in clinical isolates with

19

viral loads above this threshold allow to distinguish samples based on their geographical origin and time

20

of sampling, as expected. Widespread implementation of technical guidelines for SARS-CoV-2

21

genotyping will improve the quality of reported genotypes and the reliability of downstream analysis.

purchased from Twist Bioscience were used as input, at indicated number of copies. Individual sample

2

information is summarized in Table S1, Additional File 2. The number of viral genome copies for the

3

strain specified in the experiment was spiked into 50 ng of Universal Human Reference RNA

4

(ThermoFisher Scientific #QS0639) to the final volume of 11 μl. Libraries were prepared with CleanPlex

5

SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Paragon Genomics #918011) according to manufacturer's instructions (18). The

6

resulting libraries were quantified using Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, #Q33231)

7

and library size was estimated by capillary electrophoresis. Libraries were mixed at equimolar

8

amounts, with 5% PhiX and 150bp-long paired-end reads sequenced using Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq

9

sequencers.

10

Clinical samples

11

Clinical data was obtained from six independent European institutions (Table 1). Only samples where

12

the presence of SARS-CoV-2 could be confirmed by qPCR were considered. For a subset of clinical

13

samples samples we had either technical (n=35) or biological (n=2) replicates. Sample information is

14

summarized in Table S1, Additional File 2. All samples were processed with CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2

15

Panel (Paragon Genomics #918011) using either 25 or 50 ng total RNA as input. Resulting libraries were

16

quantified, evaluated by capillary electrophoresis and 150 bp-long pair read sequenced using Illumina

17

sequencers by the source lab. Ct values were provided by the source lab. For each sample we

18

approximated the reported Ct to the closest integer to facilitate comparisons.

19

Data processing

20

Sequencing reads alignment to the reference genome NC_045512.2 and variant calls were performed

21

with SOPHiA Genetics proprietary pipeline. Mapping to human transcriptome and genome were

22

performed using STAR (ver 2.7) (41) and bwa mem (version 0.7.12-r1039) (42), respectively. Read

23

coverage was estimated using bedtools coverage from the bedtools suite (version v2.29.2) (43) for the

24

portion of the viral genome targeted by the amplicons (positions 36-29,844 of the reference genome).

25

Genome coverage depth and breadth were calculated for each sample. Coverage uniformity is defined

26

as the fraction of genome covered at a depth in the range between the 20% and 500% of the median

27

depth. Read subsampling was performed with samtools v1.9 (44).

Determination of VAF limit of detection for intra-host variability

2

Synthetic viral genome controls (SARS-CoV-2-C2, SARS-CoV-2-C1 and SARS-CoV-2-C4) were mixed to

3

achieve the desired fraction (0-0.2) and spiked into 50 ng of human reference RNA at different defined

4

viral load between 100-10’000. Libraries were prepared, sequenced and analysed as previously

5

described. Variants called in the replicates were pooled for downstream analysis. For a given VAF

6

threshold all known variants detected above or below the expected VAF were considered to be True

7

Positives or False Negatives, respectively. Background variants were considered to be either False

8

Positives or True Negatives, when their VAF was above or below the tested threshold, respectively. We

9

used true/false positive/negative calls at different VAF to estimate the area under Receiver Operating

10

Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity with different number of mapped reads

11

and at different VAF.

12

Analysis of intra-host and inter-host diversity

13

In case of replicates only one of the samples, chosen at random, was included. Variants called with a

14

frequency between 0.01 and 0.9 were labelled as minor and variants called with a frequency of at least

15

0.9 were labelled as clonal. Only clinical samples that met the criterion of >98% genome coverage

16

breadth and at least 200K mapped reads were retained for the downstream analyses (n=135). We

17

considered samples from each individual source separately and calculated the number of all possible

18

clonal pairwise differences for all possible sample pairs. We compared the distribution of all possible

19

pairwise differences to per-sample counts of minor variants.

20

In order to compare diversity within our clinical dataset to that reported in NextStrain (33), we

21

calculated per-position Shannon entropy individually for datasets with at least 15 samples. These

22

values were then compared with values reported in NextStrain for a country and sampling period

23

matching the respective dataset. As the precise sampling date was not available for most of the

24

samples, we chose the time period since December 2019 until the month preceding the month of data

25

upload.

Figure 1. Artifact removal as a prerequisite for reliable variant calling. (A) Schematic representation of

3

the study; In experiments using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA we varied a number of experimental

parameters including viral load, VAF and sequencing depth, and determined which of these factors

5

critically impact genotyping quality (top box). We validated these metrics using data obtained from

6

clinical samples, whose viral load is reflected by the Ct value (middle box). We determined the phylogeny

using the Nextstrain platform. (E) Schematic representation of the recommendations for reliable

3

genotyping with amplicon-based approach. We used synthetic viral genomes to determine the minimal

4

viral load and VAF. We validated these recommendations and made them broadly applicable using clinical

5

samples by determining the minimal sequencing depth, fraction of mapped reads and coverage breadth.

6

Samples were classified into three quality categories based on their viral load: good (≥1000 g.c.p.r.),

7

intermediate (uncertain g.c.p.r., Ct values in the range 26-30) and bad (<100 g.c.p.r., typically value

Figure S1.
(A) Schematic representation of amplicon-based workflow and the source and type of artifacts it can
introduce in the sequencing data. The RNA is converted into cDNA and amplified, in two pools, into 343
partially overlapping amplicons (example primer design F1-R1 and F2-R2 shown). After pooling, the
amplicons are subsequently converted into sequencing libraries. These two PCR steps can introduce
different types of artifacts as illustrated by the panel on the right. (B) Distribution of the fraction of
sequencing reads aligning to human genome (y-axis) for samples with varying amounts of synthetic viral
genome (x-axis). The horizontal line in the boxplot indicates the median and the whiskers the 5% and 95%

synthetic SARS-CoV-2 genomes (indicated on the top of the lane). Fragment size based on control DNA
ladder is indicated on the left and the expected size of SARS-CoV-2 amplicons (red arrow) or artifacts (blue
arrow) is indicated on the right. (D) Fraction of DNA fragments with sizes corresponding to SARS-CoV-2
amplicon or artifact quantification from the electrophoretic library profiles obtained for samples with
varying amounts of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Bars represent average of at least 3 replicates for each
amount and whiskers the standard deviation. (E) Genome browser view examples of artifact containing
reads and their impact on inferred genotype before and after their removal; top panel depicts a SNP initially
detected only at a low VF (8%, below the cut-off for being reported in the final genome sequence); bottom
panel shows reads supporting 2 SNPs and a deletion which are not present in the final alignment.

Figure S3.
(A) Schematic representation of the experimental design for the determination of the impact of intra-host
variability on variant calling performance. Varying amounts of SARS-CoV-2 Control 1 or 4 (blue) were mixed
with SARS-CoV-2 synthetic genome reference (Control 2, orange) to obtain desired VAFs and varying viral
genome copy mixes (between 100, 1000 and 10000 g.c.p.r.) spiked into human RNA. Variant calling was
performed for samples sequenced at varying depth. (B) Distribution of the variant fraction for known
variants (y-axis), expected fraction 0.1, 0.125 and 0.18 (yellow, blue and purple) or background call (red),
