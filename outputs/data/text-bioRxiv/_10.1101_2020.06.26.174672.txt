Abstract:
The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global

25

health crisis. Currently, diagnosis is based on molecular techniques, which detect the viral

26

nucleic acids when present at detectable levels. The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2

27

was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal

28

specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR,

29

respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-

30

CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%)

31

were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay

32

and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data

33

revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%)

34

were positive for serum IgG assay. Among the 18 patients that were positive for serum IgG, 13

35

(72.2%) exhibited 1-3 symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 (27.7%) patients did not present with any

36

COVID-19 related symptoms, per CDC criteria. All 4 (100%) patients that were positive by rRT-

37

PCR had symptoms of COVID-19 disease. A longitudinal study from the inpatient population

38

suggested there was a sharp increase in the serum IgG titers in 5 patients, a moderate increase in

39

1 patient and a plateau in 3 patients. Sero-prevalence of COVID-19 disease in pre-procedure

40

patients was 5.5%. Our findings suggest serological tests can be used for appropriate patient

41

triaging when performed as an adjunct to existing molecular testing.

Introduction

43

In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan,

44

Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia 1. Subsequently,

45

pathogenic gene sequencing identified the infecting pathogen as a novel coronavirus, named

46

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)2. It has been listed as a public

47

health emergency of international concern, and, following declaration of a pandemic by the

48

World Health Organization (WHO), governments worldwide have taken drastic measures to

49

contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of millions of residents in many countries.

50

According to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA)

51

and recent reports, most COVID-19 patients have an incubation period of 2 to 14 days 3. CDC

52

has listed 11 symptoms for clinical diagnosis. Fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue are

53

the most common symptoms, whereas nasal congestion and diarrhea are only noted in a small

54

number of patients 4. Severe cases might progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome

55

(ARDS), septic shock and difficult-to-tackle metabolic acidosis, and bleeding and coagulation

56

dysfunction. Some COVID-19 patients have only mild or atypical symptoms, including, initially,

57

even some of those who go on to develop severe and critical cases 4. The chest computed

58

tomography of COVID-19 patients is characterized by the ground-glass opacity and bilateral

59

patchy shadowing 5. For laboratory tests, it has been reported that most patients had lymphopenia

60

and elevated C-reactive protein 6. However, these clinical and laboratory characteristics are not

61

easily distinguishable from pneumonia induced by infection with other common respiratory tract

62

pathogens.

63
64

The appropriate and accurate diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for
epidemiological interventions to prevent further spread within the community 7. Currently,

65

molecular testing remains the only testing method for detection of virus RNA from

66

nasopharyngeal specimens collected from suspected cases. Like many other diagnostic methods,

67

molecular testing comes with some degree of variability with respect to sensitivity and

68

specificity, mainly driven by the pre-analytical steps and kinetics of virus shedding from the

69

infected individuals. For example, studies show discordant results from different types of

70

specimens collected, naso- vs. oro-pharyngeal swabs, in COVID-19 patients 8. Additionally,

71

many cases that show strong epidemiologic links to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and with typical lung

72

radiological findings remain RNA negative in their upper respiratory tract samples. The

73

performance of molecular tests thus depends on many factors, including the sample type 9, the

74

patient’s stage of infection 10, the skill of sample collection, and the quality and consistency of

75

the PCR assays being used. Any of these factors can lead to a substantial delay in early diagnosis

76

and management, in turn delaying both timely life support treatment for the individual and

77

contact tracing and preventive quarantine to contain virus spread 11.

78

Antibody detection tests offer the opportunity to mitigate some of the challenges

79

molecular testing presents. They have faster turn-around time, high throughput, and cost less per

80

test compared to molecular testing, and thus may be a valuable adjunct where challenges to

81

timely results and/or quality sample collection for molecular testing arise.

82

Serological tests for detecting anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are new to the diagnosis of

83

Coronavirus infections. They have only rarely been utilized for diagnosis of common cold

84

Coronavirus infections, hence many laboratories lack experience in serological testing for new

85

SARS-CoV-2 and may encounter initial problems with test performance characteristics and

86

interpretation of test results in the absence of strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19.

87

We investigated the performance of an ELISA test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

88

detection, the relationship of molecular tests with serological tests in outpatient specimen and

89

concurrently collected emergency department and pre-procedure specimens, and the dynamics of

90

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in a small sample of serially-collected blood samples from

91

inpatients with confirmed COVID-19. Further, we discuss the value and potential diagnostic and

92

clinical use of serological test as an adjunct to molecular testing in these various cohorts.

93

Methods:

94

This study was reviewed and approved by the Baylor Scott and White Research Institute

95

(BSWRI) Institutional Review board (IRB # 020-122)

96

Study design and specimen source:

97

This study included outpatient, emergency department, inpatient and pre-procedure adult

98

patients from Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in Temple (Temple, TX). All adult patients

99

were screened for symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to WHO and Baylor Scott &

100

White Health (BSWH) guidelines, except pre-procedure patients.

101

Outpatient specimens:

102

Serum samples from 167 patients were collected and stored at – 200 C until tested.

103

Specimens were collected from patients presenting at BSWH outpatient clinics with suspected

104

symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 167 patients, 15 (8.9%) were confirmed positive by

105

rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and serum specimens from rRT-PCR confirmed patients

106

were drawn at ≥ 13 days after rRT-PCR test results. Additionally, 33 (19.7%) specimens were

107

collected ≤13 days after initial rRT-PCR testing. 152 (91%) serum specimens were from patients

108

who tested negative by rRT-PCR.

109

110

Emergency department (ED) specimens:

Nasopharyngeal and serum samples were concurrently collected from 151 patients who

111

visited the ED with suspected symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specimens were collected

112

from patients who exhibited at least one symptom related to COVID-19 disease as indicated by

113

CDC. Symptoms included, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,

114

fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or

115

runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.

116

Inpatient specimens:

117

Several ED patients were transitioned to inpatient status due to clinical necessity.

118

Residual serum specimens from 9 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed inpatients were collected over a

119

period of their stay in the hospital and analyzed for serum IgG.

120

Pre-procedure specimens:

121

On April 22, 2020, BSWH reopened elective surgical procedures and established a

122

screening protocol for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elective surgery patients were required to submit a

123

nasopharyngeal swab and an optional blood sample for serological testing. Accordingly, 6,271

124

paired nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were submitted by the weekend of June 12,

125

2020. Pre-procedure specimens can be considered truly random in distribution and represented

126

the central Texas general population.

127

Pre-COVID-19 specimens:

128

One hundred pre-COVID-19 serum samples were selected from the BSWH specimen

129

biobank for specificity testing of the serum IgG assay. These specimens were collected during

130

2018-19 Influenza season.

131

Data collection and analysis:

132

Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and the

133

laboratory information system. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots the

134

sensitivity against 1-specificity, or true positive rate vs. false positive rate, for all the possible

135

cutoffs. Based on a visual assessment of the ROC curve, two potential cutoffs were chosen to

136

calculate the sensitivity and specificity compared to rRT-PCR results. The final assay cutoff for

137

serological testing was prepared using outpatient test results. ROC analysis and data

138

visualization were done using EP evaluator software (Data innovations, South Burlington, VT,

139

USA).

140

Laboratory procedures

141

Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection:

142

Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were based on the rRT-

143

PCR technique approved by the US Federal Drug and Food Administration (FDA) under an

144

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)7. Briefly, all BSWH specimens were collected either at

145

drive through collection sites, emergency department or from inpatients using a flocked swab in

146

Universal or Transport Media (Copan Technologies, USA). Specimens were transported at 2 - 8

147

o

148

than 3 hours of transit time. The BSWH-Temple molecular pathology laboratory was responsible

C to the BSWH-Temple molecular pathology laboratory for processing and testing with less

149

for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by rRT-PCR methods (Luminex

150

Corporation, Austin, TX USA).

151

The SARS-CoV-2 primers were designed by Luminex to detect RNA targets from the

152

SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens from patients, as recommended for testing by public

153

health authority guidelines. Luminex Aries employs primers for amplifying the ORF1 gene and

154

the N gene from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the assay includes extraction and internal controls

155

(Human RNAase P) built into the same cartridge, to verify sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction,

156

and proper system and reagent performance. Luminex Aries offers true random-access testing,

157

unlike the Luminex NxTAG platform, an assay for batched testing (offering high throughput

158

capabilities) on which increased demand for testing necessitated verification and

159

implementation. The Luminex NxTAG method also includes an additional Envelope (E) gene

160

target for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

161

Antibody testing

162

Serum samples were collected, as stated above, from both PCR positive and negative

163

patients, and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Testing was performed as per the

164

instructions for use provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Ansh

165

Laboratories, Houston, TX, USA) uses indirect two-step immunoassay methods. In the assay,

166

calibrators and unknowns were incubated in microtiter wells coated with purified SARS-CoV2

167

recombinant antigens (spike and nucleocapsid). After incubation and washing, the wells were

168

treated with the conjugate, composed of anti-human IgG antibodies labeled with peroxidase.

169

After a second incubation and washing step, the wells were incubated with the substrate

170

tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An acidic stopping solution was then added and the degree of

171

enzymatic turnover of the substrate is determined by wavelength absorbance measurement at 450

172

nm as primary test filter and 630 nm as reference filter. The absorbance measured is directly

173

proportional to the concentration of human IgG antibodies present in the specimen. The serum

174

IgG ELISA method was automated on Dynex DSX 4-plate instrument (Dynex Technologies,

175

Chantilly, VA, USA). Calibrators and controls were run as per the manufacturer’s

176

recommendations provided in the package insert.

177

The serology assay was validated and implemented as a laboratory developed test. This

178

assay uses a three-point calibration curve. Performance characteristics were established in

179

accordance with regulatory requirements and are available for review. During internal

180

validations sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98.3% were established at the time of test

181

implementation. In this study, we used 100 pre COVID-19 specimens for additional specificity

182

testing.

183

Sample dilution experiment

184

In order to rule out non-specific binding, specimens that tested positive by ELISA assay

185

were diluted using sample diluent provided in the assay kit. Specimens were diluted 1:2, 1:4, 1:8

186

and 1:16 and were re-tested along with an undiluted specimen. Percent recovery was calculated

187

and plotted.

Results:

190

Outpatient serological testing experience and test performance:

191

A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2;

192

15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used

193

these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG and investigated the percent

194

concordance with rRT-PCR test results.

195

At a lower assay cutoff, 13 AU/mL, there was a 22.3% concordance with rRT-PCR

196

results. The percent concordance increased to 82% with increase in the assay cutoff to 35

197

AU/mL. Performance characteristics of the serum IgG assay were determined, including

198

sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, with 2 different

199

assay cutoffs, compared to rRT-PCR (Tables 1A and 1B).

200

Additionally, 15 serum specimens that were collected ≥13 days after initial positive rRT-

201

PCR test had 100% concordance with the serum IgG assay, however, 33 (19.7%) serum

202

specimens collected ≤13 days post rRT-PCR negative results were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2

203

IgG antibodies with zero percent concordance with rRT-PCR.

204

In order to address the discordance between rRT-PCR negative and serum IgG positive

205

specimens and understand if the serum IgG assay had any non-specific binding issues, we

206

retrieved five discordant serum specimens and performed a serial dilution experiment to rule out

207

non-specific binding. Serially diluted specimens exhibited a linear decline in the antibody

208

concentrations (Fig. 1), implying that non-specific binding was not an issue with the serum IgG

209

assay and the discordant specimens were truly positive. From the specimen dilution experiment

210

we were also able to determine the assay cutoff: using outpatient derived serology test results,

211

the cutoff was set at 13 AU/mL using EP evaluator software (Fig. 2).

212

Specificity of the serum IgG assay was determined using pre-COVID-19 archived serum

213

specimens. Among the 100 pre-COVID-19 specimens, none were reactive on the IgG assay,

214

further confirming the specificity of the assay at 100%. This also meant that negative predictive

215

value of the assay was 100% at the lower assay cutoff.

216

Emergency department serological testing experience

217

ED specimens, both nasopharyngeal swabs for rRT-PCR and serum for IgG assay, were

218

concurrently collected and tested. Out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by

219

rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay. Among the 18 patients that were

220

positive for serum IgG, 13 (72.2%) exhibited 1-3 symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 (27.7%)

221

patients did not present with any COVID-19 related symptoms, per CDC criteria (Table 3A).

222

Similarly, all 4 (100%) patients that were positive by rRT-PCR had symptoms of COVID-19

223

disease (Table 3B). Both serology and rRT-PCR tests were negative for 53 (39.8%) and 59

224

(40%), respectively, patients who exhibited 1 or more COVID-19 related symptoms.

225

Patients exhibiting COVD-19 related symptoms had a concordance of 72.2% with serum

226

IgG assay results, providing an opportunity to consider the patients as potential SARS-CoV-2

227

infections for triaging to appropriate COVID-19 designated wards if there was clinical necessity,

228

especially in the absence of positive rRT-PCR test results and with the high negative predictive

229

value of the serological test.

230

These ED data provide an opportunity for preventing spread of infection in the non-

231

COVID-19 wards if patients were to be falsely classified as COVID-19 negative, just based on

232

rRT-PCR results.

233

Inpatient serological testing experience:

234

Many of the ED patients were admitted as inpatients, provideing an opportunity for a

235

limited longitudinal study on the serum IgG titers from residual specimens. Data presented in

236

Fig. 3 show that there was a moderate to high increase in the serum IgG titers for a few patients

237

within a very short period. Among the 9 patients that were followed, 5 demonstrated a sharp

238

increase in the IgG titers within 1-3 days of initial testing (patient numbers 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7).

239

There was moderate increase in the IgG titers for one patient (patient number 5) while the IgG

240

levels had plateaued in 3 patients (patient numbers 3, 8 and 9).

241

Titers of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies can reflect the progress of viral infection. A sharp

242

increase in the titers within a short period suggests an ongoing and active infection; therefore,

243

these patients needed to be placed in COVID-19 designated wards to prevent cross

244

contamination. The conventional belief, for many infections, is that a rise in the serum antibody

245

titers corroborates an enduring infection.

246

Pre-procedure serological testing experience:

247

As mentioned in the methods, a total of 6,271 rRT-PCR and serum IgG tests were

248

performed by the end of June 12, 2020. Among the 6,271 rRT -PCR tests, 60 (0.95%) were

249

positive. Serum IgG test was positive for 351 (5.5%) patients among the patients who submitted

250

paired specimens for pre-procedure screening. Since the pre-procedure patient population

12

251

represented a random group from various parts of the central Texas region, we estimated sero-

252

prevalence of COVID-19 to be at 5.5% in this part of the nation.

253

Pre-procedure serological testing data clearly suggested a higher prevalence of COVID-

254

19 compared to rRT-PCR data. These findings, combined with other clinical symptoms and

255

laboratory findings, may allow careful decision making for downstream procedures, such as

256

rescheduling or use of enhanced personal protective equipment during the invasive procedure.

257

Discussion

258

Testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA has become the standard for COVID‐19 diagnosis 12.

259

However, a number of false negative results have been reported, resulting in a failure to

260

quarantine infected patients 12. If unchecked, this could cause a major setback in containing viral

261

transmission 13. Serological tests are crucial tools for assessments of SARS-CoV-2 exposure,

262

infection and potential immunity. Their appropriate use and interpretation requires accurate assay

263

performance data 14.

264

We described the use of serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in various

265

healthcare contexts, examining outpatient, emergency department, inpatient, and pre-procedure

266

patients. Outpatient data were utilized to determine the performance characteristics of the IgG

267

ELISA assay, which was validated and implemented as a laboratory-developed test. Two assay

268

cutoffs were established based on its performance compared to rRT-PCR method. Both the

269

cutoffs provided a nearly 100% negative predictive value.

270

As shown by many studies, rRT-PCR results have been variable due to pre-test

271

probabilities, however, serological tests with high specificity and negative predictive value can

13

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.174672; this version posted June 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

272

be used as an adjunct to rRT-PCR findings, combined with other clinical symptoms and

273

laboratory findings for appropriate patient care.

274

Increased virus shedding and transmission have been reported in people asymptomatic

275

for COVID-19 10. rRT-PCR findings combined with serological testing can further delineate

276

different types of infected people, including asymptomatic individuals. We have shown here that

277

both pre-procedure (asymptomatic) and ED (symptomatic) patients had higher positivity rates by

278

serological testing than rRT-PCR, including several of ED patients who were symptomatic as per

279

the CDC definition of COVID-19.

280

Interestingly, it has been shown that the typical incubation period for SARS-CoV-2

281

infection could be anywhere between 2 and 14 days, with the average being 7 days 3,8. By the

282

time patients show serious signs and symptoms, like shortness of breath, it could be greater than

283

7 days post-infection when these patients present to ED, a point at which virus load in

284

nasopharyngeal swabs could be below detectable levels. The long incubation time allows for

285

antibody development in the infected individual, and both serum IgM and IgG would begin to

286

appear at levels detectable by commercial assays 13. It is therefore important to have an assay

that has high specificity, sensitivity and negative predictive value, such as the one used here. In

288

this study, 13 (72%) out of 18 of the patients in ED were found to have COVID-19 specific

289

symptoms and tested positive for serum IgG, indicating an ongoing infection.

290

Our inpatient data were indicative of current or ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2,

291

based on the increase in the titer of specific antibodies. Several infectious diseases are diagnosed

292

based on serological tests and the diagnosis is often based on the demonstration of an increase in

293

the serum antibody levels between acute and convalescent specimens 15. We strongly believe that

294

a similar diagnostic approach is necessary for a largely unknown entity such as COVID-19,

295

perhaps with a short duration between specimens collected, as demonstrated in this study.

296

High specificity testing is crucial in low-prevalence settings, as shown in our data; the

297

ELISA test we employed had 100% specificity with a negative predictive value of 100%. We

298

evaluated 6000+ serum and nasopharyngeal swabs from pre-procedure patients and found that

299

the positivity rate was significantly higher by serological test than rRT-PCR. These pre-

300

procedure patients were asymptomatic and represented a true random sample from the central

301

Texas region. We observed 5.5% sero-prevalence in this region. Serological tests thus have a

302

significant role in downstream clinical decision-making (use of enhanced PPE or rescheduling)

303

and patient triaging to appropriate care and/or discharge.

304

The intent of this study was not to provide any guidelines or recommendations on how to

305

use anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological tests in various settings, especially since the CDC recommends

306

that serological tests alone should not be used for diagnosis. However, the CDC also

307

recommends that, in certain situations, serologic assays may be used, in conjunction with viral

308

detection tests, to support clinical assessment of persons who present late in their illnesses3. We

309

recommend that it is best left to the discretion of individual healthcare facilities and the

310

preference of scientific community as to what the specific downstream applications of

311

serological tests may be in the management of COVID-19.

312

Conclusion:

313

We demonstrated how an adjunct serological test with high negative predictive value for

314

SARS-CoV-2 infection can be leveraged for appropriate clinical decision making in various

315

clinical scenarios.
