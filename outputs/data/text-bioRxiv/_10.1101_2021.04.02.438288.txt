Summary (144/150 words)
During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is devastating the modern societies
worldwide, many variants that naturally acquire multiple mutations have emerged.
Emerging mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune
resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to
humoral immunity has recently been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that
two recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape from the
HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce the affinity to viral
receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation increases protein stability, viral
infectivity, and potentially promotes viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLArestricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and
the escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since an unusual
outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou
et al., 2020), SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread all over the world, and as of March
2021, SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing pandemic: more than one hundred million cases
of infections have been reported worldwide, and more than two million people died
of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020a).
During the current pandemic, a variety of SARS-CoV-2 mutants have
emerged and some of them have dominantly spread [reviewed in (Plante et al.,
2021)]. A well-studied SARS-CoV-2 mutant harbors D614G substitution in the spike
(S) protein. Recent studies have revealed that the D614G mutation increases the
SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (Ozono et al.,
2021; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021), infectivity (Ozono et al., 2021;
Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021), fitness (Hou et al., 2020; Plante et al.,
2020; Zhou et al., 2021), and transmissibility in the human population (Volz et al.,
2021). However, there is no evidence suggesting that the D614G variant is
associated with viral pathogenicity and lethality (Hou et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020;
Plante et al., 2020). Additionally, since the fall of 2020, new SARS-CoV-2 variants
such as B.1.1.7 (also known as a variant of concern 202012/01 or 20I/501Y.V1),
B.1.351 (also known as 20H/501Y.V2), and P.1 (also known as 501Y.V3) lineages
emerged in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil, respectively, and have rapidly spread
worldwide (CDC, 2020). At the end of 2020, another lineage, B.1.427/429 (also
known as CAL.20C), has been predominant particularly in California state, the USA
(Deng et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Moreover, cross-species viral infection can
accelerate the emergence of diversified viruses [reviewed in (Banerjee et al., 2021;
Parrish et al., 2008)]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, a variety of mammals such as
nonhuman primates (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Munster et al., 2020; Yu et al.,
2020) and carnivores (Halfmann et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) are
prone to its infection (Damas et al., 2020; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2020; OIE,
2021). Strikingly, the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.298, has likely to be
associated with the outbreak in farmed minks in Denmark (Koopmans, 2021; WHO,
2020b), and phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of mink-to-human
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Danish mink farms (Oude Munnink et al., 2021).
Because newly emerging variants can potentially change viral infectivity,
transmissibility and pathogenicity, deep monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 strains
circulating globally and locally and evaluating the effects of mutations detected on
virological characteristics are urgent and crucial.

The emergence of mutated viruses is mainly due to error-prone viral
replication, and the spread of emerged variants is attributed to the escape from
immune selective pressures [reviewed in (Duffy et al., 2008)]. In fact, several SARSCoV-2 mutants can be resistant to the neutralization mediated by the antibodies from
COVID-19 patients (Baum et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021c; McCarthy
et al., 2021; Weisblum et al., 2020) as well as those from vaccinated individuals (Liu
et al., 2021b). Although the B1.1.7 variant is sensitive to convalescent and
vaccinated sera (Collier et al., 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021;
Supasa et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), the B.1.351 and P.1 variants are relatively
resistant to anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021;
Hoffmann et al., 2021a; Wang et al., 2021).
In addition to the humoral immunity mediated by neutralizing antibodies,
another protection system against pathogens is the cellular immunity mediated by
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [reviewed in (Fryer et al., 2012; Leslie et al., 2004)].
CTLs recognize the nonself epitopes that are presented on virus-infected cells via
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, and therefore, the CTL-mediated
antiviral immunity is HLA-restricted [reviewed in (La Gruta et al., 2018)]. Recent
studies have reported the HLA-restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes that can be
recognized by human CTLs (Kared et al., 2021; Kiyotani et al., 2020; Nelde et al.,
2021; Schulien et al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021). More importantly, Bert et al. have
recently reported that the functionality of virus-specific cellular immunity is inversely
correlated to the COVID-19 severity (Le Bert et al., 2021). Therefore, it is
conceivable to assume that the HLA-restricted CTLs play crucial roles in controlling
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disorders. However, comparing to humoral
immune responses, it remains unclear whether the SARS-CoV-2 variants can
potentially escape from cellular immunity.
In this study, we investigate the possibility for the emergence of the SARSCoV-2 mutants that can escape from the HLA-restricted cellular immunity. We
demonstrate that at least two naturally occurring substitutions in the receptor binding
motif (RBM; residues 438-506) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, L452R and Y453F,
which were identified in the two major variants, B.1.427/429 (L452R) and B1.1.298
(Y453F), can be resistant to the cellular immunity in the context of HLA-A*24:02, an
allele of HLA-I. More intriguingly, the L452R and Y453F mutants increase the binding
affinity to ACE2, and the experiments using pseudoviruses show that the L452R
substitution increases viral infectivity. Furthermore, we artificially generate the
SARS-CoV-2 harboring these point mutations by reverse genetics and demonstrate
that the L452R mutants enhance viral replication capacity.

Results
Evasion from the HLA-A24-restricted CTL responses by acquiring mutations
in the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
We set out to address the possibility of the emergence of the naturally occurring
mutants that can potentially confer the resistance to antigen recognition by HLArestricted cellular immunity. A bioinformatic study has suggested that the 9-mer
peptide in the RBM, NYNYLYRLF (we designate this peptide "NF9"), which spans
448-456 in the S protein, can be the potential epitope presented by HLA-A24
(Kiyotani et al., 2020), an HLA-I allele widely distributed all over the world and
particularly predominant in East and Southeast Asian area (Table S1). Additionally,
three immunological analyses using COVID-19 convalescents have shown that the
NF9 peptide is an immunodominant epitope presented by HLA-A*24:02 (Gao et al.,
2021; Hu et al., 2020; Kared et al., 2021). To verify these observations, we obtained
the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from nine COVID-19
convalescents with HLA-A*24:02 and stimulated these cells with the NF9 peptide.
As shown in Figure 1A, a fraction of CD8+ T cells upregulated two activation markers,
CD25 and CD137, in response to the stimulation with NF9. In the nine samples of
COVID-19 convalescents with HLA-A*24:02, the percentage of the CD25+CD137+
cells in the presence of the NF9 peptide (5.3% in median) was significantly higher
than that in the absence of the NF9 peptide (0.49% in median) (Figure 1B; P=0.016
by Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Additionally, the stimulation with the NF9 peptide did
not upregulate CD25 and CD137 in the CD8+ T cells of three seronegative samples
with HLA-A*24:02 and the percentage of the CD25+CD137+ cells in seronegative
samples (0.93% in median) was significantly lower than that in COVID-19
convalescent samples (Figure 1B; P=0.011 by Mann-Whitney U test). Consistent
with previous reports (Gao et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2020; Kared et al., 2021; Kiyotani
et al., 2020), our data suggest that the NF9 peptide is an immunodominant HLAA*24:02-restricted epitope recognized by the CD8+ T cells of COVID-19
convalescents in our cohort.
We next assessed the profile of cytokine production by the NF9 stimulation.
As shown in Figure 1C, the stimulation with the NF9 peptide induced the production
of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 in the CD8+ T cells of a COVID-19 convalescent. The
analysis using six COVID-19 convalescent samples showed that CD8+ T cells
produce multiple cytokines in response to the NF9 stimulation (Figure 1D),
demonstrating the multifunctional nature of the NF9-specific CD8+ T cells of COVID19 convalescents. Moreover, the cytotoxic potential of the NF9-specific CD8+ T cells
was assessed by staining with surface CD107a, a degranulation marker (Figure 1E).
As shown in Figure 1F, the percentage of CD107a+ cells in the CD8+ T cells with

the NF9 peptide (12.9% in median) was significantly higher than that without the NF9
peptide (0.83% in median) (; P=0.031 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test), suggesting the
cytotoxic potential of the NF9-specific CD8+ T cells.
To assess the presence of naturally occurring variants harboring mutations
in this region (residues 448-456 in the S protein), we analyzed the diversity of SARSCoV-2 during the current pandemic. We downloaded 750,243 viral genome
sequences from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database
(https://www.gisaid.org; as of March 15, 2021). The L452R substitution was most
frequent among the sequences analyzed (5,677 sequence), and 1,380 sequences
reported contained the Y453F substitution (Table 1). Notably, the B.1.427/429 and
B.1.1.298 lineages (CDC, 2020) in the PANGO lineages (https://covlineages.org/index.html) mainly harbor the L452R and Y453F mutations,
respectively (Figure 1G and Table S2).
To address the possibility that the naturally occurring mutations in the NF9
region, L452R and Y453F, evade the NF9-specific CD8+ T cells of HLA-A24-positive
COVID-19 convalescents, two NF9 derivatives containing either L452R or Y453F
substitution (NF9-L452R and NF9-Y453F) were prepared and used for the
stimulation experiments. As shown in Figure S1, parental NF9 induced IFN-γ
expression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the induction level of IFN-γ
expression by the NF9-Y453F derivative was significantly lower than that by parental
NF9, and more intriguingly, the NF9-L452R derivative did not induce IFN-γ
expression even at the highest concentration tested (10 nM) (Figure S1). In the five
HLA-A24-positive COVID-19 convalescent samples, parental NF9 peptide
significantly induced IFN-γ expression, while the NF9-L452R and NF9-Y453F
derivatives did not (Figures 1H and 1I). Altogether, these results suggest that the
NF9 peptide, which is derived from the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, is an
immunodominant epitope of HLA-A24, and two naturally occurring mutants, L452R
and Y453F, evade the HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity.
Augmentation of the binding affinity to ACE2 by the L452 and Y453 mutations
We next addressed whether the mutations of interest affect the efficacy of virus
infection. Structural analyses have shown that the Y453 and N501 residues in the
RBM are located on the interface between the SARS-CoV-2 RBM and human ACE2
and directly contribute to the binding to human ACE2, while the L452 residue is not
on the RBM-ACE2 interface (Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020)
(Figure 2A). To directly assess the effect of these mutations in the RBM on the
binding affinity to ACE2, we prepared the yeasts expressing parental SARS-CoV-2
receptor binding domain RBD (residues 336-528) and its derivatives (L452R, Y453F

and N501Y) and performed in vitro binding assay using the yeast surface display of
the RBD and soluble ACE2 protein. Consistent with recent studies including ours
(Supasa et al., 2021; Zahradník et al., 2021b), the N501Y mutation, which is a
common mutation in the B1.1.7, B1.351 and P.1 variants [reviewed in (Plante et al.,
2021)] as well as the Y453F mutation (Bayarri-Olmos et al., 2021; Zahradník et al.,
2021b) significantly increased the binding affinity to human ACE2 (Figures 2B and
2C; RBD parental KD = 2.05 ± 0.26 nM; RBD N501Y KD = 0.59 ± 0.03 nM; and RBD
Y453F KD = 0.51 ± 0.06 nM). We also found that the L452R mutant significantly
increased the binding affinity to human ACE2 (Figures 2B and 2C; RBD L452R KD
= 1.20 ± 0.06 nM). Intriguingly, the L452R mutations increased the surface
expression, which reflects protein stability (Traxlmayr and Obinger, 2012), while the
Y453F and N501Y mutations decreased (Figure 2D).
Increase of pseudovirus infectivity by the L452R mutation
To directly analyze the effect of the mutations of interest on viral infectivity, we
prepared the HIV-1-based reporter virus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein and its mutants and the 293 cells transiently expressing human ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. As shown in Figure 2E, although the N501Y mutation faintly affected
viral infectivity in this assay, the L452R mutations significantly increased viral
infectivity compared to parental S protein. In contrast to the yeast display assay
(Figures 2B and 2C), the infectivity of the Y453F mutant was significantly lower than
that of parental S protein (Figure 2E). Altogether, these findings suggest that the
L452R substitution increases the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human
ACE2, protein stability, and viral infectivity. Although the L452 residue is not directly
located at the binding interface (Figure 2A), structural analysis and in silico
mutagenesis suggested that the L452R substitution can cause a gain of
electrostatics complementarity (Selzer et al., 2000) (Figure 2F). Because the
residue 452 is located close proximity to the negatively charged patch of ACE2
residues (E35, E37, D38), the increase of viral infectivity by the L452R substitution
can be attributed to the increase in the electrostatic interaction with ACE2.
Promotion of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures by the L452 mutation
To investigate the effect of the mutations in the RBM on viral replication, we artificially
generated the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses that harbor the mutations of
interest as well as parental recombinant virus by a reverse genetics system (Torii et
al., 2021). The nucleotide similarity of SARS-CoV-2 strain WK-521 (GISAID ID:
EPI_ISL_408667) (Matsuyama et al., 2020), the backbone of the artificially
generated recombinant SARS-CoV-2, to strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank:

NC_045512.2) (Wu et al., 2020) is 99.91% (27 nucleotides difference) and the
sequences encoding the S protein between these two strains are identical, indicating
that the strain WK-521 is a SARS-CoV-2 prototype. We verified the insertions of the
targeted mutations in the generated viruses by direct sequencing (Figure 3A) and
performed virus replication assay using these recombinant viruses. As shown in
Figure 3B, we revealed that the growth of the L452R mutant in VeroE6/TMPRSS2
cells was significantly higher than that of parental virus. Together with the findings in
the binding assay (Figures 2B-2D) and the assay using pseudoviruses (Figure 2E),
our results suggest that the L452R mutation potentially increase viral replication.
Dynamics of the spread of the RBM mutants during the current pandemic
We finally assessed the epidemic dynamics of the naturally occurring variants
containing the substitutions in L452 and Y453. As shown in Figure 4A and Table
S3, the L452R mutants were mainly found (3,967 sequences) in the B.1.427/B.1.429
lineage that forms a single clade (Deng et al., 2021). Although the L452R mutant
was first detected the B.1.39 lineage in Denmark on March 17, 2020 (GISAID ID:
EPI_ISL_429311) (Table 1), this variant did not spread. The oldest sequence that
contains the L452R mutation in the B.1.427/B.1.429 lineage was isolated in Quintana
Roo state, Mexico, on July 6, 2020 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_942929) (Table 1), and the
L452R-harboring mutants have been first detected in California state, the USA, on
September 28, 2020 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_730092 and EPI_ISL_730345) (Figure
4B). The B.1.427/B.1.429 lineage harboring the L452R mutation has started
expanding in California state, the USA, at the beginning of November, 2020 (Figure
4B, top). In 2021, this lineage has expanded throughout the USA, and currently, is
one of the most predominant lineages in the country (Figure 4B, bottom and Table
S4).
For the Y453F mutation, 1,274 out of the 1,380 mutated sequences belong
to the B.1.1.298 lineage, which has been exclusively detected in Denmark (Table
S3). The oldest sequence that contains the Y453F mutation in the B.1.1.298 lineage
was isolated from a human in Denmark on April 20, 2020 (GISAID ID:
EPI_ISL_714253) (Figure 4C). Intriguingly, the B.1.1.298 variants containing either
Y453 or F453 are detected not only in humans but also in minks (Figure 4D).
The phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequences of the B.1.1.298 lineage
SARS-CoV-2 suggested multiple SARS-CoV-2 transmissions between humans to
minks (Figure S2). Additionally, the three sequences that contain the Y453F
mutation were isolated from cats in Denmark: the two sequences out of them
(GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_683164 and EPI_ISL_683166) made a single clade, while the
other one (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_683165) had a distinct origin (Figure S2). These

results suggest that this SARS-CoV-2 variant has transmitted from humans to cats
multiple times and some of them may spread among Danish cat population. However,
the epidemic of a fraction of the B.1.1.298 lineage containing the Y453F mutation in
Denmark peaked during October to November, 2020, and subsequently, gradually
reduced (Figure 4D). The variant containing the Y453F mutation was last collected
in Denmark on January 18, 2021 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_925998) and it has not been
reported worldwide since then (Figure 4D).

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that at least two naturally occurring mutations
in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, L452R and Y453F, escape from an HLA-restricted cellular
immunity and further reinforce the affinity to viral receptor ACE2. We further
demonstrate that the L452R mutation increase the stability of S protein, viral
infectivity and thereby enhances viral replication. Our data suggests that the L452R
mutant escapes from the HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity and further
strengthens its infectivity.
Lines of recent studies have shown the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2
variants that evade the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing humoral immunity (Baum et
al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2021a; Liu
et al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2021c; McCarthy et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Weisblum
et al., 2020) and have alerted the risk of the spread of immune escape variants. In
addition to humoral immunity, Zuo et al. have recently reported that functional SARSCoV-2-specific cellular immune responses are retained at least 6 months following
infection (Zuo et al., 2021). Le Bert et al. have also shown that functional cellular
immune responses can contribute to controlling the disease progression of COVID19 (Le Bert et al., 2021). These observations suggest the importance of cellular
immunity eliciting efficient antiviral effects. However, the possibility of the emergence
of SARS-CoV-2 variants that can evade cellular immunity has not been addressed
yet. Here we demonstrated the L452R and Y453F mutations can contribute to
escaping from an HLA-restricted cellular immunity. In addition to our findings, recent
papers have documented that the L452R (Deng et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020) and
Y453F substitutions (Baum et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2021b) are potentially
resistant to neutralization antibodies, suggesting that these mutants can evade both
humoral and an HLA-restricted cellular immunity. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that the L452R mutation significantly improve the viral replication capacity by
increasing the binding affinity to human ACE2 and protein stability. Altogether, our
findings suggest that the emergence of the variants that can escape from the HLArestricted cellular immunity and further enhance viral replication capacity is another
potential risk for deteriorating the COVID-19 pandemic situation.
As suggested in previous reports (Koopmans, 2021; Oude Munnink et al.,
2021; WHO, 2020b), our data showed that the B.1.1.298 variant possessing the
Y453F substitution is closely associated with the outbreak in minks in Denmark.
Although it remains unclear whether the emergence of the Y453F mutant potentially
associates with the evasion from the acquired immunity in mink, here we showed
that this mutation can be resistant to the HLA-A24-resticted human cellular immunity.
Because the Y453F mutation did not increase the infection efficacy using mink ACE2,

our results suggest that the emergence of this mutant is not due to improving viral
fitness to mink. Nevertheless, the host range of SARS-CoV-2, in terms of the use of
ACE2 molecule for infection receptor, is broad in a variety of mammals (Liu et al.,
2021a; OIE, 2021). More importantly, although murine ACE2 cannot be used for the
infection of prototype SARS-CoV-2, recent studies have revealed that some SARSCoV-2 variants including the B.1.351 and P.1 variants gained the ability to use
murine ACE2 for infection and expanded their host range to mice (Li et al., 2021;
Montagutelli et al., 2021). In addition to the evasion from human acquired immunity,
zoonotic and zooanthroponosis SARS-CoV-2 transmissions can contribute to the
accumulation of mutations in the spreading viruses and further impact viral
phenotypes including infectivity, replication efficacy, pathogenicity, transmissibility
and even host range. Therefore, the surveillance on the emergence of novel variants
even in nonhuman mammals and assessing their potentials to adapt to use
nonhuman ACE2 for infection receptor will be critical.
In contrast to the B.1.1.298 variant, the B.1.427/429 variant that harbors
L452R substitution seem to emerge during the spread in human population,
particularly in the California state in the USA, one of the hot spots of the SARS-CoV2 outbreak in the USA [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu (as of April 2, 2021)]. Because
the L452R mutation reinforces the binding affinity to human ACE2 and further
enhances viral replication capacity, this variant might have emerged to improve viral
fitness in humans. Another possibility is that the L452R mutant has emerged to
evade the HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity: HLA-A24 is relatively predominant
in East Asian individuals (Gonzalez-Galarza et al., 2020), and the proportion of Asian
American in California is highest in the USA (CDC, 2019). For instance, the
proportion of the HLA-A24-positive individuals is ~20% in San Diego (Moore et al.,
2018), a city of California, where more than 270,000 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases
reported so far [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu (as of April 2, 2021)]. Therefore, it might
be conceivable to assume that the emergence of the L452R mutant (or the
B.1.427/429 lineage) was driven by the HLA-A24-mediated cellular immunity.
In addition to the escape from antiviral acquired immunity, recent studies
have shown that the emerging variants during the current pandemic, particularly the
B.1.1.7 variant, can even increase viral pathogenicity and the mortality of COVID-19
(Challen et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021; Grint et al., 2021). Importantly, the HLAA24 individuals are relatively highly frequent in East and Southeast Asian countries,
such as Japan (Japanese, allele frequency=0.364, n=1,550) and Malaysia
(Malaysian, allele frequency=0.361, n=1,974) (Gonzalez-Galarza et al., 2020)
(Table S1), where both the confirmed cases and the mortality of COVID-19 are
relatively lower than European countries and the USA so far

[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu (as of April 2, 2021)]. A limitation of this study is that the
effects of the L452 and Y453 substitutions on viral pathogenicity, mortality and
transmissibility remain unaddressed. To fully characterize the virological features of
these mutants, further investigations using animal models and epidemiological data
will be required. Nevertheless, here we showed direct evidence suggesting that the
mutations in the RBM including L452R (in the B.1.427/429 lineage) and Y453F (in
the B1.1.298 lineage) potentially escape from the HLA-A24-resticted cellular
immunity, and further, the L452R mutant increase its replication capacity. Therefore,
these variants, particularly those possessing the L452R mutations, such as the
B.1.427/429 lineage, can be the potential threat for these countries and regions with
predominant HLA-A24 individuals, and deep surveillance and tracing the epidemic
of these variants will be urgently required.

(H and I) Mutations escaped from the HLA-A24-restricted NF9-specific CTLs. The
HLA-A*24:02-positive CTL lines of 5 COVID-19 convalescents were stimulated with
1 nM NF9 peptide or its derivatives: NF9-L452R (NYNYRYRLF) and NF9-Y453F
(NYNYLFRLF). Representative FACS plots showing the intracellular expression of
IFN-γ in the CD8+ T cell subset of a COVID-19 convalescent (donor #1) (H) and the
mean of the percentage of IFN-γ+ cells in CD8+ T cells (I) are shown.
In A, E and H, the numbers in the FACS plot represent the percentage of gated cells
in CD8+ T cells. In C, the number represents the percentage of the cells in each
quadrant.
In B, a statistically significant difference (*, P<0.05) between SARS-CoV-2
seronegative and COVID-19 convalescent samples is determined by Mann-Whitney
U test, and a statistically significant difference (*, P<0.05) between with and without
NF9 peptide in COVID-19 convalescent samples is determined by Wilcoxon signedrank test.
In F, each symbol of the COVID-19 convalescent data represents the mean of
technical triplicate. Statistically significant differences (*, P<0.05) between with and
without NF9 peptide in COVID-19 convalescent samples are determined by
Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
In I, the assay was performed in triplicate, and the means are shown with SD.
Statistically significant differences (*, P<0.05) versus "no are determined by ANOVA
with multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Ethics Statement
All protocols involving the human subjects recruiting at Kyushu University Hospital,
Japan, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Japan, and Tokyo
Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Japan,
were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee for Epidemiological and
General Research at the Faculty of Life Science, Kumamoto University (approval
numbers 2066 and 461). All human subjects provided written informed consent.
Cell Culture
Human PBMCs were obtained from a total of 15 subjects harboring HLA-A*24:02
including 12 COVID-19 convalescents and 3 seronegatives (Table S5). The PBMCs
were purified by a density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, cat# 17-1440-03) and stored in liquid nitrogen until further
use. The C1R cells expressing HLA-A*2402 (C1R-A2402) (Karaki et al., 1993) were
maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 11875101)
containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and
streptomycin; PS).
HEK293 cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line; ATCC CRL-1573) and HEK293T
cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line; ATCC CRL-3216) were maintained in

METHOD DETAILS
Viral Genomes and Phylogenetic Analyses
All viral genome sequences and annotation information used in this study were
downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) as of March 15, 2021 (750,243
sequences). We used the viral nucleotide sequences that do not contain any
undetermined nucleotides in the region coding S protein for the analysis (581,367
sequences). The SARS-CoV-2 variants containing the L452R or Y453F mutation
were sorted from the verified 581,367 sequences (Tables S2 and S3). To infer the
phylogeny of B.1.1.298 lineage (Figure S2), we collected the 657 sequences
belonging to the B.1.1.298 lineage that do not contain any undetermined nucleotides.
We aligned whole genome sequences by using FFT-NS-2 program in an MAFFT
suite v7.467 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and removed gapped regions using trimAl
v1.4.rev22 with a gappyout option (Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009). We selected
GTR+I as the best-fit nucleotide substitution model using ModelTest-NG v0.1.5
(Darriba et al., 2020). Using the model, we generated a maximum-likelihood based
phylogenetic tree using RAxML-NG v1.0.0 (Kozlov et al., 2019) with a bootstrap test
(n=100).
Activation Induced Marker Assay
The expansion of antigen-specific human CD8+ T cells and the analysis of the
surface expression levels of activation markers, CD25 and CD137, were performed

as previously described (Wolfl et al., 2007). Briefly, human PBMCs were pulsed with
1 μg/ml of the SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator peptide pools (“S overlap peptides”) (Miltenyi
Biotec, cat# 130-126-700) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, cat# 11875101) containing 10% FCS and 30 U/ml recombinant human IL2 (Peprotec, cat# 200-02) for 10-14 days. The in vitro expanded CD8+ T cells (i.e.,
the CTL lines) were stimulated with or without the NF9 peptide (NYNYLYRLF,
residues 448-456 of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein; synthesized by Scrum Inc.). After
the incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the cells were washed and the surface proteins (CD3,
CD8, CD14, CD19, CD25 and CD137) were stained with the antibodies listed in Key
Resources Table. The dead cells were stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D
(Biolegend, cat# 420404). After the incubation for 20 min on ice, the cells were fixed
with 1% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, cat# 09154-85) and the levels of protein
surface expression were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS Canto II (BD
Biosciences). The data obtained by flow cytometry were analyzed by FlowJo
software (Tree Star).
Analysis of Multifunctionality and Cytotoxic Potential of CD8+ T cells
C1R-A2402 cells were pulsed with or without the NF9 peptide or its derivatives [the
NF9-L452R peptide (NYNYRYRLF, L5R in NF9) and the NF9-Y453F peptide
(NYNYLFRLF, Y6F in NF9); synthesized by Scrum Inc.] at concentrations from 0.1
to 10 nM at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS, mixed with the CTL
lines generated from COVID-19 convalescents (see above) and incubated with
RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 11875101) containing 10% FCS,
5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# B7651), 2 μM monensin (Biolegend, cat#
420701) and BV421-anti-CD107a antibody (Biolegend, cat# 420404) in a 96-well U
plate at 37°C for 5 h. Then, the cells were washed and the surface proteins (CD3,
CD8, CD14 and CD19) were stained with the antibodies listed in Key Resources
Table. The dead cells were stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (Biolegend, cat#
420404). After the incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the cells were fixed and
permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization solution kit (BD
Biosciences, cat# 554714) and the intracellular proteins (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2)
were stained with the antibodies listed in Key Resources Table. After the incubation
at room temperature for 30 min, the cells were washed and the levels of protein
expression were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS Canto II (BD
Biosciences). The data obtained by flow cytometry were analyzed by FlowJo
software (Tree Star).

The plasmids expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (pCAGGS-SARS2-S) and its
mutants (pCAGGS-S-L452R, pCAGGS-SARS2-S-Y453F and pCAGGS-SARS2-SN501Y) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis PCR using pC-SARS2-S
(kindly provided by Kenzo Tokunaga) (Ozono et al., 2021) as the template and the
following primers: S forward, 5'-TTG GGTACC ATG TTT GTG TTC CTG GTG CTG3'; S reverse, 5'-GTG GCGGCCGC TCT AGA TTC AGG TGT AGT GCA GTT T-3';
S Y453F forward, 5'-GTG GGA GGC AAC TAC AAC TAC CTC TTC AGA-3'; and S

5'-TCC TAT GGC TTC CAA CCA ACC TAT GGA-3'; and S N501Y reverse, 5'-TGG
TTG GAA GCC ATA GGA TTG-3'. The resultant PCR fragment was digested with
KpnI and NotI and inserted into the KpnI-NotI site of pCAGGS vector (Niwa et al.,
1991).
To construct the expression plasmid for human ACE2 (GenBank:
NM_021804.3) (pLV-EF1a-human ACE2-IRES-Puro), the MluI-SmaI fragment
pTargeT-human ACE2 (kindly provided by Shuetsu Fukushi) (Fukushi et al., 2007)
was inserted into the MluI-HpaI site of pLV-EF1a-IRES-Puro (Addgene #85132).
Nucleotide sequences were determined by a DNA sequencing service (Fasmac),
and the sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher v5.1 software (Gene Codes
Corporation).
Preparation of Soluble Human ACE2
To prepare soluble human ACE2, the expression plasmid for the extracellular
domain of human ACE2 (residues 18-740) based on pHL-sec (Addgene, cat# 99845)
(Zahradník et al., 2021a) was transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine
293 transfection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# A14525) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Three days posttransfection, the culture medium was
harvested, centrifuged, and filtrated through a 0.45-µm pore size filter (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, cat# 09-740-114). The filtered medium was applied on a 5-ml of
HisTrap Fast Flow column (Cytiva, cat# 17-5255-01) equilibrated by phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) using ÄKTA pure chromatography system (Cytiva). The
column was washed with PBS and the pure human ACE2 protein (residues 18-740)
was eluted using the PBS supplemented with 300 mM imidazole (pH 7.4). Using
Ultracel-3 regenerated cellulose membrane (Merck, cat# UFC900324), the buffer
was exchanged to PBS and the purified protein was concentrated. The purity of
prepared protein was analyzed by a Tycho NT.6 system (NanoTemper).

A labeling-free yeast surface display plasmid pJYDC1 (Addgene, cat# 162458)
(Zahradník et al., 2021b) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD (residues 336-528)
(pJYDC1-RBD) (Zahradník et al., 2021a) was modified by the restriction enzymefree cloning procedure (Peleg and Unger, 2014). To prepare the plasmids with the
mutated RBD, megaprimers were amplified by PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart
ReadyMix kit (Roche, cat# KK2601) and the following primers: RBD L452R forward
5'-GGA CAG CAA GGT GGG AGG CAA CTA CAA CTA CAG ATA CAG ACT GTT

AGT AT-3', according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR products were
integrated into pJYDC1 by integration PCR as previously described (Peleg and
Unger, 2014).
Analysis of the Binding Affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD Variants to Human
ACE2 by Yeast Surface Display
The pJYDC1-based yeast display plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 RBD and its
mutants were transformed into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; strain EBY100,
ATCC MYA-4941) and selected by the growth on the SD-W plates (Peleg and Unger,
2014). Single colonies were grown in 1-ml liquid SD-CAA medium (Zahradník et al.,
2021a) overnight at 30°C (220 rpm) and used to inoculate the expression cultures in
the 1/9 medium (Zahradník et al., 2021a) with 1 nM bilirubin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#
14370-1G). The cells were washed with PBS-B buffer [PBS supplemented with
bovine serum albumin (1 g/l)] and aliquoted in analysis solutions. The analysis
solutions consist of the PBS-B buffer with the 14 different concentrations (covering
the range from 100 nM to 1 pM) of the human ACE2 protein (residues 18-740) that
is labeled with CF640R succinimidyl ester (Biotium, cat# 92108). The volume of the
analysis solution was adjusted (1-100 ml) in order to reduce the effect of ligand
depletion (Zahradník et al., 2021b). The yeasts expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S RBDs
were incubated with the analysis solution overnight to allow for equilibrium.
Subsequently, the yeasts were washed with the PBS-B buffer, passed through a 40µm cell strainer (SPL Life Sciences, cat# 93040), and the binding affinity to the
CF640R-labeled human ACE2 protein (residues 18-740) was analyzed using an
Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The fluorescent signal was processed
as previously described (Zahradník et al., 2021b) and the standard non-cooperative

(https://www.python.org).
Pseudovirus Assay
To prepare the pseudoviruses, the lentivirus (HIV)-based, luciferase-expressing
reporter viruses that are pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its
derivatives, HEK293T cells (1 × 106 cells) were cotransfected with 1 μg of psPAX2IN/HiBiT (Ozono et al., 2020), and 1 μg of pWPI-Luc2 (Ozono et al., 2020), and 500
ng of the plasmids expressing parental S or its derivatives (L452R, Y453F or N501Y)
using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# L3000015) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Two days posttransfection, the culture supernatants
were harvested, centrifuged, and treated with 37.5 U/ml DNase I (Roche, cat#
Sigma-Aldrich, cat# 11284932001) at 37°C for 30 min. The amount of the
pseudoviruses prepared was quantified by HiBiT assay and the measured value was
normalized to the level of HIV p24 antigen as previously described (Ozono et al.,
2021; Ozono et al., 2020). The pseudoviruses prepared were stored at –80°C until
use.
To prepare the target cells for pseudovirus infection, HEK293T cells (1 ×
6
10 cells) were cotransfected with 250 ng of pC-TMPRSS2 (Ozono et al., 2021) and
500 ng of pC-ACE2 (a human ACE2 expression plasmid) (Ozono et al., 2021) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 11668019) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Two days posttransfection, the transfected cells (22,000
cells/100 μl) were seeded into 96-well plates and infected with 100 μl of the
pseudoviruses prepared at 4 different doses (1, 3, 5 and 10 ng of p24 antigen). Two
days postinfection, the infected cells were lysed with One-Glo luciferase assay
system (Promega, cat# E6130), and the luminescent signal was measured by using
a CentroXS3 plate reader (Berthhold Technologies).
Lentiviral Transduction
Lentiviral transduction was performed as described previously (Anderson et al.,
2018; Ikeda et al., 2019). Briefly, the VSV-G-pseudotyped lenvirus vector expressing
human ACE2 was generated by transfecting 2.5 μg of pLV-EF1a-human ACE2IRES-Puro plasmid with 1.67 μg of pΔ-NRF (expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, rev, and tat
genes) (Naldini et al., 1996) and 0.83 μg of pVSV-G (expressing VSV-G; Addgene,
cat#138479) into 293T cells (3 × 106 cells) using TransIT-LT1 (Takara, cat#
MIR2300) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days posttransfection, the
culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged, and the supernatants were filtered
with 0.45 µm pore size filter (Millipore, cat# SLGVR33RB) and collected as the

lentiviral vector. The lenvirus vectors were concentrated by centrifugation (at 22,000
× g for 2 h at 4°C) and the concentrated lentiviral vectors were inoculated into the
target cells and incubated at 37°C. Two days posttransduction, the transduced cells
were placed under the drug selection using the culture medium containing 1 µg/ml
puromycin (Invivogen, cat# ant-pr-1). The puromycin-selected cells with relatively
higher ACE2 expression were sorted by a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) and
expanded. After the expansion, the expression level of surface ACE2 was verified
by a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences). For the staining of surface ACE2, a goat antiACE2 polyclonal antibody (R&D systems, cat# AF933) and an APC-conjugated
donkey anti-goat IgG (R&D systems, cat# F0108) were used. A normal goat IgG
(R&D systems, cat# AB-108-C) was used as the negative control of this assay.
Protein Structure
The 3D visualization of the SARS-CoV-2 S and human ACE2 proteins (Figures 2A
and 2F) was generated using PyMOL v2.3 (https://pymol.org/2/) with the cocrystal
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S and human ACE2 proteins (PDB: 6M17) (Yan et al.,
2020). The L452R substitution (Figure 2F) was prepared using UCSF Chimera
v1.13 (Pettersen et al., 2004).
SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Genetics
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 was generated by circular polymerase extension
reaction (CPER) as previously described (Torii et al., 2021). In brief, the 9 DNA
fragments encoding the partial genome of SARS-CoV-2 (strain WK-521; GISAID ID:
EPI_ISL_408667) (Matsuyama et al., 2020) were prepared by PCR using
PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara, cat# R050A). Additionally, a linker
fragment encoding hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVr), bovine growth hormone
(BGH) polyA signal and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was prepared by PCR.
The corresponding SARS-CoV-2 genomic region and the templates and the primers
of this PCR are summarized in Table S6. The obtained 10 DNA fragments were
mixed and used for the CPER (Torii et al., 2021).
To produce the recombinant SARS-CoV-2, the CPER products were
transfected into HEK293-C34 cells using TransIT-LT1 (Takara, cat# MIR2300)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. One day posttransfection, the culture
medium was replaced with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium (high glucose)
(Sigma-Aldrich, cat# R8758-500ML) containing 2% FCS, 1% PS and doxycycline (1
μg/ml; Takara, cat# 1311N). Six days posttransfection, the culture medium was
harvested, centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected as the seed virus. To
remove the CPER products (i.e., SARS-CoV-2-related DNA), 1 ml of the seed virus

incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The complete removal of the CPER products (i.e., SARSCoV-2-related DNA) from the seed virus was verified by PCR. To prepare the
working virus of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 for the virological experiments
(Figure 3), 100 μl of the seed virus was inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells
(5,000,000 cells in T-75 flask). One hour after infection, the culture medium was
replaced with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) (Wako, cat# 04129775) containing 2% FCS and 1% PS. Two days postinfection, the culture medium
was harvested, centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected as the working
virus.
To generate the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 mutants, mutations were

sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher version 5.1 software (Gene Codes
Corporation). The CPER for the preparation of SARS-CoV-2 mutants was performed
using the mutated fragment 8 instead of the parental fragment 8. Subsequent
experimental procedures correspond to the procedure for parental SARS-CoV-2
preparation (described above). To verify the inserted mutation in the working viruses,
viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, cat# 52906). Viral
RNA was reversed transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, cat# 18080085) according to manufacturers' protocols. The DNA
fragments including the mutations inserted were obtained by RT-PCR using
PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara, cat# R050A) and the following primers:
WK-521 22607-22630 forward: 5'-GCA TCT GTT TAT GCT TGG AAC AGG-3'; and
WK-521 23342-23367 reverse: 5'-CCT GGT GTT ATA ACA CTG ACA CCA CC-3'.

chromatograms (Figure 3A) were visualized using a web application Tracy
(https://www.gear-genomics.com/teal/) (Rausch et al., 2020).
Plaque Assay
One day prior to infection, 200,000 Vero cells were seeded into the 12-well plate.
The virus was diluted with serum-free virus dilution buffer [1 × minimum essential
medium (Temin's modification) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# 11935046) with 20
mM Hepes, non-essential amino acid (Thermo Fisher Scientifc, cat# 11140-050) and
antibiotics]. After removing the culture media, Vero cells were infected with 500 µl of
the diluted virus at 37 °C. Two hours postinfection, 1 ml of mounting solution [1 ×
minimum essential medium containing 3% FCS and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose
(Sigma, cat# C9481-500G)] was overlaid and incubated at 37 °C. Three days
postinfection, the culture media were removed, and the cells were washed with PBS
three times and fixed with 10% formaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, cat# 37152-51) or
4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, cat# 09154-85). The fixed cells were
washed with city water, dried up, and stained with staining solution [2% crystal violet
(Nacalai Tesque, cat# 09804-52) or 0.1% methylene blue (Nacalai Tesque, cat#
22412-14) in water]. The stained cells were washed with city water, dried up, and
the number of plaques was counted to calculate plaque forming unit (pfu).
SARS-CoV-2 Infection
One day prior to infection, 10,000 cells of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and 293-ACE2 cells
were seeded into the 96-well plate. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (100 pfu) was
inoculated and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The infected cells were washed and
replaced with 180 µl of culture media. The culture supernatant (10 µl) was harvested
at 0, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours postinfection and used for real-time PCR to quantify the
copy number of viral RNA.
Real-time RT-PCR
The amount of viral RNA in the culture supernatant was quantified by real-time RTPCR as previously described (Shema Mugisha et al., 2020) with some modifications.
In brief, 5 μl of culture supernatants was mixed with 5 μl of 2 × RNA lysis buffer [2%
Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40% glycerol, 0.8 U/μl
recombinant RNase inhibitor (Takara, cat# 2313B)] and incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. RNase-free water (90 μl) was added and the diluted sample
(2.5 μl) was used as the template of real-time RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR was
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the One Step TB Green
PrimeScript PLUS RT-PCR kit (Takara, cat# RR096A) and the following primers:

signal was acquired on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR systems (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad) or a 7500
Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
