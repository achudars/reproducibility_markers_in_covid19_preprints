Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has
motivated a widespread effort to understand its epidemiology and pathogenic
mechanisms. Modern high-throughput sequencing technology has led to the deposition
of vast numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in curated repositories, which have
been useful in mapping the spread of the virus around the globe. They also provide a
unique opportunity to observe virus evolution in real time. Here, we evaluate two cohorts
of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify rapidly emerging variants within
structured cis-regulatory elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, twenty variants
are present at a minor allele frequency of at least 0.5%. Several enhance the stability of
Stem Loop 1 in the 5´UTR, including a set of co-occurring variants that extend its length.
One appears to modulate the stability of the frameshifting pseudoknot between ORF1a
and ORF1b, and another perturbs a bi-stable molecular switch in the 3´UTR. Finally, five
variants destabilize structured elements within the 3´UTR hypervariable region, including
the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in
viral replication. Two of the most abundant variants appear to be caused by RNA editing,
suggesting host-viral defense contributes to SARS-CoV-2 genome heterogeneity. This
analysis has implications for the development of therapeutics that target viral cisregulatory RNA structures or sequences, as rapidly emerging variations in these regions
could lead to drug resistance.

Introduction
The betacoronaviridae are non-segmented single-stranded positive sense
viruses with an RNA genome of approximately thirty kilobases in length. This family
poses a significant threat to human health. In addition to causing approximately 30% of
annual upper respiratory infections (Stadler et al. 2003; Su et al. 2016), it is responsible
for three major outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, MERS, and
COVID-19) since the turn of the century (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Zhong
et al. 2003; Zaki et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2020). COVID-19 is a unique form of
pneumonia characterized by high fever, dry cough, and occasionally catastrophic
hypoxia. It was first described in the city of Wuhan, Huibei Province, in the fall of 2019
(Chan et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020). A novel virus termed severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of this
disease (Wang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020). The rapid spread of the virus led to a global
pandemic that caused significant morbidity and mortality and disruption of daily life for
millions of people. The extraordinary impact of this virus fueled strong interest in
understanding its pathophysiology and epidemiology with the hope of developing new
treatments and approaches to limit its spread.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle is similar to that of other betacoronaviridae
(Zheng 2020). Following attachment of the virus to the host cell and membrane fusion,
viral genomic RNA is introduced to the host cell where it is translated to produce a
polyprotein encoding the viral replicase, proteases, and several accessory proteins. The
replicase is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that produces full-length antigenomic
sequence that serves as a template for the production of additional copies of the viral
genome and several nested subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) that encode the structural
components of the virion.

Conserved stem loop structures are present in both coding and noncoding
regions the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome (Ramya Rangan 2020). They cluster in the
5´UTR, the N-terminal portion of ORF-1a, at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, and in
the 3´UTR. While their precise role is not known, their function can be inferred from
studies of related elements in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and other coronaviridae
(Yang and Leibowitz 2015; Madhugiri et al. 2016). The structured elements have
regulatory roles in various aspects of viral replication, sgRNA synthesis, and translation.
Though they are divergent in sequence, the structures appear to be conserved, and in
some cases elements from SARS-CoV can functionally substitute for those in MHV with
little impact on viral replication. (Goebel et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2006a; Kang et al.
2006b; Zust et al. 2008; Chen and Olsthoorn 2010; Yang and Leibowitz 2015).
DNA sequencing technology has progressed remarkably since the SARS
outbreak of 2003 (Geoghegan and Holmes 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). It is now routine to
determine the sequence of the ~30 kilobase viral genome using high throughput
sequencing technology (Wu et al. 2020). As a result, scientists and medical
professionals from around world have sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome from patient
isolates and disseminated their findings through data repositories (e.g. the GISAID
EpiCoV database) at unprecedented speed (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and
McCauley 2017; Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on
Taxonomy of 2020; Wu et al. 2020). This has enabled the construction of molecular
phylogenies that have guided our understanding of the virus transmission history, its
basal mutation rate, and its potential to evade emerging therapeutics and vaccines
(Bedford et al. 2020; Chu et al. 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020b; Lv et al.
2020; Pachetti et al. 2020; Pinto et al. 2020). At the time of this writing, almost 25,000
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been deposited in the GISAID EpiCoV database
(www.gisaid.org) and are available through a database access agreement (Elbe and

Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley 2017). Over 3500 SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequences have been deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) Genbank (ncbi.nih.nlv.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs) and are freely available to
the public.
Here, we analyzed both cohorts to identify and characterize rapidly emerging
variations within the cis-regulatory RNA structures of the virus genome. Our analysis
reveals twenty rapidly emerging variants including two that likely arose through RNA
editing. The data identify SL1 of the 5´UTR as a hot spot for viral mutation, where most
mutations stabilize the stem loop structure. The data also show that structured elements
in the 3´UTR hypervariable region, including the enigmatic S2M loop, contain rapidly
emerging variations predicted to be destabilizing. The results provide insight into the
relevance of the proposed viral RNA structures, and present a roadmap to avoid
potential confounds to RNA therapeutic development.

Results
Identification of rapidly emerging variants in structured regions of the SARS-CoV-2
genome
The genome sequence for viral isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Genbank MN908947) was
used as a reference genome (Wu et al. 2020). The 5´UTR (1–265), the structured region
of ORF1a (266–450), the frameshifting pseudoknot (13,457–13,546), or the 3´UTR
(29,543–29,903) were used as queries in a BLASTn search of the NCBI Betacoronavirus
database filtered for SARS-CoV-2 (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2009). An
average of 3600 ± 160 hits were recovered from each query. The sequences recovered
from BLASTn were aligned with MAFFT using the FFT-NS-2 algorithm to produce a
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) (Katoh et al. 2002). The MSA was then input into
WebLogo 3 to calculate the positional occupancy, entropy, and allele frequency for each

query (Supplementary Table 1) (Crooks et al. 2004). The occupancy defines the number
of A, C, G, or U bases observed at each position (denoted as weight in the WebLogo3
output), the entropy defines the positional information content (lower value equals more
variation), and the allele frequency defines the fractional occupancy of each nucleotide
at each position. The results reveal high occupancy (>90%) from position 57 of the
5´UTR through position 29,836 of the 3´UTR, but the occupancy drops off significantly
near the 5´ and 3´ ends of the genome (Fig. 1A), dipping below 20%. This is presumably
due to difficulty of capturing the ends of the genome in sequencing library production.
Nevertheless, even the extreme termini have coverage of more than 300 genomes. The
positional entropy scores identify multiple variations in both low and high occupancy
regions suggesting that variant entropy is not overly skewed by the terminal deficiencies
in the genomic sequencing data. In total, fourteen variants with a minor allele frequency
(MAF) of greater than 0.005 (0.5%) were identified by this approach.
To extend this analysis, we repeated the study with a second cohort of SARSCoV-2 sequences recovered from the GISAID database on May 13, 2020 (Elbe and
Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley 2017). All sequences were downloaded from
the database, converted into a blast library, then queried and analyzed as above with the
NCBI cohort. An average of 23,900 ± 630 hits were recovered from each query. As with
the NCBI cohort, occupancy is high (>90%) from position 55 through position 29,829
(Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table 1). Due to the large size of the GISAID cohort—6.6 times
the size of the NCBI cohort—the termini are covered by thousands of genomes despite
the relatively low occupancy. In total, seventeen variants with a MAF of at least 0.005
were identified in the GISAID cohort, eleven of which were also identified in the NCBI
cohort (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table 2). Combining the two analyses yields a total of
twenty rapidly emerging variants in the structured regions of the viral genome. Of these,
thirteen are transversions and seven are transitions. Eighteen are in noncoding regions

(2.9%, 18/602 positions evaluated), and the remaining two are silent mutations within the
coding sequence of ORF1a or ORF1b (0.7%, 2/275 positions evaluated). Considering
the larger GISAID cohort, there are 80 invariant residues (30.1%) in the 5´UTR, 90
(48.9%) in the ORF1a structured region, 58 (64.4%) in the frameshifting pseudoknot,
and 131 (38.9%) in the 3´UTR. Thus, as expected, structures in the coding region seem
to show a higher degree of conservation and fewer rapidly emerging alleles than noncoding regions, presumably due to the selective pressure of maintaining the protein
coding sequence.

Variations in SL1 through SL4 of the 5´UTR
In MHV, stem loop 1 (SL1) plays a critical role in virus replication and is proposed
to form long-range interactions with the 3´UTR (Zuniga et al. 2004; Li et al. 2008). Stem
Loop 2 (SL2) contains a highly conserved sequence and structural elements thought to
play a role in sgRNA synthesis (Liu et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009; Chen and Olsthoorn
2010; Lee et al. 2011). The structure of Stem loop 3 (SL3) is less well conserved, but it
contains the leftmost transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L) required for template
switching in sgRNA production (Zuniga et al. 2004; Sola et al. 2005; Yang and Leibowitz
2015). Stem loop 4 (SL4) contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that could
reduce translation initiation at the ORF1a start codon and/or act as a spacer between 5´
structured elements and ORF1a (Raman et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2014).
The precise role of these structures in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known, but recently
released structural predictions reveal all four stem loops are present in the SARS-CoV-2
genome (Fig. 2) (Ramya Rangan 2020).
SL1 and flanking single-stranded regions contain nine of the twenty variants
identified in this analysis. In contrast, no rapidly emerging variants (MAF >0.005) are
found in SL2 through SL4. To determine how the variations in SL1 influence the

secondary structure, we used RNAfold to calculate the most favored energy structure for
each variant (Fig. 2D-E) (Lorenz et al. 2011). U2A (A=0.006/2519 GISAID, A=0.014/419
NCBI) and A4U (U=0.004/1799 GISAID, U=0.016/419 NCBI) have no influence on the
stability of SL1 (ΔG=–8.50 kcal/mol for reference and both variants). U11G
(G=0.001/4154 GISAID, G= 0.006/772 NCBI) had a small effect on the predicted stability
(ΔG=–8.40 kcal/molU11G) due to loss of a stem terminal A-U pair. The A12U variant
(U=0.002/4484 GISAID, U=0.011/829 NCBI) stabilized the predicted structure through
formation of an additional base pair (ΔG=–10.2 kcal/molA12U). By contrast, A31U
(U=0.005/7525 GISAID, U=0.029/1314 NCBI) is strongly destabilizing (ΔG=–5.40
kcal/mol), causing disruption of the lower stem.
Four rapidly emerging variations are found just downstream of the SL1 stem (Fig.
2A). A34U (U=0.009/7795 GISAID, U= 0.050/1350 NCBI), A35U (U=0.013/7846 GISAID,
U=0.071/1380 NCBI), C36U (U=0.028/7967 GISAID, U=0.150/1400 NCBI) and C37A
(A=0.003/8091 GISAID, A=0.018/1474 NCBI) variants frequently occur in combination.
In the most common combination, three of the four positions (A34A35C36C37) are
simultaneously replaced (U34U35U36C37). This variant has an allele frequency of
UUUC=0.004/7795 (GISAID) and UUUC=0.023/1350 (NCBI). The variation extends the
lower stem of SL1 by three base pairs, stabilizing the duplex by 2.4 kcal/mol (ΔG=–10.9
kcal/mol) (Fig. 2E). The second most frequent combination (U34U35U36A37) is present at
an allele frequency of UUUA=0.003/7795 (GISAID) and UUUA=0.018/1350 (NCBI). This
variant extends the SL1 lower stem by yet another base pair, increasing its overall
stability by 3.4 kcal/mol (ΔG=–11.9 kcal/mol). Of these four positions, only C36U
frequently exists as a single variation (U=0.013/7967 GISAID, 0.071/1400 NCBI).
RNAfold analysis reveals no change in the stem loop structure or stability for the C36U
variant.

Both combination variations are only found in samples sequenced from the
United States, with the majority of them coming from the state of Washington. To better
assess the relatedness between genomes containing U34U35U36C37 and U34U35U36A37
variants, we recovered the entire genomes of each example containing either extended
SL1 stem variation from the GISAID cohort and aligned them using MAFFT (Katoh et al.
2002). The reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1) was used as an outgroup. A radial maximal
likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated using the Tamura-Nei model in MEGAX, and
the results plotted (Supp. Fig. 1) (Tamura and Nei 1993; Stecher et al. 2020). The
phylogenetic relationship shows that both variants are represented in two different
branches, but the variants tend to cluster separately within those branches. In one case,
thirteen U34U35U36A37 genomes cluster within a node that is otherwise occupied
U34U35U36C37, suggesting that U34U35U36 variation arose first, and A37 arose as a
secondary mutation. The impact of these variations on viral fitness or patient outcomes
is not known.
Most of the rapidly emerging variants in SL1 enhance the stem loop structure.
This suggests that SL1 stabilization is not overly deleterious to virus replication. In MHV,
by contrast, destabilizing mutations of the lower stem are well tolerated in a cell model of
virus replication, but mutations that increase the stability the lower stem block replication
(Li et al. 2008). It is important to note that there is significant sequence divergence in this
region between the two viruses that may explain this apparent dichotomy. Interestingly,
the combination U34U35U36C37 variation co-occurs with the destabilizing A31U mutation
48.5% of the time, suggesting a potential compensatory role. Consistent with this
hypothesis, the extension in SL1 rescues the destabilizing A31U variation by 2.1
kcal/mol (ΔG=–7.5kcal/mol). However, we note that none of the combination
U34U35U36A37 variant genomes harbor A31U, so it is clear that the SL1 extension can
exist in the absence of a compensatory destabilizing mutation. There are no rapidly

emerging variations within the upper stem or the loop of SL1, suggesting this region
could be important to infection. Consistent with that hypothesis, mutations that
destabilize the upper stem of MHV SL1 block virus replication (Li et al. 2008).

Variations in SL5 through SL10 at the 5´UTR/ORF1a junction
A large branched helical structure termed Stem Loop 5 is predicted to form at the
interface between the 5´UTR and the N-terminal region of ORF1a (Fig. 2B) (Ramya
Rangan 2020). This region contains three stems (SL5a, SL5b, and SL5c) connected by
a helical junction. There is considerable sequence divergence among the coronaviridae
in this structure, but the overall fold is largely preserved (Chen and Olsthoorn 2010). In
SARS-CoV-2, the SL5a stem occludes the initiation codon for ORF1a, suggesting this
structure must open prior to translation initiation. However, the SL5a stem is essential for
virus replication in a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) model (Brown et al. 2007). The role of
SL5c is more controversial, with one study demonstrating that the stem is dispensable
(Yang and Leibowitz 2015), while a previous study showed that it is required (Brown et
al. 2007).
We observed two rapidly emerging variants within the SL5 structured region with
a minor allele frequency of greater than 0.005. The first, A187C (C=0.007/23832
GISAID, C=0.003/3407 NCBI), occurs within a bulged nucleotide of SL5a and is
therefore not expected to alter the structure. The second, C241U (U=0.682/23760
GISAID, U=0.616/3376 NCBI) is in SL5b loop and is the most abundant rapidly
emerging variant by far. There are no rapidly emerging mutations with an allele
frequency of >0.005 in SL5c in either cohort.
Four additional stem loop structures (SL6-SL10) have been proposed within
ORF1a (Fig. 2C) (Ramya Rangan 2020). The presence of SL6 and SL7 is observed in
other coronaviridae, but the structures do not appear to have an important function

(Brown et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2015). There is one rapidly emerging variant within this
region. C313U occurs within an internal loop region of SL6. The minor allele frequency
of this variant is U=0.011/24227 GISAID, U=0.007/3732 NCBI. The variant is a silent
mutation, converting a CUCLeu codon to a CUULeu codon. As it occurs in an internal loop,
it is expected to have no impact on the stem loop structure.

Variations in the 5´UTR that could have arisen through RNA editing
The two most abundant variants in the 5´UTR are both C to U transitions. C36U
is observed in 2.8% of the sequences from the GISAID cohort, and C241U is observed
in 68%. Excluding singletons, the average frequency of C to U transitions at all other
positions in the 5´UTR is 0.04%. It is possible that the C36U and C241U variations arise
repeatedly during virus replication, or they may have occurred early during the outbreak,
or both. The type of transition and the relative abundance of the C36U and C241U
variations suggest they might be hot spots for viral genome editing by host defense
enzymes. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like
(APOBEC) enzymes are host encoded cytidine deaminases that edit cytidine to uridine
in host nucleic acids (Lerner et al. 2018; Silvas and Schiffer 2019). They also target
single stranded RNA and DNA virus genomes to affect an antiviral response.
If C36U and C241U substitutions arose at such high frequency because of C to U
RNA editing, it might be possible to observe both nucleotides in the same sample of
genomic RNA. cDNA produced from a mixed population of viral RNA harvested from an
individual would be expected to include a weighted average of C and U in the
sequencing reads that could be indicated as a degenerate Y (pyrimidine) in sequencing
data, especially if there are near equal reads of each variation. Because WebLogo3
does not consider degenerate sequencing calls in its calculation of allele frequency
(Crooks et al. 2004), we used SNP-sites v2.5.1 and VCFtools v0.1.7 to recalculate the

allele frequency inclusive of degenerate bases (Danecek et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016).
We calculated the average frequency of all C to Y transitions in the 5´UTR using the
larger GISAID cohort, excluding the two candidate editing sites (C36U and C241U) and
singletons. The average C to Y transition frequency is 0.014%. By contrast, the
frequency of C36Y is 0.063%, 4.5-fold greater than the average, and the frequency of
C241Y is 0.18%, 12.9-fold greater than the average. This apparent increase in
pyrimidine degeneracy is consistent with the possibility that APOBEC enzymes edit both
positions. However, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that some people were
co-infected with both variants leading to the degenerate base call, or that C36U and
C241U frequently arise via some other mechanism during viral replication. The impact of
either variation on viral fitness remains to be determined.

Variations in the frameshifting pseudoknot at the ORF1a/ORF1b junction
An RNA pseudoknot is found at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b (Fig. 3A)
(Ramya Rangan 2020). This structure is involved in -1 programmed ribosome
frameshifting, where translating ribosomes shift frame by one nucleotide to the left.
Efficient frameshifting requires both a “slippery” sequence and a downstream stable
RNA structure (Brierley et al. 1989; Brierley et al. 1992). Like SARS-CoV and MHV, the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot has three stems instead of two typically found in pseudoknot
structures (Brierley and Dos Ramos 2006; Giedroc and Cornish 2009). A previous study
comparing SARS-CoV, MHV, and hybrid variants found that both viral pseudoknots led
to approximately the same extent of programmed frameshifting (~20%), but hybrid
mutant variants in loop 3 that stabilize the pseudoknot structure increased frame shifting
up to 90% (Plant et al. 2010). The same study revealed that silent mutations in the
SARS-CoV slippery site reduced programmed frame shifting by three-fold and also
blocked viral infection in a cell culture model. Thus, the function of the slippery sequence

and the pseudoknot structure is to ensure that production of ORF1a and ORF1ab
polyproteins occurs at appropriate stoichiometric ratios, critical to viral fitness.
We identified one rapidly emerging variant in the frameshifting pseudoknot.
C13536U (U=0.015/23306 GISAID, U=0.003/3440 NCBI) is a silent mutation
(UACTyr:UAUTyr) located within stem 2 (Fig. 4). C13536 normally forms a Watson-Crick
pair with G13493. Mutation to U is expected to cause the formation of a U13536:G13493
wobble pair, which has comparable stability to a Watson-Crick pair but alters the
backbone geometry shifting the G residue into the minor groove. To get a better
understanding of how this U-G pair might impact the tertiary structure and thus the
function of the frameshifting pseudoknot, we used RNAcomposer to build a threedimensional model of the reference sequence and the C13536U variant (Fig 4B)
(Popenda et al. 2012). In the reference model, G13485 forms a base triple with the
C13536:G13493 pair (Fig. 4A). The exocyclic amine of C13536 donates a hydrogen
bond to the O6 of G13485 in loop 1. In the C13536U model, this base triple cannot form
as the hydrogen bond donor is lost. This could conceivably reduce the stability of stem 2,
which would be expected to cause less efficient -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting.
More work will be necessary to define exactly how this variation perturbs the structure

Variations in the 3´UTR in the BSL and PK
Betacoronaviridae 3´UTRs contain a bi-stable molecular switch formed by two
mutually exclusive structural conformers, including one that extends the lower stem of
the bulged stem loop (BSL), and a second that folds into a pseudoknot (PK, Fig. 3B)
(Goebel et al. 2004). Both structured elements are present in MHV, SARS, and MERS,
though the sequence diverges significantly between them (Hsue and Masters 1997;
Hsue et al. 2000; Goebel et al. 2004). In MHV and BCoV, the BSL and the PK structure

are required for viral replication (Hsue and Masters 1997; Williams et al. 1999; Hsue et
al. 2000; Goebel et al. 2004). Mutations that stabilize one form over the other prevent
replication. It is proposed that competition between the two structures plays a regulatory
role in antigenomic RNA synthesis, but the exact mechanism remains to be determined
(Goebel et al. 2004).
There are two rapidly emerging variants in the 5´ portion of the 3´UTR. G29540A
is present at a MAF of A=0.008/24313 (GISAID) and A=0.014/3550 (NCBI). This variant
lies within a single-stranded region that precedes the BSL structure and as such is not
predicted to affect the structure or the molecular switch. In contrast, the G29553A variant
(A=0.012/24216 GISAID, A=0.064/3551 NCBI) disrupts a G:C pair in the extended BSL
molecular switch conformer that could potentially favor the alternate PK structure.
Alternatively, the A substitution may pair with the otherwise bulged U29607 nucleotide,
partially compensating for the loss in of the G:C pair. Consistent with the latter
possibility, RNAfold predicts that the stability of the reference BSL conformer is -20.20
kcal/mol, while the stability of the G29553A variant conformer is -18.30 kcal/mol and
includes a newly formed A:U pair. It remains to be determined how modulation of the
internal equilibrium of the molecular switch affects SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
RNA editing by APOBEC enzymes could lead to rapidly emerging G to A
transitions if the antigenomic strand is edited during viral replication. Antigenomic
cytidine deamination recodes C to U, which would be read as an A during replication of
the genomic strand. To assess this possibility that the G29540A and G29553A variations
arose through RNA editing, we looked for the degenerate base “R” (either purine base)
in both sequencing cohorts using SNP-sites and VCFtools as described above (Danecek
et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016). There were no degenerate R alleles in the GISAID or
NCBI databases at either position, suggesting that neither is produced through frequent
APOBEC-mediated editing of the antigenomic strand.

Variants of the hypervariable region, the S2M structure, and the S3 and S4 stems
An extended multiple stem loop structure exists downstream of the 3´UTR
pseudoknot (Fig 3C) (Ramya Rangan 2020). This structure contains a hypervariable
region (HVR) that folds into a bulged stem loop. The HVR is highly divergent in
coronaviridae with the exception of a strictly conserved single-stranded 8-mer sequence
referred to as the octanucleotide motif (Goebel et al. 2007; Madhugiri et al. 2014). The
function of this region is not well understood, but deletion of the HVR including the
conserved 8mer element has no effect on MHV replication in cultured cells (Goebel et al.
2007). An apparent selfish genetic element, termed S2M, exists within the bulged stem
loop of the HVR (Ramya Rangan 2020). This element is found in many but not all
coronaviridae, and is also found in many other families of positive ssRNA viruses,
suggesting it can be horizontally transferred (Tengs et al. 2013; Tengs and Jonassen
2016). The sequence is highly conserved in all viruses where it is found. This element is
not present in MHV, and its function (if any) is unknown. Two shorter stems, termed S4
and S3, are also present. Mutations that disrupt S4 have no effect on MHV replication,
but S3 appears to be important (Liu et al. 2013).
Five rapidly emerging variants are found in this region of the SARS-CoV-2
genome. Two disrupt Watson-Crick pairs in the HVR bulged stem loop. The A29683U
variation is present at a MAF of U=0.006/23540 (GISAID) and U=3x10-4/3545 (NCBI),
while the A29700G is present at a MAF of G=0.009/23403 (GISAID) and G=0.022/3541
(NCBI). Both variants reduce the stability of a simplified model HVR structure that
eliminates the S2M region in RNAfold calculations (ΔG=–24.20 kcal/molref, –22.20
kcal/molA29683U, –23.9 kcal/molA29700G, Supplemental Fig. 2), with the A29700U variant
forming a compensatory G:U wobble pair. The G29711U variant is present at a MAF of
U=0.007/23366 (GISAID), U=0.004/3537 (NCBI). This variant disrupts the GNRA class

tetraloop structure in the loop of the HVR bulged stem structure, and is predicted to
modestly destabilize the fold (ΔG = -23.5 kcal/molG29711U). The presence of multiple
disruptive variations in this region of the SARS-CoV-2 3´UTR, coupled to previous
reports that the HVR is dispensable for MHV replication, suggests that structures are not
critical to viral replication. More work will be needed to understand whether the
structures in the HVR contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication or viral fitness.
The presence of the rapidly emerging A29700G transition suggests the possibility
that it might arise through adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) RNA editing
activity. ADARs convert adenosine residues to inosine in double stranded regions of
RNA (Keegan et al. 2017). As such, they can play an important role in antiviral response,
targeting double stranded RNA viruses and other viruses (including betacoronaviruses)
that go through a double stranded RNA intermediate (Tomaselli et al. 2015). During viral
replication, inosine residues in the genomic strand would template the incorporation of a
C in place of a U during minus strand synthesis, leading to A to G transitions during viral
replication. As above, we used SNP-sites and VCFtools to measure the frequency of the
degenerate R base at A29700G (Danecek et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016). No degenerate
R nucleotides are present in the GISAID cohort, suggesting that frequent RNA editing by
ADAR enzymes is not responsible for rapid A29700G emergence.
The final two rapidly emerging variations lie within the enigmatic S2M loop. The
structure of the S2M loop from SARS-CoV has been solved by X-ray crystallography
(Fig. 5) (Robertson et al. 2005). Its prevalence in positive strand ssRNA viral genomes,
its position near the 3´-terminus, and its high degree of sequence conservation all imply
a functional role (Tengs and Jonassen 2016). However, not all betacoronaviruses have
the S2M loop, and swapping an S2M-containing region from the SARS-CoV 3´UTR with
an S2M-deficient MHV region did not alter or improve virus replication in vitro (Goebel et
al. 2007). As such, its role in viral replication is unclear.

The first rapidly emerging variation in S2M is G29734C (C=0.008/23285 GISAID,
C=0.003/3525 NCBI). In the SARS-CoV S2M crystal structure, this position forms a noncanonical G:A pair (Fig. 5B) (Robertson et al. 2005). The N2 exocyclic amine donates a
hydrogen bond to the N1 position of its adenosine partner, and the 2´-hydroxyl group
donates a hydrogen bond to the N3 moiety. Substitution of a C in place of G is
incompatible with the hydrogen bonds formed in the G:A pair and as such is likely to
destabilize the S2M tertiary structure. The second rapidly emerging variation in S2M is
G29742U (U=0.009/28235 GISAID, U=0.019/3526 NCBI). This base is involved in a
base quadruple, pairing through its Watson-Crick face with a cytidine residue, but also
interacting with the C of a parallel G:C pair packed tightly into its minor groove (Fig. 5B)
(Robertson et al. 2005). The U variation is incompatible with both the canonical and noncanonical pairings at this position and is likely to be highly destabilizing to the fold.
To evaluate the effect of both of the rapidly emerging variations on the structure
of the S2M loop, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the S2M loop
from SARS-CoV and of both variants. The X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV S2M loop
served as initial conformation for all simulations (Robertson et al. 2005). The results
confirmed our predictions: both variations destabilize the structure of the S2M domain. In
each case we observed that the structure of the S2M loop undergoes a transition quickly
after equilibration (within the first 60 ns) to a less compact conformation as shown in
Figure 6A-F. To quantify the extent of the transition, we measured the length of the
maximum dimension of the S2M loop and observed an extension (Fig. 6I-K).
Surprisingly, we observed that the S2M loop of SARS-CoV also samples similarly
extended conformations (Fig. 6I), although this happens more slowly and with a lower
frequency than in the other two variants, in only two out of the four trajectories that we
collected (Supplemental Fig. 3A-C). Analysis of the MD trajectories showed that one
important element for the stability of the overall structure of the S2M loop is the

stabilizing interaction between G29734 and A29756. When these two nucleotides are in
close proximity to one another, the stem tertiary structure is reorganized by bending.
This interaction is destabilized in the G29734C variant because C cannot form hydrogen
bonds with A29756. However, we observed that the formation of an A-G base pair is not
stable in all three sequence variations (Fig. 6G). In the absence of this base pair,
A29756 can move far from G/C29734 (Fig. 6L-N) leading to the sampling of more
extended conformations of the loop as shown in figure Fig6 C-F. With the exception of
the tails that unfold and refold, the secondary structure of the S2M loop is generally well
preserved

conformations as a result of the loss of tertiary interactions (Fig. 6G). A major difference
between these variants is that the base pairing is not as stable in the stem-loop structure
in the presence of the G29742U variation (Fig. 6G-H). This variation in sequence affects
the stability of the base quartet described above (Fig. 5A), and ultimately impacts the
stability of the adjacent base pairs (Fig. 6H). The base quartet is at the junction between
the two helices and is important to set their relative orientations. The G29742U variation
causes a local melting of the secondary structure and a disruption of this junction,
ultimately destabilizing the compact conformation of the S2M loop (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an explosion in whole genome
sequencing of naturally occurring viral isolates. These data have been useful in the
identification of rapidly emerging variations that impact viral protein structure and
function (Kim et al. 2020b; Pachetti et al. 2020). They have also been used to monitor
the spread of the virus through molecular phylogeny (Chu et al. 2020; Coronaviridae
Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of 2020; Forster et al. 2020).

Here, we have used available data to investigate how rapidly emerging variants could
impact structured cis-regulatory elements in the virus genome. These elements govern
viral replication, subgenomic RNA synthesis, and translation control in other
betacoronaviruses (Yang and Leibowitz 2015; Madhugiri et al. 2016). Rapidly emerging
variants could enhance or dampen viral pathogenesis and overall fitness, which could
affect the extent and duration of the outbreak. As such, it is critically important to
understand how such variations arise, and what regions of the genome are most prone
to mutation.
Due to the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there is renewed interest in the
development of novel strategies to treat betacoronavirus infections. Functional RNA
structures in the viral genome could provide new targets for small molecule therapeutic
development. Many antibiotics work through interactions with ribosomal RNA structure,
and RNA targeting small molecule drugs are currently approved or in development for a
variety of infectious and genetic diseases (Guan and Disney 2012). The SARS-CoV-2
genome has many structured elements that could be targeted, including SL1-SL4 in the
5´UTR, the frameshifting pseudoknot at the ORF1a and ORF1b boundary, and the
molecular switch in the 3´UTR. The results presented here suggest that the
hypervariable region, including the S2M structure, might be less well suited to targeted
drug development. Structures with rapidly emerging variations are problematic for drug
development as well, as the relatively high viral mutation rate, coupled to its potential to
be edited by APOBEC and ADAR enzymes, could lead to the rapid evolution of resistant
variants.
Similarly, hybridization-guided therapeutics, such as antisense oligonucleotides,
small interfering RNAs, and CRISPR-derived drugs could potentially be targeted to the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. Unstructured regions in noncoding regions of the viral genome
make particularly compelling targets, as access will not be blocked by RNA structure or

complementarity to achieve target specificity, rapid virus evolution could prove their
Achilles’ heel. The data presented here identify regions less prone to variation, making
them better candidates for RNA-guided therapeutics.
The observation that SL1 is prone to rapidly emerging variations is interesting, as
this region is not only present on the positive strand of the viral genome, but is also
found on all subgenomic RNAs (Kim et al. 2020a). Moreover, the complement to SL1 in
antigenomic RNA is likely recognized by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)
to produce genomic copies of the viral RNA. As such, it could make a good target for
therapeutic development. However, the presence of multiple variations, often in
combination, makes strategies that rely upon base pairing unlikely to be effective for all
virus subtypes. The diversity of variations that enhance the stability of SL1, including
variations that lengthen the stem, suggests that SL1 stability is important to SARS-CoV2 replication. But if stability matters more than sequence identity, we can expect the
evolution of rapid resistance to therapeutics designed to modulate SL1 stability.
The bi-stable molecular switch in the 3´UTR is potentially the most compelling
structure for targeted drug discovery. It is conceptually straightforward to design
antisense oligonucleotides that lock the switch into one conformer or the other. Both
conformers are necessary for MHV replication, and only one rapidly emerging variant of
minimal consequence was identified in this region. It is likely that this switch plays a role
in SARS-CoV-2 replication, as has been observed in other betacoronaviruses. More
work will be necessary to assess its potential as a drug target.
RNA editing appears to play a role in two rapidly emerging variations near stem
loop structures in the 5´UTR. The prevalence of RNA editing of the viral genome is not
known, and it remains unclear whether editing affects viral fitness or pathogenesis. It will

be interesting to assess the extent of RNA editing during active infection, a task that
would probably be best achieved through direct RNA sequencing (Kim et al. 2020a).
The analyses presented in this study will only improve as more sequencing data
are added to available repositories (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and McCauley
2017). It is possible that identification of more rapidly emerging variants will clarify some
of the remaining ambiguities. The results presented here highlight the power of highthroughput sequencing of viral genomes to define viral cis-regulatory elements, and
stand as a testament to the researchers collecting, sequencing, and sharing viral
genomic data to help quell the impact of this tragic and overwhelming pandemic.

Materials and Methods
Calculation of allele frequency and occupancy
The Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank Accession Number
MN908947) was used as a reference genome. The sequences corresponding to the
5´UTR (1-265), the ORF1a structured region (266-450), the frameshifting pseudoknot
(13457-13546), and the 3´UTR (29534-29870) were used as queries in a BLASTN
search (Altschul et al. 1990). For the NCBI cohort, BLASTN searches were performed
against the NCBI betacoronavirus database of 11,495 (as of May 14th, 2020)
betacoronavirus sequences. Searches were performed using the web portal with default
parameters except “max target sequences” was set to 20,000. BLAST hits were filtered
by organism for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, and the remaining
hits were downloaded as a hit table and aligned sequences. A multiple sequence
alignment was prepared using a locally installed copy of MAFFT version 7.464 using the
default FFT-NS-2 algorithm (Katoh et al. 2002). The output file was then analyzed with a
locally installed copy of WebLogo3 version 3.6.0 (Crooks et al. 2004). The resultant logo
data table contains the calculated sequence entropy, the occupancy (weight), and the

count number for each base at each position. The allele frequency was then calculated
by dividing the count number by the sum of all counts for all four bases. The minor allele
frequency is defined as the frequency of the second most abundant allele and is typically
represented by the format variant=frequency/counts.
For the GISAID cohort, 24,468 curated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were
downloaded from the GISAID Initiative EpiCoV database (on May 13th, 2020) under the
terms of their data access agreement (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett 2017; Shu and
McCauley 2017). The genomic sequences were compiled into a blast library using a
locally installed copy of BLAST+ version 2.8.1, and queried using the command line tool
blastn as describe above with the exception that the max_target_seqs flag was set to
30,000 (Camacho et al. 2009). Aligned sequences were recovered from the resulting hit
table using a custom shell command, then analyzed using MAFFT and WebLogo3 as
described for the NCBI cohort above.

Calculation of minimum free energy structures:
The sequence corresponding to SL1 and flanking nucleotides (1-37), the BSL
and flanking nucleotides (29,547-29,643), or variations thereof were input into the web
server for RNAfold using the default parameters (Lorenz et al. 2011). The calculated ΔG
for the minimum energy structure, the ensemble free energy, the frequency of the
minimum free energy structure in the ensemble, the ensemble diversity, and the
secondary structure in dot-bracket notation were recorded in Supplementary Table 3.
The bulged stem loop in the HVR (29,627-29,834) and variants thereof were analyzed
by the same approach, except nucleotides 29,721 through 29,800 were removed to
simplify the overall structure. RNAfold was not able to accurately calculate the
secondary structure of the region surrounding the s2m structure.

Phylogenetic analysis of SL1 variants
Examples of the specific combination variants U34U35U36C37 and U34U35U36A37 were
recovered from the GISAID cohort 5´UTR BLASTn hits by searching for the variation
plus two invariant nucleotides on either side using custom shell commands. Each variant
combination was searched using this approach to count the number of occurrences and
to recover the sequence. Following alignment, the hits were inspected to ensure the
correct pattern match, and in one instance, manually edited to remove an example
where the search pattern identified a match at the incorrect position. The sequence IDs
were then used to recover the intact genomic sequence from the GISAID cohort library.
MAFFT was then used to generate multiple sequence alignments of the entire genome
using the procedure outlined above. Output files were loaded into MEGAX version
10.1.8 (for Mac), and the maximum likelihood tree was calculated using the Tamura-Nei
model (Tamura and Nei 1993; Stecher et al. 2020).

Degenerate base frequency analysis
Because WebLogo3 does not consider degenerate base calls, the MAFFT-generated
MSA files outlined above were converted into VCF format using a locally installed copy
of SNP-sites version 2.5.1. The allele frequencies were then re-analyzed using VCFtools
version 0.1.17 (Danecek et al. 2011; Page et al. 2016). The abundance of Y or R
degenerate base calls for specific positions was calculated from the overall frequency
each base, excluding counts for symbols that denote the absence of a base at the given
position.

Molecular modeling of the frameshifting pseudoknot and variants
Three-dimensional molecular models of the frame shifting pseudoknot (13,472-13,543)
and variants thereof were calculated using the RNAcomposer web server. The modeling

algorithm was guided using dot-bracket notation to match the recently published
secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 (Popenda et al. 2012; Ramya Rangan 2020). The
output PDB files were visualized and analyzed in Pymol version 1.7.6.0.

Molecular Dynamics simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with NAMD 2.13 (Phillips et al. 2005)
using the CHARMM 36 force field (MacKerell et al. 1998). The X-ray structure of SARSCoV S2M RNA (PDB code 1XJR) was used as the initial structure for the SARS-CoV
and the G29734C and G29742U variants after performing the respective mutations
using the Mutator plug-in of VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996). In VMD, each structure was
solvated with a water box with explicit TIP3P (Jorgensen et al. 1983; MacKerell et al.
1998) solvent and an ionic concentration of 0.15 M NaCl. The box was much larger than
the initial structure (cubic box of 106 Å) to allow for extension of the RNA. Four
independent trajectories of each system (WT, G11C, and G19U) were generated with
the following procedure. The solvated structures were first minimized using the
conjugate gradient method for 500 steps to relax any high energy contacts or unphysical
geometries. An additional 2,000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization were
performed with the heavy atoms of the RNA and the two Mg2+ ions restrained with a
harmonic constraint force of 10 kcal/mol-1 Å2. Next, particle velocities were randomly
assigned from the Maxwell distribution and equilibration was performed in the
isothermal-isobaric ensemble gradually decreasing the restraints to zero (using 9 stages
of 50 ps each). The pressure and temperature were maintained at 1 atm and 298 K
using Langevin dynamics and the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method. The SHAKE
constraint algorithm (Ryckaert et al. 1977) was used to allow a 2 fs time step. The
particle mesh Ewald method (Essmann et al. 1995) was used to calculate electrostatic
interactions with periodic boundary conditions. Production trajectories were then

collected using the isothermal-isobaric ensemble for 180 ns. The Mg2+ ions remained
stably coordinated throughout the trajectories.
Trajectory analysis was performed with VMD (Humphrey et al. 1996) and
structures were visualized with VMD using the STRIDE algorithm for secondary structure
identification (Frishman and Argos 1995). A hydrogen bond is defined by a donoracceptor distance of less than 3.5 Å and a donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle of 130° < θ <
180°. The ring distance between a pair of nucleotides was calculated as the center of
mass distance between the atoms N1, C2, N3, C4, C5, and C6. The maximum
dimension of the RNA structure was calculated by aligning the trajectories with the
starting structure (where the longest axis of the RNA was aligned with the y-axis) and
finding the maximum dimension of the box needed to fully contain the RNA.
