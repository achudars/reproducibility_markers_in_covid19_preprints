The multifunctional nucleocapsid (N) protein in SARS-CoV-2
binds the ∼30 kb viral RNA genome to aid its packaging into the
80-90 nm membrane-enveloped virion. The N protein is composed of N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization
domains that are flanked by three intrinsically disordered regions. Here we demonstrate that a centrally located 40 amino
acid intrinsically disordered domain drives phase separation of
N protein when bound to RNA, with the morphology of the resulting condensates affected by inclusion in the RNA of the putative SARS-CoV-2 packaging signal. The SARS-CoV-2 M protein, normally embedded in the virion membrane with its Cterminus extending into the virion core, independently induces
N protein phase separation that is dependent on the N protein’s
C-terminal dimerization domain and disordered region. Threecomponent mixtures of N+M+RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N+M or N+RNA, including spherical annular structures in which the M protein
coats the outside of an N+RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the N protein with
both the viral genomic RNA and the SARS-CoV-2 M protein
facilitates RNA packaging and virion assembly.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
a highly contagious betacoronavirus (1, 2). Coronaviruses
comprise a large family of positive-stranded RNA viruses,
whose ∼30 kb genome is packaged into a membraneenveloped virion 80-90 nm in diameter (3, 4). The first
two-thirds of the genome encodes two polyproteins that
are processed by virally-encoded proteases into nonstructural proteins and which assemble into the viral replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC) (5). The final third of the
genome generates sub-genomic RNAs encoding accessory
proteins plus the four main structural proteins of the virion:
the spike (S) protein that recognizes cell receptors, the nucleocapsid (N) protein responsible for viral RNA packaging, and
the membrane-associated envelope (E) and membrane (M)
proteins ((6, 7).
The RNA-binding N protein plays two major roles in the
coronavirus life cycle. Its primary role is to assemble with genomic RNA into the viral RNA-protein(vRNP) complex, and
mediate vRNP packaging into virions via poorly-understood
interactions between the N and M (membrane) proteins (8–
10). Second, the N protein localizes to replicase-transcriptase

complexes at early stages of infection, where it is thought
to facilitate viral RNA synthesis and translation by recruiting host factors and promoting RNA template switching (11–
15). To accomplish these important functions, betacoronavirus N proteins have evolved a modular architecture with
two conserved, folded domains flanked by three intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs). The N-terminal domain (NTD)
is thought to mediate a specific interaction with the viral
genome’s “packaging signal”, and the C-terminal domain
(CTD) forms a compact dimer that has been proposed to aid
vRNP assembly (16–21). These two domains are separated
by a conserved central IDR containing a serine/argininerich region (SR) that is highly phosphorylated in infected
cells (22–26), and are flanked by less well-conserved IDRs
at the N- and C-terminus. The C-terminal IDR of the related SARS-CoV N protein has been implicated in M protein
binding, suggesting an important role for this domain in viral
packaging (9, 10).
In isolation, betacoronavirus N proteins self-associate into
dimers, tetramers, and larger oligomers that are thought to
form the basis for assembly of the vRNP complex (21, 27–
29). Electron microscopy analysis of several betacoronaviruses has suggested that in the virion, the N protein
mediates assembly of a helical filament-like vRNP complex (3, 30–32). Recent cryo-electron tomography of SARSCoV-2 virions has revealed a more granular vRNP structure,
with each virion containing 35-40 individual vRNP complexes that adopt a cylindrical shell-like structure ∼15 nm
in diameter (4, 33). Many such vRNPs are membraneproximal and show a characteristic orientation with respect to
the membrane, suggesting potential specific interactions with
the membrane-associated M protein (33). Within the vRNP,
tentative modeling based on known NTD and CTD structures
suggests a specific assembly with ∼800 nt of genomic RNA
(30 kb divided among ∼38 vRNPs) wrapped around ∼12
copies of the N protein (33). Individual vRNPs could also
form linear stacks resembling helical filaments (4, 33), reconciling the apparent conflict with earlier observations and
suggesting that betacoronavirus vRNPs may adopt a broadly
conserved architecture.
In recent years, many RNA-binding proteins with intrinsically disordered regions have been found to undergo liquidliquid phase separation with RNA, and these biomolecular
condensates are thought to orchestrate a large number of
important biological processes and in some cases drive disease (34–41). The structural features of the betacoronavirus

N protein and its diverse roles in viral RNA metabolism
and virion assembly make it tempting to hypothesize that
phase separation may play a role in this protein’s functions.
Here we combine in vitroreconstitution approaches and cellular assays to determine the phase separation behavior of
the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. We first demonstrate that RNA
can induce the assembly of the N protein into gel-like phaseseparated condensates in vitro, and pinpoint a ∼40-residue
region within the central IDR as necessary for RNA-driven
phase separation. We also characterized the interaction between N and a soluble fragment of the M protein, which
we find independently mediates N protein phase separation
through an interaction with the protein’s C-terminal domains.
Three-component mixtures of N, M, and RNA are found
to assemble into condensates with distinct internal compartments or layers containing N+RNA or N+M, suggesting that
M and RNA repel one another despite each interacting with
N. This mutual exclusion often yielded two-layered condensates with an internal N+RNA compartment surrounded by
an outer layer of N+M. These data provide mechanistic insights into the phase separation behavior of SARS-CoV-2 N,
and suggest that virion assembly may be driven by specific
but mutually exclusive interactions of N with genomic RNA
and the viral membrane-associated M protein.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 N undergoes RNA-dependent phase
separation. To investigate the mechanistic basis for

nucleocapsid-mediated RNA packaging, we first purified
bacterially-expressed recombinant full-length N protein.
While purification in buffers with high salt concentration
(1M NaCl) yielded pure protein, purification in lower-salt
buffers resulted in retention of bacterial nucleic acids and
aggregation of the protein as judged by size-exclusion
chromatography (21). Recognizing this and recent findings
that intrinsically-disordered RNA-binding proteins undergo
liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro (34–41), we investigated whether the SARS-CoV-2 N protein shares this
property. We mixed Cy5-labeled full-length N protein with
a non-specific 17-mer ssRNA labeled with fluorescein (6FAM), and observed formation of spherical phase-separated
condensates containing both components (Fig. 1A). Condensates formed in a specific range of RNA concentration,
above which phase separation was inhibited (Fig. 1A).
This “re-entrant” phase separation behavior is commonly
observed in two-component systems including RNA-protein
mixtures (42). With 10 µM N protein, maximal phase separation occurred in the presence of 5 µM 17-mer RNA (85 µM
nucleotide), above which phase separation was inhibited
(Fig. 1A). The observation that N forms condensates with a
very short RNA suggests that phase separation in this case
is driven largely by multivalent protein-protein interactions.
In agreement with this idea, purified N formed condensates
without addition of RNA (Fig. S1A), but these were much
smaller and fewer than those formed in the presence of RNA.
We next examined the behavior of the N protein with three

larger RNAs derived from the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig 1B,
S1B, Table S1): (1) UTR265, the first 265 bases of the viral
genome which contains the leader sequence (located at nt 2081) that in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was shown to bind
the N protein with high affinity (43, 44); (2) UTR1000, the
first 1000 bases of the viral genome that includes the 5’-UTR
and part of the ORF1ab gene; (3) PS576, a 576-nt sequence
located near the end of the ORF1ab gene (nt 19786-20361)
corresponding to the putative packaging signal for SARSCoV viral RNA (45, 46). We found that addition of 20 ng/µL
(∼62 µM nucleotide) viral RNA fragments containing the
5’ UTR to 10 µM N protein induced the formation of round
condensates (Fig. 1C). In contrast, addition of the PS576
fragment caused the formation of more amorphous structures resembling a fibrillar network (Fig. 1C). The distinct
structures formed with PS576 compared to 17-mer RNA or
UTR-derived RNAs suggests that the viral packaging signal
may interact differently with the N protein than nonspecific
RNA (see Discussion). All of these condensates grew with
time and displayed classical behaviors such as droplet fusion
(Fig. 1D, S1C). Similarly, N protein and viral RNA also
display “re-entrant” phase separation behavior (Fig. S1D).
Cryo-electron tomography of N protein+RNA condensates
revealed well-defined texture suggestive of internal order
(Fig. 1E), which was also observed by super-resolution
light microscopy (Fig. S1E). In particular, these condensates
resemble electron-dense virus-like particles observed in the
periphery of infected cells and also released alongside intact
virions, which may comprise packaged RNAs that have not
undergone membrane envelopment (33).
We also determined the effect of salt concentration on the
formation of gel-like condensates with N protein. The N
protein formed condensates on its own at very low salt concentrations (20 mM KCl), while addition of RNA enhanced
N protein phase separation at salt concentrations approaching
physiological (higher than 80 mM KCl) (Fig. S1F). Thus,
while the N protein has an inherent tendency to de-mix
through self-interactions, additional interactions with RNA
(or other proteins; see below) enhance phase separation in
physiologically-relevant conditions.
Next, we explored the biophysical properties of N+RNA
condensates by fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching
(FRAP). Full bleaching and partial bleaching of N+RNA
condensates indicated that the N protein is very slowly
exchanged with the soluble pool and within the structures,
with recovery of only ∼12% fluorescence intensity in 2
minutes after bleaching (Fig. 2). In condensates formed
with the short 17-mer RNA, the RNA was highly mobile
and freely exchanged (Fig. 2A-B). The mobility of this short
RNA decreased with longer incubation times, indicating that
initial liquid-like condensates mature to a more solid gel-like
structure with time (Fig. S2A). In condensates of N protein
with the larger virus-derived RNAs, both RNA and N protein
showed slow dynamics (Fig. 2C-D). N protein dynamics
were independent of the length of RNA in the condensates
(Fig. 2C-D), but in these condensates the longer RNAs
showed much slower dynamics than the N protein, with

the longest viral RNA showing the lowest mobility. These
data suggest that long viral RNAs interact with multiple N
proteins and are trapped inside a framework formed by the N
protein. Consistent with these slow dynamics, the fusion of
N protein droplets was slow (Fig. 1D) and soluble N protein
was incorporated very slowly into pre-existing N+RNA
condensates (Fig. S2B).
The central IDR is critical for RNA-mediated phase
separation. The N protein has multiple intrinsically disor-

dered regions (IDRs) based on sequence alignments, disorder prediction, and IDR prediction algorithms including the
catGRANULE server (47) (Fig. S3A): (1) the N-terminal
IDR (aa 1-48), (2) the central IDR (aa 175-246) that consists of a serine/arginine rich region (aa 175-205) followed
by a leucine/glutamine rich region (48) (Fig. S3C), and (3)

the C-terminal IDR (aa 365-419). The folded RNA-binding
N-terminal domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain
are flanked by these three IDR regions (28, 49). In related
betacoronavirus N proteins, each of these domains has been
shown to bind RNA with different affinities (18, 43–45, 50).
To determine the contribution of different domains to the protein’s ability to form phase-separated condensates with RNA,
we purified a series of truncations deleting the N-terminal
IDR (N49-419 ), the C-terminal IDR (N1-364 ), or both N- and
C-terminal IDRs (N49-364 ). We found that while truncations
removing the N- or C-terminal IDRs retained the ability to
form phase-separated condensates with RNA, the resulting
condensates were smaller than those formed from full-length
protein, suggesting that these IDRs may play a minor role in
phase separation (Fig. 3A-D). The isolated N-terminal half of
the N protein (N1-246 ) underwent RNA-dependent phase sep-

aration, while the isolated C-terminal half (N247-419 ) did not
(Fig. 3E, 3F).
To further delineate which domain of N1-246 is required
for phase separation, we generated four additional truncations: N49-246 , N49-209 , N1-174 , and N49-174 . As expected, removal of the N-terminal IDR (N49-246 ) did not strongly affect
RNA-mediated phase separation (Fig. 3G). As we previously
found that the N1-246 construct is proteolytically sensitive
(Fig. S3B) (21), we used mass spectrometry to map the cleavage site to residue 209 in the central IDR, just after the S/R
rich subdomain. Removing residues 210-246 (N49-209 ) eliminated RNA-mediated phase separation (Fig. 3H). Constructs
lacking the entire central IDR (N1-174 and N49-174 ) also failed
to phase separate with RNA (Fig. 3I, 3J). Like the full-length
protein, without RNA all these N protein truncations did not
phase separate at all or at a level much lower than in the presence of RNA (Fig. S3D). Correspondingly, the truncations
with an intact central IDR domain also robustly underwent
phase separation with viral RNA UTR265 (Fig. S3E).
Overall, these data show that residues 210-246 in the central
IDR are critical for SARS-CoV-2 N protein phase separation
with RNA (Fig. 3K). While we were unable to test the effect
of removing the RNA-binding NTD due to inherent instability of the isolated central IDR, we propose that RNA-induced
phase separation likely requires both the RNA-binding NTD
and the central IDR, with the NTD contributing most of the
RNA binding capacity, and the central IDR mediating higherorder assembly and phase separation.

the N protein is dynamically located to the viral replicasetranscriptase complex and is required for efficient viral RNA
transcription (11–15). Consistently, a recent proteomic study
showed that SARS-CoV-2 N strongly interacts with cellular RNA processing machinery, including many stress granule proteins and several RNA helicases including DDX1,
which has been reported to be involved in viral RNA synthesis (26, 51). These data suggest that the N protein may
form phase-separated condensates in cells to promote recruitment of factors that facilitate viral RNA synthesis. To assess the ability of the N protein to phase-separate in cells, we
generated a stably-transformed human osteosarcoma U2OS
cell line expressing Clover-tagged SARS-CoV-2 N under the
control of an inducible promoter (Fig. 4A). One day after induction of N protein expression, N protein condensates were initially formed within cells (Fig. 4A-B). Use
of FRAP analysis established that the N protein was highly
dynamic in these structures, with 80% fluorescence recovery within 1 min (Fig.4B-C). This apparent liquid-like behavior strongly contrasts to N+RNA condensates that in vitro
show a more gel-like structure, suggesting dynamic regulation of the N protein’s phase separation behavior in cells.
Notably, in related coronaviruses the S/R rich subdomain in
the central IDR becomes highly phosphorylated in infected
cells (22, 23, 25, 26) and this subdomain’s proximity to the
key region mediating phase separation suggests that condensation is likely regulated by phosphorylation. In agreement with this idea, mimicking S/R phosphorylation through
serine-to-aspartic acid mutations was recently reported to increase the liquid-like properties of SARS-CoV-2 N+RNA
condensates in vitro (52). The different behavior of phos-

phorylated versus unphosphorylated forms of N may reflect
adaptation to its two distinct roles, with liquid-like phosphorylated condensates promoting viral replication and gel-like
unphosphorylated condensates mediate viral RNA packaging
in virions (52).
The SARS-CoV-2 M protein independently promotes N
protein phase separation. The abundant transmembrane

M protein acts as an organizational hub for virion assembly
through its binding to both the membrane-anchored spike
protein and to the N protein/viral RNA complex via a soluble
C-terminal domain (CTD) extending into the virion (9, 53)
(Fig. 5A). In related coronaviruses, direct interactions
between M and N have been reported, with the C-terminal
IDR of N particularly implicated in this interaction (9, 10).
To better understand how the SARS-CoV-2 M and N proteins
interact to mediate virion assembly, we purified the soluble
C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 M (aa 104-222) fused to
GFP (Fig. 5A, S4A) and mixed it with purified Cy5-labeled
N protein. Purified GFP-M104-222 induced N protein demixing even in the absence of RNA and that the size of
phase-separated condensates increased with GFP-M104-222
concentration (Fig. 5B, S4B). By itself, GFP-M104-222 did not
form condensates (Fig. 5A). At higher concentration, N+M
condensates formed amorphous aggregate-like structures,
suggesting that M protein promotes the nucleation of N
protein into dense gel-like assemblies. FRAP analysis confirmed the solid-like property of these structures (Fig. S4C).

Next, we used our truncations of the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein to determine the region required for phase separation
with M, focusing particularly on the previously-implicated
C-terminal region (Fig. 5C-I). We found that removal of the
N terminal IDR (N49-419 ) does not affect N/M de-mixing.
Further removal of the C-terminal IDR (N49-364 ) decreases
the level of de-mixing, suggesting that this domain plays a
role in M protein binding. Removal of the C-terminal dimerization domain (N1-246 ) completely eliminated N/M phase
separation (Fig. 5F), while the C-terminal part of N protein
(N247-419 ), containing the C-terminal dimerization domain
and C-terminal IDR, was sufficient for M protein-dependent
phase separation (Fig. 5G). An N protein fragment retaining
only the C-terminal dimerization domain (N247-364 ) phase
separated with M, albeit to a lesser extent than N247-419
(Fig. 5H). RNA did not induce M protein phase separation in
the absence of N (Fig. S4D). These results support the idea
that the N protein C-terminal region interacts with M, and
that this interaction can promote the assembly of gel-like
condensates in the absence of RNA. Further, RNA-mediated
and M-mediated phase separation rely on distinct domains
of the N protein.
Finally, we explored the behavior of three-component
systems including N, M, and RNA. Within 20 minutes of
addition of GFP-M104-222 to pre-assembled condensates
of N+RNA, GFP-M104-222 formed an annular shell on the
condensate surface that was then stable for hours (Fig. S5A).

simultaneously, RNA and M formed mutually exclusive
condensates with N. In condensates that formed with
N+M+RNA, M and RNA occupied mutually exclusive
subdomains, for example, with a central core of N+RNA
surrounded by a shell of N+M, or vice versa (Fig. 5J, S5B).
Thus, despite the N protein forming condensates with
RNA and the M protein through distinct domains, these
condensates appear to be mutually exclusive.

Discussion
A critical step in the life cycle of any virus is the packaging
of its genome into new virions. This is an especially challenging problem for betacoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2,
with its large ∼30 kb RNA genome. Here, we demonstrate
that the SARS-COV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein, the structural protein largely responsible for binding, compacting,
and packaging the viral genome, undergoes phase separation into gel-like condensates with the SARS-COV-2 M
protein and RNA, including RNAs derived from the viral
genome 5’ UTR and the region corresponding to the putative

packaging signal of SARS-CoV. Our findings parallel
recent reports of RNA-mediated phase separation by the
nucleocapsid proteins from other viruses, including Measles
virus and HIV-1 (54, 55). Our findings also parallel not-yet
peer-reviewed reports of SARS-CoV-2 N+RNA phase
separation (52, 56–59). These findings, plus recognition that
many other viral nucleocapsid proteins possess domains with
high predicted disorder (60), suggest a general role for phase
separation in viral genome packaging and virion assembly.
We pinpoint the region of SARS-CoV-2 N responsible for
RNA-mediated phase separation as a subdomain of the
protein’s central IDR, residues 210-246, which is adjacent to
the phospho-regulated serine/arginine (S/R)-rich subdomain
(Fig. 6A). A recent molecular dynamics analysis of this
region identified a putative hydrophobic α-helix spanning
residues ∼213-225, supporting the idea that this region
may be directly involved in protein-protein interactions to
promote phase separation (58). We also found that a soluble
fragment of the viral membrane-associated M protein
interacts with N and independently induces the formation
of phase-separated condensates. Three-component mixtures
give rise to structures strongly reminiscent of the expected
architecture of these components in virions (33, 61) with a
central core of N+RNA surrounded by a shell of N+M.
Our data on N-RNA and N-M interactions have important
implications for understanding how the SARS-CoV-2
genome is packaged into developing virions. Recent highresolution cryo-electron tomography of intact SARS-CoV-2
virions has revealed that individual viral RNA-protein
complexes (vRNPs) adopt a characteristic shell-like architecture ∼15 nm in diameter, comprising ∼12 N proteins
and ∼800 nt of RNA (4, 33). Negative-stain electron
microscopy of soluble N+RNA complexes has revealed
similar particles (52), suggesting that viral RNA packaging
is mediated first by assembly of individual vRNPs along
the genomic RNA, followed by condensation of these RNPs
and recruitment to developing virions through interactions
with the M protein at the cytoplasmic side of the ER-Golgi
intermediate compartment (Fig. 6B) (4, 61). Our finding that
the M protein can independently mediate phase separation
of N suggests that a network of membrane-associated M
proteins could mediate recruitment of N+RNA condensates
into the developing virion (61).
Given the variety of RNAs in infected cells, including
both host mRNAs and viral subgenomic RNAs, how is the
full-length viral genome specifically recruited and packaged
into virions? Current models posit that the N protein likely
binds specifically to a viral RNA sequence that adopts a
characteristic 3D structure. A recent computational analysis
offers a compelling model for how phase separation might
contribute to packaging specificity. Specifically, high-affinity
binding of N to a particular site in the 30 kb genome
could seed the assembly of vRNPs along the RNA through
lower-affinity interactions, and drive condensation of stable
“single-genome condensates” that can then be packaged
into a virion (58). This model is indirectly supported by the
recent observation of dense virus-like particles ∼50-80 nm

(A) Domain organization of SARSCoV-2 N protein, with domains responsible for phase separation with RNA (RNAbinding domain and central IDR) and M protein (C-terminal domains) marked. Related work suggests a role for phosphorylation of the SR-rich region in regulating
the gel vs. liquid behavior of N+RNA condensates (52). (B) Proposed assembly
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 virions. Viral RNPs with ∼12 copies of N and 800 nt

M drive RNA packaging into virions. Within the virion, individual vRNPs show characteristic orientation on the viral envelope (33) supporting a role for specific N+M
interactions in packaging.

in diameter in infected cells, which may represent N+RNA
condensates that have not yet been enveloped (33). The
specific packaging signal is not identified for SARS-CoV-2
but may be located in the 5’ UTR or within the ORF1ab
gene (43, 44, 56) . We find that N forms condensates with
diverse RNAs, but that the morphology of condensates
formed with the sequence equivalent to the putative SARSCoV packaging signal (PS576) is distinct from those formed
with other RNAs. While this observation suggests that
specific RNAs could alter the phase separation behavior of
N, parallel studies have shown that altering the RNA-protein
ratio in condensates can give rise to similar morphological
changes (52). Further study will be required to both identify
the SARS-CoV-2 packaging signal and determine how it
modulates N+RNA phase separation to promote packaging
of single genomes into developing virions.
In addition to their central role in viral RNA packaging,
betacoronavirus N proteins participate in viral RNA transcription, especially the discontinuous transcription of
subgenomic mRNAs (62). In cells, the protein is dynamically recruited to replicase-transcriptase complexes through
an interaction with viral replicase subunit NSP3 (12, 63).
This activity is promoted by hyperphosphorylation of the N
protein in the S/R-rich region within the central IDR, and
phosphorylated N protein can recruit host factors like RNA
helicases to promote viral RNA template switching and

RNA- and M protein-mediated phase separation of SARS-CoV-2 N protein

subgenomic mRNA transcription (26). In contrast, N protein
incorporated into virions is hypophosphorylated (25, 26). We
and others have shown that N protein condensates in cells
show a more liquid-like behavior than those assembled in
vitro , and recent reports directly implicate phosphorylation
of the S/R-rich region in this behavior difference (52, 56).
Given the proximity of the S/R-rich region (aa 175-205) to
the region we implicate in RNA-mediated phase separation
(aa 210-246), it is not surprising that phosphorylation in
this region could strongly affect N-protein self-interactions
and alter the properties of the resulting condensates. In
this manner, the physical properties of N+RNA condensates
could be tuned depending on whether it is promoting viral
transcription (hyperphosphorylated, liquid-like) or RNA
packaging (hypophosphorylated, gel-like).
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic demands a concerted
effort to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent new
infections and lessen the severity of the infection in patients.
The concurrent finding by a number of groups (52, 56–59)
that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein undergoes phase separation
with RNA, and that this behavior is likely critically involved
in viral RNA packaging during virion development, offers
a new step in the viral life cycle that could be targeted with
therapeutics. Our finding that phase separation also drives
interactions with the viral M protein highlights another
interaction that could be targeted to disrupt the viral life
cycle. Our observations that purified N protein readily
phase-separates with RNA or M protein in vitro, and that
N forms condensates when expressed in mammalian cells,
suggest several straightforward experimental strategies to
test whether FDA-approved drugs or novel therapeutics may
disrupt these assemblies. Such a strategy could provide an
important complement to current therapeutic efforts targeting
other steps in the viral life cycle.

Materials and Methods
Cloning and Protein Purification. SARS-CoV-2 N protein

constructs (NFL , N1-364 , N49-419 , N49-364 , N1-264 , N247-419 ,
N49-246 , N49-209 , N1-174 , N49-174 ) were amplified by PCR
from the IDT 2019-nCoV N positive control plasmid (IDT
cat. # 10006625; NCBI RefSeq YP_009724397) and inserted
by ligation-independent cloning into UC Berkeley Macrolab vector 2B-T (AmpR, N-terminal His6 -fusion; Addgene
#29666) for expression in E. coli. The gene expressing M
protein residues 104-222 was synthesized by IDT, and inserted into UC Berkeley Macrolab vector 1GFP (KanR, Nterminal His6 -GFP fusion; Addgene #29663). Plasmids were
transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta 2(DE3) pLysS (Novagen), and grown in the presence of ampicillin or kanamycin
and chloramphenical to an OD6 00 of 0.8 at 37◦ C, induced
with 0.25 mM IPTG, then grown for a further 16 hours at
18◦ C prior to harvesting by centrifugation. Harvested cells
were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5
mM MgCl2 , 10% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
NaN3) plus 1 M NaCl (NFL , N1-364 , N49-419 , N49-364 ) or 500
mM NaCl (all other constructs) and 5 mM imidazole pH 8.0.

For purification, cells were lysed by sonication, then clarified
lysates were loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column (Ni-NTA Superflow; Qiagen), washed in buffer A plus 300 mM NaCl and
20 mM imidazole pH 8.0, and eluted in buffer A plus 300
mM NaCl and 400 mM imidazole. For cleavage of His6 tags, proteins were buffer exchanged in centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Ultra, EMD Millipore) to buffer A plus 300
mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, then incubated 16 hours
at 4◦ C with TEV protease. Cleavage reactions were passed
through a Ni2+ affinity column again to remove uncleaved
protein, cleaved His6 -tags, and His6 -tagged TEV protease.
Proteins were concentrated in centrifugal concentrators and
purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superpose 6 Increase 10/300 GL or Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL; GE
Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 , 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT).
Purified proteins were concentrated and stored at 4◦ C for
analysis.
For fluorescent labeling, we inserted a cysteine residue between the N-terminal His6 -tag and the N-terminal residue
of the full-length N protein, and purified the protein as
above. We labeled with either Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo
Fisher) or sulfo-Cyanine 5 (Lumiprobe) according to Lumiprobe’s protocol “Maleimide labeling of proteins and other
thiolated biomolecules”. Briefly, an excess of TCEP (triscarboxyethylphosphine, up to 100x molar) was added to protein between 1-10 mg/mL, and kept the mixture for 20 minutes at room temperature, then added 1/20 x fold dye solution, mixed well and left overnight at 4◦ C. Next day, proteins
were separated from unreacted fluorophores by passing over
a Superpose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).
In vitro transcription. DNA templates for viral RNA fragments were ordered as gBlocks from IDT and amplified by
PCR through primers with T7 promoter sequence (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAG) in the 5’ end. Genomic RNA
fragments (Table S1) were synthesized following the protocol
of HiScribe T7 high yield RNA synthesis kit (NEB, E2040S)
with 1 µg purified PCR products. To label RNA, 0.1 µL of
10 mM Cy3-UTP (Enzolifesciences, 42506) was added to
the transcription system. After DNase I treatment, RNAs
were purified using Trizol/Chloroform isolation method and
solubilized with 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 RNase-free buffer.
The size and purity of RNAs were verified by denaturing
Urea/PAGE, and their concentrations measured by Nanodrop.
In vitro phase separation assays. In vitro phase separation assays are performed at 20◦ C unless otherwise indicated.
N protein mixed with Cy5-labeled or Alexa-488 labeled protein at 1:100 or 1:10 ratio was used for phase separation assay. Phase separation of N protein (in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,
80 mM KCl) was induced by either adding of RNA (in 5 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5) or M protein (in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 80
mM KCl). Samples were mixed in protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, 022431064) and then immediately transferred onto
18-well glass bottom chamber slide (iBidi, 81817). Condensates were imaged within 10-20 mins or otherwise as indicated in the experiment.

Turbidity assay. Samples were mixed in protein LoBind
tubes as in the previous section. After 30 mins, the turbidity of each sample was measured by nanodrop at 350 nm absorbance.
Stable human cell line construction. For expression in

U2OS cells, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was cloned into a
third-generation Tet-on system on a lentivirus vector with
a Clover tag at the C-terminal of N protein. Lentivirus is
produced in HEK293t cells by transfection of lentiviral plasmid and packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2. After
two days of transfection, the culture medium containing the
lentivirus was passed through a 0.45 µm filter and was used
to infect U2OS cell line. After two days of infection, the
medium is exchanged to medium containing 20 µg/µL blasticidin for selection.
Microscopy of in vitro phase separated condensates.

DIC and fluorescence images of in vitro condensates were
taken on a DeltaVision Elite (GE Healthcare) microscope
with a 60x oil N.A. 1.42 objective. The laser power and exposure time of each channel are optimized to avoid saturation.
Alternatively, condensates were imaged using Zeiss LSM880
or Leica SP8 STED superresolution confocal microscopes.
Laser power for imaging, digital offset and gain values are
optimized for each channel to ensure the intensity lies in the
linear range. For STED superresolution imaging, image resolution settings are optimized to reach ∼20 nm/pixels; average
of the intensity from 16 images to increase the signal to noise
ratio; 50% of 775 nm STED depletion laser is used for STED
imaging. Time lapse imaging was used to capture fusion of
RNA/N protein condensates on a DeltaVision microscope at
1 min intervals.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).

FRAP analysis of condensates in vitro was performed on a
Zeiss LSM880 Aryscan microscope with 63x/1.42 oil objective or 40x/1.2 W objective or on Nikon Eclipse Ti2 A1 confocal microscope as indicated. The intensity of the fluorescent signal is controlled in the detection range through changing the laser power, digital gain and off-set. For green, red
and far-red fluorescent channels, bleaching was conducted
by 488-nm, 561-nm or 633-nm line correspondingly and the
laser power and iteration of bleaching are optimized to get an
efficient bleaching effect. Fluorescence recovery was monitored at 2 s or 4 s intervals for 4 min. In the focal-bleach
experiment, roughly half (partial bleach) or all (full bleach)
of a condensate was photobleached to determine the molecular mobility with diffuse pool or inside a condensate. U2OS
cells for FRAP experiments were cultured on a 8-well chamber slide (iBidi, 80827) in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermofisher, 15240062). NClover expression was induced for 24
hours by adding 1 µg/mL doxycycline to the culture medium.
FRAP experiment was conducted as for in vitro condensate analysis, using a Zeiss LSM88microscope. The FRAP
data were quantified using ImageJ or Zeiss Zen built-in profile model. The time series of the fluorescence intensity of

condensates were calculated. The intensity of the condensate during the whole experiment was normalized to the one
before bleaching and the intensity of the granule just after
bleaching was normalized to zero. At least 2-10 condensates
per condition were analyzed to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The averaged relative intensity and standard
error were plotted to calculate dynamics.
Cryo-electron tomography. For cryo-electron tomogra-

phy, phase separation was induced by mixing 10 µM N
protein (in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 mM KCl) with 20
ng/µL of the indicated RNA (in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5)
for 0.5-1 minute at 20◦ C. 4 µL of the resulting solution
was deposited on glow-discharged Quantifoil grids (R2/1,
Cu 200-mesh grid, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The
solution on the grid was then blotted using a Vitrobot
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with conditions set to blot force
-10, blot time 2.5-3.5 seconds, and drain time 2 seconds.
After blotting, the grid was immediately plunge-frozen into
liquid ethane/propane mixture (Airgas) cooled to close to
liquid nitrogen temperature. Cryo-electron tomography
(cryo-ET) imaging was performed on a Titan Krios operated
at 300 KeV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a
post-column Quantum energy filter (Gatan). The images
were recorded on a K2 Summit direct detector (Gatan)
in counting mode using SerialEM (64). The tilt-series
were acquired using a dose-symmetric scheme (65) with
a tilt range of ± 60◦ in EFTEM mode with a nominal
magnification of 42,000x-64,000x (pixel sizes at the camera
0.34-0.22 nm), tilt increment: 2-3◦ , and a target defocus
of -3-5 µm. Motion-correction and dose-weighting, using
MotionCor2 (66), was applied to the individual frames of the
tilt-series images. The motion-corrected and dose-weighted
tilt-series images were then aligned in IMOD (67) using
patch-tracking. 3D CTF correction was performed using
novaCTF (68). The weighted back-projection method was
used for the final tomographic reconstruction.
