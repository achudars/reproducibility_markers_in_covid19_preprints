Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented itself as one of the most critical public health
challenges of the century, with SARS-CoV-2 being the third member of the Coronaviridae
family to cause fatal disease in humans. There is currently only one antiviral compound,
remdesivir, that can be used for the treatment of COVID-19. In order to identify additional
potential therapeutics, we investigated the enzymatic proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2
genome. In this study, we focussed on the viral RNA cap methyltransferases, which play a
key role in enabling viral protein translation and facilitating viral escape from the immune
system. We expressed and purified both the guanine-N7 methyltransferase nsp14, and the
nsp16 2’-O-methyltransferase with its activating cofactor, nsp10. We performed an in vitro
high-throughput screen for inhibitors of nsp14 using a custom compound library of over
5,000 pharmaceutical compounds that have previously been characterised in either clinical
or basic research. We identified 4 compounds as potential inhibitors of nsp14, all of which
also show antiviral capacity in a cell based model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three of the 4
compounds also exhibited synergistic effects on viral replication with remdesivir.
Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel respiratory pathogen that is able to infect both animals
and humans, resulting in the disease COVID-19, which was officially declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11th March, 2020 [1]. This is the third
novel zoonotic virus belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus since the start of the 21st
century, after the original SARS-CoV-1 in 2003, and MERS-CoV in 2012 [2]. What sets
SARS-CoV-2 apart from the previous two is its distinctive virulence on an overall population,
as well as its epidemiological dynamics (reviewed in [3]). Therefore, vastly different detection
and containment strategy have been required compared to those that were used
successfully with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks.

SARS-CoV-2 is a membrane enveloped virus with peplomer-forming spike (S) glycoproteins
on its surface, giving it the characteristic “corona” shape when visualised under electronmicroscopy (EM) [4]. The structural components of the virus are highly variable and mutable,
with over 10% of the open reading frame mutations identified between December 2019 to
April 2020 found to occur in the Spike glycoprotein gene alone [5]. The highly mutative
nature of the viral coat therefore poses a problem for producing effective long-term
neutralising antibodies through administration of vaccines, leading to viral strains such as
B1.351 that escape from the immune response [6].
However, the structural proteins of the virus actually only constitute a small part of the
coding capacity of the viral genome, with only 4 out of 29 proteins encoding viral structural
components (Figure 1A) [7]. A pair of very large open reading frames (Orf1a and Orf1ab)
comprise the first two-thirds of the genome. The encoded polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) are
autoproteolytically cleaved into 16 distinct non-structural proteins (nsp), generating the
enzymes and accessory proteins responsible for viral replication once inside a eukaryotic
cell.
Coronavirus RNAs are produced by the viral replicase/transcriptase complex, and are post
transcriptionally capped at the 5’ end with a cap structure similar to endogenous mRNA
caps, which are necessary for efficient translation and RNA stability [8-11]. Crucially, viral
RNA capping has been shown to be essential for the synthesis of viral proteins through
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) recognition [12, 13]. In addition, RNA cap
methylation is also important for ensuring efficient ribosome binding and engagement of the
host translation machinery, as well as avoiding degradation by exoribonucleases [9, 14].
Aside from reduced translational capacity, uncapped RNA also triggers the host innate
immune response leading to the expression of antiviral cytokines, which limit virus
replication and shape adaptive immunity [15]. Other host sensor proteins recognise
incomplete or absent cap RNA structures on viral RNA, and are responsible for the inhibition
of viral translation [16, 17]. Formation of the viral RNA cap structures thus protect the virus

against cell intrinsic antiviral effectors and potentiate the infective potential of the virus. For
these reasons, viral enzymes involved in the capping the viral RNA are promising targets for
antiviral drug development [18-20].
In eukaryotes, these methylated cap structures are added co-transcriptionally upon
transcription by RNA Pol II in the nucleus (reviewed in [21]). Because coronavirus replication
and transcription occur in the cytoplasm, independently of Pol II, the formation of these cap
structures must be catalysed by viral enzymes. Over one-third (6/15) of the coronavirus nsps
are necessary to efficiently cap viral RNAs, which exemplifies the complexity of this process
as well as its importance for the viral lifecycle. Firstly, following RNA synthesis, nsp13
removes the terminal γ-phosphate from the initiating adenosine nucleotide triphosphate
(Figure 1B). Nsp12 then acts as an RNA-guanylyltransferase, generating GpppA-capped
RNA (Figure 1B). Subsequently, nsp14 transfers a methyl group to the N7 position of the
terminal cap guanine forming the m7G cap structure, otherwise known as cap-0. Finally, the
nsp16/nsp10 complex is responsible for 2’-O methylation of the cap ribose to form cap-1,
which is the terminal cap structure on viral RNAs (Figure 1B).
The nsp14 enzyme in SARS-CoV-2, similar to other coronaviruses, carries dual functionality
as both a methyltransferase and a 3’-5’ exoribonuclease. While the exoribonuclease activity
is dependent upon the nsp10 cofactor, this cofactor is not required for the N7-MTase
function in nsp14 [18, 22]. In contrast, the other methyltransferase enzyme, nsp16, which
converts cap-0 to cap-1, requires the presence of nsp10 to act as an allosteric activator to
increase RNA substrate binding affinity [22, 23]. Both nsp14 and nsp16/10 are dependent
upon the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), which acts as the methyl donor for
the respective methylated cap modifications, and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) is the
resulting by-product. Using this property, we adopted a biochemical assay that detects the
conversion of SAM to SAH to measure the relative methyltransferase activity. We then
proceeded to first investigate the in vitro methyltransferase activity of purified nsp14 enzyme,

and screened against a custom library of over 5000 characterised chemical compounds,
with the aim of identifying potential antiviral drugs.
Results
Expression & purification of nsp14
To generate untagged nsp14 we used the His-SUMO tag [24], which can be completely
removed by the SUMO protease, Ulp1. His14-SUMO-nsp14 was expressed in Escherichia
coli cells after induction with IPTG overnight. Clarified cell extract was then passed over a
Ni-NTA column and His14-SUMO-nsp14 was eluted with imidazole (Figure 1C). The His14SUMO tag was cleaved by addition of the Ulp1 (Figure 1C) and was further purified by gel
filtration chromatography, where untagged nsp14 eluted as a single peak (Figure 1D). This
methodology allowed the expression and subsequent purification of nsp14 in high yield.
To ensure that purified nsp14 was functional, we examined the ability of the enzyme to
catalyse methylation of the G(5’)pppG(5’) cap in a capped RNA substrate. Radiolabelled 32PRNA substrate was incubated with nsp14, the viral nsp16 methyltransferase, human CMTR1
(Cap-specific mRNA 2’-O-Methyltransferase 1) and RNMT (RNA Guanine-N7
Methyltransferase) in complex with its activating co-factor RAM (RNMT Activating
Miniprotein). Whilst nsp14 and RNMT-RAM are guanine-N7 methyltransferases that use
GpppG-RNA as a substrate [25], CMTR1 and viral nsp16 are 2’-O-methyltransferases that
utilise previously guanine-N7 methylated me7GpppN-RNA as a substrate. Following
incubation with methyltransferase, RNA substrate was digested with Nuclease-P1, which
digests RNA but leaves RNA cap structures intact. This digested mixture was then analysed
by thin layer chromatography. As expected nsp16 and CMTR1 failed to utilise the GpppGRNA substrate, whereas both viral nsp14 and human RNMT-RAM efficiently methylated the
GpppG-RNA to form me7GpppG-RNA (Figure 2A). To confirm that the methylation was
strictly dependent on the catalytic activity of nsp14 we mutated aspartate 331, which resides
in the catalytic core of nsp14 and is predicted to be essential for methyltransferase activity,
to alanine (D331A). The purified nsp14D331A protein was inactive as a methyltransferase in

this assay (Figure 2B), confirming that the nsp14 of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a
methyltransferase in accordance with the function of nsp14 enzymes from other
coronaviruses [26], and demonstrating that our purified wild-type nsp14 is catalytically
active.
An HTRF based assay for methyltransferase activity
Thin layer chromatography is not amenable to high-throughput screening for nsp14
inhibitors, and therefore we turned to a fluorescence-based readout of methyltransferase
activity. We employed a commercially available homologous time-resolved fluorescence
(HTRF) assay, which monitors the activity of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent
methyltransferases. SAM acts as a methyl donor for methyltransferases, yielding S-adenosyl
homocysteine (SAH) as a final product (Figure 3A, left). The HTRF assay revolves around a
Terbium (Tb) cryptate conjugated to the Fc region of an anti-SAH antibody. This antibody is
able to bind SAH which has been conjugated to the d2 fluorophore (SAH-d2) through its
variable (Fab) region. In a system without newly produced SAH, the Tb cryptate is able to
form a FRET pair with the d2 fluorophore present on the bound SAH-d2 (Figure 3A, right
upper). The production of SAH from successful methyltransferase reactions competes with
and displaces SAH-d2 from the variable region of the antibody, causing a reduction in signal
(Figure 3A, right lower).
A robust reduction in HTRF signal was seen after incubation of nsp14, SAM and GpppARNA, which was lost if any one of the three components necessary for methyltransfer was
omitted (Figure 3B). SAM dependent methyltransferases are susceptible to inhibition by
sinefungin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor (with respect to SAM) of
methyltransferases. Figure 3B shows that sinefungin inhibited nsp14 activity in a dosedependent manner. Monitoring over time, the reaction reaches a plateau after around 20 min
(Figure 3C). This plateau is unlikely to be due to time-dependent enzyme inactivation since
we observed a shallow but continuous decrease of HTRF signal over the course of a 45minute reaction in the presence of sinefungin (Figure 3C). Therefore, the rapid plateau

reached likely represents a lower boundary for the HTRF assay under our experimental
conditions.
We next characterised the range of substrates that nsp14 is capable of methylating. Unlike
other guanine-N7 methyltransferases, coronavirus nsp14 has previously been reported to be
able to methylate free GpppA cap analogue without attached RNA, as well as free
nucleotide GTP [25]. When titrating GpppA-capped RNA, GpppA cap analogue, or
nucleotide GTP, we were able to see a reduction in HTRF signal, indicating that SARS-CoV2 nsp14 retains this unusually broad substrate repertoire, and is able to catalyse
methyltransfer to all three substrates (Figure 4A). nsp14 is, however, unable to catalyse
methyltransfer to already guanine-N7 methylated me7GpppA cap analogue (Figure 4A). This
suggests that, despite wide substrate specificity, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 acts specifically as a
guanine-N7 directed methyltransferase. Following this, we were able to quantify the
Michaelis constants (Km) for all of the known substrates of the nsp14 methyltransferase.
nsp14 showed similar Km values for both GpppA and GpppA-RNA substrates (Figure 4B,C),
but demonstrated slightly reduced affinity towards nucleotide GTP (Figure 4D).
Primary identification of nsp14 inhibitors
Next, we adapted the HTRF assay conditions to conduct a high-throughput screen against a
custom compound library to discover novel nsp14 inhibitors. Primary screening for inhibitors
of nsp14 was conducted using a custom compound library containing over 5000 compounds
at a concentration of 3.125 μM. Given that nsp14 showed similar Km values between the
GpppA-RNA substrate and GpppA cap analogue, we conducted the screen using the cap
analogue substrate which did not add the complications of working with an RNA substrate.
Library compounds were resuspended in DMSO, and negative controls wells also included
DMSO to a final concentration of 0.03125 % (v/v). Sinefungin at 3.125 μM was included in
several wells on each plate to serve as a positive control, thereby allowing determination of
screen quality.

After screening, we calculated the Z’ factor of our screen to be 0.625, indicating a highquality screen (Figure S1). We therefore calculated Z-scores for all compounds, and ranked
them by increasing Z-score (Figure 5A). We firstly selected ‘hit’ compounds from the list of
compounds with a Z-score of above 3.0, but made exceptions for some compounds if their
Z-score was >2.5 and either clinically relevant, or a previously characterised
methyltransferase inhibitor. This left 83 compounds, which was narrowed by removing
compounds which likely represented screening errors (see methods), resulting in a list of 63
hits. These hits, and their associated Z-scores, are listed in Table S1. We subsequently
selected compounds to take forward for validation based on if they were available to
purchase commercially, if they were rapidly available, if they were known to be tolerated in
humans, and favoured particularly those that were already licenced therapeutics. This was
done to focus our hits to compounds that may be of clinical relevance to the treatment of
COVID-19, and resulted in a list of 15 compounds to carry forward for validation (Table S1).
Using the HTRF-based assay, we found that 4 of these 15 compounds (PF-03882845,
Inauhzin, Lomeguatrib, and Trifluperidol) consistently inhibited nsp14 when assayed
individually over a wider range of concentrations (Figure 5B and S2). Among these
compounds, PF-03882845 was the most potent inhibitor (HTRF50 = 1.1 μM), followed by
Trifluperidol (HTRF50 = 12.9 μM), Inauhzin (HTRF50 = 23.0 μM), and finally Lomeguatrib
(HTRF50 = 59.8 μM). The remaining 11 compounds did not show significant inhibition, and
were excluded from further analysis (Figure S2, Table S1).
To test the specificity of the four validated compounds towards nsp14 methyltransferase
activity, we checked for cross-inhibition of the other viral methyltransferase nsp16/nsp10. To
test the role of these 4 compounds on the nsp16 methyltransferase activity, we purified
nsp16 fused to its cofactor nsp10. Fusion of nsp14 to its cofactor nsp10 has been shown an
effective strategy to obtain active recombinant nsp14 exonuclease (Canal et al, this issue).
Following this strategy, we decided to fuse the methyltransferase nsp16 with its cofactor
nsp10 that, similarly to for nsp14, would ensure stoichiometric expression of both subunits

as well as their association. In the nsp10-16 fusion protein, nsp10 was placed in the Nterminus followed by the linker GSGSGS and nsp16, and the protein was purified using an
N-terminus His14-SUMO tag. We purified the nsp10-16 fusion protein to homogeneity from E.
coli cells in a manner similar to nsp14 (Figure 6A, see methods). We then confirmed that the
nsp10-16 fusion 2’-O-methyltransferase was able to give a dose-dependent reduction in
HTRF signal when catalysing methyltransfer to its endogenous substrate me7GpppA-RNA
(Figure 6B). Nsp10-16 was able to methylate me7GpppA-RNA efficiently at substantially
lower substrate concentrations than nsp14, and demonstrated a Km value ~100x lower for
me7GpppA-RNA than nsp14 for GpppA-RNA (Figure 6C). Finally, we then used the nsp1016 methyltransferase assay to test specificity of our 4 validated compounds towards the
inhibition of nsp14 methyltransferase activity. When using this assay, none of the nsp14
inhibitors were able to inhibit nsp10-16, however, the SAM-competitor sinefungin was able to
inhibit methyltransfer by nsp10-16 (Figure 6D). Therefore, all four compounds appear to be
specific inhibitors of nsp14 methyltransferase.

Nsp14 inhibitors show antiviral activity in cellular infection models
In order to check if our compounds identified in vitro had any inhibitory effects on viral
replication in mammalian cells, we utilised a SARS-CoV-2 viral infection assay using VERO
E6 cells that are a model cell line for viral infection assays. We assayed viral replicative
capacity by infecting cells with a constant amount of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of
inhibitor. We then quantified viral replicative capacity in fixed cells 22 hours post-infection
using a fluorescent anti-Nucleoprotein antibody. This method allows the co-determination of
cell viability through DNA staining, and ensures that our compounds were not reducing viral
load through cytotoxicity rather than inhibiting viral replication (Figure 7A).
All four compounds showed antiviral activity at or below 80 μM, with limited cytotoxic effects
(Figure 7B). The most effective compounds were PF-03882845 (EC50 = 10.97 μM), Inauhzin
(EC50 = 12.96 μM) and Trifluperidol (EC50 = 14.9 μM). Lomeguatrib was less effective at

inhibiting viral replication, with an EC50 = 59.84 μM. Concentrations at which Lomeguatrib
was effective also came with slight cytotoxicity, whereas all three of PF-03882845, Inauhzin,
and Trifluperidol show little to no cytotoxicity at their EC50 concentrations (Figure 7C). This
establishes that the compounds we identified in vitro have antiviral activity in mammalian
cells with limited cytotoxic effects.
At the moment, remdesivir is the only antiviral compound that can be taken both
prophylactically and therapeutically for the treatment of COVID-19. Other treatments for
COVID-19 are solely therapeutics that either modulate the immune response (such as
dexamethasone) or are antibody-based therapeutics (such as bamlanivimab). Combination
therapy, the use of two or more drugs with different modes of action, is a tested therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of some diseases. In addition to achieving better physiological
outcomes, combination therapies may also be an effective strategy for limiting antiviral drug
resistance [27]. Therefore, we wished to see if the identified compounds from our screen
demonstrated synergistic effects with remdesivir, which might warrant exploration for
combination therapies and prophylaxis.
Although remdesivir is effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in cellular models, it is
known that remdesivir has limited capacity to reduce viral titre in VERO E6 cells at 1 μM and
below (Figure 8A) (25). Therefore, we conducted similar viral infection assays as described
previously, but in additional presence of remdesivir at a concentration of 0.5 μM (Figure 8B).
Inauhzin demonstrated similar IC50 values in the presence of remdesivir (Inauhzin
EC50+Rem = 11.25 μM) (Figure 8C). However, PF-03882845, Trifluperidol, and Lomeguatrib
showed markedly reduced IC50 values in the presence of remdesivir, with values falling close
to a factor of 3 for the two former compounds (PF-03882845 EC50+Rem. = 4.79 μM;
Trifluperidol EC50+Rem.= 5.05 μM Lomeguatrib EC50+Rem. = 44.14 μM), indicating a
potential synergy between our identified nsp14 inhibitors and remdesivir (Figure 8C).

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA methyltransferases have been somewhat overlooked as a
therapeutic target, currently with no characterised inhibitors in vitro or in vivo. Here we
describe the purification and characterisation of both RNA cap methyltransferases encoded
by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In addition, we describe the successful discovery of novel
inhibitors of nsp14 methyltransferase activity in vitro, which are not only effective in cellbased assays at low micromolar concentration, but demonstrate synergy with the only
approved SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic, remdesivir. We show for the first time that SARS-Cov-2
nsp14 in vitro inhibitors are effective at cessation of viral replication, strongly suggesting that
the methyltransferase activity of nsp14 is essential for coronavirus replication.
We initially demonstrated that a commercially available HTRF assay was able to detect the
methyltransferase activity of both nsp14 and an nsp10-16 fusion protein. This level of
quantitation allowed us to accurately determine the Km values of nsp14 against: GTP, free
GpppA, and GpppA-capped RNA; as well as the Km for me7GpppA-RNA for nsp10-16. This
revealed that whilst nsp14 preserved the ability to methylate guanine without need for the
complete cap structure or attached RNA, that the Km values for these substrates are
significantly (~100x) higher than the Km of me7GpppA-RNA for nsp10-16. Thus, it appears
that nsp14 is able to methylate a broad variety of substrates at the expense of a higher Km,
whereas nsp10-16 has a lower Km but is known to only methylate capped RNAs [28].
We identified and validated four antiviral compounds that were potential inhibitors of nsp14
methyltransferase activity. Of these compounds, Lomeguatrib and PF-03882845 have
previously been evaluated in phase II trials for the treatment of melanoma and diabetic
nephropathy, respectively [29, 30]. Lomeguatrib is an inhibitor of the O-6’-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase [31], MGMT (IC50 ~ 5 nM), whereas PF-03882845 is a
mineralocorticoid receptor agonist (IC50 ~ 10 nM) [32]. Although neither compounds were
carried forward for phase III trials, they may be safe for human use. Trifluperidol is a
licenced therapeutic currently in use for the treatment of psychoses including schizophrenia

but has relatively severe side effects that limit its potential use as a prophylactic treatment
for COVID-19, but may warrant its exploration as a post-infection antiviral. Finally, Inauhzin
has previously been characterised as an inhibitor of SIRT1 (IC50 ~ 1 μM) [33], but has not yet
been taken forward into human trials. Although all are able to inhibit nsp14, these
compounds have no obvious common chemical similarities (Figure S3), raising the potential
of multiple inhibitory binding modes that may be exploited to generate future, more potent,
nsp14 inhibitors.
The potency of inhibitors in mammalian cells was similar to the in vitro inhibition of Nsp14 for
Lomeguatrib and Trifluperidol. The efficacy of PF-03882845 was significantly reduced in
cells compared to the biochemical assays, which might suggest issues with cell permeability
or that the drug is actively metabolised into a non-inhibitory form within cells. Inauhzin
presented an interesting result as it appeared to be more potent in cells than in the
biochemical assays. Perhaps Inauhzin, as a sirtuin inhibitor, for example, has other cellular
effects aside from the inhibition of Nsp14 that may contribute to a reduction in viral
infectivity. Although we cannot rule out that inhibition of other cellular pathways might be
contributing to the observed reduction of viral load in cells, aside from the inhibition of
Nsp14, we note that the IC50 values for the known functions of Lomeguatrib, Trifluperidol,
and PF-03882845 are far below the IC50 values for viral load reduction. Therefore, for these
three compounds, it is likely that they exert their effects on reduction of viral load through the
inhibition of Nsp14.
As remdesivir currently stands as the only licenced antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
also tested to see if the nsp14 inhibitors we identified had any synergistic effect with
remdesivir in reducing viral load. This combination treatment approach is commonly used to
treat viral disease, most prominently in the treatment of HIV [34]. Among the four
compounds, three showed synergy with remdesivir (Lomeguatrib, IC50 reduction~27%; PF03884528, IC50 reduction 56%; Trifluperidol IC50 reduction 66%). Only Inauhzin showed no
synergy with remdesivir treatment, perhaps because it exerts an effect via other cellular

targets. The IC50 of Trifluperidol and PF-03884528 was reduced in combination with
remdesivir to a point where they may be clinically relevant. Given that both are apparently
tolerated in humans, using them in combination with remdesivir could be a promising path
for therapeutic exploration.

Experimental Procedures
Protein Expression and Purification
Nsp14
Rosetta™ (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) (F- ompT hsdSB(rB- mB-) gal dcm (DE3) pLysSRARE
(CamR) were transformed with plasmids expressing His14-SUMO-Nsp14 or His14-SUMONsp14-D331A (DU70487 and DU70488; available from https://mrcppu-covid.bio/).
Transformant colonies were inoculated into a 100 ml LB / chloramphenicol (35 µg/ml) culture
(containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.
Next morning, the culture was mixed with 400 ml of LB / chloramphenicol and kanamycin
and further grown until OD600 reached 0.8. The protein expression was induced by 0.05 mM
IPTG addition and the culture was shaken overnight at 18 °C.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min in an JLA-9.1000 rotor
(Beckman). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8), 0.5 M NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 30 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, Roche protease
inhibitor tablets) with 500 µg / ml Lysozyme, then incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h with rotation.
Subsequently, the sample was sonicated twice for 90 s (15 s on, 30 s off) at 40% on a
Branson Digital Sonifier. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4°C for 0.5 h in an JA-30.50
rotor (Beckman), the obtained soluble extract was mixed with 2 ml slurry Ni-NTA beads
(30210, QIAGEN), incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation.
Beads were recovered in a disposable gravity flow column and washed with 150 ml of lysis
buffer then 20 ml lysis buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM ATP (to remove bacterial
chaperones) then 20 ml lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with 4 ml lysis buffer containing
0.4 M imidazole. Subsequently, Ulp1 protease (10 mg/ml [35]) was added to cleave the
HIS14-SUMO tag, incubated overnight at 4 °C. Untagged nsp14 was loaded onto a 120 ml
Superdex 200 column in Gel filtration buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.15 M NaCl, 4
mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP). nsp14-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 2.5

and snap frozen.
Nsp10-16
His-Sumo nsp10-16 fusion constructs were expressed in T7 express lysY/Iq E. coli cell
(NEB). Cells were grown at 37°C to log phase to achieve OD 0.8. Cells were then induced
by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and continued to incubate at 18°C overnight. Cells were
harvested and lysed with in buffer A (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH7.6, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT,
0.02% NP-40, 300 mM NaCl and 30 mM imidazole), with addition of 100 ug/ml lyzsozyme
and sonicate 24x5s. Lysate was centrifuged and supernatant was collected. The
supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads (Thermo) for 1 hr at 4°C. Beads
were wash with wash buffer A. The protein was eluted with 400 mM of imidazole. Fractions
were pooled and dialyzed in buffer B (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH7.6, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT,
0.02% NP-40 and 150 mM NaCl) and 0.02 mg/ml His-Ulp1 to cleave-off the His-Sumo-tag.
The dialysis was collected and incubate with Ni-NTA agarose beads once again to remove
the proteases. The flow through was collected and load on Superdex S200 Increase 10/300
GL (GE healthcare) with buffer B. Peak fractions were collected and pooled.
Substrate generation for nsp14
nsp14 utilises GpppA capped RNA as a substrate. In order to synthesise this substrate RNA
containing the first 30 nt of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (followed by 60 nt of junk RNA) was
synthesised by firstly annealing Oligo_L3
(CAGTAATACGACTCACTATTaGtaaggtttataccttcccaggtaacaacttgcttacccgaatcctatgaatttccta
cgtcgtatctc) and Oligo_L3_Rev
(gagatacgacgtaggaaattcataggattcgggtaagcaagttgttacctgggaaggtataaaccttaCtAATAGTGAGT
CGTATTACTG). One A->G mutation was made in the 30nt region encoding the SARS-CoV2 genome (underlined) to conform to improve transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The
DNA oligos were annealed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl and 1
mM EDTA, heating to 95 oC, before cooling at 1 oC/minute until room temperature. RNA was

co-transcriptionally capped with GpppA cap analogue (New England Biolabs) by using the
HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis (NEB) using all nucleotide triphosphates at 10 mM
except for GTP, which was used at 0.75 mM. GpppA cap analogue was used at 9.25 mM.
The reaction was run at 37 °C for 16 hrs, and purified using Monarch RNA cleanup kits
(NEB).
Substrate generation for nsp16
Oligo_L3_ and oligo_L3_Rev were again annealed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. The template was synthesized using HiScribe t7 Quick
High Yield RNA Synthesis (NEB) at 37 °C for 16 hrs, using all nucleotide triphosphates at 10
mM without any nucleotide substitutions. The synthesized RNA was purified using Monarch
RNA cleanup kits (NEB). Purified RNA was then heated at 65 °C for 5 min to denature the
secondary structure. Purified and denatured RNA was capped using Vaccinia Capping Kit
(NEB) and finally purified using Monarch RNA cleanup kit.
Assays
TLC assay for nsp14 enzymatic activity
The N-7 cap guanosine methylation assay was performed according to Varshney et al. [36].
Briefly, 20ng N14 was incubated with 200nM SAM and a 32P-G-capped substrate at 30C for
5-30 mins. 32P-m7G-capped and G-capped substrates were cleaved with P1 nuclease and
caps resolved by thin layer chromatography on PEI cellulose/0.4M Ammonium sulphate.
Caps were quantitated by phosphor-imaging.
Methyltransferase assay
The methyltransferase activity of nsp14 was assayed by the detection of released SAH from
the methyltransferase reaction. Released SAH was detected through the use of the
commercially available EPIgeneous™ methyltransferase kit (CisBio Bioassays). Individual
kit reagents were reconstituted according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For screening,
the methyltransferase reaction was conducted at room temperature in an 8 μl reaction
volume with 10 nM nsp14, 1 μM Ultrapure SAM (CisBio), 0.14 mM GpppA RNA cap

analogue (New England Biolabs) in reaction buffer consisting of HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150
mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM DTT. The reaction was started with the addition of nsp14 and was
allowed to proceed for 20 minutes before quenching by the addition of 2 μl 5M NaCl to a
final concentration of 1M.
Following quenching, 2 μl Detection Buffer 1 (CisBio) was immediately added to the reaction
mixture. After 10 minutes, 4 μl of 16X SAH-d2 conjugate solution (CisBio) was added. 16X
SAH-d2 was prepared by adding one part SAH-d2 to 15 parts Detection Buffer 2 (CisBio).
After 5 minutes, 4 μl of 1X α-SAH Tb Cryptate antibody solution was added to the reaction
mixture. 1X α-SAH Tb Cryptate antibody solution was prepared by adding one part α-SAH
Tb Cryptate antibody (CisBio) to 49 parts Detection Buffer 2 (CisBio).
Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) measurements were taken after 1 hour
following α-SAH Tb Cryptate antibody addition on a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader.
Readings were taken with a lag time of 60 μs after excitation at λ=337nm. Readings were
taken emission wavelengths of λ=665nm and λ=620nm. The experimental HTRF ratio
(HTRFexp) was then calculated as ratio of emission intensities: λ=665/λ=620. To reach the
normalised HTRF ratio, HTRF ratio measurements were also taken of wells without enzyme
(E0) and without SAH-d2 (d20), representing the maximum and minimum achievable HTRF
values, respectively. The normalised HTRF ratio was then calculated as a linear
transformation of the experimental HTRF ratio, the E0 ratio, and the d20 ratio:

The buffer used for the nsp16 assay was 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH7.6, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM
MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Tween-20, 1.3 mM substrate and 100 nM enzyme, unless
stated otherwise. The inhibitor was pre-incubated with enzyme for 10 min at RT. EPIgenous
Methyltransferase kit (Cisbio Bioassays) was used for the detection of methyltransferase
activity as with nsp14.

High-throughput screening was performed using a custom compound collection assembled
from commercial sources (Sigma, Selleck, Enzo, Tocris, Calbiochem, and Symansis). 2.5 nl
of a 10mM stock of the compounds dissolved in DMSO were arrayed and pre-dispensed into
the assay plates using an Echo 550 (Labcyte), before being sealed and stored at -80C until
screening day. When selecting ‘hit’ compounds, we removed aberrant high Z-scores due to
screening errors. These screening errors arose due to systematic dispensation errors, and
occurred within the same repeated wells, or cluster of wells within the screen. These wells
were either discarded completely from all plates, or hits within these wells were discarded
after the initial Z-score cut-off. This resulted in approximately 1% data loss. The initial Z’
factor to assess screen quality was conducted including these outlier wells, and therefore
provides a conservative estimate of screen quality.
Viral inhibition assay
1.5x103 Vero E6 cells (NIBC, UK) resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS were seeded
into each well of 96-well imaging plates (Greiner 655090) and cultured overnight at 37C and
5% CO2. The next day, a 5x solution of compounds were generated by dispensing 10mM
stocks of compounds into a v-bottom 96-well plate (Thermo 249946) and back filling with
DMSO to equalise the DMSO concentration in all wells using an Echo 550 (Labcyte) before
resuspending in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The assay plates with seeded VERO cells had
the media replaced with 60µl of fresh growth media, then 20µl of the 5x compounds were
stamped into the wells of the assay plates using a Biomek Fx automated liquid handler.
Finally, the cells were infected by adding 20µl of SARS-CoV2 with a final MOI of 0.5
PFU/cell. 22h post infection, cells were fixed, permeabilised, and stained for SARS-CoV2 N
protein using Alexa488-labelled-CR3009 antibody produced custom (see section for
Recombinant mAb production) and cellular DNA using DRAQ7 (ABCAM). Whole-well
imaging at 5x was carried out using an Opera Phenix (Perkin Elmer) and fluorescent areas
and intensity calculated using the Phenix-associated software Harmony (Perkin Elmer).

Heavy and light chain variable regions for CR3009, were synthesized (Genewiz) based on
the GenBank sequences with regions of overlap to restriction digested human IgG1 vectors
for assembly cloning (NEB) to produce plasmids: CR3009HC and CR3001KC. N-protein
specific mAb CR3009 was produced by co-transfecting Expi293F cells (Life Technologies) in
suspension growing at 37oC in 8% CO2 atmosphere in FreeStyle 293T medium (Life
Technologies) with the plasmids. The supernatants were harvested 6-8 days posttransfection. as per the original study describing this mAb (van den Brink et al., 2005). The
CR3009 Mab were purified by affinity chromatography using a 5 ml Protein G column
(Cytiva) attached to an AKTA Pure system. Upon loading, the column was washed with PBS
and bound Mabs eluted with 0.1M glycine pH 2.2 and immediately neutralized with 1M Tris,
pH 8.0. The mAb-containing fractions were pooled and subjected to Size Exclusion
Chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/600 prep grade column. The purified mAb
CR3009 was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488-NHS (Cat#1812 Jena Biosciences) according to
the instructions from the manufacturer.

unlike following RNA bases. The γ phosphate is removed by nsp13, followed by the addition
of Gp by nsp12, releasing pyrophosphate. nsp14 and nsp16/10 then catalyse the formation
of the final Cap-0 structure.
c) Coomassie gel of His14-SUMO cleavage. Left column: Elution from Ni-NTA beads without
the Ulp1 SUMO-dependent protease. Right: Elution from Ni-NTA beads after treatment with
Ulp1 (see Methods).
d) Gel filtration fractions of nsp14. Left: Input to gel filtration. Right: Pooled fractions from the
main peak of the elution (lower). nsp14 expected size: 55 kDa.
Figure 2: Nsp14 is functional as a cap methyltransferase in vitro
a) Nsp14, nsp16, CMRT1, the catalytic domain of CMRT1 (CMRT1-Cat), and RNTM fused
to the first 80 amino acids of RAM were incubated with radiolabelled GpppG-RNA and the
methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine. After the reaction was stopped, RNAs were digested
with Nuclease-P1 and resolved by thin layer chromatography (see methods). A negative
control was also run in which no enzyme was added. Standards were visualized by UV light
to establish correct migration.
b) nsp14 and nsp14D331A were incubated with radiolabelled GpppG as above, with a negative
control given in which no enzyme was added.

Figure 3: An HTRF based assay for methyltransferase activity
a) Outline of the HTRF based assay for methyltransferase activity. Both nsp14 and nsp10-16
are SAM dependent methyltransferases that produce SAH following successful
methyltransfer to their substrate. This SAH displaces SAH-d2 from the variable region of an
α-SAH Tb cryptate-conjugated antibody, thus lowering HTRF signal through the disruption of
the Tb cryptate – d2 FRET pair.
b) nsp14 was assayed for methyltransferase activity through the HTRF based assay. The
methyltransferase reaction was run in either the absence of 10nM nsp14, 1 μM SAM, 0.11
mM GpppA-RNA, or in the presence of all three components. In addition, the
methyltransferase reaction was conducted in the presence of 0.25 μM, 2.5 μM and 25 μM of
the pan-methyltransferase inhibitor Sinefungin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor (with
respect to SAM) towards SAM-dependent methyltransferases.
c) Time course of nsp14 activity by HTRF assay. 20 nM of nsp14 was incubated with 0.11
mM GpppA cap analogue and 1 μM SAM for the time indicated. In addition, an experiment
was run in the absence of nsp14, and in the presence of the methyltransferase inhibitor
sinefungin. The reaction was started as a master mix with the addition of nsp14, and 8 μl
was removed at every time point and added to 2 μl of 5M NaCl to stop the methyltransferase
reaction. Points are the mean of three technical repeats, and error bars indicate range.
Figure 4: Km values for substrates of nsp14
a) Titration of various nsp14 susbstrates. GTP, GpppA cap analogue, GpppA-RNA, and
me7GpppA cap analogue were incubated for 20 minutes with 5 nM nsp14 in the presence of
1 μM SAM.
b-d) Determination of Michaelis constants for (b) GpppA-RNA, (c) GpppA, and (d) GTP for
nsp14. nsp14 concentration was fixed at 5 nM for all experiments, and substrate
concentration varied. Vmax values cannot be compared between substrates, and are
therefore not given. HTRF values are given as raw, and not normalised, HTRF values.
Errors given are 95% confidence ranges.

Figure 5: Screening for inhibitors of nsp14
a) Z-values of all compounds in the high throughput screen. Compounds are ranked by
observed Z-value. Four compounds highlighted were validated in further HTRF experiments.
b) Titration of validated compounds from high throughput screening. Normalised HTRF50
values for each compound are given within the respective panel. Normalised HTRF50 values
are determined from fitting four-parameter agonist vs. response curves (see Methods).
Figure 6: Nsp14 inhibitors do not inhibit nsp10-16
a) Gel filtration from final purification step of the nsp10-16 fusion protein. Coomassie shows
fractions taken across the major peak of the gel filtration elution. Only fractions indicated
were pooled (black bar, upper). Expected size of nsp10-16: 47.8 kDa (nsp10 - 13.3 kDa +
nsp16 - kDa 34.5 kDa)
b) Time course of the nsp10-16 methyltransferase reaction with 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM and
12.5 nM nsp10-16 enzyme. Reaction was conducted with 1.3 μM me7GpppA-RNA and 1 μM
SAM.
c) Determination of Michaelis constants for me7GpppA-RNA for nsp10-16. nsp10-16
concentration was fixed at 100 nM and substrate concentration varied. Errors given are 95%
confidence ranges.
d) Cross validation of nsp14 inhibitors with nsp10-16. Normalised HTRF values for nsp10-16
with inhibitors identified for nsp14 and sinefungin. All compounds tested at 50 μM. Reactions
conducted with 1.3 μM me7GpppA-RNA and 1 μM SAM.
