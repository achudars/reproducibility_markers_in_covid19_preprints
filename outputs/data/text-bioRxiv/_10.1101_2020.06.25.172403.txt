SUMMARY

29

The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus, which utilizes

30

its highly glycosylated trimeric Spike protein to bind to the cell surface receptor ACE2 glycoprotein

31

and facilitate host cell entry. We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-

32

specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer Spike mimetic immunogen

33

and for a soluble version of human ACE2. We combined this information with bioinformatic

34

analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate

35

molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another. Our

36

results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly

37

modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions.

38

evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on

39

ACE2 receptor glycosylation that, taken together, can facilitate immunogen design to achieve

40

antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection.

Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral

INTRODUCTION

57

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, is responsible for the

58

severe acute respiratory syndrome referred to as COVID-19 that was first reported in China in

59

December of 2019 (1). In approximately six months, this betacoronavirus has spread globally

60

with more than 14 million people testing positive worldwide resulting in greater than 600,000

61

deaths as of July 20th, 2020 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

62

coronavirus is highly similar (nearly 80% identical at the genomic level) to SARS-CoV-1, which

63

was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak that began in 2002 (2,3).

64

Furthermore, human SARS-CoV-2 at the whole genome level is >95% identical to a bat

65

coronavirus (RaTG13), the natural reservoir host for multiple coronaviruses (1,4,5). Given the

66

rapid appearance and spread of this virus, there is no current validated vaccine or SARS-CoV-2-

67

specific targeting therapy clinically approved although statins, heparin, and steroids look

68

promising for lowering fatality rates and antivirals likely reduce the duration of symptomatic

69

disease presentation (6-12).

70

SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV-1, utilizes the host angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) for

71

binding and entry into host cells (13,14). Like many viruses, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a Spike

72

glycoprotein trimer for recognition and binding to the host cell entry receptor and for membrane

73

fusion (15). Given the importance of viral Spike proteins for targeting and entry into host cells

74

along with their location on the viral surface, Spike proteins are often used as immunogens for

75

vaccines to generate neutralizing antibodies and frequently targeted for inhibition by small

76

molecules that might block host receptor binding and/or membrane fusion (15,16). In similar

77

fashion, wildtype or catalytically-impaired ACE2 has also been investigated as a potential

78

therapeutic biologic that might interfere with the infection cycle of ACE2 targeting coronaviruses

79

(17,18). Thus, a detailed understanding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding to ACE2 is critical for

80

elucidating mechanisms of viral binding and entry, as well as for undertaking the rational design

81

of effective therapeutics.

82

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein consists of two subunits, a receptor binding subunit (S1)

83

and a membrane fusion subunit (S2) (1,2).

84

homotrimers that together possess 66 canonical sequons for N-linked glycosylation (N-X-S/T,

85

where X is any amino acid except P) as well as a number of potential O-linked glycosylation sites

86

(19,20). Interestingly, coronaviruses virions bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-

87

Golgi intermediate compartment, ERGIC, raising unanswered questions regarding the precise

88

mechanisms by which viral surface glycoproteins are processed as they traverse the secretory

89

pathway (21,22). While this and similar studies (19,23) analyze recombinant proteins, a previous

90

study on

91

intracellular budding and remains to be investigated in SARS-CoV-2 (24). Nonetheless, it has

92

been proposed that this virus, and others, acquires a glycan coat sufficient and similar enough to

93

endogenous host protein glycosylation that it serves as a glycan shield, facilitating immune

94

evasion by masking non-self viral peptides with self-glycans (15,20-22). In parallel with their

95

potential masking functions, glycan-dependent epitopes can elicit specific, even neutralizing,

96

antibody

97

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.178897v1).

98

glycosylation of the viral Spike trimer is fundamental for the development of efficacious vaccines,

99

neutralizing antibodies, and therapeutic inhibitors of infection.

100

ACE2 is an integral membrane metalloproteinase that regulates the renin-angiotensin system

101

(30). Both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have co-opted ACE2 to function as the receptor by

102

which these viruses attach and fuse with host cells (13,14). ACE2 is cleavable by ADAM

103

proteases at the cell surface (31), resulting in the shedding of a soluble ectodomain which can be

104

detected in apical secretions of various epithelial layers (gastric, airway, etc.) and in serum (32).

105

The N-terminal extracellular domain of ACE2 contains 6 canonical sequons for N-linked

106

glycosylation and several potential O-linked sites. Several nonsynonymous single-nucleotide

107

polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ACE2 gene have been identified in the human population and could

108

potentially alter ACE2 glycosylation and/or affinity of the receptor for the viral Spike protein (33).

109

Given that glycosylation can affect the half-life of circulating glycoproteins in addition to

110

modulating the affinity of their interactions with receptors and immune/inflammatory signaling

111

pathways (34,35), understanding the impact of glycosylation of ACE2 with respect to its binding

112

of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein is of high importance.

113

extracellular domains of ACE2 as decoy, competitive inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 infection

114

emphasizes the critical need for understanding the glycosylation profile of ACE2 so that optimally

115

active biologics can be produced (17,18).

116

To accomplish the task of characterizing site-specific glycosylation of the trimer Spike of SARS-

117

CoV-2 and the host receptor ACE2, we began by expressing and purifying a stabilized, soluble

118

trimer Spike glycoprotein mimetic immunogen (that we define here and forward as S, (36)) and a

119

soluble version of the ACE2 glycoprotein from a human cell line. We utilized multiple mass

120

spectrometry-based approaches, including glycomic and glycoproteomic approaches, to

121

determine occupancy and site-specific heterogeneity of N-linked glycans. Occupancy (i.e. the

122

percent of any given residue being modified by a glycan) is an important consideration when

123

developing neutralizing antibodies against a glycan-dependent epitope. We also identified sites

124

of O-linked glycosylation and the heterogeneity of the O-linked glycans on S and ACE2. We

125

leveraged this rich dataset, along with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins, to generate

126

static and molecular dynamics models of S alone, and in complex with the glycosylated, soluble

127

ACE 2 receptor. By combining bioinformatic characterization of viral evolution and variants of the

128

Spike and ACE2 with molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated Spike-ACE2 interaction,

129

we identified important roles for glycans in multiple processes, including receptor-viral binding

130

and glycan-shielding of the Spike. Our rich characterization of the recombinant, glycosylated

131

Spike trimer mimetic immunogen of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with the soluble human ACE2

132

receptor provides a detailed platform for guiding rational vaccine, antibody, and inhibitor design.

140

141

confirmed by negative EM staining for the S trimer (Fig. 1B) and purity examined by SDS-PAGE

142

Coomassie G-250 stained gels for both (Fig. 1C). In addition, proteolytic digestions followed by

143

proteomic analyses confirmed that the proteins were highly purified (Supplemental Table, Tab

144

12). Finally, the N-terminus of both the mature S and the soluble mature ACE2 were empirically

145

determined via proteolytic digestions and LC-MS/MS analyses. These results confirmed that both

146

the secreted, mature forms of S protein and ACE2 begin with an N-terminal glutamine that has

147

undergone condensation to form pyroglutamine at residue 14 and 18, respectively (Figs. 1D and

148

S1). The N-terminal peptide observed for S also contains a glycan at Asn-0017 (Fig. 1D) and

149

mass spectrometry analysis of non-reducing proteolytic digestions confirmed that Cys-0015 of S

150

is in a disulfide linkage with Cys-0136 (Fig. S2, Supplemental Table, Tab 2). Given that SignalP

151

(37) predicts signal sequence cleavage between Cys-0015 and Val-0016 but we observed

152

cleavage between Ser-0013 and Gln-0014, we examined the possibility that an in-frame upstream

153

Methionine to the proposed start Methionine (Fig. 1A) might be used to initiate translation (Fig.

154

S3). If one examines the predicted signal sequence cleavage using the in-frame Met that is

155

encoded 9 amino acids upstream, SignalP now predicts cleavage between the Ser and Gln that

156

we observed in our studies (Fig. S3). To examine whether this impacted S expression, we

157

expressed constructs that contained or did not contain the upstream 27 nucleotides in a

158

pseudovirus (VSV) system expressing SARS-CoV2 S (Fig. S4) and in our HEK293 system (data

Glycomics Informed Glycoproteomics Reveals Site-Specific Microheterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2

164

S Glycosylation

165

We utilized multiple approaches to examine glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer. First, the

166

portfolio of glycans linked to SARS-CoV-2 S trimer immunogen was analyzed following their

167

release from the polypeptide backbone. N-glycans were released from protein by treatment with

168

PNGase F and O-glycans were subsequently released by beta-elimination.

169

permethylation to enhance detection sensitivity and structural characterization, released glycans

170

were analyzed by multi-stage mass spectrometry (MSn) (38,39). Mass spectra were processed

171

by GRITS Toolbox and the resulting annotations were validated manually (40). Glycan

172

assignments were grouped by type and by additional structural features for relative quantification

173

of profile characteristics (Fig. 2A, Supplemental Table, Tab 3). This analysis quantified 49 N-

174

glycans and revealed that 55% of the total glycan abundance was of the complex type, 17% was

175

of the hybrid type, and 28% was high-mannose. Among the complex and hybrid N-glycans, we

176

observed a high degree of core fucosylation and significant abundance of bisected and LacDiNAc

177

structures. We also observed sulfated N-linked glycans using negative mode MSn analyses

178

(Supplemental Table, Tab 13) though signal intensity was too low in positive ion mode (at least

179

10-fold lower than any of the non-sulfated glycans) for accurate quantification. In addition, we

180

detected 15 O-glycans released from the S trimer (Fig. S5, Supplemental Table, Tab 4).

181

To determine occupancy of N-linked glycans at each site, we employed a sequential

182

deglycoslyation approach using Endoglycosidase H and PNGase F in the presence of

183

following tryptic digestion of S (28,41). Following LC-MS/MS analyses, the resulting data

184

confirmed that 19 of the canonical sequons had occupancies greater than 95% (Supplemental

185

Table, Tab 5). One canonical sequence, N0149, had insufficient spectral counts for quantification

186

by this method but subsequent analyses described below suggested high occupancy. The 2 most

187

C-terminal N-linked sites, N1173 and N1194, had reduced occupancy, 52% and 82% respectively.

188

Reduced occupancy at these sites may reflect hindered en-bloc transfer by the

189

oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) due to primary amino acid sequences at or near the N-linked

190

sequon.

191

release of the protein by the ribosome by a less efficient STT3B-containing OST, either due to

192

activity or initial folding of the polypeptide, as opposed to co-translationally modified by the

193

STT3A-containing OST (42). None of the non-canoncial sequons (3 N-X-C sites and 4 N-G-L/I/V

194

sites, (43)) showed significant occupancy (>5%) except for N0501 that showed moderate (19%)

195

conversion to

196

position (Supplemental Table, Tab 5, (44)). Further analysis of this site (see below) by direct

197

glycopeptide analyses allowed us to determine that N0501 undergoes deamidation but is not

198

glycosylated. Thus, all, and only the, 22 canonical sequences for N-linked glycosylation (N-X-S/T)

199

are utilized with only N1173 and N1194 demonstrating occupancies below 95%.

200

Next, we applied 3 different proteolytic digestion strategies to the SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen to

201

maximize glycopeptide coverage by subsequent LC-MS/MS analyses.

202

nanoflow reverse-phase LC-MS/MS was carried out on a ThermoFisher Lumos™ Tribrid™

203

instrument using Step-HCD fragmentation on each of the samples (see STAR methods for details,

204

(25,26,28,41,45)). Following data analyses using pGlyco 2.2.2 (46), Byonic (47), and manual

205

validation of glycan compositions against our released glycomics findings (Fig. 2A,

206

Supplemental Table, Tab 3 and 13), we were able to determine the microheterogeneity at each

207

of the 22 canonical sites (Fig. 2B-2E, Supplemental Table, Tab 6). Notably, none of the non-

208

canonical consensus sequences, including N0501, displayed any quantifiable glycans. The N-

209

glycosites N0074 (Fig. 2B) and N0149 (Fig. 2C) are highly processed and display a typical

210

mammalian N-glycan profile. N0149 is, however, modified with several hybrid N-glycan structures

211

while N0074 is not. N0234 (Fig. 2D) and N0801 (Fig. 2E) have N-glycan profiles more similar to

212

those found on other viruses such as HIV (15) that are dominated by high-mannose structures.

213

N0234 (Fig. 2D) displays an abundance of Man7 - Man9 high-mannose structures suggesting

214

stalled processing by early acting ER and cis-Golgi mannosidases. In contrast, N0801 (Fig. 2E)

is processed more efficiently to Man5 high-mannose and hybrid structures suggesting that access

216

to the glycan at this site by MGAT1 and a-Mannosidase II is hindered. In general, for all 22 sites

217

(Fig. 2B-2E, Supplemental Table, Tab 6), we observed under processing of complex glycan

218

antennae (i.e. under-galactosylation and under-sialylation) and a high degree of core fucosylation

219

in agreement with released glycan analyses (Fig. 2A, Supplemental Table, Tab 3). We also

220

observed a small percent of sulfated N-linked glycans at several sites (Supplemental Table, Tab

221

6 and 8). Based on the assignments and the spectral counts for each topology, we were able to

222

determine the percent of total N-linked glycan types (high-mannose, hybrid, or complex) present

223

at each site (Figure 3, Supplemental Table, Tab 7). Notably, 3 of the sites (N0234, N0709, and

224

N0717) displayed more than 50% high-mannose glycans while 11 other sites (N0017, N0074,

225

N0149, N0165, N0282, N0331, N0657, N1134, N1158, N1173, and N1194) were more than 90%

226

complex when occupied. The other 8 sites were distributed between these 2 extremes. Notably,

227

only 1 site (N0717 at 45%), which also had greater than 50% high-mannose (55%), had greater

228

than 33% hybrid structures. To further evaluate the heterogeneity, we grouped all the topologies

229

into the 20 classes recently described by the Crispin laboratory with adding 2 categories (sulfated

230

and unoccupied) that we refer to here as the Oxford classification (Supplemental Table, Tab 8,

231

(19)). Among other features observed, this classification allowed us to observe that while most

232

sites with high mannose structures were dominated by the Man5GlcNAc2 structure, N0234 and

233

N0717 were dominated by the higher Man structures of Man8GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2,

234

respectively (Fig. S7, Supplemental Table, Tab 8). Limited processing at N0234 is in agreement

235

with a recent report suggesting that high mannose structures at this site help to stabilize the

236

receptor-binding

237

Furthermore, applying the Oxford classifications to our dataset clearly demonstrates that the 3

238

most C-terminal sites (N1158, N1173, and N1194), dominated by complex type glycans, were

239

more often further processed (i.e. multiple antennae) and elaborated (i.e. galactosylation and

240

sialylation) than other sites (Supplemental Table, Tab 8).

We also analyzed our generated mass spectrometry data for the presence of O-linked glycans

242

based on our glycomic findings (Fig. S5, Supplemental Table, Tab 4) and a recent manuscript

243

suggesting significant levels of O-glycosylation of S1 and S2 when expressed independently (23).

244

We were able to confirm sites of O-glycan modification with microheterogeneity observed for the

245

vast majority of these sites (Supplemental Table, Tab 9). However, occupancy at each site,

246

determined by spectral counts, was observed to be very low (below 4%) except for Thr0323 that

247

had a modestly higher but still low 11% occupancy (Fig. S6, Supplemental Table, Tab 10).

3D Structural Modeling of Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Trimer Immunogen Enables Predictions of

249

Epitope Accessibility and Other Key Features

250

A 3D structure of the S trimer was generated using a homology model of the S trimer described

251

previously (based on PDB code 6VSB, (48)). Onto this 3D structure, we installed explicitly defined

252

glycans at each glycosylated sequon based on one of three separate sets of criteria, thereby

253

generating three different glycoform models for comparison that we denote as “Abundance,”

254

“Oxford Class,” and “Processed” models (see Methods and Supplemental Table, Tab 1). These

255

criteria were chosen in order to generate glycoform models that represent reasonable

256

expectations for glycosylation microheterogeneity and integrate cross-validating glycomic and

257

glycoproteomic characterization of S and ACE2.

258

The three glycoform models were subjected to multiple all atom MD simulations with explicit

259

water. Information from analyses of these structures is presented in Figure 4A along with the

260

sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S protomer. We also determined variants in S that are emerging in

the virus that have been sequenced to date (Supplemental Table, Tab 11). The inter-residue

262

distances were measured between the most a-carbon-distal atoms of the N-glycan sites and

263

Spike glycoprotein population variant sites in 3D space (Figure 4B). Notable from this analysis,

264

there are several variants that don’t ablate the N-linked sequon, but that are sufficiently close in

265

3-dimensional space to N-glycosites, such as D138H, H655Y, S939F, and L1203F, to warrant

266

further investigation.

267

The percentage of simulation time that each S protein residue is accessible to a probe that

268

approximates the size of an antibody variable domain was calculated for a model of the S trimer

269

using the Abundance glycoforms (Supplemental Table, Tab 1, (49)). The predicted antibody

270

accessibility is visualized across the sequence, as well as mapped onto the 3D surface, via color

271

shading (Figure 4A, 4C, Supplemental Table, Tab 13, and Supplemental Movie A).

272

Additionally, the Oxford Class glycoforms model (Supplemental Table, Tab 1), which is arguably

273

the most encompassing means for representing glycan microheterogeneity since it captures

274

abundant structural topologies (Supplemental Table, Tab 8), is shown with the sequence variant

275

information (Figure 4D, Supplemental Table, Tab 11). A substantial number of these variants

276

occur (directly by comparison to Figure 4A or visually by comparison to Figure 4C) in regions of

277

high calculated epitope accessibility (e.g. N74K, T76I, R78M, D138H, H146Y, S151I, D253G,

278

V483A, etc., Supplemental Table, Tab 14) suggesting potential selective pressure to avoid host

279

immune response. Also, it is interesting to note that 3 of the emerging variants would eliminate

280

N-linked sequons in S; N74K and T76I would eliminate N-glycosylation of N74 (found in the insert

281

variable region 1 of CoV-2 S compared to CoV-1 S), and S151I eliminates N-glycosylation of

282

N149 (found in the insert variable region 2) (Fig. 4A, S7, Supplemental Table, Tab 11). Lastly,

283

the SARS-CoV-2 S Processed glycoform model is shown (Supplemental Table, Tab 1), along

284

with marking amino acid T0323 that has a modest (11% occupancy, Fig. S6, Supplemental

285

Table, Tab 10) amount of O-glycosylation to represent the most heavily glycosylated form of S

286

(Figure 4E).

Glycomics Informed Glycoproteomics Reveals Complex N-linked Glycosylation of ACE2

288

We also analyzed ACE2 glycosylation utilizing the same glycomic and glycoproteomic

289

approaches described for S protein. Glycomic analyses of released N-linked glycans (Fig. 5A,

290

Supplemental Table, Tab 3) revealed that the majority of glycans on ACE2 are complex with

291

limited high-mannose and hybrid glycans and we were unable to detect sulfated N-linked glycans.

292

Glycoproteomic analyses revealed that occupancy was high (>75%) at all 6 sites and significant

293

microheterogeneity dominated by complex N-glycans was observed for each site (Fig. 5B-5G,

294

Supplemental Table, Tabs 5-8). We also observed, consistent with the O-glycomics (Fig. S5,

295

Supplemental Table, Tab 4), that Ser 155 and several S/T residues at the C-terminus of ACE2

296

outside of the peptidase domain were O-glycosylated but stoichiometry was extremely low (less

297

than 2%, Supplemental Table, Tab 9 and 10).

3D Structural Modeling of Glycosylated, Soluble, ACE2 Highlighting Glycosylation and Variants.

299

We integrated our glycomics, glycoproteomics, and population variant analyses results with a 3D

300

model of Ace 2 (based on PDB code 6M0J (50), see methods for details) to generate two versions

301

of the soluble glycosylated ACE2 for visualization and molecular dynamics simulations. We

302

visualized the ACE2 glycoprotein with the Abundance glycoform model simulated at each site as

303

well as highlighting the naturally occurring variants observed in the human population (Fig. 6A,

304

Supplemental Movie B, Supplemental Table, Tab 11). Note, that the Abundance glycoform

305

model and the Oxford Class glycoform model for ACE2 are identical (Supplemental Table, Tabs

306

1 and 8). Notably, one site of N-linked glycosylation (N546) is predicted to not be present in 3

307

out of 10,000 humans based on naturally occurring variation in the human population

308

(Supplemental Table, Tab 11). We also modeled ACE2 using the Processed glycoform model

309

(Fig. 6B). In both models, the interaction domain with S is defined (Fig. 6A-B, Supplemental

310

Movie B) .

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the Glycosylated Trimer Spike of SARS-CoV-2 in Complex

313

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to examine the co-complex (generated from a

314

crystal structure of the ACE2-RBD co-complex, PDB code 6M0J, (50)) of glycosylated S with

315

glycosylated ACE2 with the 3 different glycoforms models (Abundance, Oxford Class, and

321

in Figure 7B, are predicted to form interactions with the S protein (Supplemental Table, Tab 15).

322

The N322 glycan interaction with the S trimer is outside of the receptor binding domain, and the

323

interaction is observed across multiple simulations and throughout each simulation (Fig. 7A-B,

324

Supplemental Simulations 1-3). The ACE2 glycan at N090 is close enough to the S trimer

325

surface to repeatedly form interactions, however the glycan arms interact with multiple regions of

326

the surface over the course of the simulations, reflecting the relatively high degree of glycan

327

dynamics (Fig. 7A-B, Supplemental Movie C). Inter-molecule glycan-glycan interactions are

328

also observed repeatedly between the glycan at N546 of ACE2 and those in the S protein at

329

residues N0074 and N0165 (Fig. 7D, Supplemental Table, Tab 16). Finally, a full view of the

330

ACE2-S complex with Oxford class glycoforms on both proteins illustrates the extensive

331

glycosylation at the interface of the complex (Fig. 7C, Supplemental Movie D).

332
333

DISCUSSION

334

We have defined the glycomics-informed, site-specific microheterogeneity of 22 sites of N-linked

335

glycosylation per monomer on a SARS-CoV-2 trimer and the 6 sites of N-linked glycosylation on

336

a soluble version of its human ACE2 receptor using a combination of mass spectrometry

337

approaches coupled with evolutionary and variant sequence analyses to provide a detailed

338

understanding of the glycosylation states of these glycoproteins (Figs. 1-6). Our results suggest

339

essential roles for glycosylation in mediating receptor binding, antigenic shielding, and potentially

340

the evolution/divergence of these glycoproteins.

341

The highly glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, unlike several other viral proteins including

342

HIV-1 (15) but in agreement with another recent report (19), presents significantly more

343

processing of N-glycans towards complex glycosylation, suggesting that steric hindrance to

344

processing enzymes is not a major factor at most sites (Figs. 2-3). However, the N-glycans still

345

provide considerable shielding of the peptide backbone (Fig. 4). Our glycomics-guided

346

glycoproteomic data is in general in strong agreement with the trimer immunogen data recently

347

published by Crispin (19) though we also observed sulfated N-linked glycans, were able to

348

differentiate branching, bisected, and diLacNAc containing structures by glycomics, and observed

349

less occupancy on the 2 most C-terminal N-linked sites using a different approach. Our detection

350

of sulfated N-linked glycans at multiple sites on S is in agreement with a recent manuscript re-

351

analyzing the Crispin data

352

Sulfated N-linked glycans could potentially play key roles in immune regulation and receptor

353

binding as in other viruses (51). This result is especially significant in that sulfated N-glycans

354

were not observed when we performed glycomics on ACE2. At each individual site, the glycans

355

we observed on our immunogen appear to be slightly more processed but the overlap between

356

our analysis and the Crispin’s group results (19) at each site in terms of major features are nearly

357

superimposable. This agreement differs substantially when comparing our and Crispin’s data (19)

358

to that of the Azadi group (23) that analyzed S1 and S2 that had been expressed individually.

359

When expressed as 2 separate polypeptides and not purified for trimers, several unoccupied

360

sites of N-linked glycosylation were observed and processing at several sites was significantly

361

different (23) than we and others (19) observed. Although O-glycosylation has recently been

362

reported for individually-expressed S1 and S2 domains of the Spike glycoprotein (23), in trimeric

363

form the level of O-glycosylation is extremely low, with the highest level of occupancy we observed

364

being 11% at T0323 (Fig. 4E). The low level of O-linked occupancy we observed is in agreement

365

with Crispin’s analysis of a Spike Trimer immunogen (19) but differs significantly from Azadi’s

366

analyses of individually expressed S1 and S2 (23). Thus, the context in which the Spike protein

367

is expressed and purified before analyses significantly alters the glycosylation of the protomer

368

that is reminiscent of previous studies looking at expression of the HIV-1 envelope Spike (15,52).

369

The soluble ACE2 protein examined here contains 6 highly utilized sites of N-linked glycosylation

370

dominated by complex type N-linked glycans (Fig. 5). O-glycans were also present on this

371

glycoprotein but at very low levels of occupancy at all sites (<2%).

372

Our glycomics-informed glycoproteomics allowed us to assign defined sets of glycans to specific

373

glycosylation sites on 3D-structures of S and ACE2 glycoproteins based on experimental

374

evidence (Figs. 4, 6). Similar to almost all glycoproteins, microheterogeneity is evident at most

(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.31.125302v1).

375

glycosylation sites of S and ACE2; each glycosylation site can be modified with one of several

376

glycan structures, generating site-specific glycosylation portfolios.

377

however, explicit structures must be placed at each glycosylation site. In order to capture the

378

impact of microheterogenity on S and ACE2 molecular dynamics we chose to generate

379

glycoforms for modeling that represented reasonable portfolios of glycan types.

380

glycoform models for S (Abundance, Oxford Class, and Processed) and 2 models for ACE2

381

(Abundance, which was equivalent to Oxford Class, and Processed), we generated 3 molecular

382

dynamics simulations of the co-complexes of these 2 glycoproteins (Fig. 7 and Supplemental

383

Simulations 1-3). The observed interactions over time allowed us to evaluate glycan-protein

384

contacts between the 2 proteins as well as examine potential glycan-glycan interactions (Fig. 7).

385

We observed glycan-mediated interactions between the S trimer and glycans at N090, N322 and

386

N546 of ACE2. Thus, variations in glycan occupancy or processing at these sites, could alter the

387

affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 – ACE2 interaction and modulate infectivity. It is well established that

388

glycosylation states vary depending on tissue and cell type as well as in the case of humans, on

389

age (53), underlying disease (54,55) and ethnicity (56). Thus glycosylation portfolios may in part

390

be responsible for tissue tropism and individual susceptibility to infection. The importance of

391

glycosylation for S binding to ACE2 is even more emphatically demonstrated by the direct glycan-

392

glycan interactions observed (Fig. 7) between S glycans (at N0074 and N0165) and an ACE2

393

receptor glycan (at N546), adding an additional layer of complexity for interpreting the impact of

394

glycosylation on individual susceptibility.

395

Several emerging variants of the virus appear to be altering N-linked glycosylation occupancy by

396

disrupting N-linked sequons. Interestingly, the 2 N-linked sequons in SARS-CoV-2 S directly

397

impacted by variants, N0074 and N0149, are in divergent insert regions 1 and 2, respectively, of

398

SARS-CoV-2 S compared to SARS-CoV-1 S (Fig. 4A). The N0074, in particular, is one of the S

399

glycans that interact directly with ACE2 glycan (at N546, Fig. 7), suggesting that glycan-glycan

400

interactions may contribute to the unique infectivity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

401

CoV-1. These sequon variants will also be important to examine in terms of glycan shielding that

402

could influence immunogenicity and efficacy of neutralizing antibodies, as well as interactions with

403

the host cell receptor ACE2. Naturally-occurring amino acid-changing SNPs in the ACE2 gene

404

generate a number of variants including 1 variant, with a frequency of 3 in 10,000 humans, that

405

eliminates a site of N-linked glycosylation at N546 (Fig. 6). Understanding the impact of ACE2

406

variants on glycosylation and more importantly on S binding, especially for N546S which impacts

407

the glycan-glycan interaction between S and ACE2 (Fig. 7), should be prioritized in light of efforts

408

to develop ACE2 as a potential decoy therapeutic. Intelligent manipulation of ACE2 glycosylation

409

may lead to more potent biologics capable of acting as better competitive inhibitors of S binding.

410

The data presented here, and related similar recent findings (19,57,58), provide a framework to

411

facilitate the production of immunogens, vaccines, antibodies, and inhibitors as well as providing

412

additional information regarding mechanisms by which glycan microheterogeneity is achieved.

413

However, considerable efforts still remain in order to fully understand the role of glycans in SARS-

414

CoV-2 infection and pathogenicity. While HEK-expressed S and ACE2 provide a useful window

415

for understanding human glycosylation of these proteins, glycoproteomic characterization

416

following expression in cell lines of more direct relevance to disease and target tissue is sorely

417

needed. While site occupancy may change depending on presentation and cell type (59),

418

processing of N-linked glycans will almost certainly be altered in a cell-type dependent fashion.

419

Thus, analyses of the Spike trimer extracted from pseudoviruses, virion-like particles, and

420

ultimately from infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions harvested from airway cells or patients will provide

421

the most accurate view of how trimer immunogens reflect the true glycosylation pattern of the

422

virus. Detailed analyses of the impact of emerging variants in S and natural and designed-for-

423

biologics variants of ACE2 on glycosylation and binding properties are important next steps for

424

developing therapeutics. Finally, it will be important to monitor the slow evolution of the virus to

425

determine if existing sites of glycosylation are lost or new sites emerge with selective pressure

426

that might alter the efficacy of vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and/or inhibitors.

METHOD DETAILS

564

Expression, Purification, and Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S and Human ACE2

565

Proteins

566

To express a stabilized ectodomain of Spike protein, a synthetic gene encoding residues

567

1−1208 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685) replaced by a

568

“GGSG” sequence, proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, and a foldon trimerization

569

motif followed by a C-terminal 6xHisTag was created and cloned into the mammalian

570

expression vector pCMV-IRES-puro (Codex BioSolutions, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD). The

571

expression construct was transiently transfected in HEK 293F cells using polyethylenimine

572

(Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). Protein was purified from cell supernatants using Ni-NTA

573

resin (Qiagen, Germany), the eluted fractions containing S protein were pooled, concentrated,

574

and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare).

575

Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis was performed as described (62). Briefly,

576

analysis was performed at room temperature with a magnification of 52,000x and a defocus

577

value of 1.5 µm following low-dose procedures, using a Philips Tecnai F20 electron microscope

578

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Gatan US4000 CCD camera and operated at voltage

579

of 200 kV. The DNA fragment encoding human ACE2 (1-615) with a 6xHis tag at C terminus

580

was synthesized by Genscript and cloned to the vector pCMV-IRES-puro. The expression

581

construct was transfected in HEK293F cells using polyethylenimine. The medium was discarded

582

and replaced with FreeStyle 293 medium after 6-8 hours. After incubation in 37 °C with 5.5%

583

CO2 for 5 days, the supernatant was collected and loaded to Ni-NTA resin for purification. The

584

elution was concentrated and further purified by a Superdex 200 column.

585

In-Gel Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and Human ACE2 Proteins

586

A 3.5-μg aliquot of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well as a 2-µg aliquot of human ACE2 were

587

combined with Laemmli sample buffer, analyzed on a 4-12% Invitrogen NuPage Bis-Tris gel

588

using the MES pH 6.5 running buffer, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.

589

Analysis of N-linked and O-linked Glycans Released from SARS-Cov-2 S and Human

590

ACE2 Proteins

591

Aliquots of approximately 25-50 µg of S or ACE2 protein were processed for glycan analysis as

592

previously described (38,39). For N-linked glycan analysis, the proteins were digested with

593

trypsin. Following trypsinization, glycopeptides were enriched by C18 Sep-Pak and subjected to

594

PNGaseF digestion to release N-linked glycans. Following PNGaseF digestion, released

595

glycans were separated from residual glycosylated peptides bearing O-linked glycans by C18

596

Sep-Pak. O-glycosylated peptides were eluted from the Sep-Pak and subjected to reductive b-

597

elimination to release the O-glycans. Another 25-50 µg aliquot of each protein was denatured

598

with SDS and digested with PNGaseF to remove N-linked glycans. The de-N-glycosylated,

599

intact protein was precipitated with cold ethanol and then subjected to reductive b-elimination to

600

release O-glycans. The profiles of O-glycans released from peptides or from intact protein were

601

found to be comparable. N- and O-linked glycans released from glycoproteins were

602

permethylated with methyliodide according to the method of Anumula and Taylor prior to MS

603

analysis (63). Glycan structural analysis was performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap instrument

604

(Orbitrap Discovery, ThermoFisher). Detection and relative quantification of the prevalence of

605

individual glycans was accomplished using the total ion mapping (TIM) and neutral loss scan

606

(NL scan) functionality of the Xcalibur software package version 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

607

as previously described (38,39). Mass accuracy and detector response was tuned with a

608

permethylated oligosaccharide standard in positive ion mode. For fragmentation by collision-

609

induced dissociation (CID in MS2 and MSn), normalized collision energy of 45% was applied.

610

Most permethylated glycans were identified as singly or doubly charged, sodiated species in

611

positive mode. Sulfated N-glycans were detected as singly or doubly charged, deprotonated

612

species in negative ion mode. Peaks for all charge states were deconvoluted by the charge

613

state and summed for quantification. All spectra were manually interpreted and annotated. The

614

explicit identities of individual monosaccharide residues have been assigned based on known

615

human biosynthetic pathways. Graphical representations of monosaccharide residues are

616

consistent with the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG), which has been broadly adopted

617

by the glycomics community (64). The MS-based glycomics data generated in these analyses

618

and the associated annotations are presented in accordance with the MIRAGE standards and

619

the Athens Guidelines (65). Data annotation and assignment of glycan accession identifiers

620

were facilitated by GRITS Toolbox, GlyTouCan, GNOme, and GlyGen (40,66-68).

621

Analysis of Disulfide Bonds for SARS-Cov-2 S Protein by LC-MS

622

Two 10-μg aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were denatured by incubating with 20%

623

acetonitrile at room temperature and alkylated by 13.75 mM of iodoacetamide at room

624

temperature in dark. The two aliquots of proteins were then digested respectively using alpha

625

lytic protease, or a combination of trypsin, Lys-C and Glu-C. Following digestion, the proteins

626

were deglycosylated by PNGaseF treatment. The resulting peptides were separated on an

627

Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 µm x 15 cm) and eluted into the nano-electrospray ion

628

source of an Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 200

629

nL/min. The elution gradient consists of 1-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 370 minutes

630

followed by 10 minutes of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The spray voltage was set to 2.2

632

from m/z 200 to 2000 at 60k resolution, and MS/MS scans following electron transfer

633

dissociation (ETD) were collected in the Orbitrap at 15k resolution. The raw spectra were

634

analyzed by Byonic (v3.8.13, Protein Metrics Inc.) with mass tolerance set as 20 ppm for both

635

precursors and fragments. The search output was filtered at 0.1% false discovery rate and 10

636

ppm mass error. The spectra assigned as cross-linked peptides were manually evaluated for

637

Cys0015 and Cys0136.

Analysis of Site-Specific N-linked Glycopeptides for SARS-Cov-2 S and Human ACE2

639

Proteins by LC-MS

640

Four 3.5-μg aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were reduced by incubating with 10 mM of

641

dithiothreitol at 56 °C and alkylated by 27.5 mM of iodoacetamide at room temperature in dark.

642

The four aliquots of proteins were then digested respectively using alpha lytic protease,

643

chymotrypsin, a combination of trypsin and Glu-C, or a combination of Glu-C and AspN. Three

644

10-μg aliquots of ACE2 protein were reduced by incubating with 5 mM of dithiothreitol at 56 °C

645

and alkylated by 13.75 mM of iodoacetamide at room temperature in dark. The three aliquots of

646

proteins were then digested respectively using alpha lytic protease, chymotrypsin, or a

647

combination of trypsin and Lys-C. The resulting peptides were separated on an Acclaim

was set to 2.2 kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 280 °C. Full MS scans

692

were acquired from m/z 200 to 2000 at 60k resolution, and MS/MS scans following collision-

gradient consists of 1-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 370 minutes followed by 10

711

minutes of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The spray voltage was set to 2.2 kV and the

712

temperature of the heated capillary was set to 280 °C. Full MS scans were acquired from m/z

713

200 to 2000 at 60k resolution, and MS/MS scans following higher-energy collisional dissociation

714

(HCD) with stepped collision energy (15%, 25%, 35%) or electron transfer dissociation (ETD)

715

were collected in the Orbitrap at 15k resolution. The raw spectra were analyzed by Byonic

716

(v3.8.13) with mass tolerance set as 20 ppm for both precursors and fragments. MS/MS filtering

717

was applied to only allow for spectra where the oxonium ions of HexNAc were observed. The

718

search output was filtered at 0.1% false discovery rate and 10 ppm mass error. The spectra

719

assigned as O-linked glycopeptides were manually evaluated. Quantitation was performed by

720

calculating spectral counts for each glycan composition at each site. Any O-linked glycan

721

compositions identified by only one spectra were removed from quantitation. Occupancy of each

722

O-linked glycosylation site was calculated using spectral counts assigned to any glycosylated

723

peptides and their unmodified counterparts from searches without MS/MS filtering.

Sequence Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and Human ACE2 Proteins

725

The genomes of SARS-CoV as well as bat and pangolin coronavirus sequences reported to be

726

closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from NCBI. The S protein sequences from all

727

of those genomes were aligned using EMBOSS needle v6.6.0 (61) via the EMBL-EBI provided

728

web service (69). Manual analysis was performed in the regions containing canonical N-

729

glycosylation sequons (N-X-S/T). For further sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S variants, the

730

genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from NCBI and GISAID and further processed

731

using Biopython 1.76 to extract all sequences annotated as “surface glycoprotein” and to

732

remove any incomplete sequence as well as any sequence containing unassigned amino acids.

733

For sequence analysis of human ACE2 variants, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of

734

ACE2 were extracted from the NCBI dbSNP database and filtered for missense mutation entries

with a reported minor allele frequency. Manual analysis was performed on both SARS-CoV-2 S

736

and human ACE2 variants to further examine the regions containing canonical N-glycosylation

3D Structural Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2

740

S and Human ACE2 Proteins

741

SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) protein structure and ACE2 co-complex – A 3D structure of the prefusion

742

form of the S protein (RefSeq: YP_009724390.1, UniProt: P0DTC2 SPIKE_SARS2), based on a

743

Cryo-EM structure (PDB code 6VSB) (48), was obtained from the SWISS-MODEL server

744

(swissmodel.expasy.org). The model has 95% coverage (residues 27 to 1146) of the S protein.

745

The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the “open” conformation was replaced with the RBD from

746

an ACE2 co-complex (PDB code 6M0J) by grafting residues C336 to V524.

747

Glycoform generation – Glycans (detected by glycomics) were selected for installation on

748

glycosylated S and ACE2 sequons (detected by glycoproteomics) based on three sets of criteria

749

designed to reasonably capture different aspects of glycosylation microheterogeneity. We

750

denote the first of these glycoform models as “Abundance.” The glycans selected for

751

installation to generate the Abundance model were chosen because they were identified as the

752

most abundant glycan structure (detected by glycomics) that matched the most abundant glycan

753

composition (detected by glycoproteomics) at each individual site. We denote the second

754

glycoform model as “Oxford Class.” The glycans selected for installation to generate the Oxford

755

Class model were chosen because they were the most abundant glycan structure, (detected by

756

glycomics) that was contained within the most highly represented Oxford classification group

757

(detected by glycoproteomics) at each individual site (Fig. S7, Supplemental Table, Tabs 1,8).

758

Finally, we denote the third glycoform model as “Processed.” The glycans selected for

759

installation to generate the Processed model were chosen because they were the most highly

760

trimmed, elaborated, or terminally decorated structure (detected by glycomics) that

761

corresponded to a composition (detected by glycoproteomics) which was present at ³ 1/3rd of

762

the abundance of the most highly represented composition at each site (Supplemental Table,

763

Tab 1). 3D structures of the three glycoforms (Abundance, Oxford Class, Processed) were

764

generated for the SARS-CoV2 S protein alone, and in complex with the glycosylated ACE2

765

protein. The glycoprotein builder available at GLYCAM-Web (www.glycam.org) was employed

766

together with an in-house program that adjusts the asparagine side chain torsion angles and

767

glycosidic linkages within known low-energy ranges (70) to relieve any atomic overlaps with the

768

core protein, as described previously (71,72).

769

Energy minimization and Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations – Each glycosylated structure

770

was placed in a periodic box of TIP3P water molecules with a 10 Å buffer between the solute

771

and the box edge. Energy minimization of all atoms was performed for 20,000 steps (10,000

772

steepest decent, followed by 10,000 conjugant gradient) under constant pressure (1 atm) and

773

temperature (300 K) conditions. All MD simulations were performed under nPT conditions with

774

the CUDA implementation of the PMEMD (73,74) simulation code, as present in the Amber14

775

software suite (University of California, San Diego). The GLYCAM06j force field (75) and

776

Amber14SB force field (76) were employed for the carbohydrate and protein moieties,

777

respectively. A Berendsen barostat with a time constant of 1 ps was employed for pressure

778

regulation, while a Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps-1 was employed for

779

temperature regulation. A nonbonded interaction cut-off of 8 Å was employed. Long-range

780

electrostatics were treated with the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method (77). Covalent bonds

781

involving hydrogen were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm, allowing an integration time

782

step of 2 fs to be employed. The energy minimized coordinates were equilibrated at 300K over

783

400 ps with restraints on the solute heavy atoms. Each system was then equilibrated with

784

restraints on the Ca atoms of the protein for 1ns, prior to initiating 4 independent 250 ns

785

production MD simulations with random starting seeds for a total time of 1 µs per system, with

786

no restraints applied.

Antigenic surface analysis. A series of 3D structure snapshots of the simulation were taken at 1

788

ns intervals and analysed in terms of their ability to interact with a spherical probe based on the

789

average size of hypervariable loops present in an antibody complementarity determining region

790

(CDR), as described recently (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030445v2).

The percentage of simulation time each residue was exposed to the AbASA probe was

792
793
794

calculated and plotted onto both the 3D structure and primary sequence.

795

293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike

796

(pcDNAintron-SARS-2-S∆19). To increase cell surface expression, the last 19 amino acids

797

containing the Golgi retention signal were removed. Two S∆19 constructs were compared, one

798

started with Met1 and the other with Met2. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were

799

transduced with ppVSV∆G-VSV-G (particles that were pseudotyped with VSV-G in trans). One

800

hour following transduction cells were extensively washed and media was replaced.

801

Supernatant containing particles were collected 12-24 hour following transduction and cleared

802

through centrifugation. Cleared supernatant was frozen at -80°C for future use. Target cells

803

VeroE6 were seeded in 24-well plates (5x105 cells/mL) at a density of 80% coverage. The

804

following day, ppVSV-SARS-2-S/GFP particles were transduced into target cells for 60 minutes,

805

particles pseudotyped with VSV-G, Lassa virus GP, or no glycoprotein were included as

806

controls. 24 hours following transduction, transduced cells were released from the plate with

807

trypsin, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and GFP-positive virus-transduced cells were quantified

808

using flow cytometry (Bectin Dickson BD-LSRII). To quantify the ability of various SARS-CoV-2

809

S mutants to mediate fusion, effector cells (HEK293T) were transiently transfected with the

810

indicated pcDNAintron-SARS-2-S expression vector or measles virus H and F (78). Effector
