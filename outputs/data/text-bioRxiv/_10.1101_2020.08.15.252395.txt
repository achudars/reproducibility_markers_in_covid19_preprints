Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with
significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility
of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for
interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to
develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the
ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection
in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and
(iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate
in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of
the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral
replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the
sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate
that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, fiveweek old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal
challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2
and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.

Introduction
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has resulted
in a global pandemic with over 20 million cases and 740,000 deaths as of August 13,
2020 [1,2]. SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory disease in humans with a broad clinical
presentation, ranging from asymptomatic or mild illness to severe fatal disease with
multi-organ failure [3-6]. SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly transmissible via contact with
infected respiratory droplets and can also be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers [6-8].
To curb viral spread, countries have instituted varying levels of social distancing
policies, which have significant negative economic and social impacts [9]. Mitigating
the effects of this unprecedented pandemic will necessitate the development of effective
vaccines and therapeutics, which will require well-characterized and standardized preclinical animal models.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus that includes the
pathogenic human viruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [2,10-12]. While details of
the origin of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown, evidence indicates it emerged from a zoonotic
spillover event, with bats and perhaps pangolins as probable origin species [2,13-15].
The potential for a reverse zoonotic event, i.e. human-to-animal transmission, is
possible and of significant concern to animal and public health [16-18]. Instances of
natural human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with
COVID-19 patients in domestic settings (dogs and cats), zoos (lions and tigers), and
farms (mink) [18-20]. Therefore, investigations into the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in
various animal species with human contact are essential to assess and control the risk of
a spillover event and to establish the role these animals may play in the ecology of the
virus.
Several studies have determined the susceptibility of different animal species to
SARS-CoV-2 via experimental infection [20,21]. Cats, hamsters, and ferrets are highly
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrate varying clinical and pathological
disease manifestations, readily transmit the virus to naïve animals, and mount a virusspecific immune response [22-28]. Dogs are mildly susceptible to experimental SARSCoV-2 infection, with limited viral replication but with clear evidence of
seroconversion in some animals [22]. Poultry species seem to be resistant to SARSCoV-2 infection [22,26]. These findings establish the respective utility of different
animal species as pre-clinical models to study SARS-CoV-2.
Several lines of evidence suggest that pigs could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection. Pigs are susceptible to both experimental and natural infection with the
related Betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and demonstrate seroconversion [29,30].
Structure-based analyses predict that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein receptor
binding domain (RBD) binds the pig angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) entry
receptor with similar efficiency compared to human ACE2 [31]. Single-cell screening
also indicated that pigs co-express ACE2 and the TMPRSS2 activating factor in a
variety of different cell lines, and SARS-CoV-2 replicates in various pig cell lines
[2,26,32,33]. Despite these preliminary data indicating that pigs could be susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, two recent studies revealed that intranasal inoculation of three
and twelve pigs, respectively, with 105 pfu or TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 did not lead to
any detectable viral replication or seroconversion [22,26]. However, the single route of
intranasal inoculation used in these studies suggests that additional investigations are

necessary before definitive conclusions can be made regarding susceptibility of pigs to
SARS-CoV-2.
In the present study, we determined the susceptibility of swine cell lines and
domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two different porcine cell lines were found to
be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection showing cytopathic effects (CPE). Domestic
pigs were challenged via simultaneous oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation with a
106 TCID50 dose of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate in pigs and none of
them seroconverted. Furthermore, the virus was not transmitted from SARS-CoV-2
inoculated animals to sentinels. The present findings, combined with the other studies
[22,26], confirm that pigs seem resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite clear
susceptibility of porcine cell lines. Pigs are therefore unlikely to play an important role
in the COVID-19 pandemic as a virus reservoir or as a pre-clinical animal model to
study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or develop novel countermeasures.
Materials and Methods
Virus and cells
SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate (GenBank accession # MN985325) [34] was
obtained from BEI resources (catalog # NR-52281, American Type Culture Collection
[ATCC®]. Manassas, VA, USA). The virus was passaged three times in VeroE6 cells
(ATCC® CRL-1586™), before being passaged two times in swine testicle (ST; ATCC
CRL-1746™) and four times in porcine kidney (PK-15; ATCC® CCL-33™) cell lines
to investigate suitability of these swine cell lines for propagation of SARS-CoV-2. The
first passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from ST cells was used to prepare the challenge
material. Back-titer of the virus inoculum stock was 3.15x105 TCID50/mL All
experiments involving the SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed under Biosafety Level
3+ (BSL-3+) conditions at the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI) at Kansas State
University (KSU), Manhattan, KS, USA.
Outline of animal experiments
Animal infection experiments using swine were performed under BSL-3Ag
conditions at the BRI at KSU. Animal research was conducted in compliance with the
Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animal care
and experimentation under protocol #4390, approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at Kansas State University on April 8, 2020.

Eighteen pigs (mix of males and females, five weeks of age) were used in the
study. Pigs were acquired from a source guaranteed free of swine influenza virus (SIV),
porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) infection. The study outline is illustrated in Figure 1. Upon arrival, pigs were
acclimated for 3 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. Nine pigs were designated as
uninfected negative controls and housed in separate BSL-2 facilities. Three of these
uninfected negative control pigs were humanely euthanized at 3 days post challenge
(DPC) to provide negative control clinical and tissue samples. The nine principal
infected pigs were housed in the same room in two separate groups (4 or 5 pigs each;
Figure 1) and were infected with 1.3 x106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 orally (1 mL),
intranasally (1 ml; 0.5 ml each nostril) and intratracheally (2 mL), after being
anesthetized with a mixture of telazol/xylazine. Three sentinel contact pigs were added
to each group on 1 DPC (Figure 1). Rectal temperature and signs of clinical disease for
each pig were determined daily throughout the study; clinical signs include overall
activity/attitude (signs of depression, decreased alertness or unresponsiveness), appetite
(based on interest in treats), respiratory signs (sneezing, coughing, labored breathing,
nasal discharge), and digestive signs (diarrhea or vomiting). Blood samples and nasal,
oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected in virus transport medium (VTM;
DMEM plus antibiotic/antimycotic) at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 DPC. As summarized
in Table 1 and Figure 1, pigs were humanely euthanized for scheduled post mortem
examinations on 4 DPC (3 principal infected pigs), 8 DPC (3 principal infected pigs),
and 21 DPC (remaining 3 principal infected and 6 sentinel pigs) to collect respiratory
tissue samples, with blood and swab samples collected on pigs prior to euthanasia.
Gross pathological examinations on major organs were performed and respiratory tissue
samples were collected and either stored in 10% neutral-buffered formalin or stored as
fresh samples at -80˚C. Blood and swab samples were all filtered using a 0.2µm filter
prior to storage at -80˚C.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
RNA was isolated from blood, swabs, and tissue samples, using a magnetic
bead-based protocol in a BSL-3+ laboratory at the BRI at KSU. Lung tissue
homogenates (200 mg per 1mL DMEM; 20% w/v) were prepared by thawing tissue,
mincing it into 1mm sections, followed by lysis in a 2 mL sure-lock tube containing 5
mm stainless steel homogenization beads using the TissueLyser LT (Qiagen,

Germantown, MD, USA) for 30 seconds at 30 hz followed by 1 min of 30 hz while
keeping the sample cold. Following clarification via a 3-minute centrifugation (3,000xg;
room temperature), supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of RLT lysis buffer.
Blood and clinical swabs were directly mixed with an equal volume of RLT lysis buffer.
200 µL of each sample lysate was used to extract RNA using a magnetic bead-based
nucleic acid extraction kit (GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA) on an automated
TacoMiniTM nucleic acid extraction system (GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA)
according to manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications: beads were
added to the sample well, followed by the RLT sample lysate, then 200 µL molecular
grade isopropanol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added. The last
wash buffer was replaced by molecular grade 200 proof ethanol (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Extraction positive controls (IDT, IA, USA; 2019nCoV_N_Positive Control, diluted 1:100 in RLT buffer) and negative controls were
employed. Extracted RNA was eluted in 100µL buffer.
Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect
viral RNA using the CDC standard N2-based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay [35] that
was validated for use with the qScript XLT 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix (Quantabio,
Beverly, MA, USA) on a CFX96 real-time thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
using a 20 minute RT step and 45 cycle qPCR in a 20 µL reaction volume. RT-qPCR on
each sample was performed in duplicate wells with a quantitated PCR positive control
(IDT 2019-nCoV N Positive Control, diluted 1:100) and four non-template negative
controls on every plate. A positive Ct cut-off of 40 cycles was used. A plasmid template
including the SARS-CoV-2 N gene was used as a positive PCR amplification control. A
10-point standard curve using quantitated stock viral RNA (USA-WA1/2020 isolate)
was used to quantify RNA copy number.
Gross pathology and histopathology
During post mortem examinations, the upper and lower respiratory tract, central
nervous system, lymphatic and cardiovascular systems, gastrointestinal and urogenital
systems, and integument were evaluated. Lungs were removed in toto and the
percentage of the lung surface that was affected by macroscopic lesions was estimated
by single veterinarian experienced in evaluating gross porcine lung pathology as
previously described [36,37]. Lungs were evaluated for gross pathology such as edema,
congestion, discoloration, atelectasis, and consolidation. Tissue samples of interest were

collected and either fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histopathological
examination or frozen at -80˚C for RT-qPCR testing. Tissues were fixed in formalin for
7 days, then transferred to 70% ethanol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
prior to trimming and paraffin embedding following standard automated protocols used
in the histology section of the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.
Following embedding, tissue sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
and evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist who was blinded to the
treatment groups.
Serological testing
To detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera, indirect ELISAs were performed
using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) expressed in HEK
cells with a C-terminal Strep-Tag and the Nucleocapsid (N) protein expressed in E.coli
with a C-terminal His-tag. Briefly, the recombinant proteins were produced in their
respective expression systems according to standard procedures and purified using
either Ni-NTA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or Strep-Tactin (IBA
Lifesciences, Goettingen, Germany) columns according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For testing, 96-well plates were coated with 100 ng of the recombinant protein in 100µL
of sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4˚C. The wells were
then washed and blocked with casein blocking buffer. Sera dilutions were diluted 1:200
in 100µL of casein blocking buffer, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, then
washed with washing solution. 100 µL anti-pig-IgG or IgM secondary antibodies,
conjugated with peroxidase, were diluted 1:2,500 in blocking buffer and then incubated
at room temperature for 1 hour, protected from light. TMB colorimetric substrate was
added and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, then the reaction was stopped
with a solution of 0.2 sulfuric acid. The optical density (OD) value was measured at 450
nm within 5 minutes of adding the stop solution to quantify the amount of antigenbinding antibody present in the sample. Sera from mock-infected pigs were used as
negative controls. Sera collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected cats, from a different
study [38], were used as a positive control. Serum from pigs infected with African
Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) and the baculovirus-expressed ASFV-p54 antigen were
used as a positive control for anti-pig-IgG or IgM secondary antibodies. The cutoff for a
sample being called positive was defined by the average OD 0 DPC serum +3x standard
deviation.

The presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in sera was determined via
microneutralization assay. Serum samples were diluted 1:10 and heat-inactivated at
56˚C for 30 minutes while shaking. Subsequently, 100 µL per well of serum samples in
duplicate were subjected to 2-fold serial dilutions starting at 1:20 through 1:2560 in
100µL culture media. 100 µL of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was then added to 100
µL of the sera dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37˚C, followed by culture of the
mixture on VeroE6 cells in 96-well plates. Results of the virus neutralization were
determined by the appearance of CPE, which was observed under a microscope at 96
hours post inoculation. The neutralizing antibody titer is determined as the reciprocal of
the average serum dilution at which no CPE breakthrough in any of the testing wells is
observed. Neutralizing sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected cats from a separate study [38]
was used as a positive control.
Next Generation Sequencing
To determine the consensus sequence of the USA-WA/1/2020 virus and to
analyze if there were any nucleic acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 virus after
passage in porcine cell lines, RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant as
described above. The RNA was then subjected to RT-PCR amplification using a tiledprimer approach to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome as described previously
[39]. Briefly, the PCR amplicons were pooled and subjected to library preparation for
Next Generation Sequencing using the Nextera XT library prep kit (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA). The library was normalized and sequenced using a MiSeq nano v2
2x250 sequencing kit. The sequence was then analyzed by mapping reads to the parent
sequence (Genbank accession # MN985325) [34] to generate a consensus sequence.
Results
Propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in swine cells
The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate, which was isolated from a human
patient in Washington State, USA, was used as the parent stock for the study [34]. The
virus stock was passaged 3 times at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 0.001 and
0.01 in VeroE6 cells and NGS sequenced before being inoculated onto porcine cells.
The consensus sequence of the VeroE6-passaged virus was 100% identical to the
GenBank reference sequence (GenBank accession # MN985325). To determine the
susceptibility of porcine cell lines to SARS-CoV-2 infection, swine testicle (ST) and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.252395; this version posted August 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

porcine kidney (PK-15) cell lines were inoculated with approximately 0.05 MOI of
passage 3 of the VeroE6-passaged SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA/1/2020 isolate. No obvious
cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in either cell line during the first passage,
however clear CPE was observed in passage two in ST cells and passage four in PK-15
cells (Figure 2). Cell culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 passage one and two on
ST cells, and passage three on PK-15 cells was collected, and RNA extracted for
sequencing. Next generation sequencing was performed to generate a consensus
genomic sequence for the ST- and PK-15-passaged SARS-CoV-2 virus. No nucleotide
mutations or amino acid substitutions were observed upon passage in the two porcine
cell lines. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to readily infect porcine
kidney and testicle cells without the requirement of obvious genetic adaptation. SARSCoV-2 from passage 1 in ST cells was used as challenge material for the pig
inoculation.
Oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation of pigs with SARS-CoV-2
To determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in domestic pigs, nine sixweek-old SARS-CoV-2 seronegative piglets were inoculated with a total of 1 x 106
TCID50 of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate, which was passaged once in swine ST cells
(Figure 1). The challenge material (total 4 mL) was administered orally (1 mL),
intranasally (1 mL; 0.5 mL each nostril) and intratracheally (2 mL) after sedation of the
animals. At 1-day post challenge (DPC), six uninoculated sentinel contact pigs were comingled with the principal inoculated animals (3 animals per pen). Daily rectal
temperatures were recorded for each pig and clinical signs were monitored daily,
including observations for signs of lethargy, hyporexia, respiratory distress (coughing,
labored breathing, nasal discharge), and digestive issues (diarrhea or vomiting). No
significant temperature elevation or change in rectal temperature was observed in the
principal inoculated nor sentinel contact pigs throughout the study (Figure 3).
Moreover, no obvious clinical signs were observed for any of the principal inoculated
nor sentinel pigs throughout the 21-day observation period.
To detect viral replication in the principal and sentinel pigs, clinical samples
were subjected to RT-qPCR to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N gene (Table 2) [35]. Blood
and oropharyngeal, nasal, and rectal swabs were collected at various time points
throughout the study and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were collected at
post-mortem examinations on 4, 8 and 21 DPC. RT-qPCR failed to detect any viral

RNA in any swab or blood sample for the duration of the study (Table 2). The only the
exception was a low suspect positive result in a nasal swab at 1 DPC in a principal
inoculated pig #161, for which one of two qPCR replicates yielded a low fluorescent
amplification curve with a Ct of 37 (Table 2). Moreover, viral RNA was not detected in
any lung sample collected at post-mortem examination on 4, 8 and 21 DPC (Table 2). In
addition, gross and histopathological analysis of trachea and lung from the principal
challenged pigs did not reveal the presence of any obvious pathological lesions (Table
3, Figure 4). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 failed to replicate in the
respiratory and digestive tract as well as the blood in orally/intranasally/intratracheally
inoculated pigs throughout an observation period of 21 days. This is confirmed by the
fact that the principal infected pigs failed to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to co-mingled
sentinel animals.
Absence of immune response in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs
To determine whether the orally/intranasally/intratracheally inoculated pigs
developed an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, sera collected from
infected pigs at various time points post infection was subjected to indirect ELISAs to
detect IgG and IgM antibodies reactive against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.
Cumulatively, the results from these assays indicated that the infected pigs did not
develop an IgG or IgM immune response against either of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens at
any point throughout the study (Figure 5). The sera from one sentinel pig (#894) did
show transient IgM reactivity on 3 and 5 DPC against N and RBD and an isolated IgG
reactivity against RBD on 3 DPC. In addition, neutralizing antibody experiments
performed with sera collected from principal inoculated and sentinel contact pigs
necropsied at 14 and 21 DPC, revealed that none of the pigs developed neutralizing
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is
unable to replicate and generate an immune response in pigs upon
oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation. In addition, transmission to sentinel contact
animals was not possible.
Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic agent, and a detailed understanding of the
susceptibility of various animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is central to controlling its

spread [16,17]. In addition, the development of animal models that emulate COVID-19
in humans is essential for pre-clinical testing of novel vaccines and therapeutics [20]. In
this study, we inoculated nine pigs with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 that was passaged
once in porcine cells. Simultaneous oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation did not
result in any detectable viral RNA in the blood, the oral/nasal/rectal cavities, or the
lungs. Also, none of the co-mingled, sentinel contact pigs shed viral RNA. Moreover, a
virus-specific immune response characteristic of infection was not observed within the
21-day study period in the principal infected or sentinel pigs. The transient nature of
the IgM and IgG response observed in pig #848 could indicate cross-reactivity of
antibodies directed against a porcine coronavirus such as porcine epidemic diarrhea
virus [40]. Such antibodies could be maternally derived and therefore transient as the
lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific reactivity by the end of the study might suggest. In
contrast to previous SARS-CoV-2 swine studies [22,26], the present study used a more
stringent inoculation procedure (intratracheal and oral, in addition to intranasal) and 1
log higher titer of virus inoculum (106 vs 105). In addition, the inoculum in the present
study was passaged once in porcine ST cells. These results, combined with previous
intranasal pig inoculation studies [22,26], indicate that pigs seem to be resistant to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, are unlikely to be a SARS-CoV-2 carrier animal species, and
are also not suitable as an animal model for research.
The results of the present and previous SARS-CoV-2 inoculation studies in pigs
are intriguing in light of the findings that the porcine ACE2 receptor seems highly
compatible with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, suggesting that pigs could be susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infection [2,31]. Pigs are susceptible to both experimental and natural
infection with SARS-CoV-1 [29,30]. However, the experimental SARS-CoV-1
infection was via simultaneous intranasal/oral/intraocular/intravenous inoculation [29],
thus the actual route(s) of SARS-CoV infection cannot be determined. Recently, several
porcine cell lines have been shown to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [26,33];
in addition, single-cell screening studies showed that porcine ACE2/TMPRSS2
expression are compatible with infection [32]. In contrast to previous reports that some
porcine cell lines are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but show no CPE [26,33],
we found that both ST and PK-15 cell lines are susceptible to infection and observed
CPE after two or four passages, respectively. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 replication
and transmission in the present and two previous pigs studies [22,26] seems to lessen
the need to monitor pig populations for SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing pandemic.

However, the evidence described above suggests pig susceptibility should not be
disregarded, because all pig studies to date have used rather young pigs and
commercially available pig breeds/genetics. We also have to be aware that unforeseen
genetic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may result in a better compatibility of the
virus for pigs in the future.
Pigs are considered to be an excellent model for studying human infectious
diseases based on their relatedness to humans in terms of anatomy and immune
responses and they have been found to be much more predictive for the efficacy of
therapeutics when compared to rodent models [41]. However, the results presented here
indicate that pigs are not a suitable preclinical model for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis
studies and the development and efficacy testing of therapeutics and/or vaccines. A
recently available article indicates that while pigs are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection, neutralizing antibody responses were detected in pigs infected via
intramuscular or intravenous inoculation routes [42]; this indicates that pigs could be
used for immunogenicity studies related to SARS-CoV-2. However, the use of pigs to
monitor SARS-CoV-2 immune responses must be careful to screen for cross-reactive
maternal antibodies derived from other coronaviruses [43]. Alternate pre-clinical animal
models, namely non-human primates, Syrian hamsters, transgenic or transduced mice
expressing human ACE2, ferrets, or even cats need to be considered to gain additional
insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and virulence. Comprehensive characterization
of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in preclinical animal models and the establishment of
standardized infection and testing protocols will be crucial for the development of
much-need countermeasures to combat COVID-19.

Figures

Figure 1. Study Design. Eighteen pigs were placed into three groups. Group 1 (principal
infected animals) consisted of nine pigs (four and five in each pen) and was inoculated
via intranasal (IN), oral (PO), and intratracheal (IT) routes simultaneously with a total
dose of 1 x 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 in 4mL DMEM. The pigs in Group 2 (n=6;
sentinel contact animals) and Group 3 (n=3; mock control animals) were housed in a
separate room. At 1-day post challenge (DPC), the six pigs in Group 2 were co-mingled
with the principal infected animals in Group 1 (three pigs per pen) and served as
sentinel contact controls. The remaining three pigs in Group 3 remained in separate
housing and served as mock-infected negative controls and were euthanized and
necropsied on 3 DPC. Principal infected animals were euthanized and necropsied at 4
(n=3), 8 (n=3), and 21 (n=3) to determine the course of infection. All six sentinel pigs
were also euthanized on 21 DPC.

Figure 2. Cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 in Swine Testicle (ST) and Porcine
Kidney (PK-15) cells. SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate was passaged in ST and
PK-15 porcine cells. Passage two in ST cells (B) and passage four in PK-15 cells (C)
resulted in clear CPE, similar to that observed in permissive VeroE6 cells (A). No CPE
is observed in the uninfected VeroE6 or porcine cells lines (D, E, F).

pigs. Daily average rectal temperatures of pigs inoculated orally, intranasally, and
intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2 (red) and co-mingled sentinel pigs (green) showed no
significant change over the course of the experiment. The baseline temperature (blue;
39.6˚C to 40.4˚C) was determined from all pigs before infection.

Figure 5. Immunological response in pigs infected orally/intranasally/intratracheally
with SARS-CoV-2 and sentinel contact pigs. Indirect ELISAs were performed against
the SARS-CoV-2 antigens N (nucleocapsid protein [A, B]) and RBD (Spike protein
receptor binding domain [C, D]) to detect an antigen-specific IgG (A, C) or IgM (B, D)
antibodies. Sera reactivity was determined for three principal infected pigs (#893, #193,
#219) and three sentinel pigs (#848, #172, #894). The cutoff for a positive sample was
determined by +3 standard deviations of 0 DPC samples (dotted line). Feline SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies were used as a positive control from a separate study (left
bar, [38]). Porcine positive control sera for IgG/IgM-specific antibodies were ASFVinfected pig sera detecting the ASFV-p54 antigen (right bar). Uninfected pigs were used
as a negative control. O.D. – optical density.
