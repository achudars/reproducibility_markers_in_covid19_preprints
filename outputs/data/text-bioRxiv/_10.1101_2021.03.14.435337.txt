Abstract

16

Germicidal potential of specific wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum is an

17

area of growing interest. While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown

18

satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated

19

polymer degradation limit its use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths

20

with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in

21

the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405

22

nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the

23

organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its

24

DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based

25

technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be not effective given the

26

lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of

Introduction

49

The severe-acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative

50

agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, is a member of the beta-coronavirus family and it

51

emerged at the end of 2019 in the Hubei province in Wuhan China1. By late February

52

2021, more than 112 million cases had been reported while accounting for

53

approximately 2.5 million deaths, underscoring the rapid dissemination of the virus on a

54

global scale2. As a complement to standard precautions such as handwashing,

55

masking, surface disinfection, and social distancing, other enhancements to enclosed

56

spaces such as improved ventilation and whole-room disinfection are being considered

57

by segments beyond acute healthcare such as retail, dining, and transportation3.

58

Initial guidance from health authorities such as the CDC and WHO on environmental

59

transmission focused on contaminated surfaces as fomites4. Data pertaining to the

60

survival of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses to date has indicated that

61

virions are able to persist on fomites composed of plastic5, wood6, paper5, metal7 and

62

glass8 potentially up to nine days. Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2

63

may also remain viable approximately at least three days in such surfaces and another

64

two studies showed that at room temperature (20-25°C), a 14-day time-period was

65

required to see a 4.5-5 Log10 of the virus9, 10.

66

Since the start of the pandemic, transmission of the virus by respiratory droplets and

67

aerosols has become an accepted method of transmission although the relative impact

68

of each mode of transmission is the subject of much debate. Nevertheless, enclosed

69

spaces with groups of people exercising or singing have been associated with

70

increased transmission.

71

environment has been estimated between 1-2 hours6, 11, 12.

72

Taking this information into consideration, several methods have been evaluated to

73

effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Chemical methods, which focus on surface

74

disinfection, utilize 70% alcohol and bleach and their benefits are well established.

75

These methods are also episodic (or non-continuous) meaning that in-between

76

applications, the environment is not being treated13.

77

In addition to chemicals, one of the most utilized methods for whole-room disinfection is

78

germicidal ultra-violet C (UVC; ~254 nm)14. This technology is well established15 and

79

has been shown to inactivate a range of pathogens including bacteria16, fungi17 and

80

viruses18. The mechanism of action of UVC is photodimerization of genetic material

81

such as RNA (relevant for SARS-CoV2 and IAV) and DNA (relevant for DNA viruses

82

and bacterial pathogens, among others)19.

83

associated with deleterious effects in exposed humans such as photokeratoconunctivitis

84

in eyes and photodermatitis in skin20. For these reasons, UVC irradiation requires safety

85

precautions and cannot be used to decontaminate fomites and high contact areas in the

86

presence of humans21.

87

Germicidal properties of violet-blue visible light (380-500 nm), especially within the

88

range of 405 to 450 nm wavelengths have been appreciated as an alternative to UVC

89

irradiation in whole-room disinfection scenarios where it has shown reduction of

90

bacteria22, 23 in occupied rooms and reductions in surgical site infections24. Although 405

91

nm or closely related wavelengths have been shown to be less germicidal than UVC, its

92

inactivation potential has been assessed in pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria spp

93

and Clostridium spp24,

94

Candida spp26 . It is thought that the underlying mechanism of blue-light mediated

95

inactivation is associated with absorption of light via photosensitizers such as

96

porphyrins which results in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS)

97

emergence of ROS is associated with direct damage to biomolecules such as proteins,

98

lipids and nucleic acids which are essential constituents of bacteria, fungi and viruses.

Further studies have shown that ROS can also lead to the loss of cell membrane

110

use of 405 nm irradiation as a tool to confer continuous decontamination of respiratory

405 nm Exposure System

116

The visible light disinfection product used in this study was Indigo-Clean from Kenall

117

Manufacturing. The product form factor selected was a 6” downlight (M4DLIC6) to allow

118

for use within a BSL-3 rated containment hood. Within the hood, the distance between

119

the face of the fixture and the sample was 10”- much less than the normal 1.5m used in

120

normal, whole-room disinfection applications. The output of the fixture was modified

121

electronically during its manufacture to match this difference and ensure that the

122

measurements would represent the performance of the device in actual use. For the

123

range of output used in this study, multiple discrete levels were created using pulse

124

width modulation within the LED driver itself. These levels were made to be individually

125

selectable using a simple knob on the attached control module.

126

As expected, the amount of visible light within the 400nm-420nm bandwidth is a

127

measurement of the “dose” delivered to the target organism, measured in mWcm-2, is

128

used to quantify this relationship similar to that used in UV disinfection applications.

129

To fully examine this effect, a range of irradiance values were used representing actual

130

product deployment conditions in occupied rooms. The lowest value (0.035 mWcm-2)

131

represents a single-mode, lower wattage used in general lighting applications while the

132

highest value (0.6 mWcm-2) represents a dual-mode, higher wattage used in critical care

133

applications such as an operating room.

134

The device was placed in a rig to ensure a consistent distance (10”) between the fixture

135

and the samples. The output of the fixture in the test rig was measured using a Stellar-

136

RAD Radiometer from StellarNet configured to make wavelength and irradiance

measurements from 350nm-1100nm with < 1nm spectral bandwidth using a NIST

138

traceable calibration. To ensure that the regular white light portion of the illumination

139

(which is non-disinfecting) was not measured, the measurement was electronically

limited to a 1nm bandwidth over the 400nm-420nm range. The normalized spectral

The SARS-CoV-2 virus was exclusively handled at the Icahn school of Medicine BSL-3

171

and studies involving IAV and EMCV were handled in BSL-2 conditions. Indicated PFU

172

amounts were mixed with sterile 1X PBS and were irradiated in 96 well format cell

173

culture plates in triplicates. In these studies, A starting dose of 5x105 PFU for SARS-

174

CoV-2 and starting doses of 1x105 PFU for IAV and EMCV were used. The final

175

volumes for inactivation were 250 μl per replicate. The untreated samples were

176

prepared the same way and were left inside the biosafety cabinet isolated from the

177

inactivation device at room temperature. The plates were sealed with qPCR plate

178

transparent seal and an approximate 10% reduction of the intensity was observed due

179

to the sealing film. The distance from the lamp and the samples was measured to be

204

The lowest irradiation dose of 0.035 mWcm-2 was applied for SARS-CoV-2 and when

205

compared to the initial input (T0) of ~5x105 PFU, a reduction of 55.08% was seen as

206

early as 4 hours and after 24 hours of irradiation, an inactivation of 90.17%

207

(approximately 10 times reduction in infectivity) was observed for SARS-CoV-2 via

208

plaque assays (Figure 2A). A slightly higher dose of 0.076mWcm-2 resulted in a

209

reduction of 98.22% (56 times) after 24 hours when compared to the original input at T0

210

(Figure 2B). Subsequent increase of the irradiation dose to 0.150 mWcm-2 resulted in a

211

reduction of 63.64% after 4 hours which then reached 96.21% after 12 hours. Irradiation

212

for 24 hours at 0.150 mWcm-2 suggested a total reduction of 99.61% (256 times) for

213

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2C). As a final experiment, a high irradiation dose of 0.6 mWcm-2

214

was used to assess the inactivation potential within a much shorter time frame.

Influenza A virus is susceptible to 405 nm inactivation in the absence of

247

In order to better understand the effect of the lipid-envelope in viral inactivation by 405

248

nm irradiation, we used a non-lipid enveloped RNA virus derived from the

249

Picornaviridae family. EMCV virus was irradiated at a high dose of 0.6 mWcm-2 similar

250

to SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.

259

In this case however, a total reduction of 9.1% (approximately 2 times) in comparison to

260

the initial input (T0) after 8 hours of irradiation was observed (Fig 4A and 4 B) indicating

261

a lower rate of inactivation in contrast to the lipid-enveloped RNA viruses tested in this

study. The plaque reduction at 8 hours did not indicate the same dramatic reduction as

263

observed with the latter studies.

269

disinfection systems can be viewed as a supplement to best practices for interrupting

270

transmission of the virus.

271

Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to explore the impact of 405 nm

272

enriched visible light technology on inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-

273

CoV-2 and influenza A virus.

274

Without the use of exogenous photosensitizers, we were able to show that irradiation

275

with low intensity (0.035 mWcm-2) visible light yielded a total of 55.08% inactivation after

276

four hours and a total of 90.17% inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 after 24 hours. A slightly

277

higher dose (0.076 mWcm-2) resulted in 98.22% inactivation after 24 hours while an

278

irradiation dose of 0.150 mWcm-2 showed a reduction of 63.64% and 99.61% after four

279

hours and 24 hours of irradiation, respectively. Finally, increasing the dose to 0.6

280

mwcm-2 yielded 99.74% after eight hours, indicating a both time and dose dependent

281

inactivation of infectious viruses. We selected conventional plaque assays as the read

282

out to specifically estimate infectious virus titers upon disinfection. Methods based in the

283

quantification of viral RNA via PCR based techniques might be misleading as they

284

detect viral RNA from both infectious and noninfectious virions.

285

SARS-CoV-2 is a lipid-enveloped virus composed of a ssRNA genome and our data

286

indicates its susceptibility to visible light mediated inactivation. To further confirm these

287

observations, we used influenza A virus. which is another human respiratory virus with a

288

lipid envelop and an RNA genome. Upon irradiating for 1 hour at 0.6 mWcm-2, we

289

observed a total reduction of 31.11% for the influenza A virus compared to the reduction

290

of 71.52% for SARS-CoV-2 under the same conditions. While both viruses have lipid

291

envelopes, there is clearly a difference here that will require further study. One possible

292

explanation is the difference in the virion size creating a physically smaller cross-section

293

for absorption. (IAV ~120 nm and SARS-CoV-2 ~200 nm)36,

294

viruses were largely inactivated after eight hours- 98.49% for IAV and 99.74% for

295

SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, it was observed that both RNA viruses were able to remain

296

stable at room temperature for at least 24 hours, indicating minimal decay which is

297

consistent with previous studies35,

298

EMCV. Previous results for visible light against non-enveloped viruses demonstrated

299

the need for external photosensitizers such as artificial saliva, blood, feces, etc30,

300

Without a porphyrin containing medium, we expected little to no inactivation when this

301

virus was irradiated with visible light. For these measurements, we used the highest

302

available irradiance of 0.6 mWcm-2. As anticipated, we observed only a 9.1%

303

inactivation after eight hours, however, this appears to be with the statistical precision of

304

the measurement based on the results obtained from shorter irradiations (1, 2, and 4

305

hours). For comparison, a study involving the M13-bacteriophage virus (a non-

306

enveloped virus) showed a 3-Log reduction using an irradiance of 50mWcm-2 (almost

307

100 times greater than the highest irradiance used in this study) for 10 hours at 425 nm

308

further supporting the idea that non-enveloped viruses may require higher doses of

309

visible light39.

310

Our study was conducted using a neutral liquid media composed of PBS without any

311

photosensitizers and we were able to show that visible light can indeed inactivate lipid-

312

enveloped viruses, differing from the theory that states that photosensitizers are a

38

37

. Nevertheless, both

313

requirement for inactivation. Other studies which used visible light-based irradiation

314

have shown similar results in the absence of photosensitizers, indicating the possibility

315

of an alternative inactivation mechanism23, 25, 30. Studies have proposed two theories for

316

this observation primarily due to non-405nm wavelengths emitted by the source: 1)

317

some amount of 420-430 nm emitted from the source is contributing to the viral

318

inactivation

319

wavelength is known to create oxidative stress upon viral capsids41.

320

Longer wavelengths, such as 420-430nm, have shown inactivation of the murine

321

leukemia virus (MRV-A)

322

lamp with optical filters to selectively identify the spectrum primarily responsible with

323

their results. Unfortunately, they did not quantify the amount of light (using radiometric

324

units) within the spectrum of interest used to irradiate the virus. While transmission

325

profile of the filters used were provided, it does not take into account the spectral

326

composition of the source itself making any direct quantitative comparison between our

327

studies impossible. It is interesting to note that they did observe viral inactivation in

328

their controls from wavelengths less than 420nm confirming the qualitative findings of

329

our study without confirming the specific use of 405nm. This suggests that the viral

330

inactivation is a likely a broad response (> 20nm) with relative contributions unique to

331

the chemistry of each organism. They also considered much longer exposures (~7

332

days) and much higher illuminance (> 200 lux) than that used in our study although this

333

is again difficult to compare given the lack of radiometric quantification of their light

334

source. It is important to note that the control samples used in our study were exposed

335

to the same overhead (non-405nm) lights as the irradiated samples and our results are

40

, and 2) the presence of UV-A (390 nm) within the source. This

40

. While this is an intriguing study, it used a broad-spectrum

336

the observed difference between the two demonstrating the contribution from 405nm

337

over and above that potentially from 420-430nm. Future experiments can further

338

quantify the potential effect.

339

The other theory, potential UV-A irradiation, was historically applied to lamp-based

340

sources with broad spectral (> 100nm) outputs. Again, the use of LED technology

341

addresses this question as the peak irradiance at 390nm of the device used in this

342

study was < 1% of its peak irradiance at 405nm without the need for any additional

343

filtration. Future experiments can further quantify the potential effect.

344

The results obtained suggest that the performance of visible light against SARS-CoV-2

345

is similar to organisms commonly found in the environment such as S. aureus.

346

Previous studies have shown that the visible light irradiance levels used in this study

347

(0.035 mWcm-2 to 0.6 mWcm-2) reduce bacteria levels in occupied rooms and improve

348

outcomes for surgical procedures. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that visible light

349

might be an effective disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, this

350

disinfection can operate continuously as it is safe for humans based upon the exposure

351

guidelines in IEC 6247142. This means that once it has been in use for a period of time,

352

the environment will be cleaner and safer the next time it is occupied by humans.

353

One limitation of this study is that the inactivation assays were performed in static liquid

354

media as opposed to aerosolized droplets. While the use of visible light in air

355

disinfection has been briefly studied where it was shown that its effectiveness increased

356

approximately 4-fold43, further studies involving dynamic aerosolization are needed to

357

better understand the true potential of visible light mediated viral inactivation.

358

In any case, our study shows the increased susceptibility of enveloped respiratory viral

359

pathogens to 405 nm mediated inactivation in the absence of photosensitizers. The

360

irradiances used in this study are very low and might be easily applied to safely and

361

continuously disinfect occupied areas within hospitals, schools, restaurants, offices and

362

other locations.
