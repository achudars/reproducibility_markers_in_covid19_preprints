ABSTRACT
An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease,
has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social
and economic disruption1,2. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there
vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular
details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral
proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinitypurification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human
protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host
factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical
compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The
identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into
effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and
other deadly coronavirus strains.

MAIN
The current pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a respiratory disease that has led to over
290,000 confirmed cases and 12,000 fatalities in over 100 countries since its emergence in late 20193,4, is
caused by a novel virus strain, SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Coronaviruses infecting humans historically included several mild
common cold viruses e.g. hCoV-OC43, HKU, 229E5. However, over the past two decades, highly pathogenic
human coronaviruses have emerged, including SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003 with 8,000 cases worldwide and a
death rate of ~10%, and MERS-CoV in 2012, which caused 2,500 confirmed cases and a fatality rate of 36%6.
Infection with these highly pathogenic coronaviruses can result in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),
which may lead to long-term reduction in lung function, arrhythmia, and death. Compared to MERS or SARS7,8,
SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently, making it difficult to contain and increasing its pandemic
potential. To devise therapeutic strategies to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is crucial to develop a
comprehensive understanding of how this coronavirus hijacks the host during the course of infection, and to
apply this knowledge towards developing both new drugs and repurposing existing ones.
So far, no clinically available antiviral drugs have been developed for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV.
Clinical trials are ongoing for treatment of COVID-19 with the nucleotide analog RNA-dependent RNA

Polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor remdesivir9–11, and recent data suggests a new nucleotide analog may be effective
against SARS-CoV-2 infection in laboratory animals12. Clinical trials on several vaccine candidates are also
underway13, as well as trials of repurposed host-directed compounds inhibiting the human protease TMPRSS214.
We believe there is great potential in systematically exploring the host dependencies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
to identify other host proteins already targeted with existing drugs. Therapies targeting the host-virus interface,
where mutational resistance is arguably less likely, could potentially present durable, broad-spectrum treatment
modalities15. Unfortunately, our minimal knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection precludes
a comprehensive evaluation of small molecule candidates for host-directed therapies. We sought to address this
knowledge gap by systematically mapping the interaction landscape between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human
proteins.

Cloning and expression of predicted SARS-CoV-2 proteins
Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates suggests that the 30kb genome encodes as many as 14 open
reading frames (Orfs). The 5’ Orf1a / Orf1ab encodes polyproteins, which are auto-proteolytically processed into
16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) which form the replicase / transcriptase complex (RTC). The RTC consists
of multiple enzymes, including the papain-like protease (Nsp3), the main protease (Nsp5), the Nsp7-Nsp8
primase complex, the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), a helicase/triphosphatase (Nsp13),
an exoribonuclease (Nsp14), an endonuclease (Nsp15), and N7- and 2’O-methyltransferases
(Nsp10/Nsp16)1,16,17. At the 3’ end of the viral genome, as many as 13 Orfs are expressed from nine predicted
sub-genomic RNAs. These include four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and
Nucleocapsid (N)17, and nine putative accessory factors (Fig. 1a)1,16. In genetic composition, the SARS-CoV-2
genome is very similar to SARS-CoV: each has an Orf1ab encoding 16 predicted Nsps and each has the four
typical coronavirus structural proteins. However, they differ in their complement of 3’ open reading frames:
SARS-CoV-2 possesses an Orf3b and Orf10 with limited detectable protein homology to SARS-CoV16, and its
Orf8 is intact while SARS-CoV encodes Orf8a and Orf8b (Fig. 1b)1,16,18.
Mature Nsps and all predicted proteins expressed from other SARS-CoV-2 Orfs (27 proteins plus one mutant)
were codon optimized and cloned into a mammalian expression vector with a 2xStrep tag fused to either the Nor C-terminus19. Protein expression plasmids were transfected into human HEK293T cells, which were incubated
for 40 hours before lysis in a mild detergent buffer. Viral proteins were affinity purified using MagStrep beads.
Beads were washed, on-bead digestion was performed overnight, and peptides were desalted and analyzed by
protein mass spectrometry. High confidence interactors were identified using SAINTexpress and the MiST
algorithm19,20.
To verify viral protein expression, we performed an anti-Strep western blot on input cell lysate, and with the
exception of Nsp4, Nsp6, Nsp11, and Orf3b, we observed bands consistent with predicted protein sizes (24 of
28 constructs). Despite the lack of detection via western blot we were able to detect expression of viral peptides
Nsp4, Nsp6, and Orf3b in the proteomic analysis. The fourth construct not confirmed by western blot, the small
peptide Nsp11, had a predicted molecular mass of 4.8 kDa (including tag) but an apparent mass of approximately
30 kDa (Fig. 1c). SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b has limited homology to SARS-CoV Orf3b16, and its restricted expression
as measured by both western blot and AP-MS may indicate that it is either not a bonafide protein coding gene
or that it requires co-expression of other SARS-CoV-2 proteins for robust expression. Ultimately we proceeded
with analysis of protein interaction data from 27 baits, and excluded Orf7b, which had high prey detection
background (Fig. 1d).

Global analysis of SARS-CoV-2 host interacting proteins
Our affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis identified 332 protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2
proteins and human proteins (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 1, 2; also see Fig. 3). We studied
the interacting human proteins in regards to their cell biology, anatomical expression patterns, expression
changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection21 and in relation to other maps of pathogen interacting proteins19,22–30(Fig.
2a). For each of the viral proteins, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (Fig. 2b, Extended Data
Fig. 2), identifying the major cell biological processes of the interacting proteins, including lipoprotein metabolism
(S), nuclear transport (Nsp7), and biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein (Nsp8). To discover potential binding
interfaces, we performed an enrichment for domain families within the interacting proteins of each viral bait
(Extended Data Fig. 3). As examples, we note the enrichment of DNA polymerase domains in the interactors of
Nsp1 and the enrichment of bromodomains and extra-terminal domain (BET) family for interactors of E (see also
Figs. 3, 4). In line with the latter, the interactors of E are also enriched in genes annotated for binding to acetylated
histones (Fig. 2b).
While the cells used for these AP-MS experiments, HEK-293T kidney cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2
infection31, they do not represent the primary physiological site of infection. Therefore, we asked whether the
host proteins bound by SARS-CoV-2 might be specifically relevant to the virus’s typical environment, lung tissue.
We tested if the interacting human proteins were preferentially highly expressed, at the protein level, in any of
29 human tissues32, which identified the lung as the tissue with the highest expression of the prey proteins
relative to the average proteome (Fig. 2c). In accordance to this, when compared to overall RefSeq gene
expression in the lung (median=3.198 TPM), the interacting proteins were more highly expressed (median=25.52
TPM, p=0.0007; t-test, Extended Data Fig. 4) and were also specifically enriched in lung expression relative to
other tissues (Extended Data Fig. 5). These data support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially hijacks
proteins available in lung tissue and the degree of tissue specific expression may facilitate the drug targeting of
host factors with fewer systemic side-effects; this observation is particularly compelling given its derivation from
HEK293 cells, which are themselves not lung derived. To further study the relevance of our map, we analyzed
the recently reported protein abundance changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection33. We calculated, when possible,
the correlation between changes in abundance of viral proteins and their human interaction partners across the
4 timepoints reported. Interacting pairs tended to have stronger correlated changes than other pairs of viralhuman proteins (Fig. 2d, KS test p-value=4.8e−05), arguing that the AP-MS derived interactions are of high
relevance for the target tissue and the infection context. We compared our SARS-CoV-2 interaction map with
those derived for 10 other pathogens (Fig. 2e), identifying West Nile Virus (WNV)23 and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb)27 as having the most similar host protein interaction partners. The association with Mtb is
particularly interesting considering it also infects lung tissue.
Finally, we studied the evolutionary properties of the host proteins. Successful virus spread in a diverse
population in theory could be facilitated by a reliance on conserved host molecular components, therefore we
analyzed the conservation of the human proteins identified in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Relative to a control
sample of genes, the 332 SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins had depleted missense and premature stop
mutations in gnomAD34, indicating that they have reduced genetic variation in human populations (Extended
Data Fig. 6).
The SARS-CoV-2 interactome reveals novel aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology

Our study highlighted interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins with a range of functions
including DNA replication (Nsp1), epigenetic and gene expression regulators (Nsp5, Nsp8, Nsp13, E), vesicle
trafficking (Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp15, Orf3a, E, M, Orf8), lipid modification (Spike), RNA processing
and regulation (Nsp8, N), ubiquitin ligases (Orf10), signaling (Nsp8, Nsp13, N, Orf9b), nuclear transport
machinery (Nsp9, Nsp15, Orf6), cytoskeleton (Nsp1, Nsp13), mitochondria (Nsp4, Nsp8, Orf9c), and
extracellular matrix (Nsp9) (Fig. 3).
A prominent number of interactions were related to lipid modifications and vesicle trafficking. Interestingly, the
Spike protein (S) interacts with the GOLGA7-ZDHHC5 acyl-transferase complex, which likely mediates
palmitoylation on its cytosolic tail (see also Appendix)35. Palmitoylation has been reported to facilitate membrane
fusion by SARS-CoV Spike and suggests a potential target for therapeutic inhibition36. Interestingly, ZDHHC5
also has a published role in allowing anthrax toxin to enter cells, suggesting that inhibition of this enzyme could
have broad utility37. Host interactions of Nsp8 (signal recognition particle), Orf8 (endoplasmic reticulum quality
control), M (ER structural morphology proteins), Nsp13 (golgins) may facilitate the dramatic reconfiguration of
ER/Golgi trafficking during coronavirus infection, and interactions in peripheral compartments by Nsp6 and M
(vacuolar ATPase), Nsp7 (Rabs), Nsp10 (AP2), E (AP3), and Orf3a (HOPS) may also modify endomembrane
compartments to favor coronavirus replication.
We identified protein-protein interactions with the main protease Nsp5, using both wild-type and catalytic dead
(C145A) constructs. For wild-type Nsp5, we identified one high-confidence interaction, the epigenetic regulator
histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and predicted a cleavage site between the HDAC domain and the nuclear
localization sequence, suggesting that Nsp5 may inhibit HDAC2 transport into the nucleus (Extended Data Fig.
7), potentially impacting the published functions of HDAC2 in mediating inflammation and interferon
response38,39. We also identified an interaction of Nsp5 (C145A) with tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), which
is responsible for synthesis of the dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) base modification on both nuclear and
mitochondrial tRNAs40. We predict TRMT1 is also cleaved by Nsp5, removing its zinc finger and nuclear
localization signal and likely resulting in an exclusively mitochondrial localization (Extended Data Fig. 7).
SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple innate immune pathways
We identified a number of cellular proteins implicated in innate immune signaling that are targeted by several
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Interestingly, we found that Nsp13 interacts with two key players of IFN signaling
pathway including TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and TANK-binding kinase 1-binding protein 1
(TBKBP1/SINTBAD). SINTBAD acts as a critical adaptor protein between TBK1 and IKKi and therefore mediates
induction of IRF-dependent transcription41. Further, Nsp13 interacts with multiple proteins of the TLE family,
which are known to modulate NF-κB inflammatory response42–44. RNF41/Nrdp1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase is targeted
by Nsp15 protein which promotes activation of TBK1 and IRF3 and therefore increases type I interferon
production45. Two other E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM59 and MIB1 regulate antiviral innate immune signaling and
are usurped by Orf3a and Nsp9, respectively46,47. Orf9c protein was found to interact with multiple proteins that
modulate IkB kinase and NF-kB signaling pathway including NLRX1, F2RL1, NDFIP248–50. We also found that
Orf9b interacts with a mitochondrial import receptor, Tom70, which acts as an essential adaptor linking MAVS
to TBK1/IRF3, resulting in the activation of IRF-351.
N targets stress granule protein G3BP1, an essential antiviral protein which is known to induce innate immune
response through multiple mechanisms52–54. Common among coronaviridae is the manipulation of stress
granules (SG) and related RNA biology, possibly leading to suppression of stress granules and host translation
shutoff55. This functionality seems to benefit viral replication, as stress granules are inhibitory to replication of
MERS-CoV56 and other viruses57. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) interactome includes many host mRNA

binding proteins, including the SG related factors G3BP1/2, the mTOR translational repressors LARP1, and the
protein kinases CK2 (Fig. 4a). SGs are induced by protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α
upon viral dsRNA recognition57. Promoting G3BP aggregation via the eIF4A inhibitor Zotatafin58,59 or reducing
SG disassembly by Silmitasertib inhibition of CK260 warrant investigation for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin disrupts the binding of LARP1 to mTORC161 and has been shown to reduce MERS
infection by ~60% in vitro62, another drug that could be tested for repurposing.
Orf6 of SARS-CoV has been shown to play a role in antagonizing host interferon signaling63; we identified a
novel, high-confidence interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 and NUP98-RAE1, an interferon-inducible mRNA
nuclear export complex64 that is hijacked or degraded by multiple viruses, including VSV, Influenza-A, KSHV,
and Polio, and is a restriction factor for Influenza-A infection58,60,62,65. The X-ray structure of VSV M protein
complexed with NUP98-RAE166 reveals key binding interactions that include a buried methionine residue on the
M-protein packing into a hydrophobic pocket in RAE1, as well as neighboring acidic residues interacting with a
basic patch on the NUP98-RAE1 complex (Fig 4b). These binding features are also present in a conserved motif
in the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8), providing a structural hypothesis
for the observed SARS-CoV-2–NUP98-RAE1 interaction. Moreover, a peptide containing the binding region of
the VSV M protein was previously shown to outcompete RNA binding to NUP98-RAE1, suggesting a role in
interfering with mRNA export66. These observations suggest a viral strategy to target the RNA nuclear export
activity of RAE1, potentially revealing a mode of interferon antagonism by SARS-CoV-2.
The novel Orf10 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with a Cullin ubiquitin ligase complex
Viruses commonly hijack ubiquitination pathways for replication and pathogenesis67. The novel Orf10 of SARSCoV-2 interacts with multiple members of a Cullin 2 (CUL2) RING E3 ligase complex (Fig. 4c), specifically the
CUL2ZYG11B complex. ZYG11B, a substrate adapter of CUL2 that targets substrates with exposed N-terminal
glycines for degradation65, is the highest scoring protein in the Orf10 interactome suggesting its direct interaction
with Orf10. Orf10 may bind to the CUL2ZYG11B complex and hijack it for ubiquitination and degradation of
restriction factors. The ubiquitin transfer to a substrate requires neddylation of CUL2 via NEDD8-activating
enzyme (NAE), a druggable target that can be inhibited by the small molecule Pevonedistat68 (Fig. 4c).
SARS-CoV-2 envelope interacts with bromodomain proteins
Surprisingly, we find that the transmembrane protein E binds to the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2 and
BRD4 (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 9), potentially disrupting BRD-histone binding by mimicking histone structure.
BRD2 is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) domain family whose members bind acetylated
histones to regulate gene transcription69. The N-terminus of histone 2A shares local sequence similarity over an
alpha-helix of approximately 15 residues, some of which are in a transmembrane segment, of Protein E (Fig.
4d). Moreover, this matching region of the histone is spanned by acetylated lysine residues shown to bind
BRD270. This analysis may suggest that Protein E mimics the histone to disrupt its interaction with BRD2, thus
inducing changes in host's protein expression that are beneficial to the virus.
For a more comprehensive overview of the virus-host interactions we detected, see Supplemental Discussion.
Identification of existing drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 human host factors.
To identify small molecules targeting human proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome, we sought ligands known
to interact with the human proteins, often directly but also by pathway and complexes, drawing on
chemoinformatics databases and analyses (Methods). Molecules were prioritized by the statistical significance
of the interaction between the human and viral proteins; by their status as approved drugs, investigational new
drugs (INDs, “clinical” in Table 1a,b), or as preclinical candidates; by their apparent selectivity; and by their

availability (for purchase availability notes, see Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). Chemoinformatics searches
yielded 15 approved drugs, four investigational new drugs (clinical), and 18 pre-clinical candidates (Table 1a),
while specialist knowledge revealed 12 approved drugs, 10 investigational new drugs (clinical), and 10 preclinical
candidates (Table 1b). Of the 332 human targets that interact with the viral bait proteins with high significance,
63 have drugs/INDs/preclinical molecules that modulate them (Fig. 3). If we reduce our protein interaction score
threshold slightly, we find an additional four human targets, revealing a total of 67 human targets (Supplementary
Tables 3 and 4). The drug-human protein associations may be overlaid on top of our protein interaction network,
highlighting potentially druggable host interactions (Fig. 5a).
There are several mechanistically interesting, and potentially disease-relevant drug-target interactions revealed
in the chemoinformatic network (Fig. 5a). Among them, the well-known chemical probe, Bafilomycin A1, is a
potent inhibitor of the V1-ATPase, subunits of which interact with Nsp6 and M. Bafilomycin’s inhibition of this
cotransporter acts to prevent the acidification of the lysosome, inhibiting autophagy and endosome trafficking
pathways, which may impact the viral life-cycle. Similarly, drugs exist to target several well-known epigenetic
regulators prominent among the human interactors, including HDAC2, BRD2 and BRD4, which interact with viral
proteins nsp5 and E, respectively (Figs. 3 and 5a). The approved drug Valproic acid (an anticonvulsant) and the
pre-clinical candidate Apicidin inhibit HDAC2 with affinities of 62 μM and 120 nM, respectively. Clinical
compounds ABBV-744 and CPI-0610 act on BRD2/4, with an affinity of 2 nM or 39 nM, respectively -- several
preclinical compounds also target bromodomain-containing proteins (Table 1a,b). As a final example, we were
intrigued to observe that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein interacts with the Sigma receptor, which is thought to
regulate ER stress response71. Similarly, the Sigma2 receptor interacted with the vial protein orf9. Both Sigma1
and Sigma2 are promiscuous receptors that interact with many non-polar, cationic drugs. We prioritized several
of these drugs based on potency or potential disease relevance, including the antipsychotic Haloperidol, which
binds in the low nM range to both receptors72, and Chloroquine, which is currently in clinical trials for COVID-19
and has mid-nM activity vs the Sigma1 receptor, and low μM activity against the Sigma2 receptor. Because
many patients are already treated with drugs that have off-target impact on Sigma receptors, associating clinical
outcomes accompanying treatment with these drugs may merit investigation, a point to which we return. Finally,
in addition to the druggable host factors, a few of which we have highlighted here, the SARS-CoV-2-human
interactome reveals many traditionally “undruggable” targets. Among these, for instance, are components of the
centriole such as CEP250, which interacts with the viral Nsp13. Intriguingly, a very recent patent disclosure
revealed a natural product, WDB002, that directly and specifically targets CEP250. As a natural product,
WDB002 would likely be harder to source than the molecules on which we have focused on here, but may well
merit investigation. Similarly, other “undruggable” targets may be revealed to have compounds that could usefully
perturb the viral-human interaction network, and act as leads to therapeutics.
Beyond direct interactions, several drug-pathway interactions seemed noteworthy. The human purine
biosynthesis enzyme Inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH2) interacts with the viral protein nsp14.
Several chemically diverse compounds inhibit IMPDH2, including the clinically approved mycophenolic acid (20
nM), the approved antiviral drug ribavirin (200 nM), and the investigational new drug Merimepodib (10 nM) (Table
1a). Intriguingly, the preclinical molecule Sanglifehrin A (Table 1b) is known to act as a molecular glue linking
IMPDH with cyclophilin A (Fig. 5b)73, which itself is implicated in viral capsid packaging, even though it itself is
not a human “prey” in the viral-human protein interactome. Similarly, direct viral-human interactions with proteins
regulated by the mTORC1 pathway, such as LARP1, and FKBP7, which interact with the viral N and Orf8
proteins, led us to inhibitors of mTORC1, even though that kinase itself is not found to directly interact with a
viral protein (Fig. 5c). Sapanisertib and rapamycin are low nM inhibitors of mTORC1, while metformin is an
indirect modulator of this protein complex.

Discussion
We have used affinity purification-mass spectrometry to identify 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2human PPIs. We find the viral proteins connected to a wide array of biological processes, including protein
trafficking, translation, transcription and ubiquitination regulation. Using a combination of a systematic
chemoinformatic drug search with a pathway centric analysis, we uncovered close to 70 different drugs and
compounds, including FDA approved drugs, compounds in clinical trials as well as preclinical compounds,
targeting parts of the resulting network. We are currently testing these compounds for antiviral activity and
encourage others to do the same as well as extract insights from the map that could have therapeutic value.
More generally, this proteomic/chemoinformatic analysis is not only identifying drug and clinical
molecules that might perturb the viral-human interactome, it gives these potentially therapeutic perturbations a
mechanistic context. Among those that may be infection relevant are the inhibition of lysosomal acidification and
trafficking with Bafilomycin A1, via inhibition of V-ATPase74, and modulation of the ER stress and the protein
unfolding response pathway by targeting the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptor by drugs like haloperidol (Fig. 5a,
Tables 1a,b). Indeed, several of the human proteins in the interactome are targeted by drugs that have emerged
phenotypically as candidate therapeutics for treating COVID-19, such as chloroquine75,76. While we do not
pretend to have identified the molecular basis of chloroquine’s putative activity, we do note that this drug targets
the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors at mid-nM and low μM concentrations, respectively. Similarly, antibiotics like
azithromycin have also been mooted as treatments for COVID-19. While this too remains to be demonstrated,
we note that Azithromycin has off-target activity against human mitochondrial ribosomes, components of which
interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein (MRPS5, MRPS27, MRPS2, and MRPS25). Other antibiotics that
also have an off-target effect on mitochondrial ribosomes, such as chloramphenicol, tigecycline, and
Linezolid77,78 may also merit study for efficacy. Indeed, this logic may be extended. Many COVID-19 patients
will be on the drugs identified here, treating pre-existing conditions. It may be useful to correlate clinical
outcomes with the taking of these drugs, cross-referencing with the networks described here. In some senses,
this is already occurring phenomenologically, leading to concerns about ACE inhibitors such as captopril and
enalapril, and for NSAIDs. What this study provides is a systematic schema for clinical/drug associations going
forward, giving them a mechanistic context that allows investigators to seek them directly.
Systematic validation using genetic-based approaches79,80 will be key to determine the functional
relevance of these interactions and if the human proteins are being used by the virus or are fighting off infection,
information that would inform future pharmacological studies. It is important to note that pharmacological
intervention with the agents we identified in this study could be either detrimental or beneficial for infection. For
instance, the HDAC2 inhibitors may compound the potential action of the Nsp5 protease to hydrolyze this human
protein. Future work will involve generation of protein-protein interaction maps in different human cell types, as
well as bat cells, and the study of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the less virulent
OC435, data that will allow for valuable cross-species and viral evolution studies. Targeted biochemical and
structural studies will also be crucial for a deeper understanding of the viral-host complexes, which will inform
more targeted drug design.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, we have previously utilized global affinity purification-mass spectrometry (APMS) analysis to map the host-pathogen interfaces of a number of human pathogens including Ebola22, Dengue30,
Zika30, Herpesvirus29, Hepatitis C28, Tuberculosis27, Chlamydia26 , Enteroviruses25, HIV19, HPV24, and West Nile
Fever23. Excitingly, we have uncovered both shared and unique mechanisms in which these pathogens co-opt
the host machinery during the course of infection. Although host-directed therapy is often not explored for

serve as targets that would harbor pan-pathogenic activity so that when the next virus undergoes zoonosis, we
will have treatment options available.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genome annotation. The genbank sequence for SARS-CoV-2 isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020, accession
MN985325, was downloaded on January 24, 2020. In total, we identified 29 open reading frames and
proteolytically mature proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-21,16. Proteolytic products resulting from Nsp3 and Nsp5mediated cleavage of the Orf1a / Orf1ab polyprotein were predicted based on the protease specificity of SARSCoV proteases90, and 16 predicted nonstructural proteins (Nsps) were subsequently cloned (Nsp1-Nsp16). For
the proteases Nsp3 (papain-like / Plpro) and Nsp5 (3Clike / 3CLpro), we also designed catalytic dyad/triad
mutants: Nsp3 C857A91 and Nsp5 C145A 92,93. Open reading frames at the 3’ end of the viral genome annotated
in the original genbank file included 4 Structural proteins: S, E, M, N, and the additional open reading frames
Orf3a, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf8, and Orf10. Based on analysis of open reading frames in the genome and comparisons
with other annotated SARS-CoV open reading frames, we annotated a further four open reading frames: Orf3b,
Orf7b, Orf9b, and Orf9c.
Cell culture. HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Corning) supplemented with
10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Corning) and maintained
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Transfection. For each affinity purification, ten million HEK293T cells were plated per 15-cm dish and
transfected with up to 15 μg of individual Strep-tagged expression constructs after 20-24 hours. Total plasmid
was normalized to 15 μg with empty vector and complexed with PolyJet Transfection Reagent (SignaGen
Laboratories) at a 1:3 μg:μl ratio of plasmid to transfection reagent based on manufacturer’s recommendations.
After more than 38 hours, cells were dissociated at room temperature using 10 ml Dulbecco’s Phosphate
Buffered Saline without calcium and magnesium (D-PBS) supplemented with 10 mM EDTA for at least 5 minutes
and subsequently washed with 10 ml D-PBS. Each step was followed by centrifugation at 200 xg, 4°C for 5
minutes. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and stored at - 80°C. At least three biological replicates were
independently prepared for affinity purification.
Affinity purification. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice for 15-20 minutes and suspended in 1 ml Lysis
Buffer [IP Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4°C, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet
P 40 Substitute (NP40; Fluka Analytical) and cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease and PhosSTOP phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Roche)]. Samples were then frozen on dry ice for 10-20 minutes and partially thawed at 37°C
before incubation on a tube rotator for 30 minutes at 4°C and centrifugation at 13,000 xg, 4°C for 15 minutes to
pellet debris. After reserving 50 μl lysate, up to 48 samples were arrayed into a 96-well Deepwell plate for affinity
purification on the KingFisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Scientific) as follows: MagStrep “type3” beads
(30 μl; IBA Lifesciences) were equilibrated twice with 1 ml Wash Buffer (IP Buffer supplemented with 0.05%
NP40) and incubated with 0.95 ml lysate for 2 hours. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml Wash Buffer and
then once with 1 ml IP Buffer. To directly digest bead-bound proteins as well as elute proteins with biotin, beads
were manually suspended in IP Buffer and divided in half before transferring to 50 μl Denaturation-Reduction
Buffer (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT) and 50 μl 1x Buffer BXT (IBA Lifesciences) dispensed into
a single 96-well KF microtiter plate, respectively. Purified proteins were first eluted at room temperature for 30
minutes with constant shaking at 1,100 rpm on a ThermoMixer C incubator. After removing eluates, on-bead
digestion proceeded (below). Strep-tagged protein expression in lysates and enrichment in eluates were
assessed by western blot and silver stain, respectively. The KingFisher Flex Purification System was placed in
the cold room and allowed to equilibrate to 4°C overnight before use. All automated protocol steps were
performed using the slow mix speed and the following mix times: 30 seconds for equilibration/wash steps, 2
hours for binding, and 1 minute for final bead release. Three 10 second bead collection times were used between
all steps.
On-bead digestion. Bead-bound proteins were denatured and reduced at 37°C for 30 minutes and after bringing
to room temperature, alkylated in the dark with 3 mM iodoacetamide for 45 minutes and quenched with 3 mM
DTT for 10 minutes. Proteins were then incubated at 37°C, initially for 4 hours with 1.5 μl trypsin (0.5 μg/μl;
Promega) and then another 1-2 hours with 0.5 μl additional trypsin. To offset evaporation, 15 μl 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0 were added before trypsin digestion. All steps were performed with constant shaking at 1,100 rpm on a
ThermoMixer C incubator. Resulting peptides were combined with 50 μl 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 used to rinse
beads and acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (0.5% final, pH < 2.0). Acidified peptides were desalted for MS
analysis using a BioPureSPE Mini 96-Well Plate (20mg PROTO 300 C18; The Nest Group, Inc.) according to
standard protocols.
Mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis. Samples were re-suspended in 4% formic acid, 2%
acetonitrile solution, and separated by a reversed-phase gradient over a nanoflow C18 column (Dr. Maisch).
Each sample was analyzed on two different mass spectrometers. First, a 75 min acquisition, in which peptides
were directly injected via a Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo) into a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo), with
all MS1 and MS2 spectra collected in the orbitrap. For all acquisitions, QCloud was used to control instrument
longitudinal performance during the project94. All proteomic data was searched against the human proteome
(uniprot reviewed sequences downloaded February 28th, 2020), EGFP sequence, and the SARS-CoV-2 protein

sequences using the default settings for MaxQuant95,96. Detected peptides and proteins were filtered to 1% false
discovery rate in MaxQuant, and identified proteins were then subjected to protein-protein interaction scoring
with both SAINTexpress20 and MiST19,97. We applied a two step filtering strategy to determine the final list of
reported interactors which relied on two different scoring stringency cutoffs. In the first step, we chose all protein
interactions that possess a MiST score ≥ 0.7, a SAINTexpress BFDR ≤ 0.05 and an average spectral count ≥ 2.
For all proteins that fulfilled these criteria we extracted information about stable protein complexes they
participate in from the CORUM98 database of known protein complexes. In the second step we then relaxed the
stringency and recovered additional interactors that (1) form complexes with interactors determined in filtering
step 1 and (2) fulfill the following criteria: MiST score ≥ 0.6, SAINTexpress BFDR ≤ 0.05 and average spectral
counts ≥ 2. Proteins that fulfilled filtering criteria in either step 1 or step 2 were considered to be HC-PPIs and
visualized with cytoscape99. Using this filtering criteria, nearly all of our baits recovered a number of HC-PPIs in
close alignment with previous datasets reporting an average of ~6 PPIs per bait100. However, for a subset of
baits (Orf8, Nsp8, Nsp13, and orf9c) we observed a much higher number of PPIs passing these filtering criteria.
For these four baits, the MiST scoring was instead performed using an larger in-house database of 87 baits that
were prepared and processed in an analogous manner to this SARS-CoV-2 dataset. This was done to provide
a more comprehensive collection of baits for comparison, to minimize the classification of non-specifically binding
background proteins as HC-PPIs. All mass spectrometry raw data and search results files have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier
PXD018117101,102. PPI networks have also been uploaded to NDEx.
Gene Ontology Over-representation Analysis. The targets of each bait were tested for enrichment of Gene
Ontology (GO Biological Process) terms. The over-representation analysis (ORA) was performed using the
enricher function of clusterProfiler package in R with default parameters. The gene ontology terms were obtained
from the c5 category of Molecular Signature Database (MSigDBv6.1). Significant GO terms (1% FDR) were
identified and further refined to select non-redundant terms. In order to select non-redundant gene sets, we first
constructed a GO term tree based on distances (1-Jaccard Similarity Coefficients of shared genes) between the
significant terms. The GO term tree was cut at a specific level (h=0.99) to identify clusters of non-redundant gene
sets. For a bait with multiple significant terms belonging to the same cluster, we selected the broadest term i.e.
largest gene set size.
Virus Interactome Similarity Analysis. Interactome similarity was assessed by comparing the number of
shared human interacting proteins between pathogen pairs, using a hypergeometric test to calculate
significance. The background gene set for the test consisted of all unique proteins detected by mass
spectrometry across all pathogens (N=10,181 genes).
Orf6 peptide modeling. The proposed interaction between Orf6 and the NUP98-RAE1 complex was modeled
in PyRosetta 4103 (release v2020.02-dev61090) using the crystal structure of Vesicular stomatitis virus matrix
(M) protein bound to NUP98-RAE1 as a template66 (PDB 4OWR downloaded from the PDB-REDO server104).
The M protein chain (C) was truncated after residue 54 to restrict the model to the putative interaction motif in
Orf6 (M protein residues 49-54, sequence DEMDTH). These residues were mutated to the Orf6 sequence,
QPMEID, using the mutate_residue function in the module pyrosetta.toolbox, without repacking at this initial
step. After all six residues were mutated, the full model was relaxed to a low energy conformation using the
FastRelax protocol in the module pyrosetta.rosetta.protocols.relax. FastRelax was run with constraints to starting
coordinates and scored with the ref2015 score function. The resulting model was inspected for any large

energetic penalties associated with the modeled peptide residues or those NUP98 and RAE1 residues
interacting with the peptide, and was found to have none. The model was visualized in PyMOL (The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.4 Schrödinger, LLC.).
CUL2ZYG11B homology model generation. The CRL2ZYG11B homology model was built with Swissmodel105 and
Modeller106 by using the homology template of each domain from PDB database (PDB codes: 4b8o, 5jh5,1g03,
and 6r7n). The ZYG11B model has two structured domains: a leucine rich repeat (LRR) and Armadillo Repeat
(ARM) at the N and C-terminus respectively. The linker between each domain was not modelled due to high
flexibility between residues 32 to 49 and residues 304 to 322. Putative protein interaction surfaces on ZYG11B
were modelled based on contiguous surface exposed residues that are conserved in ZYG11B orthologues from
C. elegans to H. sapiens (ZY11B_HUMAN; ZY11B_MOUSE; F1M8P2_RAT; ZYG11_XENLA; ZYG11_DANRE;
ZYG11_CAEEL) and located at typical substrate binding sites in the homologous structures of LRR and ARM
domain co-complexes.
Alignment of Protein E and Histone H2A. In order to align protein E and histone H2A, the structure of the
protein E SARS-CoV homolog (PDB ID: 2MM4) was compared to the human nucleosome structure (PDB ID:
6K1K). Protein E was structurally aligned to the histone subunits using Pymol’s “align” function
(https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Align). Align performs a sequence alignment followed by a structural

during the fit. The best superposition was obtained for H2A residues 49-60 & 63-70 and Protein E residues 2544 at an RMSD of 2.8Å, as reported in Figure 4d.
Chemoinformatic Analysis of SARS-CoV2 Interacting Partners. To identify drugs and reagents that
modulate the 332 host factors interacting with SARS-CoV-2-HEK293T (MiST >= 0.70), we used two
approaches: 1) a chemoinformatic analysis of open-source chemical databases and 2) a target- and pathwayspecific literature search, drawing on specialist knowledge within our group. Chemoinformatically, we retrieved
2,472 molecules from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (2020-3-12) that interacted with 30 human
"prey" proteins (38 approved, 71 in clinical trials), and found 10,883 molecules (95 approved, 369 in clinical
trials) from the ChEMBL25 database107 (Supplementary Tables 5, 6). For both approaches, molecules were
prioritized on their FDA approval status, activity at the target of interest better than 1 μM, and commercial
availability, drawing on the ZINC database108. FDA approved molecules were prioritized except when clinical
candidates or preclinical research molecules had substantially better selectivity or potency on-target. In some
cases, we considered molecules with indirect mechanisms of action on the general pathway of interest based
solely on literature evidence (e.g., captopril modulates ACE2 indirectly via its direct interaction with Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme, ACE). Finally, we predicted 6 additional molecules (2 approved, 1 in clinical trials) for
proteins with MIST scores between 0.7-0.6 to viral baits (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). Complete methods
can be found here (www.github.com/momeara/BioChemPantry/vignette/COVID19).
