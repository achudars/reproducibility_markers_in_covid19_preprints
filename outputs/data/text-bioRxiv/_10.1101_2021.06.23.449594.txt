Abstract

26

Companion animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sporadic cases of pet

27

infections have occurred in the United Kingdom. Here we present the first large-scale

28

serological survey of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in dogs and cats in the UK. Results

29

are reported for 688 sera (454 canine, 234 feline) collected by a large veterinary diagnostic

30

laboratory for routine haematology during three time periods; pre-COVID-19 (January

31

2020), during the first wave of UK human infections (April-May 2020) and during the second

32

wave of UK human infections (September 2020-February 2021). Both pre-COVID-19 sera

33

and those from the first wave tested negative. However, in sera collected during the second

34

wave, 1.4% (n=4) of dogs and 2.2% (n=2) cats tested positive for neutralising antibodies. The

35

low numbers of animals testing positive suggests pet animals are unlikely to be a major

36

reservoir for human infection in the UK. However, continued surveillance of in-contact

37

susceptible animals should be performed as part of ongoing population health surveillance

38

initiatives.

Introduction

44

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China at

45

the end of 2019 [1] and rapidly spread around the world. The main route of transmission

46

remains human-to-human. However, there is evidence that the virus can infect animals [2]

47

and it is important that we remain vigilant of such infections; particularly in companion

48

animals with whom humans often have close contact.

50

Although initially there were only sporadic cases of infection in cats and dogs [3-5], there

51

are now numerous reports of infection detected by RT-PCR or virus isolation [6-10],

52

including in the UK [11]. Evidence of infection of cats and dogs has also been provided by

53

the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in several studies; from Italy, France, Germany,

54

Croatia and China [12-17]. Experimental infections have shown that cats and, to a lesser

55

extent, dogs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats

56

[18-20]. Infections in companion animals appear to have occurred as a result of human-to-

57

animal transmission; however, the reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from farmed mink

58

to in-contact humans, cats and dogs [21, 22] and the detection of the virus in stray dogs and

59

cats [23, 24], suggest it is important to continue surveillance in companion animals. Here we

60

conducted a survey of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in cats and dogs attending UK

61

veterinary practices.

Methods

64

Samples

65

Canine and feline sera used in this study were obtained from the UK Virtual Biobank, which

66

uses health data from commercial diagnostic laboratories participating in the Small Animal

67

Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET) to target left over diagnostic samples in the

68

same laboratories for enhanced phenotypic and genomic analyses [25]. All samples were

69

residual sera remaining after routine diagnostic testing and were sent by the contributing

70

laboratory based on convenience within the following parameters: samples were requested

71

from UK cats and dogs collected over two time periods; March and April 2020 (early

72

pandemic) for both cats and dogs, then September 2020 to February 2021 for dogs, and

73

January 2021 for cats (late pandemic). Serum samples collected from the same laboratory in

74

early January 2020 were also tested as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were linked to

75

electronic health data for that sample (species, breed, sex, postcode of the submitting

76

veterinary practice, date received by the diagnostic laboratory) held in the SAVSNET

77

database, using a unique anonymised identifier. Data on SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptoms

78

was not available. Ethical approval to collect electronic health data (SAVSNET) and physical

79

samples from participating laboratories (National Virtual Biobank) was granted by the

80

Research Ethics Committee at the University of Liverpool (RETH000964).

81
82

Neutralising antibody detection in serum samples

83

Serum samples were screened for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies using the plaque

84

reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) as previously described [15], with the SARS-CoV-

85

2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020 isolate cultured in Vero E6 cells [26]. Briefly, sera

86

were heat inactivated at 56C for 30 mins and stored at -20C until use. DMEM containing

87

2% FBS was used to dilute sera ten-fold followed by serial two-fold dilution. SARS-CoV-2 at

88

800 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml was added to diluted sera and incubated at 37C for 1 h.

89

The virus/serum mixture was then inoculated onto Vero E6 cells, incubated at 37°C for 1 h,

90

and overlaid as in standard plaque assays [27]. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C and 5%

91

CO2, ﬁxed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.05% crystal violet solution. PRNT 80 was

92

determined by the highest dilution with 80% reduction in plaques compared to the control.

93

Samples with detectable neutralising antibody titre were repeated as technical replicates

94

for conﬁrmation. Where titres differed between technical replicates, the lowest dilution was

95

reported.

Results

98

A total of 732 samples were received from the diagnostic laboratory and tested for SARS-

99

CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. Linking of data to the samples found that 22 samples were

100

duplicates (duplicate samples gave the same result in each replicate and are therefore

101

reported as one sample). Seven samples were from animals with non-UK postcodes, two

102

samples did not have species data, two samples were received as dogs but were actually

103

from cats and were collected outside the two time periods of cat sample collection and

104

eleven samples were missing postcodes; these samples were excluded. Results are

105

therefore reported for 688 sera (454 canine, 234 feline) of which 558 (372 dogs, 186 cats)

106

were collected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 130 (82 dogs, 48 cats) were collected

107

from animals before the first confirmed human case in the UK (21st January 2020 [28]) - pre-

108

COVID-19 samples; these samples were distributed across the UK (Figure 1). Of the dog sera

109

collected during the pandemic, 0/85 (0%) collected in March/April 2020 and 4/287 (1.4%)

110

collected September 2020-February 2021 tested positive for neutralising antibodies with

111

titres ranging from 1:20 to 1:80. In cats, 0/96 (0%) sera collected in March/April 2020 tested

112

positive for neutralising antibodies and 2/90 (2.2%) collected in January 2021 tested positive

113

with titres of 1:40 and 1:80. Pre-COVID-19 sera from both dogs (n=82) and cats (n=48)

114

tested negative for neutralising antibodies. Positive samples in dogs were collected in

115

November 2020 (n=1), January 2021 (n=2) and February 2021 (n=1) and were collected in

116

Kent, Buckinghamshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire, respectively (Figure 1). The two

117

positive cats were collected in January 2021; one in Birmingham and the other in London

118

(Figure 1).

121

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in humans in China late in 2019, rapidly spreading across the world.

122

Studies of companion animals from several countries have shown that they too can be

123

infected with the virus. In the UK, there are sporadic reports of infection in cats and dogs

124

[11, 29], however, there has been no large scale test of infection. Here we show that a small

125

proportion of UK dogs and cats sampled at a time of active human transmission tested

126

positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies.

127
128

Sera from two time points during the pandemic were analysed. Sera collected early in the

129

pandemic, during March and April 2020, from both cats and dogs were negative for

130

neutralising antibodies. Previous studies using European samples have shown a low level of

131

infection, highest in Italy, where 3.3% (15/451) of dog sera and 5.8% (11/191) cat sera

132

collected between March and May 2020 had measurable neutralising antibody titres [15].

133

These samples were purposefully collected from regions of Italy with a high prevalence of

134

infection in humans, in some cases from households known to contain recently diagnosed

135

human cases. Our results in contrast, are more consistent with a survey from a similar

136

population of cats in Germany, that found 0/221 samples collected in April and May of 2020

137

to be positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA [13], and with a survey in the

138

Netherlands in April-May 2020, that found 0.4% of cats and 0.2% dogs to be seropositive

139

[30]. Lack of positive samples from this time period in the UK (April-May2020) likely reflects

140

the selection criteria of the animals assayed (undergoing routine haematological testing and

141

not selected based on location), and the relatively low rate of human disease at the time

142

compared to Italy.

144

In sera collected later in the pandemic, 4/287 (1.4%) dogs and 2/90 (2.2%) cats tested

145

positive. Positive dog samples were collected in November 2020 and January and February

146

of 2021. Positive cats were collected in January 2021. This is again broadly in line with a

147

recent German survey conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, showing a

148

seroprevalence of 1.36%, that the authors concluded corresponded with the rise of

149

reported cases in the human population, and was suggestive of ongoing transmission from

150

owners to their cats [14].

151
152

Cats and dogs can be infected with other coronaviruses, leading to the possibility that SARS-

153

CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in cats and dogs may result from previous infection with a

154

different virus. We and others have previously demonstrated a lack of cross-reactivity

155

between SARS-CoV-2 and samples containing antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine

156

enteric coronavirus (CeCoV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) [13, 15, 16]; all of

157

which are endemic in UK cats and dogs [31-33]. Here we also tested samples from UK cats

158

and dogs collected before the human index case in the UK (21st January 2020 [28]). All pre-

159

COVID-19 samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. Similar results

160

have been reported for both cats and dogs by others [30], suggesting that antibodies

161

produced following infection by cat and dog coronaviruses do not cross react with SARS-

162

CoV-2.

163
164

Here we made use of samples collected from a commercial diagnostic laboratory

165

contributing data to a voluntary national surveillance scheme (SAVSNET) to efficiently test

166

for evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK cats and dogs. The major limitations of such

167

a system are the relatively sparse data available for each sample such that individual

168

animals, that are not identifiable, may have been sampled twice or have come from the

169

same household. In addition, such samples lack detailed information on the health of the

170

animals and whether they were from a COVID-19-positive household. However, acquiring

171

such samples from the UK Virtual Biobank, offers a responsive resource for studying

172

national patterns of disease in UK pets [25].

173
174

We report here the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies during the second wave

175

of human infections in the UK. Other groups have previously reported that cats and dogs

176

can become infected, likely through their interactions with humans. Although animal-to-

177

animal transmission has been reported, for example on mink farms and in experimental

178

infections [18-20, 22, 34], the small numbers of companion animals testing positive in the

179

field suggest that pets are not currently acting as a significant reservoir for infection, and

180

that the pandemic will be controlled by measures largely focussed on minimising human-to-

181

human transmission. However, studies like that presented here strongly argue for continued

182

surveillance of in-contact, susceptible animal species, which will help determine whether in

183

the future, more targeted control measures are needed for pet animals, particularly in

184

regions that are gaining control of infection in their human populations.
