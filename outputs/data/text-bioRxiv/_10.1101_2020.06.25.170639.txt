Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters into the
cells through its spike proteins binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) protein and causes virus infection in host cells. Until now, there are no
available antiviral drugs have been reported that can effectively block virus infection.
The study aimed to discover the potential compounds to prevent viral spike proteins
to bind to the human ACE2 proteins from Taiwan Database of Extracts and
Compounds (TDEC) by structure-based virtual screening. In this study, to rapidly
discover potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, the molecular
docking calculation was performed by AutoDock Vina program. Herein, we found
that 39 potential compounds may have good binding affinities and can respectively
bind to the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in the prefusion
conformation and spike-ACE2 complex protein in silico. Among those compounds,
especially natural products thioflexibilolide A and candidine that were respectively
isolated from the soft corals Sinularia flexibilis and Phaius mishmensis may have
better binding affinity than others. This study provided the predictions that these
compounds may have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from entry
into cells.

Introduction
Recently, World Health Organization (WHO, https://www.who.int/) declared
that the outbreak spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes over 8 million reported cases and more than 4
hundred thousand deaths in 216 countries. Most of the coronaviruses cause only mild

respiratory distress[1, 2]. However, three coronaviruses namely the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, and the Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been found so far highly
pathogenic transmitted from animal to human[3]. The SARS-CoV in 2003 brings
about a 10 % case fatality rate (CFR), and MERS presented a CFR of about 34.4%[46]. The CFR for the novel coronavirus cannot be stated at the moment, as the
pandemic is not over yet, although 3.4% is estimated and one thing is apparent the
transmission rate of the infection is higher than the previous outbreaks[7].
The SARS-CoV-2 causes mainly severe acute respiratory distress by attacking
lung cells and other complications in the heart, kidney, brain, and spleen and
ultimately succumbed to a disastrous effect in coronavirus afflicted patients[8]. In this
hour of crisis, there is no available effective standard-of-care present to treat the
coronavirus affected patients. This makes an urgent need to find out agents to get
control over the pandemic. Scientists globally make an effort to do their best to come
up with effective therapeutic agents. So, to design a drug for the virus first we have to
see the indispensable processes of the virus, which help them to survive and
replicates its copy number. The genome of the virus showed a sequence similarity of
96.3% BatCoV RaTG13 and 79% with the SARS-CoV[9, 10]. SARS-CoV-2 is an
enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome containing viruses. The RNA
consists of 29,891 nucleotides, which transcribed for 6-12 ORFs, can be translated
into around 28 identified non-structural and structural proteins (NCBI Reference
Sequence: NC_045512.2)[11].
SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host cells containing ACE2, such as lung, oral, and
nasal mucosa by glycosylated spike protein[12]. Human ACE2 interacts with SARSCoV-2 spike proteins and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells[13]. The

viral glycosylated spike protein composed of S1 and S2 subunits in the coronaviruses
which enables them access into the host cell. The RBD of S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2
attaches to ACE2, led to the shed of S1 subunit and subsequently triggers the
cleavage of the S2 subunit by host protease protein, TMPRSS2, that can cleave S1/S2
protease cleavage site[13]. The cleavage changes the conformation and allowing HR1,
HR2 to form 6-HB, which facilitates membrane fusion and virus releases its payload
RNA into the cytoplasm. The first translation product of the RNA genome is
polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab. Subsequently, 3CL protease (3CLpro) and papain-like
protease (PLpro) cleave pp1a and pp1ab to functional proteins required for genome
amplification. The other structural proteins are produced and the host ER-Golgi
system assembles and releases mature virus from infected cells[14, 15]. The current
understanding strongly recommends targeting the surface protein of the viral particle,
which possibly prevents them from entering the host cell.
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a trimeric protein. The RBD of each subunit has
two types of conformations. One conformation is “up” and the other is “down”.
When the conformation is “up”, the viral spike protein could smoothly interact with
human ACE2 protein, otherwise, it is inaccessible[16]. Comparing the structure of
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in spike protein, they have similar amino acid
sequences and functions[17]. However, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the
down conformation N packs tightly against the N terminal domain (NTD) of the
neighboring protomer, whereas the SARS-CoV-2 in the “down” conformation is
angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer. Additionally, the binding affinity
between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 protein is stronger than SARS-CoV,
even 10-20 folds[18]. Therefore, we deduce that the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is
similar to SARS-CoV, but not the same.

Drug discovery and development is a time taking, costly, and complex process.
It usually takes years of effort to get clinically successful[19]. However, the virtual
screening of authentic databases and the use of advanced bioinformatics and
cheminformatics can reduce the time to come up with the best drug match to the
selected target. This process of virtual screening has become a gold standard method
for the preliminary phase of drug designing. To discover the potential hits against
SARS-CoV-2, we have screened the essential entry pathway targeting virus
penetration into cells. This study aims to find the potential hit compounds from
Taiwan Database of Extracts and Compounds (TDEC, https://tdec.kmu.edu.tw/) for
and against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We focus on the screen of hit compounds
that can interact with viral spike protein and spike-ACE2 complex protein, leading to
the prevention of viral payload into the host cytoplasm. We have selected our target
mainly in the RBD of spike proteins for viral and host cell interactions. TDEC is an
academic and scientific platform for investigators in different fields to share their
research information. It includes much information, such as compounds’ structures,
physicochemical properties, and biological activities, etc. on pure natural isolates,
crude extracts, and synthesized extract from plants, microbes, marine organisms, and
Chinese Herbal Medicines. In the present study, an attempt has been made to
virtually screen candidates from TDEC for a selected target and did all the high
throughput bioinformatics and cheminformatics analysis to get an insight into the
interaction of spike protein and hits.

Materials and methods
Protein superimposition
The protein superimposition was performed by PyMOL software (version
0.99rc6) to compare the conformation of spike proteins in two states[20]. One was
spike protein in the prefusion ACE2-free conformation, and the other was RBD of
spike protein in the ACE2-bound conformation. In this study, the simulated structure
of the RBD of spike protein in the prefusion ACE2-free conformation was
constructed by homology modeling using the structure of the experimental structure
of ACE2-free spike protein resolved by cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) as
the modeling template (S1A Fig) and the simulated spike protein was able to be
obtained from SWISS MODEL website (S1B Fig)[18, 21]. The other was RBD of the
spike protein bound with ACE2 protein that was an experimental protein structure
resolved by X-ray crystallography and it was able to be downloaded from Protein
Data Bank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org/) (S1C Fig)[22]. The protein superimposition
calculations were analyzed and shown by PyMOL software.

Structure-based virtual screening
The virtual screenings with molecular docking calculations were performed by
AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2) program within PyRx (version 0.8) software to
discover the potential compounds binding into the viral spike protein from the
compound database [23, 24]. The 2,321 structures of compounds were downloaded
(May 9, 2020) from TDEC, and then collected those compounds together and save it
as an sdf format file by Discovery Studio 2019 visualizer software (DS 2019)[25].
Subsequently, these structures of compounds were optimized by energy minimization
with steepest descent algorithm using MMFF94 force field, and then translated and

divided to 2,321 individual pdbqt format files by Open Babel program within PyRx
software[26]. The experimental structure of spike-ACE2 complex protein resolved by
X-ray crystallography was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6M0J) and the
simulated structure of prefusional spike protein was downloaded from SWISS
MODEL website[21, 22, 27]. After that, the substrates, including ligands, metal ions,
and water molecules existed in both protein structures were all removed and the
atoms of residues in both protein structures were modified by added the polar
hydrogens and partial charges using DS 2019 software with CHARM force field.
Moreover, to discover the potential compounds binding into the RBD of spike protein
in the prefusion conformation and the site of the connective interface of spike-ACE2
complex protein from the database by virtual screening, dimensions of docking
search spaces were respectively set big enough to contain the residues of ACE2
binding site on the RBD of spike proteins. Therefore, the size of the docking sites
was respectively set as follows. In experimental spike-ACE2 complex protein
resolved by X-ray crystallography, the coordinates of docking search space were
respectively set at x = -38.6172, y = 28.4230, and z = 5.0328, and the size of
dimensions of x, y, and z-axis (angstrom) were respectively set as x = 30.2373, y =
57.9713, and z = 19.4614. In other words, the docking space was set to the location
which was at the connective interface of the spike-ACE2 complex protein. Besides, in
the simulated spike protein in the prefusion conformation, the coordinates of docking
search space were respectively set at x = 226.271, y = 195.386, and z = 306.4952, and
the sizes of dimensions of x, y, and z-axis (angstrom) were respectively set as x =
47.2191, y = 38.0448, and z = 30.3288. It meant that the docking space was set to
locate at the site on the prefusion RBD of the spike protein. Furthermore, the values
of exhaustiveness used to search for molecular conformations were all set as 4 in

docking calculation. Finally, the results of the docking simulations were shown and
analyzed by PyMOL and DS 2019 software.

Results
Protein superimposition
A previous report had been shown that once the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein bound to human ACE2 protein, it can assist virus entry into the cells[17].
Recently, the 3D protein structure of the viral spike protein has been resolved by
Cryo-EM technique[18]. However, we found that the structure of the spike protein
resolved by Cryo-EM was incomplete because it lacked parts of residues in the RBD
of spike protein (S1A Fig). Therefore, the structure of the spike protein with the
complete amino acid sequences in the prefusion conformation was needed to be
constructed by simulation. Fortunately, a useful and trusted simulated structure of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the prefusion conformation that has been constructed
by homology modeling and could be easily downloaded from SWISS-MODEL
website (S1B Fig). Additionally, the viral RBD of spike protein bound with human
ACE2 protein, the spike-ACE2 complex protein, was also recently resolved by X-ray
crystallography (S1C Fig). To investigate whether the conformation between the
RBD of spike proteins in ACE2-free state and ACE2-bound state have differences or
not, the protein superimposition was performed by PyMOL software using the
structural aligning method. The data showed that the value of root mean square (RMS)
of the two conformations was 1.735 Å (< 2Å). It meant that the superimposition
between both RBD of spike proteins was good (Fig 1). However, comparing the RBD
regions of both spike proteins in the simulation models, it was significantly different
in structural conformation (blue ring in Fig 1). The simulation showed that the

position of receptor-binding motif (RBM) regional structure in prefusion
conformation was close to the RBD core than in the fusion conformation. Besides,
the pose of RBM regional structure in the fusional conformation was more close to
ACE2 protein than in the prefusion conformation. Generally, SAR-CoV-2 RBM
contains many contacting residues binding to human ACE2 protein[22]. We
concluded that the conformation changing of the RBM regional structure in the spike
protein might affect the spike protein binding behavior to human ACE2 protein.

Fig 1. The protein superimposition of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in two
states. One is the simulated prefusional RBD protein constructed by homology
modeling and the other is the experimental RBD protein of the spike-ACE2 complex
protein resolved by X-ray crystallography. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD cores of the
prefusional RBD structure and fusional RBD structure of the spike-ACE2 complex
protein are respectively shown in cyan and green, and their RBM are respectively
shown in orange and yellow. The ACE2 receptor is also shown in red. The major
difference between the prefusional RBD of spike protein and the RBD of spike-ACE2
complex protein is shown within the blue ring.

Structure-based virtual screening
The study reported that C-terminal domain (CTD) of SARS-CoV spike protein
bound to ACE2 protein with different kinds of angles and its conformations or poses
would be changed to well fit the conformation of dynamic ACE2 protein, such as
ACE2 unbound-up conformation, ACE2-bound conformation, and ACE2 unbounddown conformation[10]. Additionally, we have observed that the conformation of the
RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the prefusional state is different from in the

fusional state (Fig 1). In other words, we can speculate that the conformation of the
dynamic RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would change to well bind and fit
dynamic ACE2 protein. Therefore, we could design a strategy that two potential
hitting sites could be set as the compound docking sites to prevent the spike protein to
bind to ACE2 protein. One was that compounds docked on the RBD of the spike
protein to prevent spike protein to bind to the human ACE2 protein, and the other was
that compounds docked to the site of the connective interface of the spike-ACE2
complex protein to influence the affinity of binding between dynamic viral spike
protein and dynamic human ACE2 protein and to cause nonfunctional changing of
structural conformation to prevent viral spike protein from cleaved by human
proteases. In this study, our aim was going to discover the compounds that not only
can bind to the RBD of spike protein in the prefusion conformation but also bind to
the site of the connective interface of spike-ACE2 complex protein. To discover the
potential compounds, the virtual screening with molecular docking calculation was
performed by AutoDock Vina program within PyRX software. All molecular
structures prepared for virtual screening were downloaded from TDEC website. The
results showed that the numbers of docked compounds (binding energy < -8 kcal/mol)
in the prefusion RBD of spike protein and the spike-ACE2 complex protein were
respectively 53 and 222. Among those compounds, the numbers of overlapped
compounds and non-overlapped compounds were respectively 39 and 197. The
binding energies and properties of 39 overlapped compounds were respectively
shown in Fig 2, S2 Fig, and S1 Table. Subsequently, once the value of the screening
threshold raised and limited to -9 kcal/mol, only compounds TDEC2018CN001781
(Thioflexibilolide A) and TDEC2020CN000246 (Candidine) reached the condition.

thioflexibilolide A also successfully docked with the site near the connective
interface of the RBD of spike-ACE2 complex protein and its value of binding energy
was -8.9 kcal/mol (Fig 5C). Besides, it also formed many interactions with amino
acids in the space near the connective interface of the RBD of spike-ACE2 complex
protein. The results showed that thioflexibilolide A formed three hydrogen-bonding
interactions (green dashed line) with amino acids Lys26, Asp30, and Asn33, and their
interactive distances were respectively 2.11Å, 2.87Å, and 1.81Å and an alkyl-alkyl

was 2.87Å. Moreover, it also formed a pi-alkyl interaction (light purple dashed line)
with amino acid His34, and its interactive distance was 4.71Å (Fig 5D).

The data also showed that candidine could dock with the prefusional RBD of
spike protein (cyan cartoon) and its value of binding energy was -9.0 kcal/mol (Fig

respectively 4.86Å and 4.67Å and four pi-sigma interactions (dark purple dashed line)

kcal/mol (Fig 6C). Besides, it also formed many interactions with amino acids in the
space near the connective interface of the RBD of spike-ACE2 complex protein. The
results showed that it formed an electrostatic hydrogen-bonding interaction (green

it also formed a hydrophobic pi-sigma interaction (dark purple dashed line) with
amino acid Asn33, and its interactive distance was 3.94Å (Fig 6D).

In conclusion, the results revealed that two natural products thioflexibilolide A
and candidine may have the potential abilities to bind to the RBD of spike protein in
the prefusion conformation and spike-ACE2 complex protein and have good binding
affinities than others. In other words, the compounds may have the potential efficacy
to prevent the viral spike protein from binding to human ACE2 protein. Moreover,
some residues located in the two proteins might play key roles in the compound
binding. The simulation showed that both compounds could interact with the same

Discussion
COVID-19 becomes difficult now to manage COVID-19 patients because of the
absence of an effective vaccine as well as drug availability. Hence, there is an
expedite need for new drug development against SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have
been reported many virtually screening drugs targeting proteases, such as 3CL
protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), which processed the essential
polyprotein of infectious coronavirus[17, 28, 29]. The present study aimed to first
screen the hit compounds for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We have aimed the
conformations of target sites from viral surface protein, the prefusional spike protein
and fusional spike-ACE2 complex protein for our virtual screening method to
identify the best possible drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The target sites are vital at the
entry point of viral particles entering into the cell of the host. As the functional spike
protein and its interaction with ACE2 is substantial because it governs virus entry of
the virus into the host cell, this makes it an attractive target in developing drugs and
vaccines for coronaviruses[13, 30]. The predictions obtained from virtual screening
such as binding energy, possible flexibility in conformation, are still very useful to
lead the way of drug discovery or drug repurposing. As represented in Fig 4, we have
started with 2,321 compounds taken from TDEC and applied the filters to get
compound which can bind to the target structures with high affinity. Notably, we got
the two natural products, thioflexibilolide A and candidine, which passed all the
filters applied with the strong binding energy respectively -9.2 kcal/mol and -9.0
kcal/mol on the prefusion spike protein and -9.8 kcal/mol and -8.9 kcal/mol on the
spike-ACE2 complex protein (Fig 5 and Fig 6). The other compounds listed in the S1

Table have reasonable binding energy around -8 kcal/mol, which can be considered
in the further phenotypic assay. Among them, hit compounds were able to influence
the interaction between viral RBD of the spike protein and the human ACE2 protein
in two dynamic proteins. Besides, we also found among these 39 compounds that
Dioscin, Actinomycin D and Saikosaponin C had been reported that they had antivirus activity against others virus (S2 Table). Although, those compounds that we
discovered from the database may have the potential ability to prevent the binding
between viral spike protein and human ACE2 protein, the efficacy of compounds
were still needed to be further verified by bioassay.
Thioflexibilolide A and candidine were natural products respectively isolated
from soft coral Sinularia flexibilis and Phaius mishmensis[31, 32]. In chemical
structure, the structure of candidine is more solid than thioflexibilolide A. It
suggested that candidine could be more specificity than thioflexibilolide A in binding
ability with viral spike protein. Additionally, the docking model also showed that the
binding positions of thioflexibilolide A and candidine were similar whatever in the
prefusional RBD of spike protein or spike-ACE2 complex protein. The results
showed that both compounds could interact with the same residues whatever located
in the prefusional RBD of spike protein or the connective interface of spike-ACE2
complex protein. Furthermore, in the docking models, the results also showed that
both compounds bound to the side face of RBM of the spike protein. We deduced that
it might be caused that the RBM of spike protein is major composed of chain type of
structure rather than α-helix or β-sheet structure (S1 Fig). Besides, we also deduce
that two compounds bind to side face respectively with the RBM of the ACE2-free
spike protein and the connective interface of spike-ACE2 complex protein probably
affect the affinity of binding between viral spike protein and human ACE2 protein or

influence its conformation changing to prevent spike protein to be cleaved by host
protease like TMPRSS2 (Fig 5 and Fig 6).
To rapidly develop useful drugs against SARS-CoV-2, computer-aid drug
screening was performed in many studies. For instance, Chen et al. reported that
drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) may have
the inhibition for viral 3CLpro[13] by virtual screening. Besides, Ma et al. screened
12,322 and 11,294 potential components respectively against viral 3CLpro and PLpro
from TCMD 2009 database in silico[33]. Furthermore, Khana et al. respectively
identified 2 potential compounds for viral 3CLpro and 20-O-ribose methyltransferase
from an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs by virtual screening[28]. Moreover,
Ton et al. found 1,000 potential compounds for viral 3CLpro that may have the
efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 from ZINC15 library by structure-based virtual
screening using Deep Docking[34]. Additionally, Gentile discovered 17 potential
inhibitors against viral 3CLpro from marine natural products by virtual screening
integrating with pharmacophore and molecular dynamic[30]. Besides, Wang
identified drugs Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir, and Elbasvir had
good binding affinities for 3CLpro by virtual screening integrating with docking
calculation and molecular dynamics simulations[35]. Likewise, Pant et al. utilized insilico approaches screened 300 potential compounds against viral 3CLpro from
CHEMBL database, ZINC database, FDA approved drugs database[36]. Liu ex al.
found an anticoagulation agent dipyridamole (DIP) from U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved drug library by virtual screening. The literature also
pointed out that it could suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro[37]. Sarma et al.
identified 2 compounds against viral NTD of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) from

Asinex and Maybridge library by virtual screening integrating with docking,
molecular property, and molecular dynamic[29].
Wu et al. reported for the first time that screening potential compounds for
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from compound databases by virtual screening [38]. They
constructed 20 homology structures including 19 viral targets and 1 human target and
screened many potential compounds from ZINC database, in-house natural products,
and 78 antiviral drugs by virtual screening and fast shared their huge results to
researchers around the world in February of this year. At that time, structures of both
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and spike-ACE2 complex protein yet be resolved and
published. Therefore, based on the reasons, they constructed the simulated RBD of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by homology modeling using SARS-CoV spike
glycoprotein (PDB ID: 3SCI) as the template and built spike-ACE2 complex protein
by protein-protein docking. Recently reported had pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV spike protein were homology proteins with greater than 70% similar
sequences and have the same function for binding ACE2. However, the previous
report also showed that the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
ACE2 was higher than SARS-CoV spike protein approximately 10-20 folds[18, 39].
These reports suggested that it is highly similar but not the same in partial structure or
conformation in the spike proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover,
spike-ACE2 complex protein was constructed by protein-protein docking may not
good enough to directly exhibit the protein-protein binding situation in fact. Recently,
the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the prefusion conformation (PDB ID:
6VSB) and the complex protein that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's RBD bound with
ACE2 protein had already been resolved (PDB ID: 6M0J) respectively by Cryo-EM
and X-ray crystallography with high resolution[18, 22]. Therefore, the two new

resolving protein structures were likely more close to the structural situations in fact.
In other words, it could raise the accuracy in structure-based virtual screening with
docking calculation because of those structures resolved with high resolution that is
why we did that in this study.
Developing the viral spike antibody is one of the good strategies to fight against
SARS-CoV-2. It could bind to the RBD of spike protein to neutralize SARS-CoV-2
had been reported [40, 41]. However, it is concerned about inducing antibodydependent enhancement (ADE)[42]. Herein, we reported that the 39 potential
compounds against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may have the advantage of avoiding
to induce ADE.
ACE2 was a type I transmembrane protein and it functioned as a
carboxypeptidase to mediate homeostasis of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as
blood volume, lung and cardiovascular regulating functions, by cleaving angiotensin
II (Ang II) to Ang(1-7)[43]. ACE2 was higher expressed in the small intestine,
kidneys, testicles, adipose tissue, and thyroid and moderate in the lungs, liver, adrenal
glands, and rectum and lower in the blood, blood vessels, spleen, brain, muscle, and
bone marrow[44, 45]. On the other hand, gender and age characters could affect
ACE2 expression under inflammatory conditions in the skin, lung, brain, and
thyroid[44]. Recent studies also showed that gender could affect SARS-CoV-2
infection susceptibility and virus clearance[17]. Besides, another report also pointed
out that COVID-19 patients' symptoms including dysfunctions in diarrhea, taste, and
smell; injuries in the liver, kidney, and heart may have a close relationship with
ACE2 expression[46]. Herein, our results showed the 39 potential compounds could
prevent the binding between viral spike protein and human ACE2 protein in silico. It

is speculated that those potential compounds could fight against COVID-19 and
lower the expression in the above symptoms for humans.
Natural products proved to be beneficial due to the contribution from a long
time to develop effective drugs for several diseases[47]. Therefore, we have tried our
endemic TDEC which is very rich and diverse in natural product resources derived
from

thioflexibilolide A is well-known for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory
activities derived from soft corals, whereas about gravicycle is reported non-toxic
after its in vitro toxicity assessment in the cell[48]. The results we are reporting here
about the compounds which are screened by employing virtual screening with
molecular docking approach from the database for disabling SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein’s RBD from its interaction with ACE2 receptor of the host cell is very first of
its kind as far as possibly know. The compounds perform well to get the filter into
potential drug candidate during our screening process, and we strongly recommend
our compound for further in vitro and in vivo investigation.

Conclusion
The study carried out intending to come up with potential drugs for COVID-19
therapy. Here in this piece of work, we virtually screened more than 2000 drugs
against the target spike protein’s RBD. After data mining and filtering out the unfitted
compounds, we finally found two compounds named thioflexibilolide A and
candidine. We have done the molecular docking to check whether it binds with the
target with strong affinity or not. As per our result, we found these two compounds
bind with strong affinity to the selected target of the viral protein. We believed that
these two compounds could be potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2. The two

Supporting information
S1 Fig. The structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different conditions. (A)
Spike protein composed of trimers (green, cyan, pink cartoons) in the prefusion
conformation resolved by cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and could be
downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VSB)[18]. (B) Structure of the spike
protein simulated by homology modeling. The homology modeling spike protein
structure using the viral spike protein structure which was resolved by Cryo-EM as
the modeling template and could be obtained from SWISS MODEL website[18, 21].
The quality of simulated spike protein is good ( GMQE score = 0.72 (0 < score < 1),
GMEAN score = -2.81 ( score > -4.0)) that verification was provided by SWISS
MODEL[49, 50] (C) Structure of spike-ACE2 complex protein was resolved by Xray crystallography and obtained from PDB (PDB ID: 6M0J)[22]. The RBD of spike
protein and ACE2 respectively shown in the green and red cartoons. (D) Compared
the RBD of spike proteins in the prefusion conformation between the structure which
was resolved by Cryo-EM (yellow cartoon) and the simulated structure (green
cartoon) by protein superimposes using PyMOL software. The data showed the value
of root mean square (RMS) of the two conformations was 0.713 Å (< 2Å). On the
other hand, the structural superimpose between both proteins was good. The
structures in the region within the blue frame are the range of lacking residues and
would be filled by homology modeling.
S2 Fig. The structures of 39 potential compounds. The 39 compounds (binding
energy < -8) that not only can bind to the RBD of spike protein in the prefusion
conformation but also bind to the site of the connective interface of spike-ACE2
complex protein. The TDEC ID of each structure was also shown in figure.
