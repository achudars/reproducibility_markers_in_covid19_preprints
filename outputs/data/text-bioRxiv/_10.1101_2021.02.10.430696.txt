Abstract
The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an
urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical
development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain displayed on a twocomponent protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb)
responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different
adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an
alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines;
AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in
Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell
responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03
immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination.
AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection
in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with
protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as
the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro. Taken together, these data highlight the efficacy of
the RBD-NP formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants in promoting robust immunity against SARSCoV-2 in non-human primates.

Subunit vaccines are amongst the safest and most widely used vaccines ever developed. They have been
highly effective against a multitude of infectious diseases such as Hepatitis-B, Diphtheria, Pertussis,
Tetanus and Shingles in diverse age groups, from the very young to the very old. An essential component
of subunit vaccines is the adjuvant, an immune-stimulatory agent which enhances the magnitude, quality
and durability of the immune responses induced by vaccination even with lower doses of antigen1.
Therefore, the development of a safe and effective subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would represent
an important step in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The most widely used adjuvant, Aluminium salts
(Alum), has been used in billions of doses of vaccines over the last century. During the past decade, several
novel adjuvants have been developed including the a-tocopherol containing squalene-based oil-in-water
adjuvant AS032, and the toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 ligand CpG 10183,4, which are included in licensed
vaccines against pandemic influenza and Hepatitis-B, respectively. In particular, both AS03 and CpG 1018
are currently being developed as adjuvants for use in candidate subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; however,
their capacity to stimulate protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown.
We recently described SARS-CoV-2 RBD-16GS-I53-50 (RBD-NP), a subunit vaccine in which 60
copies of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are displayed in a highly immunogenic array using a computationally
designed self-assembling protein nanoparticle (hereafter designated RBD-NP)5. Pre-clinical evaluation in
mice showed that the vaccine elicits 10-fold higher nAb titers than the two-proline (2P) prefusion-stabilized
spike (which is used by most vaccines being developed) at a 5-fold lower dose and protects mice against
mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge5. In the current study, we evaluated the capacity of AS03, CpG
1018 formulated in Alum, as well as the squalene-in-water emulsion (O/W), the TLR-7 agonist adsorbed
to Alum (AS37)6 and Alum to promote protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates
(NHPs).

Robust antibody responses to RBD-NP formulated with different adjuvants
To assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of RBD-NP vaccination with different adjuvants, we
immunized 29 male Rhesus macaques (RMs) with 25 µg RBD antigen (71 µg of total RBD-NP
immunogen; Extended Data Fig. 1) formulated with one of the following five adjuvants: O/W, AS03, AS37,
CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum) or Alum (Fig. 1a). Four additional animals were administered with saline as
a control. All the immunizations were administered via intramuscular route on days 0 and 21 in forelimbs.
Four weeks after the booster immunization, we challenged the animals with SARS-CoV-2 via
intratracheal/intranasal (IT/IN) routes. Five of the ten animals immunized with AS03-adjuvanted RBD-NP
were not challenged to allow evaluation of the durability of the vaccine-elicited immune responses and will
be challenged at a distal time point.
Evaluation of binding antibody responses to vaccination showed that S-specific IgG was detected
21 days after primary immunization in all vaccination groups and increased in magnitude after boosting
(Fig. 1b). AS03 induced the highest magnitude of binding IgG (GMT EC50 1:8551) on day 42, and O/W
induced the lowest (GMT EC50 1:1308) response. Binding antibodies in the AS37, CpG-Alum, and Alum
groups were comparable to AS03 in magnitude. In addition to S-specific IgG, we also measured antibody
response to the I53-50 protein nanoparticle (NP) scaffold. Anti-NP antibody titers were elicited in all the
groups albeit at a lower magnitude (1.7-fold lower on average) in comparison to the anti-Spike antibody
titers among the different adjuvant groups at day 42 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The anti-NP antibody response
correlated strongly with S-specific binding antibody responses (Extended Data Fig. 2b).
RBD-NP immunization induced detectable nAb responses against a SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped
7

virus after primary immunization, which significantly increased in all groups after the booster
immunization (Fig. 1c). In particular, the RBD-NP/AS03 immunization induced a geometric mean titer
(GMT) of 1:63 on day 21 (3 weeks after primary immunization) that increased to 1:2,704 (43-fold) on day
42. The other groups, O/W, AS37, CpG-Alum, and Alum induced a GMT of 1:232, 1:640, 1:2,164, and
1:951 on day 42, respectively. These responses were remarkably higher than the nAb titers of 4 convalescent
human samples (GMT 1:76) and the NIBSC control reagent (NIBSC code 20/130, nAb titer 1:241)
(Extended Data Fig. 3a) assayed simultaneously. Next, we measured the nAb responses against the
authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using a recently established Focus Reduction Neutralization Titer (FRNT)
assay8, which has been used to analyze the recent clinical trials of the Moderna mRNA vaccine9,10.
Consistent with the pseudovirus neutralization assays, all adjuvants induced robust live-virus nAb titers
after the secondary immunization (Fig. 1d). The RBD-NP/AS03 group showed the highest nAb titers (GMT
1:4,145) followed by the rest of the adjuvants with no statistical difference except for O/W. Furthermore,
there was a strong correlation between pseudovirus and live-virus nAb titers, as seen in other studies

(Extended Data Fig. 3b)11,12. Lastly, we measured the RBD-NP-specific plasmablast response using
ELISPOT four days after secondary immunization (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The magnitude of antigenspecific IgG-secreting cells in blood correlated with the observed antibody responses (Extended Data Fig.
3d).

RBD-NP/AS03 immunization induces durable live-virus nAb responses
Inducing potent and durable immunity is critical to the success of a vaccine and determines the frequency
with which booster immunizations need to be administered. To determine durability of nAb responses, we
followed five animals immunized with RBD-NP/AS03 without challenge for 5 months. The pseudovirus
nAb titers measured until day 126 declined moderately but did not differ significantly between days 42 and
126 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Strikingly, nAb response measured against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus
using FRNT assay was durably maintained up to day 154 (Fig. 1e). Of note, the FRNT assay was performed
in the same laboratory that measured durability in the Moderna vaccine study10. The GMT titers decreased
by 5-fold between days 42 (GMT 5.638 in the 5 animals that were followed) and 154 (GMT 1,108),
although this was not statistically significant (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, we observed little to no reduction in
the efficiency of ACE-2 blocking by sera collected at these time points (Extended Fig. 4b). These results
demonstrate that the RBD-NP/AS03 immunization induces potent and durable nAb responses13.

Adjuvanted RBD-NP immunization elicits nAb response against the variant B.1.1.7.
Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging recently, causing concerns that vaccine-induced immunity
may suffer from lack of ability to neutralize the variants. One of the variants, B.1.1.7, was first identified
in the United Kingdom and has since been found to be circulating globally. We evaluated if sera from
animals immunized with RBD-NP + AS03, AS37, or CpG-Alum, neutralizes the B.1.1.7 variant. Using a
pseudovirus neutralization assay as well as the live-virus neutralization assay, we determined that
all the three groups induced nAb titers against the variant comparable to that of the wild-type (WT) SARSCoV-2 (Extended Data Fig. 4c and Fig. 1f).

Adjuvanted RBD-NP immunization induces robust CD4 T cell responses
We assessed antigen-specific T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay using a 21parameter flow cytometry panel (Supplementary Table. 2). We first measured RBD-specific T cells after
ex vivo stimulation with a peptide pool (15-mer peptides with 11-mer overlaps) spanning the SARS-CoV-

2 RBD. RBD-NP immunization induced an antigen-specific CD4 T cell response but limited CD8 T cell
response. RBD-specific CD4 responses were highest in the AS03 and CpG-Alum groups (Fig. 2a, b), and
were significantly enhanced after secondary immunization. These responses were dominated by IL-2 or
TNF-a-secreting CD4 T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a), which remained detectable at day 42 (3 weeks postsecondary immunization). The median frequencies of IL-2+ and TNF-a+ CD4 T cell responses in the AS03
group were 0.1% and 0.08%, respectively, on day 28 and reduced to ~0.07% on day 42. There was also a
low but detectable IL-4 response in both the AS03 and CpG-Alum groups that peaked on day 28 but
declined nearly to baseline levels by day 42 (Fig. 2b). Next to AS03 and CpG-Alum groups, Alum also
induced a potent CD4 T cell response. Whereas 75% and 50% of animals in the Alum and O/W groups
showed induction of RBD-specific CD4 T cells, respectively, the TLR-7 agonist AS37 induced a weak T
cell response despite inducing potent antibody response in all the animals.
We assessed the polyfunctional profile of antigen-specific CD4 T cells expressing IL-2, IFN-γ IL4, and TNF-a (Fig. 2c). Although IL-2+, TNF-a+, and IL-2+TNF-a+ double-positive cells formed the
majority (~70%) in all adjuvant groups, differences between the groups were apparent. In particular, AS03
elicited similar proportions of polyfunctional Th1-type and Th2-type CD4 T cells, a balanced Th1/Th2
profile, CpG-Alum showed a slightly higher Th1-type response, and Alum a higher Th2-type response. We
further extended our analyses to measure IL-21 and CD154, markers of circulating TFH-like cells for their
critical role in germinal center formation and generation of durable B cell responses. We observed
detectable IL-21 responses in the AS03 and CpG-Alum groups (Fig. 2d). All cells secreting IL-21 were
CD154+. The IL-21+CD154+ double-positive cells were significantly higher in the AS03 and CpG-Alum
groups in comparison with the AS37 group (Fig. 2e).
We also stimulated PBMCs with a peptide pool spanning the I53-50A and I53-50B nanoparticle
component sequences to determine if RBD-NP immunization induces T cells targeting the nanoparticle
scaffold. We observed a significant proportion of CD4 T cells targeting the I53-50 subunits with a response
pattern, including polyfunctional profiles, similar to that of the RBD-specific T cells (Extended Data Fig.
5b,c). The frequencies of NP-specific CD4 T cells were ~3-fold higher than that of RBD-specific CD4 T
cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d), an observation that is consistent with the RBD making up approximately one
third of the total peptidic mass of the immunogen. In summary, the RBD-NP immunization with adjuvants
induced vaccine-specific CD4 T cells of varying magnitude. While IL-2 and TNF-a were the major
cytokines induced by antigen-specific CD4 T cells, we also observed IL-21 and CD154 responses.

The primary endpoint of the study was protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus, measured as
a reduction in viral load in upper and lower respiratory tracts. To this end, we challenged the animals four
weeks post-secondary immunization with 3.2 x 106 PFU units via intratracheal and intranasal (IT/IN) routes.
Viral replication was measured by subgenomic PCR quantitating the E gene RNA product on the day of
the challenge, as well as 2-, 7- and 14-days post-challenge in nares, pharynges and BAL fluid.
Two days after challenge, 4 out of 4 control animals had detectable subgenomic viral RNA (E gene,
range 3.1x105 – 3.5x108 viral copies) in the pharyngeal and the nasal compartments. By day 7, the viral
RNA quantities reduced to baseline, consistent with previous studies14,15. All adjuvanted groups, except
O/W, afforded protection from infection (Fig. 3a, b). In particular, none of the five animals challenged in
the AS03 group had detectable viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs at any time and only one animal had
detectable viral RNA in nasal swabs, at a level ~1,000-fold lower than the median in control animals
(2.2×104 vs. 2.5×107 viral copies). In contrast, viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal swabs from all four
animals in the SWE group, albeit at lower levels than the control group, and three out of four animals had
detectable viral RNA in nasal swabs. Only one out of five animals in the CpG-Alum group had detectable
viral RNA in pharyngeal or nasal swabs. The AS37 group and, remarkably, the Alum group also showed
undetectable viral RNA in 3 of the 5 animals in both compartments (Fig. 3c).
We measured the subgenomic viral RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid to assess
protection in the lung. We used a more sensitive PCR assay measuring the N gene product16 as we found
only 2 control animals showing a positive viral load in the BAL using E subgenomic RNA. Two days after
the challenge, all 4 of the four control animals showed a viral load in the range of 104 - 106 viral copies. In
contrast, none of the animals in the vaccinated groups except one animal in the O/W group showed any
detectable virus (Fig. 3d), suggesting effective protection in the LRT of all vaccinated groups, including
the O/W group. Overall, the RBD-NP vaccination with adjuvants offered varying degree of protection
against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in upper and lower respiratory tracts.
Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) has previously been described for
respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV17,18. Eosinophilia and enhanced
inflammation in the lung have been shown to be associated with VAERD. We evaluated inflammation in
the lung tissues of a subset of animals using PET-CT on the day of the challenge and 4 – 5 days postchallenge. Of the six animals evaluated (2 from no vaccine, 2 from AS03, and 2 from CpG-Alum groups
selected randomly), we found inflammation in both control animals on day four compared to baseline, as
measured by enhanced 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose (FDG) uptake. In contrast, only one of the four
vaccinated animals showed FDG uptake, to a much lesser extent than the control animals (Fig. 3e and

Extended Data Fig. 6). These data are consistent with an absence of VAERD in these animals and suggest
vaccination may prevent lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Immune correlates of protection
Next, we set out to identify immune correlates of protection. Since we had five different adjuvant groups
showing different protection levels within each group, we analyzed the correlations by combining animals
from all the groups. We correlated humoral and cellular immune responses measured at peak time points
(day 42 for antibody responses and day 28 for T cell responses) with the viral load (nasal or pharyngeal) to
determine the putative correlates of protection in an unbiased approach. Neutralizing, both live and
pseudovirus, titers emerged as the top statistically significant correlates of protection (Fig. 4a, b, and
Extended Data Fig. 7a) in both nasal and pharyngeal compartments. Interestingly, NP-specific IL-2+ TNF+
CD4 T cell response also emerged as a statistically significant correlate of protection in both compartments
(Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7b), the frequencies of which positively correlated with nAb titers
(Extended Data Fig. 7c). This is consistent with the possibility that NP-specific CD4 T cells could offer T
cell help to RBD-specific B cells.

Systems serology profiling reveals functional antibody responses to RBD-NP vaccination
In addition to characterizing nAb and T cell responses to vaccination, we sought to understand the humoral
functional profile elicited by each adjuvant. Vaccines rapidly induced a humoral immune response against
SARS-CoV-2 spike with a profound increase in different anti-spike antibody isotypes (Fig. 5a - c) and FcRbinding (Fig. 5d, e) at day 21 and day 42. To understand how differences in the humoral response may lead
to viral breakthrough, we performed a partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) on the antibody
features measured at day 42, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select
features to prevent overfitting (Fig. 5f). The PLSDA analysis showed separation between animals that had
viral breakthrough in the nasal and pharyngeal and those that showed no viral breakthrough (Fig. 5f),
marked by an enrichment in IgA, FcR3A and antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) against
spike in the protected animals (Fig. 5g).
We determined the correlation of each measured antibody feature and the peak nasal and
pharyngeal viral load to further dissect the antibody features that provide protection against viral breakthrough. Whereas neutralizing Ab response still represents the strongest correlate of protection, we
observed additional functional features including FcR binding (RBD FcR2A-2 and S1 FcR2A-2), and
ADNP that were negatively correlated with nasal or pharyngeal viral loads (Fig. 5h) demonstrating a role

for functional antibody responses in protection. Furthermore, each adjuvant group mounted a distinct
profile of antibody response that correlated with protection against the virus (Extended Data Fig. 8). These
differences between groups highlight that different adjuvants can elicit unique functional antibody
responses to coordinate a protective antiviral response.

Comparison of different Spike-based immunogens with AS03
The data described thus far demonstrate that RBD-NP immunogen when adjuvanted with AS03, AS37,
CpG-Alum and Alum induce robust protective immunity. As a next step, we compared the immunogenicity
of the RBD-NP immunogen to that of HexaPro, a highly stable variant of the prefusion Spike trimer19, in
soluble or in a nanoparticle form. To this end, we designed a second study in which we immunized an
additional 15 male RMs, distributed into three groups, with RBD-NP, soluble HexaPro or 20 Hexapro
trimers displayed on the I53-50 nanoparticle (Hexapro-NP) (Fig. 6a, Supplementary table 3). All three
groups were adjuvanted with AS03, the adjuvant that provided the highest magnitude of nAb responses and
protection in all animals in the upper and lower respiratory tracts in previous experiments. The RBDNP/AS03 immunization induced nAb titers comparable to that of the previous study, with a detectable titer
on day 21 that boosted robustly at day 42. In comparison to the RBD-NP, soluble Hexapro or Hexapro-NP
immunization induced notably higher nAb titers against the matched pseudovirus or authentic virus after
one immunization (Fig. 6b, c). The RBD-NP, however, boosted strongly such that the magnitude of the
nAb titers was not statistically different between the three groups on day 42 (Fig. 6b, c). Furthermore, the
cross-reactive potential of the nAb response against the B.1.1.7 variant elicited by the soluble Hexapro
immunization with AS03 was comparable to that of the WT virus (Fig. 6d), as was the case for RBD-NP
(Fig. 1e). Taken together, these data indicate that the RBD-NP was as potent an immunogen as this highly
stable version of the prefusion Spike trimer, consistent with previous observations that the vast majority of
the neutralizing antibody response elicited by infection or immunization with trimeric Spike targets the
RBD13. Moreover, these data suggest AS03 can be considered as a suitable adjuvant for clinical use with
various forms of the Spike protein.

Discussion
The recent emergency use authorization of two messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
represents a major milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic9,20-23. However, manufacturing
several billion doses of vaccines to vaccinate the entire world’s population will require a portfolio of

different vaccine candidates. In particular, vaccinating special populations such as infants and the elderly
could benefit from the use of subunit adjuvanted vaccine platforms with a demonstrable history of safety
and efficacy in such populations24,25. The primary objective of this study was to select adjuvants for clinical
development of the novel RBD-NP subunit vaccine candidate. We evaluated five different adjuvants,
including two, Alum and AS03, that have been used in several millions of doses of licensed vaccines, for
their capacity to elicit enhanced responses with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP immunogen. All adjuvants
tested induced substantial nAb titers (Fig. 1c, d). Of note, the nAb response to the authentic SARS-CoV-2
virus was induced to quantities equal to or higher than the titers observed in response to mRNA-1273
immunization in humans9 when measured using the same assay (FRNT assay) in the same laboratory. In
general, all adjuvants induced detectable antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses, with AS03 and CpG-Alum
inducing the highest frequencies. A notable finding was the induction of a high magnitude of CD4 T cell
responses specific to the NP-scaffold. It is likely that these NP-scaffold-specific CD4 T cells could provide
T cell help to RBD-specific B cells and promote B cell responses26.
Concomitant with these immune responses, we observed varying levels of protection against IN/IT
challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the various adjuvant groups. Furthermore, we did not observe any
inflammation in the lungs 4 days post-challenge precluding the possibility of VAERD. The varying
responses observed between the different groups allowed us to analyze putative correlates of protection.
Using an unbiased correlation approach, we determined the nAb response as the primary correlate of
protection; however, NP-specific IL-2+/TNF+ responses also showed a correlation. While this correlation is
because of an indirect effect of correlation between T cells and nAb responses as showed in extended fig.
6C, or that the T cell represent an independent correlate of protection by synergizing with nAb response27
needs to be ascertained in future studies. Finally, and importantly, the nAb response induced by RBDNP/AS03 immunization was durable. The nAb responses were measured by focus reduction neutralization
test (FRNT) used in the longevity analysis of the Moderna vaccine candidate10. Although a direct
comparison may not be ideal, the GMT IC50 in the FRNT assay on day 126 and 154 in this NHP study were
1,568 and 1,108, respectively, whereas the GMT IC50 on day 119 in response to mRNA-1273 was 775 in
healthy young adults10. Finally, the adjuvanted RBD-NP immunization also induced cross-neutralization of
the variant B.1.1.7.
In addition to evaluating clinically relevant adjuvants, we also compared the immunogenicity of
RBD and prefusion-stabilized trimeric Spike immunogens. Our results demonstrate that the RBD-NP
immunogen is as potent as immunogens based on the prefusion Spike trimer in inducing nAb titers. Whether
differences in immunogenicity become apparent at lower doses of antigen warrants further investigation.
Nonetheless, these data are encouraging as vaccine candidates in both antigenic formats (i.e., RBD vs.

prefusion-stabilized trimeric Spike), each with distinct manufacturing considerations, move forward to the
clinic. Of particular interest to the field will be to evaluate whether the nAb responses elicited by RBD-NP
or HexaPro-based immunogens induces breadth not only against the new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also
against other coronaviruses.
Overall, the current study represents the most comprehensive comparative immunological
assessment of a set of clinically relevant vaccine adjuvants and antigens in promoting robust and highly
efficacious immune responses against a candidate subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These data reveal the
promising performance of several adjuvants including AS03 and CpG 1018 (with Alum), which have been
used in licensed vaccines, when used in conjunction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-NP immunogen. These
results bode well for the clinical development of RBD-NP and other SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines with
these adjuvants.

Methods
Animal subjects and experimentation.
Thirty-three male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Indian origin, aged 3 - 9 years were assigned to
the study (Supplementary Table 1). Animals were distributed between the groups such that the age and
weight distribution were comparable across the groups. Animals were housed and maintained as per
National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines at the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) of the University
of Louisiana at Lafayette in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Committee on the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animal Resources. The entire study (protocol 2020-8808-15) was reviewed and
approved by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). All animals were negative for SIV, simian T cell leukemia virus and simian retrovirus. For the
challenge, the animals were transferred to the Regional Biosafety Level 3 facility at the Tulane National
Primate Research Center, where the study was reviewed and approved by the Tulane University IACUC
(Protocol 3918).

RBD-16GS-I53-50 nanoparticle immunogen production
Nanoparticle immunogen components and nanoparticles were produced in the same manner as previously
described in detail5, with the exception that the nanoparticle was in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8,
150 mM NaCl, 100 mM L-Arginine, 5% sucrose.

Nanoparticle biochemical characterization
Dynamic light scattering, negative stain electron microscopy, and maACE2-Fc and CR3022 IgG biolayer
interferometry were performed as described previously5.

Adjuvant formulations and immunization
Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion (O/W) was kindly provided by Seppic. The Vaccine
Formulation Institute (VFI) established the formulation of RBD-NP with O/W. For each dose, RBD-NP

was diluted to 50 µg/ml (RBD component) in 250 µl of Phosphate buffered saline with 150 mM NaCl and
mixed with an equal volume of O/W. The dose of O/W was 50% v/v. AS03 and AS37 were kindly provided
by GSK Vaccines. AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion that contains 11.86 mg a-tocopherol, 10.69 mg
squalene, and 4.86 mg polysorbate 80 (Tween-80) in PBS, whereas AS37 is a TLR-7 agonist (200 µg/ml)
adsorbed to Aluminium hydroxide (2 mg/ml). For each dose, RBD-NP was diluted to 50 µg/ml (RBD
component) in 250 µl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and mixed with an equal volume of AS03 or AS37.
The dose of AS03 was 50% v/v (equivalent of one human dose), AS37 included 50 µg TLR-7 agonist and
0.5 mg Aluminium hydroxide. CpG 1018 was generously provided by Dynavax Technologies at a
concentration of 12 mg/ml. Alum (Alhydrogel 2%)

was purchased from Croda Healthcare (Batch

#0001610348). Of note, we used CpG-Alum in contrast to CpG 1018 (no Alum) used in Heplisav-B. For
each dose of CpG-Alum, 25 µg antigen (RBD component) in TBS was mixed with 0.75 mg Alum and
incubated on ice for 30 min. After 30 min of incubation, 1.5 mg of CpG 1018 was added and mixed rapidly.
Each dose contained 1.5 mg CpG 1018 and 0.75 mg Alum. For each dose of Alum, 25 µg antigen (RBD
component) in TBS was mixed with 0.75 mg Alum, matching the concentration of Alum in the CpG-Alum
formulation, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Soluble Hexapro or Hexapro-NP used in study 1B was diluted
to 50 µg/ml in 250 µl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and mixed with an equal volume of AS03. All
immunizations were administered via the intramuscular route in right forelimbs. The volume of each dose
was 0.5 ml.

Anti-S binding ELISA
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was produced in HEK293T cells (Atum, Newark, CA). 96-well Corning

Costar high binding plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with SARS-CoV-2 Sike protein
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 0.2 µg per well overnight at 4°C. On the
next day, wells were washed 3x with PBS - 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with PBS-T
containing 3% non-fat milk powder for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Wells were then
incubated with plasma samples from NHPs at different dilutions starting at 1:100 in PBS-T
containing 1% non-fat milk for 1 hour at 37°C. After washing 3x with PBS-T, horseradish
peroxidase conjugated goat anti-monkey IgG (g-chain specific, Alpha Diagnostics, 1:4’000
dilution), or IgA (a-chain specific, Alpha Diagnostics, 1:4’000 dilution) in PBS-T containing 1%
non-fat milk was added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Wells were washed 3x with PBS-T before

addition of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution. The reaction was stopped
after 12 minutes by addition of 0.16 M sulfuric or 1 M hydrochloric acid. The optical density (OD)
at 450 nanometers was measured with a Tecan Infinite M Nano Plus microplate reader.

Anti-I53-50 ELISA
The protocol was adapted from Tiller, et al.200828. Briefly, recombinant I53-50 protein nanoparticles,
SARS-CoV-2 S2P trimers, or goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #109-005-044) were
immobilized on 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp (Thermo Fisher Scientific) plates (2 μg/mL, 50 μL/well). After 1
h incubation at room temperature, plates were blocked with 200 μL TBS plus 2% (w/v) BSA and 0.05%
(v/v) Tween20 for 1 h. Plates were washed 3x in TBST by plate washer (BioTek), and 50 μL of 1:5 serial
dilutions starting at 1:100 of NHP sera in TBST incubated for 1 h in wells with I53-50 or spike. In wells
with anti-human IgG capture antibody, human IgG control (SinoBiological, #HG1K) was serially diluted
from 0.5-500 ng/mL in TBST in triplicate and 50 μL of each dilution incubated for 1 h. Plates were washed
3x in TBST, then HRP-conjugated goat anti-monkey IgG (Alpha Diagnostics, 70021) was diluted 1:5,000
in 2% BSA in TBST and 50 μL incubated in each well for 30 min. Plates were washed 3x in TBST and 100
μL of TMB (SeraCare) was added to each well for 2 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 100 μL of
1 N HCl. Plates were immediately read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices)
and data plotted and fit in Prism (GraphPad) using nonlinear regression sigmoidal, 4PL, X is
log(concentration) to determine EC50 values from curve fits. A logarithmic equation fit to the linear portion
of the sigmoidal curve of the human IgG control was used to calculate mg/mL of IgG in sera for anti-I5350 and anti-Spike titers. All steps were performed at ambient temperature.

Pseudovirus production and neutralization assay
Pseudovirus production has been described in Walls et al.20207. Briefly, MLV-based SARS-CoV-2 Spike
pseudotyped viruses were prepared as previously7,29,30 except that the SARS-CoV-2 S construct contained
the D614G mutation and a truncation of the C-terminal 21 residues12,31.
For neutralization assays, HEK-hACE2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Hyclone)
and 1% PenStrep with 8% CO2 in a 37°C incubator on poly-lysine (sigma) 96 well plates. To coat plates,
40 μL of poly-lysine (Sigma) was incubated with rotation for 5 min. Poly-lysine was removed, plates were

dried for 5 min then washed once with water prior to plating cells. The following day, cells were checked
to be at 80% confluence. In a half-area 96-well plate a 1:3 serial dilution of sera was made in DMEM in 22
μL final volume. 22 μL of pseudovirus was then added to the serial dilution and incubated at room
temperature for 30 - 60 min at room temperature. HEK-hACE2 plate media was removed and 40 μL of the
sera/virus mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 8% CO2. Following incubation,
40 μL 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep containing DMEM was added to the cells. Following 48 - 72h infection,
One-Glo-EX (Promega) was added to the cells in half culturing volume (40 μL added) and incubated in the
dark for 5 min prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Measurements
were done on all sera samples from each group in at least duplicates. Relative luciferase units were plotted
and normalized in Prism (GraphPad) using a zero value of cells alone and a 100% value of 1:2 virus alone.
Nonlinear regression of log(inhibitor) vs. normalized response was used to determine IC50 values from
curve fits.

Focus Reduction Neutralization Titer assay
Neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed as previously described32.
Plasma/serum were serially diluted (three-fold) in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) in duplicate wells and incubated with 100–200 FFU infectious clone derived SARS-CoV-2-mNG
virus33 at 37 °C for 1 h. The antibody-virus mixture was added to VeroE6 cell (C1008, ATCC, #CRL-1586)
monolayers seeded in 96-well blackout plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Post-incubation, the inoculum
was removed and replaced with pre-warmed complete DMEM containing 0.85% methylcellulose. Plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h, methylcellulose overlay was removed, cells were washed twice
with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following fixation,
plates were washed twice with PBS and foci were visualized on a fluorescence ELISPOT reader (CTL
ImmunoSpot S6 Universal Analyzer) and enumerated using Viridot34. The neutralization titers were
calculated as follows: 1 - (ratio of the mean number of foci in the presence of sera and foci at the highest
dilution of respective sera sample). Each specimen was tested in two independent assays performed at
different times. The FRNT-mNG50 titers were interpolated using a 4-parameter nonlinear regression in
GraphPad Prism 8.4.3. Samples with an FRNT-mNG50 value that was below the limit of detection were
plotted at 10. For these samples, this value was used in fold reduction calculations.

ACE-2 blocking assay

Antibodies blocking the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD to the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) were detected with a V-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 Panel 2 (ACE2) Kit (Meso Scale
Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum samples from NHPs were
analyzed in duplicate at a dilution of 1:100 and percent inhibition was calculated based on the
equation ((1 – Average Sample ECL Signal / Average ECL signal of Calibrator 7) x 100).

Pseudovirus neutralization assay against UK B.1.1.7
Neutralization assay evaluating the ability of sera from vaccinated animals to neutralize wildtype (with
D614G in spike) versus the B.1.1.7 variant viruses were performed using a pseudotyped virus neutralization
assay previously reported with minor modifications35. Briefly, mutations were introduced into a plasmid
expressing codon-optimized Spike of the Wuhan-1 strain that contains the D614G mutation using sitedirected mutagenesis. Pseudovirions were produced in HEK293T/17 cells by co-transfection of a lentivirus
backbone plasmid, a Spike-expressing plasmid, and a firefly Luc reporter gene plasmid. Pseudotyped
viruses were titrated in 293T/ACE2.MF cells for TCID50 and used for neutralization assay. Virus were
incubated with serial diluted serum samples at 37oC for 1 hr, and subsequent added to cells and incubated
for 66-72 hrs. Luminescence was measured using a GloMax Navigator luminometer (Promega).
Neutralization titers are the inhibitory dilution (ID) of serum samples at which RLUs were reduced by either
50% (ID50) or 80% (ID80) compared to virus control wells after subtraction of background RLUs.

Intracellular cytokine staining assay
Antigen-specific T cell responses were measured using the ICS assay. Live frozen PBMCs were revived,
counted and resuspended at a density of 1 million live cells/ml in complete RPMI (RPMI supplemented
with 10% FBS and antibiotics). The cells were rested overnight at 37°C in CO2 incubator. Next morning,
the cells were counted again, resuspended at a density of 15 million/ml in complete RPMI and 100 µl of
cell suspension containing 1.5 million cells was added to each well of a 96-well round-bottomed tissue
culture plate. Each sample was treated with three conditions, no stimulation, a peptide pool spanning the
RBD region of spike at a concentration of 1.2 µg/ml of each peptide and a peptide pool spanning the I5350A, and I53-50B components of the NP-scaffold (1.2 µg/ml of each peptide) in the presence of 1 µg/ml

of anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, BD Biosciences) and anti-CD49d (clone 9F10, BD Biosciences) as well as
anti-CXCR3 and anti-CXCR5 (clone and concentration details in supplementary table 2). The peptides
were custom synthesized to 90% purity using GenScript, a commercial vendor. All samples contained
0.5% v/v DMSO in total volume of 200 µl per well. The samples were incubated at 37°C in CO2 incubators
for 2 h before addition of 10 µg/ml Brefeldin-A. The cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. The cells
were washed with PBS and stained with Zombie UV fixable viability dye (Biolegend). The cells were
washed with PBS containing 5% FCS, before the addition of surface antibody cocktail (Supplementary
table 1). The cells were stained for 20 min at 4°C in 100 µl volume. Subsequently, the cells were washed,
fixed and permeabilized with cytofix/cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) for 20 minutes. The permeabilized
cells were stained with ICS antibodies for 20 min at room temperature in 1X-perm/wash buffer (BD
Biosciences). Cells were then washed twice with perm/wash buffer and once with staining buffer before
analysis using BD Symphony Flow Cytometer. All flow cytometry data were analyzed using Flowjo
software v10 (TreeStar Inc.).

Viral challenge
Animals were inoculated via the intratracheal (IT) and intranasal (IN) routes with a total of 3.2 x 106 PFU
of SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA WA1/2020 (Accession: MN985325). The virus stock was generated by
expansion of a seed stock on Vero E6 cells and titered by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. It was deep
sequenced and found to contain no polymorphisms at greater than 5% of reads relative to the original patient
isolate. The furin cleavage site, a site with frequent culture adaptation in Vero E6 cells, harbored no
polymorphisms at greater than 1% of sequence reads in this stock.

Sampling of nares and pharynges
The animals were anesthetized and placed in dorsal recumbency or a chair designed to maintain its upright
posture. The pharynx was visualized using a laryngoscope. A sterile swab was gently rubbed/rolled across
the lateral surfaces of the pharynx for approximately five seconds. The tonsillar fossa and posterior pharynx
were included. Care was taken to avoid touching the soft palate, uvula, buccal mucosa, tongue, or lips.
After all pertinent surfaces have been sampled, the swab is removed and placed into either culture medium

or an appropriate container for transport. The pharyngeal swabs were done prior to the nasal swabs to reduce
blood contamination from the nasal cavity down into the pharyngeal area.
Sterile swabs were gently inserted into the nares. Once inserted, the sponge/swab was rotated
several times within the cavity/region and immediately withdrawn.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) collection and processing
The animals were anesthetized using Telazol and placed in a chair designed specifically for the proper
positioning for BAL procedures. A local anesthetic (2% lidocaine) may be applied to the larynx at the
discretion of the veterinarian. A laryngoscope is used to visualize the epiglottis and larynx. A feeding tube
is carefully introduced into the trachea after which the stylet is removed. The tube is advanced further into
the trachea until slight resistance is encountered. The tube is slightly retracted and the syringe is attached.
Aliquots of warmed normal saline are instilled into the bronchus. The saline is aspirated between each
lavage before a new aliquot is instilled. When the procedure is complete, the animal is placed in right
lateral recumbency. The animal is carefully monitored with observation of the heart rate, respiratory rate
and effort, and mucous membrane color. An oxygen facemask may be used following the procedure at the
discretion of the veterinarian. The animal is returned to its cage, positioned on the cage floor in right lateral
recumbency and is monitored closely until recovery is complete.
The BAL samples were filtered twice via 100 µ strainers and collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes.
The samples were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred into new tubes,
aliquoted and stored at -80°C until RNA isolation. The cells were washed, lysed for red-blood cells using
ACK-lysis buffer and live-frozen in 90% FBS + 10% DMSO.

Viral load
Quantitative RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase - quantitative PCR) was performed as we described
previously36. RT-qPCR for the subgenomic (sg) RNA encoding the Envelope (E) protein was performed as
described37 and for the sgRNA encoding the Nucleocapsid (N) protein was performed using the same
cycling conditions as used for the sg-E-RT-qPCR using an unpublished assay kindly provided by Drs.
Dennis Hartigan-O’Connor and Joseph Dutra (U. California-Davis). Primers and probes for the sg N qRT44

PET-CT administration, acquisition and data collection
The animals were anesthetized and brought to the PET-CT suite where they were monitored and prepared
for imaging. An intravenous (IV) catheter is placed and the animals were intubated and placed on a gas
anesthetic (isoflurane). 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose (FDG) was administered as an IV bolus at a dose
of 0.5 mCi/kg in the animal preparatory room. The catheter was flushed, and the animals were transferred
to the PET/CT imaging room. Images were acquired on a Mediso LFER 150 PET/CT (Mediso Medical
Imaging Systems, Budapest, Hungary). The animals were then placed on the table in a ‘head-in-supine’
position with heat support. Scout CT images of side and top views were obtained for positioning purposes
and preferred scanning ranges. The number of fields of view (FOV) was determined depending on the size
of the animal (each FOV covers 15 cm and takes 10 minutes to obtain with PET). A CT scan was captured
at 80 kVp and 1 mA with a time range of 1-5 minutes depending on the FOV. Breath holds were performed
during the CT scan on animals that can be imaged in one FOV. A breath-hold lasts for the majority of the
CT scan which is approximately 45-60 seconds. PET images were obtained following FDG uptake time
(45-60 minutes) and the CT scan. Once the images were captured, the animal’s fluids were discontinued
and the animal was removed from isoflurane. When swallowing reflexes return, the animal was extubated
and returned to its home cage. Images were reconstructed using Nucline software with the following
parameters: Mediso Tera-Tomo 3D algorithm, 8 iterations, 9 subsets, voxel size 0.7 mm.

PET-CT data analysis
PET-CT images were analyzed using OsiriX MD or 64-bit (v.11, Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). Before
analysis, the PET images were Gaussian smoothed in OsiriX and smoothing was applied to raw data with
a 3 x 3 matrix size and a matrix normalization value of 24. Whole lung FDG uptake was measured by first
creating a whole lung region-of-interest (ROI) on the lung in the CT scan by creating a 3D growing region

highlighting every voxel in the lungs between -1024 and -500 Hounsfield units. This whole lung ROI is
copied and pasted to the PET scan and gaps within the ROI are filled in using a closing ROI brush tool with
a structuring element radius of 4. All voxels within the lung ROI with a standard uptake value (SUV) below
1.5 are set to zero and the SUVs of the remaining voxels are summed for a total lung FDG uptake (total
inflammation) value. Total FDG uptake values were normalized to back muscle FDG uptake that was
measured by drawing cylinder ROIs on the back muscles adjacent to the spine at the same axial level as the
carina (SUVCMR; cylinder-muscle-ratio)38. PET quantification values were organized in Microsoft Excel.
3D images were created using the 3D volume rendering tool on OsiriX MD.

Luminex Isotype and FcR Binding Assay
To determine relative concentrations of antigen-specific antibody isotypes and Fc receptor binding activity,
a Luminex isotype assay was performed as previously described39. Antigens (SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD,
S1, S2, HKU1 RBD, and OC43 RBD) were covalently coupled to Luminex microplex carboxylated bead
regions (Luminex Corporation) using NHS-ester linkages with Sulfo-NHS and EDC (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to manufacturer recommendations. Immune complexes were formed by incubating
antigen-coupled beads with diluted samples. Mouse-anti-rhesus antibody detectors were then added for
each antibody isotype (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, NIH Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource supported
by AI126683 and OD010976). Tertiary anti-mouse-IgG detector antibodies conjugated to PE were then
added. FcR binding was quantified similarly by using recombinant NHP FcRs (FcγR2A-1, FcγR2A-2,
FcγR3A, courtesy of Duke Protein Production Facility) conjugated to PE as secondary detectors. Flow
cytometry was performed using an iQue (Intellicyt) and an S-LAB robot (PAA), and analysis was
performed on IntelliCyt ForeCyt (v 8.1).

Systems serology
To quantify antibody functionality of plasma samples, bead-based assays were used to measure antibodydependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) and
antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD), as previously described40-43. SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (Hexapro antigen from Erica Ollmann Saphire, La Jallo for Immunology) was coupled to
fluorescent streptavidin beads (Thermo Fisher) and incubated with sera samples to allow antibody binding
to occur. For ADCP, cultured human monocytes (THP-1 cell line) were incubated with immune complexes,

during which phagocytosis occurred. For ADNP, primary PMBCs were isolated from whole blood using
an ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer. After phagocytosis of immune complexes,
neutrophils were stained with an anti-CD66b Pacific Blue detection antibody (Biolegend) prior to flow
cytometry. For ADCD, lyophilized guinea pig complement (Cedarlane) was reconstituted according to
manufacturer’s instructions and diluted in a gelatin veronal buffer with calcium and magnesium (Boston
BioProducts). After antibody-dependent complement deposition occurred, C3 bound to immune complexes
was detected with FITC-Conjugated Goat IgG Fraction to Guinea Pig Complement C3 (MP Biomedicals).
For quantification of antibody-dependent NK cell activation, diluted plasma samples were incubated in
Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with antigen. Human NK cells were isolated the
evening before using RosetteSep Human NK cell Enrichment cocktail (STEMCELL Technologies) from
healthy buffy coat donors and incubated overnight with human recombinant Interleukin 15 (STEMCELL
Technologies). NK cells were incubated with immune complexes, CD107a PE-Cy5 (BD), Golgi stop (BD)
and Brefeldin A (BFA, Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation, cells were stained using anti-CD16 APC-Cy7
(BD), anti-CD56 PE-Cy7 (BD) and anti-CD3 Pacific Blue (BD), and then fixed (Perm A, Life Tech).
Intracellular staining using anti-IFN-γ FITC (BD) and anti-MIP-1β PE (BD) was performed after
permeabilizing the NK cells with Perm B (Thermo Fisher). Flow cytometry acquisition of all assays was
performed using an iQue (IntelliCyt) and a S-LAB robot (PAA). For ADCP, phagocytosis events were
gated on bead-positive cells. For ADNP, neutrophils were identified by gating on CD66b+ cells,
phagocytosis was identified by gating on bead-positive cells. A phagocytosis score for ADCP and ADNP
was calculated as (percentage of bead-positive cells) x (MFI of bead-positive cells) divided by 10,000.
ADCD quantification was reported as MFI of FITC-anti-C3. For antibody-dependent NK activation, NK
cells were identified by gating on CD3-, CD16+ and CD56+ cells. Data were reported as the percentage of
cells positive for CD107a, IFN-γ, and MIP-1β.

Statistics
The difference between any two groups at a time point was measured using a two-tailed nonparametric
Mann–Whitney unpaired rank-sum test. The difference between time points within a group was measured
using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. All correlations were Spearman’s correlations based on
ranks. All the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v.9.0.0 or R version 3.6.1.
