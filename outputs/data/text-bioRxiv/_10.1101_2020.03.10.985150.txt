Abstract

12

Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel

13

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world. Soon after

14

the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC

15

Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer

16

set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies

17

98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome.

18

The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical

19

samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, when sample’s viral load was

20

low, several amplicons, especially amplicons 18 and 76,

21

complete dropout. We have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation

22

between the forward primer for amplicon 18, 18_LEFT, and the reverse primer for amplicon

23

76, 76_RIGHT. Replacement of 76_RIGHT with an alternatively designed primer was

24

sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons. Based on this

25

result, we replaced 12 primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be

26

involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits

27

improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Network’s original (V1) and modified (V3)

28

primer set.

Background

32

The realtime surveillance of pathogen genome sequences during an outbreak enables

33

monitoring of numerous epidemical factors such as pathogen adaptation and transmission

34

chains in local to even global scale (Gardy and Loman 2017, Hadfield et al. 2018). Since it

35

was first identified in Hubei, China in December 2019 (Zhu et al. 2020), the novel coronavirus,

36

SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the atypical respiratory illness COVID-19, has become a major

37

concern for the medical community around the world. The relatively large genome size of

38

corona viruses (approx. 30 kb) and varying levels of viral load in clinical specimens have

39

made it challenging to reconstruct the entire viral genome in a simple and cost-effective

40

manner. In January 2020, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network

41

(https://artic.network/), designed 196 primer (98 pairs) (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-

42

ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V1) for targeted amplification of the

43

SARS-CoV-2 genome by multiplexing PCR. These primers and method were based on a

44

primer design tool Primal Scheme and a laboratory protocol PrimalSeq that had been

45

previously developed for sequencing outbreaking RNA virus genomes directly from clinical

46

samples using portable nanopore sequencer or other NGS platforms (Quick et al. 2017,

47

Grubaugh et al. 2019). The ARTIC primer set for SARS-coV-2 (hereafter, ARTIC primer set

48

V1) is designed to tile amplicons across nearly entire sequence of the published reference

49

SARS-CoV-2 genome MN908947.3 (Wu et al. 2020). The 98 primer pairs are divided into

50

two separate subsets (Pools 1 and 2), such that no overlap between PCR fragments occurs

51

in the same reaction.

52

The ARTIC primer set V1 and the published protocol (Quick 2020) worked quite for

53

samples with a relatively high viral load (Ct < 25 in clinical qPCR tests). For these samples,

54

all designated amplicons are amplified with an acceptable level of coverage bias for

55

subsequent NGS analysis. However, a gradual increase in the overall coverage bias was

56

observed as a sample’sviral load decreased. Although this phenomenon is generally

57

expected in such highly multiplexed PCR, the coverage for the two particular PCR amplicons,

58

18 and 76, which correspond to regions of genome encoding nsp3 in ORF1a and the spike

59

(S) protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other targets (Fig 1A). In our

60

experience, the low to zero depth for those two amplicons was the most frequent bottleneck

61

for using the ARTIC primer set V1 to sequence all targeted genomic regions from samples

62

with middle to low viral load (Ct > 27). In situation with a high coverage bias in genome

63

sequencing such as seen in Fig 1A, excessive sequencing efforts are required to obtain viral

64

genome sequences with no or few gaps. Thus, minimizing the overall coverage bias will

65

benefit the research community by both enabling more multiplexing in given sequencing

66

capacity and lowering the sequencing cost per sample.

67

In this report, we first show that the acute dropout of amplicons 18 and 76 was due to the

68

formation of a single dimer between the forward primer for amplicon 18 and the reverse

69

primer for amplicon 76. The replacement of one of the two interacting primers resolved the

70

dropout of both amplicons. We further detected an additional 13 other potential primer

71

interactions that may be responsible for low coverage in other regions covered by the affected

72

amplicons. Our modified primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), which includes 12 primer

73

replacements from the ARTIC primer set V1, yielded improved overall genome coverage in

74

clinical samples compared to V1 and another modified primer set, V3. The results indicated

75

that preventing primer dimer-formation is an effective measure to improve coverage bias in

76

the ARTIC Network’s SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing protocol, and may be applicable to

77

other PrimalSeq methods in general.

Results and Discussion

80

In the original ARTIC prime set V1, PCR amplicons 18 and 76 were amplified by the primer

81

pairs 18_LEFT & 18_RIGHT and 76_LEFT & 76_RIGHT, respectively. Those primers were

82

included in the same multiplexed reaction, “Pool 2.” We noticed that two of those primers,

83

18_LEFT and 76_RIGHT, were perfectly complementary to one another by 10-nt at their 3′

84

ends (Fig 1). Indeed, we observed NGS reads derived from the predicted dimer in raw

85

FASTQ data. From this observation, we reasoned that the acute dropouts of those amplicons

86

were due to an interaction between 18_LEFT and 76_RIGHT, which could compete for

87

amplification of the designated targets. Next, we replaced one of the two interacting primers,

88

76_RIGHT, in the Pool 2 reaction with a newly designed primer 76_RIGHTv2 (5′-

89

TCTCTGCCAAATTGTTGGAAAGGCA-3′), which is located 48-nt downstream from

90

76_RIGHT. Figures 1A and 1B show the coverage obtained with the V1 set and the V1 set

91

with 76_RIGHT replaced with 76_RIGHTv2 for cDNA isolated from a clinical sample obtained

92

during

93

(EPI_ISL_416596) (Sekizuka et al. 2020). The replacement of the primer drastically improved

94

the read depth in the regions covered by amplicons 18 and 76 without any notable adverse

95

effects. The replacement of the primer 76_RIGTH improved coverage not only for amplicon

96

76, but also for 18 as well, supporting the hypothesis that the single primer interaction caused

97

dropout of both amplicons.

Given this observation, we identified an additional 13 primer interactions using in silico

100

analysis (Fig 2A and B). Those primer interactions predicted by PrimerROC algorithm

101

(Johnston et al. 2019), which gave the highest score for the interaction between 18_LEFT

102

and 76_RIGHT among all 4,743 possible interactions, were likely involved in producing the

103

low coverage frequently seen in our routine experiments. Next, we designed an additional 11

104

alternative primers, which resulted in a new primer set (ARTIC primer set ver. NIID-1 (N1)

105

including 12 primer replacements from the original V1 primer set (Table S1). The N1 primer

106

set eliminated all interactions shown in Fig 2A, and was expected to improve amplification of

107

up to 22 amplicons (1, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 21, 29, 31, 32, 36, 38, 45, 48, 54, 59, 66, 70, 73, 76,

108

85, and 89). Alongside with this modification, the ARTIC Network itself released another

109

modified version of primer set known as V3 in 24th March 2020 (Loman and Quick 2020) after

we reported our result on the replacement of primer 76_RIGHT in a preprint(Itokawa et al.

111

2020a). The V3 primer set included 22 spike-in primers, which were directly added into the

112

V1 primer set to aid amplification of 11 amplicons (7, 9, 14, 15, 18, 21, 44, 45, 46, 76, and

119

temperature experiment would enable us to examine the dynamics of amplification

121

suffering from primer interactions were expected to drop rapidly as

125

With the V1 primer set, amplicons 18 and 76 exhibited extremely low coverage for all

values, with only a slight improvement above 67 °C. In addition to those two amplicons, many

127

other amplicons exhibited reduced coverage in thee lower

Conclusions

150

The formation of primer-dimers is a major cause of coverage bias in the ARTIC Network’s

151

multiplex PCR protocol for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. Eliminating these problematic

152

primer interactions improves sequence coverage and will likely increase the quality of

153

genome sequencing.

191

The purified PCR product was subjected to illumina library prep using QIAseq FX library

kit (Qiagen) in 1/4 scale and using 6 min fragmentation time (Itokawa et al. 2020b). After the

193

ligation of barcoded adaptor, libraries were heated to 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate the ligase,

194

and then all libraries were pooled in a 1.5 ml tube. The pooled library was first purified by

195

AmpureXP at 0.8X concentration, and then again at 1.2X concentration. The purified library

196

was sequenced for 151 cycles at both paired-ends in Illumina iSeq100.

Coverage and depth analysis

198

The obtained reads were mapped to the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 MN908947.3

199

(Wu et al. 2020) using bw mem (Li and Durbin 2009). The epth function in s mtools (Li et

200

al. 2009) with ‘aa’ option was used to determine coverage at each base position. Then, the

201

‘s’ option of s mtools iew function was used for subsampling reads from each mapping data

202

for normalization.

203

The coverage (fragment abundance) analysis was conducted by defining 98

204

representative small regions (10-nt) that are unique to the 98 amplicons amplified by either

205

the V1 or N1 primer set (Supportive file; amplicon_representative_regions.bed). Those

206

representative small regions also reside within overlapped regions where original and

207

corresponding alternative primers in the V3 primer set amplify (e.g. one region overlap with

start and end mapping positions of whole insert sequences of paired-end reads were

210

determined by the b mtobe function in bedtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010) with ‘bedpe’ option.

211

The number of insert fragments overlapping each defined small representative region were

212

counted by the co er ge function in the bedtools. Fragment inserts of unexpectedly long

213

length (>500 bp from start to end positions) were filtered out from the analysis. The depth

214
