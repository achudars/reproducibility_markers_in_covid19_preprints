Summary
RNA testing using RT-PCR can provide direct evidence for
diagnoses of COVID-19 which has brought unexpected disasters and
changes to our human society. However, the absorption of cotton swab
for RNA lysates may lead to a low concentration of detectable RNA,
which might be one of the main reasons for the unstable positive
detecting rate. We designed and manufactured a kind of silicone swab
with concave-convex structure, and further compared the effects of
silicone and cotton swab on RNA extraction. Principal component
analysis and Paired Wilcoxcon test suggested that a higher RNA
concentration and A260/A280 would be obtained using silicone swab.
The results indicated that our silicone swab had a more excellent ability
to sample than the cotton swab, characterized by the higher quantity and
quality of extracted RNA. Thus, we advised that the current cotton swabs
need to be improved urgently in COVID-19 diagnoses and the process of
“sample collection” and “sample pre-processing” must be standardized
and emphasized.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the number one
public enemy in the world now, bringing unexpected disasters and
changes to our human society. Viral RNA testing using RT-PCR was
recommended to provide direct evidence in diagnoses of COVID-19 [1].
However, the positive rate is frustrating (about 30%-60%), combined
with a high false negative rate [2, 3], which create huge obstacles for the
control and prevention of COVID-19. During the screening and detection
for suspected cases, confirmed cases and close contacts, the preferred
sequence of sample collection is nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal
swab and sputum [4]. Flocked swab is the standard material collecting
samples for the first two [5]. The flocked swab stays in nasopharyngeal or
oropharyngeal for 15-30 seconds, rotates gently 3-5 times, lyses and then
extracts RNA [4]. However, importantly, the absorption of flocked swab
for RNA lysates may lead to a low concentration of detectable RNA,
which might be one of the main reasons for the low positive detecting
rate. In addition, prolonged irritating with a throat swab causes subjects
vomiting or coughing in practice, which would increase the risk of
transmission and infection. However, to our knowledge, no studies have
comparatively quantified the testing defect caused by using flocked swab,
and no optimized product has been designed yet. Therefore, designing a
novel swab owning abilities of both the stronger adhesion and more

efficient releasing for samples might contribute to improving virus
detection rate.

RESULTS and DISCUSSION

In the process of coping with the major public health emergencies,
such as COVID-19, increasing the real positive rate and reducing the
false negative rate is crucial. The nuclear acid detection of pharyngeal
mucous collected by flocked swab is the most convenient and common
method. In order to reduce the false negative rate during clinical testing,
updating novel detection techniques is always attracted the most attention
of researchers, but evaluating the quantity and quality of nuclear acid has
always been neglected. Several defects of flocked swabs had been found
in our clinic application, which might be one of the main reasons for the
high false negative rate. First of all, the flocked swab owns a strong
absorption of mucous, but meanwhile, the soaked cotton wool becomes
fluffy and samples could be deeply adsorbed. Thus, it is difficult to elute
samples into lysis solution. Secondly, the flocked swab needs to be
vibrated using steel beads for collecting viral cells as many as possible in
laboratory, but it is too cumbersome to operate in clinical testing. Thus,
thirdly, the swab needs to be stretched into the oropharynx and wiped

repeatedly to collect more. However, the ligneous stick and the hard
flocking surface of the swab would cause resistance of the subjects due to
pain or discomfort. Hence, the collecting result may be not satisfactory,
which to a certain extent, results in missing detection.
Therefore, we produced a novel swab made of elastic silicone gel,
and subtly designed a concave-convex structure for improving the
adhesion and increasing the adhesion surface (Fig S1). The elastic
silicone gel is obviously softer and more comfortable than the flocked
swab. In addition, the mucus mixture will be collected more efficiently on
the swab surface and also be eluted more easily using our silicone swab
than the cotton swab. Based on the examined indexes, including the
concentration (i.e., quantity) as well as A260/A280 (i.e., quality), of
extracted RNA, PCA showed that the individuals could be extremely well
separated by the silicone and cotton groups (P < 0.001, Fig 1A). In
particular, the PC1 explaining 99.7% of the variations in data showed an
extremely significant difference between the cotton and silicone groups
(P < 0.001, inserted in Fig 1A). Specifically, the concentration of RNA
was significantly higher from the silicone group than the cotton group
based on paired comparison (P < 0.001, Fig 1B), separately accounting
for 9.4 and 6.4 ng/μl for the silicone and cotton group. In addition, the
value of 260/280 which represents the purity of nucleic acids was also
significantly higher in the silicone group (P = 0.01, Fig 1C). These results

indicated that the elastic silicone gel significantly improved sampling
efficiency.
Last but not least, the infection of COVID-19 for medical staff
occurs in all aspects of prevention and treatment. For viral RNA testing,
after sampled, the swab applicator was cut and placed into a tube
containing RNA preservation solution. Then the sealed sample tube was
delivered to the clinical lab for detection. Although RNA preservation
solution can lyse the viral shell and make it inactive, the residuary
flocked swab increased the infection risk of the examiner. This defect
could be avoided by using the elastic silicone swab. The samples
collected by the elastic silicone swab would be almost fully eluted into
the tube, and the swab would be discarded as medical waste. Therefore,
the detectors would not contact with the polluted swabs, minimizing the
infection risk of COVID-19.
Overall, we advise clinicians to pay more attention to the process of
mucus collection, which might significantly improve the early detection
rate of COVID-19. It's worth mentioning that during the critical period
confronting COVID-19 globally, we decided to announce the findings in
time, even though the results were not verified by a big data. Even so, our
data suggested that the current swabs need to be improved urgently. In the
following research, we will optimize the elastic silicone gel and conduct

1 The sample collection and sample pre-processing before the
RNA extraction should be standardized and emphasized so as to eliminate
the false-negative as much as possible.
2 In the process of sample collecting, whether the sampling area is
nasopharyngeal or palatopharyngeal, the following three important
factors should be paid attention: sufficient contact with sampling area; a
certain strength of sampling and a sufficient sampling duration. The swab
which owning excessive interstices like flocking swab should be avoided.
To ensure that more samples are obtained during extraction, the swab
owing higher rates of adhesion and elution is recommended.
3 In the process of sample pre-processing, the swab head should be
adequately pressed on the inner wall of the centrifuge tube and wash
swings repeatedly so that the sample can be fully eluted into the RNA
lysate. Befor using RNA extraction Kit, a step of centrifugation with
13,000rpm at 10min must be stipulated for dealing with all eluant and
collecting the sediment, rather than sucking a portion of the eluent
without centrifugation current widely used. During this process, the

Methods
Sample collection and RNA extraction
We designed and manufactured a kind of silicone swab with
concave-convex structure and compared its effects on RNA extraction
with cotton swab provided by Department of Respiratory Medicine,
Second People's Hospital of Gansu Province & Northwest Minzu
University Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China. 15
volunteers were from the Hospital too. They were recruited and accepted
the pharyngeal examination. The tumors, lesions and hyperplasia in
laryngeal part of pharynx were excluded. The Pharyngeal mucous were
sampled by an experienced technician who were passed the specifically
bio-safety training held by the management department of the affiliated
hospital of northwest university for nationalities. The technician was
required equipped with protective equipment according to the three levels
of protection according to the third level biological safety standard,
including work clothes, protective clothing, disposable working cap,
medical protective mask (N95), surgical mask, goggles, mask, double
gloves, waterproof boots and shoe covers. The oropharyngeal palatum

was divided into the same two parts by visualization, one of which was
sampled with flocked swab, and the other was sampled with silicone
swab. The swab stayed in the sampling area for 15-30 seconds, and was
gently rotated for 3-5 times. After the samples were obtained, both kinds
of swabs were placed separately into two tubes containing lysis solution
(Guangzhou BDS Biological Technology Co., Ltd). Then, the swab was
repeatedly squeezed on the inner wall of the collection tube for 10 times
and removed, so that the sample can be rinsed into the lysis solution as
much as possible. Then screwed the tube and sealed it for laboratory
testing. The RNA extraction process was referred to the instructions of
the kit (RNeasy Mini kit, QIAGEN, Germany). The extracted RNA was

Statistical methods
The comparison between the silicone group and the cotton group
were analyzed by a principal component analysis (PCA) across the
samples using the vegan package in R (version 3.6.2). Wilcoxon test was
performed to compare PC1 between the two groups using the vegan
package in R, as to PC1 with a nonnormal distribution. In addition, paired
