Abstract
Background: COVID-19 is a recent pandemic that started to spread out worldwide from
Wuhan, China. This disease is caused by a newly discovered strain of the coronavirus,
namely SARS CoV-2. Lung cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19
infection. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of
lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted two most crucial biomarkers of
COVID-19, ACE2 and CXCL10. ACE2 plays a vital role in the SARS CoV-2 entry into the
host cell while CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving
in a cytokine storm.
Methods: Firstly, we used the TIMER, UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases to analyze the
expression and correlation of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and LUSC. After that, using the
cBioPortal database, we performed an analytical study to determine the genetic changes in
ACE2 and CXCL10 protein sequences that are responsible for lung cancer development.
Finally, we analyzed different functional approaches of ACE2, CXCL10 and their coexpressed genes associated with lung cancer and COVID-19 development by using the
PANTHER database.
Results: Initially, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in LUAD
and LUSC. We also found the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer
development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences.
Lastly, by doing the functional assessment of the targeted genes, we identified that ACE2 and
CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are respectively involved in the
binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection.

1. Introduction:
In recent times, the corona viral disease 2019 (COVID-19) has noted as the most alarming
disease that occurs due to the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). This new strain is declared as the seventh modification of corona virus1,2.
The first COVID-19 disease infected patient was identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China
on December, 2019. Till the reporting date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 216 countries, area or
territories and in total 4,731,458 cases and 316,169 deaths were confirmed 3,4.
Variant types of comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease are marked
as the potential risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity 5. However, Cancer patients are
found as being more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 mediated infection rather than the persons
having other disease complications because of their suppressive immunogenic state 6. Recent
investigation by a Chinese research team suggests, 18 out of 1590 cases of COVID-19
patients had a cancer history. Moreover, among these 18 patients, 5 patients had lung cancer
(28%). In terms of fatality rate, a recent study in New York provides information that 6 out of
11 (55%) lung cancer patients died when infected by COVID-19

7,8

. All of these statistical

reports remark the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients due to COVID-19
infection. In this study, we aimed to find out the possible reasons behind this adverse
outcome by targeting two crucial genes responsible for COVID-19 disease development,
namely angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-X-C motif chemokine 10
(CXCL10).
ACE2 acts as the receptor of host cells for the SARS CoV-2 viral spike-protein S1. For that
reason, the entry of the viral particle is directly interconnected with the binding affinity of the
ACE2 receptor

9,10

. On the other hand, CXCL10 is reported as a crucial cytokine plays

significant role in proceeding the immune response to COVID-19 infected cells. In case of
severe condition, the secretion of CXCL10 and other cytokines is exceedingly over-regulated
that causes adverse assembly of cytokines which is known as cytokine storm (figure 1). This
cytokine storm is responsible for the rapid development of acute respiratory distress

syndrome (ARDS). In case of a prolonged severe condition, the cytokine storm also causes
the alveolar collapse by destruction of the lung cells11,12. Concerning these adverse outcomes,
we selected ACE2 and CXCL10 to identify the possible reasons for increased fatality rate of
lung cancer patients in case of COVID-19. Overall, we aimed for a comprehensive in silico
analysis on these two targeted genes to interpret the susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer
patients towards COVID-19 infection by using available validated data of multidisciplinary
databases.

2. Methods
2.1 Expression analysis of the targeted genes
2.1.1 Analysis of gene expression in lung cancer
Data corresponding to ACE2 and CXCL10 mRNA expression pattern in lung cancer was
retrieved from Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) (http://cistrome.org/TIMER/).
This tool allows comprehensive analysis of the immune suppressive nature of diverse cancer
types. This web resource consists of six principal catalogs of analysis which allow to analyze
the gene expression data and their interconnections along with the immune suppressed cancer
cells13.
2.1.2 Extensive Analysis of gene expression in LUAD and LUSC
In-depth expression analysis of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and LUSC was done by using
the TCGA data from the UALCAN web portal (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/). This is a public
accessible web platform that is frequently used to analyze the expression, co-expression of
multiple genes and their association with the clinical prognosis of variant cancer types by
utilizing the TCGA data. UALCAN provides the analytical data for 31 types of cancer 14.
2.1.3 Correlation analysis of the targeted genes in LUAD and LUSC
Gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) 2 database (http://gepia2.cancerpku.cn/#index) is a web portal to analyze the mRNA expression of 8,587 normal and 9,736
tumor samples using the TCGA data. Besides the expression analysis, this database is also
used for the gene specific correlation analysis of different cancer types

15

. Therefore,

investigation of the correlation impact of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and LUSC was
carried out by using the GEPIA 2 web portal.
2.2 Functional characterization of the targeted genes
2.2.1 Mutation and CNAs determination in the targeted proteins
Exploration of significant genetic changes in ACE2 and CXCL10 was done by using
cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/). This software is an interactive web portal for
systematic analysis of the multidisciplinary data sets of cancer genomics. Providing the data
from more than 5,000 tumor samples, this database is mostly used for the molecular profiling
of cell lines and cancer tissue, mapping the frequency of mutations and other genetic
alterations utilizing multidimensional cancer studies 16.

2.2.2 Development of protein-protein interaction network
Genes that are involved in COVID-19 development and predicted to have a dominant
association with the viral disease were retrieved from the Comparative Toxicogenomics
Database (CTD) (http://ctdbase.org/). CTD is a regularly updated database that delivers
readily understandable records representing the gene-disease relationships 17. To analyze the
interconnection between the proteins significantly associated with COVID-19, a network was
generated among them by using the STRING software (https://string-db.org/). This software
is mainly used to construct protein-protein interaction network for showing multi-variant
associations among the targeted proteins 18.
2.3 Co-expression analysis of the targeted genes
2.3.1 Identification of the co-expressed genes
The genes co-altered with the expression of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer were
identified

by

using

the

R2:

Genomics

and

Visualization

platform

(https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi). This database is an enriched resource of gene
specific datasets that allows to analyze, interpret and reveal prominent outcomes of clinical
research studies 19.
2.3.2 Determination of commonly co-expressed genes
The commonly co-altered genes of ACE2 and CXCL10 in both lung cancer and COVID-19
are determined by constructing the Venn diagrams using the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary
Genomics (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) web portal. The Venn diagram
can generate a graphical output which represents the common elements of each listed
intersection 20.
2.4 Interpretation of functional role of the targeted genes
An integrative molecular assessment of the functional approaches of ACE2 and CXCL10
associated with the lung cancer and fatal type of COVID-19 development was
attributed by using Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER)
(http://www.pantherdb.org/) tool. This is a comprehensive tool that can classify genes in
terms of various attributes such as biological procedures, cellular structures, molecular
attitudes and pathways 21,22.

3. Results
3.1 Expression of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer
Firstly, expression level of ACE2 and CXCL10 was analyzed by using TIMER web tool.
Here, we found that ACE2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) where p-value for LUAD was < 0.05
(Figure 3a). Increased level of expression was also showed by CXCL10 when compared to its
normal tissues. P-value < 0.01 was evidenced in both the cancer types for CXCL10 (Figure
3b). Overall, these results gave a clear indication that ACE2 and CXCL10 are overexpressed
in LUAD and LUSC.

3.2. Expression pattern and correlation analysis of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and
LUSC
Using the UALCAN web tool, we found an upregulated expression pattern of ACE2 in
LUAD and LUSC compared to the normal condition which is done on the basis of the TCGA
dataset of individual cancer stages and different age groups (Fig 4a-d). In terms of individual
cancer stages compared to normal condition, the ACE2 expression level was found higher in
stage 1-3 but not in stage 4 in case of LUSC (Fig 4a-b). A similar kind of outcome
representing the overexpression of ACE2 in terms of variant age groups was found, though
for age group of 41-60 years, a surprisingly down-regulation of the gene expression was
found (Fig 4c-d). On the other hand, for CXCL10 a significant over-expression was found in
all cancer stages and age groups for both LUAD and LUSC patients (Fig 4e-h).

After that, using the GEPIA2 web portal, we generated an interactive heatmap which
represents the correlation of ACE2 and CXCL10 along with both the cancer types, LUAD
and LUSC on the basis of their expression score. Both the genes showed a deeper correlation
when they were expressed by the tumor cells in comparison with normal cells (Fig 4i).

3.3. Analysis of genetic changes in ACE2 and CXCL10 protein sequences associated with
lung cancer development
To evaluate the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development,
we generated data representing multiple genetic alterations in ACE2 and CXCL10 mRNA
using the cBioPortal database. Firstly, we prepared a query for ACE2 in this database using
6075 samples of 5719 lung cancer patients from 21 studies. From this analysis, we found out
64 mutations at 24 different locations of the 805 amino acids long human ACE2 protein. Out
of these 64 mutations, 51 were missense type, while other 13 were recognized as truncated
type (Fig 5a). After that, we extended our analysis to explore the frequency of genetic
alterations in the ACE2 gene by using data from different lung cancer studies. Through this
analysis, we observed that ACE2 is mostly altered in LUSC ranging the highest frequency of
3.49%. Though the alteration frequency fluctuated variously in multiple types of lung cancer
studies, we managed to reveal that the least rate of alteration occurs in small cell lung cancer
(figure 5b). Then, we focused on the expression level analysis of unique types of genetic
alteration. In this case, we found that the highest level of mutation is occurred due to the
shallow deletion type of genetic alteration. The second most significant genetic change is
done by amplification type of copy number alteration. Variant natures of genetic alteration in
ACE2 are assembled to contribute in the lung cancer development (Figure 5c).
Next, we went through a similar type of analysis for interpreting the genetic alterations in the
CXCL10 mRNA regarding lung cancer. In this instance, we pointed out 6 missense type of
mutations with a somatic mutation frequency of 0.1% where 2 duplicate mutations were
present. The mutations are evidenced at 4 different locations of the 98 amino acids long
CXCL10 protein sequence (figure 5d). We then analyze genetic alteration frequency in the
CXCL10 mRNA distinct numbers of lung cancer studies. In this regard, we observed the
highest rate of alteration frequency (2.79%) in CXCL10 mRNA for LUSC. Interestingly,
amplification is the one and only type of alteration in this case. However, for other cases,
fluctuation in alteration frequency and changes in the nature of alteration was observed. For
instance, the TCGA data of LUSC represented alteration frequency only for amplification
type whereas UCOLOGENE 2015 revealed that alterations in CXCL10 of small cell lung
cancer are completely mediated by mutation type genetic change (Figure 5e). Last of all, we
did an extensive analysis of the different expression levels of unique alteration types in
CXCL10 mRNA. From this analysis, we experienced that amplification is the most
upregulated copy number alteration considering their level of expression while shallow

deletion is the most common type of alteration considering their expression frequency (Figure
5f). Overall, the functional characterization of ACE2 and CXCL10 by using multiple lung
cancer studies provides some of the vital evidence of their intimate relationship with lung
cancer development.

3.4. Evaluation of the ACE2 and CXCL10 assisted protein-protein interaction network
Multiple numbers of proteins are responsible directly or indirectly for COVID-19
development. To explore the interconnection among the most vital proteins associated
directly with this disease, first, we used the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).
Here, we managed to generate data of 12,347 genes associated with COVID-19 disease based
on their inference score. Most importantly, each of the genes has either curated association to
the disease or an inferred association via a curated chemical interaction. Extracting the huge
data set, the number of 15 curated genes were identified as the biomarkers or therapeutic
targets for COVID-19 treatment according to the information provided by CTD in which
ACE2 and CXCL10 were included. By utilizing the translated protein sequences of these 15
genes a protein-protein interaction network was constructed through the STRING database
(Figure 6). From this, we found out 74 connecting edges among 15 nodes of the selected
proteins, though the expected edges were only 16 according to the information provided by
the database itself. That means the network represents more interconnections than the
expected outcome. Such affluence indicates that the proteins are functionally connected, as a
group. Moreover, we found multiple numbers of interconnection for ACE2 and CXCL10
protein along with other topmost significant protein components associated with COVID-19
development. It is clear evidence that ACE2 and CXCL10 are crucial proteins contributing to
the COVID-19 disease progression.

3.5. Estimation of the commonly co-expressed genes of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer
and COVID-19
To identify the genes that are correlated with the expression of ACE2 and CXCL10, we went
through a comprehensive analysis by using the R2: Genomics and Visualization web portal.
From here, we explored the co-expressed genes of ACE2 and CXCL10 responsible for lung
cancer and COVID-19 development by utilizing the TCGA data. Here, we identified a total
6793 co-expressed genes of the ACE2 associated with LUAD and LUSC whereas the number
of co-expressed genes related to COVID-19 was 10803. On the other hand, we determined
5999 genes that are co-altered with CXCL10 in case of lung cancer development and 6430
co-expressed genes associated with COVID-19. A restriction of p-value < 0.01 was applied to
each case of analysis. After that, the lists representing co-expressed genes of ACE2 and
CXCL10 in both cases of lung cancer and COVID-19 were utilized to construct Venn
diagrams by using the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics web tool. The two Venn
diagrams revealed the commonly co-expressed genes of ACE2 and CXCL10 associated with
lung cancer and COVID-19 development. In case of ACE2, 3544 co-expressed genes were
identified commonly associated with both of the disease conditions (Figure 7a). On the other
hand, 2088 genes were identified which are co-altered along with the expression of CXCL10
in both cases of lung cancer and COVID-19 (Figure 7b).

3.6. Molecular assessment of the functional approaches of ACE2 and CXCL10
To interpret the functional activity of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer and COVID-19, we
used a list of genes including the targeted ones and their commonly co-expressed genes

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.119610; this version posted May 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

associated with both of these diseases using the PANTHER data analysis platform. First of
all, we processed a query for determining the molecular activity of ACE2 by listing the
previously identified 3544 commonly co-expressed genes. Following the next steps, we
analyzed multiple types of molecular activity in which a major portion (37.1%) of the genes
(803) are involved in the binding activity (Figure 8a). Through extended analysis, we
observed the variant nature of the binding activities of corresponding 803 genes. In this
instance, we found out that most of the genes are involved in protein binding activity (53.5%;
430 genes) (Figure 8b).
After that, we looked forward to investigating the functional attitude of CXCL10 using the
list of previously determined 2048 commonly co-expressed genes associated with lung cancer
and COVID-19 development. By analyzing the biological processes, we observed that the
listed genes are involved in performing a wide range of biological activities such as cellular
process, biological regulation, metabolic process, immune system process, localization,
biogenesis etc (Figure 8c). However, by remarking our research aims, we further looked
forward only to do an extended analysis with the genes involved in different immune
processes. Regarding this analysis, we explored that 46 genes are involved in immune
response, 5 genes act for immune system development, 12 genes are responsible for
leukocyte activation whereas 10 genes are responsible for leukocyte migration, 12 genes
contribute to the activation of immune response and 20 genes lead the immune effector
process (Figure 8d). Overall, along with the functional activity of CXCL10, many of the coexpressed genes are found to play important in various branches of the immune system.

4. Discussion
Recently, COVID-19 is remarked as the most threatened clinical pandemic of the century
which is showing more vulnerable attitudes towards cancer patients. Current statistical
reports claimed that among these COVID-19 infected cancer patients, the most frequent and
severe nature of infection has been found against lung cancer 7,23.
In this research study, we aimed to find out the possible reasons behind the higher
susceptibility and fatality rate of lung cancer patients to SARS CoV-2 mediated infection. To
proceed with an impactful study, we targeted the expression analysis of ACE2 and CXCL10
because of their crucial roles in viral entry and disease severity, respectively. The newest
scientific outcomes revealed that ACE2 acts as the main receptor of SARS CoV-2. Moreover,
the susceptibility of COVID-19 patients is directly interconnected with the binding affinity of
ACE2 to the S1 spike protein which is known as the receptor-binding domain of the virus 24.
On the other hand, CXCL10 is treated as one of the significant cytokines which is directly
involved in the occurrence of cytokine storm at the severe condition of the COVID-19
infection. This cytokine storm is directly associated with the prosecution of Acute
Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS)

11,25

. Moreover, at the severe stage of infection, the

cytokine storm causes the excessive secretion of cytokines in the alveoli. This enormous
assembly of cytokines suddenly gets involved in a suicidal approach by causing the damage
of the lung cells instead of providing the required immune response

26,27

. For being involved

with this severe prognosis of COVID-19, CXCL10 is predicted as a significant factor for the
fatality of COVID-19 patients. On the basis of these evidence, we analyzed the level of
ACE2 mRNA expression in LUAD and LUSC attributing multidisciplinary parameters.
Interestingly almost in all of the cases, we found an over-expression of ACE2 and CXCL10
in LUAD and LUSC compared to the normal condition. However, two contradictory results
of ACE2 expression were found in individual cancer stage-4 of LUSC and age group 41-60
years of LUAD and LUSC. Additionally, we applied a correlation analysis of ACE2 and
CXCL10 with LUAD and LUSC on the basis of their expression score by normal and tumor
cells. In this case, we observed a much deeper correlation of these two genes with LUAD and
LUSC when they are expressed by tumor cells. The results of this initial analysis may provide
a primary evidence that overexpression of ACE2 receptor and CXCL10 cytokine is one of the
major possible reasons behind increased susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients
towards COVID-19. To make the evidence stronger enough, we extended the analytical
process to the investigation on the functional assessment of ACE2 and CXCL10.

From the updated scientific outcomes, it is already clear that ACE2 and CXCL10 have a
strong correlation with COVID-19 infection development

2,11

. However, in the next part of

this study, we intended to provide an additional evidence to this scientific knowledge by
establishing a protein-protein interaction network among the topmost significant 15 proteins
responsible for the COVID-19 development including ACE2 and CXCL10. Following this
analysis, we found 74 nodes of interaction among the 15 proteins where the major portion of
the nodes based protein network is assisted by ACE2 and CXCL10. This provides an
extended evidence about the functional involvement and significant contribution of ACE2
and CXCL10 to the SARS CoV-2 mediated infection development. Besides confirming the
role of ACE2 and CXCL10 in COVID-19 development, we also realized the need of
determining their role in case of lung cancer development to establish a connection between
lung cancer and COVID-19 through these targeted genes. Therefore, we did the functional
characterization of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer by analyzing the mutations and copy
number alterations in their protein sequence based on 21 lung cancer studies. In total 64
mutations at 24 different locations of the ACE2 protein were found where the maximum
frequency of alteration is 3.49 %. On the other hand, 6 mutations at 4 different locations of
the protein sequence were found against CXCL10 where the highest level of alteration
frequency was 2.79%. For both cases, we observed that shallow deletion is the most frequent
type of CNAs. These results are supportive evidence assuring the active participation of
ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development.
After that, we looked forward to identify the commonly co-expressed genes of ACE2 and
CXCL10 associated with lung cancer and COVID-19. We constructed two Venn diagrams by
listing the co-expressed genes of ACE2 and CXCL10 in each cases of lung cancer and
COVID-19. Therefore, 3544 and 2088 commonly co-expressed genes associated with both
lung cancer and COVID-19 were identified for ACE2 and CXCL10, respectively. These
commonly co-expressed genes were utilized to interpret the functional attitudes of ACE2 and
CXCL10 both in lung cancer and COVID-19. By analyzing the molecular activity of the
3544 commonly co-expressed genes for ACE2, we found that 803 genes including the ACE2
are involved in the binding activity. The active participation of these commonly co-expressed
genes in binding activity can be beneficial for ACE2 to show a more efficient binding affinity
towards SARS CoV-2 viral spike protein. This functional enforcement of the receptor activity
of ACE2 may be increase the susceptibility of the lung cancer patients towards COVID-19.

commonly co-expressed genes associated with lung cancer and COVID-19. By analyzing the
biological activity of 2088 co-expressed genes, we found that 68 genes are directly involved
in the immune system including the CXCL10. At the early stage of our study, we showed an
over-expression of CXCL10 in lung cancer and by doing the functional analysis of CXCL10
we found its association with immune response. By combining these two analyses, we can
say that over expression of CXCL10 along with the presence of other cytokines causes
cytokine storm in the alveoli of the COVID-19 infected lung cancer patients. This cytokine
storm results in the alveolar collapse due to lung cell damage by excessive neutrophil
recruitment to the site of infection. In the prolonged severe condition, the damaged alveolus
causes decreased gas exchange and results in difficulty in breathing. Finally, the ultimate
destruction of the alveoli results in the stoppage of breathing and causes patient’s death

Overall, enforcing the viral entry and cytokine storm, the over-expressed ACE2 and CXCL10
become major factors of the higher susceptibility and fatality rate of the lung cancer patients
towards COVID-19 infection.
Concluding Remarks
From this study, we have gained valuable insights suggesting that ACE2 and CXCL10 are
vitally involved in SARS CoV-2 entry and its severity. The key findings of this research also
represented the overexpression and direct interconnection of ACE2 and CXCL10 with lung
cancer development. Therefore, on the basis of this systemic analysis, we can conclude that
ACE2 and CXCL10 are possible biomarkers whose higher expressions are responsible for the
greater susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19 infection.
However, we encourage further wet-lab research on our study outcomes to generate extended
information.
