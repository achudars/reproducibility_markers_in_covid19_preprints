IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19

24

Summary

25

Dysregulated IL-1β and IL-6 responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe Coronavirus

26

Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in

27

vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1β and IL-6 in COVID-19.

28

We show that the expression of IL-1β or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the

29

bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and

30

rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1β and IL-6 response modules, but not the

31

cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated

32

with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality. We propose that IL-1β and IL-6 transcriptional

33

response modules provide a dynamic readout of functional cytokine activity in vivo, aiding quantification of

34

the biological effects of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19

39

Introduction

40

Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically occurs over a week from symptom onset, when viral

41

titres have diminished, suggesting a dysregulated host inflammatory response may be driving the

42

pathogenesis of severe disease (Bullard et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; McGonagle et al., 2020). Elevated IL-

43

1β and IL-6 responses have each been associated with disease severity (Huang et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020;

44

Qin et al., 2020; Ravindra et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). In addition, the

45

hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 is reported to resemble some aspects of haemophagocytic

46

lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a condition that may benefit from therapeutic IL-1β blockade (Mehta et al.,

47

2020). These observations have generated hypotheses that IL-1β and/or IL-6 may be key drivers of pathology

48

in severe COVID-19, and led to clinical trials of IL-1β and IL-6 antagonists in this context (Maes et al., 2020).

49

Randomised studies to date investigating the role of tocilizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against

50

the IL-6 receptor, have shown no clinical benefit, but immunophenotyping beyond the measurement of

51

single cytokines, before or after drug administration, was not recorded or correlated with clinical responses

52

at the individual patient level (Hermine et al., 2020; Salvarani et al., 2020; Stone et al., 2020).

53

The measurement of individual cytokines at the protein or RNA level may not reflect their biological activity

54

accurately within multivariate immune systems that incorporate redundancy and feedback loops. To address

55

this limitation, we have previously derived and validated gene expression signatures, or modules,

56

representing the transcriptional response to cytokine stimulation, using them to measure functional

57

cytokine activity within genome-wide transcriptomic data from clinical samples (Bell et al., 2016; Byng-

58

Maddick et al., 2017; Dheda et al., 2019; Pollara et al., 2017). However, transcriptional modules to quantify

59

IL-1β or IL-6 response have not been used in COVID-19 to quantify the bioactivity of these cytokine pathways

60

in vivo. In the present study, we have sought to address this gap , describing the derivation and validation of

61

IL-1β and IL-6 inducible transcriptional modules, and testing the hypothesis that these modules can be used

62

in the molecular assessment of the pathophysiology and the response to therapeutic cytokine blockade of

63

inflammatory conditions, including COVID-19.

Results

66

Identification and validation of IL-1β and IL-6 transcriptional modules

67

We first sought to derive transcriptional modules that identified and discriminated between the response to

68

IL-1β and IL-6 stimulation. We have previously derived an IL-1β response module from cytokine stimulated

69

fibroblasts (table S2) (Pollara et al., 2019). As in our prior studies (Bell et al., 2016; Pollara et al., 2017, 2019),

70

we used the geometric mean of the constituent genes in a module as a summary statistic to describe the

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19
71

relative expression of the module. We demonstrate that in both monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM)

72

and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Boisson et al., 2012; Jura et al., 2008), IL-1β stimulation

73

induced greater expression of the IL-1β response module than either IL-6 or TNFa stimulation, where there

74

was no increased expression above unstimulated cells (Fig 1A + B). To identify an IL-6 response module

75

which was able to discriminate from the effects of IL-1β, we identified one study that had stimulated human

76

MDM with either IL-1β (15 ng/ml) or IL-6 (25 ng/ml) for 4 hours (Jura et al., 2008). Hierarchical clustering

77

identified genes induced by IL-6 but not IL-1β, and we termed this the IL-6 response module (table S2).

78

Internal validation of this module confirmed increased expression in IL-6 stimulated MDM (fig 1A). Testing

79

the IL-6 module in other datasets demonstrated elevated expression following IL-6, but not TNFa,

80

stimulation of human kidney epithelial and macrophage cell lines (Das et al., 2020; O’Brown et al., 2015) (figs

81

1C+D), whereas no elevated expression of the IL-6 module was observed following IL-1β or TNFa stimulation

82

of MDM or PBMC (figs 1A+B). These findings demonstrated that the IL-1β and IL-6 response modules could

83

detect the effects of their cognate cytokines, and discriminate these from each other and from an

84

alternative inflammatory cytokine stimulus, TNFa.

85
86

IL-1β and IL-6 module expression in chronic inflammation

87

To determine whether IL-1β and IL-6 response modules were able to detect elevated cytokine bioactivity in

88

vivo, we assessed the blood transcriptome of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

89

patients. These are conditions in which elevated IL-1β and IL-6 activity are considered to play a key role in

90

disease pathogenesis, evidenced by clinical improvement following therapeutic antagonism of these

91

cytokines (De Benedetti et al., 2012; Fleischmann, 2017; Nikfar et al., 2018; Ruperto et al., 2012). The blood

92

transcriptome of untreated JIA patients displayed elevated IL-1β and IL-6 bioactivity (fig 2A) (Brachat et al.,

93

2017), but this was not consistently evident in several RA blood transcriptome datasets (fig S1) (Lee et al.,

94

2020; Macías-Segura et al., 2018; Tasaki et al., 2018). Discrepancies between molecular changes in blood and

95

tissues have been previously described in RA (Lee et al., 2020), and therefore we tested the hypothesis that

96

in contrast to blood, elevated IL-1β and IL-6 bioactivity was a feature of the synovium in RA. Consistent with

97

this hypothesis, a separate transcriptomic dataset of synovial membrane biopsies from patients with RA

98

(Broeren et al., 2016) showed elevated levels of both IL-1β and IL-6 response module expression compared

99

to non-RA synovium (fig 2B).

100

We used the elevated cytokine activity in the blood of JIA patients to test the hypothesis that therapeutic

101

cytokine modulation would result in changes in cytokine bioactivity as determined by module expression.

102

We made use of the blood transcriptome of JIA patients 3 days following administration of canakinumab, a

103

human monoclonal antibody to IL-1β (Brachat et al., 2017). Patients who had a therapeutic response to

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19
104

canakinumab showed elevated IL-1β module expression which reduced 3 days after canakinumab

105

administration (fig 3A). In contrast, in those who had no treatment response, IL-1β module expression was

106

lower at baseline and was unaffected by canakinumab (fig 3A). Unlike the differences seen in the IL-1β

107

module between responders and non-responders, there were no differences between these groups in IL-6

108

module expression at baseline (fig 3B). This indicated that these two cytokine response modules quantified

109

two distinct biological processes. Interestingly, expression of the IL-6 module was also diminished after

110

canakinumab treatment in patients who responded to treatment, suggesting that IL-6 activity may be

111

downstream of IL-1β in this context. Of note in these populations, the expression of the IL1B gene correlated

112

with that of the IL-1β response module, but the same was not evident between IL-6 module and IL6 gene

113

expression (fig 3C), illustrating an example in which cytokine gene expression itself may not necessarily

114

reflect the functional activity of that cytokine.

115

IL-1β and IL-6 bioactivity in COVID-19

116

We tested the hypothesis that elevated IL-1β and IL-6 bioactivity is a feature of COVID-19 disease. We

117

initially explored the induction of IL-1β and IL-6 activity at the site of COVID-19 disease, by profiling

118

transcriptional responses in nasopharyngeal swabs from 495 control and 155 SARS-CoV-2 infected

119

individuals (Butler et al., 2020; Ramlall et al., 2020). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used as an

120

alternate method of module enrichment scoring (Subramanian et al., 2005), in line with previous analyses of

121

this data set (Ramlall et al., 2020). While the IL-1β response module was modestly induced by SARS-CoV-2

122

infection, the IL-6 response module was significantly enriched in transcriptional programs induced by this

123

viral infection (fig 4). Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were positively associated with

124

cytokine activity, with enrichment of IL-1β and IL-6 responses observed in individuals with the upper tertile

125

of measured viral loads, while patients with the lowest tertile viral titres did not show induction of responses

126

to either cytokine (fig 4). The greatest IL-6 responses were in fact observed in individuals with intermediate

127

viral titres, in whom significant induction of IL-1β activity was not seen (fig 4). Together, these findings

128

suggest that both IL-1β and IL-6 activity are a feature of the host response at the site of SARS-CoV-2

129

infection, and are likely to be driven by increasing viral replication in vivo.

130

As clinical deterioration in COVID-19 occurs after peak viral replication in the airways has subsided, we

131

tested the hypothesis that IL-1β and IL-6 activity was also related to disease severity. We initially explored IL-

132

1β and IL-6 activity in the blood of 3 patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 disease who were admitted to

133

hospital and recovered (Ong et al., 2020). This dataset was generated using the Nanostring system and

134

consisted of 579 mRNA targets, which included only 7/57 (12.2%) and 7/41 (17.1%) constituent genes of the

135

IL-1β and IL-6 response modules respectively (table S2). We demonstrated that IL-1β and IL-6 submodules,

136

generated from these shorter lists of constituent genes, were still able to recapitulate all the findings from

137

fig 3 (fig S2). The expression of these submodules in the blood transcriptome of this small number of COVID5

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19
138

19 patients revealed variation in IL-1β and IL-6 bioactivity over the period of hospitalisation, with higher

139

expression seen earlier during hospital admission and a reduction as patients recovered (Fig 5A). This time-

140

associated relationship with clinical recovery was not seen for the expression of the IL1A, IL1B and IL6 genes

141

(fig 5A). We extended these analyses by assessing the transcriptome of blood samples collected at the time

142

of hospital admission from 32 COVID-19 patients presenting with varying levels of disease severity (Hadjadj

143

et al., 2020). These data, also collected using the Nanostring system, revealed expression of the IL-1β and IL-

144

6 cytokine submodules was clearly elevated in COVID-19 compared to healthy controls (fig 5B). However,

145

strikingly, there was only minimal variability in IL-1β and no variability in IL-6 submodule expression between

146

the different levels of COVID-19 disease severity (fig 5B).

147

Finally, we tested the hypothesis that elevated IL-1β and IL-6 transcriptional activity in blood could predict

148

clinical outcome in COVID-19. We assessed the transcriptome of blood leucocytes from 101 COVID-19 and 24

149

non-COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (Overmyer et al., 2020). As seen in the whole blood

150

transcriptome analysis (fig 5), leucocytes from COVID-19 patients also demonstrated elevated IL-1β and IL-6

151

module activity compared to controls (fig 6A), and once again this distinction was not seen in IL1A, IL1B and

152

IL6 gene expression (fig S3). Clinical outcome in this cohort was determined from the number of hospital free

153

days at day 45 (HFD-45) following hospital admission, whereby zero days indicated continued admission or

154

death (Overmyer et al., 2020). Prognostication models have identified decreased lymphocyte counts as

155

predictors of clinical deterioration (Gupta et al., 2020). Focusing on COVID-19 patients not requiring ICU

156

admission, we reproduced this observation, demonstrating a positive correlation between HFD-45 and the

157

expression of a transcriptional module that reflects T cell frequency in vivo (Pollara et al., 2017) (fig 6B). In

158

contrast, neither IL-1β nor IL-6 response module expression at the time of study recruitment was associated

159

with HFD-45, indicating that, in this dataset, transcriptional activity of these cytokines was not predictive of

160

clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection (fig 6B).

161

Discussion

162

The protracted clinical course, inverse relationship between viral load and symptom progression, and the

163

association between inflammation and worse clinical outcomes support a hypothesis whereby severe

164

COVID-19 disease is predominantly driven by an exaggerated inflammatory response (Bullard et al., 2020;

165

Huang et al., 2020). Both IL-1β and IL-6 may play a role in this process (Huang et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020;

166

Qin et al., 2020; Ravindra et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a), and cytokine modulating

167

therapies are now being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. In this study we utilised transcriptional modules

168

derived from cytokine stimulated cells to demonstrate that their expression, but not that of their cognate

169

cytokine genes, provided a quantitative readout for cytokine bioactivity in vivo, both in the context of

170

COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory conditions.

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19
171

We show that in COVID-19, IL-1β and IL-6 cytokine activity is detectable at a site of disease, the nasopharynx,

172

where greater IL-6 bioactivity in particular is associated with higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 detected. This

173

finding indicates that the presence of viral antigen is associated with IL-6 mediated inflammation, although

174

we cannot ascertain from these experiments whether IL-6 inflammation persists in tissues in the later stages

175

of severe COVID-19 when viral titres diminish (Bullard et al., 2020). The elevated cytokine responses seen in

176

nasopharyngeal tissues were also detectable in the transcriptome of whole blood and isolated leucocytes

177

from COVID-19 patients compared to the control populations available, although this analysis merits being

178

extended to include a wider array of conditions associated with hyperinflammation (Leisman et al., 2020).

179

Although a reduction in cytokine activity tracked clinical recovery from illness, IL-1β and IL-6 activity at the

180

time of hospital attendance was not predictive for clinical outcome, and, in contrast to the association seen

181

with circulating levels of IL-6 protein (Thwaites et al., 2020), we observed no clear gradient of IL-1β or IL-6

182

response module expression with disease severity. Our findings may help explain the recent results from

183

randomised studies whereby neutralisation of IL-6 activity by tocilizumab did not show a benefit in mortality

184

or clinical recovery in patients with severe COVID-19 (Hermine et al., 2020; Salvarani et al., 2020; Stone et

185

al., 2020). However, these studies did not record IL-6 activity before or after tocilizumab administration,

186

precluding associations between cytokine activity, neutralisation efficiency and clinical outcomes. We

187

propose that future randomised trials will need to incorporate assessments of cytokine activity in study

188

protocols to permit mechanistic correlations between immunomodulatory interventions and disease

189

outcomes, promoting a stratified medicine approach to host-directed therapies in COVID-19.

190

A consistent observation in our work was that transcriptional modules identified differences between

191

patient groups that would not otherwise have been detected by assessment of cognate gene transcripts. An

192

interpretation of these findings is that the downstream response to cytokine stimulation is more persistent

193

than the expression of the cytokine gene mRNA, the stability of which is subject to trans-regulatory factors

194

and feedback loops (Iwasaki et al., 2011; Seko et al., 2006). Moreover, transcriptional modules are

195

intrinsically composed of genes with co-correlated expression, minimising technical confounding of single

196

gene measurements, demonstrated by the strongly concordant expression between the full and Nanostring

197

subset IL-1β and IL-6 response modules. These factors may explain the discordance recorded between IL-6

198

gene expression and protein secretion in COVID-19 (Hadjadj et al., 2020). Moreover, cytokine levels after

199

modulation in vivo do not necessarily reflect bioactivity, exemplified by the rise in IL-6 in blood following

200

administration of tocilizumab (Nishimoto et al., 2008). We propose that cytokine response modules

201

overcome both issues by integrating the culmination of cytokine signalling events, and may be used as an in

202

vivo biomonitor of cytokine activity (Hedrick et al., 2020).

203

Our study has limitations. Despite drawing on four independent COVID-19 datasets, the sample sizes

204
205

assessed in our study were still modest, especially for longitudinal samples, but this was limited by the data

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19
206

available. Assessments of the transcriptome from leucocytes and whole blood in COVID-19 may not be

207

interchangeable and will need cross-validating, although both datasets demonstrated no association

208

between IL-1β or IL-6 activity and severity of disease. Determining the sensitivity and specificity of the IL-1β

209

and IL-6 response modules for their respective cognate cytokines was limited by the available datasets and

210

the range of cytokine stimulation conditions performed in those experiments. Comparing the expression of

211

these modules across a wider range of biologically paired cytokine stimulations will allow refinement of their

212

accuracy. As the modules were generated from in vitro experiments, we sought to determine their

213

applicability in vivo, assessing neutralisation of cytokine activity following immunomodulation with biologic

214

agents in vivo. IL-1β activity in blood and in tissues was diminished days after canakinumab (fig 3) and

215

anakinra (Pollara et al., 2019) administration respectively, but no equivalent datasets were available to

216

assess the IL-6 response module in the same manner. Biobanked samples from ongoing tocilizumab clinical

217

trials in COVID-19 and other diseases may provide an opportunity to validate IL-6 module performance in

218

this way.

219

In conclusion, our data demonstrate elevated activity of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 in COVID-

220

19 in blood and tissues, and demonstrate the utility of cytokine transcriptional response modules in

221

providing a dynamic readout of the activity of these pathways in vivo. We propose that use of these modules

222

may enhance efforts to investigate the pathology of COVID-19, support development of methods to stratify

223

patients’ risk of clinical progression, and aid quantification of the biological effects of host-directed

224

immunomodulatory therapeutics in COVID-19.

Datasets

227

All datasets used are provided in table S1. Data matrices were obtained from processed data series

228

downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or Array

229

Express repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). Probe identifiers were converted to gene symbols

230

using platform annotations provided with each dataset. In circumstances where downloaded datasets were

231

not log2 transformed, this was performed on the entire processed data matrix. Duplicate genes were

232

removed after the first one identified using Microsoft Excel duplicate remover function.

IL-1β and IL-6 module derivation

234

We previously derived an IL-1β transcriptional module from the transcriptome of fibroblasts stimulated with

235

IL-1β or TNFa (Pollara et al., 2019). We derived a novel IL-6 transcriptional response module from a publicly

236

available dataset (table S1) reporting experiments of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM)

237

stimulated with IL-1β (15 ng/ml) or IL-6 (25 ng/ml) for 4 hours (Jura et al., 2008). In this study the

238

transcriptional programme of cytokine-stimulated MDM was assessed by microarrays and hierarchical

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19
239

clustering was performed using Euclidean distance and average linkage method. This approach identified

240

several unique clusters of genes differentially expressed following stimulation with each cytokine. Genes in

241

clusters D & E showed elevated expression following stimulation by IL-6, but not by IL-1β. We combined the

242

list of genes within these two clusters, removed duplicate or non-annotated genes, and termed this the IL-6

243

response module.

244

We applied the above IL-1β and IL-6 response modules to two studies where transcriptional profiling was

245

performed using the Nanostring nCounter Human Immunology_v2 panel, which assesses the expression of a

246

subset of the whole genome (579 genes) (Hadjadj et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020). Consequently, only a subset

247

of the modules’ constituent genes was present in these datasets (table S2). To verify the validity of applying

248

our method to these datasets, we generated new cytokine response submodules using only genes from this

249

subset, and showed them to provide the same discrimination of IL-1β and IL-6 responses as the parent

250

modules (fig S2).

251

Module expression assessment

252

The expression of transcriptional modules was derived by calculating the geometric mean expression of all

253

constituent genes, as previously described (Pollara et al., 2017). The scripts used allowed the absence of a

254

constituent gene in the analysed dataset, a scenario that did not affect geometric mean calculation. Gene set

255

enrichment analysis was also used for modular expression assessment in nasopharyngeal samples, as

256

previously described (Ramlall et al., 2020; Subramanian et al., 2005).

257

Statistical analysis

258

All module score calculations were calculated in R v3.6.1 and RStudio v1.2.1335, using scripts generated and

259

deposited in our previous publication (https://github.com/MJMurray1/MDIScoring) (Pollara et al., 2017).

260

Mann-Whitney tests, Spearman rank correlations and Kruskal-Wallis tests were calculated in GraphPad Prism

261

v8.4. Kruskal-Wallis testing was chosen to determine the presence of variability in the expression of cytokine

262

response modules or cytokine gene over time since hospital admission (fig 5A) or between different

263

categories of COVID-19 disease severity (fig 5B). This non-parametric test was chosen as we could not

264

assume the expression of these variables was Normally distributed. In fig 5A patient samples were aligned

265

according to days from hospital admission, and then binned into day interval categories (4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and

266

12+ days following admission), yielding 4, 7, 8 and 3 samples in each group. Kruskal-Wallis testing was

267

performed on these binned categories to identify variation in the expression of modules or genes between

268

these categories, with the Bonferroni method used for multiple testing correction.

The threshold for significance (q=0.05) is shown by the dotted lines; data points below the dotted lines are

452

significantly enriched for the relevant module in each group of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, in comparison

453

to the control group. B) Leading edge enrichment plots from GSEA of the cytokine modules for each

IL-1 and IL-6 response modules in COVID-19

Figure 5. Cytokine response module and gene expression in COVID-19 blood samples. A) Geometric mean

456

expression of IL-1β and IL-6 response module and IL1A, IL1B and IL6 gene expression in patients admitted

457

with COVID-19 (Ong et al., 2020). Number of patient samples at each timepoint designated on first plot of

458

each row, but applicable for all panels. Where more than one sample was available at any time point, the

459

mean expression +/- SEM is plotted. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on binned time points 4-6, 7-9, 10-

460

12 and 12+ days following hospitalisation, corresponding to 4, 7, 8 and 3 samples in each of these categories.

461

The p values shown represent Kruskal-Wallis tests with time since hospital admission as the independent

462

variable, where a threshold of 0.01 (corrected for multiple testing by the Bonferroni method) is required for

463

a single test to be classed as significant (significant p-values indicated in bold text). B) Geometric mean

464

expression of IL-1β and IL-6 response modules in whole blood transcriptomic profiles from patients admitted

465

with moderate (n=11) severe (n=10) or critical (n=11) COVID-19, in comparison to healthy controls (n=13)

466

(Hadjadj et al., 2020). In this study, samples were collected from patients at the time of admission to

467

hospital, a median of 10 days (IQR 9 – 11 days) from symptom onset. A Mann-Whitney test was used to

468

assess differences in module expression between all COVID-19 patients and healthy controls (* = p < 0.05),

469

and a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine variability in module expression between the grades of

470

COVID-19 disease severity.

471

Figure 6. Relationship between cytokine response module expression at admission in COVID-19 and clinical

472

outcome. A) Geometric mean expression of IL-1β and IL-6 response modules in transcriptomic profiles of

473

blood leucocytes collected from 101 COVID-19 and 24 non-COVID-19 patients. In this study, samples were

474

collected from patients at a median of 3.37 days from admission to hospital (Overmyer et al., 2020) . B) In

475

patients from this cohort who were not admitted to ITU, the relationship between expression of cytokine

476

response modules, or a previously validated T-cell module (Pollara et al., 2017), and the number of hospital

477

free days at day 45 (HFD-45) following hospital admission (whereby zero days indicated continued admission

478

or death) is shown. Statistical assessment of correlation made by Spearman Rank correlation. r = correlation
