ABSTRACT
Individuals with systemic symptoms long after COVID-19 has cleared represent
approximately ~10% of all COVID-19 infected individuals. Here we present a
bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective
treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals
including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum.
We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals
with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals
with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine
panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to
predict and distinguish the groups from each other.Using a multi-class deep neural
network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision,
100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the
chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN-γ + IL-2 )/ CCL4-MIP-1β. Second,
a score specific for the severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (10*IL-10 + IL-6)
– (IL-2 + IL-8). Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and
dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic
patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells
with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune
response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract
activated T cells.

INTRODUCTION

93

Haulers”, who experience a multitude of symptoms from several weeks to months after

94

recovering from their acute illness and presumably months after viral clearance. These

95

symptoms include joint pain, muscle aches, fatigue, “brain fog” and others. These

96

symptoms can commonly resemble rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,

97

autoimmune disorders, and others such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome

98

(1). Many of these common disorders are caused by inflammation, hyper- and/or auto-

99

immunity and some such as chronic fatigue are associated with viral persistence after

Chronic COVID-19 is a group of previously infected individuals, so called “Long

100

an acute infection with pathogens such as Epstein Barr and Cytomegalovirus (2).

101

Recent studies including those from our laboratory have suggested that (CC) may be

102

caused by persistent COVID itself (3). Here, we sought to identify possible immunologic

103

signatures of COVID-19 severity and to determine whether Chronic COVID-19 might

104

represent a distinct immunologic entity compared to mild to moderate (MM) or

105

severe/critical COVID-19. Further, we addressed the question whether the immunologic

106

profile represents an immune response indicative of prolonged or chronic antigenic

107

exposure. Using machine learning, we identified algorithms that allowed for accurate

108

determination of chronic COVID and severe COVID immunotypes. Further, we present

109

a quantitative immunologic score that could be used to stratify patients to therapy and/or

110

non-subjectively measure response to therapy.

RESULTS

115

Immune Profiling

116

To determine if immunologic abnormalities remain in Long Haulers, we performed high

117

parameter immune cell quantification and characterization in a subset of individuals with

118

preserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We determined B-cells, T-cells, and

119

monocytes including subsets and including CD4/CD8 activation and exhaustion. Unlike

120

active COVID-19, the CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations were within normal limits and

121

there was no evidence of T-cell exhaustion (co-expression of PD-1, LAG3, and or

122

CTLA-4). B-cells were significantly elevated compared to normal individuals (P<0.001)

123

as was the CD14+, CD16+ monocytic subset (P<0.001) (Table 1). Interestingly, these

124

two immune cell populations have been shown to be chronically infected by different

125

viruses. B-cells are infected by Epstein-Barr and the CD14+, CD16+ monocytic subset

126

by HIV-1 and by HCV (4).

127

To further characterize the immune response in Long Haulers, we performed

128

quantitative, multiplex cytokine/chemokine panel on 30 normal individuals to establish

129

the normal range of the assay. We then analyzed 64 long haulers and compared the

130

cytokine/chemokine profile (Table 1). IL-2, IL-4, CCL3, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and VEGF

131

were all significantly elevated compared to normal control (all P<0.001). Conversely

132

GM-CSF and CCL4 were significantly lower than normal controls. Further exacerbating

133

this hyper-immunity was the significant decrease in T regulatory cells compared to

134

normal individuals (P<0.001).

136

Random Forest Binary and Multi-Class Models for Feature Selection and Prediction

137

We separated the dataset into a training and test split of 90% training and 10% test.

138

This proportion was used because of the reduced number of instances in the dataset.

139

Also, to ensure reproducible results we set the same random seed for all the models.

140

The first model we constructed was the multi-class predictor. This model attempted to

141

separate the severe, long hauler and non-severe-non-long hauler class. This classifier

142

achieved 97% precision, 97% recall and a F1 score of 0.97 in the training partition. In

143

the test split, it performed slightly better, with a precision of 100%, a recall of 100% and

144

thus and F1 score of 1.00 (Table 2). This model was then analyzed to identify the most

145

relevant or informative features. This resulted in the identification of 6 features with an

146

importance score above the importance median (0.063895) and average (0.07143). The

147

identified features were: IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, CCL4-MIP-1β, in importance

148

order. The full list of ranked features can be seen in figure 2.

149

Regarding the long hauler and non-long hauler binary classifier, our results were

150

consistent between the training and the test set. In both partitions the precision and the

151

recall were 100% (1.00) and thus the F1 score equaled 1.00. The observation that the

152

model had good metrics in the test split when compared to the train set is a valuable

153

indicator that the model is not overfitting, and that it is capable of generalizing the

154

patters identified in the training data. The overview of the precision, recall and F1 score

155

for the binary long hauler model can be seen in table 2. Feature importance analysis of

156

the binary model, revealed that the features identified as important for this model were

157

the same features identified as important for the multi-class predictor. This finding

158

suggests there is an important group of characteristics or variables that are influential in

159

the identification of long hauler data points from other instances. These features can be

160

seen in figure 2.

161

The severe binary model, which classified instances between non-severe and severe

162

resulted in high performance metrics for both the training and test splits. As shown in

163

table 2, the performance of this model was an indicator of no potential overfitting. This

164

model is of special interest given the small number of instances in the severe class.

165

Furthermore, the feature importance analysis of this model revealed that the relevant

166

features were also the same as with the multi-class model and with the long hauler

167

binary classifier (Figure 2). This finding reinforces our notion that these group of

168

relevant features could impact classification, or that could have some biological

169

significance worth exploring by means of other analysis like a separation heuristic.

170
171

Deep Neural Network Binary Classifiers using the Full Feature Set

172

The deep neural network (DNN) classifier was constructed layers of neurons. Each

173

layer transformed the inputs inputs using the rectified linear activation function or ReLU.

174

The DNN model was constructed to have 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers with 10 neurons

175

each, followed by layer with 6 neurons. Finally, the output layer consists of 3 neuros, for

176

the outputs (classes) and the softmax (multi-class) or sigmoid (binary) function. This

177

architecture was used for the multi-class model and the binary models.

179

The results of the long hauler binary models, revealed differences of ~5% between the

180

metrics of the training and the test set (Table 3). Such difference is not significant to

181

attribute overfitting to the training set. In contrast, the severe binary model had

182

significant differences between the performance metrics of the training and the test set

183

(Table 3). This is evident in the precision score, with 98% in the training set and 75% on

184

the test set, and thus the F1 score with a difference of 20% (0.99 on the training set and

185

0.79 on the test set). A potential explanation could be that the severe class has a limited

186

number of data points, but our random forest classifier for the severe class perfumed

187

well. These results suggest that the best approach is a multi-class predictor.

188
189

Multi-class Deep Neural Network Classifiers using the Full Feature Set

190

The multi-class DNN implemented using the full feature set had good metrics (Table 3).

191

The precision, recall and F1 score of 100%, 100% and 1.00 in the test split. This

192

indicates that the model is not overfitting, and validating our notion that this would

193

generalize better than the binary models. The model’s performance is supported by its

194

confusion matrix (true class vs predicted) where it is possible to determine how well it

195

can predict the three classes (Figure 3).

196

The potential of a DNN classifier is that it adjusts multiple parameters transform the

197

inputs into outputs. This is very important because the vast number of parameters

198

allows for the model to better identify hidden signals in the data. Also, DNN require

199

hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate, number of hidden layers and neurons per

200

hidden layer, as well as the optimizer and activation function, which affect the

201

performance of the model. By adjusting these hyperparameters and castrating a model

202

capable of finding the hidden relationships in the data we were able to achieve such

203

high results and construct a predictive multi-class system.

204

Reduced Feature Multi-class Deep Neural Network Classifiers

205

The results of the DNN indicated that the multi-class had the highest performance.

206

Based on this, we constructed a DNN using the 6 most important features identified by

207

the random forest variable importance. This model was known as minimal DNN or

208

mDNN. This model was constructed using the same architecture as the full feature set

209

DNN. This model’s performance in the training set and the test set (Table 4), revealed a

210

significant difference in both precision and recall, such difference could indicate that

211

although the 6 features were identified as the most relevant, it could be possible that all

212

variables contribute to the hidden pattern that makes up the classification of the

213

instances. This idea is supported by the differences in performance between the mDNN

214

and the full feature classifier in both training and test splits (Tables 3 & 4). This is further

215

supported by the comparison of the confusion matrices, where mDNN (figure 4A)

216

misclassifies more instances than the full feature multi-class DNN (Figure 3).

217

Moreover, we simplified our prediction model by feature engineering of two classification

218

scores based on the top informative features. First, a “Long Hauler Score” was defined

219

as S1 = (IFN-γ + IL-2 ) / CCL4-MIP-1β. Second, “Severe Score” was defined as S2 =

220

(10*IL-10 + IL-6) – (IL-2 + IL8). Using a combined heuristic to first classify the Long

221

Haulers (S1>0.4) and second the severe COVID-19 patients (S2>0), we obtained a

222

sensitivity of 97% for Long Haulers with a 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 88% for

223

severe patients with a specificity of 96% (Figure 4B).

224
225

DISCUSSION

226
227

Individuals infected with SARS-Cov2 exert distinct severity patterns which have been

228

associated with different immune activation profiles. Interestingly, in some cases longer

229

times are required to experience full recovery, representing a particular pathological

230

type recently described as long-COVID or long haulers (LH). The scientific evidence

231

generated during the last months strongly supports that the different outcomes on

232

COVID-19 patients are determined by the immune mechanisms activated in response to

233

the viral infection.

234

The immune response to SARS-Cov2 induces a release of different molecules with

235

inflammatory properties such as cytokines and chemokines. This event, known as

236

cytokine storm, is an immunopathological feature of COVID-19 and it has been

237

associated with the severity of the disease. The increase in blood concentrations of

238

different cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IP-10,

239

MCP-1, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 has been described for COVID-19 patients (5). Some

240

of these molecules have been proposed as biomarkers to monitor the clinical evolution

241

and to determine treatment selection for COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, it is

242

important to consider that some of these molecules function in a context dependent

243

manner, therefore the clinical relevance of analyzing single cytokine changes is limited.

244

One of the most important challenges during the pandemics is to avoid the saturation of

245

the health systems, therefore the determination of predictive biomarkers that allow a

246

better stratification of the patients is paramount. Even though cytokines such as IL-6

247

and IL-8 have been proposed as indicators of the disease severity, and in some studies

248

they were strong and independent predictors of patient survival (6), their predictive

249

value when analyzed alone is debatable (7). The generation of scores considering blood

250

levels of cytokines and chemokines with different immunological functions incorporates

251

the importance of the context-dependent function of these molecules.

252

In order to predict severe cases, a score was generated considering IL-10, IL-6, IL-2,

253

and IL-8 blood concentrations. In this classification, severe cases are characterized by

254

high IL-6 and IL-10 levels, both cytokines previously attributed to increase the

255

immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 and predictive value in severe cases (6, 8). In

256

different settings, IL-6 has been associated with oxidative stress, inflammation,

257

endothelial dysfunction, and thrombogenesis (9-12) which are characteristic features of

258

severe COVID-19 cases caused by excessive myeloid cell activation (13). Consistently,

259

increased IL-10 levels interfere with appropriate T-cell responses, inducing T-cell

260

exhaustion and regulatory T cell polarization leading to an evasion of the antiviral

261

immune response (14). Furthermore, besides its anti-inflammatory function on T cells, in

262

some settings IL-10 induces STAT1 activation and a pro-inflammatory response in type

263

I IFN-primed myeloid cells (15,16). Therefore, elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 promote

264

myeloid cell activation, oxidative stress, endothelial damage, and dampens adequate T

265

cell activation. Additionally, to strengthen the classification, the score presented here,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.423122; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

266

differentiates the severe cases by the subtraction of IL-2 and IL-8, which are cytokines

267

related to proper T cell activation (IL-2) and recruitment (IL-8).

268

According to the score generated for distinguishing LH, these patients are characterized

269

by an increased IFN-γ and IL-2 and a reduced CCL4 production. In the context of a viral

270

infection, the combination of IFN-γ and IL-2 would induce the activation of effector T

271

cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective

272

immune response to eliminate the virus. However, LH are characterized by longer

273

periods of time with clinical signs and symptoms such as fatigue and lung damage. This

274

suggests that the inflammatory context created by these cytokines to induce T cell

275

activation is not enough to generate an adequate anti-viral response without the proper

276

recruitment signals to attract activated T cells. CCL4 signals through the receptor CCR5

277

to attract T cells to the site of inflammation and depending on the immune context, this

278

molecule recruits differently activated T cells (17,18). Moreover, it was recently shown

279

by single cell analysis a down regulation of CCL4 expression in peripheral myeloid cell

280

compartments in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (19). In LH, IFN-γ and IL-2

281

would create an immune context to induce Th1 polarization, but the low levels of CCL4

282

affect the recruitment of these cells impairing the antiviral response. The effect of

283

increased IFN-γ and IL-2 on T cell activation is evident in the reduction of the

284

percentage of exhausted (CD4+PD1+/ CD8+PD1+) and regulatory T cells (FoxP3+)

285

compared to healthy donors. Interestingly, there is an increase in the percentage of

286

circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing CTLA-4 in the LH group compared to

287

healthy donors, which is a molecule that affects antigen presentation in secondary

288

lymphoid organs, but its presence in circulating T cells may reflect a compensatory

289

mechanisms to the low CCL4 levels in the LH group. CTLA-4 induced signaling in T

290

cells upregulates the expression of the CCL4 receptor CCR5 (20, 21), in the LH group

291

CTLA-4 upregulation suggests a failed attempt to increase the sensitivity of IFN-γ/IL-2

292

activated T cells to CCL4. Therefore, proper T cell activation (high IFN-γ+IL-2) but

293

ineffective T cell recruitment (low CCL4) are characteristic features of the failed anti-

294

viral response observed in the LH group supporting virus persistence. Additionally,

295

increased IFN-γ promotes myeloid cell activation which is observed in the augmented

296

percentage of inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in the LH group compared to

297

healthy donors, supporting lymphopenia and virus persistence in these patients. This is

298

supported by recent findings describing an increased gene expression in response to

299

IFN-γ in mild and severe COVID-19 patients in peripheral myeloid cells (19) and the

300

dysregulation in the balance of monocyte populations by the expansion of the monocyte

301

subsets described in COVID-19 patients (22). Finally, we propose that long-lasting

302

pulmonary damage observed in LH, is caused by a combination of factors including 1)

303

longer virus persistence influenced by LH immune profile characterized by high IFN-γ

304

and IL-2 levels inducing Th1 polarization which is ineffective with low CCL4-induced T

305

cell recruitment, leading to an inflammatory myeloid cell activation; and 2) the

306

immunopathological pulmonary effects consequence of this LH immune profile.

307

Regarding the immunopathological effects of LH immune profile, using murine models it

308

has been shown that high IFN-γ levels could affect the kinetics of the resolution of

309

inflammation-induced lung injury as well as thrombus resolution (23, 24), which could be

310

related to long-lasting symptoms of LH associated to pulmonary coagulopathy and

311

immune-mediated tissue damage.

312

Interestingly, COVID-19 individuals (including LH, mild, severe) show high levels of

313

CCL5, a chemoattractant that like CCL4 signals through CCR5. Indeed, the disruption

314

of the CCL5-CCR5 pathway restores immune balance in critical COVID-19 patients (4).

315

In the specific case of LH, despite the high concentrations of CCL5 a reduction on the

316

CCL4-mediated recruitment of activated T cells is proposed. This could be related to

317

different factors:

318

(1) Reduction of total recruitment signals in LH with low CCL4 concentrations.

319

(2) Different functional responses of CCL4 and CCL5 to polymorphic variants of the

320

CCR5. Distinct functional features have been reported to CCR5 variants regarding

321

binding avidity, receptor internalization, Ca++ influx and chemotactic activity (25). Even

322

though, clear mechanistic differences between CCL4 and CCL5 interaction with CCR5

323

are missing, it has been suggested that is important to consider the knowledge gained

324

on CCR5 polymorphisms in HIV/AIDS context (26).

325

(3) Signaling through alternative receptors for CCL5. Besides CCR5, CCL5 can signal

326

through the receptors CCR1 and CCR3 (27) whereas CCL4 effects are restricted to

327

CCL5. It has been shown that CCL4 can bind to CCR1 but is not able to induce the

328

intracellular pathway necessary for activating the chemoattractant stimulus (27,28) .

329

Therefore, CCL4 has been proposed as an antagonist of CCR1 (28), however further

330

analysis of this needs to be performed. Interestingly, CCR1 is expressed on blood

331

myeloid cells such as monocytes and neutrophils (27), and it is upregulated on COVID-

332

19 patients (29). Additionally, high levels of IFN-γ (feature of LH) have been associated

333

with an increase CCR1 expression on human neutrophils (30). Therefore, in LH, high

levels of CCL5 (combined with low levels of potential CCR1-antagonist CCL4) leads to

335

a higher recruitment of myeloid cells expressing CCR1.

Multiplex Cytokine Quantification

382

Fresh plasma was used for cytokine quantification using a customized 14-plex bead

383

based flow cytometric assay (IncellKINE, IncellDx, Inc) on a CytoFlex flow cytometer as

384

previously described using the following analytes: 'TNF-α', 'IL-4', 'IL-13','IL-2', 'GM-

385

CSF', 'sCD40L', 'CCL5 (RANTES)', 'CCL3 (MIP-1α)','IL-6', 'IL-10', 'IFN-γ', 'VEGF', 'IL-

386

8', and 'CCL4 (MIP-1β) (4). For each patient sample, 25 µL of plasma was used in each

387

well of a 96-well plate. Standard curves with serial 6 point dilutions of antigen were run

388

on each plate for each cytokine. Raw data was analyzed using LegendPlex software

389

(Biolegend, Inc San Diego CA). Samples were run in duplicate.

391

Data Processing

392

Data was imported and processed using Python 2.7, using the pandas library (version

393

1.1.0). and the numeric python module, numpy version 1.18.5. Our data consisted of

394

144 instances representing 4 classes (Normal-n=29, Mild-Moderate-n=26, Severe-n=25,

395

Long Hauler-n=64). Each class had 14 columns, representing the different

396

cytokine/chemokine analytes. Each analyte had different measurements which required

397

a normalization process to reduce outlier effect and to facilitate algorithm convergence.

398

Normalization was done using Min-Max and based on a linear transformation of the

399

original data. Min-Max maintains the original relationship between the data, while fitting

400

it within a pre-defined boundary. The Python implementation of min-max calculates the

401

range in such a manner that the range of the features will be defined between 0 and 1.

402

For this reason, min-max normalization is also referred to as 0-1 normalization (or

403

scaling). The typical min-max transformation is given in equation 1:

404
405

𝑋𝑋 =

(𝑋𝑋−𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋)

𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋−𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋

[1]

406
407
408

Target Variable Processing

409

Since Min-max normalization, can only be applied to numeric variables a new variable

410

defined as targets was created.The variable targets represent the different classes

411

(Long Hauler, Severe, Mild-Moderate, and Normal) for the instances in the dataset. The

412

resulting array has 4 classes for each state. The goal of our analysis is to properly

413

identify/discriminate the instances that belong to the Severe state or the Long-Hauler

414

state compared to other states. This goal can be achieved by building either binary

415

classifiers for the Severe class and for the Long Hauler class, a multi-class predictor.

416

For the construction of both models, t is required to separate the targets to reflect the

417

dosing question: can a predictor discriminate between the Severe, Long Hauler and

418

Other Sates.

419

To build the models that answer this question, we grouped the M-M and Normal labels

420

in a new class which was distinct form the Severe and Long-Hauler states. We then

421

proceeded to apply filters based on the task (binary or multi-class classification). For the

422

Severe binary predictor, we conditioned the targets to be exactly Severe or else they

423

were assigned to Not-Severe. This same task was done for Long-Haulers, were either

424

an instance label was exactly labelled Long-Hauler or else it would be assigned to the

425

Non-Long Hauler class. The multi-class predictor processing only requires to define

426

three classes: Severe, Long-Hauler and Non-Severe-Non-Long-Hauler which was

427

composed of the Normal and Mild-Moderate cases.

428
429

One-hot Encoding of Targets

430

The implementation of one-hot encoding on the target variable, is based on the notion

431

that multiple machine learning algorithms are unable to properly process categorical

432

data. It is possible to use numeric replacements, such as integer values, but this can

433

only be useful if there is an ordinal relationship within the variable. Such use would

434

imply that there exists a vectorial relationship between the labels, for example, in our

435

classes we have Normal, Mild-Moderate, Severe and Long-Haulers. If we assigned a

436

vector of integers from 0 to 4 in their corresponding orders to the classes, it would

437

assume the presence of a vectorial distance between Normal and Long Hauler or V0 ->

438

V4.

439

To properly design an experiment that reflects this, we use one-hot encoding After

440

applying one-hot encoding the labels are substituted with 1 and 0, where 1 represents

441

the presence of the class and 0 the absence. The use of one-jot encoding corrects for

442

the vector-distance assumption of integer or categorical classes, where higher or larger

443

values could be interpreted as better.

444
445

Definition of precision, recall and F1 score

446

The precision (equation 2) is a measure of the percentage of the results that are

447

relevant. The metric Recall measures the percentage of the total relevant results that

448

are correctly classified by the predictor (equation 3). The harmonic mean between these

449

two measures is known as the F1 score and ranges from 0 to 1, the closer to is to 1, the

450

better the model performs (equation 4). The F1 score for both false positives (FP) and

451

false negatives (FN) as well as for true positives (TP).

Feature Selection and Classification using Random Forest

457

Data pre-processing, target variable processing and the encoding of targets were

458

performed before classification as above. Feature selection is the process of reducing

459

dimensionality of the dataset by selecting those features or variables that are more

460

informative than those that are not.

461

To perform feature selection, we implemented the RandomForestClassifier method from

462

Sci-kit Learn. Random Forest allows for identification of features that better separate the

463

classes by determining what percentage of the nodes that use those features have a

464

reduction in entropy or impurity (which are measures of how well separated the

465

instances are using a feature).

466

The binary classifier was constructed using the data points and their features with the

467

one-hot encoded target corresponding to: 1) the severe and non-severe model, 2) the

468

long hauler and non-long hauler model and 3) the multiclass model. The model was

469

built with the RandomForestClassifier method from Sci-kit Learn, with the number of

470

trees constructed set to 750, the number of features set as the square root of the

471

feature space, and the node depth equal to 4 to avoid overfitting. These parameters

472

were set for binary and multi-class predictors. Model performance was measured using:

473

precision, recall and the F1 score (see supplementary information).

474
475

Predictor Construction Using Deep Neural Networks

476

The deep neural network (DNN) binary and multiclass classifiers were constructed with

477

a basic DNN architecture built on stacks of perceptrons, where each subsequent layer

478

is connected to the previous one. Each layer transformed the inputs inputs using the

479

rectified linear activation function or ReLU. The DNN models were constructed to have

480

1 input layer, 3 hidden layers with 10 neurons each, followed by layer with 6 neurons.

481

Finally, the output layer consists of 3 neurons, for the outputs (classes) and the softmax

482

(multi-class) or sigmoid (binary) function.

483

In order for a DNN to generate the best possible predictions, we minimized the loss

484

function or error of the model using the ADAM optimizer to search for the optimal

485

combination of hyperparameters. When setting the optimizer, we defined the learning

486

rate to 1e-3. The loss function was set to categorical cross entropy because the targets

487

are one-hot encoded.
