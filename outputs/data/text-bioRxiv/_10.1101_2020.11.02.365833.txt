106

Previous research has shown that IAVs and CoVs can be inactivated by metal surfaces, such

107

as copper and zinc (22-24). While the exact underlying inactivation mechanisms are not

108

fully understood, evidence suggests that metal ions can induce RNA hydrolysis, membrane

109

destabilisation, or viral protein inactivation or degradation (25-27). So far, few studies have

110

investigated if metal ions embedded in fabrics can inactivate RNA viruses, in part because

111

absorbance and fabric density differences among fabrics present confounding factors that

112

the protocols approved for testing the inactivating properties of surfaces do not account

113

for.

114

115

To tackle some of these confounding issues, we here measured the ability of different

116

fabrics, such as cotton, polyamide 6.6 (PA66) and polypropylene (PPP), to trap H1N1 IAV

117

and pandemic SARS-CoV-2, and we explore how we can remove these viruses from the

118

fabrics to test for inactivation. We find that cotton and PA66 readily absorb respiratory

Influenza virus absorbance by cotton, polypropylene and polyamide

129

Various studies have investigated the filtration properties of fabrics and have investigated

130

factors such as breathability, hydrophobicity and/or electrostaticity. Fabrics also have a

131

different weight per square meter (gram/m ) and different moisture retention abilities, with

132

cotton absorbing up to 500% of its weight and PA66 absorbing as little as 0.3% of its

133

weight, depending on environmental conditions (29). These different properties may affect

138

virus particle absorption. To investigate this relationship, we added IAV strain A/WSN/33

(H1N1) to International Antimicrobial Council (IAC) issued cotton, a textile PA66 fabric, or

140

PPP from a disposable type II 3-ply face mask (Fig. 1A). After a 30-min incubation at room

141

temperature, the fabrics were washed with PBS to remove unabsorbed virus (Fig. 1B). To

142

estimate the amount of remaining liquid on each fabric, each sample tube with fabric was

143

weighed and compared to its dry weight. As shown in Fig. 1C and D, cotton and PA66

cotton and woven PA66 fabrics readily absorbed the applied virus, while less virus was

observed by the PPP fabric (Fig. 1E, F), which is in line with the hydrophobicity of PPP (30).

167

In order to remove IAV from the cotton and PA66 fabrics without inactivating the virus, we

168

added different concentrations of polysorbate-80 (tween-80) - a mild detergent that is also

169

used in IAV vaccine preparations - to the PBS wash buffer (Fig. 1G). We did not observe any

170

cytopathic effects of the detergent on the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells used

171

for the plaque assay, but did find that the presence of 0.05%-0.1% tween-80 increased the

172

apparent viral titer relative to infections in PBS (Fig. 1G), whereas 0.25-0.5% tween-80

173

reduced the apparent IAV plaque size (Fig. 1G). We found that 0.05% tween-80 succeeded

174

in recovering more than 94% of the virus from the PA66 woven fabric, whereas 61% was

175

removed from the cotton fabric (Fig. 1H and I). Higher concentrations, such as 1% tween-

176

80, prevented IAV infection (Fig. 1I).

177

178

To confirm whether other viruses can be removed from cotton and woven PA66 as well, we

179

repeated the experiment with SARS-CoV-2. We found that over 92% of SARS-CoV-2 can be

180

recovered from the woven PA66 fabric using 0.05% tween-80, while up to 59% could be

181

recovered from the cotton fabric (Fig. 1J). Together, these results demonstrate that IAV

182

and

183

materials would trap respiratory viruses inside face masks. At the same time, these findings

imply that PPP is poor at trapping respiratory viruses. Since IAV and SARS-CoV-2 can be

Copper and zinc surfaces or particles can inactivate IAV strains and seasonal CoV HCoV-

192

embedding into polymers, zinc ions provide benefits over copper ions as zinc has a much

potential. Moreover, zinc oxide, which we embedded in the PA66 polymer used here, is

231

232

233

Influenza and coronavirus strains are inactivated on fabrics containing zinc ions

234

The above results suggest that zinc ions can directly inactivate an IAV H1N1 strain. To

235

investigate if these inactivating properties are also present when zinc ions are embedded in

236

a PA66 matrix, we used 0.4 gram of a textile PA66 fabric containing 328 ppm zinc ions

237

(equivalent to 2.5 mM; abbreviated as KF1). Incubation of KF1 with virus and washing of the

238

fabrics using a PBS buffer containing 0.05% tween-80 and 10 mM EDTA (PBSTE; Fig. 3A),

239

resulted in an approximately 2-log reduction of the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 titers compared to

240

a PA66 control fabric after 1 h (Fig. 3B and C). To confirm that inactivation of these viruses

241

occurred on KF1, viral protein levels were analysed in the PBSTE wash eluate by western

242

blot (Fig. 3D and E). Any virus that remained in the fabric after extraction with PBSTE, was

244

showed a reduction in the HA and S protein level in the virus eluate that was removed from

245

the KF1 fabric compared to the control fabric eluate for IAV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively

246

(Fig. 3D and E). The signal obtained from the virus that remained on each fabric after the

247

PBSTE extraction was close to background, in line with the observations in Fig. 1, and we

248

were only able to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 signal, but observed no statistically significant

249

difference. Overall, we conclude that inactivation of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 occurs on a fabric

250

embedded with zinc oxide, analogous to the previously observed effects of copper oxide

251

(31). To better investigate the rate of reduction, we incubated KF1 with virus for different

Infections with respiratory RNA viruses cause regular seasonal epidemics and occasional

pandemics, and thus present a severe burden on our personal health, healthcare systems,

and economy. While seasonal respiratory viruses - including over 160 different rhinoviruses,

known or potential problem. In the absence of new vaccines or antivirals, one way to fight

312

RNA viruses is to limit respiratory virus spread through efficient PPE.

313

314

To better understand how respiratory RNA viruses are absorbed and inactivated on fabrics,

315

we here added IAV and SARS-CoV-2 to cotton, PA66, and PPP. We find strong absorption

316

by cotton and PA66 in the standard laboratory buffer PBS, and that addition of tween-80

317

results in efficient virus release from PA66, but not from cotton. A previous clinical trial

318

found that cotton masks with strong absorbing properties may be associated with a higher

319

risk of infection when reused and our finding that cotton does not release IAV or SARS-

320

CoV-2

321

retention on PPP, which is used for the construction of disposable 3-ply masks, is poor, in

322

line with its hydrophobic properties (30). This result implies that respiratory viruses remain

323

on the surface of these masks and together with findings that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on

324

various surfaces for several hours to days, and even 7 days on PPP-based surgical face

325

masks (19, 32), PPP-based masks may increase the risk of infection if not handled and

326

disposed of properly. However, PPP has of course alternative properties, such as good

breathability, filtration, and electrostatic properties and will thus has a purpose in the right

336

ions (25). Research has shown that zinc and copper ions can also induce oxidative reactions,
