Abstract
Although infection by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is spreading rapidly
worldwide, no drug has been shown to be sufficiently effective for treating COVID-19. We
previously found that nafamostat mesylate, an existing drug used for disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), effectively blocked MERS-CoV S protein-initiated cell
fusion by targeting TMPRSS2, and inhibited MERS-CoV infection of human lung
epithelium-derived Calu-3 cells. Here we established a quantitative fusion assay dependent
on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and found that nafamostat mesylate
potently inhibited the fusion while camostat mesylate was about 10-fold less active.
Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an
EC50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous
administration through continuous infusion. These findings, together with accumulated
clinical data regarding its safety, make nafamostat a likely candidate drug to treat COVID19.

Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
agent of coronavirus pneumonia disease (COVID-19), is spreading rapidly worldwide1. As
yet, no drug has been shown to be sufficiently effective for treating COVID-19. Therefore,
drug repurposing offers potentially the quickest path toward disease treatment.
The genomic RNA of coronaviruses is surrounded by an envelope2. Initiation of
viral entry requires two steps: 1) the Spike (S) protein in the viral envelope, binds to its
receptor present in the plasma membrane after S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 proteins
by the cellular protease. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2), while MERS-CoV uses CD26 as a receptor; 2) S2 is cleaved by a cell surface
transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), so-called priming, which exposes the fusion
peptide in S2 protein, allowing it to attach to the plasma membrane resulting in the fusion
between envelope and the plasma membrane (envelope fusion). This fusion allows the viral
RNA to enter the cytoplasm, where it replicates. TMPRSS2-knockout resulted in reduced
spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the airways accompanied by reduced severity of
lung pathology in a mouse model3. Therefore, TMPRSS2 is likely crucial for SARS-CoV-2
spreading and disease development in vivo, and targeting it either by inhibiting its priming
activity or suppressing its expression is likely to be an effective strategy to cure COVID-19.

We have previously reported that nafamostat mesylate, an existing Japanese drug
used for acute pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with enhanced
fibrinolysis, effectively inhibits MERS-CoV S protein-initiated membrane fusion by
targeting TMPRSS2 priming activity4. We did this using the cell fusion assay monitored by
the Dual Split Protein (DSP) reporter to screen the FDA-approved drug library (Fig. 1a).
Nafamostat mesylate potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection of lung epithelium-derived
Calu-3 cells.
Based on our previous work4 together with others’5, we established an experimental
system monitoring SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion, and tested ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 dependence in 293FT cells, which do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1bd). Fusion did not occur when target cells lacked either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1c),
indicating that the cell fusion clearly depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as previously reported
for MERS-CoV S protein-initiated fusion, which depends on CD26 and TMPRSS24
(Supplementary information, Fig. S1a). Furthermore, when ACE2-kockout Calu-3 cells,
endogenously expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were used as target cells, fusion scarcely
occurred, suggesting that no other functional receptor exists in some types of lung epithelial
cells (Fig. 1e).

We then tested the activity of three existing Japanese drugs used for pancreatitis
and/or DIC (nafamostat mesylate, camostat mesylate and gabexate mesylate) with inhibitory
activity against serine proteases to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated fusion (Fig. 1f).
Luciferase activities derived from cells carrying the preformed DSP1-7/DSP8-11 reporter
complex were not affected by the drugs (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b), indicating
that the suppression of luciferase activities reflects the inhibition of fusion by drugs.
Nafamostat mesylate showed greatest activity, camostat mesylate was 10-fold less active,
and gabexate mesylate was inactive within the range of concentrations tested (10 nM-10 µM)
(Fig. 1d, f), which mirrors drug sensitivity profiles to MERS-CoV S protein-initiated fusion4
(Supplementary information, Fig. S1c).
We next used lung epithelium-derived Calu-3 and H3255 cells as target cells,
because they endogenously express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and might better reflect
physiological conditions than 293FT kidney cells ectopically expressing ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. Nafamostat mesylate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane
fusion in the range of 1-10 nM while camostat mesylate required 10 -100 nM to achieve a
similar extent of inhibition (Fig. 1g). A similar inhibition profile was observed when MERSCoV S protein-initiated fusion was analyzed4 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1d).

Therefore, nafamostat mesylate was 10-fold more potent than camostat mesylate.
Furthermore, drug concentrations required for fusion inhibition in lung epithelial cells were
10-fold lower than those required for inhibition using 293FT cells (Fig. 1f, g).
Various computational approaches have recently been applied to find existing
medications targeting TMPRSS26,7. Consistent with our results, these studies ranked
nafamostat mesylate significantly higher than camostat mesylate. It should be noted that
several world-wide commercially available anticoagulants, which are serine protease
inhibitors targeting Factor Xa or Thrombin, are listed. Therefore, we checked whether these
anticoagulants affect SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion. Contrary to
expectations, they all failed to inhibit membrane fusion (Fig. 1h).
Our DSP assays identified nafamostat mesylate as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 S-initiated membrane fusion (Fig. 1f, g). This inhibition was most likely a result of
inhibition of TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane2. SARS-CoV-2 infects Calu-3 cells
primarily via the TMPRSS2-dependent plasma membrane pathway4,5,8, while it infects
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells via the TMPRSS2-independent endocytotic pathway in addition to
the plasma membrane pathway9. We then proceeded to evaluate the effects of nafamostat
mesylate on actual SARS-CoV-2 infection in both types of cells with or without pretreatment

with nafamostat mesylate. Based on the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), EC50 values
for Calu-3 cells were 6.8-11.5 nM (with pretreatment) and 3.16 µM (without pretreatment)
while those for VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were 31.6 µM (with pretreatment) and >100 µM
(without pretreatment) (Fig. 1i). In both cell types, EC50 values were much smaller when
cells were pretreated with nafamostat mesylate, implying that nafamostat mesylate inhibits
SARS-CoV-2 entry. More importantly, EC50 values for Calu-3 cells with the pretreatment
were around 10 nM, similar to our previous findings with MERS-CoV infection4. This
extremely high sensitivity to nafamostat mesylate may be because the TMPRSS2-dependent
infection pathway is dominant in lung epithelium-derived Calu-3 cells4,5,8. Given that
camostat mesylate-mediated inhibition of TMPRSS2 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2
infection of primary human airway epithelial cells5 and that blood concentrations of
nafamostat mesylate were maintained at 30–240 nM when it was administered intravenously
through continuous infusion according to the standard protocol for DIC patients10, nafamostat
mesylate could be used to treat COVID-19. In contrast, significantly higher doses of
nafamostat mesylate are required to block SARS-CoV-2 infection of monkey kidney
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells as reported previously11, which is probably due to the significant
contribution of the TMPRSS2-independent endocytotic infection pathway. Because a

pharmacokinetics study using rats revealed the maximum concentration of intact nafamostat
mesylate in the lung after infusion to be about 60-fold higher in comparison with the
maximum blood concentration12, such an accumulation may partially suppress SARS-CoV2 infection of low-responder cells like VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Therefore, identification and
characterization of cells that play a key role in virus spread and disease development is
required.
Our findings clearly indicate that nafamostat mesylate, the most effective TMPRSS2
inhibitor so far reported, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Hoffmann et al.
have recently reported that Nafamostat mesylate blocks activation of SARS-CoV-213.
However here we clearly demonstrate that nafamostat mesylate blocks membrane fusion step
of the virus entry and its activity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection is cell type dependent.
These findings are crucial for developing therapeutic strategies. It has been reported recently
that abnormal coagulation with elevated concentrations of D-dimer, characteristic of DIC
with enhanced fibrinolysis, may influence the prognosis of COVID-1914,15. Furthermore, in
a murine asthma model, nafamostat mesylate attenuates respiratory inflammation by
blocking activation of NF-kB, a critical transcription factor for inflammatory cytokine
production16. Therefore, nafamostat mesylate is expected to have multiple therapeutic effects.

Because nafamostat mesylate has been prescribed in Japan for many years and adequate
clinical data regarding safety have accumulated, we suggest that it should be evaluated in
COVID-19 patients by itself or in combination with other antiviral drugs that target separate
processes needed for virus production.

lentiviruses were produced using HEK293T cells with lentiviral transfer plasmid expressing
S protein, psPAX2 packaging plasmid and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G-expressing
plasmid. For establishment of stable cell lines expressing ACE2 or CD26, and TMPRSS2,
recombinant pseudotype retroviruses expressing one of these proteins were produced using
plat-E cells with a VSV-G-expressing plasmid18. 293FT-derived reporter cells infected with
pseudotype viruses were selected with 1 µg/ml puromycin, 10 µg/ml blasticidin, and 300
µg/ml hygromycin for at least 1 week. These bulk selected cells were used to perform fusion
assays. Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55) and H3255 cells (CVCL_6831), lung epithelial cellderived immortalized cells established from human lung cancer, were used as target cells for
the fusion and viral infection assays. For establishment of ACE2-knockout Calu-3 cells,
lentiviruses were produced by transfecting lentiCRISPRv2 vector (#52961 Addgene,
Watertown, MA, USA) with the following gRNA sequences. The gRNA sequences used
were 5’-GCT TTC ACG GAG GTT CGA CG and 5’- ATG TTG CAG TTC GGC TCG AT
for control, and 5’-ATG AGC ACC ATC TAC AGT AC and 5’-TGC TGC TCA GTC CAC
CAT TG for ACE2-knockout. Pooled Calu-3 cells infected with pseudotype viruses were
selected with 1 µg/ml puromycin.

Construction of expression vectors. Expression vectors for CD26 and TMPRSS2 were
described previously4. A synthetic DNA corresponding to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2
(NC_045512.2) was generated by Taihe Gene (Beijing, China). For construction of
expression vectors for ACE2, the ACE2 gene was cloned into a pMXs-internal ribosome
entry site (IRES)-blasticidin retroviral vector2. For construction of expression vectors for S
protein of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, the coding regions were cloned into a lentiviral
transfer plasmid (CD500B-1, SBI, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
DSP assay to monitor membrane fusion. For the DSP assay using 293FT cells, effector
cells expressing S protein with DSP8-11 and target cells expressing CD26 or ACE2, and
TMPRSS2 with DSP1-7 were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates (2 x 105 cells/500 µl) one
day before the assay. Two hours before the DSP assay, cells were treated with 6 µM EnduRen
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), a substrate for Renilla luciferase, to activate EnduRen. One
µl of each protease inhibitor or anticoagulant dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was
added to the 384-well plates (Greiner Bioscience, Frickenhausen, Germany). Next, 50 µl of
each single cell suspension (effector and target cells) was added to the wells using a
Multidrop dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After incubation at 37°C for
4 h, the RL activity was measured using a Centro xS960 luminometer (Berthold, Germany).

For the DSP assay using Calu-3 or H3255 cells, target cells were seeded in 384-well plates
(2 x 104 cells/50 µl) one day before the assay. Two hours before the DSP assay, cells were
treated with 6 µM EnduRen. One µl of each protease inhibitor or anticoagulant dissolved in
DMSO was added to the 384-well plates with 9 µl of culture medium. Next, 40 µl of single
cell suspension (effector cells) was added to the wells using a Multidrop dispenser.
Western blotting. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously19. The
primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-ACE2 (1:1000, ab15348 Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA) and anti-GAPDH (1:1000, sc-25778 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA).

minimal essential media (MEM) containing 10% FBS. The cells were incubated at 37 °C
with 5% CO2, and regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination by using PCR and were
confirmed to be mycoplasma-free. Respiratory swabs were obtained from a patient with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, who was hospitalized at the Center Hospital of the
National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. The swabs were submitted
to the Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of

functional RL and GFP to generate luminescent and fluorescent signals, respectively. b
Effector cells (293FT cells expressing DSP8-11 and S protein) and target cells (293FT or
Calu-3 cells expressing DSP1-7, ACE2 and TMPRSS2) were co-cultured. Both GFP
(fluorescence) and RL (luminescence) signals were generated following DSP1-7 and DSP811 reassociation upon cell fusion. c Different combinations of the effector and target cells
were cocultured, and the resulting RL activity was measured. Relative cell-fusion values
were calculated by normalizing the RL activity of each co-culture to that of the co-culture of
cells expressing S protein with those expressing both receptor and TMPRSS2, which was set
to 100%. d Phase contrast images of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated-cell fusion. Scale bars,

clinically used pancreatitis and/or anticoagulant drugs were evaluated by the DSP assay for
their effects on SARS-CoV-2 S-initiated membrane fusion. Relative cell-fusion value was

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 or Calu-3 cells were either untreated or pretreated with nafamostat
mesylate (1-105 nM) for 1 h. SARS-CoV-2 was then added followed by 30 min incubation,
and the culture medium was changed to fresh medium with the same concentration of
nafamostat mesylate. Three or 5 days after infection, EC50 was determined. Experiments were
done in quadruplicate.
