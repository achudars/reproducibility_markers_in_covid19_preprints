ABSTRACT

18

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified RNA

19

virus that causes the serious infection Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The incidence of

20

COVID-19 is still increasing worldwide despite the summer heat and cool winter. However, little

21

is known about seasonal stability of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD)

22

simulations to explore the effect of temperature on four critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our work

23

demonstrates that the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Main protease (Mpro), and

24

nonstructural protein 3 (macro X) possesses extreme thermos-stability when subjected to

25

temperature variations rendering them attractive drug targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest

26

that these four proteins are well adapted to habitable temperatures on earth and are largely

27

insensitive to cold and warm climates. Furthermore, we report that the critical residues in SARS-

28

CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as compared to the critical residues in

29

SARS-CoV. As such, extreme summer and winter climates, and the transition between the two

30

seasons, are expected to have a negligible effect on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which will

31

marginally suppress transmission rates until effective therapeutics are available world-wide.

BACKGROUND

37

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the

38

global spread of the respiratory illness Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).1 On March 11,

39

2020, World Health Organization (WHO) publicly declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a

40

pandemic.2 As of January 24, 2021, over 100 million cases have been confirmed worldwide,

41

resulting in over two million deaths. This global public health crisis began during the peak of

42

winter in the norther hemisphere where the average temperature during the winter months from

43

December to March, averages at 273K (3°C). Several vaccine candidates have now been approved

44

and are currently being distributed world-wide.3 At present, there are very few reports that

45

investigate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in response to changes in temperature.

46

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is comprised of nearly 30,000 nucleotides. These nucleotides encodes

47

four structural proteins including the spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E)

48

protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein.4,5 The envelope glycoprotein spike (S) attaches to host cells

49

during infection through binding with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2).6 The spike

50

glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor and cleaved into two subunits, including S1 and S2. The

51

S1 contains the RBD, which has critical amino acids required for interaction with cellular ACE-

52

2.6

53

Of the four proteins, Mpro is one of the most attractive viral targets for antiviral drug discovery

54

against SARS-CoV-2 receiving major attention during the first SARS-CoV outbreak in 2004.5

55

Viral proteases have proven to be well-validated drug targets against chronic infections caused by

56

the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).5 Mpro plays a crucial role

57

during viral replication by cleaving overlapping polyproteins to mature functional proteins.5

58

Consequently, inhibiting Mpro can stall the production of viral particles and therefore suppress the

59

symptoms and severity of the COVID-19 infection.

60

The macro X domain is one of the most novel proteins of SARS-CoV-2 encoded by nonstructural

61

protein 3 (nsp3).7 Nsp3 is a large multidomain membrane-bound protein, and its clearest role in

62

viral replication is cleaving the rep polyprotein.7 Although the biological role of ADP-ribose

63

binding is still poorly understood, macro X domain is also a promising drug target.7

64

Of all the structural proteins, the N protein is a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed

65

during infection.7 Although the SARS–CoV-2 S protein is currently being used as a leading target

66

antigen in vaccine development the complex mechanisms of viral entry lends itself to

67

complications in vaccine response.7 In contrast to the SARS–CoV-2 S protein, the N gene is more

68

conserved and stable, with 90% amino acid homology and fewer mutations over time, also making

69

it an ideal drug target.2,7

70

To date, the rate of infection worldwide has unarguably demonstrated that SARS–CoV-2 is quite

71

stable when subjected to cold and warm temperatures.8 However, the effects of temperature on the

72

RBD, Mpro, macro X, and the nucleocapsid protein remains unclear and requires urgent clarity

73

with respect to their potential as stable drug targets.

METHODS

76

SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB: 6VW1), Mpro (PDB: 6M03), macro X (PDB: 6YWL), nucleocapsid

77

(PDB: 6M3M) and SARS-CoV RDB (PDB: 2AJF) were cleaned, side chains were fixed, and the

78

structures were minimized. CMIP titration was performed and then the system was solvated in

79

transferable intermolecular potential with 3 points (TIP3P) water molecules and ions were added

80

to equalize the total system charge. The steepest decent algorithm was used for initial energy

81

minimization until the system converged at Fmax 500 kJ/ (mol · nm). Water and ions were allowed

82

to equilibrate around the protein in two phases. The first phase of equilibration was at a constant

83

number of particles, volume, and temperature (NVT) while the second phase was at a constant

84

number of particles, pressure, and temperature (NPT). The system was allowed to equilibrate at a

85

reference temperature of 300 K, or reference pressure of 1 bar for 2.5 ps at a time step of 2 fs. The

86

production simulations were performed for 50 ns with 2 fs time intervals at 255K( -18°C), 261K( -

87

12°C), 266K(-7°C), 272K(-1°C), 277K(3.85°C°C), 283K(10°C), 288K(15°C), 294K(15°C),

88

300K(27°C), 305K((32°C), 310K((37°C), 322K(49°C), 333K(60°C), 344K(71°C), 355K(82°C),

89

366K(93°C), 377k(104°C). RMSD were calculated for the RBD, Mpro, macro X, and

90

nucleocapsid. While RMSF was extracted for the subRBD which is comprised of the critical

91

residues responsible for the initial interaction with ACE-2. RMSF was also determined for

92

randomly selected residues throughout the RBD from the N-terminus to the C-terminus for

93

standardization. Average structures at each temperature were generated as Protein Data Bank

94

(PDB) files and Audio Video Interleave (AVI) files for simulation playback. Data analysis and

95

correlation plots were generated using SPSS, Prism 5 and Python.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

98

Relating RMSD and protein stability

99

Herein, we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the effect of temperature on

100

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, Mpro, macro X and the nucleocapsid. We observed that subjecting the

101

proteins to changes in temperature, from 255K(-18°C) to 322K(49°C), which corresponds to the

102

transition from the peak of winter to the peak of summer. The videos for MD simulation of these

103

four proteins at temperature 255K and 322K were provided as supporting information. We found

104

that these four proteins had predominantly negligible effects as shown on the Root Mean Square

105

Deviation (RMSD)(Fig. S1-S4). RMSDs of Cα-atoms of a protein as a function of simulation time

106

give an estimate of the stability of protein structure. Macro X was demonstrated to be the most

107

thermo-stable protein with very negligible changes in average RMSD across the temperature series

108

(Fig. 1). The nucleocapsid on the other hand, was the least thermos-stable protein with an average

109

RMSD of 2 Å across the temperature series. The RBD and Mpro had comparable stability

110

averaging 0.5 Å in RMSD (Fig. 1).

111

It is also worthwhile noting that the nucleocapsid demonstrated the lowest average kinetic energy

112

(KE) across the temperature series while Mpro had the highest average KE. Macro X and the RBD

113

had comparable KE and were the least responsive when subjected to the temperature series. Our

114

findings suggest that the RBD, Mpro, and Maco X, are inherently thermos-stable, rendering them

115

ideal drug targets with potentially desirable drug binding kinetics. This is because secondary

116

structural changes are often a consequence of inhibitor binding. As such, monitoring variations in

117

secondary structures as a function of simulation time is instrumental in determining the formation

118

of a stable protein-inhibitor complex.

119

RMSF of the critical residues in the RBD

120

Next, we investigated the effect of temperature on the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) of

121

the critical residues in the RBD. These residues are ultimately responsible for initializing the

122

interaction with ACE-2, the entry point for the infection of pneumocytes in the lungs. We report

123

that the critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as

124

compared to the critical residues in SARS-CoV (Fig. 2). It is worthwhile noting that the critical

125

residues are predominantly located on the subRBD of both strains. This is consistent with the

126

understanding that sequence regions involved in binding tend to show significant interspecific,

127

temperature-related differences in flexibility.9

128

We further discriminated amongst the critical residues and inferred that L455, G482, and V483

129

had negligible responses to the change in temperature from 255K to 377K.2 This provides further

130

insight into the individual roles of the of critical residues with respect to the enhanced rigidity, and

131

thermal stability of the subRBD.2

132

This increased degree of rigidity in the SARS-CoV-2 subRBD, and, still yet, enigmatically

133

enhanced flexibility of the global RBD is perhaps a strategic evolutionary mutation that can at

134

minimum, partly explain the increased affinity and likely increased specificity for ACE-2.

135

Conventionally, it is understood that flexibility is positively correlated with specificity.9-12

136

Whereas, increased rigidity is correlated with increased affinity.12 Flexibility and affinity are

137

generally regarded as inverse correlates.9,11,12 Thus, the elevated rigidity and reduced flexibility in

138

the SARS-CoV-2 subRBD might be the driving force behind the significantly enhanced increase

139

in affinity for ACE-2 (Fig. 3). Likewise, the overall increase in globular flexibility of SARS-CoV-

140

2 RBD may have far-reaching implications with regards to its specificity for ACE-2 (Fig. 3).

141

Nevertheless, there are practical limitations that must be considered as well. We have only

142

computationally evaluated the thermo-stability of four critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins in response

143

to temperature changes within an aqueous environment. However, this is not a comprehensive

144

assessment of the plentiful proteins and conditions that exist as SARS-CoV-2 lingers within our

145

communities. For instance, how is the stability of the RBD affected by surfaces such as cloth,

146

wood and metal?13 Furthermore, it is not a trivial task to attempt simulating changes in humidity

147

using MD simulations, despite its intimate relationship with temperature. Also, our MD

148

simulations did not take into account the complex N-linked glycan at reside N-343 found on the

149

core RBD.14 The shielding of receptor binding sites by glycans is a common feature of viral

150

glycoproteins, which is consistent with that observed in SARS-CoV.14

151
152

Last, we have only considered the RBD, Mpro, macro X, and the nucleocapsid, which is but a

153

small fraction of the entire pathogen. MD simulations are also currently incapable of simulating

154

the homeostatic responses of the internal viral proteins and their complex interactions when

155

subjected to extreme environmental parameters like changes in pH, pressure, and humidity along

156

with temperature variations. Finally, the coronavirus machinery is intriguingly complex and may

157

have other stabilizing mechanisms and protein-protein interactions to cope with environmental

158

stresses that is brought forth during the transition between summer and fall, fall and winter, winter

159

and spring, and spring and summer.

CONCLUSION

165

In conclusion, the evolution of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 suggests a complex evolutionary,

166

advantageous interplay that has resulted in this profound global pandemic (Fig 3.). Furthermore,

167

the implications of our study suggests that four essential SARS-CoV-2 proteins are well adapted

168

to habitable temperatures on earth and exhibit extreme thermo-stability.15 As a consequence, we

169

have thus far observed a negligible effect on the transmitability of SARS-CoV-2 with respect to

170

changes in temperature between the winter months and summer months. More importantly, our

171

study establishes a framework for elucidating stable promising drug targets for SARS-CoV-2.

residue mutations have resulted in a RBD that more versatile, more efficient and more resistant to

257

temperature variations. This implication of this evolution is evidenced by the high transmitability

258

of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV.
