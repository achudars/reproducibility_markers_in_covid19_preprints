ABSTRACT

24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-like-CoVs

25

encode 3 tandem macrodomains within non-structural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain,

26

Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR)

27

from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a

28

posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is

29

essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a

30

virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-

31

CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1

32

exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low μM affinities.

33

Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel

34

ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the

35

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In

36

addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-

37

CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that

38

compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.

IMPORTANCE

41

SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide

42

pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 900 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no

43

currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All

44

coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes

45

ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly

46

recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for

47

CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry

48

and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of

49

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and

50

hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These

51

results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this

52

unique protein domain.

INTRODUCTION

55

The recently emerged pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus

56

named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). As of September

57

16, 2020, this virus has been responsible for ~ 30 million cases of COVID-19 and >900,000

58

deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the lineage B β-CoVs with overall high

59

sequence similarity with other SARS-like CoVs, including SARS-CoV. While most of the

60

genome is >80% similar with SARS-CoV, there are regions where amino acid conservation is

61

significantly lower. As expected, the most divergent proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome from

62

SARS-CoV include the Spike glycoprotein and several accessory proteins including 8a (absent),

63

8b (extended), and 3b (truncated). However, somewhat unexpectedly, several non-structural

64

proteins also show significant divergence from SARS-CoV, including non-structural proteins 3,

65

4, and 7, which could affect the biology of SARS-CoV-2 (3, 4).

66

Coronaviruses encode 16 non-structural proteins that are translated from two open

67

reading frames (ORFs), replicase 1a and 1ab (rep1a and rep1ab) (5). The largest non-structural

68

protein is the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) that encodes for multiple modular protein domains.

69

These domains in SARS-CoV-2 diverge in amino acid sequence from SARS-CoV as much as

70

30%, and SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 includes a large insertion of 25-41 residues just upstream of the

71

first of three tandem macrodomains (Mac1, Mac2, and Mac3) (Fig. 1A) (3). In addition to this

72

insertion, the individual macrodomains show large amounts of amino acid divergence. Mac1

73

diverges 28% from SARS-CoV and 59% from MERS-CoV, while Mac2 and Mac3 diverge 24%

74

from SARS-CoV. It is feasible that these significant sequence differences could impact the

75

unique biology of SARS-CoV-2. However, macrodomains have a highly conserved structure,

76

and thus sequence divergence may have little impact on their overall function. Mac1 is present in

77

all CoVs, unlike Mac2 and Mac3, and early structural and biochemical data demonstrated that it

78

contains a conserved three-layered α/β/α fold and binds to mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and other

79

related molecules (6-10). This is unlike Mac2 and Mac3, which fail to bind ADP-ribose and

80

instead appear to bind to nucleic acids (11, 12). ADP-ribose is buried in a hydrophobic cleft of

81

Mac1 where the ADP-ribose binds to several highly-conserved residues such as aspartic acid at

82

position 23 (D23) and asparagine at position 41 (N41) of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1B) (6). Mac1

83

homologs are also found in alphaviruses, Hepatitis E virus, and Rubella virus, and structural

84

analysis of these macrodomains have demonstrated that they are very similar to CoV Mac1 (13,

85

14). All are members of the larger MacroD-type macrodomain family, which includes human

86

macrodomains Mdo1 and Mdo2 (15).

87

The CoV Mac1 was originally named ADP-ribose-1”-phosphatase (ADRP) based on data

88

demonstrating that it could remove the phosphate group from ADP-ribose-1”-phosphate (6-8).

89

However, the activity was rather modest, and it was unclear why this would impact a virus

90

infection. More recently it has been demonstrated that CoV Mac1 can hydrolyze the bond

91

between amino acid chains and ADP-ribose molecules (16-18), indicating that it can reverse

92

protein ADP-ribosylation (6, 8). ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification catalyzed

93

by ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs, also known as PARPs) through transferring an ADP-ribose

94

moiety from NAD+ onto target proteins (19). The ADP-ribose is transferred as a single unit of

95

MAR, or single units of MAR are transferred consecutively to form a PAR chain. Several Mac1

96

proteins have been shown to hydrolyze MAR, but have minimal activity towards PAR (16, 17).

97

Several MARylating PARPs are induced by interferon (IFN) and are known to inhibit virus

98

replication, implicating MARylation in the host-response to infection (20).

99

Several reports have addressed the role of Mac1 on the replication and pathogenesis of

100

CoVs, mostly using the mutation of a highly conserved asparagine to alanine (N41A-SARS-

101

CoV). This mutation abolished the MAR-hydrolase activity of SARS-CoV Mac1 (18). This

102

mutation has minimal effects on CoV replication in transformed cells, but reduces viral load,

103

leads to enhanced IFN production, and strongly attenuates both murine hepatitis virus (MHV)

104

and SARS-CoV in mouse models of infection (7, 18, 21, 22). MHV Mac1 was also required for

105

efficient replication in primary macrophages, which could be partially rescued by the PARP

106

inhibitors XAV-939 and 3-AB or siRNA knockdown of PARP12 or PARP14 (23). These data

107

suggest that Mac1’s likely function is to counter PARP-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation

108

(24). Mutations in the alphavirus and HEV macrodomain also have substantial phenotypic

109

effects on virus replication and pathogenesis (16, 25-28). As viral macrodomains are clearly

110

important virulence factors, they are considered to be potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics

111

(24).

112

Based on the close structural similarities between viral macrodomains, we hypothesized

113

that SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 has similar binding and hydrolysis activity as other CoV Mac1

114

enzymes. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein

115

bound to ADP-ribose. Binding to and hydrolysis of MAR was tested and directly compared to a

116

human macrodomain (Mdo2) and the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins by several in

117

vitro assays. All CoV Mac1 proteins bound to MAR and could remove MAR from a protein

118

substrate. However, the initial rate associated with the loss of substrate was largest for the

119

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein , especially under multi-turnover conditions. In addition, none of

120

these enzymes could remove PAR from a protein substrate. These results indicate that Mac1

of novel therapeutic agents targeting the CoV Mac1 protein domain.

RESULTS

125

Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 complexed with ADP-ribose. To create recombinant

126

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 for structure determination and enzyme assays, nucleotides 3348-3872 of

127

SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-hu-1 (accession number NC_045512), representing amino acids

128

I1023-K1197 of rep1a, were cloned into a bacterial expression vector containing an N-terminal

129

6X-His tag and TEV cleavage site. We obtained large amounts (>100 mg) of purified

130

recombinant protein (Fig. S1A). A small amount of this protein was digested by the TEV

131

protease to obtain protein devoid of any extra tags for crystallization and used to obtain crystals

132

from which the structure was determined (Fig. S1B). Our crystallization experiments resulted in

133

the same crystal form (needle clusters) from several conditions, but only when ADP-ribose was

134

added to the protein. This represents an additional crystal form (P21) amongst the recently

135

determined SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain structures (29-31).

136

The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 complexed with ADP-ribose was obtained using X-

137

ray diffraction data to 2.2 Å resolution and contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit that

138

were nearly identical. The polypeptide chains could be traced from V3-M171 for subunits A/C

139

and V3-K172 for subunits B/D. Superposition of subunits B-D onto subunit A (169 residues

140

aligned) yielded RMSD deviations of 0.17 Å, 0.17 Å and 0.18 Å respectively between Cα atoms.

141

As such, subunit A was used for the majority of the structure analysis described herein. The

142

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein adopted a fold consistent with the MacroD sub-family of

143

macrodomains that contains a core composed of a mixed arrangement of 7 β-sheets (parallel and

144

antiparallel) that are flanked by 6 α-helices (Fig. 2A-B).

145
146

As mentioned above, apo crystals were never observed for our construct, though the apo
structure has been solved by researchers at The Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious

147

Diseases (PDB 6WEN) (30) and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (PDB 6WEY) (32).

148

Further analysis of the amino acid sequences used for expression and purification revealed that

149

our construct had 5 additional residues at the C-terminus (MKSEK) and differs slightly at the N-

150

terminus as well (GIE vs GE) relative to 6WEN. In addition, the sequence used to obtain the

151

structure of 6WEY is slightly shorter than SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 at both the N and C-terminal

152

regions (Fig. S2A). To assess the effect of these additional residues on crystallization, chain B

153

of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, which was traced to residue K172, was superimposed onto subunit A

154

of PDB 6W02 (31), a previously determined structure of ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1.

155

Analysis of the crystal packing of 6W02 indicates that the additional residues at the C-terminus

156

would clash with symmetry related molecules (Fig. S2B). This suggests that the presence of

157

these extra residues at the C-terminus likely prevented the generation of the more tightly packed

158

crystal forms obtained for 6W02 and 6WEY, which diffracted to high resolution.

159

The ADP-ribose binding pocket contained large regions of positive electron density

160

consistent with the docking of ADP-ribose (Fig. 3A). The adenine forms two hydrogen bonds

161

with D22-I23, which makes up a small loop between β2 and the N-terminal half of α1. The side

162

chain of D22 interacts with N6, while the backbone nitrogen atom of I23 interacts with N1, in a

163

very similar fashion to the SARS-CoV macrodomain (6). This aspartic acid is known to be

164

critical for ADP-ribose binding for alphavirus macrodomains (26, 27). A large number of

165

contacts are made in the highly conserved loop between β3 and α2 which includes many highly-

166

conserved residues, including a GGG (motif) and N40, which is completely conserved in all

167

enzymatically active macrodomains (33). N40 is positioned to make hydrogen bonds with the 3’

168

OH groups of the distal ribose, as well as a conserved water molecule (Fig. 3B-C). K44 and G46

169

also make hydrogen bonds with the 2’ OH of the distal ribose, G48 makes contact with the 1’

9

170

OH and a water that resides near the catalytic site, while the backbone nitrogen atom of V49

171

hydrogen bonds with the α-phosphate. The other major interactions with ADP-ribose occur in

172

another highly conserved region consisting of residues G130, I131, and F132 that are in the loop

173

between β6 and α5 (Fig. 3B). The α-phosphate accepts a hydrogen bond from the nitrogen atom

174

of I131, while the β-phosphate accepts hydrogen bonds from the backbone nitrogen atom of

175

G130 and F132. The phenyl ring of F132 may make van der Waals interactions with the distal

176

ribose to stabilize it, which may contribute to binding and hydrolysis (34). Loops β3-α2 and β6-

177

α5 are connected by an isoleucine bridge that forms a narrow channel around the diphosphate

178

which helps position the terminal ribose for water-mediated catalysis (6). Of all these residues, is

179

not exactly clear which ones are important for ADP-ribose binding, hydrolysis, or both.

180

Additionally, a network of direct contacts of ADP-ribose to solvent along with water mediated

181

contacts to the protein are shown (Fig. 3C).

182

Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with other CoV macrodomain structures. We

183

next sought to compare the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 to other deposited structures of this protein.

184

Superposition with Apo (6WEN) and ADP-ribose complexed protein (6W02) yielded RMSD of

185

0.48 Å (168 residues) and 0.37 Å (165 residues), respectively, indicating a high degree of

186

similarity (Fig. S3A-B). Comparison of the ADP-ribose binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with

187

that of the apo structure (6WEN) revealed minor conformational differences in order to

188

accommodate ADP-ribose binding. The loop between β3 and α2 (H45-V49) undergoes a change

189

in conformation and the sidechain of F132 is moved out of the ADP-ribose binding site (Fig.

190

S3C). Our ADP-ribose bound structure is nearly identical to 6W02, except for slight deviations

191

in the β3-α2 loop and an altered conformation of F156, where the aryl ring of F156 is moved

192

closer to the adenine ring (Fig. S3 C-D). However, this is likely a result of crystal packing as

10

193

F156 adopts this conformation in each subunit and would likely clash with subunit residues

194

related by either crystallographic or non-crystallographic symmetry.

195

We next compared the ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structure with that of

196

SARS-CoV (PDB 2FAV) (6) and MERS-CoV (PDB 5HOL) (35) Mac1 proteins. Superposition

197

yielded RMSD deviations of 0.71 Å (166 residues) and 1.06 Å (161 residues) for 2FAV and

198

5HOL, respectively. Additionally, the ADP-ribose binding mode in the SARS-CoV and SARS-

199

CoV-2 structures almost perfectly superimposed (Fig. 4A-D). The conserved aspartic acid

200

residue (D22, SARS-CoV-2) that binds to adenine, is localized in a similar region in all 3

201

proteins although there are slight differences in the rotamers about the Cb-Cg bond. The angles

202

between the mean planes defined by the OD1, CG and OD2 atoms relative to SARS-CoV-2

203

Mac1 is 23.1o and 46.5o for the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 structures, respectively.

204

Another notable difference is that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 macrodomains have an

205

isoleucine (I23) following this aspartic acid while MERS-CoV has an alanine (A22). Conversely,

206

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mac1 have a valine instead of an isoleucine immediately

207

following the GGG motif (V49/I48). From these structures it appears that having two isoleucines

208

in this location would clash, and that lineage B and lineage C β-CoVs has evolved in unique

209

ways to create space in this pocket (Fig. 4D and data not shown). Despite these small differences

210

in local structure, the overall structure of CoV Mac1 domains remain remarkably conserved, and

211

indicates they likely have similar biochemical activities and biological functions.

212

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV bind to ADP-ribose with similar

213

affinities. To determine if the CoV macrodomains had any noticeable differences in their ability

214

to bind ADP-ribose, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which measures the

215

energy released or absorbed during a binding reaction. Macrodomain proteins from human

216

(Mdo2), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were purified (Fig. S1A) and tested for

217

their affinity to ADP-ribose. All CoV Mac1 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low micromolar

218

affinity (7-16 μM), while human Mdo2 bound with an affinity about 10-times stronger (~220

219

nM) (Fig. 5A-B). As a control we tested the ability of the MERS-CoV macrodomain to bind to

220

ATP, and only observed minimal binding with mM affinity (data not shown). At higher

221

concentrations, the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain caused a slightly endothermic reaction,

222

potentially the result of protein aggregation or a change in conformation (Fig. 5A). The MERS-

223

CoV Mac1 had a greater affinity for ADP-ribose than SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in the

224

ITC assay (Fig. 5A-B), however, our results found the differences between these macrodomain

225

proteins to be much closer than previously reported (9). As an alternate method to confirm ADP-

226

ribose binding, we conducted a thermal shift assay. All 4 macrodomains tested denatured at

227

higher temperatures with the addition of ADP-ribose (Fig. S4). We conclude that lineage B and

228

lineage C β-CoV Mac1 proteins bind to ADP-ribose with similar affinities.

229

CoV macrodomains are MAR-hydrolases. To examine the MAR-hydrolase activity of

230

CoV Mac1, we first tested the viability of using ADP-ribose binding reagents to detect

231

MARylated protein. Previously, radiolabeled NAD+ has been the primary method used to label

232

MARylated protein (16, 17). To create a MARylated substrate, the catalytic domain of the

233

PARP10 (GST-PARP10 CD) protein was incubated with NAD+, leading to its automodification.

234

PARP10 CD is a standard substrate that has been used extensively in the field to analyze the

235

activity of macrodomains (16, 18, 26, 27). PARP10 is highly upregulated upon CoV infection

236

(23, 36) and is known to primarily auto-MARylate itself on acidic residues, which are the targets

237

of the MacroD2 class of macrodomains (27). We then tested a panel of anti-MAR, anti-PAR, or

238

PARP10 by immunoblot. The anti-MAR and anti-MAR/PAR binding reagents, but not anti-PAR

240

antibody, bound to MARylated PARP10 (Fig. S5). Therefore, in this work we utilized the anti-

241

MAR binding reagent to detect MARylated PARP10.

242

We next tested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 to remove ADP-ribose from

243

MARylated PARP10. SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 and MARylated PARP10 were incubated at

244

equimolar amounts of protein at 37oC and the reaction was stopped at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 or 60

245

minutes (Fig. 6A). As a control, MARylated PARP10 was incubated alone at 37oC and collected

246

at similar time points (Fig. 6A and Fig. S6). Each reaction had equivalent amounts of

247

MARylated PARP10 and Mac1 which was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6A). An

248

immediate reduction of more than 50% band intensity was observed within five minutes, and the

249

ADP-ribose modification was nearly completely removed by SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 within 30

250

minutes (Fig. 6A). The MARylated PAPR10 bands intensities were calculated, plotted, and were

251

fit using non-linear regression (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1

252

protein is a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase enzyme.

253

Next, we compared the MAR-hydrolase activity of Mac1 proteins from SARS-CoV-2,

254

SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV and human (i.e., Mdo2). Specifically, we monitored the time-

255

dependent loss of substrate using immunoblotting (Fig. 6C) under equimolar (i.e., 1 μM

256

[Mac1]:1 μM [substrate]) and multiple-turnover conditions (i.e., 0.5 μM [substrate]:0.1 μM

257

[Mac1] and 1.0 μM [substrate]:0.1 μM [Mac1] ), with total protein amounts confirmed by

258

Coomassie blue staining (Fig. S7). The resulting substrate decay plots (Fig. 6D) were fit using

259

non-linear regression to determine the initial rate (k) of substrate decay. Our results indicate that

260

the three CoV Mac1 proteins give rise to similar, but not identical, values of k (Fig. 6D). The

261

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein has a greater k than the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins,

262

especially under multiple-turnover conditions, and all 3 viral macrodomains gave rise to a more

263

rapid loss of substrate than the human Mdo2 enzyme (Fig. 6F). However, further enzymatic

264

analyses of these proteins are warranted to more thoroughly understand their kinetics and

265

binding affinities associated with various MARylated substrates.

266

CoV Mac1 proteins do not hydrolyze PAR. To determine if the CoV Mac1 proteins

267

could remove PAR from proteins, we incubated these proteins with an auto-PARylated PARP1

268

protein. PARP1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of NAD+ to create a range of

269

modification levels (Fig. S8). We incubated both partially and heavily modified PARP1 with all

270

four macrodomains and PARG as a positive control for 1 hour. While PARG completely

271

removed PAR, none of the macrodomain proteins removed PAR chains from PARP1 (Fig. 7).

272

We conclude that macrodomain proteins are unable to remove PAR from an automodified

273

PARP1 protein under these conditions.

274

ELISA assays can be used to measure ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of

275

macrodomains. Gel based assays as described above suffer from significant limitations in the

276

number of samples that can be done at once. A higher throughput assay will be needed to more

277

thoroughly investigate the activity of these enzymes and to screen for inhibitor compounds.

278

Based on the success of our antibody-based detection of MAR, we developed an ELISA assay

279

that has a similar ability to detect de-MARylation as our gel-based assay, but with the ability to

280

do so in a higher throughput manner (Fig. 8A). First, MARylated PARP10 was added to ELISA

281

plates. Next, the wells were washed and then incubated with different concentrations of the

282

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein for 60 min. After incubation, the wells were washed and treated with

283

anti-MAR binding reagent, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and the detection

284

reagent. As controls, we detected MARylated and non-MARylated PARP10 proteins bound to

286

corresponding secondary antibodies (Fig. 8B). SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 was able to remove MAR

287

signal in a dose-dependent manner and plotted to a linear non-regression fitted line (Fig. 8C).

288

Based on these results, we believe that this ELISA assay will be a useful tool for screening

289

potential inhibitors of macrodomain proteins.

291

DISCUSSION
Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 and its enzyme activity in

292

vitro. Structurally, it has a conserved three-layered α/β/α fold typical of the MacroD family of

293

macrodomains, and is extremely similar to other CoV Mac1 proteins (Fig. 2-4). The conserved

294

CoV macrodomain (Mac1) was initially described as an ADP-ribose-1”-phosphatase (ADRP), as

295

it was shown to be structurally similar to yeast enzymes that have this enzymatic activity (37).

296

Early biochemical studies confirmed this activity for CoV Mac1, though its phosphatase activity

297

for ADP-ribose-1”-phosphate was rather modest (6-8). Later, it was shown that mammalian

298

macrodomain proteins could remove ADP-ribose from protein substrates, indicating protein de-

299

ADP-ribosylation as a more likely function for the viral macrodomains (33, 38, 39). Shortly

300

thereafter, the SARS-CoV, hCoV-229E, FIPV, several alphavirus, and the hepatitis E virus

301

macrodomains were demonstrated to have de-ADP-ribosylating activity (16-18). However, this

302

activity has not yet been reported for the MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein.

303

In this study, we show that the Mac1 proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-

304

CoV-2 hydrolyze MAR from a protein substrate (Fig. 6). Their enzymatic activities were similar

305

despite sequence divergence of almost 60% between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. However,

306

the initial rate associated with the loss of substrate was largest for the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1

307

protein, particularly under multiple-turnover conditions. It is unclear what structural or sequence

308

differences may account for the increased activity of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein under these

309

conditions, especially considering the pronounced structurally similarities between these

310

proteins, specifically the SARS-CoV Mac1 (0.71 Å RMSD). It is also unclear if these differences

311

would matter in the context of the virus infection, as the relative concentrations of Mac1 and its

312

substrate during infection is not known. We also compared these activities to the human Mdo2

16

313

macrodomain. Mdo2 had a greater affinity for ADP-ribose than the viral enzymes, but had

314

significantly reduced enzyme activity in our experiments. Due to its high affinity for ADP-

315

ribose, it is possible that the Mdo2 protein was partially inhibited by rebinding to the MAR

316

product in these assays. Regardless, these results suggest that the human and viral proteins likely

317

have structural differences that alter their biochemical activities in vitro, indicating that it may be

318

possible to create viral macrodomain inhibitors that don’t impact the human macrodomains. We

319

also compared the ability of these macrodomain proteins to hydrolyze PAR. None of the

320

macrodomains were able to hydrolyze either partially or heavily modified PARP1, further

321

demonstrating that the primary enzymatic activity of these proteins is to hydrolyze MAR (Fig.

322

7).

323

When analyzing viral macrodomain sequences, it is clear that they have at least 3 highly

324

conserved regions (Fig. 1B)(24). The first region includes the NAAN (37-40) and GGG (residues

325

46-48) motifs in the loop between β3 and α2. The second domain includes a GIF (residues 130-

326

132) motif in the loop between β6 and α5. The final conserved region is a VGP (residues 96-98)

327

motif at the end of β5 and extends into the loop between β5 and α4. Both of the first two

328

domains have well defined interactions with ADP-ribose (Fig. 3). However, no one has

329

addressed the role of the VGP residues, though our structure indicates that the glycine may

330

interact with a water molecule that makes contact with the β-phosphate. Identifying residues that

331

directly contribute to ADP-ribose binding, hydrolysis, or both by CoV Mac1 proteins will be

332

critical to determining the specific roles of ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis in CoV

333

replication and pathogenesis.

334
335

While all previous studies of macrodomain de-ADP-ribosylation have primarily used
radiolabeled substrate, we obtained highly repeatable and robust data utilizing ADP-ribose

336

binding reagents designed to specifically recognize MAR (40, 41). The use of these binding

337

reagents should enhance the feasibility of this assay for many labs that are not equipped for

338

radioactive work. Utilizing these binding reagents, we further developed an ELISA assay for de-

339

MARylation that has the ability to dramatically increase the number of samples that can be

340

analyzed compared to the gel-based assay. To our knowledge, previously developed ELISA

341

assays were used to measure ADP-ribosyltransferase activities (42) but no ELISA has been

342

established to test the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of macrodomain proteins. This ELISA

343

assay should be useful to those in the field to screen compounds for macrodomain inhibitors that

344

could be either valuable research tools or potential therapeutics.

345

The functional importance of the CoV Mac1 domain has been demonstrated in several

346

reports, mostly utilizing the mutation of a highly conserved asparagine that mediates contact with

347

the distal ribose (Fig. 3B) (18, 21, 22). However, the physiological relevance of Mac1 during

348

SARS-CoV-2 infection has yet to be determined. In addition, the proteins that are targeted by the

349

CoV Mac1 for de-ADP-ribosylation remains unknown. Unfortunately, there are no known

350

compounds that inhibit this domain that could help identify the functions of this protein during

351

infection. The outbreak of COVID-19 has illustrated an urgent need for developing multiple

352

therapeutic drugs targeting conserved coronavirus proteins. Mac1 appears to be an ideal

353

candidate for further drug development based on: i) its highly conserved structure and

354

biochemical activities within CoVs; and ii) its importance for multiple CoVs to cause disease.

355

Targeting Mac1 may also have the benefit of enhancing the innate immune response, as we have

356

shown that Mac1 is required for some CoVs to block IFN production (18, 23). Considering that

357

Mac1 proteins from divergent αCoVs such as 229E and FIPV also have de-ADP-ribosylating

358

activity (16, 17), it is possible that compounds targeting Mac1 could prevent disease caused by

359

of wide variety of CoV, including those of veterinary importance like porcine epidemic diarrhea

360

virus (PEDV). Additionally, compounds that inhibit Mac1 in combination with the structure

361

could help identify the mechanisms it uses to bind to its biologically relevant protein substrates,

362

remove ADP-ribose from these proteins, and potentially define the precise function for Mac1 in

363

SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In conclusion, the results described here will be

364

critical for the design and development of highly-specific Mac1 inhibitors that could be used

365

therapeutically to mitigate COVID-19 or future CoV outbreaks.

METHODS

368

Plasmids

369

The SARS-CoV macrodomain (Mac1) (residues 1000-1172 of pp1a) was cloned into the

370

pET21a+ expression vector with an N-terminal His tag. The MERS-CoV Mac1 (residues 1110-

371

1273 of pp1a) was also cloned into pET21a+ with a C-terminal His tag. SARS-CoV-2 Mac1

372

(residues 1023-1197 of pp1a) was cloned into the pET30a+ expression vector with an N-terminal

373

His tag and a TEV cleavage site (Synbio). The pETM-CN Mdo2 Mac1 (residues 7-243)

374

expression vector with an N-terminal His-TEV-V5 tag and the pGEX4T-PARP10-CD (residues

375

818-1025) expression vector with an N-terminal GST tag were previously described (33). All

376

plasmids were confirmed by restriction digest, PCR, and direct sequencing.

377

Protein Expression and Purification

378

A single colony of E. coli cells (C41(DE3)) containing plasmids harboring the constructs

379

of the macrodomain proteins was inoculated into 10 mL LB media and grown overnight at 37°C

380

with shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight culture was transferred to a shaker flask containing 2X

381

1L TB media at 37oC until the OD600 reached 0.7. The proteins were either induced with 0.4

382

mM IPTG at 37oC for 3 hours, or 17°C for 20 hours. Cells were pelleted at 3500 × g for 10 min

383

and frozen at -80°C. Frozen cells were thawed at room temperature, resuspended in 50 mM Tris

384

(pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, and sonicated using the following cycle parameters: Amplitude: 50%,

385

Pulse length: 30 seconds, Number of pulses: 12, while incubating on ice for >1min between

386

pulses. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifuging the cell lysate at 45,450 × g for 30

387

minutes at 4°C. The expressed soluble proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using

388

a 5 ml prepacked HisTrap HP column on an AKTA Pure protein purification system (GE

389

Healthcare). The fractions were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a

390

Superdex 75 10/300 GL column equilibrated with 20mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and the

391

protein sized as a monomer relative to the column calibration standards. To cleave off the His tag

392

from the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, purified TEV protease was added to purified SARS-CoV-2 Mac1

393

protein at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w), and then passed back through the Ni-NTA HP column. Protein

394

was collected in the flow through and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl.

395

The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, free from the N-terminal 6X-His tag, was used for subsequent

396

crystallization experiments.

397

For the PARP10-CD protein, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH

398

8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and sonicated as described above.

399

The cell lysate was incubated with 10 ml of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin from GE Healthcare,

400

equilibrated with the same buffer for 2 hours, then applied to a gravity flow column to allow

401

unbound proteins to flow through. The column was washed with the resuspension buffer till the

402

absorbance at 280 nm reached baseline. The bound protein was eluted out of the column with

403

resuspension buffer containing 20 mM reduced glutathione and then dialyzed back into the

404

resuspension buffer overnight at 4°C.

405

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

406

All ITC titrations were performed on a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC instrument (Malvern

407

Pananalytical Inc., MA). All reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl

408

using 100 μM of all macrodomain proteins at 25°C. Titration of 2 mM ADP-ribose or ATP

409

(MilliporeSigma) contained in the stirring syringe included a single 0.4 μL injection, followed by

410

18 consecutive injections of 2 μL. Data analysis of thermograms was analyzed using one set of

411

binding sites model of the MicroCal ITC software to obtain all fitting model parameters for the

412

experiments.

Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF)

414

Thermal shift assay with DSF involved use of LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche

415

Diagnostics). In total, a 15 μL mixture containing 8X SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen), and 10 μM

416

macrodomain protein in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, NaOH, pH 7.5 and various

417

concentrations of ADP-ribose were mixed on ice in 384-well PCR plate (Roche). Fluorescent

418

signals were measured from 25 to 95 °C in 0.2 °C/30-s steps (excitation, 470-505 nm; detection,

419

540-700 nm). The main measurements were carried out in triplicate. Data evaluation and Tm

420

determination involved use of the Roche LightCycler® 480 Protein Melting Analysis software,

421

and data fitting calculations involved the use of single site binding curve analysis on Graphpad

MAR Hydrolase Assays

424

Automodification of PARP10-CD protein: A 10 μM solution of purified PAPR10-CD

425

protein was incubated for 20 minutes at 37oC with 1 mM final concentration of β-Nicotinamide

426

Adenine Dinucleotide (β NAD+) (Millipore-Sigma) in a reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150

427

mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, and 0.02% NP-40). MARylated PARP10 was aliquoted and stored at -

running buffer. For direct protein detection, the SDS-PAGE gel was stained using InstantBlue®

437

Protein Stain (Expedeon). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were transferred onto

438

polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using iBlot™ 2 Dry Blotting System

439

(ThermoFisher Scientific). The blot was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05%

440

Tween-20 and probed with anti-mono or poly ADP-ribose binding reagents/antibodies

441

MABE1076 (α-MAR), MABC547 (α-PAR), MABE1075 (α-MAR/PAR) (Millipore-Sigma) and

442

anti-GST tag monoclonal antibody MA4-004 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The primary antibodies

443

were detected with secondary infrared anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (LI-COR

444

Biosciences). All immunoblots were visualized using Odyssey® CLx Imaging System (LI-COR

445

Biosciences). The images were quantitated using Image J (National Institutes for Health (NIH))

446

or Image Studio software.

Kinetic analysis of ADP-ribose hydrolysis: To quantify the initial rate (k) of substrate

448

decay associated with the four macrodomains, each data set represented in the substrate decay

449

immunoblots in Fig. 6C, were fitted to a decaying exponential with the following functional

450

form: ([S]initial-[S]final)e (-[k/[S]initial)t]+[S]final (Mathematica 12, Wolfram Alpha). The decay plots

and incubated with 50 μL of 100 nM automodified MARylated PARP10-CD in PBS for one

456

hour under room temperature. Following four washes with PBS-T, variable concentrations of

457

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 were incubated with MARylated PARP10-CD for 60 minutes at 37oC.

addition to MARylated PARP10-CD. Subsequently, ELISA wells were washed four times with

460

PBS-T and incubated with 50 µL/well of anti-GST (Invitrogen MA4-004) or anti-MAR

461

(Millipore-Sigma MAB1076) diluted 1:5,000 in 5 mg/ml BSA in PBS-T (BSA5-PBS-T) for 1

462

hour at room temperature. After four additional washes with PBS-T, each well was incubated

463

with 50 μL diluted 1:5,000 in BSA5-PBS-T of anti-rabbit-HRP (SouthernBiotech, USA) or anti-

464

mouse-HRP (Rockland Immunochemicals, USA) conjugate for 1 hour at room temperature. The

465

plate was washed four times with PBS-T and 100 μL of TMB peroxidase substrate solution

466

(SouthernBiotech, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. The peroxidase

467

reaction was stopped with 50 μL per well of 1 M HCl before proceeding to reading. Absorbance

468

was measured at 450 nm and subtracted from 620 nm using Biotek Powerwave XS plate reader

469

(BioTek). As controls, MARylated PARP10-CD and non-MARylated PARP10 were detected

detected with anti-MAR antibody was used to establish the background signal. The % signal

472

remaining was calculated by dividing the experimental signal (+ enzyme) minus background by

473

the control (no enzyme) minus the background.

automodified with 500 μM NAD+ were used as substrates for the de-PARylation assays.

483

Recombinant macrodomain protein (1 μg) was supplemented to the reaction buffer (100 mM

484

Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 10 mM DTT) containing automodified PARP1 and

485

incubated for 1 hour at 37oC. Recombinant PARG (1 μg) was used as a positive control for PAR

erasing (44). Reaction mixtures were resolved on 4–12% Criterion™ XT Bis-Tris protein gels,

487

transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the anti-PAR polyclonal antibody 96-

Structure Determination

490

Crystallization and Data Collection: Purified SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in 150 mM NaCl, 20

491

mM Tris pH 8.0 was concentrated to 13.8 mg/mL for crystallization screening. All crystallization

492

experiments were setup using an NT8 drop-setting robot (Formulatrix Inc.) and UVXPO MRC

493

(Molecular Dimensions) sitting drop vapor diffusion plates at 18°C. 100 nL of protein and 100

494

nL crystallization solution were dispensed and equilibrated against 50 μL of the latter. The

495

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 complex with ADP-ribose was prepared by adding the ligand, from a 100

496

mM stock in water, to the protein at a final concentration of 2 mM. Crystals that were obtained in

497

1-2 days from the Salt Rx HT screen (Hampton Research) condition E10 (1.8 M

498

NaH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 8.2). Refinement screening was conducted using the additive screen HT

499

(Hampton Research) by supplementing 10% of each additive to the Salt Rx HT E10 condition in

500

a new 96-well UVXPO crystallization plate. The crystals used for data collection were obtained

501

from Salt Rx HT E10 supplemented with 0.1 M NDSB-256 from the additive screen (Fig. S1).

502

Samples were transferred to a fresh drop composed of 80% crystallization solution and 20%

503

(v/v) PEG 200 and stored in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the

505

detector.

506

Structure Solution and Refinement: Intensities were integrated using XDS (45, 46) via

507

Autoproc (47) and the Laue class analysis and data scaling were performed with Aimless (48).

508

Notably, a pseudo-translational symmetry peak was observed at (0, 0.31 0.5) that was 44.6% of

509

the origin. Structure solution was conducted by molecular replacement with Phaser (49) using a

510

previously determined structure of ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 (PDB 6W02) as the

511

search model. The top solution was obtained in the space group P21 with four molecules in the

512

asymmetric unit. Structure refinement and manual model building were conducted with Phenix

513

(50) and Coot (51) respectively. Disordered side chains were truncated to the point for which

514

electron density could be observed. Structure validation was conducted with Molprobity (52) and

515

figures were prepared using the CCP4MG package (53). Superposition of the macrodomain

516

structures was conducted with GESAMT (54).

517

Statistical Analysis

518

All statistical analyses were done using an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test to assess

519

differences in mean values between groups, and graphs are expressed as mean ±SD. Significant p

520

values are denoted with *p≤0.05.

ACCESSION CODES

522

The coordinates and structure factors for SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 were deposited to the
