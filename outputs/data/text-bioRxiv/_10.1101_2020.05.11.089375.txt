ABSTRACT

24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-like-CoVs

25

encode 3 tandem macrodomains within non-structural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain,

26

Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from

27

target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a

28

posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is

29

essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a

30

virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-

31

CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1

32

exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low μM affinities. In

33

contrast, we found that only the MERS-CoV Mac1 protein bound to poly-ADP-ribose (PAR),

34

and none of these enzymes could hydrolyze PAR. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting

35

antibodies and both gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated highly efficient

36

de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and

37

other CoV Mac1 proteins are highly efficient MAR-hydrolases with strikingly similar activity,

38

indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.

IMPORTANCE

41

SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide

42

pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused nearly 350 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no

43

currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All

44

coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes

45

ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly

46

recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for

47

CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry

48

and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of

49

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and

50

hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These

51

results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this

52

unique protein domain.

INTRODUCTION
The recently emerged pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus

56

named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). As of May 28,

57

2020, this virus has been responsible for ~ 5.7 million cases of COVID-19 and >350,000 deaths

58

worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the lineage B β-CoVs with overall high sequence

59

similarity with other SARS-like CoVs, including SARS-CoV. While most of the genome is

60

>80% similar with SARS-CoV, there are regions where amino acid conservation is significantly

61

lower. As expected, the most divergent proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome from SARS-CoV

62

include the Spike glycoprotein and several accessory proteins including 8a (absent), 8b

63

(extended), and 3b (truncated). However, somewhat unexpectedly, several non-structural

64

proteins also show significant divergence from SARS-CoV, including non-structural proteins 3,

65

4, and 7, which could affect the biology of SARS-CoV-2 (3, 4).

66

Coronaviruses encode 16 non-structural proteins that are translated from two open

67

reading frames (ORFs), replicase 1a and 1ab (rep1a and rep1ab) (5). The largest non-structural

68

protein is the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) that encodes for multiple modular protein domains.

69

These domains in SARS-CoV-2 diverge in amino acid sequence from SARS-CoV as much as

70

30%, and SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 includes a large insertion of 25-41 residues just upstream of the

71

first of three tandem macrodomains (Mac1, Mac2, and Mac3) (Fig. 1A) (3). In addition to this

72

insertion, the individual macrodomains show large amounts of amino acid divergence. Mac1

73

diverges 28% from SARS-CoV and 59% from MERS-CoV, while Mac2 and Mac3 diverge 24%

74

from SARS-CoV. It is feasible that these significant sequence differences could impact the

75

unique biology of SARS-CoV-2. However, macrodomains have a highly conserved structure,

76

and thus sequence divergence may have little impact on their overall function. Mac1 is present in

77

all CoVs, unlike Mac2 and Mac3, and early structural and biochemical data demonstrated that it

78

contains a conserved three-layered α/β/α fold and binds to mono-ADP-ribose (MAR), poly-ADP-

79

ribose (PAR), and other related molecules (6-10). ADP-ribose is buried in a hydrophobic cleft

80

where the ADP-ribose binds to several highly-conserved residues such as aspartic acid at

81

position 23 (D23) and asparagine at position 41 (N41) of SARS-CoV (6). Mac1 homologs are

82

also found in alphaviruses, Hepatitis E virus, and Rubella virus, and structural analysis of these

83

macrodomains have demonstrated that they are very similar to CoV Mac1 (11, 12). All are

84

members of the larger MacroD-type macrodomain family, which includes human macrodomains

85

Mdo1 and Mdo2 (13).

86

The CoV Mac1 was originally named ADP-ribose-1”-phosphatase (ADRP) based on data

87

demonstrating that it could remove the phosphate group from ADP-ribose-1”-phosphate (6-8).

88

However, the activity was rather modest, and it was unclear why this would impact a virus

89

infection. More recently it has been demonstrated that CoV Mac1 can hydrolyze the bond

90

between amino acid chains and ADP-ribose molecules (14-16), indicating that it can reverse

91

protein ADP-ribosylation (6, 8). ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification catalyzed

92

by ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs, also known as PARPs) through transferring an ADP-ribose

93

moiety from NAD+ onto target proteins (17). The ADP-ribose is transferred as a single units of

94

MAR, or single units of MAR are transferred consecutively to form a PAR chain. CoV Mac1

95

proteins hydrolyze MAR, but have minimal activity against PAR (14, 15). Several MARylating

96

PARPs are induced by interferon (IFN) and are known to inhibit virus replication, implicating

97

MARylation in the host-response to infection (18).

98
99

Several reports have addressed the role of Mac1 on the replication and pathogenesis of
CoVs, mostly using the mutation of a highly conserved asparagine to alanine. This mutation

5

100

abolished the MAR-hydrolase activity of SARS-CoV Mac1 (16). This mutation has minimal

101

effects on CoV replication in transformed cells, but reduces viral load, leads to enhanced IFN

102

production, and strongly attenuates both Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV in

103

mouse models of infection (7, 16, 19, 20). MHV Mac1 was also required for efficient replication

104

in primary macrophages, which could be partially rescued by the PARP inhibitors XAV-939 and

105

3-AB or siRNA knockdown of PARP12 or PARP14 (21). These data suggest that Mac1’s likely

106

function is to counter PARP-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation (22). Mutations in the

107

alphavirus and HEV macrodomain also have substantial phenotypic effects on virus replication

108

and pathogenesis (14, 23-26). As viral macrodomains are clearly important virulence factors,

109

they are considered to be potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics (22).

110

Based on the close structural similarities between viral macrodomains, we hypothesized

111

that SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 has similar binding and hydrolysis activity as other CoV Mac1

112

enzymes. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein

113

bound to ADP-ribose. Binding to MAR and PAR was tested and directly compared to a human

114

macrodomain (Mdo2) and the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins by several in vitro

115

assays. All CoV Mac1 proteins bound to MAR with similar affinity, but only the MERS-CoV

116

Mac1 could bind to PAR. Finally, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-

117

CoV Mac1 proteins could efficiently remove MAR from a protein substrate, but did not remove

118

PAR. These results indicate very similar function for CoV Mac1 proteins, and will be

119

instrumental in the design and testing of novel therapeutic agents targeting the CoV Mac1

120

protein domain.

RESULTS

123

Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 complexed with ADP-ribose. To create recombinant

124

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 for structure determination and enzyme assays, nucleotides 3348-3872 of

125

SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-hu-1 (accession number NC_045512), representing amino acids

126

I1023-K1197 of rep1a, were cloned into a bacterial expression vector containing an N-terminal

127

6X-His tag and TEV cleavage site. We obtained large amounts (>100 mg) of purified

128

recombinant protein (Fig. S1A). A small amount of this protein was digested by the TEV

129

protease to obtain protein devoid of any extra tags for crystallization and used to obtain crystals

130

from which the structure was determined (Fig. S1B). Our crystallization experiments resulted in

131

the same crystal form (needle clusters) from several conditions, but only when ADP-ribose was

132

added to the protein. This represents an additional crystal form (P21) amongst the recently

133

determined SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain structures (27-29).

134

The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 complexed with ADP-ribose was obtained using X-

135

ray diffraction data to 2.2 Å resolution and contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit that

136

were nearly identical. The polypeptide chains could be traced from V3-M171 for subunits A/C

137

and V3-K172 for subunits B/D. Superposition of subunits B-D onto subunit A (169 residues

138

aligned) yielded RMSD deviations of 0.17 Å, 0.17 Å and 0.18 Å respectively between Cα atoms.

139

As such, subunit A was used for the majority of the structure analysis described herein. The

140

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein adopted a fold consistent with the MacroD subfamily of

141

macrodomains that contains a core composed of a mixed arrangement of 7 β-sheets (parallel and

142

antiparallel) that are flanked by 6 α-helices (Fig. 2A-B).

143
144

As mentioned above, apo crystals were never observed for our construct, though the apo
structure has been solved by researchers at The Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious

145

Diseases (PDB 6WEN) (28) and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (PDB 6WEY) (27).

146

Further analysis of the amino acid sequences used for expression and purification revealed that

147

our construct had 5 additional residues at the C-terminus (MKSEK) and differs slightly at the N-

148

terminus as well (GIE vs GE) relative to 6WEN. In addition, the sequence used to obtain the

149

structure of 6WEY is slightly shorter than SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 at both the N and C-terminal

150

regions (Fig. S2A). To assess the effect of these additional residues on crystallization, chain B

151

of the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, which was traced to residue K172, was superimposed onto subunit A

152

of PDB 6W02 (29), a previously determined structure of ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1.

153

Analysis of the crystal packing of 6W02 indicates that the additional residues at the C-terminus

154

would clash with symmetry related molecules (Fig. S2B). This suggests that the presence of

155

these extra residues at the C-terminus likely prevented the generation of the more tightly packed

156

crystal forms obtained for 6W02 and 6WEY, which diffracted to high resolution.

157

The ADP-ribose binding pocket contained large regions of positive electron density

158

consistent with ADP-ribose molecules (Fig. 3A). The adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with

159

D22-I23, which makes up a small loop between β2 and the N-terminal half of α1. The side chain

160

of D22 interacts with N6, while the backbone nitrogen atom of I23 interacts with N1, in a very

161

similar fashion to the SARS-CoV macrodomain (6). A large number of contacts are made in the

162

loop between β3 and α2 which includes many highly-conserved residues, including a GGG

163

(motif) and N40, which is completely conserved in all enzymatically active macrodomains (30).

164

N40 is positioned to make hydrogen bonds with the 3’ OH groups of the distal ribose, as well as

165

a conserved water molecule. K44 and G46 also make hydrogen bonds with the 2’ OH of the

166

distal ribose, G48 makes contact with the 1’ OH and a water that resides near the catalytic site,

167

while the backbone nitrogen atom of V49 hydrogen bonds with the α-phosphate. The other major

168

interactions with ADP-ribose occur in residues G130, I131, and F132 that are in the loop

169

between β6 and α5 (Fig. 3B). The α-phosphate accepts a hydrogen bond from the nitrogen atom

170

of I131, while the β-phosphate accepts hydrogen bonds from the backbone nitrogen atom of

171

G130 and F132. Loops β3-α2 and β6-α5 are connected by an isoleucine bridge that forms a

172

narrow channel around the diphosphate which helps position the terminal ribose for water-

173

mediated catalysis (6). Additionally, a network of direct contacts of ADP-ribose to solvent along

174

with water mediated contacts to the protein are shown (Fig. 3C).

175

Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with other CoV macrodomain structures. We

176

next sought to compare the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 to other deposited structures of this protein.

177

Superposition with Apo (6WEN) and ADP-ribose complexed protein (6W02) yielded RMSD of

178

0.48 Å (168 residues) and 0.37 Å (165 residues), respectively, indicating a high degree of

179

similarity (Fig. S3A-B). Comparison of the ADP-ribose binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with

180

that of the apo structure (6WEN) revealed minor conformational differences in order to

181

accommodate ADP-ribose binding. The loop between β3 and α2 (H45-V49) undergoes a change

182

in conformation and the sidechain of F132 is moved out of the ADP-ribose binding site (Fig.

183

S3C). Our ADP-ribose bound structure is nearly identical to 6W02, except for slight deviations

184

in the β3-α2 loop and an altered conformation of F156, where the aryl ring of F156 is moved

185

closer to the adenine ring (Fig. S3 C-D). However, this is likely a result of crystal packing as

186

F156 adopts this conformation in each subunit and would likely clash with subunit residues

187

related by either crystallographic or non-crystallographic symmetry.

188

We next compared the ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structure with that of

189

SARS-CoV (PDB 2FAV) (6) and MERS-CoV (PDB 5HOL) (31) Mac1 proteins. Superposition

190

yielded RMSD deviations of 0.71 Å (166 residues) and 1.06 Å (161 residues) for 2FAV and

9

191

5HOL, respectively. Additionally, the ADP-ribose binding mode in the SARS-CoV and SARS-

192

CoV-2 structures almost perfectly superimposed (Fig. 4A-D). The conserved aspartic acid

193

residue (D22, SARS-CoV-2) that binds to adenine, are localized in a similar region although

194

there are slight differences in the rotamers about the Cb-Cg bond. The angles between the mean

195

planes defined by the OD1, CG and OD2 atoms relative to SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 is 23.1o and

196

46.5o for the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 structures, respectively. Another notable

197

difference is that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 macrodomains have an isoleucine (I23)

198

following this aspartic acid while MERS-CoV has an alanine (A22). Conversely, SARS-CoV-2

199

and SARS-CoV Mac1 have a valine instead of an isoleucine immediately following the GGG

200

motif (V49/I48). From these structures it appears that having two isoleucines in this location

201

would clash, and that lineage B and lineage C β-CoVs has evolved in unique ways to create

202

space in this pocket (Fig. 4D and data not shown). Despite these small differences in local

203

structure, the overall structure of CoV Mac1 domains remain remarkably conserved, and

204

indicates they likely have similar biochemical activities and biological functions.

205

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV bind to ADP-ribose with similar

206

affinities. To determine if the CoV macrodomains had any noticeable differences in their ability

207

to bind ADP-ribose, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which measures the

208

energy released or absorbed during a binding reaction. Macrodomain proteins from human

209

(Mdo2), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were purified (Fig. S1A) and tested for

210

their affinity to ADP-ribose. All CoV Mac1 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low micromolar

211

affinity (7-16 μM), while human Mdo2 bound with an affinity about 10-times stronger (~220

212

nM) (Fig. 5A-B). As a control we tested the ability of the MERS-CoV macrodomain to bind to

213

ATP, and only observed minimal binding with mM affinity (data not shown). At higher

10

214

concentrations, the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain caused a slightly endothermic reaction,

215

potentially the result of protein aggregation or a change in conformation (Fig. 5A). The MERS-

216

CoV Mac1 had a greater affinity for ADP-ribose than SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in the

217

ITC assay (Fig. 5A-B), however, our results found the differences between these macrodomain

218

proteins to be much closer than previously reported (9). As an alternate method to confirm ADP-

219

ribose binding, we conducted a thermal shift assay. All 4 macrodomains tested denatured at

220

higher temperatures with the addition of ADP-ribose (Fig. S4). We then tested the ability of the

221

CoV Mac1 proteins to bind to PAR using a PAR overlay assay. Macrodomain proteins were slot-

222

blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and were then incubated with purified PAR. PAR

223

binding was then detected with 2 distinct anti-PAR antibodies (Fig. 5C). Histone H1, which

224

binds very efficiently to PAR, and DNaseI were used as positive and negative controls,

225

respectively, as described previously (32). This assay showed that Mdo2 and MERS-CoV Mac1

226

could bind to PAR, in contrast to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, which were unable to bind

227

PAR. Importantly, only 1 pmol of Histone H1 was needed to bind to PAR, while 60 pmol of the

228

macrodomain proteins were used to detect PAR binding. We conclude that lineage B and lineage

229

C β-CoV Mac1 proteins bind to ADP-ribose with similar affinities, but demonstrate unique

230

differences in their ability to bind PAR.

231

CoV macrodomains are highly efficient MAR-hydrolases. To examine the MAR-

232

hydrolase activity of CoV Mac1, we first tested the viability of using antibodies to detect

233

MARylated protein. Previously, radiolabeled NAD+ has been the primary method used to label

234

MARylated protein (14, 15). To create a MARylated substrate, the catalytic domain of the

235

PARP10 (GST-PARP10 CD) protein was incubated with NAD+, leading to its automodification.

236

We then tested a panel of monoclonal antibodies that detect MAR, PAR, or both MAR and PAR

237

for the ability to detect MARylated PARP10. The anti-MAR and anti-MAR/PAR antibodies, but

238

not anti-PAR antibody, bound to MARylated PARP10 (Fig. S5). From herein we utilized the

239

anti-MAR antibody to detect MARylated PARP10.

240

We next tested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 to remove ADP-ribose from

241

MARylated PARP10. SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 and MARylated PARP10 were incubated at

242

equimolar amounts of protein at 37oC and the reaction was stopped at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 or 60

243

minutes (Fig. 6A). As a control, MARylated PARP10 was incubated alone for 60 minutes at

244

37oC. Each reaction had equivalent amounts of MARylated PARP10 and Mac1 which was

245

confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6A). An immediate reduction of more than 50%

246

band intensity was observed within five minutes, and the ADP-ribose modification was nearly

247

completely removed by SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 within 30 minutes (Fig. 6A). The MARylated

248

PAPR10 bands intensities were calculated, plotted, and fit to a non-linear regression curve (Fig.

249

6B). This result indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein is a highly efficient MAR-

250

hydrolase.

251

Next, we compared MAR-hydrolase activity of Mac1 from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,

252

and MERS-CoV and human Mdo2. These proteins were incubated with MARylated PARP10 as

253

described above and the removal of MAR was analyzed at 5, 15 and 30 minutes (Fig. 6C). MAR

254

was rapidly removed from MARylated PARP10 with the CoV Mac1 proteins (Fig. 6D).

255

Approximately 95% of MAR was removed by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 within 15

256

minutes, while at the same timepoint MERS-CoV Mac1 removed about 85% of MAR (Fig. 6D).

257

A more gradual decrease of MARylated PAPR10 band intensity was observed with Mdo2. It

258

removed approximately 70% of MAR in 30 minutes, which was significantly different from both

259

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mac1. These data showed that CoV Mac1 proteins have similar

260

MAR-hydrolase activity against an auto-modified PARP10 protein, and they have increased

261

activity when compared to the human Mdo2 protein under these conditions. However, further

262

enzymatic analyses of these proteins are warranted to more thoroughly understand their kinetics

263

and affinities for various MARylated substrates.

264

CoV Mac1 proteins do not hydrolyze PAR. To determine if the CoV Mac1 proteins

265

could remove PAR from proteins, we incubated these proteins with an auto-PARylated PARP1

266

protein. PARP1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of NAD+ to create a range of

267

modification levels (Fig. S6). We incubated both partially and heavily modified PARP1 with all

268

four macrodomains and PARG as a positive control for 1 hour. While PARG completely

269

removed PAR, none of the macrodomain proteins removed PAR chains from PARP1 (Fig. 6E).

270

We conclude that macrodomain proteins are unable to remove PAR from an automodified

271

PARP1 protein under these conditions.

272

ELISA assays can be used to measure ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of

273

macrodomains. Gel based assays as described above suffer from significant limitations in the

274

number of samples that can be done at once. A higher throughput assay will be needed to more

275

thoroughly investigate the activity of these enzymes and to screen for inhibitor compounds.

276

Based on the success of our antibody-based detection of MAR, we developed an ELISA assay

277

that has a similar ability to detect de-MARylation as our gel-based assay, but with the ability to

278

do so in a higher throughput manner (Fig. 7A). First, MARylated PARP10 was added to ELISA

279

plates. Next, the wells were washed and then incubated with different concentrations of the

280

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein for 30 min. After incubation, the wells were washed and treated with

281

anti-MAR antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and the detection reagent.

282

As controls, we detected MARylated and non-MARylated PARP10 proteins bound to

283

glutathione plates with anti-GST and anti-MAR antibodies as primary and their corresponding

284

secondary antibodies (Fig. 7B). SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 was able to remove MAR signal in a dose-

285

dependent manner and fit to a non-linear regression curve (Fig. 7C). Based on these results, we

286

conclude that this ELISA assay will be a useful tool for screening potential inhibitors or defining

287

enzyme kinetics of macrodomain proteins.

DISCUSSION
Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 and its enzyme activity in

290

vitro. Structurally, it has a conserved three-layered α/β/α fold typical of the MacroD family of

291

macrodomains, and is extremely similar to other CoV Mac1 proteins (Fig. 2-4). The conserved

292

CoV macrodomain (Mac1) was initially described as an ADP-ribose-1”-phosphatase (ADRP), as

293

it was shown to be structurally similar to yeast enzymes that have this enzymatic activity (33).

294

Early biochemical studies confirmed this activity for CoV Mac1, though its phosphatase activity

295

for ADP-ribose-1”-phosphate was rather modest (6-8). Later, it was shown that mammalian

296

macrodomain proteins could remove ADP-ribose from protein substrates, indicating protein de-

297

ADP-ribosylation as a more likely function for the viral macrodomains (30, 34, 35). Shortly

298

thereafter, the SARS-CoV, hCoV-229E, FIPV, several alphavirus, and the hepatitis E virus

299

macrodomains were demonstrated to have de-ADP-ribosylating activity (14-16). However, this

300

activity has not yet been reported for the MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein.

301

In this study, we show that the Mac1 proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-

302

CoV-2 hydrolyze MAR from a protein substrate (Fig. 6). Their activities were similar despite

303

sequence divergence of almost 60% between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. We then compared

304

these activities to the human Mdo2 macrodomain. Mdo2 had a greater affinity for ADP-ribose

305

than the viral enzymes, but had significantly reduced enzyme activity in our experiments.

306

However, it’s possible that the Mdo2 and potentially the MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins were

307

partially inhibited by the released MAR in these assays due to their tighter binding to ADP-

308

ribose. Regardless, these results suggest that the human and viral enzymes likely have structural

309

differences that result in alterations in their biochemical activities in vitro.

310

We also compared the ability of these macrodomain proteins to bind and hydrolyze PAR.

311

None of the macrodomains were able to hydrolyze either partially or heavily modified PARP1,

312

further demonstrating that the primary enzyme activity of these proteins is to hydrolyze MAR

313

(Fig. 6E). Intriguingly, the Mdo2 and MERS-CoV macrodomain proteins bound to poly-ADP-

314

ribose, while the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins did not (Fig. 5C). It is unclear if this

315

binding is relevant during infection, as these proteins do not bind to PAR nearly as well as

316

prominent PAR binding proteins, such as Histone H1, APFL, CHFR, DNA ligase 3, and XRCC1

317

(Fig. 5C) (36). From a structural standpoint it is unclear why MERS-CoV would bind PAR while

318

the other CoV Mac1 proteins do not. Further investigation is needed to understand the PAR

319

binding ability of these macrodomains, such as determining the length of PAR chains they bind

320

to, and if it is relevant for their true biological functions.

321

While all previous studies of macrodomain de-ADP-ribosylation have primarily used

322

radiolabeled substrate, we obtained highly repeatable and robust data utilizing antibodies

323

designed to specifically recognize MAR and PAR (37, 38). The use of these antibodies should

324

enhance the feasibility of this assay for many labs that are not equipped for radioactive work.

325

Utilizing these antibodies, we further developed an ELISA assay for de-MARylation that has the

326

ability to dramatically increase the number of samples that can be analyzed compared to the gel-

327

based assay. To our knowledge, previously developed ELISA assays were to measure the ADP-

328

ribosyltransferase activities (39) but no ELISA has been established to test the ADP-

329

ribosylhydrolase activity of macrodomain proteins. This ELISA assay should be useful to those

330

in the field for defining enzyme kinetics and screening compounds for macrodomain inhibitors

331

that could be either valuable research tools or potential therapeutics.

332

The functional importance of Mac1 has been demonstrated in several reports, mostly

333

utilizing the mutation of a highly conserved asparagine that mediates contact with the distal

334

ribose (Fig. 3B) (16, 19, 20). However, the proteins that are targeted by the CoV Mac1 for de-

335

ADP-ribosylation remains unknown. Regardless, from these reports it is clear that CoV Mac1 is

336

vital for the ability of these viruses to cause disease, and have indicated that it could be a novel

337

therapeutic target. Despite this, there are no known compounds that inhibit this domain. The

338

outbreak of COVID-19 has illustrated an incredible need for developing multiple therapeutic

339

drugs targeting conserved coronavirus proteins. Mac1 appears to be an ideal candidate for further

340

drug development based on its: i) highly conserved structure and biochemical activities within

341

CoVs; and ii) clear importance for multiple CoVs to cause disease. Targeting Mac1 may also

342

have the benefit of enhancing the innate immune response, as we have shown that Mac1 is

343

required for some CoVs to block IFN production (16, 21). Considering that Mac1 proteins from

344

divergent αCoVs such as 229E and FIPV also have de-ADP-ribosylating activity (14, 15), it is

345

possible that compounds targeting Mac1 could prevent disease caused by of wide variety of

346

CoV, including those of veterinary importance like porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).

347

Additionally, compounds that inhibit Mac1 in combination with the structure could help identify

348

the mechanisms it uses to bind to its biologically relevant protein substrates, remove ADP-ribose

349

from these proteins, and potentially define the precise function for Mac1 in SARS-CoV-2

350

replication and pathogenesis. In conclusion, the results described here will be critical for the

351

design and development of highly-specific Mac1 inhibitors that could be used therapeutically to

352

mitigate COVID-19 or future CoV outbreaks.

METHODS

355

Plasmids

356

The SARS-CoV macrodomain (Mac1) (residues 1000-1172 of pp1a) was cloned into the

357

pET21a+ expression vector with an N-terminal His tag. The MERS-CoV Mac1 (residues 1110-

358

1273 of pp1a) was also cloned into pET21a+ with a C-terminal His tag. SARS-CoV-2 Mac1

359

(residues 1023-1197 of pp1a) was cloned into the pET30a+ expression vector with an N-terminal

360

His tag and a TEV cleavage site (Synbio). The pETM-CN Mdo2 Mac1 (residues 7-243)

361

expression vector with an N-terminal His-TEV-V5 tag and the pGEX4T-PARP10-CD (residues

362

818-1025) expression vector with an N-terminal GST tag were previously described (30). All

363

plasmids were confirmed by restriction digest, PCR, and direct sequencing.

364

Protein Expression and Purification

365

A single colony of E. coli cells (C41(DE3)) containing plasmids harboring the constructs

366

of the macrodomain proteins was inoculated into 10 mL LB media and grown overnight at 37°C

367

with shaking at 250 rpm. The overnight culture was transferred to a shaker flask containing 2X

368

1L TB media at 37oC until the OD600 reached 0.7. The proteins were either induced with 0.4

369

mM IPTG at 37oC for 3 hours, or 17°C for 20 hours. Cells were pelleted at 3500 × g for 10 min

370

and frozen at -80°C. Frozen cells were thawed at room temperature, resuspended in 50 mM Tris

371

(pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, and sonicated using the following cycle parameters: Amplitude: 50%,

372

Pulse length: 30 seconds, Number of pulses: 12, while incubating on ice for >1min between

373

pulses. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifuging the cell lysate at 45,450 × g for 30

374

minutes at 4°C. The expressed soluble proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using

375

a 5 ml prepacked HisTrap HP column on an AKTA Pure protein purification system (GE

376

Healthcare). The fractions were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a

377

Superdex 75 10/300 GL column equilibrated with 20mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and the

378

protein sized as a monomer relative to the column calibration standards. To cleave off the His tag

379

from the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, purified TEV protease was added to purified SARS-CoV-2 Mac1

380

protein at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w), and then passed back through the Ni-NTA HP column. Protein

381

was collected in the flow through and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl.

382

The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, free from the N-terminal 6X-His tag, was used for subsequent

383

crystallization experiments.

384

For the PARP10-CD protein, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH

385

8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and sonicated as described above.

386

The cell lysate was incubated with 10 ml of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin from GE Healthcare,

387

equilibrated with the same buffer for 2 hours, then applied to a gravity flow column to allow

388

unbound proteins to flow through. The column was washed with the resuspension buffer till the

389

absorbance at 280 nm reached baseline. The bound protein was eluted out of the column with

390

resuspension buffer containing 20 mM reduced glutathione and then dialyzed back into the

391

resuspension buffer overnight at 4°C.

392

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

393

All ITC titrations were performed on a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC instrument (Malvern

394

Pananalytical Inc., MA). All reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl

395

using 100 μM of all macrodomain proteins at 25°C. Titration of 2 mM ADP-ribose or ATP

396

(MilliporeSigma) contained in the stirring syringe included a single 0.4 μL injection, followed by

397

18 consecutive injections of 2 μL. Data analysis of thermograms was analyzed using one set of

398

binding sites model of the MicroCal ITC software to obtain all fitting model parameters for the

399

experiments.

Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF)

401

Thermal shift assay with DSF involved use of LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche

402

Diagnostics). In total, a 15 μL mixture containing 8X SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen), and 10 μM

403

macrodomain protein in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, NaOH, pH 7.5 and various

404

concentrations of ADP-ribose were mixed on ice in 384-well PCR plate (Roche). Fluorescent

405

signals were measured from 25 to 95 °C in 0.2 °C/30-s steps (excitation, 470-505 nm; detection,

406

540-700 nm). The main measurements were carried out in triplicate. Data evaluation and Tm

407

determination involved use of the Roche LightCycler® 480 Protein Melting Analysis software,

408

and data fitting calculations involved the use of single site binding curve analysis on Graphpad

409

Prism.

De-MARylation Assays

411

Automodification of PARP10-CD protein: A 10 μM solution of purified PAPR10-CD

412

protein was incubated for 20 minutes at 37oC with 1 mM final concentration of β-Nicotinamide

413

Adenine Dinucleotide (β NAD+) (Millipore-Sigma) in a reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150

414

mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, and 0.02% NP-40). MARylated PARP10 was aliquoted and stored at -

415

80oC.

416

PAPR10-CD ADP-ribose hydrolysis: All reactions were performed at 37oC for the

417

designated time. A 1 μM solution of MARylated PARP10-CD and purified Mac1 protein was

418

added in the reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, and 0.02% NP-40).

419

The reaction was stopped with addition of 2X Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-

420

mercaptoethanol.

423

running buffer. For direct protein detection, the SDS-PAGE gel was stained using InstantBlue®

424

Protein Stain (Expedeon). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were transferred onto

425

polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using iBlot™ 2 Dry Blotting System

426

(ThermoFisher Scientific). The blot was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05%

427

Tween-20 and probed with anti-mono or poly ADP-ribose binding antibodies MABE1076 (α-

428

MAR), MABC547 (α-PAR), MABE1075 (α-MAR/PAR) (Millipore-Sigma) and anti-GST tag

429

monoclonal antibody MA4-004 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The primary antibodies were detected

430

with secondary infrared anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences). All

431

immunoblots were visualized using Odyssey® CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The

432

images were quantitated using Image J software (National Institutes for Health (NIH)).

433

ELISA-based MAR hydrolysis: ELISA Well-Coated™ Glutathione plates (G-Biosciences,

434

USA) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T)

435

and incubated with 50 μL of 100 nM automodified MARylated PARP10-CD in PBS for one

436

hour under room temperature. Following four washes with PBS-T, variable concentrations of

437

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 were incubated with MARylated PARP10-CD for 30 minutes at 37oC.

438

Purified macrodomains were 2-fold serially diluted starting at 100 nM in reaction buffer prior to

439

addition to MARylated PARP10-CD. Subsequently, ELISA wells were washed four times with

440

PBS-T and incubated with 50 µL/well of anti-GST (Invitrogen MA4-004) or anti-MAR

441

(Millipore-Sigma MAB1076) diluted 1:5,000 in 5 mg/ml BSA in PBS-T (BSA5-PBS-T) for 1

442

hour at room temperature. After four additional washes with PBS-T, each well was incubated

443

with 50 μL diluted 1:5,000 in BSA5-PBS-T of anti-rabbit-HRP (SouthernBiotech, USA) or anti-

444

mouse-HRP (Rockland Immunochemicals, USA) conjugate for 1 hour at room temperature. The

445

plate was washed four times with PBS-T and 100 μL of TMB peroxidase substrate solution

446

(SouthernBiotech, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. The peroxidase

447

reaction was stopped with 50 μL per well of 1 M HCl before proceeding to reading. Absorbance

448

was measured at 450 nm and subtracted from 620 nm using Biotek Powerwave XS plate reader

449

(BioTek). As controls, MARylated PARP10-CD and non-MARylated PARP10 were detected

450

with both anti-MAR and anti-GST antibodies. The absorbance of non-MARylated PARP10-CD

451

detected with anti-MAR antibody was used to establish the background signal. The % signal

452

remaining was calculated by dividing the experimental signal (+ enzyme) minus background by

453

the control (no enzyme) minus the background.

454

PAR Binding Assay

455

Proteins were slot-blotted on a 0.2 µm pore–size nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad)

456

using a Bio-Dot® microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Sixty picomoles of macrodomain proteins

457

Mdo2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 diluted in 200 μL TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH

458

7.5, 150 mM NaCl) were applied to the vacuum manifold sample template. Calf thymus histone

459

H1 (Calbiochem) and DNAse I (Roche) were respectively used as positive and negative PAR-

460

binding proteins. Following complete aspiration of the protein samples, the nitrocellulose

461

membrane was rinsed three times in 50 mL TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,

462

0.01% Tween-20). The membrane was incubated with TBS-T containing 100 nM PAR purified

463

by dihydroxyboronyl Bio-Rex (DHBB) chromatography (40). The membranes were extensively

464

washed with TBS-T and blocked with a PBS-MT solution (PBS supplemented with 5% milk and

465

0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hour. The membrane was then incubated with the anti-PAR monoclonal

466

antibody clone 10H (Tulip Biolabs) or the polyclonal antibody 96-10 (38) for 1 hour. The

467

membrane was extensively washed with PBS-T and incubated with the corresponding

468

peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min. The

469

membrane was finally washed three times with PBS-T and signal was detected using the Western

470

Lightning® Plus ECL chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer). SYPRO™ Ruby protein blot

471

stain was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad) to assess the efficiency of

472

protein transfer to the nitrocellulose membrane. Fluorescence imaging was acquired using a

473

Geliance CCD-based bioimaging system (PerkinElmer).

De-PARylation Assay

475

Automodification of PARP1 protein: PARP1 was incubated with increasing

476

concentrations of NAD+ to generate a range of PARP1 automodification levels. Highly purified

477

human 6X-His-PARP1 (41) (5 μg) was incubated for 30 min at 30°C in a reaction buffer

478

containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 0 to 500

479

μM NAD+, 10% (v/v) ethanol and 25 μg/mL calf thymus activated DNA (Sigma-Aldrich).

480

PARP1 ADP-ribose hydrolysis: To evaluate the PAR hydrolase activity of CoV

481

macrodomains, 200 ng of slightly automodified PARP1 with 5 μM NAD+ or highly

482

automodified with 500 μM NAD+ were used as substrates for the de-PARylation assays.

483

Recombinant macrodomain protein (1 μg) was supplemented to the reaction buffer (100 mM

484

Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 10 mM DTT) containing automodified PARP1 and

485

incubated for 1 hour at 37oC. Recombinant PARG (1 μg) was used as a positive control for PAR

486

erasing (42). Reaction mixtures were resolved on 4–12% Criterion™ XT Bis-Tris protein gels,

487

transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the anti-PAR polyclonal antibody 96-

488

10 as described for the polymer-blot assays.

experiments were setup using an NT8 drop-setting robot (Formulatrix Inc.) and UVXPO MRC

493

(Molecular Dimensions) sitting drop vapor diffusion plates at 18°C. 100 nL of protein and 100

495

SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 complex with ADP-ribose was prepared by adding the ligand, from a 100

496

mM stock in water, to the protein at a final concentration of 2 mM. Crystals that were obtained in

497

1-2 days from the Salt Rx HT screen (Hampton Research) condition E10 (1.8 M

498

NaH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 8.2). Refinement screening was conducted using the additive screen HT

499

(Hampton Research) by supplementing 10% of each additive to the Salt Rx HT E10 condition in

500

a new 96-well UVXPO crystallization plate. The crystals used for data collection were obtained

501

from Salt Rx HT E10 supplemented with 0.1 M NDSB-256 from the additive screen (Fig. S1).

502

Samples were transferred to a fresh drop composed of 80% crystallization solution and 20%

503

(v/v) PEG 200 and stored in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the

504

Advanced Photon Source, IMCA-CAT beamline 17-ID using a Dectris Eiger 2X 9M pixel array

505

detector.

506

Structure Solution and Refinement: Intensities were integrated using XDS (43, 44) via

507

Autoproc (45) and the Laue class analysis and data scaling were performed with Aimless (46).

508

Notably, a pseudo-translational symmetry peak was observed at (0, 0.31 0.5) that was 44.6% of

509

the origin. Structure solution was conducted by molecular replacement with Phaser (47) using a

510

previously determined structure of ADP-ribose bound SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 (PDB 6W02) as the

511

search model. The top solution was obtained in the space group P21 with four molecules in the

512

asymmetric unit. Structure refinement and manual model building were conducted with Phenix

513

(48) and Coot (49) respectively. Disordered side chains were truncated to the point for which

514

electron density could be observed. Structure validation was conducted with Molprobity (50) and

519

differences in mean values between groups, and graphs are expressed as mean ±SD. Significant p

520

values are denoted with *p≤0.05.

521
