Abstract

STUDY QUESTION

31

Is SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) expressed in the human

32

endometrium during the menstrual cycle, and does it participate in endometrial decidualization?

33

SUMMARY ANSWER

34

ACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase

35

and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

36

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY

37

ACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and

38

placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.

39

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION

40

Proliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-

41

age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium

42

were used in the study.

43

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS

44

ACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and

45

immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of

46

ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell

47

decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone

48

to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.

49

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE

50

In human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the

51

proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.168252; this version posted June 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

52

secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P ˂ 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary

53

human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting

54

siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change

55

and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P ˂ 0.05). In mice during

56

pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through

57

day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri

58

more than vehicle or estrogen (P ˂ 0.05).

61

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION

62

Experiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization

63

were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect

64

decidualization have not been assessed.

65

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS

66

Expression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and

67

stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation.

68

If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

Introduction

76

Although much of the focus during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

77

(SARS-CoV-2)/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been on respiratory

78

symptoms, some reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and the related Middle East Respiratory

79

Syndrome Coronavirus can cause pregnancy complications such as pre-term birth and

80

miscarriages (Favre et al. 2020). Additionally, a few reports noted that pregnant women with

81

COVID-19 had maternal vascular malperfusion and decidual arteriopathy in their placentas

82

(Schwartz and Dhaliwal 2020; Shanes et al. 2020a), and a recent clinical case study reported a

83

second-trimester miscarriage in a woman with COVID-19 (Baud et al. 2020). However, whether

84

SARS-CoV-2 infects the uterus has not been determined.

85

It seems likely that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the uterus because its receptor, Angiotensin

86

Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed fairly ubiquitously in human tissues such as the lungs,

87

heart, intestine, kidneys, and placenta (Hamming et al. 2004; Harmer et al. 2002; Riviere et al.

88

2005). Moreover, ACE2 functions by cleaving the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to the vasodilator

89

angiotensin (1-7). As a component of the renin–angiotensin system, ACE2 plays an important

90

role in regulating maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. ACE2 is expressed in the rat uterus

91

during mid- and late pregnancy (Merrill et al. 2002; Neves et al. 2008). In addition, ACE2 mRNA

92

expression was noted in the uterus of both rats (Brosnihan et al. 2012) and humans (Vaz-Silva et

93

al. 2009), in which its expression may be higher in the secretory phase than in the proliferative

94

phase of the menstrual cycle (Vaz-Silva et al. 2009).

95

During the secretory phase, the uterine stromal cells prepare for embryo implantation by

96

undergoing a progesterone-mediated differentiation process called decidualization. In this

97

process, the stromal cells divide, change from a fibroblastic to an epithelioid morphology, and

98

change their pattern of gene expression. Decidualization is essential for trophoblast invasion and

99

placentation (Carson et al. 2000; Norwitz et al. 2001; Wilcox et al. 1999), and defects in this

100

process may underlie early pregnancy loss in some women. Given the important function of the

101

uterine stroma and the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the uterus, our goal here was to

102

determine whether ACE2 is expressed in endometrial stromal cells, is regulated by progesterone,

103

and is required for decidualization.

104

Results and Discussion

105

We first sought to determine whether ACE2 is expressed in the endometrium and whether

106

its expression differs according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. Thus, we obtained

107

endometrial biopsies from women during the proliferative or secretory phase of the menstrual

108

cycles and performed immunofluorescence with an ACE2-specific antibody. In the proliferative

109

phase, ACE2 was highly expressed in epithelial cells than in stromal cells (Fig. 1A). However, in

110

the secretory phase, ACE2 expression was increased in the stromal cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, we

111

wondered whether ACE2 expression increased during in vitro decidualization of human

112

endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). We isolated primary HESCs, exposed them to decidualizing

113

conditions, and confirmed that expression of the decidualization markers Prolactin (PRL) and

114

Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) increased over six days. ACE2 mRNA also

115

increased over this time (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this finding, ACE2 protein abundance

116

increased during decidualization, as shown by both immunoblotting (Fig. 2B) and

117

immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C). As expected, ACE2 protein predominantly localized in the

118

cytoplasm and cell membrane of decidualized HESCs.

119

Next, we wondered whether ACE2 was required for primary HESC decidualization. To

120

answer this question, we transfected HESCs with control or ACE2-targeting siRNAs and then

121

exposed the cells to decidualization conditions. HESCs transfected with control siRNA changed

122

from fibroblastic to epithelioid morphology (Fig. 3A) and had increased expression of the

123

decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, HESCs transfected with ACE2-

124

targeting siRNA did not show a morphology change over six days (Fig. 3A) and expressed

125

significantly less PRL, IGFBP1, and ACE2 than control cells (Fig. 3B-C). These results

126

demonstrate that ACE2 is essential for endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

127

Finally, we examined the expression of ACE2 in the endometrium during early pregnancy

128

in mice. We mated female wild-type mice with males of proven fertility and then stained their uteri

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.168252; this version posted June 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

129

with an ACE2-specific antibody at different days in early pregnancy. In days one through four,

130

ACE2 localized to the cytoplasm and cell surface of epithelial and stromal cells. However,

131

beginning on day three, strong ACE2 staining was seen in the cytoplasm of stromal cells. This

132

staining was evident at least through day six, which is when robust decidualization occurs (Fig.

133

4). Given this change in ACE2 abundance during pregnancy, we wondered whether ACE2

134

expression was regulated by steroid hormones. To test this, we ovariectomized six-week-old

135

mice, waited two weeks, treated the mice with either estrogen or progesterone for six hours, and

136

then collected the uteri (Fig. 5A). Uteri from progesterone-treated mice expressed significantly

137

more Ace2 mRNA than uteri from vehicle-treated mice, which expressed significantly more Ace2

138

mRNA than uteri from estrogen-treated (Fig. 5B). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence

139

revealed that uteri from progesterone-treated mice had significantly more ACE2 protein in stromal

140

cells than did uteri from vehicle- or estrogen-treated mice (Fig. 5C).

141

Together, our findings suggest that ACE2 expression in the endometrial stroma is

142

promoted by progesterone in both humans and mice. Moreover, we show that ACE2 is required

143

for human stromal cell decidualization. Given the high ACE2 expression in the human

144

endometrium, SARS-CoV-2 may be able to enter endometrial stromal cells and elicit pathological

145

manifestations in women with COVID-19. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk

146

of early pregnancy loss. As more data become available, epidemiologists and obstetricians should

147

focus on this important issue and determine whether women who intend to get pregnant should

148

undergo additional health screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Materials and Methods

150

Human ethical approval and endometrial stromal cell isolation

151

Informed consent was obtained in accordance with a protocol approved by the Washington

152

University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (IRB ID #: 201612127). Additionally, all work

153

involving human subjects followed the guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration of

154

Helsinki. Human endometrial biopsies of healthy, reproductive-age women were collected during

155

the proliferative phase (days 9 to 12) and secretory phase (days 14 to 26) of the menstrual cycle.

156

HESCs were isolated as described previously (Camden et al. 2017; Michalski et al. 2018). Briefly,

157

proliferative phase endometrial biopsies were minced with sterile scissors and then digested in

158

DMEM/F12 medium containing 2.5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA)

159

and 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. Then, detached cells were

160

centrifuged at 800g for 2.5 min. collected, and layered over a Ficoll-Paque reagent layer and

161

centrifuged for 30 min. at 400g (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) to remove

162

lymphocytes. The HESC fraction from the top layer was collected and filtered through a 40 µm

163

nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). HESCs collected from the filtrate were

164

suspended in DMEM/F-12 media containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml

165

streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Independent HESC lines isolated from three patients were

166

used for each experiment. Represented data are from a single patient with three technical

167

replicates.

168

Transfection and HESC decidualization

169

HESCs were grown in a six-well culture plate to 60%–70% confluence and transfected with 60

170

pmol of non-targeting siRNA (D-001810-10-05) or siRNAs targeting ACE2 (L-005755-00-0005)

171

(GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO) in Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen

172

Corporation, Carlsbad, USA) as described previously (Camden et al. 2017). After 48 hours,

173

HESCs were decidualized by culturing in EPC (Estrogen, Medroxy Progesterone Acetate and

175

no. E1024, Sigma-Aldrich], 10 µM Medroxyprogesterone17-acetate [cat. no. M1629, Sigma-

176

Aldrich], and 50 µM 8-Bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt [cat. no. B7880,

177

Sigma-Aldrich]). The EPC medium was changed every 48 hours until day six, when the cells were

178

harvested for RNA isolation with the total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand

179

Island, NY) or for protein isolation.

180

Quantitative real-time PCR

181

Total RNA was extracted from uterine tissues or HESCs by using the total RNA isolation kit

182

(Invitrogen/Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified

183

with a Nano-Drop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Then, 1 µg of RNA was reverse

184

transcribed with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,

185

MA, USA). The amplified cDNA was diluted to 10 ng/µl, and quantitative PCR was performed with

186

primers specified in Table S1 and Fast Taqman 2X mastermix (Applied Biosystems/Life

187

Technologies, Grand Island, NY) on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems/Life

188

Technologies). Ribosomal RNA (18S) was used as an internal control for gene specific primers.

189

(Camden et al. 2017; Kommagani et al. 2013; Kommagani et al. 2016).

190

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting

191

Protein extracts were prepared from HESCs as described previously (Oestreich et al. 2020).

192

Briefly, total proteins were extracted by homogenizing cells in RIPA lysis buffer (cat. no. 9806,

193

Cell Signaling Technology) and centrifuging at 14,000 g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatants

194

were collected and protein was quantified with the BCA Protein Assay kit according to the

195

manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce BCA protein assay kit, cat no. 23227). Lysates containing 40

196

μg of protein were loaded on a 4-15% SDS-PAGE gel, separated with 1x Tris-Glycine Running

197

Buffer, and transferred to PVDF membranes on a wet electro-blotting system (all from Bio-Rad,

198

USA), all according to the manufacturer’s directions. The PVDF membranes were washed,

blocked for 1 hour in 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T (Bio-Rad, USA), and incubated with primary

200

antibodies anti-ACE2 (1:1000, ab15348, Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (1:3000, #2118S Cell

201

Signaling Technology, USA) in 5% BSA in TBS-T overnight at 4oC. Then, blots were probed with

202

anti-Rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, #7074, Cell Signaling

203

Technology) in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature. Signal was detected by using

204

the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, MA, USA), and blot images

205

were collected with a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system (Kommagani et al. 2016).

206

Immunofluorescence

207

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (5 µm) of human endometrium and mouse uterus

208

were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in an ethanol gradient, and then boiled in antigen

209

retrieval citrate buffer (Vector Laboratories Inc., CA, USA). Subsequently, sections were blocked

210

with 2.5% goat serum in PBS (Vector laboratories) for one hour at room temperature, and then

211

incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-ACE2 antibody (1:200, ab15348, Abcam) or normal rabbit

212

IgG (#2729, Cell Signaling Technology). Then, sections were washed with PBS, incubated with

213

Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies) for one hour at room

214

temperature, washed three times with PBS, and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant

215

with DAPI (cat. no. P36962 Thermo Scientific). Immunofluorescence images were captured on a

216

confocal microscope (Leica DMI 4000B).

217

Immunocytochemistry

218

HESCs were grown on poly-L-Lysine coated coverslips in 12-well plates and allowed to

219

decidualize for six days in EPC media as described above. Then, cells were fixed with 4%

220

paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar, USA) in PBS) for 20 min. at room temperature, washed with PBS,

221

and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, USA) in PBS for 20 min. at room

222

temperature. Then, cells were washed, blocked with 2.5% normal goat-serum (Vector

223

laboratories) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-ACE2

antibody (ab15348, Abcam, 1:200) in 2.5% normal goat serum. Cells were washed and incubated

225

with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) for one hour at room

temperature and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Scientific).

227

Images were captured on a confocal microscope (Leica DMI 4000B).

228

Mice and hormone treatments

229

All mouse experimental procedures followed a protocol approved by the Washington University

230

in St. Louis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number 20191079). CD1 wild-

231

type mice (Charles River, Saint Louis, Missouri) were maintained on a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle.

232

Sexually mature (8-week-old) CD1 females were mated to fertile wild-type males, and copulation

233

was confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug on the following morning, designated as 1 day

234

post-coital (dpc). Mice were euthanized, and uteri were collected on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dpc. To

235

determine the uterine estrogen or progesterone responses, six-week-old CD1 mice were

236

bilaterally ovariectomized, rested for two weeks to allow the endogenous ovarian-derived steroid

237

hormones to dissipate, and then subcutaneously injected with 100 μl sesame oil (vehicle control),

238

1 mg progesterone, or 100 ng estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 μl sesame oil. Six hours later, mice

239

were euthanized, uterine tissues were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and RNA was

240

isolated and processed for qRT-PCR (Kommagani et al. 2016).

241

Statistical analyses

242

A two-tailed paired Student t-test was used to analyze experiments with two experimental groups,

243

and analysis of variance by non-parametric alternatives was used for multiple comparisons to

244

analyze experiments containing more than two groups. P<0.05 was considered significant. All

245

data are presented as mean ± SEM. GraphPad Prism 8 software was used for all statistical

246

analyses.
