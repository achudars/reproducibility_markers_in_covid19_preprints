Abstract
Forecasting the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir populations of wild or domestic
animals is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as wildlife
vaccination or culling. Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited
availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is
challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing
on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches,
however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data
during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the
pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of
spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires
that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine
learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training
models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this
range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these
reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover
into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast
that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our
method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human
population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically
significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When
combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover
risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across
West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.

Author Summary
The 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a grim reminder of the threat animal-borne
pathogens pose to human health. Even prior to SARS-CoV-2, the spillover of pathogens
from animal reservoirs was a persistent problem, with pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah,
and Lassa regularly but unpredictably causing outbreaks. Machine-learning models that

anticipate when and where pathogen transmission from animals to humans is likely to
occur would help guide surveillance efforts and preemptive countermeasures like
information campaigns or vaccination programs. We develop a novel machine learning
framework that uses datasets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and
the range of its animal host, along with data on spatial patterns of human immunity, to
infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a region. By training the model on
data from the animal host alone, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover
predictions using human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of
West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and use the predictions to update
estimates of Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most
at risk for the emergence of Lassa virus, and should be prioritized for
outbreak-surveillance.

Introduction

1

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a persistent threat to public health.

2

Approximately 60% of EIDs are caused by pathogens that normally circulate in wild or

3

domestic animal reservoirs (i.e., zoonotic pathogens) [1]. Prior to full scale emergence,

4

interaction between humans and wildlife creates opportunities for the occasional

5

transfer, or spillover, of the zoonotic pathogen into human populations [2]. These initial

6

spillover infections, in turn, represent newly established pathogen populations in human

7

hosts that are subject to evolutionary pressures and may potentially lead to increased

8

transmission among humans [2, 3]. Consequently, a key step in preempting the threat of

9

EIDs is careful monitoring of when and where spillover into the human population

10

occurs. However, because the majority of EIDs from wildlife originate in low and middle

11

income regions with limited disease surveillance, accurately estimating the rate and

12

geographical range of pathogen spillover, and therefore the risk of new EIDs, is a major

13

challenge [1].

14

Machine learning techniques have shown promise at predicting the geographical

February 18, 2021

15

range of spillover risk for several zoonotic diseases including Lassa fever [4–6],

16

Ebola [7, 8], and Leishmaniases [9]. Generally, these models are trained to associate

17

environmental features with the presence or absence of case reports in humans or the

associated reservoir. Once inferred from the training process, the learned relationships

19

between disease presence and the environment can be extended across a region of

20

interest. Using these techniques, previous studies of Lassa fever (LF) have derived risk

21

maps that assess the likelihood of human LF cases being present in different regions of

22

West Africa [4, 5]. However, because these forecasts combine case-reports from both

23

rodents and humans in the training process, they conflate attributes of the human and

24

reservoir populations that increase spillover risk. Consequently, these approaches shed

25

little light on aspects of reservoir or human populations that determine the magnitude

26

of spillover at a location and thus miss opportunities to identify effective interventions.

27

We develop a multi-layer machine learning framework that accounts for the

February 18, 2021

28

differences between how data involving a wildlife reservoir, and data from human

29

serosurveys, can simultaneously inform spillover risk in people and rigorously assess

30

whether predicted risk quantifies the rate of new infections in humans. Our approach

31

uses machine learning algorithms that, when trained on data from the wildlife reservoir

32

alone, estimate the likelihood that the reservoir and the zoonotic pathogen are present

33

in an area. These predictions are then combined into a composite estimate of spillover

34

risk to humans. Next, our framework uses estimates of human pathogen seroprevalence,

35

as well as estimates of human population density, to translate the composite risk

36

estimate into a prediction of the realized rate of zoonotic spillover into humans.

37

Omitting human seroprevalence data from the training process of the risk-layer has

38

several advantages. First, in the case of LF, due to modern transportation and the

39

longevity of Lassa virus antibodies in humans, a general concern is that the reported

40

location of individual cases of human disease or Lassa virus antibody detection is not

41

the site at which the infection occurred [10–12]. If the dispersal ability of the reservoir

42

is small, training the risk layer on reservoir infections alone helps the model avoid these

43

biases when learning the spatial variation of spillover risk. Secondly, in our framework,

44

human seroprevalence estimates provide an ultimate test of the risk layer’s ability to

45

correlate with spatial variation in the cumulative human exposure to the pathogen. The

46

seroprevalence data, in turn, stem from population-based surveys at a site and are

47

therefore much less likely to be influenced by the movement of individuals.

48

We apply our framework to Lassa virus (formally Lassa mammarenavirus [LASV]), a

49

bi-segmented, single-stranded ambisense RNA virus in the Arenaviridae family and the

causative agent of LF in West Africa [11, 13]. Though LASV can transmit directly

51

between humans and often does so in hospital settings [14], rodent-to-human

52

transmission accounts for the majority of new LASV infections [11, 15]. Specifically, the

53

multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis is believed to be responsible for most of the

54

transmission into the human population, either through consumption of food

55

contaminated by rodent feces and urine or through hunting and consumption of the

56

rodent reservoir itself [16]. What remains largely unknown, however, is the extent to

57

which spatial patterns of spillover are driven by spatial variation in the abundance of M.

58

natalensis and viral prevalence within M. natalensis relative to spatial variation in other

59

contributing factors such as human behavior, housing materials, or other rodent

60

reservoirs. An additional unknown is the true magnitude of spillover into the human

61

population outside of the few areas in Sierra Leone and Nigeria where hospitals with

62

Lassa diagnostic capacity exist. As a consequence, most estimates for the magnitude of

63

Lassa virus spillover rely on longitudinal serosurveys conducted in the 1980s in Sierra

64

Leone [17], yielding estimates of between 100,000 and 300,000 LASV infections each

65

year across West Africa. Here, we use our framework to fill these important gaps in our

66

current understanding of Lassa virus spillover within West Africa.

67

Data and Study Region

68

We used online data repositories and literature sources to collect three types of data in

69

West Africa spanning the time-range 1970 - 2017: 1) capture-locations of M. natalensis,

70

as well as occurrence locations of non-Mastomys murids; 2) locations and outcomes of

71

LASV surveys conducted in M. natalensis; and 3) locations and measured

72

seroprevalence of human LASV serosurveys. The focal region from which our data

73

originate, shown in Fig 1, was chosen as the intersection of West Africa and the

74

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) range map for Mastomys

75

natalensis [18, 19]. Though M. natalensis is widely distributed across all of Africa, the

76

species consists of multiple clades that likely differ in their ability to serve as hosts to

77

LASV [20, 21]. By limiting the spatial extent of the study region to West Africa we

78

focus on the region occupied by the A-I clade of M. natalensis that is believed to

79

transmit LASV [22]. Our M. natalensis capture data, as well as all of the LASV survey

We collected data on historical captures of M. natalensis from various sources. First,

91

several sources were used to identify all countries of West Africa that contain M.

were cross-referenced to fill in details regarding the year of capture, latitude/longitude

coordinates, and the method of identification for each location at which M. natalensis

95

was documented [17, 20, 27–42]. Because M. natalensis is morphologically similar to

96

other rodents in the study region (e.g., Mastomys erythroleucus), we only include those

97

presences that have been confirmed with genetic methods or skull morphology. We

98

found 167 locations with confirmed M. natalensis captures. All M. natalensis captures

99

occurred in the time-range 1977 - 2017.

100

Fitting the model requires supplementing the presence-only data with background
points, also called pseudo-absences [43, 44]. Background points serve as an estimate of

102

the distribution of sampling effort for the organism being modeled [45]. We used

103

background points chosen from locations where rodents in the family Muridae had been

104

captured in West Africa from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)

105

website [46]. We filtered the original dataset to reduce the likelihood of including M.

106

natalensis rodents that were misidentified as M. erythroleucus and vice versa. Namely,

107

we omit from the collection all Murid occurrences that are within the genus Mastomys.

108

In addition, to ensure that the GBIF captures are concurrent with captures of M.

109

natalensis, we only retained captures that occurred in the time-frame of the M.

110

natalensis captures. Finally, we only included records that are within the study region

111

depicted in Fig 1 and that fall outside of any pixel that contains a documented M.

112

natalensis. The resulting GBIF dataset spans the years 1977 - 2015.

113

These data were used to categorize the subset of the pixels that contained one or

more captures into two exclusive categories: those in which at least one M. natalensis

had been captured (termed presences), and those with only non-Mastomys rodent

as capture-positive for M. natalensis, and 252 pixels as background (Table 1).

Surveys of Mastomys natalensis for Lassa virus

119

We compiled a dataset that contains occurrences of LASV in rodents or humans. The

120

dataset was established by an extensive review of LASV literature. Primary sources

121

were found by PubMed and GenBank searches of the terms “Lassa”, “Lassa fever”,

122

“Lassa virus”, “Lassa arenavirus”, and “Lassa mammarenavirus” [47]. Data from these
primary sources was organized into an Excel workbook.

124

From the full LASV dataset, we collected published studies that sampled M.

February 18, 2021

123

125

natalensis rodents for indicators of LASV. For each study, we found the sampling

126

location for each tested rodent (either latitude/longitude or a locality name for which

127

coordinates could be obtained). In total, we compiled thirteen rodent

128

studies [17, 30, 34, 36, 39, 41, 42, 48–53] that tested M. natalensis for LASV and contained

129

latitude/longitude coordinates. The resulting test locations originate from six countries

130

and span the years 1972 – 2014.

131

Because the prevalence of LASV in rodents varies seasonally [54], and because of the

132

sparsity of time-series data that might otherwise allow the average LASV prevalence in

133

rodents to be estimated, we used the collected data to broadly classify pixels into the

134

categories “Lassa positive” or “Lassa negative”. Specifically, a pixel was defined as

135

Lassa positive if, at some point, a M. natalensis rodent was captured within the pixel,

and the rodent tested positive for LASV using a RT-PCR assay or viral isolation.

137

Because arenavirus antibodies cross-react, a positive LASV antibody test in an

138

individual rodent only indicates past infection with an arenavirus, and not necessarily

139

LASV. In an effort to reduce the frequency of false positives in the training data, pixels

140

that only contain LASV seropositive tests of rodents, and no positive LASV viral

141

detection, were not used as training data. These criteria led to the omission of eight

142

pixels from the training data. Fitting the model with these eight pixels included as

143

presences is an option in the code on the github repository, but does not substantially

144

affect the overall fit of the model [23].

145

Although serosurveys of rodents cannot specifically show that LASV is present, they
can indicate the absence of LASV (along with all other arenaviruses). Pixels were

147

classified as Lassa negative if five or more M. natalenis rodents in total were tested for

148

infection with LASV by RT-PCR, or tested for any previous arenavirus exposure using

149

a serological assay, and all rodents tested were negative. We chose a threshold of five to

150

help reduce the chance of including false negatives (i.e. sites that have LASV but in

151

which only non-exposed rodents were captured). This procedure allowed us to classify

152

62 unique pixels in total: 27 were classified as Lassa negative, and 35 were classified as

153

Lassa positive (Table 2 and Fig 1).

Human seroprevalence data

155

From our full LASV dataset described in the previous section, we collected literature

156

sources that describe the prevalence of arenavirus antibodies in human populations of

157

West Africa. As with the rodent LASV infection data, arenavirus antibodies are not

158

specific to LASV. However, because human serosurveys were often conducted in LASV

159

endemic areas or near documented locations of LASV-infected rodents, these

160

serosurveys likely measured the fraction of humans with previous LASV infection, rather

161

than exposure to another arenavirus. We required that each literature source include

162

information on the diagnostic method that was used to test individuals (e.g., ELISA,

163

IFA) and broad details of the survey design. We only included survey studies that were

164

designed to estimate the seroprevalence in the local community population. This

165

criterion excluded surveys of hospitals, for example, as well as surveys of missionaries.

166

Each datum contains latitude and longitude of the serosurvey, the number of

167

individuals tested, and the number of individuals determined to have arenavirus

168

antibodies. In total, we collected 94 serosurveys from seven studies (Fig 1) [17, 55–60].

169

These serosurveys were conducted between 1970 and 2015 and are located in five

170

countries in West Africa (Table 3 and Fig 1).

Predictors

172

We include predictors that are broadly hypothesized to influence the distributions of M.

173

natalensis and LASV. M. natalensis is widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa in

174

savanna and shrubland environments. Within such environments, M. natalensis is

175

commonly associated with small rural communities and is considered a serious

176

agricultural pest [19, 54]. To allow the model the possibility to learn these relationships,

177

we include predictors that describe MODIS land cover features as predictors, and also

178

include human population density within each pixel. We also include elevation in

179

meters. Because climate seasonality and crop maturation affect the breeding season of

180

M. natalensis, we include various measures of the seasonality of the vegetative index

181

(NDVI), precipitation, and temperature [61]. See S1 Appendix for a complete list of

182

environmental variables. LASV is often associated with M. natalensis, so we use the

183

same set of predictors for the pathogen layer.

184

Methods

185

We developed a model that predicts the rate of LASV infection in humans within

186

individual 0.05◦ x0.05◦ pixels across West Africa. An overview of the model framework

187

is depicted in Fig 2. Outputs from the model are generated in two stages. The first

188

stage uses environmental features to estimate different layers of LASV spillover risk.

189

The layers of risk, in turn, are described by: 1) DM , a classification score indicating the

190

likelihood that a pixel contains the primary rodent reservoir, M. natalensis, and 2) DL ,

191

a score indicating the likelihood that LASV circulates within the M. natalensis

192

population, conditioned on the rodent being present. Depending on the layer, the

193

response variable for this stage is generated from documented occurrences of M.

194

natalensis (DM layer), or evidence of past LASV infection in M. natalensis (DL layer).

195

These layers are used to define a composite layer of spillover risk DX , the product of

196

DM and DL , that describes the likelihood that a pixel simultaneously contains M.

197

natalensis and LASV. The second stage of our framework uses a generalized linear

198

model to regress the estimates of human arenavirus seroprevalence onto the DX layer.

199

Lastly, we used an epidemiological model to estimate human incidence from the

200

predictions of seroprevalence.

LASV risk layers

202

Each risk layer of the first stage is generated by a separate boosted classification tree

203

(BCT). The BCT, in turn, uses environmental features within a pixel to infer a

204

classification score, between zero and one, that indicates how likely it is that the pixel is

205

positive for M. natalensis (DM layer) or LASV in M. natalensis (DL layer). BCTs use

206

a stage-wise learning algorithm that, at each stage, trains a new tree model to the

207

residuals of the current model iteration. Each newly fitted tree is added to the ensemble

208

model, thereby reducing the residual deviance between the model predictions and a

209

training set [62]. Boosted trees are commonly used in species and disease distribution

210

models because they are simultaneously resistant to over-fitting in scenarios where many

211

feature variables are implemented and are also able to model complex interactions

212

among features [63].

213

Prior to inclusion in the model-fitting procedure, each feature variable was vetted for
its ability to distinguish between presences and absences in each of the layers.

215

Specifically, for each risk layer’s binary response variable, we performed a

216

Mann-Whitney U-test on each candidate feature. In doing so, we test the null

217

hypothesis that the distribution of a feature is the same between pixels that are

218

classified as a presence or (pseudo) absence. We only include predictors for which the

219

null hypothesis is rejected at the α = 0.05 level.

220

For a given training set, we fit the BCT model using the gbm.step function of the
“dismo” package in the statistical language R [64]. This specific function uses 10-fold

221

222

cross-validation to determine the number of successive trees that best model the

223

relationship between response and features without over-fitting the data [64]. The

224

learning rate parameter, which determines the weight given to each successive tree, was

225

set to small values (DM : 10−2 , DL : 10−3 ) that encourage a final model that is

226

composed of many small incremental improvements. A smaller learning rate was used in

227

the DL layer because the corresponding dataset was smaller. The parameter that

228

describes the maximum number of allowable trees was set to a large value (107 ) to

229

ensure that the cross-validation fitting process was able to add trees until no further

230

improvement occurred [62].

231

For the DM layer, we trained 25 boosted classification trees to learn how

environmental predictors influence the suitability of a habitat for M. natalensis. Each

233

model was fit by selecting 155 presence pixels and pairing these with 155 background

234

pixels in which only non-Mastomys murids were found. Both presences and background

235

pixels were chosen with replacement. By choosing equal numbers of presences and

236

background pixels for each training set, we encourage each model to learn patterns in

237

features that allow presences to be discriminated from background pixels, rather than

238

having the model learn the (likely biased) distribution of presences and background

239

pixels that are available in the overall dataset [44].

240

For each model fit for the DM layer, presence and pseudo-absence pixels that were
not used to train the model (i.e., out-of-bag data) were used to test the model using the

242

area-under-the-receiver-curve (AUC). The AUC measures a classifier’s ability to assign

243

a high classification score to presences, and a low score to background pixels. A score of

244

one indicates a perfect classifier, and a score of 0.5 indicates a classifier that is no better

245

than chance. A pairwise-distance sampling scheme was used to pair an equal number of

246

test-background pixels to the out-of-bag presences that together comprise the test set.

247

Specifically, for each test presence point, the pairwise distance sampling method chooses

248

a test background point so that the minimum spatial distance between the training

249

presences and test presence is similar to the minimum distance between the test

250

background point and training presences [65]. Compared to random selection of test

251

background points, pairwise distance sampling oftentimes results in a lower AUC score

252

that more accurately measures the model’s ability to generalize to new regions [65].

253

The DL layer is generated by the averaged predictions of 25 boosted classification

February 18, 2021

241

254

tree models, each of which is trained to discriminate between pixels that are Lassa

255

positive or Lassa negative. We trained each model on a dataset comprised of 27 absence

256

locations and 27 presence locations, sampled from the full dataset with replacement.

257

The estimation of error in the DL layer is similar to that described in the DM layer.

258

Specifically, we calculate the AUC of the fitted model on an equal number of out-of-bag

259

presences and absences.

260

Next, we combined the DM and DL layers into a composite feature, denoted by DX ,

261

that is indicative of whether a pixel simultaneously has environmental features that are

262

suitable for M. natalensis, as well as LASV in M. natalensis. The combined feature is

263

defined as DX = DM × DL and summarizes the realized risk of LASV spillover to

265

Connection to human seroprevalence and incidence

266

To connect the new risk parameter DX to human arenavirus seroprevalence, and to

267

evaluate the ability of the DX layer to explain historical LASV spillover in humans, we

268

regressed seroprevalence from human arenavirus serosurveys on the DX layer and an

269

intercept. In doing so, we test whether human seroprevalence is significantly associated

270

with the probability DX that a pixel contains LASV-infected M. natalensis. We used

271

quasi-binomial regression to account for overdispersion in seroprevalence measurements

272

that could otherwise contaminate hypothesis tests on model coefficients [66]. More

273

details on the motivation behind the quasi-binomial regression can be found in the S1

274

Appendix. In the regression, each seroprevalence estimate is weighted by the number of

275

individuals tested in the serosurvey.

276

Next, we used an epidemiological model, based on the classic

February 18, 2021

277

susceptible-infected-recovered framework, to derive an equation that relates a given

278

LASV spillover rate into humans and the resulting seroprevalence in a human

279

population. Throughout, we assume that the seroprevalence measures that were

280

obtained from historical serosurveys describe LASV infection at steady state (i.e., are

281

unchanging in time). This derivation, in turn, is used to translate the regression model’s

282

predictions of LASV seroprevalence into spillover infections per year in humans. For the

283

model, we employ several assumptions: 1) humans within each 0.05x0.05◦ pixel

284

constitute a closed population with constant per-capita death rate d. To facilitate

285

steady-state analysis, we assume that new individuals are born in the pixel at a

286

density-independent birth rate b. Within each pixel, humans are compartmentalized

287

into three non-overlapping classes: susceptible (S), infected with LASV (I), and

288

recovered from LASV infection (R). The size of the human population is assumed to be

289

large enough so that stochastic events (LASV extinction) do not occur. 2) All LASV

290

infections in humans are caused by contact with infectious rodents. Though

291

human-to-human transmission of LASV is common in nosocomial outbreaks,

292

rodent-to-human transmission is believed to be the primary pathway by which the virus

293

is spread outside of hospital environments [15]. 3) Susceptible humans become infected

with LASV at a constant rate F S, where F denotes the rate of infectious contact

295

between a human and infected M. natalensis (i.e., the force of infection). Any seasonal

296

fluctuation in the contact rate between humans and rodents, as well as fluctuation in

297

the prevalence of LASV infection in rodents, is assumed to average out over the

298

decades-long timescales we consider. LASV-infected humans transition out of the

299

infected class at per-capita rate γ; a fraction µ die from illness associated with Lassa

300

Fever. 4) The remaining fraction 1 − µ of individuals recover from infection and gain

301

immunity from LASV.

302

The duration of LASV immunity in humans is not fully understood. Studies suggest
that LASV immunity is the result of a combination of antibodies and a cell-mediated

304

immune response [17, 67]. Anecdotal cases have shown that LASV IgG antibodies can

305

remain in the blood of individuals for decades [10]. However, other studies have

306

indicated that the level of LASV antibodies, as well as the extent to which an individual

307

is protected against subsequent LASV infection, can wane with time [17, 67].

308

Preliminary analyses indicated that the possibility of waning immunity substantially

309

influenced our model’s estimates of LASV infections per year. Because of this

310

uncertainty, we model the general scenario in which recovered individuals lose immunity

311

to LASV at per-capita rate λ and transition back into the susceptible class. This more

312

general model structure includes the scenario of lifelong immunity in the case that λ = 0.

313

Within each pixel across West Africa, the assumptions above lead to a system of

314

equations that describes the number of humans in each of the classes:

We assume that, within each pixel, the dynamical system given by System (1) is at

At steady state, the total population size in a pixel is P ∗ = S ∗ + I ∗ + R∗ . We can

By substituting our prediction of human LASV seroprevalence for Ω∗ , we can

estimate the total human infection rate using Eq (6). Calculating these estimates

requires values for d, γ, µ, λ, and P ∗ . We chose parameters that are broadly in line

obtained from WorldBank [68]. For a pixel within a given country, d is set to be the

337

reciprocal mean lifespan of that country’s 2018 life expectancy at birth. Studies indicate

338

that the duration of LASV infection is typically about one month, so that γ = 12 yr−1

339

across all pixels [11]. LASV infection causes mortality in a fraction µ = 0.02 of

340

non-nosocomial infections [17].

341

The rate of seroreversion is difficult to estimate empirically. McCormick et al. (1987)

February 18, 2021

342

estimated that λ = 0.064 yr−1 using a longitudinal study of IgG immune markers in

343

individuals. However, it is unclear whether their results indicated true seroreversion, or

344

whether the reduction of LASV immune markers below detectable levels made it appear

345

as though seroreversion occurred. To better understand the potential consequences of

346

seroreversion in our infection-rate estimates, we focus on two scenarios. In the first, any

347

individual that has recovered from LASV infection remains seropositive for the

348

remainder of their life (λ = 0 yr−1 ). In the second scenario, seroreversion occurs at the

349

rate estimated by McCormick et al. (1987) (λ = 0.064 yr−1 ). In this case, an individual

350

recovered from LASV is assumed to produce antibodies and maintain LASV immunity

351

for an average duration of 15.6 years. We use the unprocessed WorldPop 2020

352

population data (described in S1 Appendix) as an estimate of the steady-state

353

population size, P ∗ , within each pixel of the original 0.0083◦ resolution.

Results

355

LASV risk layers

356

The DM layer is constructed by averaging the predictions of 25 boosted classification

357

tree models. Across all 25 bootstrap fits, the average out-of-bag AUC was 0.68, with a

358

standard deviation of 0.05. This AUC indicates that the model has a modest ability to

359

correctly discriminate pixels in which M. natalensis has been captured from background

360

pixels, and is similar to out-of-bag AUC scores obtained in another study with a similar

361

assessment criterion [5]. The algorithm assigned a high likelihood of occurrence to

362

regions with a strong seasonal pattern of vegetation as well as specific levels of rainfall

363

(S1 Appendix). Across 25 fitted models that made up the DL layer, the average AUC

364

was 0.85, with a standard deviation of 0.08. This indicates a model that is good at

LASV in M. natalensis (S1 Appendix).

Figs 3A-3C show maps of each of the fitted risk layers, as well as the combined layer

countries of West Africa are predicted to harbor this primary rodent reservoir of LASV

371

(Fig 3A). However, the rodent is predicted to be less prevalent along coastal areas of

372

West Africa and southern Nigeria. Similar to other Lassa risk maps [4, 5], our DL layer

predictions indicate that the risk of LASV in rodents is primarily concentrated in the

eastern and western extremes of West Africa (Fig 3B). The combined risk, shown in Fig

Connection to human seroprevalence and spillover

378

A quasi-binomial regression indicated a significant, positive association between the

379

combined LASV risk predictor DX , and the human arenavirus seroprevalence measured

380

in serosurveys (coefficient: 1.50, p = 0.000123, Fig 4). The model also indicated the

381

presence of substantial overdispersion in the human seroprevalence dataset (φ = 15.1).

382

More information on the GLM output can be found in the S1 Appendix. By applying

383

the general linear model to the combined LASV risk layer, we extrapolate the human

384

LASV seroprevalence across West Africa (Fig 5). Our results indicate that human

385

LASV seroprevalence is greatest in the eastern and western regions of West Africa, with

386

especially high seroprevalence in Central Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.

Furthermore, by assuming that our predictions are representative of LASV infection
at steady state, we can derive the number of LASV infections per year in humans. If

389

the DX layer accurately describes the spatial heterogeneity of LASV seroprevalence in

390

humans, and if LASV antibody production upon recovery is lifelong, our framework

391

estimates that 897,700 new human infections occur each year. Between 664,300 –

392

843,800 (i.e., 74 – 94%) of these infections are expected to be sub-clinical or

393

asymptomatic, leaving 53,900 – 233,400 infections that might require

394

hospitalization [17]. Given that 2% of all infections result in fatality, our estimates

395

imply that 18,000 individuals die of Lassa Fever in West Africa each year. Though our

396

model does not account for differences of LASV risk by sex or age, research suggests

397

that hospitalizations may be skewed towards females, and fatalities will be biased

398

towards individuals under 29 years of age but not skewed by gender [69].

infections (531,700) in West Africa will occur in Nigeria (Fig 6). This distribution of

LASV infection is largely due to the greater population size within Nigeria, as the per

Infection rate is in units of number of infections per year per 1000 people. Estimates in
the table are derived assuming seroreversion and reinfection do not occur.

The above estimates are based on the premise that, upon recovery from LASV

infection, an individual produces antibodies for the remainder of their life. If, instead,

LASV antibody production ceases after an average of 15.6 years as suggested by some

Specifically, allowing for seroreversion and subsequent LASV reinfection in the model

implies 4,383,600 infections occur each year. Inclusion of reinfection does not change the

416

Discussion

417

Machine learning approaches that forecast the spatial risk of emerging infectious

418

diseases such as Lassa virus are often not designed to explain how aspects of the

419

environment translate into realized pathogen spillover into human populations [4, 5].

420

Models that specifically predict attributes of the reservoir from the environment, and

421

use these predictions to quantify spillover into humans, offer a more mechanistic

422

understanding of the current and future spatial variation in human disease [70]. Our

423

forecasting framework advances these approaches by generating predictions of spillover

424

risk based only on data from the primary rodent reservoir of LASV, and rigorously

425

assessing our risk predictions on realized human spillover as measured by human

426

arenavirus serosurveys. As indicated by a generalized linear regression, our

427

reservoir-based model of spillover risk explains a modest and statistically significant

428

amount of the spatial variation in human arenavirus seroprevalence.

429

Using this framework, we are able to generate predictions of the number of new

February 18, 2021

430

LASV infections within different regions of West Africa. Our results indicate that

431

Nigeria contributes the greatest number of new human infections each year, and that

432

the magnitude of new infections in Nigeria is driven primarily by its greater human

433

population density, rather than an increased per-capita risk. An assumption that drives

434

this result is the density-dependent form of spillover in the model (i.e., F S), in which

435

rodent-human interactions increase with human population density. This form is

436

appropriate if rodent interactions are well-mixed in the human population. For example,

437

if increases in human density were reflected in an increased number of humans per

438

dwelling, then the LASV risk posed by single rodent in a household would increase with

439

human population size. If these assumptions are correct, Nigeria is likely to represent

440

the greatest risk of LASV emergence because the large number of annual spillover

441

events allows for extensive sampling of viral strain diversity and repeated opportunities

for viral adaptation to the human population [71].

February 18, 2021

443

Our approach allows us to highlight the regions that contribute most to pathogen

444

spillover, and suggest locations for further surveillance. Our model indicates that the

445

highest per-capita risk to humans occurs in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria. Given

446

the data that are currently available, our model suggests that these countries should be

447

prioritized for surveillance of LASV emergence in rodents and at-risk human

448

populations. Human serosurveys of the general population are notably lacking in

449

Nigeria, but have the potential to clarify the true magnitude of LASV spillover in West

450

Africa. Although it is known that certain broad regions of West Africa have a long

451

history of LASV spillover (e.g., Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria), relatively little is known

452

about the prevalence of LASV in rodents or humans in other regions (e.g., Togo, Benin,

453

Mali, Burkina Faso). Our model suggests that Lassa virus infections occur regularly in

454

these under-sampled areas. Human serosurveys and rodent LASV testing from these

455

regions could help modeling approaches clarify the spatial distribution of Lassa fever

456

across West Africa.

457

In addition to identifying the regions most at risk for viral emergence, our model

458

framework provides updated estimates for the rate of LASV spillover across West Africa.

459

Previous estimates of 100,000 – 300,000 infections per year were based on longitudinal

460

studies from communities in Sierra Leone conducted in the 1980s [17]. Using

461

seroprevalence data from studies across West Africa, our model predicts between

462

897,700 – 4,383,600 LASV infections in humans occur each year. As demonstrated by

463

past research focused on estimating LASV infection in humans, where the true value lies

464

within this range depends on whether or not seroreversion and subsequent LASV

465

reinfection are regular features of human LASV epidemiology, and therefore reinforces

466

the need to better understand the scope for LASV reinfection [72]. It is important to

467

realize that our predictions include both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.

468

Thus, because many human LASV infections result in mild flu-like symptoms or are

469

asymptomatic, it is unsurprising that our predicted values exceed the reported number

470

of confirmed LF cases in Nigeria [73, 74]. Several factors may contribute to the

471

discrepancy between previous estimates of LASV spillover, and our revised estimates.

472

McCormick et al. (1987) used seroconversion data from a 15 month period to infer a

473

rate of LASV infection across West Africa. However, the population of West Africa has

February 18, 2021

increased by a factor of 2.4 since that time, making these estimates outdated [75].

475

Furthermore, our estimates are based on human seroprevalence data that comes from

476

five countries in West Africa and spans a 45 year time period. Because our dataset was

477

obtained from a broader spatial and temporal range, our estimates are less likely to be

478

biased by sporadic extremes in LASV spillover.

479

Accurate risk predictions could help guide risk-reduction and behavior-change

480

communication campaigns, the distribution of future human LASV vaccines, and

481

countermeasures directed at the rodent reservoir. In addition to vaccines that prevent

482

infection in humans, new vaccine designs are currently being investigated for various

483

wildlife pathogens as well, including pathogens in rodents [76, 77]. Wildlife vaccination

484

campaigns that use vaccine baits have proven to be effective in the control of rabies in

485

red fox (Vulpes vulpes) over large land areas, but require substantial planning and

486

surveillance of the reservoir population [78]. Rodent population management could be

487

another method of attenuating the risk of LASV in an area. Pinpointing areas that are

488

most in need of spillover intervention will help overcome the logistical challenges that

489

are associated with vaccine distribution to humans or wildlife on large scales. In

490

addition to guiding intervention to specific regions, mechanistic forecasts similar to ours

491

could help plan the logistics of such operations.

492

Our framework sheds light on the connection between LASV spillover in humans and

493

the environmental conditions favorable to pathogen and reservoir. The reservoir layer of

494

our model identified strong seasonal trends in vegetation (NDVI) as the primary

495

explanatory variable that determines where the rodent M. natalensis occurs. This

496

builds on other work that identified properties of vegetation as important predictors of

497

the range of M. natalensis [5]. In conjunction with a strong seasonality of vegetation,

498

our model identified a range of mean and maximum rainfall values that limit the

499

distribution of the LASV reservoir. This is in line with previous ecological studies

500

showing that seasonal patterns of precipitation and vegetation are important drivers of

501

seasonal breeding in M. natalensis [79]. Our model indicates that M. natalensis do not

502

occur in areas associated with too much rainfall or areas without a clear wet/dry

503

seasonality, resulting in a lower risk of LASV spillover in coastal areas of West Africa

504

and southern Nigeria. The pathogen layer of our model also indicates that strong

505

seasonal precipitation patterns are the leading environmental feature that is associated

with LASV in M. natalensis and the main driver of the LASV’s occurrence in only

507

western and eastern West Africa. Though the mechanism by which rainfall affects viral

508

prevalence is unclear, it has been hypothesized, for example, that wetter conditions

509

might facilitate the virus’ ability to survive outside the host [4].

510

Our model of spillover risk predicts a significant, but small amount of the spatial

February 18, 2021

511

variation in arenavirus seroprevalence studies in humans. The modest relationship

512

between human LASV spillover and predicted risk might be due to the binary classifiers’

513

coarse description of the magnitude of LASV risk. As more longitudinal data become

514

available, these binary models can be upgraded with more nuanced models that predict

515

the time-varying density of M. natalensis and the prevalence of LASV among the

516

rodent population. Alternatively, the low correlation could indicate that other

517

predictors like human factors have a large influence on LASV spillover. Geographic

518

differences in housing, cultural practices, and diet likely influence the extent of LASV

519

spillover but are not included in our model. For instance, the use of rodent-proof

520

housing materials (e.g., concrete vs mud) and abstaining from rodent hunting and

521

consumption are known to affect the extent to which LASV is able to transmit between

522

rodents and humans [16, 80]. The residuals of seroprevalence predictions from our model

523

could help guide understanding of which human factors mitigate or facilitate LASV

524

spillover. If human factors like housing type can be readily identified from serosurvey

525

locations within West Africa, they could be incorporated in the human stage of the

526

model that connects spillover risk to human seroprevalence.

527

Geographic variation in LASV and its primary reservoir may also be responsible for

528

the modest fit of our model. For instance, across West Africa LASV consists of several

529

clades [22]. If certain clades are better at infecting humans, then our model will tend to

530

underestimate the rate of human infections in regions where such highly-infectious

531

clades occur. Similarly, the M. natalensis reservoir is also divided into multiple

532

clades [20]. Different M. natalensis clades may differ in their contact rates with humans

533

or in their suitability as reservoir, further reducing our model’s ability to predict

534

spillover into humans. Some evidence for this latter possibility comes from arenavirsues

535

that preferentially infect certain clades of M. natalensis [21]. Because our study region

536

only includes West Africa, it is likely that the M. natalensis occurrences that our model

537

is trained on are only from the A-I clade [20]. However, our forecast should be

interpreted with caution in eastern Nigeria, where the transition zone into the A-II

539

clade occurs. Future work integrating these factors may help improve our understanding

540

of the spatial variation in human seroprevalence that is due to the spatial patterning of

541

LASV and reservoir clades.

542

Another factor that could influence our model fit is the possibility that rodent
species other than M. natalensis serve as reservoirs or interact with the primary

544

reservoir in ways that decrease or increase risk. Though M. natalensis is believed to be

545

the primary reservoir that contributes to human infection, several species of rodents are

546

known to be capable of harboring the virus [48]. Understanding the relationship

547

between the habitat suitability of different rodent reservoirs and human LF burden may

548

help determine whether M. natalensis is the host at which intervention strategies should

549

always be directed. Furthermore, other species of rodent may displace M. natalensis

550

and therefore lower the overall spillover risk of LASV into humans. The layered

551

framework we have developed can be easily adapted to include additional reservoir

552

species and systematically investigate these possibilities.

553

Our model is constructed to learn and explain spatial variation in the average

554

historical spillover of LASV, and does not include temporal trends of spillover risk. Due

555

to the sparsity of available longitudinal data, our model assumes that the human

556

population in West Africa, human LASV seroprevalence, and the rate of LASV spillover,

557

are all constant in time. Over decades-long timescales, the rate of LASV spillover is

558

likely increasing due to increasing rates of human-rodent interaction that come with

559

urban growth, deforestation, or climate change [11, 70]. Estimating the combined

560

temporal and spatial variation of infection will require long-term longitudinal studies in

561

both rodents and humans across West Africa. With this data, for example, more

562

advanced models could mechanistically associate an increasing rate of spillover with

563

changes to land cover.

564

Another important temporal simplification of our current modeling work is the

February 18, 2021

543

565

absence of seasonality in LASV spillover. In Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria, hospital

566

admissions attributable to LASV infection generally peak late in the dry

567

season [54, 69, 81]. In these regions, the mechanism of seasonal spillover likely involves a

568

combination of seasonal rainfall and land use practices, such as crop-harvesting and

569

subsequent burning of agricultural fields, that drive rodents into domestic dwellings in

February 18, 2021

search of food-stuffs [54, 82]. It is not understood whether these factors operate

571

uniformly across all of West Africa. Temporal fluctuations in the density of the reservoir

572

population, due to seasonal cycles of reproduction, are another potentially important

573

factor that could drive a seasonal spike of human LF cases. However, it is unclear

574

whether the density fluctuations that have been observed outside of the LASV

575

geographic range (e.g., Tanzania [79]) also occur within West Africa. At least in Guinea

576

and Sierra Leone, research on the population dynamics of M. natalensis indicates that

577

density fluctuations are much weaker than those in East Africa [83]. In the case of

578

rodent vaccination, understanding population dynamics is particularly important

579

because distributing vaccines at seasonal population lows in wildlife demographic cycles

580

can, in theory, substantially increase the probability of pathogen elimination [83, 84].

581

Although the methods we have used here make efficient use of available data, the

582

accuracy of our risk forecasts remains difficult to rigorously evaluate due to the limited

583

availability of current data from human populations across West Africa. The sparseness

584

of modern human data arises for two reasons: 1) the lack of robust surveillance and

585

testing across much of the region where LASV is endemic and 2) the absence of publicly

586

available databases reporting human cases in those countries that do have relatively

587

robust surveillance in place (i.e., Nigeria). Improving surveillance for LASV across West

588

Africa and developing publicly available resources for sharing the resulting data would

589

allow more robust risk predictions to be developed and facilitate risk reducing

590

interventions. Despite these limitations of existing data, the structured

591

machine-learning models we develop here provide insight into what aspects of

592

environment, reservoir, and virus, contribute to spillover, and the potential risk of

593

subsequent emergence into the human population. By understanding these connections,

594

we can design and deploy more effective intervention and surveillance strategies that

595

work in tandem to reduce disease burden and enhance global health security.
