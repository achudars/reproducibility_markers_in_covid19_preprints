ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal
symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to
develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to
viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection
model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune
response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestineon-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal
epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and
vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel
lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS
membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARSCoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and
obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed
distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (Ecadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal
barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell
morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin).
Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well
as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral
infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B
signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the
human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level,
which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising
tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a global epidemic. As of late August
2020, it has caused 22 million infections and more than 790,000 deaths. SARS-CoV-2
infection is characterized by a process ranging from mild disease to severe systemic
symptoms of multiple organs, most notably the lung, gastronintestinal tract, etc., and
finally multi-organ failure (1). Respiratory symptoms dominate the clinical
manifestations of COVID-19, yet obvious gastrointestinal symptoms were observed
in 20% to 50% of patients, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia and
even intestinal perforation (2-5). In particular, these symptoms sometimes appear
before the onset of respiratory symptoms (6). In addition, biopsy samples showed a
large number of interstitial edema plasma cells and lymphocytes infiltrated into
lamina propria of the stomach, duodenum and rectum (7). It has been reported that

SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute hemorrhagic colitis, providing the evidence of the
gastrointestinal tract implicating in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection (8).
Moreover, the viral RNA was identified in stool samples of COVID-19 patients and
typical coronavirus virions in rectal tissue were observed under electron microscopy,
implying that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be transmitted via the fecal-oral route
(9-11). These clinical evidences suggest that intestine represents another high-risk
organ for SARS-CoV-2 infection besides the lungs, but the pathogenesis of intestinal
infection underlying COVID-19 is elusive.
In vivo, human intestine contains complex multicellular components and hostpathogen interactions in a physiological flow microenvironment with mechanical
cues. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 infection in intestine is studied based on monolayer
cultures of intestinal epithelial cells (12, 13) and human organoids (14, 15). However,
these in vitro models still have their limitations. The monolayer cell culture is
oversimplified and cannot recapitulate the multiple cellular component, complex
structure and functions of native intestine. Moreover, they lack cell-cell/matrix
interactions and tissue-specific dynamic microenvironment that exist in vivo.
Recently, intestinal organoids have provided a new in vitro 3D model for SARS-CoV2 infection by providing multiple cell types and supporting viral replication in the gut
enterocytes (14). But these organoids are still limited by the lack of typical
characteristics of intestinal barrier, ECM, immune cells and physiological flow, which
are key features of the intestinal microenvironment. As such, it is highly desirable to
develop alternative in vitro models to better reflect the pathophysiology of human
organs to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Organ-on-a-chip technology has evolved to provide the possibility to reproduce the
complex structures and physiological functions units of human organs in engineered
microfluidic culture device (16-18). It has been utilized to represent the organ-level
physiology and pathology, and applied in various biomedical applications, including
organ engineering, disease studies and drug testing (19-23). In this work, we
established a perfusable intestine infection model on chip system that simulate the
human-relevant intestine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at organ level. The
microengineered intestine chip device consists of human intestine epithelium layer
and vascular endothelium layer separated by an ECM coated porous PDMS
membrane, in which Caco-2 cells and HT-29 cells are co-cultured in the upper
channel, while HUVEC cells and circulating immune cells are lined in the lower
channel under fluid flow. Using this system, we examined the infection and
replication of SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells. We then systematically analyzed the
changes of intestinal epithelium and endothelium induced by virus infection using
confocal imaging. We also characterized the pathological changes and immune
responses of intestinal barrier after viral infection via RNA-sequencing analysis. This

human disease model on chip offers a novel strategy and platform for organ-level
COVID-19 research and potential therapeutics.

RESULTS
Characterization of human intestine-on-chip device
In vivo, human intestinal epithelium is a cell monolayer that constitutes the intestinal
barrier, which allows the mucus secretion, absorption of nutrients and prevents the
invasion of pathogenic antigen or toxins in a dynamic microenvironment. In order to
create an in vitro human model of intestine infection induced by SARS-CoV-2, we
initially designed and constructed an intestine chip in a perfusable multilayer
microfluidic culture device. Briefly, the device consists of two parallel channels
separated by a thin and porous PDMS membrane coated with ECM to form biointerface and facilitate the nutrient exchange between upper and lower cell layers.
In this work, the intestine epithelial cells Caco-2 and intestinal mucin secreting
cells HT-29 were co-cultured to build intestinal epithelium in the upper channel under
fluid flow (200 μL/h) to simulate the intraluminal fluid flow in intestine. The HUVEC
cells were cultured in the lower channel to form vascular endothelium under fluid
flow (50 μL/h). After 3 days of co-culture, the intestine epithelial and endothelial cells
were confluent into monolayers under fluid flow, thus forming an intestine
epithelium-endothelium tissue barrier. The integrity of the epithelial barrier was
identified by assessing the expression of tight junction (ZO-1) and adherent junction
(E-cadherin) proteins. The immunostaining analysis showed the positive expression
of ZO-1 and E-cadherin in epithelium (Fig. 2A). In particular, the epithelial cells
formed villus-like structure lined by a highly polarized columnar epithelium identified
by DIC imaging, which was similar to in vivo intestinal villi (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the
integrity of endothelium was examined by ZO-1 and VE-cadherin immunostaining,
showing the regular and intact distribution of junction proteins (Fig. 2B). As the
intestinal mucus layer is the crucial interface between the host and microbes, which
plays a vital role in preventing microbial invasion (24). We examined the mucus
production in intestinal epithelium by immunostaining with mucin specific marker
(MUC). As shown in Fig. 2D, it exhibited a scattered distribution of MUC positive
cells in the intestinal epithelium, suggesting the secretory function of mucus. It
appears that the established intestine chip system exhibited intestinal villus-like
structure, the integrity of tissue barrier and ability of mucus secretion under fluidic
flow, representing the key features of human intestinal barrier in a physiologically
relevant manner.
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the intestine-on-chip

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this

Prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection on the intestine chip, we first detected the expression
level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in three cell lines by western blot, including Caco-2,
HT-29 and HUVEC cells. It is recognized that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor
for cellular entry and TMPRSS2 protease for viral Spike protein priming (25, 26). The
intestinal enterocytes have a higher expression of ACE2 compared to alveolar
epithelial type II cells (27-29). Among the tested three cell lines in this work, ACE2
and TMPRSS2 were expressed at the highest level in Caco-2 cells (Fig. S1A), which
implied that Caco-2 cells may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Caco-2
cells were then inoculated with different multiplicity of virus (MOI=0.04, 0.4 and 2)
to identify the virus susceptibility. Three days after infection, immunostaining data
showed more than 80% Spike protein-positive cells were observed in Caco-2 cells at
MOI of 2 (Fig. S1B).
To examine the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the intestine chip, the virus was
inoculated into the intestinal channel at MOI=1 for 24h after co-culture of intestinal
epithelium and endothelium for 3 days. The virus infection in the intestinal epithelium
layer and endothelium layer were then examined by immunostaining analysis. The
data showed that Spike positive cells were predominantly detected on the intestinal
layer, indicating that the intestinal epithelial cells are more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection than endothelial cells (Fig. 3).
In vivo, the development and barrier maintenance of intestine depends heavily on
the proper function of adherent junctions, we further examined the adherent junctions
of intestinal epithelium and endothelium, respectively. Confocal micrographs of
intestinal epithelium showed that on day 3 after viral infection, the adherent junction
identified by E-cadherin was severely destroyed, accompanied by the damage of
intestinal villus-like structures (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the mucous secreting cells in
intestinal epithelium were examined by immunostaining with MUC2. The results
showed that the clonal distribution MUC2+ cells became dispersed after viral infection
(Fig. 4A). This suggests that the disturbed intestinal mucus layer was caused by viral
infection, which may lead to virus encroachment and infection. It is noted that, in the
vascular side, the adherent junctions between endothelial cells were severely
disrupted by VE-cadherin immunostaining (Fig. 4B). Quantitative analysis showed
that the density and size of endothelial cells were significantly decreased (Fig. 4C
and 4D). It reveals the injury of vascular endothelial cells following viral infection,
while there were no obvious Spike positive cells on the vascular side. The presence of
endothelial injury might partially explain the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated
coagulopathy or vascular thrombosis (30).
Transcriptional analysis of host cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection
To gain a comprehensive overview of transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2
infection, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis of intestinal epithelial cells and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this

endothelial cells in human intestine model. Briefly, 3 days after infection, intestinal
epithelial cells and endothelial cells were collected separately and analyzed by RNAsequencing. Volcano plots showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced dramatic
transcriptome modulations in both intestinal epithelial cells and endothelial cells (Fig.
5A). In order to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the critical value and
P value of the abundance fold change were set to 2.0 and 0.05, respectively. Among
the DEGs, 9684 genes (4022 down-regulated genes and 5662 up-regulated genes)
were significantly modulated in intestinal epithelial cells, while 6713 genes (2569
down-regulated genes and 4144 up-regulated genes) were significantly modulated in
endothelial cells following viral infection. This result suggested that SARS-CoV-2
infection had a greater effect on intestinal epithelial cells than endothelial cells,
possibly due to higher viral load in intestinal epithelium. By combining the two data
sets, we found that intestinal epithelial cells and endothelial cells shared 1791
overlapping up-regulated DEGs (37.3% of total up-regulated DEGs) and 3317
overlapping down-regulated DEGs (51.5% of total down-regulated DEGs) (Fig. 5B).
To investigate the host biological pathways modified by SARS-CoV-2 infection,
KEGG pathway enrichments analysis comparing mock-infected versus SARS-CoV-2
infected intestine chips was performed (Fig. 5C and 5D). The results revealed that the
viral infection resulted in the abnormal pathway networks in both cell types, including
RNA metabolism pathways (e.g., spliceosome, RNA transport, RNA degradation,
mRNA surveillance pathway) and protein metabolism pathways (e.g., ubiquitin
mediated proteolysis, protein export). Given the vital roles of RNA and protein
metabolism in maintaining the normal physiological functions of cells, we reasoned
that SARS-CoV-2 may seriously affect the host cells by disrupting these critical
pathways. In addition, we found that some immune responses related pathways, such
as TNF signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway, were particularly
enriched in genes that are significantly up-regulated in endothelial cells, which
indicated that the intestinal endothelial cells play critical roles in mediating intestinal
immune responses.
Immune response of intestinal model on chip to SARS-CoV-2 infection
According to the above transcriptional analysis, the KEGG pathway enrichment
analysis indicated some immune response-related signaling pathways were activated
following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then tried to identify the up-regulated cytokine
genes that mediated the subsequent inflammatory responses underlying SARS-CoV2-induced intestinal infection. The heat map showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection
elicited an extensive cytokines induction in both intestinal epithelium and
endothelium, including TNF, interleukins, chemokines and colony-stimulating factors
in both intestinal epithelial cells and endothelial cells (Fig. 6A and 6B). Notably, in
this infected intestinal model, some cytokines including TNF, IL-6, CXCL10, CCL5

and CSF3 were significantly up-regulated, which is similar to the clinical
manifestations of patients with severe COVID-19 (31, 32). These results may partially
explain the presence of infiltrated immune cells and inflammatory response in the
intestine of patients with severe COVID-19.
Then, we further detected the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines-related genes in the intestinal epithelial cells by qRT-PCR. The
expression of CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10 and CXCL11 were significantly up-regulated
in the SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells (Fig. 6C). The data indicated that
chemokine genes could be induced by SARS-CoV-2, which may play a crucial role in
the recruitment of immune cells and modulation of immune response to virus
infection. It has been previously reported that chemokines CCL5 can recruit T cells,
dendritic cells, eosinophils, NK cells, mast cells, and basophils (33), CXCL1 recruits
neutrophils (34), CXCL10 recruits activated Th1 lymphocytes (35), and CXCL11
recruits interleukin-activated T-cells (36) to sites of inflammation. This might provide
the clues to further identify which immune cells are involved in the intestinal
inflammatory responses in the progression of COVID-19.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we created a biomimetic human disease model of intestinal infection on
chip by SARS-CoV-2, which could mirror the pathophysiological features and
immune response associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19. This in
vitro model can reflect the damage of the intestinal epithelial barrier, including the
destruction of intestinal villi, the disruption of barrier integrity, mucosal secretion
disorder and activated immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may
help us to understand the pathological processes involved in COVID-19. Moreover,
despite the low susceptibility to virus infection, the vascular endothelium displayed
significant morphological damage induced by SARS-CoV-2, revealing the possible
complex cross-talk between intestine epithelial cells and endothelial cells in
mediating tissue barrier injury and COVID-19 progression.
In vivo, human intestine comprises the largest component of human immune system
with large populations of scattered innate and adaptive effector cells, because it is
constantly exposed to foreign antigens and other environmental agents. The protective
mucus gel secreted by goblet cells is distributed on the gastrointestinal epithelium,
which provides chemical and physical defenses for the intestinal barrier and plays a
crucial role in intestinal homeostasis. In this intestine chip, the Caco-2 cells and
mucin secreting HT-29 cells were co-cultured under continuous perfusion to form
intestinal epithelium, which can recapitulate the intestinal barrier in a highly
physiological relevant manner. In particular, we found that the secretion of intestinal

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this

mucin has undergone unrecognized changes, from agglomerated distribution to
scattered distribution after viral infection. It is speculated that the disturbed mucus
layer may be associated with further invasion and infection of virus. These results
may also explain the increased intestinal permeability and further cause symptoms,
such as diarrhea6 and hemorrhagic colitis (37) in COVID-19 patients.
Transcriptome analysis demonstrated significantly altered vital biological processes
in both intestinal epithelium and endothelium following SARS-CoV-2 infection,
including RNA and protein metabolism pathways, cell cycle regulation and oxidative
phosphorylation. Specifically, we identified many up-regulated cytokine and
chemokine-related genes in the intestinal epithelial cells, similar to the clinical
manifestations of COVID-19. Because chemokine can act as chemoattractant to
recruit immune cells to the infected sites, these altered chemokines may contribute to
the immune cells mediated inflammatory responses in the intestine. In addition, we
found that the intestinal epithelium is more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than
endothelium on chip, which is consistent with previous studies (12). As such, we
assume that the vascular endothelial injury may be mediated by the inflammatory
factors or paracrine signals released by virus infected intestinal epithelial cells.
One potential limitation of this work is the use of immortalized intestinal epithelial
cell lines (e.g., Caco-2) originally isolated from human colon tumors. However, Caco2 cells have been widely used to recapitulate many physiological and pathological
functions of human intestine in vivo (38, 39). The intestinal epithelium differentiated
from primary intestinal stem cells may be selected for further studies in later time.
Overall, in this work, we provide the proof-of-concept to build an intestine-on-chip
infection model at organ-level that permits to closely mirror the intestinal
pathophysiology and human response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is impossible
to achieve by existing in vitro culture models. It can not only supply a unique, rapid
and low-cost in vitro platform for viral infection, but also provide a complement to
animal models to study disease progress, virus transmission and host-virus
interactions in a more realistic manner, thereby accelerating the COVID-19 research
and development of novel therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Device fabrication
The human intestine model consisted of the upper and lower layers fabricated by
using conventional soft lithography procedures. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer was prepared by mixing 10:1 (wt/wt) PDMS base to curing agent (184
Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning Corp) and casted on molds to produce molded
device with channels by thermal curing at 80 °C for 45 min. The channels were 1.5
mm wide × 0.25 mm high and the length of overlapping channels was 8 mm. The two
channels were separated by a thin (~20 m) through-hole PDMS membrane (pore
size: 5 μm) to construct tissue-tissue interfaces. The porous PDMS membranes were
fabricated based on the glass templates and spin-coating method modified from the
previous protocol. The membrane was sandwiched in the intestine-on-chip device by
oxygen plasma bonding. Finally, the devices were exposed to ultraviolet light for
disinfection and sterilization. Prior to cell seeding, both sides of the porous membrane
were coated with rat tail collagen type I (200 μg/mL, Corning) and incubated at 37 °C
for 48 h.
Cell culture
Human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) were cultured in high-glucose
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal
Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco). Human colorectal adenocarcinoma grade II cells HT29
were purchased from Procell Life Science＆Technology Co., Ltd (Procell, CL-0118)
and were maintained in growth medium (Procell, CM-0118) supplemented with 10%
FBS. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from human
umbilical cord and cultured in Endothelial Cell Medium purchased from ScienCell
Research Laboratories, inc. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated
from fresh human blood using Ficoll (Stem cell technologies) density centrifugation.
Isolated PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and
50 IU/mL IL-2 and used for adhesion assays on chip. All cells were cultured at 37 °C
in a humidified atmosphere of5% CO2.To create the intestine model, HUVEC cells (~
1×105 cells) were initially seeded on the bottom side of the collagen-coated porous
PDMS membrane and allowed to attach on the membrane surface under static
conditions for two hours. Subsequently, cells were washed with fresh medium to
exclude/remove unattached ones. Then, Caco-2 cells (~ 1×105 cells) and HT29 cells
(~ 1×104 cells) were mixed and seeded into the upper channel under static cultures.
After cell attachment, cells were grown to confluence for 3 days and the chips were
maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Virus

A clinical isolate SARS-COV-2 strain 107 was obtained from Guangdong Provincial
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, and propagated in Vero E6 cells.
The virus titers were (infectious titers of virus) were determined by a TCID50 assay
on Vero cells. All work involving live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention-approved BSL-3 laboratory of the
Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science.
SARS-CoV-2 infection
Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2×105 cells per well) in high-glucose
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 10% FBS. After seeding for 24h,
cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an indicated multiplicity of virus
(MOI=0.04, 0.4 and 2). After one hour, cells were washed three times with PBS and
kept in fresh medium for 3 days. At day 3 post-infection, cells were washed with PBS
and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) before analysis.
For SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human intestine model, the apical channel of
chip device was infused with 30 L of high-glucose DMEM medium containing the
indicated multiplicity of virus (MOI=1). After one hour of infection, cells were
washed three times with PBS and kept in fresh medium. At day 3 post-infection, the
epithelial cells and endothelial cells cultured on chip were fixed for
immunofluorescence analysis or lysed for RNA- sequencing analysis, respectively.
Immunostaining
Caco-2 cells cultured on well plate were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA at
4℃ overnight. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST
buffer) for 5 min and blocked with PBST buffer containing 5% normal goat serum for
30 minutes at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted with PBST buffer. Cells
were stained with corresponding primary antibodies at 4℃ overnight and with
secondary antibodies (supplementary Table S1) at room temperature for 1hour. After
staining with secondary antibodies, cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. For
immunofluorescent imaging of intestine model, cells were washed with PBS through
the upper and bottom channels and fixed with 4% PFA. The fixed tissues were
subjected to immunofluorescence staining by the same procedure as described above.
All images were acquired using a confocal fluorescent microscope system (FV-1000,
Olympus). Image processing was done using ImageJ (NIH).
RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing
Intestinal epithelial cells and endothelial cells were collected separately from the
chips, and total RNAs were extracted from samples using Trizol (Invitrogen). DNA
digestion was carried out after RNA extraction by DNaseI. RNA quality was
determined by examining A260/A280 with NanodropTM OneCspectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc). RNA Integrity was confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel

electrophoresis. Qualified RNAs were finally quantified by Qubit3.0 with QubitTM
RNA Broad Range Assay kit (Life Technologies). 500 ng total RNAs were used for
stranded RNA sequencing library preparation using KC-DigitalTM Stranded mRNA
Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (Catalog NO. DR08502, Wuhan SeqHealth Co., Ltd.
China) following the manufacturer’s instruction. The kit eliminates duplication bias in
PCR and sequencing steps, by using unique molecular identifier (UMI) of 8 random
bases to label the pre-amplified cDNA molecules. The library products corresponding
to 200-500 bps were enriched, quantified and finally sequenced on Hiseq X 10
sequencer (Illumina).
RNA-sequencing analysis
Raw sequencing data was first filtered by Trimmomatic (version 0.36), low-quality
reads were discarded and the reads contaminated with adaptor sequences were
trimmed. Clean Reads were further treated with in-house scripts to eliminate
duplication bias introduced in library preparation and sequencing. In brief, clean reads
were first clustered according to the UMI sequences, in which reads with the same
UMI sequence were grouped into the same cluster, resulting in 65,536 clusters. Reads
in the same cluster were compared to each other by pairwise alignment, and then
reads with sequence identity over 95% were extracted to a new sub-cluster. After all
sub-clusters were generated, multiple sequence alignment was performed to get one
consensus sequence for each sub-cluster. After these steps, any errors and biases
introduced by PCR amplification or sequencing were eliminated.
The de-duplicated consensus sequences were used for standard RNA-sequencing
analysis. They were mapped to the reference genome of Homo sapiens from Ensembl
database (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-87/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/) using STAR
software (version 2.5.3a) with default parameters. Reads mapped to the exon regions
of each gene were counted by featureCounts (Subread-1.5.1; Bioconductor) and then
RPKMs were calculated. Genes differentially expressed between groups were
identified using the edgeR package (version 3.12.1). An FDR corrected p-value cutoff
of 0.05 and Fold-change cutoff of 2 were used to judge the statistical significance of
gene expression differences. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of
genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes
were both implemented by KOBAS software (version: 2.1.1) with a corrected P-value
cutoff of 0.05 to judge statistically significant enrichment.
Statistical analyses
Data were collected in Excel (Microsoft). Differences between two groups were
analyzed using a Student’s t-test. Multiple group comparisons were performed using a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc tests. The bar graphs
