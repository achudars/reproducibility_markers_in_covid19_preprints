There is an urgent need for new treatments to prevent and ameliorate severe
illness and death induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. The
coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 causes pneumonitis in mice which
shares many pathological characteristics with human SARS-CoV infection.
Previous studies have shown that the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) has anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether oral treatment with
GABA could modulate the MHV-1 induced pneumonitis in susceptible A/J mice.
As expected, MHV-1-inoculated control mice became severely ill (as measured by
weight loss, clinical score, and the ratio of lung weight to body weight) and >60%
of them succumbed to the infection. In contrast, mice that received GABA
immediately after MHV-1 inoculation became only mildly ill and all of them
recovered. When GABA treatment was initiated after the appearance of illness (3
days post-MHV-1 infection), we again observed that GABA treatment significantly
reduced the severity of illness and greatly increased the frequency of recovery.
Therefore, the engagement of GABA receptors (GABA-Rs) prevented the MHV-1
infection-induced severe pneumonitis and death in mice. Given that GABA-R
agonists, like GABA and homotaurine, are safe for human consumption, stable,
inexpensive, and available worldwide, they are promising candidates to help
prevent severe illness stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection and other
coronavirus strains.

While GABA is well known as a neurotransmitter that is commonly used in the
central nervous system, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that many immune cells
express GABA-Rs. The biological roles of GABA-Rs on immune cells are not yet well
understood, but there is a growing body of evidence that the activation of these
receptors generally has immunoregulatory actions. In the innate immune system,
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) express GABA-A-type receptors (GABAA-Rs) which
form a chloride channel and their activation reduces APC reactivity (1, 2). Neutrophils
express GABA-B-type receptors (GABAB-Rs) which are G-protein coupled receptors
that modulate their function (3). In the CNS, microglia express both GABAA-Rs and
GABAB-Rs and their activation reduces microglia responsiveness to inflammatory
stimuli (4). Alveolar macrophages express GABAA-Rs and application of a GABAA-Rspecific agonist decreases the expression of many pro-inflammatory molecules in
cultures of LPS-stimulated lung macrophages (5). In the adaptive immune system, we
have shown that GABA-R activation promotes effector T cell cycle arrest without
inducing apoptosis (6). In vivo, administration of GABA, or the GABAA-R-specific
agonist homotaurine, inhibits autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells while promoting CD4+
and CD8+ Treg responses (7-9). Taking advantage of these properties, we have
demonstrated that administration of GABA or homotaurine inhibits disease progression
in mouse models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis,
and limits inflammation in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (1, 6, 8-10).
There is an urgent need to develop new treatments to reduce severe illness and
death in COVID-19 patients. Patients who develop severe illness appear to mount
weaker and delayed innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which leads to
excessive adaptive immune responses later that do not taper off appropriately (11-13).
This can lead to “cytokine storms”, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and death. Studies of anti-CD3-activated human
PBMC have shown that GABA inhibits IL-6, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL4, CCL20, and MCP-3
production (14). Longitudinal studies of COVID-19 patients reveal that high levels of
serum IL-6 and Th1, Th17, and Th2-secreted proteins are associated with progression
to severe illness (11, 15). Many of these biomarkers of severe illness have been shown
to be reduced by GABA-R agonists in the aforementioned in vitro studies of human

PBMC and/or mouse models of autoimmune disease. Currently, however, there is no
information on whether GABA treatment modulates the outcome of viral infections.
Like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 is a
pneumotropic beta-coronavirus of the group 2 lineage and is widely used as a safe
model of SARS-CoV infection (16-19). MHV-1 infection creates a lethal pneumonitis,
similar to SARS-CoV-induced disease, in A/J mice. Intranasal inoculation with 5000
plaque-forming units (PFU) of MHV-1 in A/J mice induces an acute respiratory distress
syndrome with a high lethality rate. The infected mice develop pathological features of
SARS-CoV-2, including high levels of pulmonary cytokines/chemokines, pneumonitis,
dense macrophage infiltrates, hyaline membranes, fibrin deposits, accompanied by loss
of body weights and respiratory distress (16-19).
We studied whether oral GABA treatment beginning at the time of MHV-1
inoculation or starting three days post-inoculation (by which time signs of illness are
apparent), could modulate the severity of the ensuing illness and the rate of death

Materials and methods
Mice. Female A/J mice (7 weeks in age) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory
and maintained in microisolator cages and fed with a standard diet and water ad libitum.
One week after arrival, they were inoculated with MHV-1. The mice were immediately
randomized and treated (or not treated) with GABA, as described below. This study was
carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocols for all
experiments using vertebrate animals were approved by the Animal Research
Committee at UCLA.
Reagents. GABA was purchased from Millipore-Sigma (stock # A2129, St. Louis, MO,
USA).
Virus. MHV-1, DBT cells, and HeLa-CECAM1 were generously provided by Dr. Stanley
Perlman (University of Iowa). MHV-I virus was prepared and titered as previously
described (16-19).

Viral infection and GABA treatment. At 8 weeks in age, female A/J mice were
anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 5000 PFU MHV-1 in 50 µl cold Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). The mice were immediately randomized and
provided with plain water (controls) or water that contained GABA (20 mg/ml) for the
entirety of the observation period. Another group of MHV-1 inoculated mice received
plain water for three days, by which time they displayed signs of illness, and then were
placed on GABA-containing water for the rest of the observation period. We monitored
their body weights daily beginning on the day of infection and up to 14 days postinfection.
Illness scoring. Individual mice were monitored for illness development and progression
which were scored on the following scale: 0) no symptoms, 1) slightly ruffled fur and
altered hind limb posture; 2 ruffled fur and mildly labored breathing; 3) ruffled fur,

inactive, moderately labored breathing; 4) ruffled fur, obviously labored breathing and
lethargy; 5) moribund and death.
The percent survival of each group of mice was determined longitudinally for each
group. Mice with a disease score of 5 were weighed, euthanized, and their lungs
removed and weighed for calculation of lung coefficient index (the ratio of lung weight to
total body weight, which reflects the extent of edema and inflammation in the lungs). On
day 14 post-infection, the surviving animals were weighed, euthanized, and their lungs
were removed and weighed for determination of the lung coefficient index.

Results and Discussion
Following MHV-1 inoculation, the mice receiving plain water began to progressively lose
body weight each day. By day 6, this control group had lost an average of 23% of their
weights, as expected (16-19). At this time point, the mice that had been given GABA
immediately after MHV-1 infection had lost an average of 11% of their body weights,
and those given GABA three days after infection had lost an average of 17% of their
body weights (Fig. 1A). After day 6, the mice in the control group began to succumb to
their illness and only 3/9 mice survived to day 14 post-infection (Fig. 1B). In contrast,
none of the mice given GABA starting immediately after MHV-1 inoculation died (Fig.
1B), and their body weight was on average only 7% below their starting weights 14 days
post-infection (Fig. 1A). Of the mice that began GABA treatment 3 days post-infection,
1/9 mice died (on day 9), and their body weights at 14 days post-infection were 90% of
their starting weight. The survival curves for each group are shown in Fig. 1B.
In terms of illness, MHV-1 infected control mice began to display signs of illness two
days post-infection and rapidly became severely ill thereafter, with their illness peaking
around day 7 post-infection. While most control mice died between days 6-11 postinfection, those that survived displayed only partial recovery from illness. In contrast, the
mice receiving GABA immediately after MHV-1 inoculation developed only mild illness,
with the highest average illness score of 1.6 on day 7 post-infection. Illness in the mice
given GABA at 3 days post-infection was also significantly reduced compared to that in
the control group, and their maximum mean illness score was 2.5. Thus, GABA
treatment immediately after MHV-1 infection, or 3 days later when the clinical signs of
the disease were apparent, reduced the subsequent severity of the disease and the
death rate.
The lung coefficient index reflects the edema and inflammation in the lung. The lung
coefficient index of mice that were given GABA immediately after MHV-1 infection was
49% of that of control mice (p<0.001). The mice receiving GABA treatment beginning 3
days post-infection had a lung coefficient index that was 62% of that in the control mice

(p<0.01). This provides an independent measure indicating that GABA treatment limited
the MHV-1 induced pulmonary edema and inflammation in A/J mice.
Together, the reduction in body weight loss, illness scores, death rate, and lung
coefficient index indicate that GABA treatment can reduce illness severity and death
rate following coronavirus infection, even when the treatment is initiated after symptoms
appear.
Since weaker and delayed early immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are
associated with more severe illness in COVID-19 patients (11) and GABA has antiinflammatory effects, we anticipated that treatment with GABA immediately after MHV-1
infection might be deleterious by limiting or delaying innate immune responses. We
were surprised that early GABA treatment immediately after MHV-1 infection was very
effective in preventing illness progression and death, suggesting a rapid effect of GABA
on innate immune responses and/or the lung airway cells. The lung epithelial cells of
mice and humans also express GABAA-Rs (20, 21). It is possible that the activation of
these GABAA-Rs leads to Cl- efflux, which would act to limit Ca2+ influx in these
epithelial cells. Because many viruses, including coronaviruses, elevate intracellular
Ca2+ concentrations in order to enhance viral replication (22, 23), the activation of
GABAA-Rs may have limited MHV-1 replication, a possibility that we are currently
investigating.
Additionally, treatment with GABA, a GABAB-agonist, or GABAA-R positive allosteric
modulators can reduce inflammation and improve alveolar fluid clearance and lung
functional recovery in rodent models of acute lung injury (24-28). Whether these
capabilities contributed to GABA’s ability to limit the progression of pneumonitis soon
after MHV-1 infection is an open question. Thus, treatment with GABA-R agonists may
have multiple beneficial actions for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
GABA treatment was tested in hundreds of epilepsy patients for its ability to reduce
seizures (29-31). While it had no clinical benefit (probably because it cannot cross the

blood-brain barrier), it had no adverse effects in these long-term studies. A more recent
phase Ib GABA oral dosing study also indicated that GABA is safe (32) and there are
currently several ongoing clinical trials that are administering oral GABA to individuals
with T1D (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02002130, NCT03635437, NCT03721991,
NCT04375020). In addition, the GABAA-R specific agonist homotaurine was tested in a
large long-term phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer’s disease, and while it was not
effective it had an excellent safety record (see (8, 9) for a discussion of homotaurine’s
safety). Both GABA and homotaurine are inexpensive, stable at room temperature, and
available worldwide making them excellent candidates for clinical testing as adjunctive
treatments for COVID-19.
These studies indicate the potential usefulness of GABA and/or homotaurine as
a treatment for COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. However, until clinical trials
are completed and GABA and/or homotaurine are approved for use in the treatment of
COVID-19 by relevant governing bodies, GABA and homotaurine should not be
consumed by COVID-19 patients as they may pose health risks, such as dampening
beneficial immune or physiological responses.

Figure 1. GABA treatment reduces body weight loss and death rate in MHV-1
infected mice. Female A/J mice were inoculated with MHV-1 intranasally and
immediately placed on plain water (control, solid black line) or water containing 20
mg/ml GABA (GABA0, dashed blue line) or given plain water for 3 days post-infection
and then placed on water containing 20 mg/ml GABA (GABA3, orange dotted line) for
the remaining observation period. A) Daily changes in % body weights post-infection (%
of day 0), p<0.0001 and p=0.0008 for GABA0 and GABA3 (respectively) vs. control by
repeated measure ANOVA. (GABA0 vs. GABA3,p=0.175.) B) Daily percent of surviving
mice in each group, p=0.002 and p=0.01 for GABA0 and GABA3 vs. control, respectively
by log-rank test. (p=0.32 for GABA0 vs. GABA3) N=9 mice in the control group, 10 mice
in each GABA-treated group. Data shown are from two separate studies with 4-5
mice/group. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. the control.

Fig. 2. GABA treatment reduces illness scores in MHV-1 infected mice. The
animals described in Fig. 1 were scored daily for the severity of their illness as detailed
in Methods. Data shown are the mean clinical scores +/- SEM of each group from two
separate experiments. Overall p<0.001 for GABA0 and GABA3 vs. control. GABA0 vs.
GABA3 p=0.042 using the Kruskal-Wallis test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

Figure 3. GABA treatment reduces the lung coefficient index in MHV-1 infected
mice. The lungs were harvested and weighed when an animal became moribund or at
14 days post-infection. Data shown are the mean lung coefficient index ± SEM for each
group from two separate studies. ***p<0.001 and **p<0.01 for GABA0 and GABA3
(respectively) vs. control water treated group by Student’s t-test.
