Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a collective scientific effort to study its viral
causing agent SARS-CoV-2. Research is focusing in particular on its infection
mechanisms

and

on

the

associated-disease

symptoms.

Interestingly,

this

environmental pathogen directly affects the human chemosensory systems leading to
anosmia and ageusia. Evidence for the presence of the cellular entry sites of the virus,
the ACE2/TMPRSS2 proteins, has been reported in non-chemosensory cells in the
rodent’s nose and mouth, missing a direct correlation between the symptoms reported
in patients and the observed direct viral infection in human sensory cells. Here,
mapping the gene and protein expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the mouse olfactory
and gustatory cells, we precisely identified the virus target cells to be of basal and
sensory origin and we revealed their age-dependent appearance. Our results not only
clarify human viral-induced sensory symptoms but also propose new investigative
perspectives based on ACE2-humanized mouse models.

Introduction
The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has federated worldwide scientific efforts
for understanding the viral epidemiological mechanisms of the coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) that causes this severe acute respiratory syndrome. In humans, the viral
syndrome is characterized by an increased mortality rate in aged and/or comorbidity
patients associated with the upper respiratory infection symptoms, such as severe
respiratory distress1-3. In addition to its major impact, COVID-19 is associated by its
direct alteration of human olfaction and gustation, in absence of substantial nasal
inflammation or coryzal signs, resulting to anosmia and ageusia in up to 77% of the
patients4-7. While these sensory symptoms are well established and intensely affect
everyday behaviors8,9, the precise related mechanisms remain elusive10.
The target cells of the virus share a molecular signature: the concomitant cellular
expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and of its facilitating
transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which plays a crucial role for the
interaction of viral spike proteins with the host cell11-13. Paradoxically, these entry sites
seem to be lacking in sensory cells14-18, while a direct SARS-CoV-2 contamination has
been observed both in humans and rodents19,20, requesting further investigations to
explain the sensory-associated symptoms21-24. Therefore, the characterization of the
animal model is necessary prior to its use to understand the causality underling the
viral-induced sensory symptoms.
The use of mice is indeed limited for epidemiological studies due to their absence of
hands, which, with aerosols, are the foremost passages of inter-individual viral
transmission25, as well as their published lack of SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-spike protein
affinity26,27. Nevertheless, the ease of production of genetically-modified mice and their
scientific availability, as well as their well-studied and specialized chemosensory

systems28-30, make them a valuable ally for the development of potential prophylactic
and protective treatments related to these sensory symptoms.
Thus, we aimed here at characterizing the potential viral entry sites across mouse
sensory systems. We found SARS-CoV-2 entry cells to be of different origins
depending on the sensory systems. In summary, the virus could target cells involved
in tissue regulation such as the supporting cells of the olfactory receptor neurons and
the regenerative basal cells but also, specifically, the chemosensory cells of both
gustatory and olfactory systems. We finally revealed that the emergence of viral entry
sites in sensory and basal cells only occurs with age, which could explain both, the
observed

Results
SARS-CoV-2 entry genes are differentially expressed in the mouse sensory
systems. Focusing on the mouse, where chemosensing takes place in different
sensory systems (Fig. 1a), we took advantage of our previous studies31-35 to first
assess their overall expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry sites. Interestingly, we
found a differential expression of the Ace2 and Tmprss2 transcripts (Fig. 1b). Ace2 is
strongly expressed in a specific area of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), the dorsal
part (MOED) which is directly exposed to the environment and specialized in sensing
volatile chemical cues14,15. Moreover, we observed a previously unreported expression
of Ace2, in the most rostral sensory subsystem, the Grueneberg ganglion (GG), mostly
implicated in volatile danger cues detection34-36 and in the circumvallate taste papilla
(CV) involved in water-soluble tastant perception29. Interestingly, this specific pattern
of Ace2 expression seems to be correlated with the mode of viral dissemination
(volatile suspensions of viral droplets25), as only a limited expression of Ace2 is found
in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and in the septal organ of Masera (SO), considered
to be implicated in pheromonal and retronasal communications via indirect and only
limited access to the environment30. Concerning the associated facilitating cleavage
protease, we found that the Tmprss2 transcript was expressed in all olfactory
subsystems and to a limited extent at the CV level (Fig. 1b). Thus, this apparent
disparity of expression requires further investigations to identify the precise cells
expressing these entry sites in the different mouse subsystems.

SARS-CoV-2 entry cells in the MOED are of non-neuronal and multipotent types.
Taking advantage of a genetically modified mouse model in which, the olfactory marker
protein37 (OMP) drives the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in all
mature olfactory neurons38,39, we first examined the MOED sensory epithelium (Fig. 2)
which is continuously exposed to inhaled air (Fig. 2a). Remarkably, we found by
immunohistochemical stainings that the ACE2 protein was not only expressed at the
apical surface and in the Bowman’s glands14-16,21 but also in the basal layer (Fig. 2b).
Moreover, we found that, in addition to being irregularly localized in different regions of
the neuroepithelium15 (Supplementary Fig. 1), TMPRSS2 was mostly co-expressed
with ACE2 in these OMP-negative basal cells (Fig. 2c, d). Focusing on the identification
of these ACE2-expressing cells (Fig. 3), we first confirmed that the cytokeratin 18
(CK18)-positive sustentacular cells16,21, operating as supporting cells for the olfactory
neurons, were indeed harboring, at their luminal surface, the observed ACE2 protein
(Fig. 3a). We next established the multipotency characteristics of the ACE2-expressing
basal cells, as they also expressed two proteins specific to their identity of stem cells,
the perinuclear cytokeratin 5 (CK5; Fig. 3b) and the nuclear transcription factor sex
determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2; Fig. 3c), markers of horizontal basal cells (HBCs)
or of the pear-shaped globose basal cells (GBCs) respectively. These two populations
of basal cells are both involved in the regeneration of the neuroepithelium by acting as
short- and long-lasting reservoir cells14,40,41. Taken together, we confirmed our initial
RT-PCR results (Fig. 1b) by precisely profiling the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in
the MOED neuroepithelium. We found that the cell candidates for viral entry are ACE2expressing cells of non-neuronal and multipotent origin.

SARS-CoV-2 entry cells in the CV are mature sensory cells. Wondering about the
apparent limited level of Tmprss2 transcript in the CV (Fig. 1b), we next decided to
exploit our histological methodology (Figs. 2, 3) to precisely localize the potential
SARS-CoV-2 entry sites in sensory cells of the CV taste buds (Fig. 4). For that, we first
used Ga gustucin (GUST) as a marker of sensory cells in the tongue32, to identify taste
buds in close contact with the oral cavity (Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, using a double
immunostaining approach, we distinctly observed ACE2 expression, not only in apical
keratinocytes17,42, but also in sensory cells (Fig. 4b). Moreover, ACE2 is predominantly
expressed in the microvilli of sensory cells, gathered in the so-called taste pore, which
are directly exposed to substances entering the oral cavity29, such as viral droplets
(Fig. 4b). Furthermore, we observed a restricted localization of TMPRSS2 in the taste
pore region, strikingly co-expressed with ACE2 (Fig. 4c, d) which might also explain
the observed low-level signal for the Tmprss2 transcript (Fig. 1b). We next confirmed
the mature status of these ACE2-expressing sensory cells as they preferentially
expressed the CK18 marker43 (Fig. 5a). Moreover, and contrary to the MOED, we found
only sporadic ACE2 expression in basal CK5-positive cells (Fig. 5b) and SOX2-positive
cells (Fig. 5c, d). In summary, we identified here the co-expression of the main SARSCoV-2 entry sites in mature taste sensory cells.

SARS-CoV-2 entry cells in the GG are sensory neurons. In the mouse, there is an
ancestral sensory subsystem, the GG (Fig. 6), which has the particularity of displaying
both olfactory and gustatory traits31,32,44. Morphologically, GG neurons are covered
with a keratinized epithelium permeable to volatile water-soluble molecules coming
from the nasal cavity35 (Fig. 6a). Molecularly, it expresses both main sensory markers,
OMP and GUST32 and uses common sensory signals such as olfactory and taste

receptors32 to respond to both danger-associated odorants and tastants32,35,36.
Performing histological approaches, we first noticed that the apical keratinocyte cell
layer was, as in the CV, positive for ACE2 expression (Fig. 6b). But more surprising,
we next found ACE2 expression in the GG cells (Fig. 6b). Interestingly and contrary to
the MOED, this expression was distinctly restricted to the sensory GG neurons and not
found in the supporting S100 calcium-binding protein b (S100B)-expressing glial cells35
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Remarkably, we furthermore localized TMPRSS2 both in
apical keratinocytes and in GG neurons indicating that the two main SARS-CoV-2 entry
sites are indeed found in the GG sensory subsystem (Fig. 6c, d). Looking for a precise
characterization of ACE2-expressing cells in the GG, we next discovered that OMPpositive GG neurons were also CK18-positive (Fig. 7a) giving the GG a double cellular
affiliation (neuronal and fibroblastic) that also highlights the discovery of CK18 as a
reliable marker of ACE2 expressing cells, the putative target cells of viral infection45.
We next observed that in the apical keratinocyte layer of the GG, ACE2-expressing
cells are mostly mature as they rarely co-expressed CK5 and SOX2 (Supplementary
Fig. 2b, c), a characteristic shared with taste tissue (Fig. 5). Interestingly, and as
previously shown, no regeneration happened throughout the lifespan in the GG
subsystem31,46 as basal cells are absent which was further confirmed here by a lack of
SOX2 staining (Supplementary Fig. 2c). However, we observed in GG neurons, a
punctiform-like staining for ACE2 and CK5 (Supplementary Fig. 2b) indicating a coexpression in a precise cytoskeleton structure, as for the taste buds (Fig. 4b). We found
that these cytoskeleton regions were associated to GG primary cilia (Fig. 7b, c), an
organelle implicated in chemosensing33,36. Thanks to the particulate guanylyl cyclase
G (pGCG; Fig. 7b), a marker of the axonemes of the GG-cilia33, we observed that
ACE2 was located in the so-called basal body structures (Fig. 7c), where it was also

co-expressed with the gamma-tubulin marker35 (g-TUB; Fig. 7c). In summary, we found
that the GG sensory subsystem possesses both the viral target cells and the specific
protein profiles of expression displayed by both the olfactory and taste systems.
Moreover, we bring here evidences of the presence of viral entry sites in chemosensory
neurons.

SARS-CoV-2 entry site expression in mouse sensory systems is age-dependent.
During the course of our experiments, we noticed interindividual variations of ACE2
expression not only in its intensity but also in its general arrangement (e.g., apical
versus basal ACE2 expression in the MOED; (Fig. 2b, c). Moreover, this observation
was not only done for the MOED (Figs. 2, 3), but also for the CV (Figs. 4, 5) as well as
for the GG (Figs. 6, 7). We considered a potential age-dependent correlation47-50 and
thus we challenged the expression of ACE2 through the different sensory subsystems
using mice of chosen ages. (Fig. 8). We saw first an intense variation of ACE2
expression in the MOED (Fig. 8a). Indeed, in young mice, this expression was restricted
to the apical region, and then gradually intensifies with age (Fig. 8a). At the basal level,
it appears to be absent first and only shows up in adult mice (Fig. 8a). In the sensory
cells of the CV, ACE2 appears to be absent in young mice and only emerges with age
(Fig. 8b). Interestingly, ACE2 expression initiates in the microvilli, at around 5 months
of age, and then gradually extents throughout the cell body with aging (Fig. 8b).
Concerning the GG, we first noticed that its apical keratinocyte cell layer constitutively
expressed ACE2, while its expression was distinctly age-dependent in the sensory
neurons (Fig. 8c). Indeed, and as for the sensory cells of the CV (Fig. 8b), a subcellular
expression was first observed which spread into the soma with time (Fig. 8c). Overall,

we demonstrated here a striking age-dependent effect on ACE2 expression across
mouse sensory systems, correlating with an increase of viral entry sites.

Discussion
Our ability to perceive and interact with our environment is directly linked to our senses.
From an evolutionary point of view, our sensory performance is often associated with
the way we communicate with our surroundings. In humans, although olfaction and
taste have lost importance in comparison with mice, they remain essential not only to
our well-being but also to protect us from dangers such as intoxication

10

. Their

disorders are correlated with our general and mental health and can be early indicators
of central nervous system impairments51,52. Our sensory systems have developed a
variety of protective mechanisms to guard us against environmental attacks such as
the presence of protective keratinous epithelia, the combined action of mucus and cilia
of sustentacular cells, ensuring the drainage of environmental microorganisms via
mucociliary fluid clearance53 or even the presence of regenerative basal cells40,41.
SARS-CoV-2 seems to have found a mechanism to thwart our sensory defenses.
Indeed, we have shown here that, in mice, these very protective cells express viral
entry sites. Although the direct action by the virus on these cells remains to be
demonstrated,

the

underlying

inflammatory22,24,54

or

cytopathic

destruction

mechanisms23 would strongly impact the senses of smell and taste. It therefore seems
obvious that their targeted impairment can directly contribute to long-term anosmia and
ageusia7,55. Moreover, we have demonstrated here that the sensory cells themselves
also express the SARS-CoV-2 entry sites which could contribute to both the sensory
symptoms observed on the short term14,15,19,21 and the ability of coronaviruses to
directly infect human sensory cells20.

From a clinical point of view, anosmia and ageusia have a low prevalence in
infected children and increase with the age of the COVID-19 patient50,56, which seems
to be consistent with the protein expression of ACE2 that we have observed in the mice
olfactory system. Indeed, after we first confirmed the age-dependent trend made of
ACE2 expression in sustentacular cells47, we focused on the dorsal part of the MOE
and found that the basal cells of the neuronal epithelium also expressed ACE2 as a
function of age. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 is also expressed in these SARS-CoV-2
target cells. However, further studies, using viral inoculation for example, are still
necessary to link this specific protein expression with viral sensitivity. Moreover, we
also observed this age-effect in the taste system. As an absence of expression of the
viral entry sites is found in the sensory cells of young mice17, but an increased
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 appears in sensory cells when the mouse
advances in age. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 could therefore also directly target these sensory
cells in aged mice and, possibly, in aged humans42, altering them and consequently
disabling the taste sensory ability leading to ageusia symptoms. Thus, the use of mice
sensitized to the virus45,57-60 appears to be a promising strategy but the age of the mice
has to be carefully considered and older mice should preferentially be used (from 9
months of age). Interestingly, based on our results, additional studies performed on
the lower respiratory airways could show whether a similar increased ACE2 expression
as a function of age occurs, not only in respiratory ciliated cells49,61 but also in basal
cells which could therefore contribute to the differences in pulmonary infectiousness
observed between young and older people62.

entry sites on its sensory neurons. We also found that GG sensory neurons expressed
CK18, confirming that the cellular expression of this protein is an excellent marker for
the localization of putative viral entry cells45. Moreover, this observation is remarkable
and gives to the GG a double cellular affiliation, namely neuronal and fibroblastic by
the expression of both OMP and CK18. In this period of race for collective immunity9,
we desperately need animal models to study this disease. Our results not only confirm
the unique primary origin of the GG44 but, also make it useful as a model of sensory
systems to study, in ex-vivo and in-vivo preparations35, the mechanism of viral entry
into sensory cells as well as the testing of potential protective treatments against viral
infection, such as intranasal drugs and / or COVID-19 vaccine candidate delivery13,63,64.
Reinforcing this idea, it should be noted that another SARS-CoV-2 portal of entry,
neuropilin-165,66 is also expressed in the GG67, thus increasing its infectious
susceptibility.
In summary, we have precisely characterized the SARS-CoV-2 entry cells in the
multiple sensory systems of the mouse. These cells are of different origins. They are
either involved in tissue function and regeneration but also, specifically, in
chemosensing. We have revealed that the expression of viral entry sites in sensory
cells increases with age, in this experimental model, which might be an important factor
for viral infectivity studies. Thus, we have suggested a direct correlation between
human sensory-symptomatology and mice SARS-CoV-2-expressing entry cells
providing a putative explanation for the observed anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19
patients.

Methods
Animals. C57BL/6 mice (Mus musculus; Janvier Labs) and heterozygote OMP-GFP
mice39, of both sexes, were used at the indicated ages. In this gene-targeted mouse
strain, mature olfactory sensory neurons37 expressed the histological reporter green
fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the olfactory marker protein (OMP)
promoter38,39. Mice were grouped-housed between 21 to 23 °C under a 12 hrs
light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were euthanized by CO2
inhalation and the experimental procedures were in accordance with Swiss legislation
and approved by the EXPANIM committee of the Lemanique Animal Facility Network
and the veterinary authority of Canton de Vaud (SCAV).

Chemosensory epithelia isolation. Prior to tissue isolation processes, phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.76 mM KH2PO4, and 10 mM
Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), dissection tools and equipment were sterilized and RNase
removing agent (RNaseZAPTM; Sigma) treatments were applied. The chemosensory
epithelia were localized under the fluorescent stereomicroscope (M165 FC; Leica)
thanks to the GFP expression for the olfactory subsystems32,33. The dorsal GFPpositive prolongation of the main olfactory epithelium (MOED), corresponding to the
ethmoid turbinate 1E adherent to the nasal bone, was separated from the rest of the
MOE for the analysis. The other olfactory subsystems, the vomeronasal organ (VNO),
the septal organ of Masera (SO) and the Grueneberg ganglion (GG) were delicately
separated from the neighboring GFP negative tissues. The circumvallate papilla (CV)
was extracted from the surface of the tongue.

Gene expression profile by RT-PCR. RNA purification was completed according to
the instructions of the manufactured kit (RNeasy® Plus Mini kit; Qiagen). Briefly, the
chemosensory epithelia obtained from 5-10 adult mice (4-11 months with a
comparable sex ratio) were isolated and pooled in buffer RLT Plus supplemented with
b-mercaptoethanol. Homogenization was performed through high-speed tissue
disruption (TissueLyser II; Qiagen) and genomic DNA was removed from lysate by
using the gDNA Eliminator spin column. Centrifugation and loaded processes were
performed onto RNeasy spin columns to finally elute the total RNA in 30 μl of RNasefree water. Reverse transcription (RT) was then initiated with the cDNA synthesis kit
(PrimeScriptTM 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit; Takara) using the random hexamers
option. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments were subsequently performed
using 140 ng of cDNA and 800 nM of each specific primers for Ace2 (forward 5’–
CTACAGGCCCTTCAGCAAAG–3’; reverse 5’–TGCCCAGAGCCTAGAGTTGT–3’;
product size of 204 bp), Tmprss2 (forward 5’-ACTGACCTCCTCATGCTGCT-3’;
reverse 5’-TGACAGATGTTGAGGCTTGC-3’; product size of 225 bp) and Gapdh
(forward

5’-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3’;

reverse

5’-

ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3’; product size of 223 bp). Primers were designed
using the Primer3plus resource32. Amplification was done with 0.5 units of DNA
Polymerase (GoTaq® DNA Polymera; Promega) using a thermocycler (Veriti™;
Applied Biosystems) programmed at 95°C 30 sec, 55°C 30 sec and 68°C 45 sec for
30 cycles. Visualization of the amplification products was done with ethidium bromide
on a 3% electrophoresis gel and sizes were assessed (Bench Top 100bp DNA Ladder;
Promega). Negative controls were performed with H2O or by omitting the reverse
transcription phase.

Floating

immunohistochemistry procedures were performed to precisely localize protein
expression in the different chemosensory epithelia31,32. Accordingly, and prior to tissue
isolation, mouse heads were chemically fixated in 4% paraformaldehyde (PAF 4%, pH
7.4). After 24 h of fixation, chemosensory epithelia were rinsed in PBS and included in
low melting 4% agar. Serial coronal slices of 80-120 µm were generated with a
vibroslicer (VT1200S; Leica) and collected in ice-cold PSB. Slices were then selected
under a stereomicroscope (M165 FC; Leica) based on their general morphology and /
or GFP expression. Selected slices were then blocked for 3 h at room temperature in
a PBS solution containing 5% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch)
and 1% of non-ionic detergent (Triton® X-100; Fluka). A double and indirect
immunostaining approach using specific primary antibodies was then used to
simultaneously localize ACE2 expression with other marker proteins14,15. The primary
antibodies used were directed against ACE2 (Goat anti-ACE2; PA5-47488; Invitrogen;

antibodies and ran in parallel on C57BL/6 mice. Observations were made by LEDfluorescence microscopy (EVOS M5000; Invitrogen) and acquisitions performed with
confocal microscopy (SP5; Leica). Maximum projections, reconstructions and
colocalization analysis were made with computer assistance (IMARIS 6.3; Bitplane).

Figure 1. Differential expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry site transcripts in the mouse
chemosensory systems. a Schematic representation of a mouse head with its chemosensory systems.
Olfactory neurons are distributed in different olfactory subsystems: the main olfactory epithelium (MOE)
and its dorsal region (MOED), the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the septal organ of Masera (SO).
Chemosensory cells for gustation are found in different tongue regions, grouped in taste buds which are
presented by taste papilla such as the circumvallate papilla (CV). The Grueneberg ganglion (GG), the
most rostral olfactory subsystems, displays both olfactory and gustatory properties. b Gene expression
profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 entry sites: Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the different mouse chemosensory
systems performed by RT-PCR. Gapdh is used as a reporter gene and H2O as a negative control of
transcript expression. Gene expression profiles obtained from 5-10 heterozygote OMP-GFP mice of 4
to 11 months old. Ladder of 100 base pairs (bp).

Figure 8. Age-dependent ACE2 expression in the MOED, CV and GG. Assessment of ACE2
expression (in pink) in chemosensory systems by immunohistochemistry at the indicated age in months
(M). a A gradual increase in ACE2 expression is observed in the apical and basal cell layer of the MOED.
b In taste buds of the CV, ACE2 is sequentially expressed in the taste pore microvilli and in the sensory
somas. c In the GG region, apical keratinocytes constantly express ACE2 while this expression is
progressively observed in GG neurons (punctiform to somatic staining). Colocalization (Coloc, in yellow)
in sensory cells of ACE2 with OMP (in a and c) or GUST (in b) markers are highlighted. (a-c) Nuclei are
counterstained with Dapi (DAPI, in blue). Representative protein expression profile obtained from
heterozygote OMP-GFP mice of 0.5, 5 and 20 months old are indicated. Scale bars are 10 µm (a and
b) and 20 µm (c).
