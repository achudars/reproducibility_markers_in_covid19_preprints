SUMMARY

36

The increasing numbers of infected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by

37

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses serious threats to

38

public health and the global economy. Most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the

39

receptor binding domain (RBD) and some the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein,

40

which is the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2. While the antibody response to RBD has been

41

extensively characterized, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the NTD protein are less

42

well studied. Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-

43

CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the

44

serological response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 NTD response is less cross-

45

reactive with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice

46

model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an

47

altered antigenicity when expressed alone. Overall, our results suggest that while NTD offers

48

an alternative strategy for serology testing, it may not be suitable as an immunogen for

49

vaccine development.

Introduction

55

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is the pathogen that has caused the COVID-19

56

pandemic, has spread to over 216 countries (Liu et al., 2020c). COVID-19 patients show

57

varying disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to requiring intensive care (Liu et al.,

58

2020d). Many studies have now shown that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)

59

in COVID-19 patients is a key signature of immune response upon the infection (Barnes et

60

al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Isho et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Pinto et

61

al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The spike glycoprotein is the immunodominant target for the

62

neutralizing antibody response in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, neutralizing antibodies to

63

the spike are able to maintain detectable levels through at least 5-8 months post-infection

64

(Dan et al., 2021; Lau et al., 2021; Ripperger et al., 2020; Roltgen et al., 2020; Wajnberg et

65

al., 2020). The spike protein consists of S1 (head) and S2 (stem) subunits that are initially

66

connected by a furin cleavage site (Walls et al., 2020). The S1 contains two structurally well-

67

defined domains, namely the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD).

69

SARS-CoV-2 initiates viral entry by engaging the host receptor angiotensin converting

70

enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the RBD. Most known SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies to

71

date are RBD-specific (Barnes et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Ju et al.,

72

2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2020b; Pinto et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Seydoux et

73

al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020). Thus, detection of RBD-specific

74

antibodies is widely used in many serodiagnosis tests (Perera et al., 2020; Premkumar et al.,

75

2020). RBD has also been a major focus in vaccine design (Dai et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020;

76

Zang et al., 2020). In contrast, the immunogenicity and antigenicity of other domains on the

77

spike is not very well characterized. An increasing number of neutralizing antibodies to the

78

NTD have recently been identified from COVID-19 patients (Cerutti et al., 2021; Chi et al.,

79

2020; Liu et al., 2020b; McCallum et al., 2021; Noy-Porat et al., 2021; Suryadevara et al.,

80

2021; Wang et al., 2021a). In addition, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) is

81

suggested to be a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the NTD (Wang et al.,

82

2021b). Another recent finding shows that the NTD can interact with tetrapyrrole products

83

that reduce the reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike with human immune sera as a possible

84

mechanism to evade antibody immunity (Rosa et al., 2021). It is thus believed that

85

neutralizing antibodies to NTD antibodies may play an important role in protection against

86

SARS-CoV-2. However, the NTD-specific antibodies have been mainly identified from

87

clonal B cells of individuals. The serological response to the NTD in COVID-19 patients, as

88

well as the immunological properties of NTD are not yet well understood. In this study, we

89

evaluated the human serological response to NTD protein from 227 specimens collected from

90

141 COVID-19 patients. The cross-reactivity of NTD-specific antibody response to different

91

coronaviruses was also examined. We also explored the serological response by using NTD

92

as an immunogen for immunization in mice.

Results

95

Human serological responses to the NTD of SARS-CoV-2

96

We tested 227 plasma samples from 141 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients in Hong

97

Kong and another 195 plasma samples from healthy blood donors that were collected prior to

98

the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as baseline controls. The samples were tested in parallel in

99

ELISA assays for the IgG against NTD and RBD. For each assay, samples were defined as

100

seropositive if the detection signal was three standard deviations above the mean of baseline

101

controls. There was a progressive increase of seropositivity in the NTD ELISA after the first

102

day of symptom onset, with 25% (12 out of 48) being positive in the first two weeks and

103

84.9% (152 out of 179) after day 14 to day 141 (Table 1; Figure 1A). Consistent with our

104

previous study (Perera et al., 2020), the positivity in the RBD assay also progressively

105

increased with time after illness onset, with 58.3% (28 out of 48) specimens positive in the

106

first two weeks of illness onset and 98.3% (176 of 179) after day 14 to day 150?? (Table 1,

107

Figure 1B). Specimens that were found to be positive in the NTD ELISA (n=164) were also

108

positive in the RBD ELISA. In fact, there was a strong correlation between the serological

109

response to NTD and RBD proteins after day 8 of symptom onset (Pearson correlation =

110

0.78) (Figure 1C).

111
112

Cross reactivity of the humoral immunity from COVID-19 patients

113

The extent of cross-reactive serological responses to other coronaviruses during SARS-CoV-

114

2 infection is not fully understood. Our previous study observed that plasma samples from

115

COVID-19 patients can cross-react with the RBD of SARS-CoV (Lv et al., 2020b). Here, we

116

further tested the binding of 227 plasma samples of COVID-19 patients to the NTDs of

117

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Among the 164 samples with positive binding to the NTD of

118

SARS-CoV-2, only 8 (4.9%) cross-reacted with the NTD of SARS-CoV in the ELISA

119

binding assay (Figure 2A). There is no significant correlation in binding between the groups

120

(Pearson correlation = 0.06). In contrast, among 204 samples that showed positive binding to

121

the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, 158 (77.5%) cross-reacted to the RBD of SARS-CoV. There is a

122

significant correlation in binding between these two RBD antigens (Pearson correlation =

123

0.43) (Figure 2B). This result is consistent with the RBD having a higher sequence

124

conservation compared to NTD. While the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share

125

73% amino-acid sequence identity, their NTDs only share 53% amino-acid sequence identity

126

(Figure S1A-B).

127
128

To explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to serological responses that cross-react

129

with other human coronaviruses, we selected 118 plasma samples from the COVID-19

130

patients and tested their binding to the spike proteins of all four known human seasonal

131

coronaviruses, namely 229E, NL63, HKU-1 and OC43. The results were compared to another

132

118 plasma samples from healthy blood donors that are age- and sex-matched to the COVID-

133

19 cohort. As our control, the plasma of COVID-19 patients showed a significantly higher

134

level of binding to the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 compared to that of the healthy

135

controls (Figure 3A and B). Compared to the plasma of healthy controls, the plasma of the

136

COVID-19 cohort exhibited significantly higher binding to the spike proteins of HKU1 and

137

OC43 (Figure 3E-F). In contrast, plasma of healthy controls and COVID-19 cohort had only

138

very small differences in binding to the spike proteins of NL63 and 229E, although such a

139

difference for NL63 is still significant (P = 7e-5, two-tailed paired t-test, Figure 3C-D). We

140

also collected longitudinal plasma samples from six COVID-19 patients and tested their

141

binding to the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 as well as to the spikes of other human

142

coronaviruses by ELISA (Figure S2A-F). Although the increases in binding to the NTD and

143

RBD of SARS-CoV-2 were more dramatic, some patients showed modest elevation of

144

serological responses against the spike of different human coronaviruses, especially HKU1

145

and OC43. Of note, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HKU1 and OC43 are beta-coronavirus,

146

whereas NL63 and 229E are alpha-coronavirus. Our results suggest that memory B cells with

147

epitopes that are conserved among different beta-coronaviruses were boosted after SARS-

148

CoV-2 infection. Consistently, recent studies have shown that antibodies targeting the S2

149

domain can acquire broad reactivity among beta-coronaviruses (Huang et al., 2021; Sauer et

150

al., 2021).

151
152

Immunization of NTD alone in mice does not induce neutralizing antibody

153

Since NTD neutralizing antibodies have been shown to confer protection to SARS-CoV-2

154

(Cerutti et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; McCallum et al., 2021; Noy-Porat et

155

al., 2021; Suryadevara et al., 2021), we are interested in evaluating if the NTD protein itself

156

is immunogenic and can potentially be a vaccine candidate. We adopted our previous

157

immunization protocol where BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) immunized twice by

158

SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV NTD protein with Addavax as adjuvant (Wu et al., 2019).

159

Plasma samples were collected 14 days after the second immunization and their binding to

160

NTD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was measured by ELISA. We found that

161

immunization with SARS-CoV-2 NTD could induce homologous and cross-reactive binding

162

antibodies to the NTD proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Figure 4A). However, no

163

cross-reactive binding was observed to the SARS-CoV spike protein (Figure 4C). Similarly,

164

plasma samples from mice immunized with SARS-CoV NTD (Figure 4A and C) could cross-

165

react with SARS-CoV-2 NTD protein, but not with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Although spike

166

binding antibodies could be induced, no viral neutralizing ability could be found after either

167

SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 NTD protein immunization (Figure 4B). As a control, we also

168

tested plasma samples of the mice immunized with live SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV for

169

binding to NTD proteins (Lv et al., 2020a). In contrast to NTD immunization, mice

170

immunized with the live SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV can only elicit NTD antibodies to the

171

autologus strain (Figure 4A and C). No cross-reactivity was found to the spike proteins of

172

NL63, 229E, HKU-1 and OC43 (Figure 4D). These observations suggest that there is a

173

difference in antigenicity between NTD alone and NTD on the spike protein.

174
175

A putative structural mechanism of altered antigenicity in NTD alone

176

To further understand the mechanism of differential antibody responses between

177

immunizations with NTD alone and live virus, we performed a structural analysis of the NTD.

178

A cluster of conserved residues on NTD is buried by the RBD on the spike protein (Figure

179

5A), but is solvent exposed when NTD is presented alone (Figure 5B). In contrast, the solvent

180

exposed surface of NTD on the spike is much less conserved. Together with our observations

181

above, it is possible that, when immunization is performed using NTD, a reasonable

182

percentage of antibodies are elicited to the conserved surface of NTD that is buried when

183

presented on the spike. Besides, NTD is highly N-glycosylated . It is possible that the N-

184

glycoforms are different between when NTD is expressed alone and when presented on the

185

spike. Such differences may also contribute to the disparity in antigenicity. Therefore, our

186

structural analysis offer an explanation of 1) why NTD immunization elicits antibodies that

187

cross-react with heterologous NTD but not heterologous spike protein (Figure 4A and C), and

188

2) why immunization with NTD but not live virus, which carries the full spike protein, elicit

189

antibodies that cross-react with heterologous NTD (Figure 2B).

190
191

Discussion

192

Identification of neutralizing antibodies and their targets on SARS-CoV-2 have been a major

193

research area due to the importance for vaccine development. Over the past year, studies have

194

shown that both RBD-specific and NTD-specific antibodies can confer potent neutralizing

195

activity (Barnes et al., 2020; Cerutti et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Liu et al.,

196

2020a; Liu et al., 2020b; McCallum et al., 2021; Pinto et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020;

197

Suryadevara et al., 2021). However, while SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein can be effective in

198

eliciting neutralizing antibodies (Dai et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020), our

199

studies shows that NTD protein is a poor immunogen for eliciting neutralizing antibodies

200

since its antigenicity is altered when expressed alone, where responses may be elicited to

201

epitopes on the NTD that are inaccessible in the spike protein.

202

Nevertheless, NTD protein can be a useful tool for serology testing. After SARS-CoV-2

203

infection, both RBD and NTD binding antibodies can be induced in the patient plasma

204

samples after day 14 of symptom onset, suggesting both proteins are suitable for serology

205

testing. In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein has been using for serological diagnosis

206

(Perera et al., 2020; Premkumar et al., 2020). However, RBD-specific antibodies can be

207

cross-reactive among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and other Sarbecoviruses and may result in

208

false-positives (Cui et al., 2019; Lv et al., 2020a; Rappazzo et al., 2021). Moreover, several

209

cross-reactive epitopes against RBD also have been identified between SARS-CoV and

210

SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al., 2020a; Pinto et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). In contrast, our results

211

show that the cross-reactivity of NTD-specific antibodies to SARS-CoV is much lower that

212

RBD-specific antibodies, indicating that NTD protein could minimize false positives and be

213

an alternative for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing.

214

One interesting finding in our study is that some SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed

215

elevation of serological antibody responses against the spike proteins of another two human

216

coronaviruses, HKU1 and OC43. Immunological imprinting in SARS-CoV-2 infected

217

patients due to previous seasonal human coronavirus infection has also been reported

218

(Anderson et al., 2020; Aydillo et al., 2020). Consistently, two conserved cryptic epitopes

219

located in the S2 domain have recently discovered that enable cross-neutralization among

220

five human-infecting beta-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS and

221

OC43 (Huang et al., 2021; Sauer et al., 2021; Song et al., 2020). These observations open up

222

the possibility to develop a more universal vaccine for beta-coronaviruses.

ELISA. A 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate (Nunc MaxiSorp,

278

Thermo Fisher Scientific) was first coated overnight with 100 ng per well of purified

279

recombinant protein in PBS buffer. The plates were then blocked with 100 ฮผl of Chonblock

280

blocking/sample dilution ELISA buffer (Chondrex Inc, Redmon, US) and incubated at room

281

temperature for 1 h. Each human plasma sample was diluted to 1:100 in Chonblock

282

blocking/sample dilution ELISA buffer. Each sample was then added into the ELISA plates

283

for a two-hour incubation at 37ยฐC. After extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween

284

20, each well in the plate was further incubated with the anti-human IgG secondary antibody

285

(1:5000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 37ยฐC. The ELISA plates were then washed

286

five times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, 100 ฮผL of HRP substrate

287

(Ncm TMB One; New Cell and Molecular Biotech Co. Ltd, Suzhou, China) was added into

288

each well. After 15 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 ฮผL of 2M

289

H2SO4 solution and analyzed on a Sunrise (Tecan, Mรคnnedorf, Switzerland) absorbance

Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Plasma samples were two-fold diluted

293

starting from a 1:10 dilution and mixed with equal volumes of around 120 plaque-forming

294

units (pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV as determined by Vero E6 and Vero cells

295

respectively. After 1-hour incubation at 37ยฐC, the plasma-virus mixture was added onto cell

296

monolayers seated in a 24-well cell culture plate and incubated for 1 hour at 37ยฐC with 5%

297

CO2. The plasma-virus mixtures were then discarded and infected cells were immediately

298

covered with 1% agarose gel in DMEM medium. After incubation for 3 days at 37ยฐC with

299

5% CO2, the plates were formalin fixed and stained by 0.5% crystal violet solution.

Statistical analysis. We defined a sample as ELISA antibody positive if the OD value was 3

305

standard deviations above the mean of the negative controls. Significance between two

306

groups were determined by Mann-Whitney test with p-values lower than 0.05. Correlation

307

between plasma samples were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Two-tailed

308

paired t-tests were performed in Figure 3.
