SUMMARY
A novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) was the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness detected in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a
96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor
binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a
possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. We identified high sequence
similarity in the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a coronavirus genome reconstructed from a viral
metagenomic dataset from pangolins possibly indicating a more complex origin for nCoV-2019.

An outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019)1, first identified in
Wuhan China, has resulted in over twenty thousand confirmed cases worldwide (WHO Situation
Report, February 5 2020). Data available to date has led to the hypothesis that the outbreak
strain originated from bats. The nCoV-2019 has been reported to share 96% sequence identity to
the RaTG13 genome, a coronavirus isolated from an intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus
affinis)2. RaTG13 is the most closely related coronavirus genome to nCoV-2019, however other
viral strains may have contributed to its genomic content. To explore this hypothesis, we
examined several viral metagenomic datasets for potential coronaviruses that could harbor
RBMs closer to nCoV-2019. We report evidence of a coronavirus recovered from a Malayan
pangolin (Manis javanica) viral metagenomic dataset3 that shares a higher sequence identity at a
crucial segment of the genome involved in host infection (Figure 1). This result indicates a
potential recombination event and a more complex origin for the nCoV-2019 strain.
The coronavirus spike protein is a trimeric protein that mediates virus entry into the host cell. It
is composed of two domains: S1 and S2. The S1 domain contains two subdomains: S1-NTD and
S1-CTD, also known as the receptor binding domain (RBD). The S2 domain encodes the stalk of
the spike protein and is highly conserved across the SARS-like coronaviruses4. In order to infect a
host cell, the RBD must first bind to a surface protein on the host cell. In the case of SARS-CoV and
nCoV-2019, this is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, expressed in human
airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma among other tissues. Following RBD binding, the
S1/S2 junction must be cleaved by a surface protease4. Zhou et al. (2020)2 have reported
noticeable decreased amino acid homology between the RBD of the spike protein in RaTG13 and
nCoV-2019. A further analysis of the RBD in RaTG13 showed the majority of the divergence was
restricted to amino acid residues 435 to 510 (75% nucleotide identity and 78% amino acid
identity). This region corresponds to the receptor binding motif (RBM), which is responsible for

host specificity. Such divergence at the RBM could indicate the possibility of an alternate source
for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. To explore this, we examined several viral
metagenomic datasets for potential coronaviruses that could harbor RBMs closer to nCoV-2019.
Using VirMAP5, we aimed to reconstruct coronavirus genomes to compare recovered RBM
sequences to that of nCoV-2019.
Methods
Data used in the study
Viral metagenomic datasets of hosts that could potentially harbor coronaviruses were downloaded from
the NCBI BioProject database. These included PRJNA5732983 (pangolin), PRJNA597258 (fruit bats)
and PRJNA379515 (bats). The coronavirus genome (recovered from bat, GenBank accession number
MG772933.16) reported to be the most homologous to the nCoV-2019 outbreak strain prior to the
publication the RaTG13 (GenBank accession number MN996532) was also downloaded.
Analysis
Sequences from each project were trimmed (minimum quality score 20 and minimum length 75bp) and
filtered for Illumina adapter and PhiX presence using bbduk.sh v38.717. Prior to analysis all sequences
were filtered against a the relevant host reference genome (pangolin ManJav1.0, PRJNA256023 or bat
mRhiFer1_v1.p, PRJNA489106) using bbmap.sh v38.71(k=15 and minid=0.9)7. After trimming and
filtering, sequence reads were processed using VirMAP5 to obtain and identify coronavirus genomes
present in the viral metagenomic dataset. Two coronavirus genomes sharing high homology to nCoV2019 were recovered from the pangolin dataset in two samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378).
The two genomes were merged using the easymerge.pl subcommand from VirMAP to create the final
pangolin-associated coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) genome.
All further analysis was done using four coronaviruses genome sequences: Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13,
Bat-CoV and nCoV-2019. They were pairwise aligned on NCBI using the blastn and blastx

algorithms8,9 and sequence homology plots were calculated using RDP4 beta 9910. Distances of the
selected coronavirus genomes relative to nCov-2019 were calculated using a 300bp window sliding
every 10bp across the entire genome length. Sequence homology plots were visualized using R version
3.6.211 and the ggplot2 visualization package12. The RBM segments as well as the Pro-Arg-Arg-Ala
(PRRA) amino acid insertion region were excised from the full genome and pairwise aligned on NCBI
using blastn and blastx. Multiple alignments of the both these regions were done using MAFFT
v7.31313 and visualized with MEGAX v10.1.714.
Results
Of the three viral metagenomic datasets inspected, only the pangolin dataset contained coronavirus
genomes sharing significant homology with the outbreak strain. Two samples in this dataset yielded
two partial coronavirus genomes that overlapped >8.4kb at >99% nucleotide identity with each other.
After merging, the final Pangolin-CoV draft genome was 90.5% similar to nCoV-2019 (median
nucleotide identity). Figure 1 shows the sequence homology of Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13-CoV and BatCoV relative to nCoV-2019 (Figure 1A shows the homology across the entire genome length). The
multiple alignments across the RBM segments revealed an 89% nucleotide (Figure 1B) and 98% amino
acid identity (Figure 1C) of the Pangolin-CoV compared to nCoV-2019. The sequence homology plots
showed that the Pangolin-CoV was more similar to nCoV-2019 at the RBD region than the RaTG13CoV and Bat-CoV (Figure 1B). The multiple alignment comparing the PRRA insertion region at the
S1/S2 junction shows the insertion present in nCoV-2019 and missing in the other three CoV genomes
(Figure 2).
Discussion
Recent coronavirus zoonotic transmissions have involved non-bat intermediates. Indeed, both SARS15
and MERS16 are believed to have arisen from coronaviruses recombining in civet cats and camels,
respectively. While early indications for nCoV-2019 showed that the virus may have jumped directly

from bats to humans2, here we present evidence that nCoV-2019 likely arose from yet another
recombined coronavirus in an intermediate host. A dataset describing the viral diversity in Malayan
pangolins3 yielded a coronavirus genome that shares 89% nucleotide (Figure 1A and 1B) and 98%
amino acid (Figure 1C) identity across the same RBM segment with nCoV-2019. Additionally, the
RaTG13 genome only shares one out of five key amino acids involved in receptor binding motif2,
whereas the pangolin coronavirus shares all five key residues (Figure 1C). It therefore appears that the
RBM in nCoV-2019 was introduced during a recombination event between the strain of coronavirus
found in the pangolin and RaTG13. Given the heavy selective pressure under which the RBM is
constrained, it is unlikely that RaTG13 acquired the mutations found in the pangolin coronavirus
genome through random chance. We posit that the homology at the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a
pangolin coronavirus may have arisen from a recombination event based on sequence analysis
presented herein.
Amino acid alignment between pangolin coronavirus and nCoV-2019 at the S1-NTD subdomain
results in low sequence similarity. However, increased similarity is observed from the RBD
through the S2 domain (Figure 1A-B). This suggests a possible recombination event between a
bat coronavirus and the pangolin coronavirus at the S1-NTD and RBD junction. While there is
high conservation at the amino-acid level between the pangolin coronavirus and nCoV-2019, this
is not reflected in the nucleotide identity, suggesting that the proposed recombination event
occurred in the more distant past, allowing subsequent time for genetic drift. One such mutation
could be the insertion of the amino acid residues PRRA near the S1/S2 junction which induces a
furin cleavage motif. The secondary requirement for entry into the host cell is proteolytic
cleavage of the S1/S2 domains in order to mediate membrane fusion post ACE2 binding 4, and
introduction of the furin cleavage motif may be another factor in nCoV-2019 being able to
replicate in humans (Figure 2).

The main limitations of this analysis are the lack of additional viral datasets arising from
pangolins or the availability of coronavirus genomes isolated from pangolins that could be used
for multiple genome alignments with nCoV-2019. In addition, the current analysis only focuses
on the spike protein of nCoV-2019 without exploring additional recombination events that may
lead to changes in host tropism. Nonetheless, the identification of a possible recombination event
in the host-receptor binding protein of nCoV-2019, suggesting an intermediate host, supports a
call for continuous surveillance of species known to be infected by this group of viruses, including
pangolins, as well as all small mammals sold in such wet markets as the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market in Wuhan to better understand and characterize zoonotic transmission events.
