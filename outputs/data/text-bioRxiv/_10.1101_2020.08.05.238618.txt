ABSTRACT
An isolated epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
causing Coronavirus Diseases (C0VID-19) originating in Wuhan, China has now rapidly emerged
into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of
SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the
mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving
through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from
different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of
variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis.
We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public
domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or
probes binding sites. A total of ​13 unique ​variants had allele frequency of ≥ 1% in Indian
SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or
probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of ≥ 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for
molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights
the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for
development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most
comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India
and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now rapidly emerged as a global pandemic. Reverse
transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) based assays have been the mainstay for
the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19 due to the high sensitivity and specificity ​(Shen et al.
2020)​. These assays utilize oligonucleotide primers and probes specific to the viral nucleic acid.
The SARS-CoV-2 has been continuously evolving and has an estimated substitution rate of 1.19
to 1.31 × 10​−3 per site per year ​(Li et al. 2020)​. Recent reports that suggest genetic variation in
viruses at the primers or probes binding site could decrease its sensitivity ​(Yang et al. 2014)​.
Motivated by the availability of a large number of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India,
we attempted to understand the genomic variants and their potential impact on molecular
assays.
We analysed genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India in GISAID ​(Shu and
McCauley 2017) as on 23rd of June 2020. Sequences with <99% alignment and ≥1% gaps were
not considered for analysis. The genomes were re-aligned to the reference SARS-CoV-2
genome Wuhan-Hu-1 ​(Wu et al. 2020) ​using EMBOSS needle ​(Rice et al. 2000) and parsed for
variants using bespoke scripts. The primer/probe sequences were compiled using extensive
literature searches as well as databases (COVID-19 Primer, 2020) and were mapped to the
reference genome using BLAST ​(Rice et al. 2000)​. The SARS-CoV-2 genomic variant
coordinates were overlapped with the primer/probe binding sites. Tm and Gibbs free energy
(ΔG) was calculated​. ​We also evaluated the internal single mismatch as well as terminal
mismatch which could have an impact on the thermodynamics stability of the nucleic acid
secondary structure as well as on Tm ​Supplementary Methods 1​.
Of the 938 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India, a total of 717 were of high quality and
were further considered for the variant calling ​Supplementary Data 1.​ This analysis revealed a
total of 1,523 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as 27 indels. We could compile a total of
132 primers or probe sequences ​Supplementary Data 2​. A total of 123 SNVs and 2 indels
mapped to at least one of the 80 odd primer/probe sites in the genome ​Supplementary Data 3
of which, a total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency ≥ 1% ​Table 1 and Figure 1​. Of
significant note were three primers/probes for the ​N gene, which has variants mapping to the
target sites in over 10% of Indian isolates. Variants with >1% frequency were also found in
primer / probes encompassing ​S, E, RdRP, ORF1a​, and ​ORF3a genes ​Table 1.​ One of the variant,
15451:G:A had a high frequency of 0.6% in Indian isolates and mapping to the WHO and
ICMR-India recommended RdRP_SARSr-F2 “GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG” primer.
Additionally, two indels with 3’ end terminal mismatch were in (N=6) 0.8% in Indian
SARS-CoV-2 genomes . One of the primers is a part of WHO protocol E_Sarbeco_R2 ​(Corman
et al. 2020) ​and widely used (Eurofins Genomics, 2020). Out of these indels, one involves a 3 nt
deletion from 3’ end of the primers while the other indel deletes 41 nt that encompasses the
whole E_Sarbeco_R2 primer.
Our analysis suggests that genome sequencing of isolates in an epidemic could provide useful
insights into assessing the diagnostic efficacies as also suggested by previous authors ​(Khan
and Cheung 2020)​. We surmise that this could possibly drive policies on evaluation and
approvals of the assays for screening and diagnosis. It has not escaped our attention that a
number of genomic loci had significantly low variability in Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2
isolates suggesting an opportunity to develop better molecular assays. To the best of our
knowledge, this report is the most comprehensive report of the assessment of genomic
variants and their impact on molecular assays for Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2. The study
highlights the need to widely share genome sequences of isolates as well as molecular probe
information during epidemics.

The variant frequency, primers/probes cumulative variant frequency, Gibbs free energy (ΔG),
melting temperature (Tm), and Extinction coefficient for reference and alternate in the Indian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Only primers/probes with a cumulative variant frequency of more than
1% is included in this Table.
Tm- Melting Temperature, ΔG- Gibbs Free Energy, Ref- Reference, Alt- Alternate
* - Variants with >1% frequency were also found in primer / probes encompassing S, E, RdRP,
ORF1a, and ORF3a genes
