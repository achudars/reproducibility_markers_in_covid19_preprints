The conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded RNA regions, by adenosine
deaminases (ADARs) enzymes, is the most common form of RNA editing in metazoans (Bazak et
al., 2014). This type of RNA editing is crucial for normal development of an organism and has a
major role in the innate immune response (Mannion et al., 2014; Ganem and Lamm, 2017;
Eisenberg and Levanon, 2018). It was shown that changes in editing events are correlated with
several types of diseases; among them is cancer (Maas et al., 2006; Galeano et al., 2012; Gallo
and Locatelli, 2012; Kung et al., 2018). Editing sites may serve as biomarkers for cancer and
ADAR enzymes are considered as promising gene therapy agents to fight cancer (Ganem et al.,
2017). In addition, ADARs are known to be involved in regulation of innate immune response by
blocking the interferon response upon viral infection (Quin et al., 2021). For these reasons, A-to-I

Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, the most prevalent type of RNA editing in metazoans,
is carried out by adenosine deaminases (ADARs) in double-stranded RNA regions. Several
computational approaches have been recently developed to identify A-to-I RNA editing sites from
sequencing data, each addressing a particular issue. Here we present RESIC, an efficient pipeline
that combines several approaches for the detection and classification of RNA editing sites. The
pipeline can be used for all organisms and can use any number of RNA-sequencing datasets as
input. RESIC provides 1. The detection of editing sites in both repetitive and non-repetitive
genomic regions; 2. The identification of hyper-edited regions; 3. Optional exclusion of
polymorphism sites to increase reliability, based on DNA, and ADAR-mutant RNA sequencing
datasets, or SNP databases. We demonstrate the utility of RESIC by applying it to human,
successfully overlapping and extending the list of known putative editing sites. We further tested
changes in the patterns of A-to-I RNA editing, and RNA abundance of ADAR enzymes, following
SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines. Our results suggest that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,
compared to mock, the number of hyper editing sites is increased, and in agreement, the activity
of ADAR1, which catalyzes hyper-editing, is enhanced. These results imply the involvement of
A-to-I RNA editing in conceiving the unpredicted phenotype of COVID-19 disease. RESIC code
is open-source and is easily extendable.

In recent years, many efforts have been invested in developing computational approaches to detect
A-to-I RNA editing sites from sequencing data (Pinto and Levanon, 2019). Since inosine is very
similar in structure to guanosine, inosine is interpreted as guanosine by polymerases during
sequencing. This enables the detection of editing sites by comparing between DNA and RNA
sequences, to track adenosine to guanosine (A-to-G) mismatches. However, the detection should
be carefully performed to avoid false reports due to sequencing and alignment mistakes, alterations
in sequence originated from polymorphism, somatic mutations, or other changes which are not the
result of editing events (Pinto and Levanon, 2019). The problem is exacerbated by the fact that
editing in humans frequently occurs in repetitive regions (Athanasiadis et al., 2004; Blow et al.,
2004; Kim et al., 2004; Levanon et al., 2004; Levanon et al., 2005; Barak et al., 2009; Kleinberger
and Eisenberg, 2010; Osenberg et al., 2010; Paz-Yaacov et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011b), which tend
to cause alignment errors (Treangen and Salzberg, 2011).

Several tools developed to detect A-to-I RNA editing sites are based on comparison between RNAseq reads and DNA reference genome. Among these tools are REDItools, which suggest simple
comparison using samtools (Picardi and Pesole, 2013), and GIREMI that focused on distinguishing
between SNPs and editing, relying on existing SNP databases and a given RNA-seq data (Zhang
and Xiao, 2015). Some tools support a direct comparison between RNA-seq reads and DNA reads
from the same source, allowing editing site identification without the need for previous knowledge
(Picardi and Pesole, 2013; Lee et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Piechotta et al., 2017). A major
advantage in comparing between DNA and RNA sequences of the same biological sample is the
ability to increase accuracy by excluding changes deriving from unpublished SNPs (Pinto and
Levanon, 2019). Another way to increase the results accuracy is parallel comparison between
several RNA-seq datasets of several individuals, while taking into consideration that true editing
sites would appear in all or most samples (Ramaswami et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016; Goldstein
et al., 2017).

Hyper-editing by ADAR enzymes, which is defined as multiple A-to-I editing sites in a proximity,
is a widespread phenomenon. Since most tools designed to identify editing sites are based on the
detection of a limited number of mismatches in read alignments (to reduce alignment errors and
running time), hyper-editing events, which result in multiple mismatches in a single read, are
usually unexposed. Therefore, several recent methods were specially oriented to track hyperediting sites. Wu et al. 2011 (Wu et al., 2011a) and Porath et al. 2014 (Porath et al., 2014)
developed methods that are based on the conversion of unmapped read-sequences to a three-base
code genome and thus enable identification of hyper-editing sites. Namely, all As are transformed
to Gs in the reference genome and in the RNA-seq reads that previously failed to align, and
realignment is then carried out. Following reversion to original sequences, hyper-editing sites,
which are rich with A-to-G mismatches, can be located. In both studies, conversion to a three-base
code was repeated for all possible nucleotide pairs. It was shown that A-to-G editing was enriched
over the other editing types.

Despite the efforts to develop computational tools for A-to-I RNA editing site detection from
sequencing data, to date there is not a single platform enabling robust detection of editing sites of
different classes and their classification. Here we present RESIC, which enables detection and
classification of A-to-I RNA editing sites of different types in a single tool. We expanded the

pipeline we previously applied to identify editing sites in repetitive and non-repetitive regions
(Goldstein et al., 2017) and adopted the method by Wu et al. 2011 (Wu et al., 2011a) and Porath
et al. 2014 (Porath et al., 2014) to find hyper-editing sites. The tool includes an alignment-graph
of distinctive architecture and several filtration steps to reduce false identifications. RESIC also
enables distinguishing between polymorphism and editing events to increase readability, by using
DNA sequences, ADAR mutant RNA-sequencing datasets, or a SNP database. We demonstrate
the utility of RESIC by applying it to mapping A-to-I RNA editing sites in 16 human tissues, from
the Illumina Human Body Map project, analyzed for a similar purpose by others (Zhu et al., 2013;
Bazak et al., 2014; Porath et al., 2014). Our analysis reproduced known putative editing sites,
detected by others and included in the RADAR database (Ramaswami and Li, 2014), and extended
the list of known sites.
Since aberrant Interferon (IFN) and cytokine responses were observed in COVID-19 patients
(Moore and June, 2020) and ADAR1 was shown to activate the interferon reaction (Baños-Lara et
al., 2013), we further interrogate the activity of A-to-I RNA editing upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We show that in SARS-CoV-2 infected samples, compared to mock, ADAR1 is the only A-to-I
RNA editing enzyme that is differentially expressed, and the numbers of A-to-I hyper editing sites
are larger.

Ambiguous read filtering
For ambiguous read filtering, we adopted the method of (Porath et al., 2014). Briefly, we filtered
out the reads that meet the next criteria: one or more nucleotides represent over 60% or under 10%
of the read sequence, more than 10% Ns (when a base call could not be done), average Phred
quality score < 25, and more than 20 repeats of a single nucleotide in a row.

Alignment scheme

RESIC enables the user to supply DNA or RNA datasets that should exhibit the desired editing
phenomena and DNA or RNA sequencing datasets that should not exhibit the desired editing
phenomena. The latter group is used to exclude changes deriving from SNPs. Since nucleotide
changes in the former sequencing datasets correspond to positive evidence of that sites undergoing
editing and the latter datasets correspond to negative evidence, we term these sets of datasets as
positive and negative datasets. RESIC is completely reference agnostic; the user provides
whichever reference file they wish to use for the alignment as well.

We define an alignment scheme to be a 4-tuple 𝑆 = (𝐴, 𝑝, 𝑓1 , 𝑓2 ) where 𝐴 is an alignment
algorithm, 𝑝 is a list of alignment parameters for 𝐴, 𝑓1 is a preprocessing function of the raw
datasets and 𝑓2 is a postprocessing function for aligned and misaligned reads. These seemingly
verbose definitions enable RESIC to decouple the choice of alignment algorithm from the rest of
the modules in RESIC.
Let 𝑆 be an alignment scheme, 𝐿 be a sequencing dataset and 𝑅 be a genome reference, we define
𝑃𝑆,𝐿,𝑅 and 𝑁𝑆,𝐿,𝑅 to be the aligned and misaligned read fractions resulting from running S on L and
R. We define S(𝐿, 𝑅) = (𝑃𝑆,𝐿,𝑅 , 𝑁𝑆,𝐿,𝑅 )
.

Graph Aligner
Given a directed acyclic graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸) where nodes in 𝑉 are alignment schemes, 𝐿 a
sequencing dataset and 𝑅 a reference we define new alignment schemes 𝐺𝑣 (𝐿, 𝑅) for each 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉
to be defined as follows:
𝑣(𝐿, 𝑅) (𝑣) = ∅
𝐺𝑣 (𝐿, 𝑅) = {
𝑣(𝐿′′, 𝑅) 𝐿′′ =∩𝑢∨(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸 𝑁𝐺𝑢,𝐿,𝑅

134
135
136
137

We define 𝐺(𝐿, 𝑅) to be a set of aligned sequencing datasets {𝑃𝐺𝑣 ,𝐿,𝑅 |𝑣 ∈ 𝑉} . Simply put, we
perform the alignment scheme of node v on all read fragments that were misaligned in any of v’s
ancestors.

3nt genome alignment scheme:
Let 𝑋 and 𝑌 be two distinct nucleotides. To be able mapping hyper editing sites, we apply the 3nt
alignment scheme by which each appearance of either 𝑋 or 𝑌 is transformed into 𝑋 in both the
sequencing datasets (reads) and the reference genomes. That was similarly done by others (Wu et
al., 2011a; Porath et al., 2014). However, we present an advanced 3nt technique to map hyper
antisense reads as was not described elsewhere, to the best of our knowledge. First, for each 𝑋 and
𝑌 nucleotides pairs, we first apply the scheme to the reads at the given node (see graph aligner)
and to the reference sense strand. Next, in order to identify hyper editing sites on the antisense
strand, for each 𝑋 and 𝑌 nucleotides pairs, we create the complement reference genome, based on
the original reference, and reverse the reads that were unmapped in the previous step, to achieve
the 3' - 5' direction, same as the created reference. Then we reapply the 3nt alignment scheme while
considering the manipulation when recording the mapped reads as aligned to the antisense.
In each step, after mapping the reads, aligned and unaligned reads are reverted to their original
sequence via custom python scripts. Figure S1 illustrates into details the 3nt genome alignment
scheme. To conduct the 3nt scheme we use awk (Aho et al., 1996) and sed (Free Software
Foundation).

Site filtering
After performing the graph alignment for each of the given sequencing datasets, samtools (Li et
al., 2009) is used to convert the files into pileup format. Then, several filtering steps are performed
as detailed below. All parameters (l, k1, k2, u, r, and c) are user defined.

First, sites with no nucleotide changes and sites covered by less than 𝑙 reads are discarded. We
discarded sites from the positive datasets if those same sites appeared in any negative dataset with
a nucleotide change.

Editing percent filtering
For each positive sequencing dataset, we filter out any site: (1) whose most abundant nucleotide
change constitutes less than 𝑘1 percent or more than 𝑘2 percent of the reads mapped to that site (2)
whose other nucleotide changes constitute over 𝑢 percent of the reads mapped to that site (3) whose
most abundant nucleotide change is in at least r reads. We term: 𝑘1 , the minimal editing percent
threshold, 𝑘2 , the maximal editing percent threshold, r, the editing read threshold, and u, the editing
noise threshold.

170
171

Unique site filtering
We filter all sites that were defined as editing sites at the previous step, under more than one editing
category (e.g. non-repetitive and Hyper A to C), if they represented more than one type of
nucleotide change (e.g. once A to G and the other time A to C).

Hyper editing filtering
Deriving from our method, it may be possible that under the hyper editing categories, a non-hyper
editing site would be recorded. Namely, for each pair of nucleotides X and Y that we perform the
3nt genome scheme, other nucleotide mismatches than hyper X to Y or Y to X may be noted,
enabled by the new conditions created by the 3nt scheme. Therefore, we filter the hyper editing
files to include only X to Y or Y to X changes (see an illustration in Figure S1).

Consensus
We filter out any sites that are not present in over c percent of positive datasets.

In our screen for A-to-I editing sites, we define two classes of alignment schemes, non-repetitive
alignment for reads that map uniquely to the genome and repetitive for repetitive regions or regions
that cannot be differentiated by our reads via alignment. Our graph alignment, summarized in
Figure S2, is as follows: We align sequencing datasets using the non-repetitive normal scheme
followed by the repetitive normal scheme. Then we branch out and for each pair of distinct
nucleotides X and Y, we perform the non-repetitive 3nt genome scheme, and the repetitive 3nt
genome scheme.

We implemented a hyper editing alignment scheme and built an alignment graph that could target

Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) alignment tool. For the non-repetitive and repetitive alignments,
we configured bowtie to align to fragments if they map to under 2, or 20 different genomic
locations, respectively, with at most 3 single base mismatches and to consider matches for a read
r as the set of alignment results for r with the smallest alignment score (-m 2 -n 3 --best --strata, l 50 --chunkmbs 200, and -m 20 -n 3 --best --strata - l 50 --chunkmbs 200 ,respectively). Similar
alignment was used in Goldstein et al. (Goldstein et al., 2017). For the site filtration steps, we
choose 𝑙 = 2 to be the coverage per site threshold, 𝑘1 = 30 and 𝑘2 = 99 for the editing minimal
and maximal percent threshold, respectively, u = 3 for the noise thresholds, r =2 for the editing
read threshold, and 𝑐 = 0 for consensus threshold. The site lists obtained for each tissue were
filtered to have only A-to-I sites, namely A-to-G, or T-to-C mismatches in both strands.

Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells
Raw RNA-seq data of Calu-3 human Lungadenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus
or mock, were downloaded from SRA, BioProject PRJNA615032. FastQC was used to control the
read quality and trimming was performed accordingly. Reads were collapsed and first aligned to
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome version NC_045512.2 using bowtie. Alignment to the SARSCoV-2 genome was made to exclude reads that are originated from the virus for further analysis,
and to validate that in contrast to the mock samples, the SARS-CoV-2 samples are infected with
the virus. Indeed, few thousands of reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, only for the
SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. We applied RESIC separately on the unaligned reads of the mock
and SARS-CoV-2 infected samples (3 biological replicates each) to identify changes in RNA
editing events upon coronavirus infection. For the underline sequencing algorithm, we used
Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) alignment tool. For the non-repetitive and repetitive alignments,
we configured bowtie to align to fragments if they map to under 2, or 100 different genomic
locations, respectively, with at most 3 single base mismatches (-m 2 -n 3 --best --strata, - l 50 -chunkmbs 200, and -m 100 -n 3 --best --strata - l 50 --chunkmbs 200, respectively). For the site
filtration steps, we choose 𝑙 = 2 to be the coverage per site threshold, 𝑘1 = 30 and 𝑘2 = 99 for
the editing minimal and maximal percent threshold, respectively, u = 3 for the noise thresholds,
and r =2 for the editing read threshold. The consensus module was run with 𝑐 = 0.5. We then
filtered the site lists obtained to have only A-to-I sites. Since the RNA library preparation strategy
was stranded (the sequenced strand must be from the actual expressed strand), we filtered the files
obtained to include only A-to-G, and not T-to-C sites.

To perform differential expression analysis, we mapped the same unaligned reads that were used
for RESIC analysis before, to the human transcriptome version GRCh37 (hg19) using bowtie. Gene
expression levels were evaluated by read counts. We then compared our created gene counts to the
already processed counts downloaded from GEO: GSE147507. Although read count values were
not identical, as expected due to the use of different alignment tools, the trend was the same.

RESIC – A comprehensive tool for identification RNA editing sites

246

To have a complete identification of RNA editing sites, which include sites in non-repetitive
regions, sites in repetitive regions, and sites in hyper-editing regions, we generated a novel tool
termed "RNA Editing Sites Identification and Classification" (RESIC). RESIC composed of an
enhanced alignment graph model to identify and classify editing sites by their type, multiple-step
filtering process to increase result reliability in a flexible manner (Figure 1 A-B) and plots for
data visualization (see an example in Figure 2).

To use RESIC, the user should supply positive datasets, i.e. RNA-/DNA sequencing datasets that
should exhibit the desired editing phenomena, and a reference genome. The user may also supply
negative datasets, DNA or RNA sequencing datasets that should not exhibit the desired editing
phenomena, or a SNP database, to contradict editing-site existence.
All datasets are first processed according to the graph alignment (Figure 1 A-B). The graph
alignment was designed to track editing sites of different types by aligning a given set of reads to
the reference genome in a specific parameter configuration setup that represents each editing
class. Namely, we demanded unique or multiple alignment to detect nonrepetitive and repetitive
sites respectively, Next for sequences that did not align, we converted read-sequences to a threebase code to detect hyper editing sites for all possible nucleotide pairs, as described by Wu et al.
2011 (Wu et al., 2011a) and Porath et al. 2014 (Porath et al., 2014). Our alignment-graph
distinctive architecture enables the fluent utilization of an unmapped read-set that was discarded
in one alignment level for defining editing sites of a different class in the next level (Figure 1B).
This enables the identification of multiple editing-site classes in a single platform. While RESIC
was built to provide a way to consolidate the many ongoing efforts at A-to-I editing site
identification, our graph aligner model is general and robust enough to stand on its own and
contribute to general identification of nucleotide changes.

Following alignment, the candidate editing sites that were identified are going throw strict multistage filtering process (Figure 1A). The filtering process aim is to increase the result reliability
considering different types of possible errors. In one type, sites in which there is more than one
mismatch type or sites showing low change ratio are suspicious as technical errors likely to be
formed during sequencing or alignment and discarded due to low reliability. The user may easily
modify the limiting thresholds controlling these filtering steps (i.e. minimal coverage per site,
minimal change ratio and maximal noise ratio). In another type, incorrect recognition of SNPs as
editing sites can be prevented by excluding sites that show the same nucleotide alterations in
both the DNA and the RNA sequences. The user may choose (but it is not mandatory) supplying
DNA sequencing data of the same individual used to detect editing sites, for enabling the
described DNA based exclusion. Another way in which SNPs can be distinguished from editing
sites is parallel comparison between several samples of different individuals to test for the
consensus level of editing sites. The rationale behind parallel comparison of various individuals
is that true editing sites would appear in all or most samples (Ramaswami et al., 2013; Wang et
al., 2016; Goldstein et al., 2017). In addition, biological replicas can eliminate changes that
occurred because of sequencing errors. Testing for consensus in editing sites among several

Figure 1: RESIC's schematic view. (A) Overall description of the RESIC pipeline. First all given
sequencing datasets are filtered for ambiguous reads and go through the graph alignment scheme
to detect A-to-I editing sites of different classes. The RNA-seq datasets intended for editing-sites
identification are termed positive datasets, and the RNA and/or DNA sequencing datasets used to
contradict editing-site existence are termed negative datasets. Sam-files for each alignment node
are created using a sequence aligner (Langmead et al., 2009) and converted into pileup files using
samtools (Li et al., 2009). The next stage includes several filtering steps for removing: 1) sites with
no changes compared to the reference or low coverage sites 2) SNPs or mismatches that are not
originated in RNA editing, based on comparison to the negative datasets or/and a SNP database
(optional). 3) sites with more than one prominent mismatch (large noise) or with low change ratio.
4) sites that do not appear in over c% samples (optional). Finally, a list of editing sites divided into
classes are given as an output with descriptive plots. (B) Zoom in on the data flow illustration of
the graph aligner model for the four-layer graph used in the study.

RESIC enhanced the number of identified A-to-I editing sites in human tissues
In order to test the utility of the tool, we used RNA-seq datasets from 7 human tissues: adipose,
adrenal, brain, breast, colon, kidney, and heart (Illumina Human Body Map 2.0 Project; GEO
accession number GSE30611) that were sequenced at 75 single read (SR). These datasets were

We used the latest GRCh37 SNP database (NCBI) to eliminate changes that are not originated
from A-to-I RNA editing, but from genomic polymorphism. All datasets were processed according
to the graph alignment and went through all filtration steps (for parameters setup, see Methods).
Since each of the 16 samples is originated from a different tissue, and editing sites may be tissue
specific (Picardi et al., 2015), we defined 𝑐 = 0 for consensus threshold. To test the power of
RESIC to specifically identify A-to-I editing sites, we compared the output of RESIC
(Supplementary Table S1) to the collection of A-to-I RNA editing sites, taken from RADAR
(Ramaswami and Li, 2014). It is indicated by our comparison (Table 1) that over 75% of the nonrepetitive sites RESIC identified, and over 65% of non-repetitive hyper sites are also included in
the RADAR collection. This large overlap is expected, since RADAR is based, among others, on
the same samples analyzed by us, and at the same time strengthening the reliability of RESIC.
Since hyper editing sites are less frequently found by traditional tools, dictated by the parameter
setup (Pinto and Levanon, 2019) and tools that aimed for tracking hyper-editing sites (Wu et al.,
2011a; Porath et al., 2014) are less abundant, it is not surprising that a smaller overlap was obtained
for non-repetitive hyper sites, compared to non-repetitive.

Among all classes defined via RESIC, “non-repetitive” is the class yielded the largest overlap
(75.4%, 65.4%, 27.0%, and 30.7%, for Nonrepetitive, Nonrepetitive hyper, Repetitive, and
Repetitive hyper, respectively; Table 1). For repetitive site classes, smaller overlap was obtained.

325

327

As marked from our results, a substantial portion of sites detected by RESIC were not identified
by others. The explanation for the new identified sites in this study may be the result of the usage
of different tools for alignment, (i.e. Bowtie in our case and BWA, or a combination of Bowtie,
SOAP, and BWA in (Zhu et al., 2013; Porath et al., 2014), as well as various threshold parameters
and filtering criteria being set to consider sites as “editing sites” across tools.

The distribution of the editing events divided into classes can be shown in Figure 2, presenting
for example the RESIC results for an adrenal tissue sample (the plots obtained from the rest of
the samples can be found in the Supplementary Material (Figure S3 - Figure S8). A-to-G and Tto-C are both considered as editing changes because the data is not stranded. Over all classes
being identified according to the graph alignment, A-to-G and T-to-C types were highly
enriched, as expected (Figure 2). While non A-to-G mismatches are expected to be uncommon

(Li et al., 2011; Kleinman and Majewski, 2012), RESIC still identified a certain amount of sites
of that type, although in a much lower extent. This may be the result of rare SNPs that are
uncovered by the SNP database being used.

Overall, the unique characterization of RESIC enables the detection of different classes of editing
events, in one tool. The specificity of RESIC can be seamlessly controlled by modifying the
running parameters, and by suppling datasets to exclude SNPs.

To identify and classify RNA editing sites, we applied RESIC on Calu3 cell lines that were infected
with SARS-CoV-2 virus or mock (see Methods). Following RESIC run, we assessed the numbers
of the most prevalent classes of A-to-I RNA editing types: non-repetitive, and hyper non-repetitive.
We compared between SARS-CoV-2 and mock editing site numbers for each class following
normalization, relying on the total read processed in each node. A-to-I non-repetitive hyper editing
was much frequent in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to mock (The number of hyper editing
sites upon SARS-CoV-2 infection was 36.45% greater than in mock; Figure 3). In addition,
although in the non-repetitive class the site numbers were relatively low for both sample types, the
number of non-repetitive editing sites was larger as well in SARS-CoV-2 (The number of nonrepetitive sites upon SARS-CoV-2 infection was 28.62% greater than in mock; Figure 3).

Systemic inflammatory responses to viral infection are triggered by IFN-mediated innate immune
response (Schneider et al., 2014). Properly orchestrated, this type of immune response leads to
inhibition of virus replication, promotion of virus clearance and induction of tissue repair.
However, in some people infected with COVID-19, unpredictably, the innate immune response is
exaggerated leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (Moore and June, 2020).
The innate immune response is regulated by ADAR enzymes, which modulate the interferon
response to viral infection and reduce the innate immune response. ADAR1 was also shown to
prevent MDA5 from sensing dsRNA (Liddicoat et al., 2015) and activating both type I and type
III IFNs (Baños-Lara et al., 2013). Therefore, we wished to interrogate the activity of ADAR
enzymes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, we analyzed the data of Blanco-Melo
et al, of human Calu3 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus or mock (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020),
to examine the differences in A-to-I RNA editing patterns.

To understand whether the higher editing activity upon SRAS-CoV-2 infection is manifested by a
larger number of sites in the same genes as in mock, or additional sites located in new genes, we
characterized the editing landscape with respect to site locations and gene annotation.
We first tested the ratio of shared sites between SARS-CoV-2 and mock samples. For both nonrepetitive and hyper non-repetitive classes, almost ~70% of the sites were unique among samples
infected with SARS-CoV-2, and about 60% of the sites were unique for mock samples
(Supplementary Table S2). We next annotated the unique sites for each sample type, across
different classes. It was apparent that the answer for our initial question is that among the unique
editing sites following SARS-CoV-2 infection, some of the sites were extended the editing in
baseline genes (considering the mock as the baseline), but most of the sites were in new genes
(Supplementary Table S2).
Interestingly, the gene APOBEC3C became hyper edited following SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Supplementary Table S3), while in mock samples it was classified under the non-repetitive class.
The APOBEC family of enzymes edits C-to-U RNA modifications and known to be involved in
regulation of innate immune response (Rosenberg et al., 2011; Schaefer et al., 2017). C-to-U
editing of antibody-coding genes in the host’s DNA leads to diversification of the repertoire of
antibodies produced against viruses, called somatic hypermutation (SHM) (Cogné, 2013).
Therefore, hyper editing in APOBC genes may indicate for their involvement in COVID-19
phenotype, as part of a complex immune regulation system, controlling by A-to-I RNA editing.
To test if the sets of unique edited genes display shared biological processes, we examined their
biological process enrichment, using the web-based tool GeneMANIA (Zuberi et al., 2013).
Submitting the list of hyper-nonrepetitive unique edited genes, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,

resulted in the enrichment of processes related to the regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB
signaling (P-adjusted values of related pathways in the range of 1.91E-03 - 3.50E-04;
Supplementary Table S3). This result is intriguing in the light of strong indications suggesting
that NF-kappaB pathway signaling has a critical role in controlling an excessive immune activation
and ARDS (Kircheis et al., 2020). These indications, together with our result of hyper-editing in
genes participating in the NF-kappaB pathway, suggest that A-to-I RNA editing activity may be
critical to define the progression of COVID-19 disease and the risk to develop ARDS. We next,
tested an enrichment for genes that were classified under the non-repetitive class and were uniquely
edited in SARS-CoV-2 samples. Strong enrichment was obtained for processes related to
interferon response (P-adjusted values of related pathways in the range of 1.25E-06 -1.03E-12;
Supplementary Table S4), corroborating previous evidence that ADARs control interferon
activation under viral infections (Baños-Lara et al., 2013), and suggests particularly that in
COVID-19, ADARs control the level of immune response. We further run GeneMANIA for
biological process enrichment with the mock unique gene sets, as a control. No processes related
to interferon or NF-kappaB signaling were enriched in FDR<0.05 (Tables S5- S6).

Given these observations, we reasoned that interrogating the differences in ADAR RNA expression
levels between SARS-CoV-2 and mock treated samples, would help to complete the picture.
Therefore, we performed Differential Expression Analysis (DEA), on the same data of BlancoMelo et al (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) used for RESIC. We first created the read counts for both
SARA-CoV-2 and mock Calu3 samples (see Methods). We than compared our created gene counts
to those reported by Blanco-Melo et al (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) GEO accession number
GSE147507. Although read count values were not identical, as expected due to the use of different
alignment tools, the trend was the same.

We performed DEA to identify changes in the expression of ADAR genes and A-to-I RNA editing,
following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Table S7). We found that all 10 ADAR1
isoforms are significantly upregulated Figure 4, P-value = 2.2e-16) in SARS-CoV-2 Calu3
infected cells. In comparison, the expression of ADAR2 did not differ between SARS-CoV-2 and
mock samples (Figure 4, P-value >> 0.05). We also found that IFIH1 (NM_022168.4), that
encodes for Melanoma Differentiation-Associated Protein 5 (MDA5) is significantly up-regulated
in the SARS-CoV-2 infected samples (Supplementary Table S7, P-adjusted = 7.46e-137). This is
in line with findings indicating that the IFN response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection is primarily
regulated by MDA5 (Yin et al., 2021). Since ADAR1 is known to prevent MDA5 from sensing
dsRNA (Liddicoat et al., 2015), this result strengthening the conclusion that ADAR1 is largely
involves in the immune response following SARS-CoV-2.

426
427
428

Collectively, we suggest that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to mock 1) the number of
hyper editing sites is increased; 2) ADAR1 activity is enhanced. The combination between these
two observations goes together with the finding that ADAR1 is the enzyme mostly catalyzing
hyper editing sites (Porath et al., 2014).

We tested if these results hold true for more in-vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types created in
the same study. For that purpose, we downloaded from GEO the already processed gene count
data, for A549 and NHBE cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 high-multiplicity of infection (MOI).
We chose downloading the already processed gene count data after validating for Calu3 cells that
the gene count values created by us and the downloaded gene count from GEO (accession number
GSE147507) are of the same trend (see Methods). For A549 cells, with a vector expressing human
ACE2, indeed ADAR1, but not ADAR2, was significantly upregulated following SARS-CoV-2
infection, corroborating our previous results for Calu3 cells. However, for NHBE cells, both
ADAR1 and ADAR2 were not significantly changed after SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Supplementary Table S8). The non-significant upregulation of ADAR1 in the last case may be
because of the different cell types used. In any event, we concluded that unlike ADAR2 the
expression of ADAR1 is substantially different upon SARS-CoV-2, at least in some cell types.

441
442

Taken together, our results suggest that the catalyzation of hyper editing sites by ADAR1 is
enhanced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results are intriguing in the context of ADAR1

role to block the interferon response, and particularly the role of hyper editing events to suppress
the interferon induction (Vitali and Scadden, 2010). We hypothesize that editing levels might be
indicative of the progression of COVID-19 disease and the risk to develop ARDS, as holds true in
autoimmune diseases, due to the editing effect on the interferon response. Therefore, these results
shed new light on the involvement of A-to-I RNA editing mechanism in COVID-19 disease. We
note that supporting experimental validation is required to assess our conclusions. Our analysis
encourages further exhaustive study of A-to-I RNA editing role in COVID-19 disease.

Figure S1: Detailed illustration of 3nt genome alignment scheme. (A) A reference genome. (B)
The DNA sequence of the reference genome split by strand. Red, sense strand, presented in 5’-to3’ direction; Blue, antisense strand, presented in 3’-to-5’ direction. The nucleotide sequences
complement each other. (C) G-A 3nt replacement for the reference genome: Gs are converted into
As (D) cDNA reads from RNA-sequencing, all obtained in 5’-to-3’ direction. Green nucleotides
indicate for A-to-G editing sites (G instead of A in the reference genome). Brown nucleotides
present G-to-A changes compared to the reference genome. Purple nucleotides present other
mismatches than A-to-G or G-to-A. Red, sense strand; Blue, antisense strand. (E) Alignment
following 3nt graph scheme - Part 1. read 3nt sense: Gs are converted into As in the cDNA reads.
Hyper edited sense reads are successfully being mapped to the reference genome. (F) Alignment
following 3nt graph scheme- Part 2, 3nt antisense: unmapped reads from part 1 are being reverted
(not shown) and reversed to fit the 3’-to-5’ direction of the antisense reference strand. Gs are
converted into As in the cDNA reads. Hyper edited antisense reads are successfully being mapped
to the reference genome. (G) Reverting unmapped reads back from As to Gs and defining editing
sites. Sites other than A-to-G or G-to-A are excluded.
