Abstract

25
26

Both gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been

27

frequently observed in COVID-19 patients. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 replicate in

28

the human intestine and its clinical relevance to potential fecal-oral transmission remain

29

unclear. Here, we demonstrate productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2+ mature

30

enterocytes in human small intestinal enteroids. In addition to TMPRSS2, another

31

mucosa-specific serine protease, TMPRSS4, also enhanced SARS-CoV-2 spike

32

fusogenic activity and mediated viral entry into host cells. However, newly synthesized

33

viruses released into the intestinal lumen were rapidly inactivated by human colonic fluids

34

and no infectious virus was recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients.

35

Our results highlight the intestine as a potential site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, which

36

may contribute to local and systemic illness and overall disease progression.

Introduction

39
40

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a new world pandemic, claiming

41

the deaths of over 160,000 people. This outbreak is caused by a novel severe acute

42

respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (1, 2), which belongs to the family of

43

Coronaviridae, a group of enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA viruses.

44

Currently, there are no clinically approved countermeasures available for COVID-19. The

45

SARS-CoV-2 associated disease seems to take an extra toll on the elderly, although the

46

host immunological responses to the pathogen remain largely unknown. SARS-CoV-2

47

also has a more pronounced disease time course compared to some other recent

48

respiratory viruses, raising questions about other potential modes of transmission.

49
50

The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the target cell is initiated by interactions between the

51

spike glycoprotein (S) and its cognate receptor, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

52

(2-5). Following receptor engagement, SARS-CoV-2 S is processed by a type II

53

transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 to gain access to the host cell cytosol (3, 6).

54

Interestingly, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI)

55

tract, in particular by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the predominant target cells for

56

many human enteric viruses. In fact, multiple animal CoVs are natural enteric pathogens,

57

causing GI diseases and spreading by the fecal-oral route (7). Notably, GI symptoms

58

including abdominal pain and diarrhea were observed in 20-50% of COVID-19 patients

59

and sometimes preceded the development of respiratory diseases (8-10). Substantial

60

amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been consistently detected in stool specimens from

61

COVID-19 patients (11-15). In a recent study, no infectious virus was successfully

62

isolated from the feces of COVID-19 patients (16). However, the fecal shedding data

63

raises the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may act like an enteric virus and could potentially

64

be transmitted via the fecal-oral route.

65
66

In the present study, we aimed to address: 1) do SARS-CoV-2 actively infect human IECs?

67

2) if so, what host factors mediate efficient replication? 3) are there replication competent

68

viruses shed in the fecal samples of COVID-19 patients? Here, we report, for the first time,

69

that SARS-CoV-2 apically infects human mature enterocytes and triggers epithelial cell

fusion. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 serine proteases mediate this process by inducing S

71

cleavage and enhancing fusogenic activity of the virus. We also found that human colonic

72

fluids rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and likely in the intestinal lumen, rendering

73

viral RNA non-infectious in the stool specimens. Our findings have both mechanistic and

74

translational relevance and add to our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

SARS-CoV-2 infects human intestinal enteroids

79
80

In the intestine, ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the neutral amino acid transporter

81

B0AT1 (encoded by SLC6A19) on IECs and regulates microbial homeostasis (17, 18). In

82

fact, ACE2 expression is substantially higher in the small intestine than all the other

83

organs including the lung in both humans and mice (Fig. S1A-B). Therefore, we sought

84

to identify whether SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting IECs and understand the

85

implications of IEC replication for fecal-oral transmission. We performed single-cell RNA-

86

sequencing (RNA-seq) to capture the global transcriptomics in all IEC subsets in the

87

mouse small intestinal epithelia (Fig. 1A, left panel). We found that ACE2 was

88

predominantly expressed in Cd26+Epcam+Cd44-Cd45- mature enterocytes (19, 20) (Fig.

89

1A, right panel). In addition, bulk RNA-seq results revealed that primary human ileum

90

enteroids had significantly higher mRNA levels of all known CoV receptors including

91

ACE2 than the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 and other non-IEC human cell lines (Fig.

92

S1C). Quantitative PCR confirmed abundant ACE2 transcript levels in both human

93

duodenum and ileum derived enteroids (Fig. S1D). ACE2 protein was specifically co-

94

localized with actin at the apical plasma membrane of human enteroid monolayers (Fig.

95

1B). Higher ACE levels correlated with more mature enterocytes present in differentiated

96

enteroids (Fig. 1B), consistent with our scRNA-seq findings (Fig. 1A). We further

97

confirmed in the 3D Matrigel embedded enteroids that ACE2 had an almost perfect co-

98

localization with Villin (Fig. S1E), an IEC marker localized most strongly to the brush

99

border of the intestinal epithelium.

100
101

We next took advantage of the recently established vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-

102

chimera GFP reporter virus with its glycoprotein (G) genetically replaced with SARS-CoV-

103

2 S protein (In Press). This VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP virus serves as a powerful tool to

104

study viral entry and cell tropism. The levels of viral RNA increased by ~10,000 fold in

105

human duodenum enteroids over 24 hours post infection (Fig. 1C), indicative of active

106

replication. Differentiated enteroids with higher ACE2 levels (Fig. 1B) supported 39-fold

107

higher SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus replication than stem cell based cultures (Fig. 1C). We

108

could visualize GFP positive infected cells in duodenum enteroids in both traditional 3D

109

(Fig. 1D) and in flipped “inside-out” models where the apical side of the IECs was on the

110

outside of the spherical organoid (21) (Fig. S1F). In addition to viral RNA and protein, the

111

amount of infectious viruses increased >1,000 fold within the intestinal epithelium at 24

112

hours post infection (Fig. 1E). Robust viral replication was confirmed in human ileum and

113

colon-derived enteroids (Fig. 1F-G).

116
117

To further characterize the potential SARS-CoV-2 route of infection, we employed the 2D

118

monolayer system (22), with a clear separation of apical and basal compartments. We

119

noted that the human IECs were preferentially (> 1,000 fold) infected by the virus from

120

the apical surface compared to the basolateral side (Fig. 2A). This data is in line with a

121

strong apical ACE2 expression (Fig. 1B and S1E). Importantly, we found that the newly

122

produced virus progenies were also predominantly released from the apical side into the

123

lumen (Fig. 2B), suggesting a possibility of fecal viral shedding in COVID-19 patients.

124
125

To definitive pinpoint the IEC subset(s) targeted by SARS-CoV-2, we infected duodenum

126

enteroids with the SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus and co-stained with different IEC markers.

127

GFP signals were exclusively found in CD26 positive mature villous absorptive

128

enterocytes and not in goblet (MUC2), enteroendocrine (CHGA), or Paneth (LYZ) cells

129

(data not shown). Using the live infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, we validated that viral RNA

130

increased by 320-fold within the first 8 hours of infection (Fig. 2C). In addition, SARS-

131

CoV-2 infection of enteroid monolayers suggested that ACE2 positive mature enterocytes

132

were indeed the predominant target cells in the gut epithelium (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, a

133

3D reconstruction of confocal images showed that the S protein was highly concentrated

134

towards the apical surface (Fig. 2E), suggesting a potential mechanism of polarized viral

135

assembly and subsequent apical release.

136
137

While SARS-CoV induced minimal syncytia formation in the absence of exogenous

138

proteases such as trypsin (23, 24), SARS-CoV-2 was able to fuse cells during natural

139

infection of cultured cells (Fig. S2A). We also observed multiple events of syncytia

140

formation between IECs in both 2D monolayer (Fig. S2B) and in 3D Matrigel (Fig. S2C

141

and Video S1). The cell fusion and subsequent cytopathic effect may have important

142

implications regarding the common GI symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients (25-29).

143
144

TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 but not ST14 mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry

145
146

Several pieces of cell line-based evidence demonstrated that the membrane-bound

147

TMPRSS2 plays a critical role in processing S cleavage and mediating SARS-CoV-2

148

entry (3, 6, 30). Interestingly, only two other serine proteases in the same family,

149

TMPRSS4 and matriptase (encoded by ST14) shared a highly specific expression pattern

150

in human IECs (Fig. 3A). Previous studies indicated that both TMPRSS4 and ST14

151

facilitate influenza A virus but neither play a role in SARS-CoV infection (31-34). Notably,

152

in our mouse scRNA-seq dataset, both TMPRSS4 and ST14 were found to be present in

153

mature enterocytes and had an increased co-expression pattern with ACE2 than

154

TMPRSS2 (Fig. S3A).

155
156

To mechanistically dissect the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in IECs, we set up an

157

HEK293 ectopic expression system to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus infectivity.

158

As reported (2, 5), ACE2 conferred permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3B and

159

S3B). While TMPRSS2 alone did not mediate viral infection, co-expression of TMPRSS2

160

significantly enhanced ACE2-mediated infectivity (Fig. 3B). Importantly, we found that

161

expression of TMPRSS4 but not ST14 also resulted in a significant increase in the levels

162

of viral RNA and infectious virus titers in the presence of ACE2 (Fig. 3B and S3C).

163

TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS2 had an additive effect and mediated the maximal infectivity in

164

cell culture (Fig. 3B and S3C-E).

165
166

We reasoned that TMPRSS4 may function as a cell surface serine protease that

167

enhances S cleavage to promote viral entry. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed a

168

C-terminally Strep-tagged full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein in an HEK293 cell line that

169

stably expresses ACE2 with or without additional introduction of TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4.

170

In mock cells, we readily observed the full-length S and a cleaved product that

171

corresponded to the size of S1 fragment, presumably cleaved by furin protease that is

172

ubiquitously expressed (35). Importantly, the expression of TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4

173

enhanced S cleavage, as evidenced by the reduction of full-length S and increase of S2

174

levels (Fig. 3C).

175
176

Based on these results, we hypothesize that TMPRSS serine proteases assist virus

177

infection by inducing S cleavage and exposing the fusion peptide for efficient viral entry.

178

Indeed, TMPRSS4 expression did not affect virus binding (data not shown) whereas the

179

endocytosis was significantly enhanced (Fig. 3D). To examine S protein’s fusogenic

180

activity, we examined SARS-CoV-2 S mediated cell-cell fusion in the presence of

181

absence of TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4. Previous work with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

182

suggested S mediated membrane fusion takes place in a cell-type dependent manner

183

(36). We found that the ectopic expression of S alone was sufficient to induce syncytia

184

formation, independent of the virus infection (Fig. 3E). This process was dependent on a

185

concerted effort from ACE2 and TMPRSS serine proteases. TMPRSS4 expression

186

triggered S-mediated cell-cell fusion, although to a lesser extent than TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3E).

187

Collectively, we have shown that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 activate SARS-CoV-2 S and

188

enhance membrane fusion and viral endocytosis into host cells.

189
190

TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in enteroids

191
192

To further probe the TMPRSS mechanism of action and physiological relevance and to

193

recapitulate the IEC gene expression pattern in vivo (Fig. S3A), we designed an in vitro

194

co-culture system where ACE2 and S were expressed on target and donor cells

195

respectively. Based on the scRNA-seq data (Fig. S3A), we constructed an HEK293 stable

196

cell line that co-expresses ACE2 and TMPRSS4 to mimic mature enterocytes and another

197

HEK293 cell line that stably expresses TMPRSS2 to mimic goblet or other secretory IEC

198

types (Fig. 4A, left panel). Target cells were transfected with GFP and mixed at 1:1 ratio

199

with SARS-CoV-2 S containing donor cells that were transfected with TdTomato. We

200

found that TMPRSS4 was able to function in cis, i.e. on the same cells as ACE2, and

201

induced fusion of GFP positive cells (Fig. 4A, right panel), as was shown in Fig. 3E.

202

Importantly, we discovered that TMPRSS2 could act in trans and its expression on

203

adjacent cells markedly promoted the formation of stronger and larger cell-cell fusion (Fig.

204

4A, right panel).

205
206

Next, to determine the function of TMPRSS serine proteases in facilitating SARS-CoV-2

207

infection of primary human IECs, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-based method to genetically

208

delete TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4 in human duodenum enteroids. Efficient knockout was

209

confirmed by western blot (Fig. S4A). Importantly, abrogating TMPRSS4 expression led

210

to a 4-fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus replication in human enteroid, even

211

more significant than TMPRSS2 knockout (Fig. 4B), highlighting its importance in

212

mediating virus replication in primary cells.

213
214

In parallel to genetic depletion, we also tested the effect of pharmacological inhibition of

215

TMPRSS serine proteases on virus replication. We pre-treated enteroids with camostat

216

mesylate, a selective inhibitor of TMPRSS over other serine proteases including trypsin,

217

prostasin and matriptase (37). While camostat treatment significantly inhibited SARS-

218

CoV-2 chimera virus infection, soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) and E-64d, a cysteine

219

protease inhibitor that blocks cathepsin activity and has excellent inhibitory activity

220

against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (3), did not had a major impact on virus replication in

221

enteroids (Fig. 4C).

222
223

Taken together, our data support a model where SARS-CoV-2, at least in human IECs,

224

seems to be more reliant on the membrane-bound TMPRSS serine proteases (Fig. 4A,

225

left panel), as compared to SARS-CoV and other CoVs that can efficiently utilize both

226

TMPRSS2 and endosome-localized cathepsins as alternative routes of entry (38, 39).

227
228

SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated in the human GI tract

230

Our current results strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viruses are able to infect human

231

IECs apically and are released via the apical route into the lumen (Fig. 2). Human enteric

232

viruses that spread via the fecal-oral route typically withstand the harsh environment in

233

the GI tract, including the low pH of gastric fluids, bile and digestive enzymes in the small

234

intestine, dehydration and exposure to multiple bacterial by-products in the colon. We

235

sought to investigate the stability of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 chimera viruses in

236

different human gastric and intestinal fluids. Compared to rotavirus, a prototypic human

237

enteric virus known to successfully transmit fecal-orally (40), both CoV chimera viruses

238

quickly lost infectivity in a low pH condition (Fig. S5A). However, SARS-CoV-2-S exhibited

239

greater stability than SARS-CoV-S in human small intestinal fluids that contain biological

240

surfactants including taurocholic acid sodium salt and lecithin (Fig. 5A). Interestingly,

241

SARS-CoV-2-S chimera virus was not resistant to certain components in the human

242

colonic fluids (Fig. 5A). The virus titers decreased by 100-fold within 1 hour and no

243

infectious virus was detectable at the 24 hour time point (Fig. 5A). In contrast, rotavirus

244

remained stable in all gastric and enteric fluids tested (Fig. S5A-B).

245
246

Combined with the human enteroid results (Fig. 1-2), we hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-

247

2 has the potential to and likely does replicate in human IECs but then get quickly

248

inactivated the GI tract. We collected stool specimens from a small group of COVID-19

249

patients. From 3 out of 5 fecal samples, we detected high RNA copy numbers of SARS-

250

CoV-2 viral genome (Fig. 5B). However, we were unable to recover any infectious virus

251

using a highly sensitive cell-based assay (6).

Discussion

254
255

In this study we set out to address an important basic and clinically relevant question: Is

256

the persistent viral RNA seen in COVID-19 patients’ stool infectious and transmissible?

257

We showed that despite SARS-CoV-2’s ability to establish robust infection and replication

258

in human IECs (Fig. 1-2), the virus is rapidly inactivated by colonic fluids and we were

259

unable to detect infectious virus in fecal samples (Fig. 5). Thus, the large quantities of

260

viral RNA that transit through the GI tract and shed into the feces are likely not infectious

261

in nature. Due to the limitation of sample size, we cannot definitely conclude that fecal-

262

oral transmission of COVID-19 does not exist. However, our data is consistent with the

263

previous reports from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV publications which concluded that

264

despite long duration of viral RNA shedding, no infectious virus could be recovered from

265

the patients’ feces (41, 42).

266
267

Intriguingly, the small intestinal fluids, which contain taurocholic acid sodium salt and

268

lecithin, important surfactant components of the bile, did not inactivate virus as expected

269

(Fig. 5A). In addition, we also observed that the virus titers did not drop in the presence

270

of 0.03% bovine bile (data not shown), the highest concentration that did not induce

271

cytotoxicity, contradicting the known fragility of lipid bilayers and sensitivity to bile salts

272

which serve as detergents in gut. Recent studies showed a heavy glycosylation of SARS-

273

CoV-2 S protein (43) and it is possible the sugar coating conferred some stability against

274

the enzymatic digestion and bile salt solubilization. Two recent publications did

275

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 has unique stability in the environment, at least in a

laboratory setting (44, 45). Further work is needed to determine which bioactive(s) in the

277

colonic fluids that are absent from small intestinal fluids function to potentially disrupt viral

278

lipid membranes in vivo.

279
280

Mechanistically, recent work from multiple groups showed a key role of TMPRSS2 in

281

cleaving SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Here, we provide data that besides TMPRSS2,

282

TMPRSS4 also increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, at least in gut epithelial cells (Fig. 3-

283

4). We observed an intriguing additive effect of the two enzymes, as both target single

284

arginine or lysine residues (R/K↓). One may speculate that this synergy stems from a

285

distinct subcellular localization in neighboring cells (Fig. 4A). Future work with

286

recombinant proteins and enzymatic digestion may help address whether S cleavage is

287

sequential and whether the two enzymes act on different sites on the S protein.

288
289

Finally, we observed strong syncytia formation in human enteroids (Fig. S2B-C). These

290

results may have great implications for virus cell-cell spread and evasion from antibody

291

neutralization (46). It is unclear at this point whether the fused IECs will still undergo

292

anoikis or an alternative accelerated cell death, which may cause a breach in barrier

293

integrity and give rise to GI pathology seen in COVID-19 patients. It is possible that in the

294

small intestine, whereas SARS-CoV-2 is relatively stable, additional proteases such as

295

trypsin likely enhance viral pathogenesis by triggering more robust IEC fusion (Fig. S2A).

296

In this sense, although viruses are not released into the basolateral compartment (Fig.

297

2B), one can imagine that a leaky gut will allow the virus to disseminate to other systemic

298

organs including the lung and liver. This hypothesis is consistent with the clinical

299

observation that in some COVID-19 patients, the GI symptoms preceded the respiratory

300

illness (8, 9). Whether the gut serves as a primary site of infection and whether it

301

contributes to systemic diseases in individual patients require further studies using

302

appropriate animal models.

316

embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (CRL-1573) were originally obtained from American

317

Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in complete M199 medium and complete

318

DMEM medium, respectively. HEK293 cells stably expressing human ACE2 or TMPRSS2

319

were selected under 500 μg/ml G418. HEK293 cells stably expressing human ACE2 and

325

BioRelevant, UK and reconstituted based on the manufacturer’s instructions. Soybean

326

trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), camostat mesylate, and E-64d were purchased from Selleckchem.

327

Primary antibodies used in this study included: GAPDH (631402, Biolegend); GFP

328

(2555S, Cell Signaling); SARS-CoV-2-S (S1) (PA5-81795, Thermo Fisher); TMPRSS2

329

(sc-515727, Santa Cruz); TMPRSS4 (sc-376415, Santa Cruz); and V5 (13202S, Cell

331
332

Viruses: Human rotavirus WI61 strain was propagated as described before (48). VSV-

333

SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP and VSV-SARS-CoV-S-GFP were propagated in MA104 cells in

334

T175 flasks and virus sequences can be found in Table S1. Plaque assays were

335

performed in MA104 cells seeded in 6-well plates using an adapted version of the

336

rotavirus plaque assay protocol (19). TCID50 assays were performed in MA104 cells

337

seeded in flat-bottom 96-well plates using serial dilutions. Virus infections were performed

338

with the initial inoculum removed at 1 hour post adsorption.

One duodenum (#CD94), five ileum (#14-75, #211D, #262D-2, #265D, #251D-2), and

342

one colon (#235A) enteroids were used in this study. All enteroids were derived from de-

343

identified tissue from healthy, non-IBD subjects undergoing colonoscopy and provided

344

informed consent at Stanford University and Washington University in St. Louis. In brief,

345

enteroids were cultured in maintenance media (advanced DMEM/F12 media

346

supplemented with L-WRN-conditioned media that contains Wnt-3a, R-spondin 3, and

347

Noggin) in 3D Matrigel in 24-well plates (49). For passing enteroids, Y27632 and

348

CHIR99021 were added. For differentiation, conditioned media was replaced with 50%

349

Noggin in the form of recombinant proteins. Enteroids, when required, were digested into

350

single cells using TrypLE and seeded into collagen-coated transwells (0.33cm2, 0.4μm

351

pore size, Polycarbonate, Fisher #07-200-147) in ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 supplemented

352

maintenance media in 24-well plates. TEER measurement was performed using the

353

Millicell ERS-2 Voltohmmeter (Millipore). Enteroids in monolayers were used for virus

354

infection if the cultures had TEER greater than 1000 Ω.cm2 at 5 days post seeding. For

355

CRISPR/Cas9 knockout, enteroids in 3D Matrigel were digested with 5 mM EDTA and

356

transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding Cas9 and single-guide RNA against

357

TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4 (see Table S1) in the presence of polybrene (8 µg/ml). At 48

358

hours post transduction, puromycin (2 µg/ml) was added to the maintenance media.

359

Puromycin was adjusted to 1 µg/ml upon the death of untransduced control enteroids.

361

RNA extraction and quantitative PCR

362

Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse

363

transcription was performed with High Capacity RT kit and random hexamers as

364

previously described (50). QPCR was performed using the AriaMX (Agilent) with a 25 µl

365

reaction, composed of 50 ng of cDNA, 12.5 µl of Power SYBR Green master mix (Applied

366

Biosystems), and 200 nM both forward and reverse primers. All SYBR Green primers and

367

Taqman probes used in this study are listed in Table S1.

Bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy

370

For brightfield and epifluorescence, cultured cells or human enteroids were cultured in

371

24-well plates and images were taken by REVOLVE4 microscope (ECHO) with a 10X

372

objective. For confocal microscopy, enteroids were seeded into 8-well Nunc chamber

373

slides (Thermo Fisher), cultured under maintenance or differentiation conditioned,

374

infected with SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as

375

previously described (48). Samples were then stained with the following primary

376

antibodies or fluorescent dyes: ACE2 (sc-390851 AF594, Santa Cruz), DAPI (P36962,

377

Thermo Fisher), SARS-CoV-2 S (CR3022 human monoclonal antibody (51)), Villin (sc-

378

58897 AF488, Santa Cruz), and phalloidin (Alexa 647-conjugated, Thermo Fisher).

379

Stained cells were washed with PBS, whole mounted with Antifade Mountant, and imaged

380

with Zeiss LSM880 Confocal Microscope at the Molecular Microbiology imaging core

381

facility at Washington University in St. Louis. Z-stack was applied for imaging 3D human

382

enteroids. Images were analyzed by Volocity v6.3 (PerkinElmer) and quantification was

383

determined by CellProfiler (Broad Institute).

385

Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis

386

Small intestinal IEC isolation by EDTA-DTT extraction method and sorting were

387

performed as previously described (19, 52). Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Aqua

388

Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher) and live cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria II

389

flow cytometer. Preparation of single cell suspensions was performed at the Stanford

390

Genome Sequencing Service Center (GSSC). Cell suspensions were processed for

391

single-cell RNA-sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2

392

(10X Genomics, PN-120237) according to 10X Genomics guidelines. Libraries were

393

sequenced on an Illumnia NextSeq 500 using 150 cycles high output V2 kit (Read 1-26,

394

Read2-98 and Index 1-8 bases). The Cell Ranger package (v3.0.2) was used to align

395

high quality reads to the mouse genome (mm10). Normalized log expression values were

396

calculated using the scran package (53). Highly variable genes were identified using the

397

FindVariableGenes function (Seurat, v2.1) as described (54). Batch effects from technical

398

replicates were removed using the MNN algorithm as implemented in the batchelor

399

package’s (v1.0.1) fastMNN function. Imputed expression values were calculated using a

400

customized implementation (https://github.com/kbrulois/magicBatch) of the MAGIC

401

(Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells) algorithm (55) and optimized

402

parameters (t = 2, k = 9, ka = 3). Cells were classified as dividing or resting using a pooled

403

expression value for cell cycle genes (Satija Lab Website: regev_lab_cell_cycle_genes).

404

For UMAP and tSpace embeddings, cell cycle effects were removed by splitting the data

405

into dividing and resting cells and using the fastMNN function to align the dividing cells

406

with their resting counterparts. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the UMAP

407

algorithm and nearest neighbor alignments for trajectory inference and vascular modeling

408

were calculated using the tSpace algorithm. Pooled expression of all viral genes was

409

calculated using the AddModuleScore function from the Seurat package.
