Abstract

COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel
betacoronavirus discovered in December 2019 and closely related to the SARS
coronavirus (CoV). Both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry, recognizing it
with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein.
The S2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Experience with SARS
and MERS coronaviruses has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies
against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS)
and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against
SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human naïve universal antibody
gene libraries HAL9/10 anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction
with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more
than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2 in the scFv-Fc format,
assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a
molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1. All 17 scFv-Fc were able to bind
the isolated RBD, four of them with sub-nanomolar EC50. Furthermore, these scFv-Fc
neutralized active SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells.

In a final step, the

antibodies neutralizing best as scFv-Fc were converted into the IgG format. The antibody
STE73-2E9 showed neutralization of active SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 0.43 nM and is
binding to the ACE2-RBD interface. Universal libraries from healthy human donors offer
the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the
availability of material from recovered patients in a pandemic situation.

Main text
In 2015 Menachery et al. presciently wrote: “Our work suggests a potential risk of SARSCoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.” 1. Four years
later, a novel coronavirus causing a severe pneumonia was discovered and later named
SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak was initially noticed on a sea food market in Wuhan, Hubei
province (China) at the end of 2019. The disease was named COVID-19 (coronavirus
disease 2019) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Sequencing showed high identity
to bat coronaviruses (CoV, in particular RaTG13), beta-CoV virus causing human diseases
like SARS and MERS and, to a lesser extent, the seasonal CoV hCoV-OC43 and HCovHKU1 2,3. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV, binds to the human
zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed on numerous
cells, including lung cells, heart, kidney and intestine cells, thus initiating virus entry into
target cells. S protein consists of the N-terminal S1 subunit, which includes the receptor
binding domain (RBD), and the C-terminal S2 subunit which is anchored to the viral
membrane and is required for trimerization of spike itself and fusion of the virus and host
membrane

4–6

. The intracellular host enzyme furin cleaves the S protein between S1 and

S1 during viral formation and the membrane bound host protease TMPRSS2 is
responsible

for the proteolytic activation of the S2’ site, which is necessary for

conformational changes and viral entry

7–10

.

Antibodies against the spike protein of coronaviruses are potential candidates for
therapeutic development

. Antibodies against the S1 subunit, especially against RBD,

can potently neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS

. Monoclonal human antibodies against

SARS-CoV were also described to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, some of them were able
to neutralize SARS-CoV-2

CoV-2 were selected by rescreening memory B-cells from a SARS patient 17, selected from

antibodies were identified which efficiently inhibited the binding of the spike protein to
ACE2-expressing cells and blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. The best
antibody in the IgG format is a potential candidate for the clinical development of a passive
immunotherapy for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes.

Results

SARS CoV2 spike domains or subunits and human ACE2 were produced in insect cells
and mammalian cells
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 (aa319-591) according to Wrapp et al. 2020

33

, S1 subunit (aa14-

694), S1-S2 (aa14-1208, with proline substitutions at position 986 and 987 and “GSAS”
substitution at the furin site, residues 682-685) and extracellular domain of ACE2 receptor
were produced in insect cells using a plasmid based baculovirus free system

34

as well as

in Expi293F cells. All antigens with exception of S1-S2 were produced with human IgG1 Fc
part, murine IgG2a Fc part or with 6xHis tag in both expression systems. S1-S2 was only
produced with 6xHis tag. The extracellular domain of ACE2 was produced with human
IgG1 Fc part or mouse IgG2a in Expi293F cells and 6xHis tagged in insect cells. The
yields of all produced proteins are given in Table 1. A graphical overview on all produced
proteins is given in Supplementary Data 1. The expressed proteins were analyzed by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Supplementary Data 2).
S1 as well as S1-S2 were more efficiently produced in insect cells compared to Expi293F
cells. RBD-SD1 was produced well in both production systems. The binding of the
produced spike domains/proteins to ACE2 was validated by ELISA and flow cytometry
analysis on ACE2 positive cells (Table 1).

Antibodies were selected by phage display
Antibodies were selected against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit in four panning rounds in
microtiter plates. The following single clone screening was performed by antigen ELISA in
96 well MTPs, using soluble monoclonal scFv produced in E. coli. Subsequently, DNA

encoding for the binders was sequenced and unique antibodies were recloned as scFv-Fc
fusions.
In detail, three panning strategies were compared. In a first approach (STE70) the lambda
(HAL9) and kappa (HAL10) libraries were combined and the antigen S1-hFc (with furin
site, produced in High Five cells) was immobilized in PBS. Here, only seven unique
antibodies were identified. In a second approach, the selection was performed separately
for HAL10 (STE72) and HAL9 (STE73) using S1-hFc as antigen (with furin site, SEC
purified, immobilized in carbonate buffer). Here, 90 unique antibodies were selected from
HAL10 and 209 from HAL9. In a third approach (STE77 and STE78), S1-hFc produced in
Expi293F cells was used (immobilized in carbonate buffer). Here, the panning resulted in
only three unique antibodies that were not further analyzed in inhibition assays. An
overview is given in Table 2.
The antibody subfamily distribution was analyzed and compared to the subfamily
distribution in the HAL9/10 library and in vivo (Fig. 1). The phage display selected
antibodies mostly originated from the main gene families VH1 and VH3. Only few
antibodies were found using VH4. In 96 of the 309 selected antibodies (31%), the V-gene
VH3-23 was used. The V-gene distribution in the lambda light chains was similar to the
distribution in the original library. Only antibodies comprising the V-gene VL6-57 were
selected from the lambda library HAL10. In antibodies selected from the kappa library, VK2
and VK4 were underrepresented.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 scFv-Fc were produced transiently in mammalian cells
In the interest of rapid throughput to quickly address the growing impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, only a selection of the unique antibodies was chosen for production as scFv-Fc
and characterization. Antibodies with potential glycosylation sites in the CDRs, identified

by in silico analysis, were excluded. A total of 109 scFv-Fc antibodies were produced in 5
mL culture scale, with yields ranging from of 20 to 440 mg/L.

Antibodies inhibit the binding of spike to ACE2 positive cells in the scFv-Fc format
To further select potential therapeutic candidates, an inhibition assay was established
using flow cytometry of ACE2-positive cells, measuring competition of S1-S2 trimer binding
by scFv-Fc antibodies. The entire spike protein ectodomain was used for this inhibition
assay for optimal representation of the viral binding. In a first screening, the 109 scFv-Fc
were tested at 1500 nM (molar ratio antibody: S1-S2 30:1). 17 antibodies with inhibition
better than 75% were selected for further analysis (Fig. 2A, Table 3 and Supplementary
Data 3).
To further characterize these 17 antibodies, their inhibition of ACE2 binding was assessed
at concentrations from 1500 nM to 4.7 nM (from 30:1 to ~1:10 Ab:antigen molar ratio) with
the same flow cytometry assay (Fig. 2B and Table 3). Antibodies STE72-8E1 and STE732E9 showed 50% inhibition of ACE2 binding at a molar ratio of 0.8 antigen binding sites
per spike monomer. For further validation of the direct RBD: ACE2 inhibition, we performed
the same assay using a RBD-mFc construct (Fig. 2C). With the exception of two
antibodies (STE72-1G5 and STE73-6B10) all antibodies showed high inhibition of binding
with molar ratios of 0.3-0.6:1 for STE72-4E12, STE72-8A2, STE72-8A6, STE73-2B2,
STE73-2G8 and STE73-9G3.
The inhibition of the 17 antibodies was further validated on human Calu-3 cells, which
naturally express ACE2

using RBD-mFc (Supplementary Data 4A) and S1-S2-His

(Supplementary Data 4B) showing a stronger inhibition on Calu-3 compared to the
transiently overexpressing ACE2 positive Expi293F cells. The Expi293F system allowed
an improved estimation of inhibition potency when using the complete S1-S2 spike protein,

because the S1-S2 was directly labeled with a fluorophore and the signals were not
amplified in comparison to RBD with a murine Fc and a fluorophore labeled secondary
antibody. Further, ACE2-expressing Expi293F cells present a much higher amount of
ACE2-receptor on their surface compared to Calu-3, due to the CMV-mediated expression
(data not shown). Taken together these data show that all 17 inhibiting antibodies selected
against S1 directly interfered with RBD-ACE2 binding.

Determination of EC50 of the inhibiting antibodies to RBD, S1 and S1-S2
The EC50 of the inhibiting scFv-Fc on RBD, S1 (without furin site) and S1-S2 spike was
measured by ELISA. All inhibiting antibodies bound the isolated RBD (Fig. 3), identifying it
as their target on the viral surface. Most of the inhibiting antibodies showed a half-maximal
binding in the subnanomolar range for RBD. While STE72-2G4 showed sub-nanomolar
EC50 values for RBD and S1, it was discarded due to noticeable cross-reactivity to mFc.
The EC50 on the S1-S2 spike trimer was reduced for most of the antibodies, in
comparison to the isolated RBD or S1.

ScFv-Fc combinations show synergistic effects in inhibition assays
Combinations of best-inhibiting scFv-Fc were tested in the flow cytometry inhibition assay
using 1500 nM antibody and 50 nM S1-S2 spike (Supplementary Data 5). Some of the
combinations showed an increase of inhibition compared to the same amount of individual
antibodies.

Anti-RBD scFv-Fc neutralize active SARS-CoV-2
All 17 inhibiting scFv-Fc were screened in a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based neutralization
assay using 250 pfu/well SARS-CoV-2 Münster/FI110320/1/2020 and 1 µg/mL (~10 nM)

scFv-Fc (Fig. 4A, Table 3). VeroE6 cells showed pronounced CPE characterised by
rounding and detachment clearly visible in phase contrast microscopy upon SARS-CoV-2
infection within 4 days, while uninfected cells maintained an undisturbed confluent
monolayer. Virus inoculum pre-incubated with anti-RBD antibodies led to decreased CPE
in varying degrees quantified by automated image analysis for cell confluence. All 17
antibodies showed neutralization in this assay. Fig. 4B shows examples for strong (STE736C8) and weak (STE73-2C2) neutralizing antibodies and controls.

Binding, inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in the IgG format
Eleven scFv-Fc showing a neutralization efficacy of 90% according to the CPE-based
neutralization assay were converted into the IgG format. First, their binding was analyzed
by titration ELISA on RBD, S1 and S1-S2 (Supplementary Data 6, Table 3). Three
antibodies lost binding after conversion to IgG (STE72-8A2, STE72-8A6 and STE73-6B10,
data not shown), others showed reduced binding of different degrees, while three
antibodies retained their binding (STE70-1E12, STE72-4E12 and STE73-2E9). In the next
step, the antibodies were tested in the cell-based inhibition assay using RBD (Figure 5A)
or S1-S2 (Figure 5B). Here, the inhibition was confirmed for STE73-2E9, -9G3, -2G8.
STE73-1B6 showed inhibition of RBD comparable to the latter antibodies, but its activity
was almost absent on S1-S2, thus it was not further considered.

Inhibiting IgGs are binding at the RBD-ACE2 interface
The efficiently inhibiting IgGs STE73-2E9, STE73-2G8 and STE73-9G3 were analyzed for
their binding to various S1 subunit variants harbouring a panel of recently reported
mutations in RBD region and the D614G mutation. Three assays were employed: 1, ELISA
(Figure 6A), 2, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and 3, bScreen protein array with S1

proteins from different sources. All three antibodies lost binding to RBD mutations in the
region aa483-486 directly at the RBD-ACE2 interface, showing that mutations in that
region affect their epitope on the antigen. There were only minor differences between
different approaches, e.g. at positions aa439 and aa476 for STE73-2E9. We then used
this information to guide and validate computational docking simulations followed by
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations according to protocols developed and well
established in our group

35

, obtaining three-dimensional atomic models of the antibody-

RBD interaction for these three antibodies (Figure 6B). The binding models of the three
antibodies to the spike ectodomain are shown in Supplementary Data 7.

STE73-2E9 neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the IgG format
As a final step, STE73-2E9, -9G3, -2G8 antibodies were analyzed in a plaque assay using
the

patient

isolate

SARS-CoV-2

(Münster/FI110320/1/2020)

to

determine

their

neutralization potency. STE73-2E9 showed an IC50 of 0.43 nM in this assay.
Unfortunately, STE73-9G3 and -2G8 did not show high neutralization as IgG (Figure 7A).

Analysis of STE73-2E9 crossreactivity with other coronoviruses
The neutralizing antibody STE73-2E9 was further characterized by titration ELISA on
SARS-CoV-2 spike recombinant constructs (Figure 7B) and S1 subunits from different
coronaviruses (Figure 7C) showing that STE73-2E9 is binding specifically SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein in the RBD region. The specific binding to S1/RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was
further confirmed by the bScreen protein array binding analysis (data not shown).

The affinity of STE73-2E9 was determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance as 2x10 -9 M
for RBD-SD1 (Figure 7D) and 9.25-10 M for the complete spike protein (Figure 7E).

Aggregation behaviour of STE73-2E9
The aggregation behaviour of biologicals is a key factor for therapeutic development.
STE73-2E9 shows now relevant aggregation under normal conditions (pH7.4, RT in PBS),
heat stress conditions (pH7.4, 45°C, 24h in PBS) and pH stress (pH3, 24h, RT),
implicating that it has benign general physicochemical properties that are a prerequisite for
the development into a passive vaccine (supplementary data 8).

Discussion
For 130 years, antibodies in animal sera or convalescent human plasma were successfully
used for the treatment of infectious diseases, starting with the work of Emil von Behring
und Shibasaburo Kitasato against diphtheria

35

. However, the efficacy of human plasma

derived from convalescent donors depends on the viral pathogen. In case of Ebola, the
survival upon treatment with convalescent human plasma was not significantly improved
over the control group

36

. On the other hand, reduced mortality and safety was shown for

convalescent plasma transfer in case of influenza A H1N1 in 2009

37,38

. This approach was

also used against emerging coronaviruses. While the outcomes were not significantly
improved in a very limited number of MERS patients

39

, the treatment was successful for

SARS 40,41. This approach was also used for COVID-19 with promising results 42. The mode
of action of these polyclonal antibody preparations may vary, including virus neutralization,
Fcγ receptor binding mediated phagocytosis or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity as
well as complement activation

43–45

. In any serum therapy, the composition and efficacy of

convalescent plasma is expected to differ from donor to donor, as well as batch to batch,
and sera must be carefully controlled for viral contaminations (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis viruses)
and neutralization potency. A convalescent patient can provide 400-800 mL plasma, with
250-300 mL of plasma typically needed per treatment. With two rounds of treatment per
patient, this is a grave limitation, since one donor can only provide material for 1-2 patients
42,43

. Human or humanized monoclonal antibodies are a powerful alternative to polyclonal

antibodies derived from convalescent plasma. Following this approach, the humanized
antibody Palivizumab was approved in 2009 for treatment and prevention of Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections

46

. Other antibodies against viral diseases successfully

tested in clinical studies are mAb114 and REGN-EB3 against Ebola disease 24.

Phage display derived antibodies are typically well established medications: twelve such
antibodies are approved by EMA/FDA at the time of writing, a significant increase
compared to the six such antibodies approved in 2016

47

. In this work, we used phage

display to isolate monoclonal human antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 from
a universal, naive antibody gene library that was generated from healthy donors before the
emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This allowed selection of human antibodies against
this virus without the necessity to obtain material from COVID-19 infected individuals.
While most antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from convalescent patients
with few exceptions

20,21,48,49

our approach demonstrates that human antibodies with

functional properties matching those of the antibodies isolated from convalescent patients
can be generated without the necessity to wait for material from COVID-19 infected
individuals. Therefore, this strategy offers a very fast additional opportunity to respond to
future pandemics.
As the human receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2 3, we focused on
antibodies which directly block the interaction of the spike protein with this receptor and
antibodies preventing ACE2 binding were shown to potently neutralize the closely related

. 309 unique fully human monoclonal antibodies were generated using

different panning strategies. The S1 subunit produced in insect cells was better suited for
antibody selection than the S1 subunit produced in mammalian cells. The V-gene
distribution of the selected anti-Spike antibodies is largely in accordance with the V-gene
subfamily distribution shown by Kügler et al

50

for antibodies selected against 121 other

antigens from HAL9/10. Only the VH1 subfamily was over-represented and VH4 and
Vkappa4 subfamilies were rarely selected despite their presence in the HAL libraries. The
most frequently used V-gene was VH3-30. Interestingly, an increased use of this V-gene in
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was also described by Robbiani et al. 2020 51 for anti-RBD B-

cells selected from COVID-19 patients. By contrast, the second most selected V-gene was
VH3-53, which was selected in our approach only once. Robbiani et al. also described an
overrepresented use of VL6-57, as found in our antibodies as well. However, it has to be
noted that VL6 is also overrepresented in our naïve library compared to its in vivo
occurrence.
From the initial 309 scFv, 109 were recloned in the scFv-Fc IgG-like bivalent format. Their
ability to inhibit binding of fluorescently labelled S1-S2 trimer to ACE2 expressing cells was
assessed by flow cytometry. The half-maximal inhibition of the best inhibiting 17 scFv-Fc
was measured both with the spike trimer and isolated RBD. Significantly, some of the
antibodies showed half-maximal inhibition at a ratio around 1:1 - in certain cases even
better - when calculated per individual binding site (antigen binding site:spike
monomer/RBD). A similar molar ratio of 1:1 was demonstrated by Miethe et al. 2014 for
inhibition of botulinum toxin A 52. In the trimeric spike protein, the RBD can be in an “up”
(open) or “down” (close) position. The “down” conformation can not bind to ACE2, in
contrast to the less stable “up” conformation

33

. The RBDs can be in different

conformations on the same spike trimer, which offers a possible explanation for the
observed effective antibody to spike molar ratios lower than 1:1. This is in accordance with
the cryo-EM images recorded by Walls et al. 4, where they could find half of the recorded
trimers with one RBD in the open conformation. We observed that molar ratios for half
maximal inhibition were lower for RBD compared to spike protein. For some antibodies,
approximately 0.5 antigen binding sites were needed to achieve a 50% inhibition. The fact
that the antibodies are more efficient at inhibiting RBD binding to ACE2 rather than S1-S2
trimer binding can be explained with the higher affinity of the antibodies for the isolated
RBD compared to the trimeric spike, which in turn points to the presence of partially or
completely inaccessible epitopes on the trimer, an occurrence seen in other viruses. This

who also showed a lower affinity of the

antibody S309 for spike compared to RBD.
Inhibition of ACE2 binding was stronger on the human lung cells Calu-3, which better
represent the in vivo situation than transiently ACE2 overexpressing cells. Nevertheless,
we did the titration assays on ACE2 overexpressing Expi293F cells because these
seemed to allow a better quantitative discrimination of inhibiting potency.
Antibody combinations can have a synergistic effect as previously described for toxins and
viruses

32,53–55

. This approach may also avoid formation of viral escape mutants. Here, the

best combinations showed a significantly improved inhibition efficacy, at least when using
an excess of antibodies (Ab:Agmolar ratio 30:1).
All of the 17 scFv-Fc were tested in neutralization assays using a SARS-CoV-2 strain
isolated from a patient and all antibodies showed a degree of neutralization in this assay.
While this study did not aim to define the lowest effective concentration of individual
antibodies in limiting dilution conditions, all tested antibodies showed a clear and
measurable effect at a relatively low concentration. Therefore, our approach provided a
rapid selection of antiviral antibodies.
In a next step, we converted eleven antibodies with the best neutralization efficacy
according to the cytopathic assay into the IgG format. It was completely unexpected that
most antibodies lost efficacy in the inhibition assay after conversion from scFv-Fc to IgG
including antibodies like STE70-1E12 without loss of affinity according to the titration
ELISA. These results are in contrast to former results where none

of antibodies lost efficacy after conversion from scFv-Fc to IgG.

Nevertheless, three antibodies showed a good inhibition in the cell-based assay and did
not bind to the region of aa483-486 known for RBD mutations from publications

RBD, thus likely achieving direct inhibition of virus-ACE2 interaction. The binding sites of

also overlap with the RBD ACE2 binding

interface. The neutralizing antibody STE73-2E9 was specific for SARS-CoV-2 and we
conclude that this antibody is a suitable candidate for the development of passive
immunotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. It could be used therapeutically to prevent
individuals from being hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), but also prophylactically,
to protect health care workers or risk groups that do not respond to vaccination. Before
clinical application, the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE) has to
be considered for COVID-19. In contrast to antibodies against Ebola where ADCC is
important for protection
may lead to ADE

described that animals immunized with RBD SARS-CoV-2 did not mediate ADE and
suggested for vaccines the use of RBD, some of the monoclonal antibodies we analyzed
in this study lead to an increased binding of the spike protein to ACE2 positive cells. A
possible explanation could be multimerization of the spike by antibody ‘cross-linking’ in this
assay or the stabilization of an infection-promoting conformation by the antibodies. These
aspects need to be carefully considered in any development of therapeutic antibodies, we
suggest to focus on RBD and/or the use of silenced Fc parts with deleted Fcγ and C1q
binding 65–67 for safety reasons.
In conclusion, we report the successful isolation and characterization of a fully human,
recombinant anti-spike neutralizing monoclonal antibody from naïve phage display
libraries. Our approach demonstrates how neutralizing antibodies can be efficiently
selected in a rapid time frame and without the need of convalescent patient material.

Methods

Design of expression vectors
Production in Expi293F cells was performed using pCSE2.5-His-XP, pCSE2.6-hFc-XP or
pCSE2.6-mFc-XP

68

where the respective single chain variable fragment of the antibodies

or antigens were inserted by NcoI/NotI (NEB Biolabs) digestion. Antigen production in High
Five insect cells was performed using NcoI/NotI compatible variants of the OpiE2 plasmid
69

containing an N-terminal signal peptide of the mouse Ig heavy chain, the respective

antigen and C-terminal either 6xHis-tag, hFc or mFc. Single point mutations in S1-HIS
constructs were inserted through site-directed mutagenesis using overlapping primers
according to Zheng et al.

70

with slight modifications: S7 Fusion polymerase (Mobidiag,

Espoo, Finland) with the provided GC buffer and 3%DMSO was used for the amplification
reaction.

Production of antigens in insect cells
Different domains or subunits of the Spike protein (GenBank: MN908947), S1 subunit
mutants and the extracellular domain of ACE2 receptor (GenBank NM_021804.3) were
Baculovirus-free produced in High Five cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by transient
transfection as previously described in Bleckmann et al.

34

. Briefly, High Five cells were

cultivated at 27°C, 110 rpm in ExCell405 media (Sigma) and kept at a cell density between
0.3 – 5.5 x106 cells/mL. For transfection cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh
media to a density of 4x106 cells/mL and transfected with 4 µg plasmid/mL and 16 µg/mL
of PEI 40 kDa (Polysciences). 4 h up to 24 h after transfection cells were fed with 75% of
the transfection volume. At 48 h after transfection cell culture medium was doubled. Cell

supernatant was harvested five days after transfection in a two step centrifugation (4 min
at 180xg and 20 min at above 3500xg) and 0.2 µm filtered for purification.

Production of antigens and scFv-Fc in mammalian cells
Antibodies, different domains or subunits of the Spike protein and the extracellular domain
of ACE2 were produced in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expi293F cells were
cultured at 37°C, 110 rpm and 5% CO2 in Gibco FreeStyle F17 expression media (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 8 mM Glutamine and 0.1% Pluronic F68 (PAN
Biotech). At the day of transfection cell density was between 1.5 - 2x10 6 cells/mL and
viability at least above 90%. For formation of DNA:PEI complexes 1 µg DNA/mL
transfection volume and 5 µg of 40 kDa PEI (Polysciences) were first diluted separately in
5% transfection volume in supplemented F17 media. DNA and PEI was then mixed and
incubated ~25 min at RT before addition to the cells. 48 h later the culture volume was
doubled by feeding HyClone SFM4Transfx-293 media (GE Healthcare) supplemented with
8 mM Glutamine. Additionally, HyClone Boost 6 supplement (GE Healthcare) was added
with 10% of the end volume. One week after transfection supernatant was harvested by 15
min centrifugation at 1500xg.

Protein purification
Protein purification was performed depending on the production scale in either 24 well filter
plate with 0.5 mL resin (10 mL scale) or 1 mL column on Äkta go (Cytiva), Äkta Pure
(Cytiva) or Profina System (BIO-RAD). MabSelect SuRe or HiTrap Fibro PrismA (Cytiva)
was used as resins for Protein A purification. For His-tag purification of Expi293F
supernatant HisTrap FF Crude column (Cytiva) and for His-tag purification of insect cell
supernatant HisTrap excel column (Cytiva) was used. All purifications were performed

according to the manufactures manual. Indicated antigens were further purified by size
exclusion chromatography by a 16/600 Superdex 200 kDa pg (Cytiva). All antigens,
antibodies and scFv-Fc were run on Superdex 200 Increase 10/300GL (Cytiva) on Äkta or
HPLC (Techlab) on an AdvanceBio SEC 300Å 2.7 µm, 7.8x300 mm (Agilent) for quality
control.

Validation of spike protein binding to ACE2
ACE2 binding to the produced antigens was confirmed in ELISA (enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay) and on cells in flow cytometry. For ELISA, 200 ng ACE2-mFc per
well was immobilized on a Costar High binding 96 well plate (Corning, Costar) at 4°C over
night. Next, the wells were blocked with 350 µL 2% MBPST (2% (w/v) milk powder in PBS;
0.05% Tween20) for 1 h at RT and then washed 3 times with H2O and 0.05% Tween20
(BioTek Instruments, EL405). Afterwards, the respective antigen was added at the
indicated concentrations and incubated 1 h at RT prior to another 3 times washing step.
Finally, the antigen was detected using mouse-anti-polyHis conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) (1:20000, A7058, Sigma) for His-tagged antigens, goat-anti-mIgG(Fc)
conjugated with HRP (1:42000, A0168, Sigma) for mFc tagged antigen versions or goatanti-hIgG(Fc) conjugated with HRP (1:70000, A0170, Sigma) if hFc-tagged antigens had to
be detected. Bound antigens were visualized with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
(20 parts TMB solution A (30 mM Potassium citrate; 1 % (w/v) Citric acid (pH 4.1)) and 1
part TMB solution B (10 mM TMB; 10% (v/v) Acetone; 90% (v/v) Ethanol; 80 mM H2O2
(30%)) were mixed). After addition of 1 N H2SO4 to stop the reaction, absorbance at
450 nm with a 620 nm reference wavelength was measured in an ELISA plate reader
(BioTek Instruments, Epoch).

To verify the ACE2-antigen interaction on living cells, Expi293F cells were transfected
according to the protocol above using pCSE2.5-ACE2 fl-His and 5% eGFP plasmid. Two
days after transfection, purified S1-S2-His, S1-His or RBD-His were labelled using
Monolith NTTM His-Tag Labeling Kit RED-tris-NTA (Nanotemper) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Fc-tagged ligand versions were labelled indirectly by using goatanti-mFc-APC (Dianova) or mouse anti-hFcγ-APC (Biolegend) antibody. 100, 50 and
25 nM of antigen were incubated with 5x10 5 ACE2-expressing or non-transfected
Expi293F cells (negative control) 50 min on ice. After two washing steps, fluorescence was
measured in MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec.).

Antibody selection using phage display
The antibody selection was performed as described previously with modifications

71

. In

brief, for panning procedure, the antigen was immobilized on a High binding 96 well plate
(Corning, Costar). 5 µg of S1-hFc (produced in High Five cells) was diluted in carbonate
puffer (50 mM NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6) and coated onto the wells at 4°C overnight. Next,
the wells were blocked with 350 µL 2% MBPST (2% (w/v) milk powder in PBS; 0.05%
Tween20) for 1 h at RT and then washed 3 times with PBST (PBS; 0.05% Tween20).
Before adding the libraries to the coated wells, the libraries (5x10 10 phage particles) were
preincubated with 5 µg of an unrelated scFv-Fc and 2% MPBST on blocked wells for 1 h at
RT, to deprive libraries of human Fc fragment binders. The libraries were transferred to the
antigen-coated wells, incubated for 2 h at RT and washed 10 times. Bound phage were
eluted with 150 µL trypsin (10 µg/mL) at 37°C, 30 minutes and used for the next panning
round. The eluted phage solution was transferred to a 96 deep well plate (Greiner BioOne, Frickenhausen, Germany) and incubated with 150 µL E. coli TG1 (OD600 = 0.5) firstly
for 30 min at 37°C, then 30 min at 37°C and 650 rpm to infect the phage particles. 1 mL

2xYT-GA (1.6% (w/v) Tryptone; 1 % (w/v) Yeast extract; 0.5% (w/v) NaCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM
D-Glucose, 100 µg/mL ampicillin) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 650 rpm,
followed by addition of 1x1010 cfu M13KO7 helper phage. Subsequently, the infected
bacteria were incubated for 30 min at 37°C followed by 30 min at 37°C and 650 rpm
before centrifugation for 10 min at 3220xg. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet
resuspended in fresh 2xYT-AK (1.6% (w/v) Tryptone; 1 % (w/v) Yeast extract; 0.5% (w/v)
NaCl (pH 7.0), 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 50 µg/mL kanamycin). The antibody phage were
amplified overnight at 30°C and 650 rpm and used for the next panning round. In total four
panning rounds were performed. In each round, the stringency of the washing procedure
was increased (20x in panning round 2, 30x in panning round 3, 40x in panning round 4)
and the amount of antigen was reduced (2.5 µg in panning round 2, 1.5 µg in panning
round 3 and 1 µg in panning round 4). After the fourth as well as third panning round single
clones containing plates were used to select monoclonal antibody clones for the screening
ELISA.

Screening of monoclonal recombinant binders using E. coli scFv supernatant
Soluble antibody fragments (scFv) were produced in 96-well polypropylene MTPs (U96
PP, Greiner Bio-One) as described before

55,71

. Briefly, 150 μL 2xYT-GA was inoculated

with the bacteria bearing scFv expressing phagemids. MTPs were incubated overnight at
37°C and 800 rpm in a MTP shaker (Thermoshaker PST-60HL-4, Lab4You, Berlin,
Germany). A volume of 180 μL 2xYT-GA in a PP-MTP well was inoculated with 20 μL of
the overnight culture and grown at 37°C and 800 rpm for 90 minutes (approx. OD 600 of
0.5). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3220xg and the supernatant
was discarded. To induce expression of the antibody genes, the pellets were resuspended
in 200 μL 2xYT supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μM isopropyl-beta D

thiogalacto pyranoside (IPTG) and incubated at 30°C and 800 rpm overnight. Bacteria
were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 3220xg and 4°C.
For the ELISA, 100 ng of antigen was coated on 96 well microtiter plates (High binding,
Greiner) in PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. After coating, the wells were blocked with
2% MPBST for 1 h at RT, followed by three washing steps with H2O and 0.05% Tween20.
Supernatants containing secreted monoclonal scFv were mixed with 2% MPBST (1:2) and
incubated onto the antigen coated plates for 1 h at 37°C followed by three H2O and 0.05%
Tween20 washing cycles. Bound scFv were detected using murine mAb 9E10 which
recognizes the C-terminal c-myc tag (1:50 diluted in 2% MPBST) and a goat anti-mouse
serum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (A0168, Sigma) (1:42000 dilution in
2% MPBST). Bound antibodies were visualized with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
(20 parts TMB solution A (30 mM Potassium citrate; 1% (w/v) Citric acid (pH 4.1)) and 1
part TMB solution B (10 mM TMB; 10% (v/v) Acetone; 90% (v/v) Ethanol; 80 mM H2O2
(30%)) were mixed). After stopping the reaction by addition of 1 N H2SO4, absorbance at
450 nm with a 620 nm reference was measured in an ELISA plate reader (Epoch, BioTek).
Monoclonal binders were sequenced and analyzed using VBASE2 (www.vbase2.org)

72

and possible glycosylation positions in the CDRS were analyzed according to Lu et al 73.

Inhibition of S1-S2 binding to ACE2 expressing cells using MacsQuant
The inhibition tests in cytometer on EXPI293F cells were performed based on the protocol
for validation of spike protein binding to ACE2 (see above) but only binding to S1-S2-His
and RBD-mFc antigen (High Five cell produced) was analyzed. The assay was done in
two setups. In the first setup 50 nM antigen was incubated with min. 1 µM of different
scFv-Fc and the ACE2 expressing cells. The resulting median antigen fluorescence of
GFP positive living single cells was measured. For comparison of the different scFv-Fc first

the median fluorescence background of cells without antigen was subtracted, second it
was normalized to the antigen signal where no antibody was applied. All scFv-Fc showing
an inhibition in this setup were further analyzed by titration (max. 1500 nM- 4.7 nM) on S1S2-His (High Five cell produced), respectively on RBD-mFc (max. 100 nM-0.03 nM). The
IC50 was calculated using the equation f(x)=Amin+(Amax-Amin)/(1+(x0/x)^h)^s and
parameters from Origin. In addition, pairwise combinations (max. 750 nM of each scFv-Fc)
of the different inhibiting scFv-Fc were tested.

Dose dependent binding of the antibodies (scFv-Fc or IgG format) in titration ELISA
ELISA were essentially performed as described above in “Screening of monoclonal
recombinant binders using E.coli scFv supernatant”. For titration ELISA the purified scFvhFc were titrated from 3.18 µg/mL- 0.001 ng/mL on 30ng/well of the following antigens:
S1-S2-His (High Five cell produced), RBD-mFc (High Five cell produced), S1-mFc (High
Five cell produced) and TUN219-2C1-mFc (as control for unspecific Fc binding). In
addition, all scFv-hFc were also tested only at the highest concentration (3.18 µg/mL) for
unspecific cross-reactivity on Expi293F cell lysate (10 4cells/well), BSA (1% w/v) and
lysozyme. ScFv-hFc or IgG were detected using goat-anti-hIgG(Fc)-HRP (1:70000, A0170,
Sigma). Titration assays were performed using 384 well microtiter plates (Costar) using
Precision XS microplate sample processor (BioTek), EL406 washer dispenser (BioTek)
and BioStack Microplate stacker (BioTek). EC50 were calculated with by GraphPad Prism

HCoV NL63, HCoV 229E were acquired commercially (Sino Biologicals products 40591V08H, 40150-V08B1, 40069-V08H, 40021-V08H, 40601-V08H, 40600-V08H).

Antibody structures and computational docking studies
The antibody structures were modelled according to the canonical structure method using
the RosettaAntibody program

74

as previously described

75

and docked to the experimental

structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain (RBD, PDBid: 6M17) 6.
Docking was performed using the RosettaDock 3.12 software

76

as previously described 77.

Briefly, each antibody was manually placed with the CDR loops facing the RBD region
containing the residues identified by the peptide mapping experiment. The two partners
were moved away from each other by 25Å and then brought together by the computational
docking algorithm, obtaining thousands of computationally generated complexes (typically
15,000). The antibody/RBD complexes were structurally clustered and then selected
according to the scoring function (an estimate of energetically favourable solutions) and
agreement with the peptide mapping data. Selected complexes were further optimized by
a docking refinement step and molecular dynamics simulations.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in cell culture
VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were seeded at a density of 6*10 4/well onto cell culture
96-well plates (Nunc, Cat.#167008). Two days later, cells reached 100% confluence. For
neutralization, antibodies (1 µg/ml final concentration) were mixed with the virus inoculum

IncuCyte S3 (10x objective, two hours image intervals, 4 images per well) housed in a
HeraCell 150i incubator (37°C, 100% humidity, 5% CO2). Image data was quantified with
the IncuCyte S3 GUI tools measuring the decrease of confluence concomitant with the
cytopathic effect of the virus in relation to uninfected controls and controls without antibody
and analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8. Given is the median of the inhibition.
For titration, antibodies were diluted in 1/√10 steps and mixed with a fixed inoculum of
SARS-CoV-2 (100-150 pfu) in a total volume of 500 µl of Vero E6 medium. After one hour
incubation at 37°C, cells were infected with the antibody/virus mix, incubated for one hour
and then overlaid with Vero E6 medium containing 1.5% methyl-cellulose. Three days
postinfection, wells were imaged using a Sartorius IncuCyte S3 (4x objective, whole-well
scan) and plaques were counted from these images.

Cloning and production of IgG
For IgG production, selected antibodies were converted into the human IgG1 format by
subcloning of VH in the vector pCSEH1c (heavy chain) and VL in the vector
pCSL3l/pCSL3k (light chain lambda/kappa)

procedure with Esp3I restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). EXPI293F (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) cells were transfected with 12.5 µg of both vectors in parallel in a 1:1
ratio. For production, the transfected EXPI293F cells were cultured in chemically defined
medium F17 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.1% pluronic F68 (PANBiotech,) and 7.5 mM L-glutamine (Merck) for seven days. A subsequent protein A
purification was performed as described above.

Affinity determination by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
The antibodies binding properties were analyzed at 25 °C on a Biacore ™ 8K instrument
(GE Healthcare) using 10mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA and 0.005%
Tween-20 as running buffer. SARS-CoV2 RBDs, wild-type and different mutants, or full Sprotein, were immobilized on the surface of a CM5 chip through standard amine coupling.
Increasing concentration of antibodies (6.25-12.5-25-50-100nM) were injected using a
Single-cycle kinetics setting and analyte responses were corrected for unspecific binding
and buffer responses. Curve fitting and data analysis were performed with Biacore™
Insight Evaluation Software.

Analysis of binding to RBD mutants by protein array
2 nL of the proteins were printed as quadruplicates onto PDITC coated bScreen slides with
a pitch of 700µm using a SciFlexArrayer (Scienion AG) in non-contact mode. The following
proteins were spotted on the array: S1-S2, SARS-CoV-2, High5 (this work); S1, SARSCoV-2, HEK293 (Sino Biological 40591-V08H); S1, SARS-CoV-2, Baculovirus (Sino

value from 30s to 20s before the association phase from the signal mean value from 20s
to 30s after the association phase.

Antibody structures and computational docking studies
The antibody structures were modelled according to the canonical structure method using
the RosettaAntibody program

74

as previously described

75

and docked to the experimental

structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain (RBD, PDBid: 6M17) 6.
Docking was performed using the RosettaDock 3.12 software

76

as previously described 77.

Briefly, each antibody was manually placed with the CDR loops facing the RBD region
containing the residues identified by the peptide mapping experiment. The two partners
were moved away from each other by 25Å and then brought together by the computational
docking algorithm, obtaining thousands of computationally generated complexes (typically
15,000). The antibody/RBD complexes were structurally clustered and then selected
according to the scoring function (an estimate of energetically favourable solutions) and
agreement with the peptide mapping data. Selected complexes were further optimized by
a docking refinement step and molecular dynamics simulations.
The MD simulations were performed using GROMACS

79

with standard MD protocol:

antibody/antigen complexes were centered in a triclinic box, 0.2 nm from the edge, filled
with SPCE water model and 0.15M Na+Cl- ions using the AMBER99SB-ILDN protein force
field; energy minimization followed. Temperature (298K) and pressure (1 Bar) equilibration
steps of 100ps each were performed. 500ns MD simulations was run with the abovementioned force field for each protein complexes. MD trajectory files were analyzed after
removal of Periodic Boundary Conditions. The overall stability of each simulated complex
was verified by root mean square deviation, radius of gyration and visual analysis
according to standard procedures.
