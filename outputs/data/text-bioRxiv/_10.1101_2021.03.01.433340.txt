Abstract

27

An in-depth analysis of first wave SARS-CoV-2 genome is required to identify various mutations

28

that significantly affect viral fitness. In the present study, we have performed comprehensive in-

29

silico mutational analysis of 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),

30

and spike (S) proteins with the aim of gaining important insights into first wave virus mutations

31

and their functional and structural impact on SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our integrated analysis

32

gathered 3465 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and identified 92 mutations in S, 37 in RdRp, and 11 in

33

3CLpro regions. The impact of those mutations was also investigated using various in silico

34

approaches. Among these 32 mutations in S, 15 in RdRp, and 3 in 3CLpro proteins are found to

35

be deleterious in nature and could alter the structural and functional behavior of the encoded

36

proteins. D614G mutation in spike and P323L in RdRp are the globally dominant variants with a

37

high frequency. Most of them have also been found in the binding moiety of the viral proteins

38

which determine their critical involvement in the host-pathogen interactions and drug targets. The

39

findings of the current study may facilitate better understanding of COVID-19 diagnostics,

40

vaccines, and therapeutics.

Introduction

45

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), among the seventh known

46

human infecting coronaviruses, is a highly transmissible and pathogenic virus [1]. It belongs to

47

the Betacoronavirus genus and is enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus [2].

48

Mutation is a distinct aspect of RNA viruses depending upon the fidelity of their RNA-dependent

49

RNA polymerase (RdRp) [3]. Mutation can have their advantages for viruses and can contribute

50

to viral adaptation towards pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistance [4]. Many

51

mutations cause drug resistance and affect the virulence of various pathogenic viruses. Hence,

52

they have a great impact on human health, speculating that any new mutations in SARS-CoV-2

53

can be hazardous during this rapidly escalating outbreak. Studies performed over the past few

54

months have revealed and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 have some evolving mutations in their

55

human host [5].

56

The functional and structural consequences of these mutations are unknown, and it will be

57

substantial to determine its impact on transmissibility and pathogenesis in humans. The analysis

58

of genetic sequence data freely available at NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) and

59

Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.epicov.org) sheds light on

60

key epidemiological parameters of SARS-CoV-2, including evolving mutations globally [6].

61

Therefore, we kept our focus on SARS-CoV-2 mutations lying within RdRp, 3C-like protease

62

(3CLpro), and spike proteins in an attempt to assess the spread of new viral variants across the

63

countries and also the real functional and structural impact of these mutations on the pathogenicity

64

of SARS-CoV-2. These viral proteins are considered among the primary targets for vaccine and

65

antiviral drug development.

66

A more comprehensive understanding of virulence mutations and their evolution can be achieved

67

by genomic analysis of sequence data that can further guide to various experimental studies. The

68

availability of such comprehensive data is enabling researchers to use various bioinformatics tools

69

in an attempt to extract useful hidden clinical and molecular information [7]. However, there is a

70

need to uncover deleterious mutations and their pathogenic variants from the readily available

71

data and to further explore their impact at the molecular level. In-silico tools can be effectively

72

utilized for prioritizing different variations in a cost-efficient manner and to further investigate

73

structural and functional consequences of specific mutations [8]. Thus, in this study all available

74

genomic information of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have been retrieved and various

75

in-silico approaches have been used to provide an insight into the pathogenic landscape of

76

various mutations on selected viral proteins.

77

The main aim of the study was to understand and predict various pathogenic variants in the first

78

wave of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), and spike (S) proteins. Overall, 32

79

mutations in S, 15 in RdRp, and 3 in 3CLpro have been predicted in this study, which are involved

80

in major phenotypic damage and could alter the structural and functional behavior of the encoded

81

proteins.

Material and Methods

1.

84

All complete genome sequences of the first wave SARS-CoV-2 (n=3465) were downloaded from

85

the GenBank and GISAID until 15thJuly, 2020. Genome sequence (NC_045512) was used as a

86

reference sequence and is considered as a wild type (WT) sequence. From these complete

87

genome sequences, sequences of S, RdRp and 3CLpro regions were screened out.

Protein sequences of S, RdRp and 3CLpro regions were first aligned with the reference sequence

90

(NC_045512) using CLC workbench 7 and Bioedit [9]. The origin and position of each mutation

within these viral proteins are assessed.

Prediction of different mutations that alters the structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins

97

functional features of COVID-19 viral proteins, following analyses were performed:

98

3.1. Predicting the functional impact of mutations

99

To characterize mutations as neutral or deleterious to the structure and function of the encoded

100

proteins, SIFT [10], PhD-SNP [11], and SNAP2 tools [12] were employed. SIFT predicts the

101

functional importance of an amino acid variations based on the conservation and alignment of

102

highly similar orthologoue and paralogoue protein sequences. Substitutions with probability score

103

less than 0.05 are considered to be deleterious, while values ≥0.05 are considered to be tolerated,

104

i.e. they may have no significant effect.

105

PhD-SNP is a support vector machine-based software and predict whether the substitution may

106

cause a disease or may remain neutral. The SNAP2 (screening for non-acceptable

107

polymorphisms) program (www.rostlab.org/services/SNAP/) makes predictions regarding the

108

functionality of variant proteins.

3.2.

Predicting protein stability changes upon mutations

110

Prediction of the mutations impact on the conformation, flexibility, and stability of protein is also

111

required to gain an insight into structure-function relationship of the encoded protein. Protein

112

stability is the basic characteristic that affects the function, activity, and regulation of proteins [13].

113

Free energy related to protein unfolding is a key index of protein stability. Therefore, by analyzing

114

the influence of mutation on free energy, its effect on protein stability could be accurately

115

determined. To quantitatively predict the change in protein conformation, flexibility, and stability

116

due to mutations, i-Mutant version 2.0 [11], DUET [14] and Dynamut [13] web servers were used.

117

For DUET and Dynamut prediction, 3D structure of RdRp and S were predicted using i-TASSER

118

while crystal structure (5re5) of 3CLpro was retrieved from protein data bank (PDB).

119

4.

120

In order to recapitulate the predictive results of above-mentioned tools, a scoring criterion was set

121

(0-6). If a mutation were predicted to be “harmless” or “neutral” by all tools, it would score 0.

122

Though, it would get a score if any of the tool predicted it as a “harmful” or “Pathogenic” mutation

123

respective of the number of tools predicting it. Mutations predicted by four or more tools (thus with

124

score ≥4) were then screened for further evaluations.

125

5.

126

Each deleterious mutation (score ≥4) was inserted in the PDB structure of each selected viral

127

protein by using chimera and Normal mode analysis was performed via iMod server (iMODS)

128

(http://imods.chaconlab.org) by using the basic default values for all the parameters mentioned.

130

To find the location of screened mutations within the drug binding sites of viral proteins, COACH

131

(http://zhanglab.umich.edu/COACH/) and CASTP (http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/index.html?2r7g)

132

servers were used. These servers predict protein-ligand binding sites and thus these sites were

133

evaluated for the presence of any pathogenic mutations. Mutations lying within these regions were

134

then screened out to have negative effect on the targeted proteins and their possible interactions.

135

Results

136

Mutations residing in S, RdRp, and 3CLpro sequences

137

Alignment of 3,465 SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences with the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1

138

(Accession NC_045512) revealed 92 mutations in S, 37 in RdRp, and 11 in 3CLpro regions (Table

139

1 and Figure 1). These mutations were found to be in a wide range of countries, including the

140

United States (US), China, Australia, South Korea, India, Peru, Sweden, Spain, Vietnam,

141

England, Pakistan, Turkey, Germany, France, Greece, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Colombia, Iran,

142

and Malaysia. It indicates that the virus has a significantly high evolution rate in various

143

geographical regions to increase the viral fitness. D614G (50%) and P323L (49%) mutations

144

showed the highest frequency among the screened sequences (n=3,465). Moreover, the mutation

145

frequencies of P323L (49%) and D614G (50%) was found to be similar within the period of 15

146

January 2020 to 15th July 2020.

147

To further evaluate the effect of the given mutations on the structure and function of respective

148

proteins, a variety of in-silico SNP prediction algorithms were used. NC_045512 was taken as a

149

wild type genome. Its S and RdRp structure were predicted by i-TASSER, whereas crystal

150

structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was retrieved from PDB (PDB ID: 5re5).

151

Analyzing the effect of mutations on structural and functional stability of the proteins

152

Six prediction software tools, including SIFT [10], PhDSNP [15], SNAP2 [12], I-Mutant version 2.0

153

[11], DUET [14], and Dynamut [13] were employed to predict the effects of total 140 mutations in

154

S (92), RdRp (37), and 3CLpro (11). According to SIFT analysis, in the S protein, 34 mutations

155

were found to be deleterious and 58 mutations tend to be tolerated (neutral) in nature. In the RdRp

156

protein, 20 mutations were declared in-tolerated, while 17 were tolerated. In the 3CLpro protein,

157

two mutations were predicted as in-tolerated and nine mutations were tolerated.

158

PhD-SNP predicted 20 mutations in S protein as damaging or deleterious, 11 in RdRp, and two

159

in 3CLpro protein. SNAP2 revealed that 29 mutations in S, 10 in RdRp, and three in 3CLpro could

160

affect the overall function of these viral proteins. It also predicts which type of amino acid that

161

affect the function of the protein when altered at a particular position. Based on its predicted

162

analysis, a heat map is also generated depicting the abilities of the amino acids to change the

163

function of respective viral proteins (Figure 2A).

164

Findings of i-Mutant showed that out of 92 mutations, 71 were deleterious for the S structure. It

165

also revealed that 32 mutations in RdRp and seven in 3CLpro are deleterious mutations.

166

According to DUET, 68 mutations in S, 23 mutations in RdRp, and eight mutations in 3CLpro

167

proteins are deleterious in nature. Findings of Dynamut suggest that 65 mutations in S, 25 in

168

RdRp, and eight in 3CLpro can affect the structural conformation of the respective viral proteins.

169

It also predicts interatomic interactions of wild-type and mutant amino acid with the environment

170

based on atom type, interatomic distance, and angle constraints. Some of the selected deleterious

171

mutations of S, RdRp, and 3CLpro as well as interatomic interaction analysis have been shown

172

in Figure 2B-2D.

173

Details of all predicted mutations and their possible effects on the encoded proteins have been

174

demonstrated in Table 1. These analyses predict mutations that could affect the structural stability

175

of protein by changing the flexibility and rigidity in the targeted proteins. To evaluate these

176

mutations, six tools have been employed, each tool has different strategies and parameters to

177

predict deleterious mutations. The mutations with more positive results were more likely to be truly

178

deleterious. Mutations observed to be deleterious by more than three prediction algorithms have

179

been classified as high-risk (see Material and Methods).

180

Figure 3 shows the prediction results of six computation tools. As a result, five mutations were

181

predicted to be neutral with a score of 0, while 19, 17, 49, 25, 12, and 13 mutations got a score of

182

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively (Figure 3). Based on the given criteria, 32 mutations in S, 15 in

183

RdRp, and three in 3CLpro (Table 1) met these criteria (score ≥ 4) and were chosen for further

184

analysis (Figure 3). Among these pathogenic mutations, D614G (score=4) in S region has already

185

been reported to be associated with a greater infectivity [16]. Another highly prevalent mutation

186

(P323L) in RdRp region was found to be neutral (score=2), whereas its infectivity has not been

187

reported so far. Finally, all these deleterious mutations were mapped on 3D structure of the viral

188

proteins. It was observed that all these mutations were uniformly distributed on the viral protein

189

structures.

190

Localization of the deleterious mutations within the binding sites of viral proteins

191

The 3D structure SARS-CoV-2 protease was retrieved from PDB with PDB ID 5RE5. For S and

192

RdRp proteins, top i-TASSER predicted models were selected on the basis of C-score.

193

RAMPAGE and ProSA web servers were further used to verify the reliability of predicted models.

194

The results of the predicted 3D RdRp model showed 83% of residues in favored region, 10.8% in

195

additional allowed region, and 6.2% in outlier region. Tertiary structure of S protein showed 75.2%

196

in favored region, 14.8% in allowed regions, and 10% in outlier regions that highly indicates a

197

good stereo-chemical quality of the predicted structures. By using these 3D structures, COACH

198

and CASTP servers predicted the possible ligand binding sites of these proteins. Ligand binding

199

sites predicted by both servers were considered as potential binding sites. It was observed that in

200

S protein, 22 out of 37 deleterious mutation positions including 28, 71, 74, 96, 152, 348, 435, 675,

201

682, 797, 824, 846, 860, 930, 936, 970, 1168, 1178, 1168, 1250, 1258, and 1259 were lying in

202

the ligand binding site. In RdRp, 13 predicted deleterious mutation positions (25, 44, 63, 110, 228,

203

249, 333, 426, 491, 660, 810, 824, and 916) were lying in the ligand binding sites. While in 3CLpro,

204

all selected deleterious mutation positions (15, 60, and 89) lie within the binding site.

205

Normal mode analysis of highly deleterious mutations

206

iMODs is a user-friendly interface for normal mode analysis methodology. It provides the detailed

207

information about mobility (B-factors), eigenvalues, covariance map, and deformability. The eigen

208

value represents the total mean square fluctuations and is related to the energy required to deform

209

the structure. The lower eigenvalues represent the easier deformation of the protein. iMODs

210

analysis revealed that all selected deleterious mutations decrease the eigen values of RdRp, S,

211

and 3CLpro proteins, indicating the deleterious effects of the evolving mutations in the selected

212

viral proteins (Figure S1).

213

Discussion

214

The current study is based on in-silico mutagenesis analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, S, and

215

3CLpro proteins to identify mutations and their possible structural and functional impact to the

216

encoded viral proteins. In this study, 92 mutations in S, 37 in RdRp, and 11 in 3CLpro proteins

217

have been identified in the available sequence data from all over the world. The effect of such

218

mutations on the structure and function of respective viral proteins is important to predict the

219

evolutionary potential of the viral proteins. However, in-silico prediction of the impact of amino

220

acid variants to the proteins’ structure and function may, sometimes, be considered as an

221

alternative or pre-study indicator to in vitro expression level studies [17]. In addition, interpretation

222

of the proteomic variants in the light of their phenotypic effects is one of the emerging crucial tasks

223

to solve in order to advance our understanding of how these variants affect SARS-CoV-2 proteins

224

structural and functional behavior. RdRp, S, and 3CLpro proteins of SARSCoV-2 are important

225

targets for antiviral drug and vaccine development [18] and thus, have been selected for

226

bioinformatics analysis in this study. Any mutation in these viral proteins could be either beneficial

227

or deleterious for the virus in this pandemic [3]. Therefore, we identified mutations in the selected

228

viral proteins as well as the possible impact of these mutations on the overall structure and

229

function of these proteins.

230

It was observed that most of the mutations were lying in the S region (92), followed by RdRp (37),

231

and 3CLpro (11). Highly mutated amino acid was observed at the position of D614G (50%) in S

232

protein and P323L (49%) in RdRp protein. By using various in silico algorithms and selecting

233

scoring criteria (0-6), it was estimated that 32 mutations in S, 15 in RdRp, and 3 in 3CLpro proteins

234

were deleterious in nature and probably affect the overall structure and function of these viral

235

proteins. Among these mutations, D614G is highly prevalent and associated with greater

236

infectivity of COVID-19 infection. It was also found to be pathogenic in nature (score=4), thus

237

validating the current results. Another highly prevalent mutation P323L in RdRp was found to be

238

neutral (score=2). Similarly, the remaining mutations are rare and does not appear to be more

239

deleterious.

240

Together, these findings have implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

241

These mutations do not only affect structural and functional abilities of viral proteins, but they

242

might also affect the binding affinities of these viral proteins with various drugs, as most of these

243

pathogenic mutations are also present in ligand binding regions. This characterization of drug and

vaccine target protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 could help us in understanding the pathogenesis,

246

to characterize the impact of these identified pathogenic mutations by employing various in vitro

and molecular approaches.
