ABSTRACT: The emergence and rapid proliferation of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in
a global pandemic, with over six million cases and nearly four hundred thousand deaths reported worldwide by the end of May 2020. A rush to find the cures prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing
therapeutics vis-à-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools
capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in
supporting the mechanistic studies of drug/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain
limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2
spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site
on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS.
However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the non-covalent complexes formed by ACE2 and
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular
modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin
oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association
alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD
surface), resulting in a notable decrease of its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of
heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between
the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study
demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means
of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in late 20191 resulted in a global pandemic
that had left virtually no country in the world unaffected.2 The new disease (termed COVID-19) claimed
over 400,000 lives worldwide by the end of May 2020, with the number of new cases still averaging over
100,000 in early June. This global healthcare crisis has resulted in a rush to find effective treatments for
COVID-19, with strategies relying on repurposing of the existing medicines given high priority.3 While the
initial efforts were largely empirical,4,5 the rapid progress in understanding the etiology of COVID-19 and
accumulation of the vast body of knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and its mechanism of infectivity provided an extensive list of therapeutic targets for rational intervention.6 One such high-value target
is the viral spike protein (S-protein),7 which is critical for both docking of the viral particle to its host cell
surface receptor ACE2,8 and the concomitant fusion with the cell membrane followed by the delivery of
the viral load.9
One particularly promising avenue for therapeutic intervention that currently enjoys considerable attention is blocking the ACE2/S-protein interaction site with either antibodies or small molecules.10 In particular, heparin interaction with the S-protein has been shown to induce conformational changes within the
latter11 and to have inhibitory effects on the cellular entry by the virus.12 Combined with the well-documented anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory13 properties of heparin (that are highly relevant vis-à-vis
the two hallmarks of COVID-19, the coagulopathy14,15 and the cytokine storm16), this led to a suggestion
that heparin or related compounds may play multiple roles in both arresting the SARS-CoV-2 infection
and mitigating its consequences.17,18 In fact, heparin treatment of COVID-19 patients has been adopted
by some physicians and is associated with a better prognosis.19 At the same time, the use of heparin
raises the specter of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and its incidents were found to be particularly high among critical COVID-19 patients.20 Clearly, utilization of heparin or related compounds as a
safe and efficient treatment of coronavirus-related pathologies will hinge upon the ability to select a subset of structures that exhibit the desired properties (e.g., the ability to block the ACE2/S-protein association) while lacking the deleterious effects (e.g., the ability to create immunogenic ultra-large complexes
with platelet factor 4, the hallmark of HIT,21 or cause excessive bleeding). Similar sentiments can be
expressed with respect to a wide range of other medicines that are currently a focus of extensive repurposing efforts.3 This work can be greatly facilitated by analytical methods capable of providing detailed
information on the drug candidates’ interactions with their therapeutic targets, and their ability to disrupt
the molecular processes that are critical for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Native mass spectrometry (MS)
has been steadily gaining popularity in the field of drug discovery,22,23 but its applications are frequently
limited to relatively homogeneous systems. Unfortunately, the large size and the extensive glycosylation
of the proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 docking to the host cell surface (fourteen N-glycans within
the ectodomain of ACE2 and at least eighteen O- and N-glycans within the S-protein ectodomain,24 including three in its receptor binding domain, RBD) make the straightforward application of native MS to

study ACE2/S-protein association challenging. This problem may be further exacerbated by the structural
heterogeneity of therapeutics that are evaluated as potential disruptors of the ACE2/S-protein association, such as heparin and its derivatives.
Several approaches have been developed in the past decade as a means of facilitating native MS
analyses of highly heterogeneous systems, which rely on supplementing MS measurements with nondenaturing front-end separation techniques,25 and gas-phase chemistry (e.g., limited charge reduction26).
The latter is particularly attractive, as it allows native MS to be applied to systems as heterogeneous as
associations of proteins with unfractionated heparin.27 In this work we use native MS in tandem with
limited charge reduction to characterize ACE2/RBD complexes and evaluate the influence of heparinrelated compounds (a synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux and a fixed-length eicosasaccharide heparin chains) on the stability of these complexes. Above and beyond providing important mechanistic details on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the potential of
native MS supplemented by limited charge reduction to support the COVID-19 related drug repurposing
efforts.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
The recombinant forms of human ACE2 (residues 1-740) and RBD (residues 319-541) were purchased
from Sino Biological (Wayne, PA). Both proteins were extensively dialyzed in 150 mM NH4CH3CO2 prior
to MS analyses. Fondaparinux was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and heparin eicosasaccharide produced by partial depolymerization of heparin was purchased from Iduron (Alderley Edge,
UK). All solvents and buffers used in this work were of analytical grade or higher.
Native MS measurements were carried out using a Synapt G2-Si (Waters, Milford, MA) hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source. The following ion source
parameters were used to maintain non-covalent complexes in the gas phase: sampling cone voltage, 80
V; trap CE, 4 V; trap DC bias, 3 V; and transfer CE, 0 V. Ion selection before limited charge reduction
was carried out by setting the quadrupole selection parameters (LM resolution) to 4.5. To trigger limited
charge reduction, the trap wave height was set at 0.3 V and the discharge current was optimized.
Molecular modeling of the RBD/heparin complexes was carried out using a Maestro (Schrödinger LLC,
New York, NY) modeling suite, release 2019-4. The model of RBD/ACE2 was prepared using the 2019nCoV RBD/ACE2-B0AT1 complex (PDB 6M17) as a template. The pentasaccharide model was extracted
from the crystal structure of the platelet factor 4/fondaparinux complex (PDB 4R9W) and dp20 model
was created by deleting a tetrasaccharide from the nonreducing end of heparin dp24 (PDB 3IRJ) with 3
sulfate groups cut-off. The heparinoid complexes were minimized using the OPLS3 force field. The MD
simulations were set up using a neutralized system (with 6 and 34 Na+ ions used for fonfdaparinux and
dp20, respectively) in explicit water and 150 mM NaCl at 300K under the OPLS3 force field.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Despite the modest size of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), its mass spectrum acquired under native conditions (Figure 1, bottom) is convoluted and difficult to interpret. Since the main
source of structural heterogeneity within this protein is its extensive glycosylation (Shajahan, et al. identified two N-glycosylation and at least one O-glycosylation sites within this segment of the S-protein24),
we also attempted to work with a commercial RBD expressed in E. coli, which presumably lacked glycan
chains. However, this construct had poor solubility characteristics and appeared to exist as a large aggregate (mostly likely due to the aberrant disulfide formation). Therefore, our efforts were focused on
using limited charge reduction to facilitate the native MS analysis of glycoproteins expressed in eukaryotic cells, which identified the major ionic species as the RBD monomer (average MW 32.7 kDa), and
the minor one as the dimer (65.5 kDa). The latter is likely to reflect the presence of an unpaired cysteine
residue within the RBD segment (see Supporting Information) capable of forming an external disulfide
bond.
Addition of a structurally homogeneous pentasaccharide heparin mimetic (fondaparinux) to the RBD
solution results in a noticeable shift of the ionic signal in native MS (Figure 1, middle). The magnitude of
this shift (1521 Da) correlates with the ligand mass (1505 Da); importantly, only 1:1 protein/ligand complexes are observed (in contrast to high-pI proteins, which act as heparin “sponges” by accommodating
multiple polyanionic chains28). Similar behavior was observed when a fixed-length heparin oligomer
(eicosasaccharide, or dp20) was added to the RBD solution. The magnitude of the shift (5.6 kDa) corresponded to a dp20 species carrying on average 26 sulfate groups (the sulfation levels in dp20 range
from 17 to 2829), and only 1:1 RBD/dp20 complexes were observed alongside the less abundant free
protein (see the inset in Figure 1).
The absence of the 1:2 protein/heparin oligomer complexes might seem surprising, as the protein surface contains two distinct basic patches (R346, R355, K356 and R357) and (R454, R457, K458, K462
and R466) that were previously suggested to be heparin binding sites.11 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the RBD/fondaparinux complex indicates that the polyanion association with the protein results in significant conformational changes on the surface of the latter, giving rise to a consolidated patch
of the positive charge (Figure 2). While such conformational rearrangement provides enthalpic gains for
the electrostatically driven RBD/heparin oligomer interaction, it exerts deleterious effects on the
RBD/ACE2 binding. Indeed, conformation of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of RBD following RBD
association with fondaparinux undergoes significant changes, which affect critical residues in the
RBD/ACE2 interface7 (see Supporting Information for more detail).
To confirm the ability of a short heparin oligomer to disrupt the RBD/ACE2 association, native mass
spectra of the two proteins’ mixture were acquired in the absence and in the presence of fondaparinux.
The reference RBD/ACE2 spectrum (Figure 3, bottom) features an abundant signal of the (RBD·ACE2)2
complex alongside the residual (unbound) RBD that was present in molar excess in solution. No signal

of unbound ACE2 could be detected, consistent with the reported binding strength in the low-nM range.7
The mass spectrum appearance changes in the presence of fondaparinux (5-fold molar excess over
RBD), with the ionic signal of ACE2 monomers becoming prominent in the m/z region 5,000-6,000 (Figure
3, middle trace). The presence of both free RBD and ACE2 species suggests a dramatic decrease of the
affinity (to the μM level). The destabilizing effect is even more significant in the presence of the longer
heparinoid. The presence of dp20 in solution resulted in the ionic signals of free RBD and ACE2 monomer
becoming equiabundant with that of their 2:2 complex; the spectrum also reveals the presence of an
unsaturated (2:1) ACE2/RBD complex (Figure 3, top).
The importance of the heparin oligomer chain length in modulating its ability to disrupt the RBD/ACE2
interaction is likely to be related to the limited physical size of the positive patch on the RBD surface that
cannot accommodate more than six saccharide units (Figure 2). The rest of the polyanionic chain is
exposed to the solvent, resulting in unfavorable interactions with the low-pI ACE2 molecules (due to the
electrostatic repulsion). This results in a synergistic effect, with the longer heparin chain destabilizing the
RBD/ACE2 association via both conformational rearrangements within the former (vide supra) and the
long-range electrostatic repulsion of the latter. In contrast, the shorter oligomer (fondaparinux) disrupts
the RBD/ACE2 interaction only via allosteric conformational changes within the RBM segment, exerting
a somewhat weaker destabilizing effect. Taken together, the results of native MS measurements and MD
simulations provide important insights into the mechanism of the RBD/ACE2 association disruption by
heparin that will be invaluable for rational selection of the most potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2
docking to the host cell.
CONCLUSIONS
The level of structural heterogeneity displayed by both viral proteins and their counterparts on the surface of the host cells (as well as some of the proposed therapeutics, such as heparin) may seem overwhelming for the straightforward “intact-molecule” MS measurements. However, incorporation of the limited charge reduction in the experimental workflow allows meaningful information to be obtained on objects as complex as 2:2 RBD/ACE2 associations. While native MS cannot provide the level of structural
detail produced in crystallographic studies,30,31 it allows the influence of various compounds on the stability of such complexes to be readily evaluated and mechanistic details to be revealed, thereby enabling
rational approach to the drug repurposing efforts. Design of successful therapeutic strategies against a
foe as formidable as SARS-CoV-2 will require mobilization of efforts and resources in the entire field of
life sciences, and the analytical tools (including MS) will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in these efforts.

Ion source parameters used in MS measurements
The following ion source parameters were used to maintain non-covalent complexes in the gas phase:
sampling cone voltage, 80 V; trap CE, 4 V; trap DC bias, 3 V; and transfer CE, 0 V. Ion selection before
limited charge reduction was carried out by setting quadrupole selection parameters: LM resolution, 4.5.
To trigger limited charge reduction, the trap wave height was set as 0.3 V and the discharge current was
optimized.

ACE2 amino acid sequence
The sequence is based on the UniProt entry Q9BYF1. The black vertical arrows indicate the termini of
the construct used in this work (not inclusive of the C-terminal His-tag). The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD
contact sites are highlighted in blue. The presumed N-glycosylation sites are underlined, and the disulfide
bonds are indicated with brackets. The gray-shaded region (not included in the construct) is the transmembrane part of ACE2.

RBD amino acid sequence
The RBD sequence (underlined with blue lines) is shown in the context of UniProt entry P0DTC2 representing the entire ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (the gray-shaded region corresponds to the
S1 domain). The amino acid residues forming distinct positive patches on the RBD surface are colored
in blue. The presumed N-glycosylation sites are underlined, and the N- and O-glycosylation sites reported
by Shajahan, et al. (Deducing the N- and O- glycosylation profile of the spike protein of novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2. Glycobiology 2020, in press) are indicated with the blue and yellow boxes, respectively
(the blue crosses indicate the presumed glycosylation sites that were reported to be glycan-free by Shajahan, et al.). The disulfide bonds are indicated with black brackets. The red-shaded regions indicate the
protease cleavage sites. The fusion peptide and the heptad repeats are underlined with green and brown
lines, respectively.

Native MS of ACE2
Black trace: a mass spectrum of an aqueous solution of ACE2 ectodomain (5 μM in 150 mM NH4CH3CO2,
pH 6.9). Green, orange and red traces: signal generated by limited charge reduction of ionic populations
selected at m/z 5,161 u, 6,600 u and 6,855 u, respectively (the masses deduced from these charge
ladders are 92,954 Da and 185,264 Da, representing the monomeric and dimeric states of ACE2 ectodomain)

Details of MD studies of the heparin oligomers interactions with RBD
The model of RBD/ACE2 was prepared using the 2019-nCoV RBD/ACE2-B0AT1 complex (PDB 6M17)
as a template. The pentasaccharide model was extracted from platelet factor 4/fondaparinux (PDB
4R9W) and dp20 model was created by deleting a tetrasaccharide from the nonreducing end of heparin
dp24 (3IRJ) with 3 sulfate groups cut-off. The heparinoid complexes were minimized using the OPLS3
force field. The MD simulations were set up using a neutralized system (with 6 and 34 Na+ ions used for
fonfdaparinux and dp20, respectively) in explicit water and 150 mM NaCl at 300K under OPLS3 force
field.

Influence of fondaparinux binding to RBD on the conformation of the ACE2-binding interface. The ribbon
diagrams show backbones of RBD bound to ACE2 (green) and associated with fondaparinux following
1.5 ns MD simulation (teal). Side chains of all contact residues are shown in stick representation; the five
critical residues are colored in each structure (red and purple, respectively).
