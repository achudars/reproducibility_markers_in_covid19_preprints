A BSTRACT
COVID-19 has disrupted researchers’ work and posed challenges to their life routines. We have
surveyed 740 researchers of which 66% experienced a decrease in productivity, 50% indicated
increased workload, and 66% reported they have been feeling internal pressure to make progress.
Those whose research required physical presence in a lab or the field experienced considerable
disruption and productivity decrease. About 82% of this group will try to permanently reduce their
work dependency on physical presence. Parents and those taking care of vulnerable dependents have
been spending less time on research due to their role conflict. We further observed a gender gap in
the overall disruption consequences; more female researchers have been experiencing a reduction in
productivity and external pressure to make progress. The results of this study can help institution
leaders and policymakers better understand the pandemic’s challenges for the research community
and motivate appropriate measures to instill long-term solutions.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the life and work of researchers on an unprecedented global scale. Early studies
have shed light on the magnitude of the pandemic’s disruption on scientific progress by investigating the change of
allocations of work time[1] and the means and effectiveness of communication during the remote working environment
of researchers[2].
During this pandemic, researchers have developed new life and work routines based on constantly changing circumstances such as access to work-space, teaching duties, and parenting responsibilities, to name a few. Despite recent
major progress in vaccine development and deployment, long-term fundamental shifts in the life and work routine of
researchers such as the utilization of online platforms and reducing non-essential travels are already being predicted[3, 4].
Nevertheless, there has been a lack of research evidence collected regarding the evolving work-life balance routines of
researchers in the past months.
This knowledge is crucial to policymakers as well as the research community to adjust current guidelines. We hope that
by following the constructed guidelines, the scientific community can mitigate the long term negative effects and devise
appropriate preventive measures for future global-scale crises.
We have conducted a survey to better understand the current life and work routine of researchers, as well as the long
term effect of the pandemic on research. Within a 10 day period starting on December 1, 2020, 740 responses were
collected from active researchers across North America and Europe.

All researches were disrupted
Overall, 71% of participants’ institutions experienced a full closure- no physical access- for at least one month for
non-essential personnel. Only 3.5% of participants had full access to their work space at all times, while the rest had
partial access. At the time of data collection, the portion of researchers with no-access reduced to 16%, and the partial
access was increased to 51%, Figure 1. A central stratifying measure in our study was whether physical presence in
a lab or in the field is needed for the researcher to conduct their work. About 36% of participants indicated that the
general state of their research requires physical presence in a lab or in the field, while the rest indicated having access to
internet and computational resources are sufficient to conduct their research work. For the rest of this paper, the former
group is going to be addressed as the Physical Presence Group (PPG) and the latter as the No Physical Presence Group
(NPPG). Within the PPG, 94% indicated either minor or major disruption in their work by the closure period. Only
66% of NPPG’s population experienced such interruption, which is still noticeable for a group whose research nature
does not require physical presence. The main factor for interruptions for NPPG, we reported to be lack of access to
resources (computational, library, software, etc.).
During the reopening stage, institutions have been prioritizing individuals and groups whose work have been impacted
the most. These groups consist of experimental workers with perishable samples, time-sensitive data measurements,
funding deadlines, etc. Our data reveals that a high degree of progress even for the NPPG depends on their PPG
collaborators. Hence, institutions should consider the interconnections and dependencies among various projects and
research groups in the next stages of reopening.

Reduced Productivity: A general trend
The effect of local or global shocks and uncertainties on individual and societal level productivity has been studied in
many contexts including wars, financial crisis, and natural disasters[5, 6]. The reallocation of resources from low to
high productivity units at the times of uncertainty affects the productivity growth on large scales.[7] On an individual
level, the shift of priorities and responsibilities can affect productivity. In our study, a general trend across all responses,
when asked about the change of productivity was a significant reduction in productivity. About 66% of all participants
reported a drop in productivity. With a higher overall average, 76% of the PPG experienced a drop while 60% of the
NPPG believed that their productivity was reduced, Figure 2. The 16% difference between the two groups in lowered
productivity may be associated with a smoother transition for the NPPG to a remote workplace. Also, across all groups,
trouble adapting to the new lifestyle was the main source of productivity reduction, reported by 74% of respondents.
Second to lifestyle adaptations, lack of motivation (with 51%) was another major contributor to decreased productivity.
While the majority of our data show a reduction in productivity, 12% of the PPG and 16% of the NPPG experienced
productivity increase. Within the NPPG and PPG with increased productivity, 56% and 39% of participants indicated
not commuting to be the main reason for a higher productivity, respectively. In addition, for both groups, being more
comfortable to work from home with 48% and 58% was the other notable reason for increased productivity, respectively.

Some of the practices that researchers got used to them during the pandemic can be continued even after the full return.
For example, utilizing online platforms for holding meetings and events open up new opportunities, such as reaching to
a broader audience[8].

Female researchers were impacted more by non-work related responsibilities and external
pressures
While the gender responsibility gap has become narrower over the past decades, recent studies showed that mothers
compared to fathers spend 10 more hours per week on housework and childcare[9]. In addition to this workload, Offer
and Schneider discuss that multitasking at work is associated with negative emotions and stress associated with feeling
guilty about spending less time with family. Yavorsky et al. show that pre-birth data suggests an egalitarian division of
housework, while post-birth, women spent significantly more time on childcare, housework, and total work[10].
A reasonable prediction is that the pandemic-driven closure of schools will put more burden on female researchers with
parenting responsibilities[11]. Some parameters that could help us measure the hypothesis are productivity decrease,
workload increase, and publication decrease. With the exception of reduced publications, which might surface only in
the longer term due to the time frame of a publication process, the productivity and the workload can be measured.
Evaluating the effect of demographic factors, female-identified participants reported a 74% productivity reduction while
those identified as male experienced a 61% reduction. Analyzing the decreased productivity reasons, the gap among
genders can be partially due to the higher number of females who were engaged in taking care of a child or a vulnerable
person. Within female researchers, 27% have indicated that a combination of care-taking responsibilities has lowered
their productivity, while 21% of male researchers were affected by these duties. Also, regardless of the productivity
change, when asked about their new work-life routine, 26% of females indicated devoting more time to "taking care of
my vulnerable dependant(s) (kids, parents, etc.)" in comparison to 16% of males.

We next studied the amount of internal and external pressures each group felt for progression in their work. For both
females and males, the internal pressure to progress was 69% and 63%, respectively. This gap increases in the amount
of external pressure each group felt. Approximately, 59% of female researchers indicated feeling external pressure to
progress while 40% of males felt such a pressure, Figure 2.
Pandemic shed light on preexisting financial and mental challenges of simultaneously being a parent and a researcher.
These challenges also reflected in career trajectory of female scientists seeking tenure track positions[12]. While such
challenges are still widely unexplored, it is clear that the research community, especially graduate students, suffer
from the lack of supportive policies regarding affordable childcare programs.[13, 14] Also, this pandemic showed how
unreliable common care-taking practices, such as relying on family members’ help, might be in uncertain times. A
university-wide subsidized childcare program is an absolute necessity for encouraging more female students to pursue
academic careers.

A scientific pause can bring new insights
Due to limited physical access to the workplace, the process of data collection was interrupted and many researchers
have been revisiting previously gathered data. Hence, we asked whether and how the reexamination of old data changed
previously drawn conclusions. About 52% of the researchers who needed physical presence in the lab or a field
indicated revisiting old data. Among this group, 52% mentioned that the reexamination of the previously gathered data
led to a new idea, insight, or conclusion. About 97% found the new idea, insight, or conclusion to be supporting or
complimentary compared to the previous ones. Only one participant found the new conclusion to contradict previous
ones.

Faculties experienced a higher workload increase
While new online platforms were created and the existing ones have increased their features to facilitate a smooth
transition from in person activities to remote, not all groups benefited equitably. Among graduate students and postdocs,
28% and 27% of them indicated that their workload have increased, respectively. However, 60% of faculties and
research staff with teaching and administrative responsibilities reported increased in workload. Among the faculties
with increased workload, 21% have been spending more time on professional services and reviewing publications. Also,
26% have been devoting more time to take care of my vulnerable dependant(s) (kids, parents, etc.). Such difference is a
direct result of life-stage differences of faculty members and graduate student and postdocs.

The pandemic will increase the demand of remote jobs
The study showed that the restrictions on physical travel and commuting to labs or the field have unequally affected
researchers whose work depend on their physical presence. When the PPG were asked if upon returning to the lab/field,
they would consider reducing the dependency of their work on physical presence, only 19% said that they will not.
About 33% indicated that they will and can reduce their work dependency on physical presence, and the remaining said
that they want to but cannot. This is an important result that demonstrates how the consequences of this pandemic have
changed long term perspectives of researchers about the nature of their work and lifestyle. Finally, when asked about

the researchers’ comfort regarding going back to the workplace with current precautionary measures, 63% said yes to
their readiness of going back while the remaining 37% said no. Examining researchers’ level of comfort for going back
to their workplace sheds light on the importance of the recent progresses on developing the vaccine and its central role
to the continuation of research projects.

Conclusion
The pandemic-driven closure of work spaces and schools impacted researchers on an unprecedented level. The majority
of researchers we surveyed reported that they are trapped in the vicious cycle of reduced productivity, increased
workload, and pressure felt to progress. To ensure a sustainable return to the pre-pandemic progress level, we believe
that research institutes and policymakers should take many contributing factors such as the mental health of the
employees and gender gap into account in addition to considerations on physical health.
