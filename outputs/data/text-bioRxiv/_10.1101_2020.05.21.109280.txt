Abstract

2

Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive

3

annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have

4

been associated with pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify and

5

characterize ORF3d, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-

6

CoVs but not other closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document evidence

7

of ORF3d translation, characterize its protein sequence, and conduct an evolutionary

8

analysis at three levels: between taxa (21 members of Severe acute respiratory syndrome-

9

related coronavirus), between human hosts (3978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and

10

within human hosts (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). ORF3d has been

11

independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19

12

patients. However, it has been misclassified as the unrelated gene ORF3b, leading to

13

confusion. Our results liken ORF3d to other accessory genes in emerging viruses and

14

highlight the importance of OLGs.

Introduction

2

The COVID-19 pandemic raises urgent questions about the properties that allow animal

3

viruses to cross species boundaries and spread within humans. Addressing these questions

4

requires an accurate and comprehensive understanding of viral genomes. One frequently

5

overlooked source of novelty is the evolution of new overlapping genes (OLGs), wherein a

6

single stretch of nucleotides encodes two distinct proteins in different reading frames. Such

7

“genes within genes” compress genomic information and allow genetic innovation via

8

overprinting (Keese and Gibbs 1992), particularly as frameshifted sequences preserve

9

certain physicochemical properties of proteins (Bartonek et al. 2020). However, OLGs also

10

entail the cost that a single mutation may alter two proteins, constraining evolution of the

11

pre-existing open reading frame (ORF) and complicating sequence analysis. Unfortunately,

12

genome annotation methods typically miss OLGs, instead favoring one ORF per genomic

13

region (Warren et al. 2010).

14

OLGs are known entities but remain inconsistently reported in viruses of the species

15

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus; genus

16

Betacoronavirus; Gorbalenya et al. 2020). For example, annotations of ORF3b, ORF9b, and

17

ORF9c are absent or conflicting in SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI:

18

NC_045512.2) and genomic studies (e.g., Chan et al. 2020; F. Wu et al. 2020), and OLGs

19

are often not displayed in genome browsers (e.g., Flynn et al. 2020). Further, ORF3b within

20

ORF3a, an extensively characterized OLG present in other species members including

21

SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1) (McBride and Fielding 2012), has sometimes been annotated in

22

SARS-CoV-2 even though it contains four early STOP codons in this virus. Such

23

inconsistencies complicate research, because OLGs may play key roles in the emergence of

24

new viruses. For example, in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), the novel OLG asp

25

within env is actively expressed in human cells (Affram et al. 2019) and is associated with

26

the pandemic M group lineage (Cassan et al. 2016).

Novel overlapping gene candidates

2

To identify novel OLGs within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we first generated a list of

3

candidate overlapping ORFs in the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NCBI: NC_045512.2).

4

Specifically, we used the codon permutation method of Schlub et al. (2018) to detect

5

unexpectedly long ORFs while controlling for codon usage. One unannotated gene

6

candidate, here named ORF3d, scored highly (p=0.0104), exceeding the significance of two

7

known OLGs annotated in Uniprot (ORF9b and ORF9c/ORF14 within N;

8

https://viralzone.expasy.org/8996) (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and

9

Supplementary Table 1).

10

ORF3d comprises 58 codons (including STOP) near the beginning of ORF3a (Table

11

1), making it longer than the known genes ORF7b (44 codons) and ORF10 (39 codons)

12

(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). ORF3d was discovered independently by Chan et. al

13

(2020) as ‘ORF3b’ and Pavesi (2020) as, simply, ‘hypothetical protein’. Due to this naming

14

ambiguity and its location within ORF3a, ORF3d has subsequently been conflated with the

15

previously documented ORF3b in multiple studies (Fung et al. 2020; Ge et al. 2020; Gordon

16

et al. 2020; Hachim et al. 2020; Helmy et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). Critically, ORF3d is

17

unrelated (i.e., not homologous) to ORF3b, as the two genes occupy different genomic

18

positions within ORF3a: ORF3d ends 39 codons upstream of the genome region

19

homologous to ORF3b, and the ORF3b start site corresponds to an ORF encoding only 23

20

codons in SARS-CoV-2 (A. Wu et al. 2020) (Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement

21

1, and Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, the two genes occupy different reading

22

frames: codon position 1 of ORF3a overlaps codon position 2 of ORF3d (frame ss12) but

23

codon position 3 of ORF3b (frame ss13). ORF3d is also distinct from other OLGs

24

hypothesized within ORF3a (Table 1). Thus, ORF3d putatively encodes a novel protein not

25

present in other Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus genomes, while the

26

absence of full-length ORF3b in SARS-CoV-2 distinguishes it from SARS-CoV (Figure 1).

27

Because ORF3b plays a central role in SARS-CoV immune interactions, its absence or

truncation in SARS-CoV-2 may be immunologically important (Konno et al. 2020; Yuen et al.

2020).

ORF3d molecular biology and expression

5

To assess the expression of ORF3d, we re-analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 ribosome profiling

6

(Ribo-seq) data of Finkel et al. (2020). This approach allows the study of gene expression

7

and reading frame at single nucleotide (nt) resolution by sequencing mRNA fragments

8

bound by actively translating ribosomes (ribosome footprints) (Ingolia et al. 2009). Focusing

9

on samples with reads reliably associated with ribosomes stalled at translation start sites

10

(i.e., lactimidomycin and harringtonine treatments at 5 hours post-infection) and trimming

11

reads to their 5′ ends (first nt), we observe a consistent peak in read depth ~12 nt upstream

12

of the start site of ORF3d (Figure 2A), the expected ribosomal P-site offset (Calviello and

13

Ohler 2017). Similar peaks are also observed for previously annotated genes (Figure 2A,

14

Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

15

To investigate the relationship between ribosome profiling read depth and expressed

16

protein levels, we next re-analyzed five publicly available SARS-CoV-2 mass spectrometry

17

(MS) datasets (Bezstarosti et al. 2020; Bojkova et al. 2020; Davidson et al. 2020; PRIDE

18

Project PXD018581; Zecha et al. 2020; Methods). We were unable to detect ORF3c,

19

ORF3d, ORF3b, ORF9c, or ORF10 when employing a 1% false-discovery threshold. This

20

result may reflect the limitations of MS for detecting proteins that are very short, weakly

21

expressed under the specific conditions tested, or lack detectable peptides. Even the

22

envelope protein E is not detected in some SARS-CoV-2 studies (Bojkova et al. 2020;

23

Davidson et al. 2020), and the only evidence for ORF3b expression in SARS-CoV comes

24

from Vero E6 cells (McBride and Fielding 2012). However, we do find a strong correlation

25

between protein expression as estimated from MS and the ribosome profiling read depth

26

observed at upstream peaks, with rS=0.89 (p=0.0004, Spearman’s rank) (Figure 2, Figure

27

2—figure supplement 2). This suggests that the presence and depth of an upstream peak is

28

a reliable indicator of expression. Specifically, results from both proteomic and ribosome

profiling approaches confirm that N, M, and S are the most highly expressed proteins, with N

2

constituting ~80% of the total viral protein content. We also observe that the number of

3

reads determined to be in the correct reading frame (codon position 1) along the gene is

4

moderately correlated with the MS expression values (rS=0.60, p=0.056), while this is not

5

true for out-of-frame (codon position 2 and 3) reads (rS=0.39, p=0.237) (Figure 2B, Figure

6

2—figure supplement 2).

Ribosome profiling reads have a strong tendency to map with their first nucleotide

7
8

occupying a particular codon position (i.e., in-frame) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).

9

We therefore examined codon position mapping across ORF3a to explore whether the

10

proportions of reads in alternative frames are higher in the ORF3c/ORF3d region.

11

Analyses were limited to reads of length 30 nt, the expected size of ribosome-bound

12

fragments, which exhibit positioning indicative of the correct reading frame (codon position 1)

13

of annotated genes and the highest total coverage (Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure

14

2—figure supplement 4). Sliding windows reveal a peak in the fraction of reads mapping to

15

the reading frame of ORF3d at its hypothesized locus, with this frame’s maximum occurring

16

at the center of ORF3d, co-located with a dip in the fraction of reads mapping to the frame of

17

ORF3a (Figure 2C). These observations are reproducible across treatments (Figure 2—

18

figure supplement 5), robust to sliding window size (Figure 2—figure supplement 6), and

19

similar to the reading frame perturbations observed for the OLG ORF9b within N (Figure 2—

20

figure supplement 7). At the same time, the ORF3d peak stands in contrast to the remainder

21

of ORF3a, where the reading frame of ORF3a predominates, and smaller peaks in the frame

22

of ORF3d are not accompanied by a large dip in the frame of ORF3a (Figure 2—figure

23

supplement 8). These observations suggest that ORF3d is actively translated. Similar

24

conclusions can be drawn for ORF3c, ORF3d-2, and ORF9b (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure

25

supplement 7, Figure 2—figure supplement 9).

26
27

Additional experiments have also provided evidence of ORF3d translation. Gordon et
al. (2020) used overexpression experiments to demonstrate that ORF3d (referred to as

‘ORF3b’; Table 1) can be stably expressed and that it interacts with the mitochondrial protein

2

STOML2. Most compellingly, ORF3d, ORF8, and N elicit the strongest antibody responses

3

observed in COVID-19 patient sera, with ORF3d sufficient to accurately diagnose the

4

majority of COVID-19 cases (Hachim et al. 2020). Because ORF3d is restricted to SARS-

5

CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV (see below), this finding is unlikely to be due to cross-reactivity

6

with another coronavirus, and provides strong independent evidence of ORF3d expression

7

during infection.

8

Protein sequence properties

9

To further investigate the antigenic properties of ORF3d, we predicted linear T-cell epitopes

10

for each SARS-CoV-2 protein. We employed NetMHCpan (Jurtz et al. 2017) for MHC class I

11

(cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells), an approach shown to accurately predict SARS-CoV-2 epitopes

12

shared with SARS-CoV (Grifoni et al. 2020), and NetMHCIIpan (Reynission et al. 2020) for

13

MHC class II (helper CD4+ T-cells). Specifically, we tested all 9 amino acid (MHC I) or 15

14

amino acid (MHC II) substrings of each viral protein for predicted weak or strong binding by

15

MHC. Epitope density was estimated as the mean number of predicted epitopes per residue

16

for each protein. We also tested two sets of negative controls: (1) randomized peptides

17

generated from each protein, representing the result expected given amino acid content

18

alone; and (2) short unannotated ORFs present in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, representing

19

the result expected for real ORFs that have been evolving without functional constraint.

20

For CD8+ T cells, the lowest predicted epitope density occurs in ORF3d (1.5 per

21

residue), which is unexpected given its own amino acid content (p=0.150) and compared to

22

short unannotated ORFs (p=0.078; permutation tests). The next lowest densities occur in N

23

and ORF8 (Figure 3A). Intriguingly, as previously mentioned, these three peptides (ORF3d,

24

N, and ORF8) also elicit the strongest antibody (B-cell epitope) responses measured in

25

COVID-19 patient sera (Hachim et al. 2020), suggesting a possible balance between CD8+

26

T and B cell epitopes. For CD4+ T cells, again, ORF3d has one of the lowest predicted

27

epitope densities (5.6 per residue; p≥0.291), with lower values seen in only three other

1

genes. However, focusing instead on the shorter ORF3d-2 isoform, this protein contains

2

zero predicted epitopes, which is a highly significant depletion given its own amino acid

3

content (p=0.001) and compared to short unannotated ORFs (p=0.001). These observations

4

suggest either a predisposition towards immune escape, allowing gene survival, or the

5

action of selective pressures on ORF3d or ORF3d-2 to remove epitopes. In stark contrast to

6

ORF3d, ORF3c has the highest observed density (8.4 per residue), apparently as a function

7

of its highly constrained amino acid content (p=0.996) (see below). The enrichment of

8

predicted epitopes in unannotated proteins (e.g., ORF3c and randomized peptides) but not

9

N, for which numerous epitopes are annotated at the Immune Epitope Database (Grifoni et

10

al. 2020), demonstrates that ascertainment or methodological biases cannot account for the

11

depletion of predicted epitopes in ORF3d.

12

Our structural prediction for the ORF3d protein suggests α-helices connected with

13

coils and an overall fold model that matches known protein structures (e.g., Protein Data

14

Bank IDs 2WB7 and 6A93) with borderline confidence (Figure 3—figure supplement 1),

15

similar to the predictions of Chan et al. (2020). Remarkably, biochemical properties that

16

influence the structure of this novel protein appear to be inherited from the pre-existing

17

ORF3a protein sequence encoded by the overlapping alternate reading frame. It has

18

recently been shown that frame-shifted nucleotide sequences tend to encode proteins with

19

similar hydrophobicity profiles as a consequence of the standard genetic code (Bartonek et

20

al., 2020). To explore whether this is the case for ORF3d, we used the VOLPES server

21

(Bartonek and Zagrovic 2019) to calculate the hydrophobicity profiles (Atchley et al. 2005) of

22

the peptides encoded by all three frames of ORF3a. The maximum correlation observed

23

occurs between the frames of ORF3a (ss11) and ORF3d (ss12) in the region encoding

24

ORF3d (ORF3a residues 64-102), with rS=0.87 (p=5.79×10-13, Spearman’s rank), much

25

stronger than the correlation between these frames observed for the non-OLG residues of

26

ORF3a (rS=0.27, p=8.70×10-4) (Figure 3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This

27

conservation of a structure-related property with the ORF3a protein provides further

28

evidence for ORF3d functionality, and may predispose this region towards de novo gene

birth. Again, ORF3c shows the opposite pattern, as the minimum correlation observed

2

between hydrophobicity profiles occurs between the frames of ORF3a (ss11) and ORF3c

3

(ss13) in the region encoding ORF3c (ORF3a residues 22-43), with rS=-0.40 (p=6.16×10-2).

4

Such disparate hydrophobicity profiles may be due to the strong conservation of ORF3c (see

5

below).

6

ORF3d taxonomic distribution and origins

7

To assess the origin of ORF3d and its conservation within and among host taxa, we aligned

8

21 Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus genomes reported by Lam et al.

9

(2020) (Supplementary Table 5), limiting our analysis to those with an annotated ORF1ab

10

and no frameshift variants relative to SARS-CoV-2 in the core genes ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, E,

11

M, ORF7a, ORF7b, and N (Supplementary Table 6; SARS-related-CoV_ALN.fasta,

12

supplementary data). All other genes are also intact (i.e., there is no mid-sequence STOP

13

codon) in all genomes (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8), with the exception of ORF3d,

14

ORF3b, and ORF8 (Figure 4). Specifically, ORF3d is intact in only 2 sequences: SARS-CoV-

15

2 Wuhan-Hu-1 and pangolin-CoVs from Guangxi (GX/P5L). Full-length ORF3b is intact in

16

only 3 sequences: SARS-CoV TW11, SARS-CoV Tor2, and bat-CoV Rs7327, with the

17

remainder falling into two distinct groups sharing an early or late STOP codon, respectively

18

(Supplementary Table 9). Finally, ORF8 is intact in all but 5 sequences, where it contains

19

premature STOP codons or large-scale deletions (Figure 1B).

20

The presence of intact ORF3d homologs among viruses infecting different host

21

species (human and pangolin) raises the possibility of functional conservation. However, the

22

taxonomic distribution of this ORF is incongruent with whole-genome phylogenies in that

23

ORF3d is intact in the pangolin-CoV more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 (GX/P5L) but not

24

the more closely related one (GD/1) (Figure 4), a finding confirmed by the alignment of Boni

25

et al. (2020). New sequence data reveal similarly puzzling trends: ORF3d contains STOP

26

codons in the closely related bat-CoV RmYN02 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_412977; data not shown),

27

but it is intact in three more distantly related bat-CoVs discovered in Rwanda and Uganda,

where it is further extended by 20 codons (total 78 codons) but shows no evidence of

2

conservation with SARS-CoV-2 (Wells et al. 2020 and pers. comm; data not shown).

3

Further, phylogenies of the 21 Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus

4

genomes built on ORF3a are incongruent with whole-genome phylogenies, likely due to the

5

presence of recombination breakpoints in ORF3a near ORF3d (Boni et al. 2020; Rehman et

6

al. 2020). Recombination, convergence, and recurrent loss may therefore each have played

7

a role in the origin and taxonomic distribution of ORF3d.

8

9

Between-taxa divergence

10

To examine natural selection on ORF3d, we measured viral diversity at three hierarchical

11

evolutionary levels: between-taxa, between-host, and within-host. Specifically, between-taxa

12

refers to divergence (d) among the 21 aforementioned viruses infecting bat, human, or

13

pangolin (Figure 1B); between-host refers to diversity (π) between consensus-level SARS-

14

CoV-2 genomes infecting different human individuals; and within-host refers to π in deeply

15

sequenced ‘intrahost’ SARS-CoV-2 samples from single human individuals. At each level,

16

we inferred selection by estimating mean pairwise nonsynonymous (dN or πN; amino acid

17

changing) and synonymous (dS or πS; not amino acid changing) distances among all

18

sequences. Importantly, we combined standard (non-OLG) methods (Nei and Gojobori 1986;

19

Nelson et al. 2015) with OLGenie, a new dN/dS method tailored for OLGs (hereafter OLG

20

dN/dS), which we previously used to verify purifying selection on a novel OLG in HIV-1

21

(Nelson et al. 2020).

22

The only gene to show significant evidence of purifying selection at all three

23

evolutionary levels is N (nucleocapsid-encoding gene) (Figure 5), which undergoes

24

disproportionately low rates of nonsynonymous change (dN/dS<1 and πN/πS<1) specifically in

25

its non-OLG regions, evidencing strict functional constraint. N is also the most highly

26

expressed gene (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), confirming that selection has more

27

opportunity to act when a protein is manufactured in abundance (Figure 2B; Supplementary

2

to N without accounting for its internal OLGs, ORF9b and ORF9c (e.g., at the between-host

level, p=0.0268 when excluding OLG regions, but p=0.411 when including them;

MT040335.1) yields OLG dN/dS=0.14 (p=0.264) (Figure 5), whereas inclusion of a third allele

7

found in pangolin-CoV GX/P4L (NCBI: MT040333.1) yields 0.43 (p=0.488) (Supplementary

8

Table 12). Because this is suggestive of constraint, we performed sliding windows of OLG

9

dN/dS across the length of ORF3a to check whether the evidence for purifying selection is

10

specific to the expected genome comparisons and genome positions. Indeed, pairwise

11

comparisons of each sequence to SARS-CoV-2 reveal OLG dN/dS<1 that is specific to the

12

reading frame, genome positions, and species in which ORF3d is intact (pangolin-CoV

13

GX/P5L) (Figure 6, left). This signal is independent of whether STOP codons are present, so

14

its consilience with the only intact ORF in this region and species is highly suggestive of

15

purifying selection. We note that this conclusion does not contradict studies which fail to find

16

evidence of ORF3d conservation when comparing taxa where ORF3d is absent (e.g.,

17

Jungreis et al. 2020), because ORF3d is a novel gene and would by definition lack such

18

conservation. This contrastive signal is also similar to what is observed for the known OLGs

19

ORF3b (in comparisons to SARS-CoV; Figure 6, right), and ORF9b and ORF9c (in both

20

viruses; Figure 6—figure supplement 1).

21
22

Between-host evolution and pandemic spread

23

Purifying selection can be specific to just one taxon, as in the case of novel genes. Thus, to

24

measure selection within SARS-CoV-2 only, we obtained n=3,978 high-quality human

25

SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from GISAID (accessed April 10, 2020; Supplementary

26

Table 13; GISAID Acknowledgments Table, supplementary data). Between-host diversity

27

was sufficient to detect marginally significant purifying selection across all genes

28

(πN/πS=0.50, p=0.0613, Z-test; Figure 5—figure supplement 2) but not most individual genes

(Figure 5). Therefore, we instead investigated single mutations over time, limiting to 27 high-

2

frequency variants (minor allele frequency ≥2%; Supplementary Table 14).

3

One high-frequency mutation occurred in ORF3d: G25563U, here denoted ORF3d-

4

LOF (ORF3d-loss-of-function), which causes a STOP codon in ORF3d (ORF3d-E14*) but a

5

nonsynonymous change in ORF3a (ORF3a-Q57H). This mutation is not observed in any

6

other species member included in our analysis (Figure 4; SARS-related-CoV_ALN.fasta,

7

supplementary data). During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, ORF3d-LOF

8

increased in frequency (Supplementary Table 15) in multiple locations (Figure 5—figure

9

supplement 2D; Supplementary Table 16), making this mutation a candidate for natural

10

selection on ORF3a, ORF3d, or both (Kosakovsky-Pond 2020). However, temporal allele

11

frequency trajectories (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D) and similar signals from

12

phylogenetic branch tests may also be caused by founder effects or genetic drift, and are

13

susceptible to ascertainment bias (e.g., preferential sequencing of imported infections and

14

uneven geographic sampling) and stochastic error (e.g., small sample sizes).

15

To partially account for these confounding factors, we instead constructed the

16

mutational path leading from the SARS-CoV-2 haplotype collected in December 2019 to the

17

haplotype carrying ORF3d-LOF. This path involves five mutations (C241U, C3037U,

18

C14408U, A23403G, G25563U), constituting five observed haplotypes (EP–3 → EP–2 →

19

EP → EP+1 → EP+1+LOF), shown in Table 2. Here, EP is suggested to have driven the

20

European Pandemic (detected in German patient #4; see footnote 3 of Table 2; Korber et al.

21

2020; Rothe et al. 2020); EP–3 is the Wuhan founder haplotype; EP–1 is never observed in

22

our dataset; and LOF refers to ORF3d-LOF. We then documented the frequencies and

23

earliest collection date of each haplotype (Table 2) to determine whether ORF3d-LOF

24

occurred early on the EP background.

25

Surprisingly, despite its expected predominance in Europe due to a founder effect,

26

the EP haplotype is extremely rare. By contrast, haplotypes with one additional mutation

27

(C14408U; RdRp-P323L) on the EP background are common in Europe, and ORF3d-LOF

28

occurred very early on this background to create EP+1+LOF from EP+1. Neither of these

1

two haplotypes was initially observed in China (Table 2), suggesting that they might have

2

arisen in Europe. Thus, we further partitioned the samples into two groups, corresponding to

3

countries with early founders (January samples) or only late founders (no January samples)

4

(Figure 7). In the early founder group, EP–3 (Wuhan) is the first haplotype detected in most

5

countries, consistent with most early COVID-19 cases being related to travel from Wuhan.

6

Because this implies that genotypes EP–3 and EP had longer to spread in the early founder

7

group, it is surprising that their spread is dwarfed by the increase of EP+1 and EP+1+LOF

8

starting in late February. This turnover is most evident in the late founder group, where

9

multiple haplotypes are detected in a narrow time window, and the number of cumulative

10

samples is always dominated by EP+1 and EP+1+LOF. Thus, while founder effects and drift

11

are plausible explanations, it is also worth investigating whether the early spread of ORF3d-

12

LOF may have been caused by its linkage with another driver, either C14408U (+1 variant)

13

or a subsequent variant(s) occurring on the EP+1+LOF background (Discussion).

14
15

Within-host diversity and mutational bias

16

Examination of within-host variation across multiple samples allows detection of recurrent

17

mutations, which might indicate mutation bias or within-host selection. To investigate these

18

possibilities, we obtained n=401 high-depth ‘intrahost’ human SARS-CoV-2 samples from

19

the Sequence Read Archive (Supplementary Table 17) and called SNPs relative to the

20

Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome. Within human hosts, 42% of SNPs passed our false-

21

discovery rate criterion (Methods), with a median passing minor allele frequency of 2% (21 of

22

1344 reads). Using these variants to estimate within-host diversity, ORF3d does not show

23

significant evidence of selection, with OLG πN/πS= 1.5 (p=0.584) (Figure 5). We also

24

examined six high-depth samples of pangolin-CoVs from Guangxi, but no conclusions could

25

be drawn due to low sequence quality (Methods; Supplementary Table 18).

26

To identify recurrent mutations, we next limited to samples for which the major allele

27

was also ancestral at each site (Wuhan-Hu-1 genotype). At such sites, precluding

28

coinfection by multiple genotypes, minor alleles occurring in more than one sample are

expected to be derived and recurrent (i.e., identical by state but not descent). For ORF3d,

2

we observe ORF3d-LOF as a minor allele in two (0.9%) of 220 samples (SRR11410536 and

3

SRR11479046 at frequencies of 1.9% and 4.6%, respectively). This proportion of samples

4

with a recurrent mutation is high but not unusual, as 1.8% of possible genomic changes

5

have an equal or higher proportion of recurrence. Additionally, no mutations in ORF3d recur

6

in >2.5% of samples (Figure 8). Thus, we find no evidence that within-host selection or

7

mutation pressure are involved in the spread of ORF3d-LOF. However, a small number of

8

other loci exhibit high rates of recurrent mutation, with five mutations independently

9

observed in >10% of samples (Methods; Figure 8). Surprisingly, another STOP mutation

10

(A404U; NSP1-L47*) is observed at low frequency in the majority of samples (Figure 8,

11

Figure 8—figure supplement 1), unexplainable by mutational bias and warranting

12

investigation.

14

Discussion

15

Our analyses provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 contains a novel overlapping gene

16

(OLG), ORF3d, that has not been consistently identified or fully analyzed before this study.

17

The annotation of a newly emerged virus is difficult, particularly in genome regions subject to

18

frequent gene gain and loss. Moreover, due to the inherent difficulty of studying OLGs, they

19

tend to be less carefully documented than non-OLGs; for example, ORF9b and ORF9c are

20

still not annotated in the most-used reference genome, Wuhan-Hu-1 (last accessed

21

September 26, 2020). Therefore, de novo and homology-based annotation are both

22

essential, followed by careful expression analyses using multi-omic data and evolutionary

23

analyses within and between species. In particular, we emphasize the importance of using

24

whole-gene or genome alignments when inferring homology for both OLGs and non-OLGs,

25

taking into account genome positions and all reading frames. Unfortunately, in the case of

26

SARS-CoV-2, the lack of such inspections has led to mis-annotation and a domino effect.

27

For example, homology between ORF3b (SARS-CoV) and ORF3d (SARS-CoV-2) has been

1

implied, leading to unwarranted inferences of shared functionality and subsequent claims of

2

homology between ORF3b and other putative OLGs within ORF3a (Table 1). Given the rapid

3

growth of the SARS-CoV-2 literature, it is likely this mistake will be further propagated. We

4

therefore provide a detailed annotation of Wuhan-Hu-1 protein-coding genes and codons in

5

Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively, as a resource for future studies.

6

Our study highlights the highly dynamic process of frequent losses and gains of

7

accessory genes in the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, with

8

the greatest functional constraint typically observed for the most highly expressed genes

9

(Figure 5—figure supplement 1). With respect to gene loss, while many accessory genes

10

may be dispensable for viruses in cell culture, they often play an important role in natural

11

hosts (Forni et al. 2017). Thus, their loss may represent a key step in adaptation to new

12

hosts after crossing a species barrier (Gorbalenya et al. 2006). For example, the absence of

13

full-length ORF3b in SARS-CoV-2 has received attention from only a few authors (e.g.,

14

Lokugamage et al. 2020), even though it plays a central role in SARS-CoV infection and

15

early immune interactions as an interferon antagonist (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007), with

16

effects modulated by ORF length (Zhou et al. 2012). Thus, the absence or truncation of

17

ORF3b in SARS-CoV-2 may be immunologically important (Yuen et al. 2020), e.g., in the

18

suppression of type I interferon induction (Konno et al. 2020). With respect to gene gain, the

19

apparent presence of the ORF3d coincident with the inferred entry of SARS-CoV-2 into

20

humans from a hitherto undetermined reservoir host suggests that this gene is functionally

21

relevant for the emergent properties of SARS-CoV-2, analogous to asp for HIV-1-M (Cassan

22

et al. 2016). The mechanisms and detailed histories of gene birth, neo-functionalization, and

23

survival of novel genes remain unclear. However, our findings that ORF3d remarkably

24

inherited its hydrophobicity profile from the overlapping region of ORF3a, that ORF3d is

25

depleted for predicted CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes, and that ORF3d exhibits potential

26

purifying selection between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV GX/P5L, provide strong leads

27

for further research. Indeed, both the structural and immunogenic properties of new viral

28

proteins deserve further attention and are important parts of their evolutionary story.

1

Failure to account for OLGs can also lead to erroneous inference of (or failure to

2

detect) natural selection in known genes, and vice versa. For example, a synonymous

3

variant in one reading frame is very likely to be nonsynonymous in a second overlapping

4

frame. As a result, purifying selection in the second frame usually lowers dS (raise dN/dS) in

5

the first frame, increasing the likelihood of mis-inferring positive selection (Holmes et al.

6

2006; Sabath et al. 2008; Nelson et al. 2020). Such errors could, in turn, lead to

7

mischaracterization of the genetic contributions of OLG loci to important viral properties such

8

as incidence and persistence. One potential consequence is misguided countermeasure

9

efforts, e.g., through failure to detect functionally conserved or immunologically important

10

regions.

11

Although our study focuses on ORF3d, other OLGs have been proposed in SARS-

12

CoV-2 and warrant investigation. ORF3d-2, a shorter isoform of ORF3d (Table 1), shows

13

evidence of higher overall expression than ORF3d (Figure 2A). However, analysis of full-

14

length ORF3d is confounded by its 20 codon triple overlap with both ORF3a and ORF3c,

15

making expression and selection results difficult to compare between the two isoforms.

16

Although not evolutionarily novel, the recently discovered ORF3c (Table 1) shows deep

17

conservation among viruses of this species (Cagliana et al. 2020; Firth 2020; Jungreis et al.

18

2020), the lowest πN/πS ratio observed in our between-host analysis (Figure 5), strong

19

evidence for translation in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2), and the highest predicted CD8+ T cell

20

epitope density (Figure 3). Within S, S-iORF2 (genome positions 21768-21863) also shows

21

evidence of translation from ribosome profiling (Finkel et al. 2020), and between-host

22

comparisons suggest purifying selection (πN/πS=0.22, p=0.0278) (Table 1). We therefore

23

suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 genome could contain additional undocumented or new

24

OLGs.

25

Our comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome demonstrates

26

that many genes are under relaxed purifying selection, consistent with the exponential

27

growth of the virus (Gazave et al. 2013). At the between-host level, nucleotide diversity

28

increases somewhat over the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic, tracking the number

1

of locations sampled, while the πN/πS ratio remains relatively constant at 0.46 (±0.030 SEM)

2

(Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). Other genes differ in the strength and direction of

3

selection at the three evolutionary levels, e.g. ORF9c (Figure 5), suggesting a shift in

4

function or importance over time or between different host species or individuals. ORF3d

5

and ORF8 are both among the youngest genes in SARS-CoV-2, being taxonomically

6

restricted to a subset of betacoronaviruses (Cui et al. 2019), and both exhibit high rates of

7

change and turnover (Figure 1; Figure 5; SARS-related-CoV_ALN.fasta, supplementary

8

data). High between-host πN/πS was also observed in ORF8 of SARS-CoV, perhaps due to a

9

relaxation of purifying selection upon entry into civet cats or humans (Forni et al. 2017).

10

However, ORF3d and ORF8 both exhibit strong antibody (B-cell epitope) responses (Hachim

11

et al. 2020) and predicted T-cell epitope depletion (Figure 3) in SARS-CoV-2. This highlights

12

the important connection between evolutionary and immunologic processes (Daugherty and

13

Malik 2012), as antigenic peptides may impose a fitness cost for the virus by allowing

14

immune detection. Thus, the loss or truncation of these genes may share an immunological

15

basis and deserves further attention.

16

The quick expansion of ORF3d-LOF (EP+1+LOF) and its haplotype (EP+1) during

17

this pandemic is surprising, given that a founder effect would have favored other variants

18

that arrived earlier. However, newer data show that ORF3d-LOF has remained at relatively

19

low frequencies compared to EP+1 variants (Kosakovsky-Pond 2020), and plausible

20

explanations exist which do not require invoking natural selection. First, the slower ‘spread’

21

of EP–3 and EP may be an artifact of a sampling policy bias in case isolation: testing and

22

quarantine were preferentially applied to travellers who had recently visited Wuhan, which

23

may have led to selective detection, isolation, and tracing of these haplotypes rather than

24

mutations occurring within Europe (e.g., C14408U and G25563U). However, the EP+1 and

25

EP+1+LOF haplotypes also increase faster in the late founder group, where it is unclear

26

which haplotype was more travel-related. Second, it is possible that the EP haplotype was

27

effectively controlled, while EP+1 was introduced independently (Worobey et al. 2020).

28

Third, although G25563U itself simultaneously causes ORF3a-Q57H and ORF3d-LOF, its

spread seems to be linked with RdRp-P323L, and both mutations are linked with Spike-

2

D614G, a variant with predicted functional relevance (Korber et al. 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al.

3

2020). Thus, it is possible that G25563U is neutral while a linked variant(s) is under

4

selection. These observations highlight the necessity of empirically evaluating the effects of

5

these mutations and their interactions. Lastly, because only five major polymorphisms are

6

considered in this analysis (Supplementary Table 14), it is possible that the spread of

7

ORF3d-LOF or other haplotypes was further assisted or hindered by subsequent mutations.

8

Our study has several limitations. First, we were not able to confirm the translation of

9

ORF3d using mass spectrometry (MS). This may be due to several reasons: (1) ORF3d is

10

short, and tryptic digestion of ORF3d generates only two peptides potentially detectable by

11

MS; (2) ORF3d may be expressed at low levels; (3) the tryptic peptides derived from ORF3d

12

may not be amenable to detection by MS even under the best possible conditions, as

13

suggested by its relatively low MS intensity even in an overexpression experiment (‘ORF3b’

14

in Gordon et al. 2020); and (4) hitherto unknown post-translational modifications of ORF3d

15

could also prohibit detection. Other possibilities for validation of ORF3d include MS with

16

other virus samples; affinity purification MS; fluorescent tagging and cell imaging; Western

17

blotting; and the sequencing of additional genomes in this viral species, which would

18

potentiate more powerful tests of purifying selection and a better understanding of the history

19

and origin of ORF3d. With respect to between-host diversity, we focused on consensus-level

20

sequence data; however, this approach can miss important variation (Holmes 2009),

21

stressing the importance of deeply sequenced within-host samples using technology

22

appropriate for calling within-host variants (Grubaugh et al. 2019). As we use Wuhan-Hu-1

23

for reference-based read mapping and remove duplicate reads as possible PCR artifacts,

24

reference bias (Degner et al. 2009) or bias against natural duplicates at high read depth loci

25

(Zhou et al. 2014) could potentially affect our within-host results. Additionally, we detected

26

natural selection using counting methods that examine all pairwise comparisons between or

27

within specific groups of sequences, which may have less power than methods that trace

28

changes over a phylogeny. However, this approach is robust to errors in phylogenetic and

ancestral sequence reconstruction, and to artifacts due to linkage or recombination (Hughes

2

et al. 2006; Nelson and Hughes 2015). Additionally, although our method for measuring

3

selection in OLGs does not explicitly account for mutation bias, benchmarking with other

4

viruses suggests inference of purifying selection is conservative (Nelson et al. 2020). Finally,

5

given multiple recombination breakpoints in ORF3a (Boni et al. 2020) and the relative

6

paucity of sequence data for viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, our analysis could not

7

differentiate between convergence, recombination, or recurrent loss in the origin of ORF3d.

8

In conclusion, OLGs are an important part of viral biology and deserve more

9

attention. We document several lines of evidence for the expression and functionality of a

10

novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2, ORF3d, and compare it to other hypothesized OLG candidates

11

in ORF3a. Finally, as a resource for future studies, we provide a detailed annotation of the

12

SARS-CoV-2 genome and highlight mutations of potential relevance to the within- and

13

between-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

quantified their entropy as -∑p*ln(p), where p is the number of distinct (unique) locations or countries

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus genome data and alignments

2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus genome IDs were obtained from Lam et al.

3

(2020) and downloaded from GenBank or GISAID. Genotype Wuhan-Hu-1 was used to represent

4

SARS-CoV-2. Except for pangolin-specific analyses, isolates GX/P5L (NCBI: MT040335.1; GISAID:

5

EPI_ISL_410540) and GD/1 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_410721) were used to represent pangolin-COVs;

6

GD/1 was chosen as a representative because the other Guangdong (GD) sequence lacks the S

7

gene and contains 27.76% Ns, while GX/P5L was chosen because it is one of two high-coverage

8

Guangxi (GX) sequences derived from lung tissue that also contains no Ns. Other sequences were

9

excluded if they lacked an annotated ORF1ab with a ribosomal slippage, or contained a frameshift

10

indel in any gene (Supplementary Table 6), leaving 21 sequences for analysis (Supplementary Table

11

5).

12

To produce whole-genome alignments, we first aligned all genome sequences using MAFFT.

13

Then, coding regions were identified using exact or partial sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 or

14

SARS-CoV annotations, translated, and individually aligned at the amino acid level using ProbCons

15

v1.12 (Do et al. 2005). In the case of OLGs, the longest (reference) protein was used (e.g., N rather

16

than ORF9b or ORF9c). Amino acid alignments were then imposed on the coding sequence of each

17

gene using PAL2NAL v14 (Suyama et al. 2006) to maintain intact codons. Finally, whole genomes

18

were manually shifted to match the individual codon alignments in AliView. Codon breaks were

19

preferentially resolved to align S/Q/T at 3337-3339, and L/T/I at 3343-3345. This preserved all

20

nucleotides of each genome while concurrently producing codon-aware alignments. The alignment is

21

available in the supplementary data as SARS-related-CoV_ALN.fasta, where pangolin-CoV GD/1 has

22

been removed because it is only available from GISAID (i.e., permission is required for data access).

23

Phylogenetic relationships among isolates were explored using maximum likelihood

24

phylogenetic inference, as implemented in IQ-tree (Nguyen et al. 2015), using the generalized time-

25

reversible (GTR; Tavaré 1986) substitution model combined with the FreeRate model (Soubrier et al.

26

2012) to account for among-site rate heterogeneity. Trees were rooted a priori following Lam et al.

27

(2020).

28

Proteomics analysis

29

We used MaxQuant (Tyanova et al. 2016) to re-analyze five publicly available SARS-CoV-2 mass

30

spectrometry (MS) datasets: Bezstarosti et al. 2020 (PRIDE accession PXD018760); Bojkova et al.

2

2020 (PXD019645). However, peptide spectrum matches for ORF3d (possible tryptic peptides

3

CTSCCFSER and FQNHNPQK) did not pass our 1% false-discovery threshold in any of these

4

datasets, and ORF3d-2 (Table 1) does not encode any peptides detectable by this method. ORF3c,

5

ORF9c, and ORF10 could also not be reliably detected. For peptides that were successfully detected

6

in the datasets of Bezstarosti et al. (2020) and Davidson et al. (2020), protein concentrations were

7

estimated using intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) (Schwanhäusser et al. 2011). iBAQ

8

values were computed using the Max-Quant software (Cox and Mann 2008) as the sum of all peptide

9

intensities per protein divided by the number of theoretical peptides per protein. Thus, iBAQ values

10

are proportional estimates of the molar protein quantity of a protein in a given sample, allowing

11

relative quantitative comparisons of protein expression levels.

12

Ribosome profiling analysis

13

The 16 ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) datasets of Finkel et al. (2020) using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero

14

E6 cells were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (accession numbers SRR11713354 to

15

SRR11713369). These samples comprise four treatments for ribosome stalling: (1) lactimidomycin

16

(LTM) or (2) harringtonine (Harr), which are biased towards stalling at translation initiation sites; (3)

17

cyclohexamide (CHX), which stalls along a gene during active translation; and (4) mRNA, which

18

serves as a control (i.e., total RNA content rather than ribosome footprints). Two time points are

19

represented: (1) 5 hours and (2) 24 hours post infection (hpi), labelled “05hr” and “4hr”, respectively,

20

in the SRA data. The FASTQ format reads were mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome using

21

Bowtie2 local alignment (Langmead et al. 2019), with a seed length of 20 and up to one mismatch

22

allowed, after substituting the isolate’s mutations, as listed in Finkel et al. (2020). Mapped reads were

23

then classified by read length and trimmed to the first (5′-end) nucleotide for downstream analyses.

24

NetMHCpan T-cell epitope analysis

25

For predicted MHC class I binding, viral protein sequences were analyzed in 9 aa substrings using

26

NetMHCpan4.0 (Jurtz et al. 2017). Twelve (12) representative HLA class I alleles (Sidney et al. 2008)

27

were tested: HLA-A*01:01 (A1), HLA-A*02:01 (A2), HLA-A*03:01 (A3), HLA-A*24:02 (A24), HLA-

28

A*26:01 (A26), HLA-B*07:02 (B7), HLA-B*08:01 (B8), HLA-B*27:05 (B27), HLA-B*39:01 (B39), HLA-

29

B*40:01 (B44), HLA-B*58:01 (B58), and HLA-B*15:01 (B62). NetMHCpan4.0 returns percentile ranks

3

0.5% to identify strong MHC class I binder. Both strong and weak binders were considered predicted

epitopes. For predicted MHC class II binding, viral protein sequences were analyzed in 15 aa

14

determine potential presented peptides, and 2% to identify strong MHC class II binder. Both strong

Hydrophobicity profile analysis

17

The sequence of ORF3a was translated in all three forward-strand reading frames and uploaded to

18

the VOLPES server (http://volpes.univie.ac.at/; Bartonek and Zagrovic 2019) to determine

19

hydrophobicity profiles using the unitless scale “FAC1” (Factor 1; Atchley et al. 2005) with a window

20

size of 25 codons. The correlations between the profiles for the reading frames were calculated for

21

peptides encoded by the following subregions of ORF3a, from 5′ to 3′: (1) ORF3a, codons not

22

overlapping any known or hypothesized overlapping genes; (2) ORF3a/ORF3c, encoding residues of

23

both ORF3a and ORF3c; (3) ORF3a/ORF3c/ORF3d, encoding residues of ORF3a, ORF3c, and

24

ORF3d; (4) ORF3a/ORF3d, encoding residues of both ORF3a and ORF3d; and (5) ORF3a/ORF3b,

25

encoding residues of both ORF3a and ORF3b. Spearman’s rank correlation was computed using

26

stats::cor.test() with method=’spearman’ in R, treating mean 25-residue window values as the

27

observational unit.

Statistics and tests of natural selection

2

All p-values reported in this study are two-tailed. Statistical and data analyses and visualization were

3

carried out in R v3.5.2 (R Core Team 2018) (libraries: boot, feather, ggrepel, patchwork,

4

RColorBrewer, scales, tidyverse), Python (BioPython, pandas) (McKinney 2010), Microsoft Excel,

5

Google Sheets, and PowerPoint. Colors were explored using Coolors (https://coolors.co). Copyright-

6

free images of a bat, human, and pangolin were obtained from Pixabay (https://pixabay.com). All

7

dN/dS or πN/πS ratios were estimated for non-OLG regions using SNPGenie scripts snpgenie.pl or

8

snpgenie_within_group.pl (Nelson et al. 2015; https://github.com/chasewnelson/SNPGenie), and for

9

OLG regions using OLGenie script OLGenie.pl (Nelson et al. 2020;

10

https://github.com/chasewnelson/OLGenie). All OLG dN/dS (πN/πS) estimates refer to dNN/dSN (πNN/πSN)

11

for the reference frame and dNN/dNS (πNN/πNS) for the alternate frame (ss12 or ss13), as described in

12

Nelson et al. (2020), because the number of SS (synonymous/synonymous) sites was insufficient to

13

estimate dSS (πSS). The null hypothesis that dN-dS=0 (πN-πS=0) was evaluated using both Z and

14

achieved significance level (ASL) tests (Nei and Kumar 2000) with 10,000 and 1,000 bootstrap

15

replicates for genes and sliding windows, respectively, using individual codons (alignment columns)

16

as the resampling unit (Nei and Kumar 2000). The main text reports only Z-test results, because this

17

test was used to benchmark OLGenie (Nelson et al. 2020) and appears to be more conservative. For

18

ASL, p-values of 0 were reported as the lowest non-zero value possible given the number of bootstrap

19

replicates. Benjamini-Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) or Benjamini-Yekutieli (Benjamini

20

and Yekutieli 2001) false-discovery rate corrections (Q-values) were used for genes (independent

21

regions) and sliding windows (contiguous overlapping regions), respectively.

22

Between-species analyses

23

Because uncorrected d values >0.1 were observed in between-taxa comparisons, a Jukes-Cantor

24

correction (Jukes and Cantor 1969) was applied to dN and dS estimates. For each ORF, sequences

25

were only used to estimate dN/dS if a complete, intact ORF (no STOPs) was present. Most notably, for

26

ORF3b, only the region corresponding to the first ORF in SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed, and these sites

27

were also considered an OLG region of ORF3a. The remaining 3’-proximal portion of ORF3a (codons

28

165-276) was considered a non-OLG region, and only genomes lacking the full-length ORF3b (i.e.,

29

those with mid-sequence STOP codons) were included in these estimates. Similarly, for ORF3d, only

30

SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV GX/P5L were analyzed for Figure 5. For this analysis, ORF3a codon

71 in SARS-CoV-2 (CTA) differed by two nucleotides from the same codon in pangolin-CoV GX/P5L

2

(TTT), resulting in a multi-hit approximation being employed by the OLGenie method (Nelson et al.

3

2020). Thus, for greater accuracy, we instead estimated changes in this codon using the method of

4

Wei and Zhang (2015) across two mutational pathways, which yields 0.5

5

nonsynonymous/nonsynonymous, 0.5 nonsynonymous/synonymous, and 1

6

synonymous/nonsynonymous changes. The region occupied by the triple overlap of

7

ORF3a/ORF3c/ORF3d (ORF3a codons 44-64; Table 1) was excluded from analysis for all three

8

genes. The following codons (or their homologous positions) were also excluded from all analyses: all

9

codons occupying a non-OLG/OLG boundary; codons 4460-4466 of ORF1ab, which constitute either

10

nsp11 or nsp12 depending on a ribosomal frameshift; codons 1-13 of E, which overlap ORF3b in

11

some genomes; codons 62-64 of ORF6, which follow a premature STOP in some genomes; codons

12

122-124 of ORF7a and 1-3 of ORF7b, which overlap each other; and codons 72-74 of ORF9c, which

13

follow a premature STOP in some genomes.

14

Cumulative haplotype frequencies

15

We defined haplotypes along the mutational path to EP+1+LOF using all five high-derived allele

16

frequency (DAF) mutations from Wuhan-Hu-1 to ORF3d-LOF. Subsequent mutations after ORF3d-

17

LOF were ignored in the haplotype analysis. Samples with missing data at any of the five loci were

18

removed from the haplotype analysis. We calculated the cumulative frequency of each haplotype in

19

Germany (where the EP haplotype is a documented founder) and five other countries with the most

20

abundant samples by the time of data accession. Cumulative frequencies were calculated as the total

21

number of occurrences of each haplotype collected each day, divided by the total number of samples

22

from the same country. Countries were subsequently divided into early founders and late founders to

23

investigate founder effects, where early founder countries tend to have several samples from January,

24

and late founder countries tend to have samples collected only after mid-February.

25

Within-host diversity

26

For within-host analyses, we obtained n=401 high-depth (at least 50-fold mean coverage) human

27

SARS-CoV-2 samples from the Sequence Read Archive (listed in Supplementary Table 17). Only

28

Illumina samples were used, as some Nanopore samples exhibit apparent systematic bias in calling

29

putative intrahost SNPs, and this technology has also been shown to be unsuitable for intra-host

analysis (Grubaugh et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed with BBDUK (Bushnell B. 2017. BBTools.

2

https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) and mapped against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence

3

using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) with local alignment, seed length 20, and up to 1

4

mismatch. SNPs were called from mapped reads using the LoFreq (Wilm et al. 2012) variant caller

5

with sequencing quality and MAPQ both at least 30. Only single-end or the first of paired-end reads

6

were used. Variants were dynamically filtered based on each site’s coverage using a binomial cutoff

7

to ensure a false-discovery rate of ≤1 within-host variant across our entire study (401 samples),

8

assuming a mean sequencing error rate of 0.2% (Schirmer et al. 2016).

9

To estimate π, numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous differences and sites were first

10

calculated individually for all genes in each of the 401 samples using SNPGenie (Nelson et al. 2015;

11

snpgenie.pl, https://github.com/chasewnelson/SNPGenie). OLG regions were then analyzed

12

separately using OLGenie (Nelson et al. 2020; OLGenie.pl,

13

https://github.com/chasewnelson/OLGenie). Because OLGenie requires a multiple sequence

14

alignment as input, a pseudo-alignment of 1,000 sequences was constructed for each OLG region in

15

each sample by randomly substituting single nucleotide variants according to their within-host

16

frequencies into the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome. For non-OLG and OLG regions alike, average

17

within-host numbers of differences and sites were calculated for each codon by taking the mean

18

across all samples. For example, if a particular codon contained nonsynonymous differences in two of

19

401 samples, with the two samples exhibiting mean numbers of 0.01 and 0.002 pairwise differences

20

per site, this codon was considered to exhibit a mean of (0.01+0.002)/401=0.0000299 pairwise

21

differences per site across all samples. These codon means were then treated as independent units

22

of observation during bootstrapping.

23

Pangolin samples refer to Sequence Read Archive records SRR11093266, SRR11093267,

24

SRR11093268, SRR11093269, SRR11093270, and SRR11093271. Only 179 single nucleotide

25

variants could be called prior to our FDR filtering, and samples SRR11093271 and SRR11093270

26

were discarded entirely due to low mapping quality. We also note that after our quality filtering, four

27

samples contain consensus alleles that do not match their reference sequence (available from

28

GISAID): P1E, P4L, P5E, and P5L (Supplementary Table 18).

Within-host recurrent mutations analyses

2

We assume that each host was infected by a single genotype. Under this assumption, the minor allele

3

of each segregating site within-host is either due to genotyping or sequencing artifacts, or new

4

mutations. Because there are very few loci with high-frequency derived alleles between hosts, and

5

because the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome is used as the reference in read mapping, we here only consider

6

within-host mutations that differ from this reference background. There are four possible bases at

7

each locus, A, C, G, and U, and three possible mutational changes away from the Wuhan-Hu-1

8

reference genome. For each locus, we calculate the number of samples matching the reference allele

9

as N=N1+N2, where N1 is the number of samples in which the Wuhan reference allele is the only

10

observed allele, and N2 is the number of samples in which the Wuhan reference allele is major allele.

11

Given N2, we further determined the number of samples carrying each of the three possible non-

12

reference alleles as NA, NC, NG, and NU. For example, if the reference allele was U, we calculated pA,

13

pC, and pG, where pAll=pA+pC+pG. If A was an observed non-reference allele, we calculated the

14

frequency of A as pA=NA/N. Thus, a larger frequency indicates the derived allele is observed in a high

15

proportion of samples (Figure 8). The within-host derived allele frequency (DAF) was estimated as the

16

total number of reads matching the observed minor allele divided by the total number of reads

17

mapped to the locus. If all reads matched the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference allele, then DAF=0. Five

18

mutations occur in more than 10% of samples, four of which are nonsynonymous, with their DAF

19

plotted in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. For this analysis, we did not apply the per-site FDR cutoff,

20

thus a DAF=0 is equivalent to the absence of reads mapped to the mutation, after reads are filtered

21

by sequence quality, mapping quality, and LoFreq’s default significance threshold (p=0.01).

Haplotypes are here defined by five high-frequency variants (rows 1-5), and other variants with lower frequency
on these backgrounds are ignored. EP-1 is not observed in the dataset.
b
This EP haplotype is first detected in German patient #4 and is a documented founder for coronavirus spread in
Germany (Rothe et al. 2020). Neither the EP nor EP+1 haplotypes were detectable between January 28 and
February 20, although they immediately became a major haplotype once EP+1 was detectable. Failure to detect
these two haplotypes during these three weeks could potentially be explained by ascertainment bias, e.g., lack of
testing for travel-independent cases.
c
This Shanghai sample (GISAID: EPI_ISL_416327) comprises 1.32% poly-Ns and failed our quality control
criteria, but is added here since it is potentially relevant to the origin of EP haplotype. Including this sample, the
EP haplotype is observed in Shanghai twice.
d
The earliest collection location and time are highly subject to collection and submission bias and do not
necessarily reflect where the mutation/haplotype first occurred.
e
There is likely a testing bias in the United States, as EP+1+LOF haplotype was often detected in Washington,
and EP+1 haplotype was not.
f
These numbers are based on 3853 samples from December 24 to April 1 at the time of GISAID accession that
passed both our quality control criteria for alignment and for this particular analysis (i.e., no ambiguous genotype
calls among the five SNPs in this table), unless otherwise stated.

coronavirus species members. Only genes downstream of ORF1ab are shown, beginning with S (Spikeencoding). (A) Four types of genes and their relative positions in the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome
(NCBI: NC_045512.2). Genes are colored by type: novel overlapping genes (OLGs) (gold; ORF3d only);
conserved OLGs (burgundy); accessory (green); and structural (blue). Note that ORF3b has been
truncated relative to SARS-CoV genomes, whereas ORF8 remains intact (i.e., has not been split into
ORF8a and ORF8b). (B) Genes with intact ORFs in each of the the 21 Severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus genomes. Gene positions are shown relative to each genome, i.e.,
homologous genes are not precisely aligned. Only the full-length versions of ORF3a and ORF3d are
shown (for shorter isoforms, see Table 1). Note that the first 20 codons of ORF3d overlap the last
codons of ORF3c (supplementary file SARS-CoV-2.gtf), such that the beginning of ORF3d involves a
triple overlap (ORF3a/ORF3c/ORF3d). ORF3b is full-length in only 3 sequences (SARS-CoV TW11,
SARS-CoV Tor2, and bat-CoV Rs7327), while the remaining sequences have either an early or a late
premature STOP codon (Supplementary Table 9). ORF8 is not novel in SARS-CoV-2 (contra Chan et

while gray indicates absence of a stop-to-stop ORF longer than 30 codons or presence outside of a
known canonical gene (not tested). Note that low p-values are expected for the non-overlapping genes.
Only the first of four SARS-CoV-2 ORFs homologous to ORF3b is shown (Figure 4; Supplementary

Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 gene expression in ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry datasets.
Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data were obtained from Finkel et al. (2020); mass spectrometry data
were obtained from Davidson et al. (2020) and Bezstarosti et al. (2020). Reads were trimmed to their
first (5′) nucleotide to minimize statistical dependence while preserving reading frame. Results are
shown after pooling samples treated with harringtonine (SRR11713360, SRR11713361) or
lactimidomycin (SRR11713358, SRR11713359) at 5 hours post-infection. (A) Ribosome profiling

fully (internal) overlapping genes. Annotated genes show an accumulation of 5′ ends of protected
reads upstream of the gene’s start site (grey dotted vertical line), peaking near the ribosome P-site
offset of -12 nt (red=maximum depth). Distributions are largely consistent across individual samples
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The ranges of the y axes vary according to expression level, with the
most highly expressed gene (N; Figure 2—figure supplement 2) having the largest range. (B)
Correlation between protein expression as estimated by mass spectrometry and ribosomal profiling.
‘iBAQ prop’ refers to the relative (proportion of maximum) protein intensity-based absolute
quantification (iBAQ) value (Schwanhäusser et al. 2011). Genes are denoted by shape and ordinally
colored by iBAQ prop from high (red) to low (blue). ‘Upstream peak’ refers to the maximum read depth
observed at the approximate P-site offset (red bars in Figure 2A), while mean read depths were
measured across each gene using 30 nt reads separately for in-frame (codon position 1) and out-offrame (codon positions 2 and 3) sites (non-overlapping gene regions only, except for ORF9b). (C)
Reading frame of ribosome profiling reads in the ORF3c/ORF3d region of ORF3a. Solid lines show
the fraction of reads in each frame, summed across samples in sliding windows of 30 nt (step size=1
nt; read length=30 nt). Color denotes frame: green=reference frame (ORF3a); burgundy=ss13, the
sense frame encoding ORF3c, whose codon position 3 overlaps codon position 1 of ORF3a; and
gold=ss12, the sense frame encoding ORF3d, whose codon position 2 overlaps codon position 1 of
ORF3a. Values are shown for the central nucleotide of each window, with shaded regions
corresponding to 95% binomial confidence intervals. Alternative frame translation is suggested where
a given frame (solid line) exceeds its average across the remainder of the gene (horizontal dashed
line; non-OLG regions of ORF3a). Vertical gray dotted lines indicate gene start and end sites. Gray
bars show read depth for each window, with a maximum of 2889 reads at genome position 25442.

spectrometry and ribosomal profiling for individual treatments and codon positions. Details as in
Figure 2B, except estimates are shown for all sites in a gene (All frames) and out-of-frame reads are
shown separately for codon positions (Codon pos) 2 and 3. ORF9b is a fully (internal) overlapping
gene occurring within N, with codon position 3 of ORF9b corresponding to codon position 1 of N. As a
result, codon position 3 of ORF9b is predominantly occupied by ribosomes translating N, the most
highly expressed gene, leading to overestimation of ORF9b expression (Codon pos 3; right).
Ribosome profiling read depth at codon position 1 exhibits a marginal Spearman’s rank correlation
with mass spectrometry for cycloheximide (CHX), harringtonine (Harr), and lactimidomycin (LTM)
treatments; however, as expected, all correlations for RNA-seq (mRNA), as well as reads mapping to
other codon positions, were not significant.

Figure 2—figure supplement 3. Reading frames occupied by the 5′ ends of ribosome profiling reads
as a function of read length. Processed, aligned reads from Finkel et al. (2020) were trimmed to their
5′ ends (first nt). Fractions of reads mapping to each codon position (x axis) are shown as a function
of read length (y axis; 26-32 nt) after pooling samples according to treatment (CHX=cycloheximide,
Harr=harringtonine, LTM=lactimidomycin, mRNA=RNA-seq) and time (hours post-infection; hpi).
Codon position is defined relative to gene start sites of annotated (canonical) non-overlapping genes,
excluding any overlapping gene regions. Gray bars show relative total counts for reads of different
lengths, with different scales for 5 hpi (lower coverage; max=284,608 reads at CHX/30nt) and 24 hpi
(higher coverage; max=3,149,251 reads at Harr/29nt). At 5 hpi, reads of length 29 and 30 nt tend to
have 5′ ends mapping to the correct protein-coding reading frame (codon position 1) of the gene in
which they occur, and also tend to be most abundant, as expected given the size of ribosomeprotected fragments (~30 nt). Samples from 24 hpi have flatter (left-shifted) read length distributions
and no clear frame signal. The horizontal dashed grey line corresponds to the expectation for RNA
fragments not protected by ribosomes, i.e., 33% of reads mapping to each codon position (random).

nucleotides (5′ ends) map to each genome position, colored according to read length. In each case,
the longer read lengths have 5′ ends that predominate at approximately -12 nt from the gene start site
(horizontal dashed lines, right), corresponding to the ribosome P-site offset (center of yellow
highlight). A peak in total read depth (grey bars) is also observed at this position, as seen in Figure
2A. Highly expressed canonical (N, M, S, and ORF7b) and overlapping (ORF9b) genes are shown on
the left, while ORF3a and its hypothesized overlapping genes are shown on the right. Note that
ORF9b begins shortly after N, such that the upstream peak of N occurs at position -22 nt relative to
the start site of ORF9b.

separately after pooling the two biological replicates for each treatment (CHX=cycloheximide,
Harr=harringtonine, LTM=lactimidomycin, mRNA=RNA-seq) (Finkel et al. 2020). Genes and their
reading frames are denoted by color according to Figure 1, with Frames 1, 2, and 3 corresponding to
the frames beginning at codon positions 1, 2, and 3 of ORF3a, respectively. Clear evidence for
translation in the appropriate reading frame is observed for ORF3c (burgundy) and ORF3d/ORF3d-2
(gold). The status of the first half of ORF3d is obscured by the signal of ORF3c, but the increase in
Frame 1 (ORF3a) reads and drop in proportion of Frame 2 (ORF3c) reads at the start of ORF3d is
suggestive of an otherwise-unexpected biological change at this locus.

correspond to the frames beginning at positions 1, 2, and 3 of the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome,
respectively. Expression of ORF9b is evidenced by a peak in the fraction of reads mapping to Frame
3 (burgundy) at the appropriate region, as well as a peak in read depth (gray bars) immediately
upstream (Figure 2A). Translational status of ORF9c is ambiguous, with minimal enrichment of reads
in the appropriate frame (burgundy) along the gene.

lower coverage (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) and exhibit frame-related periodicity. Evidence for
ORF3c (Frame 2; burgundy) is more pronounced using this read length, while the peak for ORF3d
(Frame 3; gold) occurs slightly later, overlapping ORF3d-2.

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence properties. (A) Predicted densities of MHC class I-bound
CD8+ T cell 9 aa epitopes (top) and MHC class II-bound CD4+ T cell 15 aa epitopes (bottom). Results
for proteins encoded downstream of ORF1ab are shown. Mean numbers of predicted epitopes per
residue (blue bars) are calculated as the number of epitopes overlapping each amino acid position
divided by protein length. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Two sets of negative controls were
also tested: (1) n=1,000 randomized peptides generated from each protein by randomly sampling its
amino acids with replacement (dark gray bars), representing the result expected given amino acid
content alone; and (2) short unannotated ORFs, the peptides encoded by n=103 putatively
nonfunctional ORFs present in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, representing the result expected for real
ORFs that have been evolving without functional constraint. For the short unannotated ORFs, the
horizontal gray dotted line shows the mean number of epitopes per residue, and the gray shaded region
shows the 95% confidence interval (i.e., 2.5% to 97.5% quantiles). ORF3d and N have the lowest MHC
class I epitope density; ORF3d, ORF3b, ORF7b, and ORF10 have the lowest MHC class II epitope
density. (B) Hydrophobicity profiles of amino acid sequences in the three forward-strand reading frames
of the ORF3a/ORF3c/ORF3d gene region, as calculated by the VOLPES server, using the unitless
“Factor 1” consensus hydrophobicity scale. Frame is reported using ORF3a as the reference, e.g., ss12
refers to the frame encoding ORF3d, for which codon position 2 overlaps codon position 1 of ORF3a
(Figure 2C).

Figure 4. Amino acid variation in proteins encoded by genes overlapping ORF3a in viruses of the
species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. (A) Amino acid sequences of ORF3c,
ORF3d, and ORF3b, as encoded by SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1; NCBI: NC_045512.2). Note that, while
ORF3b encodes a protein of 154 amino acids (aa) in SARS-CoV (NCBI: NC_004718.3), a premature
STOP codon in SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ORF encoding only 22 aa. (B) Amino acid alignments
of ORF3c, ORF3d, and ORF3b (3b) show their sequence conservation. Black lines indicate STOP
codons in ORF3d and ORF3b, showing their restricted taxonomic ranges. Intact ORF3d is restricted to
SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV GX/P5L; however, note that ORF3d-2 (denoted 3d-2), a shorter
isoform of ORF3d, could have a slightly wider taxonomic range if TTG or GTG are permitted as
translation initiation codons. Full-length ORF3b (ORF3b region) is found throughout members of this
virus species, but truncated early in most genomes outside of SARS-CoV (Supplementary Tables 2, 3,
4, and 8), with the shortest version (denoted 3b) found in SARS-CoV-2 and closely related viruses.

The full translation of the ORF3b region is provided for ORF3b. Note that the pangolin-CoV GD/1
sequence has been masked as X (license constraint), but can be acquired with GISAID registration.

Figure 5

Figure 5. Natural selection analysis of viral nucleotide differences at three hierarchical evolutionary
levels. Nucleotide differences in each virus gene were analyzed at three host levels: between-taxa
divergence (d) among Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus genomes infecting bat,
human, and pangolin species; between-host diversity (π) for SARS-CoV-2 infecting human individuals
(consensus-level); and within-host diversity (π) for SARS-CoV-2 infecting human individuals (deep
sequencing). Each gene/level is shaded according to the ratio of mean nonsynonymous to synonymous
differences per site to indicate purifying selection (dN/dS<1 or πN/πS<1; blue) or positive selection
(dN/dS>1 or πN/πS>1; red), except the value for ORF3c was artificially lowered to allow the display of
other ratios. A Jukes-Cantor correction was applied to dN/dS values. Values range from a minimum of
πN/πS=0.04 (ORF3c, between-host; p=0.0410, Q=0.308) to a maximum of 21.0 (ORF9b, between-host;
p=0.126, Q=0.453), where significance (Q) was evaluated using a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery
rate correction after Z-tests of the hypothesis that dN-dS=0 or πN-πS=0 (10,000 bootstrap replicates,
codon unit). The mean of all pairwise comparisons is shown for sequenced genomes only, i.e., no
ancestral sequences were reconstructed or inferred. For each gene, sequences were only included in
the between-species analysis if a complete, intact ORF (no STOPs) was present. Genes containing an
overlapping gene (OLG) in a different frame were analyzed separately for non-OLG and OLG regions
using SNPGenie and OLGenie, respectively. For ORF3b, only the region corresponding to the first ORF
in SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) was analyzed. The short overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b (nsp11 and
nsp12) was excluded from the analysis. Error bars represent the standard error of mean pairwise
differences. See Methods for further details.

Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Correlation between natural selection and gene expression. A weak
negative Spearman correlation between dN/dS and gene expression is observed across all three
evolutionary levels (between-taxa, between-host, and within-host). The x axes of different panels differ
by method for inferring gene expression, which are those shown in Figure 2B: (1) ‘Mass spec’ refers to
log10(iBAQ prop), where iBAQ prop is the proportion of the maximum intensity-based absolute
quantification (iBAQ) observed; (2) ‘Upstream peak’ is the peak in ribosome profiling read depth
upstream of the gene start site, measured for reads of length 29-31nt (Figure 2A); and (3) ‘In-frame
mean’ is the mean read depth at Codon pos 1, measured for reads of length 30nt (Figure 2B). A given
gene (color) has only one selection value (y-axis) per evolutionary level, and only one gene expression
value (x-axis) per method for determining expression. Selection was calculated as dN/dS (πN/πS) except
for the overlapping gene ORF9b, where the OLG-appropriate measure dNN/dNS (πNN/πNS) was used (see
Methods).

Figure 6. Between-taxa sliding window analysis of natural selection on overlapping frames of ORF3a.
Pairwise sliding window analysis (windows size=50 codons; step size=1 codon) of selection across
members of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. OLG-appropriate
dN/dS values were computed using OLGenie (Nelson et al. 2020), a method that is conservative (nonconservative) for detecting purifying (positive) selection, and a Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple hits
was employed. On the left-hand side, each genome is compared to SARS-CoV-2 in the ss12 reading
frame of ORF3a, which contains ORF3d (Table 1 and Figure 2C). This frame shows evidence for
purifying selection specific to the ORF3d region that is limited to the comparison with pangolin-CoV
GX/P5L. On the right-hand side, this analysis is repeated for the ss13 reading frame of ORF3a, which
contains ORF3c and ORF3b (Table 1 and Figure 2C), this time with respect to SARS-CoV, where fulllength ORF3b is functional. This frame shows constraint across much of this gene and virus species,
and that ORF3c in particular is deeply conserved.

Figure 7. Pandemic spread of the EP+1 haplotype and the hitchhiking of ORF3d-LOF. The mutational
path leading to EP+1+LOF is shown in the upper panel. Cumulative frequencies of haplotypes in
samples from Germany and five other countries with the most abundant sequence data are shown in
the lower panel. Countries are grouped into early founder (left) and late founder (right) based on the
presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 samples from January, respectively. In the early founder group,
EP–3 (gray) is observed earlier than other haplotypes in France and the US, and EP (red) is observed
early in Germany, giving them the advantage of a founder effect. However, neither EP nor EP–3
dominate later spread; instead, EP+1 (yellow) and EP+1+LOF (blue) increase much faster despite their
later appearance in these countries. In the late founder group, multiple haplotypes appear at
approximately the same time, but EP-3 and EP spread more slowly. The green dashed line shows the
combined frequencies of EP+1 and EP+1+LOF (yellow and blue, respectively). Note that EP–1 is never
observed in our dataset.
