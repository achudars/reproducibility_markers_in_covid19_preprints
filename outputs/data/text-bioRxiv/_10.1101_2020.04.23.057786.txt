SUMMARY

21

Coronaviruses (CoVs) emerge as zoonoses and cause severe disease in humans,

22

demonstrated by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. RNA recombination is

23

required during normal CoV replication for subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis and

generates defective viral genomes (DVGs) of unknown function. However, the

25

determinants and patterns of CoV recombination are unknown. Here, we show that

26

divergent b-CoVs SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) perform

27

extensive RNA recombination in culture, generating similar patterns of recombination

28

junctions and diverse populations of DVGs and sgmRNAs. We demonstrate that the

29

CoV proofreading nonstructural protein (nsp14) 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN)

30

is required for normal CoV recombination and that its genetic inactivation causes

31

significantly decreased frequency and altered patterns of recombination in both infected

32

cells and released virions. Thus, nsp14-ExoN is a key determinant of both high fidelity

33

CoV replication and recombination, and thereby represents a highly-conserved and

34

vulnerable target for virus inhibition and attenuation.

INTRODUCTION

41

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with

42

genomes ranging in size between 26 and 32 kb (Figure 1A and 3A). CoV recombination

43

has been reported to be associated with increased spread, severe disease, and vaccine

44

failure in livestock CoV epidemics (Chen et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018) and proposed

45

to be important in the emergence of human CoVs including the beta-CoVs (b-CoVs)

46

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Anthony et al., 2017;

Drosten et al., 2003; Hon et al., 2008; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005) and Middle

48

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Yusof et al., 2017; Zaki et al.,

49

2012). The ongoing severe global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of

50

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) underlines

51

the importance of defining the determinants of CoV evolution and emergence into

52

human populations (Paraskevis et al., 2020; Randhawa et al., 2020; Wahba et al., 2020;

53

Wong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Studies comparing CoV strains that are closely

54

related to SARS-CoV-2 have proposed that SARS-CoV-2 acquired the ability to infect

55

human cells through recombination within the spike protein sequence (Huang et al.,

56

2020; Li et al., 2020; Patiño-Galindo et al., 2020). Further, a study of genetic variation in

57

patient SARS-CoV-2 samples has suggested that recombination may be occurring

58

during infections in humans (Yi, 2020). Together, these data support the hypothesis that

59

generation of novel CoVs, cross-species movement, and adaptation may be driven by

60

recombination events in nature (Lau et al., 2015), and that CoV recombination can

61

result in increased virulence, pathogenicity, and potential pandemic spread.

62
63

Experimental recombination has been most studied in the model b-CoV murine hepatitis

64

virus (MHV). During mixed infections of related MHV strains, ~25% of progeny virions

65

are generated by recombination (Keck et al., 1988; Kottier et al., 1995; Lai et al., 1985;

66

Makino et al., 1986). During normal replication, the putative CoV replication-

67

transcription complex (RTC) performs discontinuous transcription at virus-specific

68

transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) (Figure 1A, 3A) to generate a set of

69

subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) with common 5’ leader sequences and 3’ ends, which

are subsequently translated into structural and accessory proteins (Dufour et al., 2011;

71

Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019; Subissi et al., 2014; Weiss et al., 1994). CoV replication

72

also generates defective viral genomes (DVGs) that contain multiple deletions of

73

genomic sequence. DVGs range in size from <1kb to >20kb, but retain intact 5’ and 3’

74

genomic untranslated regions (5’ and 3’ UTRs) and are amplified by RTC machinery

75

supplied by co-infecting full-length helper CoVs (Brian and Spaan, 1997; Makino et al.,

76

1985; Schaad and Baric, 1994; Wu and Brian, 2010). Therefore, CoVs perform

77

recombination as a normal part of their replication, producing complex populations of

78

recombined RNA molecules. Prior to the advent of next generation sequencing, direct

79

analysis of recombined CoV RNAs was not possible and the determinants of

80

recombination could not be identified.

81
82

In other RNA virus families including picornaviruses and alphaviruses, regulation of

83

recombination has been mapped to replication fidelity determinants in the viral RNA-

84

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Kempf et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019; Poirier et al.,

85

2015; Woodman et al., 2018). In contrast to these viruses, CoV replication fidelity is

86

primarily determined by the 3’-5’ exoribonuclease encoded in nonstructural protein 14

87

(nsp14-ExoN) that proofreads RNA during replication through excision of mismatched

88

incorporated nucleotides (Ferron et al., 2018a; Ma et al., 2015). Viral exonucleases are

89

essential for recombination in DNA viruses, including vaccinia virus (Gammon and

90

Evans, 2009) and herpes simplex virus 1 (Grady et al., 2017; Schumacher et al., 2012).

91

In contrast, the role of the CoV nsp14-ExoN in RNA recombination has not been

92

defined. Catalytic inactivation of nsp14-ExoN resulted in qualitatively reduced

abundance of MHV sgmRNA2 (Eckerle et al., 2007) and altered human CoV 229E

94

(HCoV-229E) sgmRNA detection during viral recovery (Minskaia et al., 2006). These

95

studies suggest that nsp14-ExoN RNA proofreading activity of CoVs may play a key

96

role in RNA recombination in addition to known functions in replication fidelity, viral

97

fitness and virulence, resistance to nucleoside analogs, and immune antagonism (Case

98

et al., 2017; Ferron et al., 2018a; Graepel et al., 2019).

99
100

In this study, we sought to define the frequency and patterns of recombination of

101

divergent b-CoVs SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and MHV. We show that all three viruses

102

perform extensive recombination during replication in vitro, with broadly similar patterns

103

of recombination, generating diverse populations of recombined molecules. We further

104

demonstrate that genetically engineered inactivation of MHV nsp14-ExoN activity

105

results in a significant decrease in recombination frequency, altered recombination

106

junction patterns across the genome, and altered junction site selection. These defects

107

and alterations result in a marked change in MHV-ExoN(-) recombined RNA

108

populations, including defective viral genomes (DVGs). Previous studies our lab and

109

others confirm the requirement of ExoN activity in high-fidelity replication, exclusion of

110

aberrant nucleotides, viral fitness, and virulence (Eckerle et al., 2007, 2007; Ferron et

111

al., 2018a; Graham et al., 2012). Combined with the multiple critical integrated functions

112

of nsp14-ExoN, the demonstration in this study that nsp14-ExoN activity is required for

113

WT-like recombination further defines it as an exceptionally conserved, vulnerable, and

114

highly specific target for inhibition by antiviral treatments and viral attenuation. These

115

results also support future studies aimed at illuminating the role of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-

RESULTS

120

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV undergo extensive RNA recombination to generate

121

populations of recombination junctions. We first sought to quantify recombination

122

frequency and identify recombination patterns in zoonotic CoVs by sequencing both

123

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

124
125

Vero CCL-81 cells were infected with MERS-CoV derived from an infectious clone at

126

passage 1 with an MOI of 0.3 pfu/mL for 72 hours until >70% cytopathic effect was

127

observed. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 derived from a patient isolate

128

passaged in culture (passage 5) at an MOI of 0.45 pfu/mL for 60 hours until >70%

129

cytopathic effect was observed. Total RNA from infected cells was isolated and poly(A)-

130

selected to capture all genomic and subgenomic RNA, as well as defective viral

131

genomes (DVGs). Equal amounts of total cell RNA from both viruses was sequenced by

132

short-read Illumina RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and long-read direct RNA Nanopore

133

sequencing. The depth and low error rate of RNA-seq facilitated the quantification and

134

detection of both high- and low-abundance unique junctions, but did not allow for

135

detection of junctions in the context of a full-length RNA molecule. Long-read direct

136

RNA sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform was used to

137

sequence complete RNA molecules. By combining both short- and long-read RNA

138

sequencing, we accomplished high-confidence quantification and detection of

139

recombination junctions as well as description of the genetic architectures of molecules

140

formed by the junctions.

141
142

For RNA-seq, we generated libraries in triplicate from 2 µg samples of both MERS-CoV

143

and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Reads were aligned to the respective viral genomes

144

using a recombination-aware mapper, ViReMa (Virus Recombination Mapper) (Routh

145

and Johnson, 2014). ViReMa detects non-homologous recombination events resulting

146

in subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) and defective viral genomes (DVGs) by identifying

147

recombination junctions that generate a deletion greater than 5 base-pairs flanked on

148

both sides by a 25 base-pair alignment. ViReMa aligned both recombined and non-

149

recombined reads in the library and reported the total number of nucleotides aligned to

150

the genome and all detected recombination junctions (Figure S1A-B).

151
152

MERS-CoV RNA contained an average of 19,367 detected junctions per dataset and

153

SARS-CoV-2 libraries had an average of 56,082 detected junctions per dataset. To

154

normalize for variations in library size between samples, recombination junction

155

frequency (Jfreq) was calculated for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B). Jfreq

156

refers to the number of nucleotides in all detected junctions normalized to total mapped

157

nucleotides in a library. MERS-CoV had a mean Jfreq of 37.80 junctions detected per

158

10,000 mapped nucleotides. SARS-CoV-2 had a mean Jfreq of 475.7 junctions per

159

10,000 mapped nucleotides (Figure 1B). To define the patterns of these detected

160

recombination junctions, we mapped forward (5’ à 3’) recombination junctions

161

according to their genomic position (Figure 1C-D, Figure S1C-D). Both MERS-CoV and

162

SARS-CoV-2 displayed clusters of junctions between the 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome,

163

intermediate genomic positions and the 3’ end of the genome, and within the 3’ end of

164

the genome (Figure 1B-C). SARS-CoV-2 also had many low-frequency junctions

165

distributed across the genome, a major cluster of junctions representing local deletions

166

and between the 5’ UTR and the rest of the genome, and horizontal clusters of low-

167

frequency junctions between common start sites at position ~2000 and ~8000 and the

168

rest of the genome (Figure 1D). Overall, these data demonstrate that extensive RNA

169

recombination in both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 generates diverse populations of

170

junctions with similar high-abundance clusters.

171
172

To determine whether high-frequency recombination occurs randomly across MERS-

173

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we calculated mean positional recombination

174

frequency (Figure 1E-F) by comparing the number of nucleotides in detected junctions

175

(both start and stop sites) at that position normalized to nucleotide depth at that

176

position. The first and last 5000 nucleotides of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

177

genomes showed clusters of recombination (Figure 1E-F). SARS-CoV-2 had many

178

peaks of recombination frequency of greater than 0.50 (50%) across the genome

179

(Figure 1F), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 generates a diverse set of RNA molecules

180

with distinct genetic architectures through recombination.

181

Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 defines the

183

architecture of full-length genome, subgenomic RNAs, and defective viral

genomes.

185

We performed direct RNA Nanopore sequencing on the same RNA used for short-read

186

RNA-seq. For both viruses, three independent sequencing experiments were performed

187

on triplicate samples of 2 µg RNA for each virus. In order to remove prematurely

188

truncated sequences, we bioinformatically filtered for Nanopore reads containing both

189

genomic termini. Capture and sequencing of sgmRNAs and DVGs resulted in high

190

sequencing coverage at both ends of the genome, while the relatively poorer capture of

191

full-length genomes was limited due to their extreme length and resulting in depleted

192

coverage in the middle of the genome (Figure 2A-B). We sequenced 132,493 MERS-

193

CoV RNA molecules and 1,725,862 SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules that had 85.6% and

194

82.2% identity to the parental genome, respectively (Table S1). We obtained 3 full-

195

length direct RNA sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome containing over 29,850

196

consecutive nucleotides that aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table S2). In MERS-

197

CoV RNA, we detected 451 unique junction-containing full-length molecules (Figure 2A,

198

Table S3). SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained distinct 172,191 junction-containing molecules

199

(Figure 2B, Table S2).

200
201

To define the architectures of detected molecules, we filtered for junctions with at least

202

3 supporting Nanopore reads. In MERS-CoV, we defined 5 distinct species, including 3

203

sgmRNAs (6, 7, and 8) and 2 DVGs (Figure 2C). In SARS-CoV-2, there were 1166

204

isoforms with a single junction and 227 containing 2 junctions. Because the TRS

205

sequences and sgmRNA species have not previously been experimentally confirmed in

206

SARS-CoV-2, a Nanopore read was categorized as a predicted sgmRNA transcript if it

207

had a junction between the predicted 5’ TRS-L and the predicted structural and

208

accessory open reading frames to include both canonical and non-canonical sgmRNAs.

209

The 15 most abundant isoforms in SARS-CoV-2 included 7 predicted sgmRNA

210

transcripts and 8 DVGs (Figure 2D). We also identified potential alternative transcripts

211

corresponding to a single gene (ORF8) (Figure 2D). In summary, direct RNA Nanopore

212

sequencing defined a diverse set of recombined RNAs generated by both MERS-CoV

213

and SARS-CoV-2. The results confirmed and extended the short-read RNA-seq

214

datasets. Our results are likely an underestimate of total numbers and diversity based

215

on the conservative bioinformatic limitation of analysis to isoforms with at least 3

216

supporting reads. Thus, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 engage in extensive RNA

217

recombination during replication in cell culture, producing diverse junctions across the

218

viral genomes and many recombined RNA isoforms, with the indication that SARS-CoV-

219

2 recombination exceeds that of MERS-CoV in Vero cells. These findings underline the

220

importance of defining the determinants of CoV recombination.

221
222

The b-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) lacking nsp14-ExoN activity has

223

significantly decreased and altered distribution of RNA recombination events. In

224

picornaviruses and alphaviruses, recombination is regulated by determinants of

225

replication fidelity (Kempf et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019; Poirier et al., 2015; Woodman et

226

al., 2018). CoVs encode a 3’-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN) in non-structural protein 14

227

(nsp14) that regulates replication fidelity by RNA proofreading (Eckerle et al., 2007;

228

Ferron et al., 2018b; Minskaia et al., 2006). No proofreading-deficient nsp14-ExoN

229

catalytic mutant has been rescued in MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. We have rescued

230

and extensively studied ExoN catalytic inactivation mutants (ExoN(-)) in b-CoVs murine

231

hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV. We used MHV and compared an engineered

232

ExoN catalytic inactivation mutant (MHV-ExoN(-)) to wild-type virus (MHV-WT). Murine

233

delayed brain tumor cells (DBT-9) were infected in triplicate with either MHV-WT or

234

MHV-ExoN(-) at an MOI of 0.01 pfu/mL and total infected cell monolayer RNA was

235

extracted when the monolayer was 95% involved in cytopathic effect and >75% intact.

236

To isolate virions, DBT-9 cell were infected in triplicate with either MHV-WT or MHV-

237

ExoN(-) at an MOI of 0.01 pfu/mL and virions were isolated by ultracentrifugation from

238

supernatant collected when the monolayer was 95% involved in cytopathic effect and

239

>90% intact. RNA-seq datasets were aligned to the MHV genome using ViReMa,

240

reporting the genomic coverage in infected cells (Figure S2A-B) and virions (Figure

241

S3A-B). To determine whether loss of nsp14-ExoN activity alters recombination, we

242

quantified recombination junction frequency (Jfreq) in MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-). We

243

found that MHV-ExoN(-) had significantly decreased Jfreq relative to MHV-WT in both

244

infected cells (Figure 3B) and virions (Figure 3D).

245
246

We next tested whether loss of nsp14-ExoN activity altered the population of junction

247

sites. Recombination junctions detected by ViReMa were plotted according to their start

248

(5’) and stop (3’) sites in infected cell RNA (Figure 3C, Figure S2C-D) and virion RNA

249

(Figure 3E, Figure S3C-D). MHV-WT displayed clusters of junctions (i) between the 5’

250

and 3’ ends of the genome, (ii) between intermediate genomic positions and the 3’ end

251

of the genome, (iii) between the 5’ UTR and the rest of the genome, (iv) in local

252

deletions across the genome, and (v) within the 3’ end of the genome (Figure 3C and

253

3E). Similarly, MHV-ExoN(-) accumulated junction clusters between the 5’ and 3’ ends

254

of the genome and within the 3’ end of the genome (Figure 3C and 3E). However, MHV-

255

ExoN(-) had fewer junctions between the 5’ UTR and the rest of the genome and fewer

256

junctions forming local deletions (Figure 3C and 3E). Together, these findings show that

257

loss of MHV nsp14-ExoN activity resulted in decreased recombination frequency and

258

altered junction patterns across the genome.

259
260

Loss of nsp14-ExoN activity alters recombination in distinct genomic regions. To

261

determine whether the engineered defect in nsp14-ExoN alters recombination across

262

the genome, we calculated and compared mean positional recombination frequencies of

263

MHV-WT (blue) and MHV-ExoN(-) (orange) in both infected cell monolayers (Figure 4A)

264

and virions (Figure 4B). MHV-WT has high recombination frequency at the 5’ and 3’

265

ends of the genome as well as at distinct sites across the genome. MHV-ExoN(-) has a

266

similar distribution in both infected cells and virus particles (Figure 4A-B). There were

267

765 positions in infected cell RNA and 499 positions in virion RNA (Table S4) with

268

significantly altered recombination frequency in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT.

269

These differences are best illustrated when the distinct genomic regions are separately

270

visualized (Figure S4).

271
272

In the 5’ UTR, nucleotides within the TRS-leader (TRS-L, yellow) participate in

273

recombination junctions in both MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-) as expected, although

274

MHV-ExoN(-) has significantly decreased recombination frequency at all sites within the

275

TRS-L (Figure S4A, Table S4). Both MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-) display recombination

276

across the nonstructural proteins, although MHV-ExoN(-) demonstrates overall

277

decreased recombination in these regions compared with MHV-WT (Figure S4B-C,

278

Table S4). In virions, MHV-ExoN(-) has significantly increased recombination in nsp3,

279

nsp4, and two positions in nsp12 (Figure S4B-C, Table S4). In addition, MHV-ExoN(-)

280

has significantly increased recombination at one position within the 3’ untranslated

281

region (3’-UTR) (Figure S4E, Table S4).

282
283

MHV-ExoN(-) has decreased subgenomic mRNA populations and increased

284

abundance of defective viral genomes. We next determined whether loss of nsp14-

285

ExoN activity influences sgmRNA patterns and abundance, as proposed in earlier

286

studies (Eckerle et al., 2007; Minskaia et al., 2006). We quantified recombination

287

junction frequencies (Jfreq) of each of the known junctions formed between the common

288

TRS-L and 6 sgmRNA-specific body TRSs. sgmRNA Jfreq refers to the number of

289

nucleotides corresponding to the sgmRNA leader-body junction normalized to mapped

290

library size. sgmRNAs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were significantly decreased in MHV-ExoN(-)

291

infected cell RNA (Figure 4C). sgmRNA 4 and 6 were present at significantly decreased

292

frequencies in MHV-ExoN(-) virions compared to MHV-WT (Figure 4D). Thus, MHV-

293

ExoN(-) has altered frequency of multiple sgmRNAs both in infected cells and in virus

294

particles.

295
296

We further defined alterations to different populations of recombined RNA molecules in

297

MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT by quantifying the percentages of sgmRNA and

298

DVG junctions in the total population of detected junctions. Any junction that did not

299

form a canonical leader-body TRS junction was considered a DVG junction, likely

300

including a subset of previously undefined non-canonical or alternative sgmRNA

301

junctions. The percentage of sgmRNA junctions were significantly decreased and the

302

percentage of DVG junctions significantly increased in both infected cell RNA (Figure

303

4E) and virion RNA (Figure 4F). These findings demonstrate that loss of nsp14-ExoN

304

activity alters the locations at which the replicase machinery recombines across the

305

genome, resulting in both decreased and altered sgmRNAs and relatively increased

306

percentage of DVGs in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT. Thus, catalytic inactivation

307

of nsp14-ExoN results in a defect in recombination site selection.

308
309

Differential abundance of recombination junctions in MHV-ExoN(-) reveals altered

310

recombination junction site selection. We next defined the distribution of

311

recombination junctions with altered abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT.

312

We quantified the abundance junctions identified over three independent experiments

313

and identified junction populations with altered abundances in MHV-ExoN(-) compared

314

to MHV-WT using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). MHV-ExoN(-) RNA contained distinct

315

junction populations with both significantly increased and decreased abundance relative

316

to MHV-WT in infected cells (Figure S5A, Table S5) and in virus particles (Figure S5B,

317

Table S5). We mapped significantly altered junctions by their genomic position (Figure

318

4G-H). Recombination junctions enriched in MHV-ExoN(-) were mainly found between

319

the 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome (Figure 4G-H). This observation suggests that MHV-

320

ExoN(-) is accumulating altered populations of DVGs that are formed by these

321

deletions.

323

Junctions with decreased abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT in both

324

infected cells (Figure 4G) and virions (Figures 4H) mainly clustered between the 5’ UTR

325

and the rest of the genome. Further, infected cell RNA demonstrates a cluster of

326

junctions with decreased abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) in the 3’ end of the genome that

327

represent local deletions in this region (Figure 4G). This finding was complemented by

328

the cluster of decreased abundance of local deletions of 10 – 50 bp in length across the

329

genome in MHV-ExoN(-) virion RNA (Figure 4H). Together, these findings demonstrate

330

that the populations of recombination junctions that were differentially abundant in MHV-

331

ExoN(-) were not randomly distributed across the genome. This suggests that loss of

332

nsp14-ExoN activity results in altered recombination site selection in distinct regions of

333

the genome.

334
335

Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing identifies defects in MHV-ExoN(-) full-length

336

recombined RNA populations. To test the alterations of full-length recombined RNAs

337

due to loss of nsp14-ExoN proofreading activity, we sequenced MHV-WT and MHV-

338

ExoN(-) virion RNA by direct RNA Nanopore sequencing. Reads were mapped to the

339

MHV genome using minimap2 and mapped reads containing both genomic termini were

340

identified. MHV-WT virion RNA contained 101,714 complete molecules and MHV-

341

ExoN(-) virion RNA yielded 19,334 (Table S1). Reads mapping to the full-length

342

parental genome were not observed, likely due to the length (31.4 kb) of the MHV

343

genome, and datasets yielded only sgmRNAs and DVGs. MHV-ExoN(-) consistently

344

demonstrated ~1 log10 reduction in nucleotide depth at positions across the genome

345

relative to MHV-WT (Figure 5A). This finding directly corroborated the decreased

346

recombination junction frequency of MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT demonstrated

347

in short-read Illumina RNA-seq datasets (Figure 3B).

348
349

Consistent with fewer full-length molecules sequenced, MHV-ExoN(-) had a global

350

decrease in the number of junctions across the genome (Figure 5B). Because

351

molecules with multiple junctions in a single molecule were detected but not supported

352

by more than one read, they were excluded from downstream analyses. We next

353

mapped junctions detected in full-length RNA molecules according to their genomic

354

position (Figure 5C). While MHV-WT contains 852 unique junctions present in full-length

355

molecules, MHV-ExoN(-) had only 43 (Table S3). MHV-WT recombination junctions

356

exclusively connect positions in the first ~8,000 nucleotides of the genome to the 3’ UTR

357

(Figure 5C). MHV-ExoN(-) had fewer junction sites, none of which represented distinct

358

clusters (Figure 5D). We next grouped junctions within 10-base pair windows to define

359

distinct families of molecules supported by at least three reads. Nine such architectures

360

were identified in MHV-WT (Figure 5E). These populations contain both DVGs and

361

sgmRNAs. The four most abundant isoforms were also detected in MHV-ExoN(-) virion

362

RNA, which corresponded to a DVG and sgmRNAs 4,6 and 7 (Figure 5E). We did not

363

detect MHV-ExoN(-)-unique variants with at least 3 supporting reads, potentially due to

364

their low frequency in the population and the limited depth of Nanopore sequencing.

365

Additionally, all junctions generating RNA molecules found in MHV-WT and MHV-

366

ExoN(-) were present in short-read RNA-seq datasets. These data demonstrate that

367

loss of nsp14-ExoN activity drives the accumulation altered recombined RNA

368

populations and DVG species diversity.

DISCUSSION

371

In this study, we define the diversity of the CoV recombination landscape in MHV,

372

MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also demonstrate that the loss of nsp14-ExoN

373

activity in MHV results in decreased recombination and alters site selection of

374

recombination junctions. Our results support a model in which nsp14-ExoN activity

375

functions during replication to drive normal recombination, leading to the generation of

376

populations of discrete molecules, including sgmRNAs and DVGs.

377
378

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have extensive recombination networks producing

379

diverse populations of RNA species. We show that both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

380

2, the etiological agent of the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, performs

381

extensive recombination and generates diverse populations of RNA molecules. SARS-

382

CoV-2 demonstrated relatively increased recombination frequency compared to MERS-

383

CoV and displayed unique clusters of recombination junctions across the SARS-CoV-2

384

genome. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 propagated from a clinical isolate that had been

385

passaged in cell culture, while MERS-CoV was generated from an isogenic clone of low

386

passage. It is possible that the differences could be the result of the diversity and

387

composition of the original sample or propagation in different cell types. Alternatively,

388

these differences may be due to alterations in transcription and RNA synthesis kinetics

389

in SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV, which have not been previously defined. It

390

will be important for future studies to determine the role of the diversity of the viral

391

population, cell environment, and virus-specific RNA synthesis kinetics in viral

392

recombination. Nevertheless, both viruses perform extensive, high-frequency

393

recombination and generate diverse species of recombined RNAs.

394
395

Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION

396

platform has sequenced sgmRNAs and DVGs in the alpha-coronavirus human

397

coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Viehweger et al., 2019) and has been utilized to

398

identify putative sgmRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 (Kim et al., 2020; Taiaroa et al., 2020).

399

Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing further revealed the profound diversity of RNA

400

species produced by SARS-CoV-2 during infection and yielded the first reported full-

401

length, continuous direct RNA reads of SARS-CoV-2. The full-length genome

402

sequences are currently the longest and most complete direct RNA Nanopore

403

sequences reported for any CoV. Detection of multiple RNA molecules with similar but

404

distinct genetic architectures corresponding to a single open reading frame suggests

405

that SARS-CoV-2 produces alternative transcripts. Tandem genetic and proteomic

406

studies of sgmRNA species in SARS-CoV-2 will be valuable to experimentally define

407

populations of translated SARS-CoV-2 sgmRNAs their role in viral replication.

408
409

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) incorporates diverse recombinant RNA in its virions.

410

Comparison of recombination in MHV-infected cells and virus particles (virions)

411

revealed that the observed recombination patterns and species generated in infected

412

cells are largely retained in virions. Specifically, we observed three previously

413

unexpected recombination junction clusters: (1) junctions connecting the canonical 5’

414

TRS-L to non-canonical positions across the genome; (2) junctions representing small

415

local deletions distributed evenly across the genome; and (3) local recombination within

416

the 3’ end of the genome, including structural proteins and the 3’ UTR. This result was

417

surprising based on earlier studies reporting the requirement of specific packaging

418

signals for incorporation of select RNA species into the virions (Kuo and Masters, 2013).

419

Our direct RNA Nanopore sequencing studies show that MHV virions contain a diverse

420

population of recombined RNA molecules which exclude the canonical MHV packaging

421

signal at position 20,273 – 20,367 (Kuo and Masters, 2013). Thus, MHV may have

422

much lower barriers for packaging a diverse population of RNA species than previously

423

known, which may aid in the transmission and accumulation of DVGs even under low-

424

MOI conditions.

425
426

MHV lacking nsp14-ExoN activity has globally decreased and altered

427

recombination. MHV-ExoN(-) demonstrated a global decrease in recombination

428

junction frequency in both infected cells and virions while also exhibiting skewed

429

populations of sgmRNAs, an increased proportion of DVGs, and altered populations of

430

recombinant isoforms. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for nsp14-ExoN in CoV

431

RNA recombination and further suggest that loss of nsp14-ExoN activity results in

432

altered recombination site selection. Decreased recombination frequency at canonical

433

TRSs in MHV-ExoN(-) suggest that there is decreased accumulation of sgmRNAs. This

434

finding is supported by previous studies (Eckerle et al., 2007; Minskaia et al., 2006) that

435

report a defect in MHV-ExoN(-) sgmRNA synthesis. Perturbation of the abundance of

436

each sgmRNA will likely have a profound influence on the fitness and virulence of CoVs

437

as sgmRNAs encode critical viral proteins including nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and

19

438

many accessory ORFs that impact replication efficiency and counteract host innate

439

immune responses (Cruz et al., 2011; Muth et al., 2018).

440
441

MHV-ExoN(-) virion RNA demonstrates a significant increase in recombination in five

442

distinct genomic regions: 1) nsp3, 2) nsp4, 3) nsp12, 4) the spike (S) protein, and 5) the

443

3’ UTR. Previous studies show that CoV DVGs frequently contain sequences from the

444

first replicase proteins after the 5’ UTR (Kim et al.; Makino; Makino et al., 1984, 1988;

445

Penzes et al., 1996). Increased recombination in nsp3 and nsp4 may be the result of

446

altered DVG formation and increased accumulation in virus particles. Some of the

447

detected DVGs may be non-canonical sgmRNAs, containing junctions near the TRSs

448

and potentially encode novel translation reading frames (Di et al., 2017; Viehweger et

449

al., 2019).

450
451

Loss of MHV nsp14-ExoN activity results in altered recombination site selection.

452

Differential abundance analysis, mapping of junction detected in multiple experiments,

453

and direct RNA Nanopore sequencing suggest that defective nsp14-ExoN activity drives

454

altered recombination site selection resulting in different populations of accumulated

455

molecules. In this model, abrogation of nsp14-ExoN activity would cause altered

456

replicase activity, resulting in selection of aberrant sites, potentially based on sequence

457

or structural elements. In both picornaviruses and alphaviruses, low fidelity mutant

458

viruses have altered polymerase speed and processivity (Campagnola et al., 2015) and

459

these properties contribute to recombination and the generation of defective interfering

460

particles (Kim et al., 2019; Langsjoen et al., 2020; Poirier et al., 2015). The MHV-ExoN(-

461

) replicase may have altered protein-protein interactions that change the stability of the

462

complex and drive altered site selection. Alternatively, loss of nsp14-ExoN activity may

463

result in defective replicase-RNA interactions and therefore cause altered RNA

464

recombination site selection. In both models, nsp14-ExoN activity is an important

465

determinant of replicase activity during RNA synthesis and recombination. However,

466

there are likely other determinants of recombination in the CoV replicase that will be

467

important to define through future genetic and structure-function studies.

468
469

In this study, we identify key positions across the genome that are involved in

470

recombination junctions in the model b-CoV, MHV and we establish nsp14-ExoN

471

proofreading activity as a key determinant of recombination in b-CoVs. Our previous

472

studies of MHV nsp14-ExoN findings genetics and functions have been directly

473

reproduced in SARS-CoV (Agostini et al., 2018; Eckerle et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2013).

474

Thus, we would predict that SARS-CoV-2, will demonstrate the requirement of nsp14-

475

ExoN activity for recombination. Further, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with small

476

molecules that target the replicase proteins including nsp14-ExoN may result in an

477

altered recombination landscape and perturb viral fitness. It will be important for future

478

studies to assess the role of RNA proofreading, replication fidelity, and small molecule

479

antivirals in recombination of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the relationship between

480

protein determinants in RNA recombination will provide new targets for countermeasure

481

development to combat emergence of novel CoVs from animal reservoirs with

482

pandemic potential.

METHOD DETAILS

628

Viruses. All MHV work was performed using the recombinant WT strain MHV-A59

629

(GenBank accession number AY910861.1 (Yount et al., 2002)) at passage 4 and an

630

engineered ExoN(-) strain of MHV-A59 at passage 2. Experiments involving MERS-CoV

631

were conducted using the human EMC/2012 strain recovered from an infectious clone

632

(GenBank accession number JX869059.2) (Scobey et al., 2013). Experiments involving

633

SARS-CoV-2 were conducted with a passage 5 virus inoculum generated from a

634

Seattle, WA, USA COVID-19 patient (GenBank accession number MT020881.1). All

635

virus manipulations were performed under stringent BSL-3 laboratory conditions

636

according to strict protocols designed for safe and controlled handling of MERS-CoV

637

and SARS-CoV-2.

638

MHV isolation and virion purification. Subconfluent 150-cm2 flasks were infected with

639

either MHV-A59 or MHV-ExoN(-) at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. Supernatant was

640

harvested at either 16 hours post infection (MHV-A59) or 24 hours post infection (MHV-

641

ExoN(-)) when the monolayer was >95% fused and remained intact. Infection

642

supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Viral

643

particles were purified on a 30% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 RPM

644

at 4°C for 16 hours. The viral pellet was resuspended in MSE buffer (10mM MOPS, pH

645

6.8; 150mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA). Viral RNA was extracted using the TRIzol-LS reagent

646

according to manufacturer’s protocols. RNA was quantified using the Qubit RNA HS

647

assay. Virion data in this paper is the result of three independent experiments

648

sequenced independently.

649

MHV isolation from infected monolayers. Three subconfluent 150-cm2 flasks of DBT-

650

9 cells were infected with either MHV-WT or MHV-ExoN(-) at an MOI or 0.01 PFU/cell.

651

Monolayer was harvested at either 16 hpi (MHV-WT) or 24 hpi (MHV-ExoN(-)) when the

652

monolayer was >95% fused and >75% intact. RNA was extracted with TRIzol according

653

to manufacturer’s protocols. Infected monolayer data in this paper is the result of three

654

independent experiments sequenced independently.

655

MERS-CoV infection. Three nearly confluent 25-cm2 flasks of Vero CCL-81 cells were

656

infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.3 pfu/cell. Total infected cell lysates were

657

collected at 72 hpi with the monolayer < 50% intact. RNA was extracted in TRIzol

658

according to manufacturer’s protocols.

659

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Five subconfluent 25-cm2 flasks of Vero E6 cells were infected

660

at an MOI = 0.45 pfu/cell and cellular monolayers were harvested 60 hpi when the

661

monolayer was >90% fused. RNA was extracted in TRIzol according to manufacturer’s

662

protocols.

was selected during library preparation. Isolated RNA was heat fragmented and libraries

667

were prepared for 2 x 250 nucleotide paired-end sequencing performed (Illumina).

668

Genewiz performed basecalling and read demultiplexing.

669

Direct RNA Nanopore sequencing. RNA from ultracentrifuge-purified virions was

670

prepared for direct RNA Nanopore sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies

671

MinION platform according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Libraries were sequenced

672

on fresh MinION R9.4 flow-cells for 24 hours, or until the pore occupancy was under

673

20%. Virion RNA from three independent experiments was sequenced on three

674

separate flow cells for both MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-). MERS-CoV RNA from three

675

independent cultures was sequenced on three separate flow cells. SARS-CoV-2 RNA

676

isolated from three independent infections was sequenced on three separate flow cells.

692

alignment map (SAM) file was processed using the samtools (Li et al., 2009) suite to

693

calculate nucleotide depth at each position in a sorted binary alignment map (BAM) file

694

(using command line parameters samtools depth -a -m 0

695

696

Recombination junction analysis. Recombination junction frequency (Jfreq) was

697

calculated by comparing the number of nucleotides in detected recombination junctions

698

to the total number of mapped nucleotides in a library. Nucleotides in detected

699

recombination junctions were quantified as a sum of nucleotide depth reported at each

700

junction in the BED file generated by ViReMa. Total nucleotides mapped to the MHV-

701

A59 genome were quantified as a sum of nucleotide depth at each position across the

702

genome in the tab-delineated text file generated by the samtools. Jfreq was reported as

703

junctions per 104 nucleotides sequenced. Mean Jfreq values were compared between

704

MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-) and statistical significance determined by an unpaired

705

student’s t-test. Junctions were mapped across the genome according to their start (5’)

706

and stop (3’) positions. These junctions were first filtered in the forward (5’ à 3’)

707

direction using the dpylr package (RStudio). The frequency of each junction was

708

calculated by comparing the depth of the unique junction to the total number of

709

nucleotides in all detected junctions in a library. Junctions were plotted according to the

710

genomic position and colored according to log10 of the frequency using ggplot2 in

711

RStudio.

712

Recombination frequency was calculated at each genomic position by dividing the

713

number of nucleotides in any junction mapping to the position divided by the total

714

number of nucleotides sequenced at the position. Mean recombination frequencies

715

were compared between MHV-WT and MHV-ExoN(-) for three independent sequencing

716

experiments by a two-way ANOVA statistical analysis with multiple comparisons.

717

Identification of sgmRNA and DVG junctions. Forward recombination junctions were

718

classified as either canonical sgmRNA junctions or DVG junctions based on the position

719

of their junction sites and filtered in Microsoft Excel. Briefly, junction start sites were

720

filtered to those positioned between nucleotide 62 – 72 in the genome. The stop sites

721

were then filtered for those positioned within each respective sgmRNA TRS. sgmRNA

722

frequency was calculated by dividing the sum of the depth of all junctions corresponding

723

to an individual sgmRNA by the total number of mapped nucleotides at each position.

724

The filtered sgmRNA junctions were compiled and DVG junctions were filtered in

725

RStudio by performing an exclusionary anti_join() using dplyr. DVG junctions

726

were filtered in the forward direction. The percentage of sgmRNA and DVG junctions

727

was calculated by comparing the depth of all filtered sgmRNA or DVG junctions to the

728

sum of all detected forward junctions. Mean percent sgmRNA and DVG was compared

729

between three independent sequencing experiments in virion RNA. Statistical

730

significance was determined by a 2-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons.

731

Differential abundance of junctions. To compare the abundance of junctions in MHV-

732

A59 and MHV-ExoN(-), the ViReMa output list of junctions was analyzed by in-house

733

scripts (https://github.com/DenisonLabVU) and the R package DESeq2 (Love et al.,

734

2014). Junctions significantly up- or down-regulated in MHV-ExoN(-) were visualized

735

using bioinfokit (Bedre, 2020) and further mapped according to their genomic

736

positions. Statistical significance was determined by the p-value of each junction

737

calculated by the DESeq2 package in RStudio and junctions with a significant alteration

738

of abundance in MHV-ExoN(-) compared to MHV-WT were visualized as either red or

739

green in the graph generated by bioinfokit.

740

Direct RNA Nanopore alignment and analysis. Live basecalling was performed by

741

Guppy in MinKNOW. Run statistics were generated from each sequencing experiment by

742

NanoPlot (De Coster et al., 2018). Pass reads from all three experiments were

743

concatenated for each virus and aligned to the genome using minimap2 (Li, 2018) and

744

FLAIR (Full Length Alternative Isoforms of RNA) (Tang et al., 2018) to generate

745

alignment files and BED files listing deletions detected in each sequenced RNA

746

molecule. Both BAM and BED files were filtered for full length molecules using

747

samtools and Microsoft Excel, respectively. Full-length MHV molecules were defined

748

as encoding coverage at positions 71 and 31034, representing the canonical TRS-L and

749

beginning of the 3’ UTR required for replication. Because no TRS sequences have been

750

experimentally confirmed in either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, we filtered both

751

datasets for those that included any sequence of the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR of the

752

respective viruses. BED files generated by the flair align module were parsed based on

753

the number of junctions were identified. Nanopore reads containing only 1 junction were

754

identified using Microsoft Excel and unique junctions were quantified in RStudio using

755

base-R functions. Sequencing coverage maps were generated from samtools depth

756

analysis of filtered BAM files. All junctions present in sequenced libraries were mapped

in Sashimi plots generated by the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) (Robinson et al.,
