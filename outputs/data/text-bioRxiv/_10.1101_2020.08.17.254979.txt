Abstract
Since the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in human breastmilk, little is known about the antiviral property of human breastmilk
to SARS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for
the first time that whey protein from human breastmilk effectively inhibited both
SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V by blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry
viral replication. Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production
proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as
cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk
also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of
breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus
activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anticoronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2
and its related virus of GX_P2V. These results rule out whey protein as a direct-acting
inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection and replication and further
investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.

Introduction

Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, it imposes a great
threat to global public health. COVID-19 resulted in high rate of infected patients and
the collapse of health systems in several countries(1, 2). It is reported by world Health
Organization (WHO) that more than 18 million people are SARS-CoV-2 positive and
over 700 thousand people died by COVID-19.
As a novel pathogen in human, SARS-CoV-2 could transmit and lead to disease
among various population, including pregnant women(1, 3, 4). Despite no evidence to
support the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it has been reported that SARS-CoV2 RNA could be detected in human breastmilk(3, 5). Considering that breastmilk can
inhibit some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus
(CMV) and dengue virus(6, 7), we supposed that breastmilk could also inhibit SARSCoV-2 infection.
It is well known that milk has a rich source of biologically active components of
valuable proteins, minerals and vitamins. Interestingly, the protein fraction has many
kinds of biological functions. In particular, milk has antibacterial and antiviral
properties(7). It was reported that milk components show antiviral activity against the
HIV, HCMV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)(8-10). The Lactoferrin from the milk was
reported to show antiviral activity and inhibition of intracellular HCV replication(11,

12). However, it is still unknown whether human breastmilk show anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity and protect the newborn from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Here, we performed the study of the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and its related
pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V) by whey protein in cultured cell lines.

Material and methods

Collecting and handling of milk samples.
Breastmilk was collected via pumps into sterile containers after disinfecting nipples
with 75% ethanol. Samples were frozen in aliquots at -80°C. Skim milk was prepared
by centrifuging the samples for 15 min at 4,000  g at 4°C and the lower aqueous phase
was used for further experiments and analysis. Mothers were informed consent. They
were not infected with hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV. This study was approved by
the ethics committees of the Medical Center.

Cell lines, coronavirus, and key reagents
Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) and A549 cells
were grown in high-glucose-containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum(13). SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was kindly
shared by Prof. Youchun Wang (National Institutes for Food and Drug Control,
China)(14). GX_P2V was described recently(15). Goat and cow whey protein were
purchased from Sigma (USA). The recombined lactoferrin (rLF), human lactoferrin
(hLF) and bovine lactoferrin (bLF) were purchased from Sigma (USA).

Viral infection assay
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection was performed as described(14). The cells were
infected with viral inocula of 650 TCID50/well. One day post infection (1dpi), the cells

were lysed and the luminescence was measured according to the manufacture’s protocol.
Cells were infected with GX_P2V at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 as
described(13). The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of GX_P2V and GAPDH were
determined by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR)(13).

Plaque assay for determining virus titer
The plaque assay for determining virus titer was performed as previously described(13).
Briefly, confluent monolayer Vero E6 cells were infected with GX_P2V with ten-fold
dilution from 10-1 to 10-6. After removing the virus, the cells were washed by PBS and
added with 1% agarose overlay to prevent cross contamination. At 5 dpi, cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1h, followed by staining with Crystal violet for 10
min and washed with water. The plaques were counted and virus titers were calculated.

Blocking assay
To study whether the inhibition effects of skimmed breastmilk on SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus and GX_P2V by binding cell surface to block viral entry, Vero E6 cells
were seeded at the 96 well plate with 20,000 cells/well. The skimmed breastmilk at a
final concentration of 4mg/ml was added in the wells. After washing away the free
breastmilk the next day, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and
cultured for 24h. The luminescence was measured to reflect the viral infection and
replication.

Viral attachment assay
Vero E6 cells were seeded at the 96 well plate with 20,000 cells/well one day before
the infection. Breastmilk at a final concentration of 4mg/ml was mixed with SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus (650 TCID50/well) and GX_P2V (MOI=10) at 4°C for 1h. The
mixture was added into the cells and put at 4°C for 2h to allow viral attachment to cells.
After washing out of free virus, cell surface GX_P2V was extracted and quantified by
RT-qPCR(16). For pseudovirus, the free viruses were washed away and incubated at
37℃ for 24h. The luminescence was measured to reflect the viral infection and
replication.

Viral entry assay
Breastmilk at a final concentration of 4mg/ml was mixed with SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus (650 TCID50/well) and GX_P2V (MOI=10) at 4 °C for 1h. Vero E6 cells
were exposed to the mixture at 37°C for 1h to allow viral internalization into cells.
GX_P2V mRNA was measured by RT-qPCR. For pseudovirus, the free viruses were
washed away and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 24h. The luminescence was
measured.

Viral post-entry assay
Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (650 TCID50/well) and
GX_P2V (MOI=0.01) and incubated at 37°C for 1h, respectively. After washing out of

the free viruses, the cells were cultured in the media containing breastmilk at a final
concentration of 4mg/ml for 24h (SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus) and 72h (GX_P2V),
respectively. Intracellular SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was measured by luminescence
and GX_P2V was measured by RT-qPCR.

Viral RNA extraction and quantification
The RT-qPCR for GX_P2V RNA quantification was performed as previously
described(13). Briefly, total RNA was extracted by the AxyPrep™ multisource total
RNA Miniprep kit (Axygene, USA). First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was
synthesized by a Hifair II 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit with gDNA digester (Yeasen
Biotech, China) and quantified by Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen
Biotech, China). The primer sequences were listed in Supplementary Table 1. The RTqPCR amplification of the Taqman method was performed as follows: 50 °C for 2 min,
95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 1 min.

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described previously(17). Briefly, the samples were
loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane.
Antibody against nucleocapsid protein of anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Genscript, USA)
and GAPDH of anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, USA) were used at 1:3000 dilutions. The
second antibody of HRP-conjugated affinipure Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) were
diluted

at

1:20000.

Results

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus by human breastmilk
To determine the potential inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by human breastmilk, we infected
the Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of 650 TCID50/well in the presence
of human skim breastmilk (4mg/ml) until the end of the experiment. At 24 hours post
infection (hpi), we harvested the cells and monitored the luciferase expression, which
reflects the infection of SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig.1A, all the skim breastmilk
from different donors effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with inhibition
efficiency more than 98%.
To confirm the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by human breastmilk, we did serial 2-fold
dilution of the breastmilk and tested their inhibition. As shown in Fig.1B-1H, the
inhibition efficiency of breastmilk was doses dependent. Breastmilk could inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 at a low concentration with different concentration for 50% of maximal
effect (EC50) of the donors: N17A (EC50=0.25mg/ml) (Fig.1B), N30 (EC50=0.29mg/ml)
(Fig.1C), N45 (EC50=0.02mg/ml) (Fig.1D), N49 (EC50=0.16mg/ml) (Fig.1E), N62
(EC50=0.02mg/ml) (Fig.1F), N66 (EC50=0.05mg/ml) (Fig.1G), N68 (EC50=0.25mg/ml)
(Fig.1H), indicating that the concentration of the effective factors for SARS-CoV-2
inhibition showed individual difference. Interestingly, breastmilk showed low
cytotoxicity with cytotoxicity concentration 50% (CC50) more than 3mg/ml. These
results indicated that human breastmilk showed high anti-SARS-CoV-2 property.

Inhibition of GX_P2V by human breastmilk
As reported recently, the SARS-CoV-2 related virus of GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino
acid identity in spike protein with SARS-CoV-2, which is a suitable model for SARSCoV-2 infection research(13). In this study, we also utilized GX_P2V to study the
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by human breastmilk. Vero E6 cells were infected with
mixtue of GX_P2V virus (MOI=0.01) and human breastmilk (4mg/ml). As shown in
Fig. 2A, all the breastmilk from different donors showed nearly 100% of inhibition on
the infectivity of GX_P2V.
Next, we did serial 2-fold dilution of human breastmilk and tested their inhibition
effects. Similar to the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, GX_P2V virus was
inhibited doses dependently by human breastmilk. The EC50 of breastmilk from
different

donors

were

different:

N30

(EC50=0.57mg/ml)

(Fig.2B),

N45

(EC50=0.34mg/ml) (Fig.2C), N62 (EC50=0.84mg/ml)(Fig.2)，N66 (EC50=0.79mg/ml)
(Fig.2E) and N68 (EC50=0.67mg/ml) (Fig.2F). Interestingly, human breastmilk didn’t
show any cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells (CC50>3mg/ml), and even promoted cells
proliferation. In all, human breastmilk could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 related virus of
GX_P2V.

Inhibition of infectious virus production by human breastmilk
To investigate the impact of human breastmilk on infectious virus production,
experiments were performed. Vero E6 cells were infected by GX_P2V at a MOI of 0.01
in the presence of human breastmilk at concentration of 4, 0.8 and 0.16mg/ml,

respectively. As shown in Fig.3A, after 72 hpi, GX_P2V RNA level increased during
the dilution of breastmilk. Similarly, western blotting assay showed that GX_P2V
nucleocapsid protein expression was highest in 0.16 mg/ml of breastmilk treatment but
lowest in 4mg/ml of breastmilk (Fig.3B). These results were further proved by the
inhibition of GX_P2V virus. Then, we did serial 10-fold dilution of the supernatant
from the breastmilk treated group and infected the Vero E6 cells seeded in the dishes.
After 5 dpi, we did the plaque assays. As shown in Fig.3C, the plaque assays showed
that live viruses were positive in all the dishes and gradually decreased during the
dilution of control group. However, when treated by 4mg/ml of breastmilk, all the
dishes showed no live viruses. The live viruses could be found in the group of 0.16
mg/ml breastmilk treatment at the dilution of supernatant less than 1000 folds. The
dilution of virus titers from 0.16 mg/ml breastmilk treatment less than 100000 folds still
showed infectious virus. These results confirmed that breastmilk also inhibit SARSCoV-2 related coronavirus infection.

The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by whey protein from different species
To rule out whether whey protein in breastmilk play the important role in the inhibition
of viral infection, we inactivated the protein by high temperature of 90 °C for 10 mins
and protease K digestion, respectively, and test their role in viral inhibition. As shown
in Fig.4A, the inhibition rate in breastmilk with treatment by heat and protease K
showed limited inhibition of viral infection, indicating that whey protein none other
factors in breastmilk has antiviral properties. Similar results were showed in A549 cell

line (Fig.4B).
To investigate if whey protein from other species could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and
GX-P2V infection, we selected cow and goat whey protein and performed the
experiments. The Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at a MOI
of 650 TCID50/well treated with serial 2-fold dilution of commercial bovine milk
(Aptamil, Australia). As shown in Fig.4C, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection could
be inhibited by commercial bovine milk doses dependently. When treated with human
skimmed breastmilk, cow and goat whey protein at concentration of 4mg/ml, SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus infection was also inhibited by whey protein from all the species.
The inhibition by human skimmed breastmilk was significantly higher than that by cow
and goat whey protein (Fig.4D). Similar results were observed in the GX_P2V infection
experiments (Fig.4E). These results indicated that breastmilk from different species
could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, but with different inhibitory efficiency.

The impact of Lactoferrin and IgA antibody on SARS-CoV-2 virus
It is reported that lactoferrin has broad anti-viral effects(7). To determine if the
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus by lactoferrin, we treated the cells with virus and each
of recombinant lactoferrin (rLF), bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and human lactoferrin (hLF)
at concentration of 1mg/ml, respectively. Human breastmilk (1mg/ml) was used as
control. As shown in Fig.5A, all the LFs showed limited inhibition to SARS-CoV-2
virus compared to the skimmed human breastmilk. Similarly, lactoferrin showed
limited inhibition of GX_P2V (Fig.5B), indicated that there would be other factors in

milk inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It also reported that IgA antibody from recovered COVID-19 patients inhibited
SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro(18). However, the breastmilk we collected was in 2017,
which mothers didn’t experience the COVID-19. To exclude the potential IgA antibody
impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we utilized the neutralized anti-IgA antibody
(1mg/ml) with different dilution to mix with the breastmilk (1mg/ml). As shown in
Fig.5C, the different dilution of anti-IgA antibody didn’t influence the SARS-CoV-2
infection, indicating that IgA antibody from breastmilk is not the key factor inhibiting
viral infection.

The impact of whey protein on viral attachment, entry and post-entry replication
To further determine which step in the coronavirus life cycle was affected by whey
protein of human breastmilk, we performed following experiments. Generally, SARSCoV-2 attaches to cells and subsequently internalizes into cells through endocytosis,
which leads to intracellular viral replication. The attachment of GX_P2V was
significantly decreased in the whey protein treated cells (Fig.6A). These data were
consistent with the results of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Fig.6E), two viruses share the
similar mechanisms during the viral internalization process.
To examine the process after attachment, we mixed the breastmilk with GX_P2V for
1h at room temperature. Vero E6 cells were incubated with the mixture at 37 ºC for 1h.
Then we harvested the cells and detected the viral RNA by RT-qPCR and normalized
by GAPDH level. As shown in Fig.6B, the entry process of GX_P2V was significantly

inhibited by breastmilk, which was consistent with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
results (Fig.6F). To examine the post-entry replication process, we infected the cells
with GX_P2V at 37 ºC for 1h, then removed the supernatant and treated the cells with
breastmilk (4mg/ml). The GX_P2V level showed that human breastmilk could also
inhibit post-entry viral replication (Fig.6C). In addition, to investigate the blocking
activity of human whey protein on SARS-CoV-2, we mixed the breastmilk before the
viral infection. Then, we washed the cells with PBS 5 times and infected SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus for 24h. As shown in Fig.6D, both breastmilk treatment before and during
the infection showed high inhibition efficiency to SARS-CoV-2. These results clearly
suggested that human breastmilk plays a significant inhibition role in SARS-CoV-2 and
related virus (GX_P2V) attachment, entry and replication.

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that whey protein from human
breastmilk significantly inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin
coronavirus (GX_P2V) in cells model study. Breastmilk could not only block viral
attachment and entry, but also inhibit post-entry viral replication.
Because of biosafety consideration, we did not directly use wild live SARS-CoV-2,
but used pseudovirus and GX_P2V in the present study. Studies demonstrate that
pseudovirus is suitable for neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2(14, 19). GX_P2V,
which was identified from the pangolins recently, shared 92.2% amino acid of spike
protein with SARS-CoV-2 and also infected the cells through binding the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor(13, 15). This virus would be a suitable
alternative model for SARS-CoV-2 related research and studied at biosafety level-2,
which could be studied in many labs. In our present study, we found that human
breastmilk inhibited the infectivity of both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V,
with EC50<0.2mg/ml. The anti-coronavirus property of human breastmilk was
confirmed in in vitro study with two different but closely related coronavirus and also
two different cell lines of Vero E6 and A549 cells. Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that
human breastmilk has the property of prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.
As we all known, human breastmilk contains different concentrations of the
components among different species, such as cow and goat(11). They also have
different antimicrobial activity(11). In the present study, we also revealed that whey
protein from cow and goat inhibited the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979; this version posted August 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

GX_P2V, although the inhibition efficiency was relatively lower compared to that of
human whey protein. These results indicated that human whey protein has high
concentration of antiviral factors than those from other species.
It was reported that human milk is rich in LF (3-5g/L in mature milk), which is 10100 fold higher than that in cow and goat milk(20). In addition, LF is the most
prominent antimicrobial component in milk(11). However, our results showed that
either hLF or bLF showed limited anti-coronavirus activity compared the skimmed
milk, indicating that LF is less likely to be a key component to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
Since milks of cow and goat contain much lower concentration (0.02–0.2mg/mL) of LF
than human breastmilk (1-7mg/ml), the findings that milks of cow and goat inhibited
the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 also suggest that LF is not the active component to
inactivate SARS-CoV-2(21). Besides LF, specific immunoglobulins are also important
for the host defense system(18). It was reported that IgA antibody from the recovery
patients blocks the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2(18). As the human
breastmilk samples were collected before the emergence of COVID-19, the breastmilk
donors should have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2
specific IgA was negative in the human breastmilk samples used in the present study
and antibodies directed against human IgA did not offset the inhibition of human
breastmilk on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V. Therefore, the
inhibition of whey protein on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is not due to the IgA
antibody. Together, these results suggested that other mechanism may be responsible
for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of whey protein, which merits further study.
