Learning biology, and in particular systematics, requires learning a substantial amount of
speciﬁc vocabulary, both for botanical and zoological studies. While crucial, the precise
identiﬁcation of structures serving as evolutionary traits and systematic criteria is not per se
a highly motivating task for students. Teaching this in a traditional teaching setting is quite
challenging especially with a large crowd of students to be kept engaged. This is even more
difﬁcult if, as during the COVID-19 crisis, students are not allowed to access laboratories for
hands-on observation on fresh specimens and sometimes restricted to short-range
movements outside their home.
Here we present QuoVidi, a new open-source web platform for the organisation of large scale
treasure hunts. The platform works as follows: students, organised in teams, receive a list of
quests that contain morphologic, ecologic or systematic terms. They have to ﬁrst understand
the meaning of the quests, then go and ﬁnd them in the environment. Once they ﬁnd the
organism corresponding to a quest, they upload a geotagged picture of their ﬁnding and
submit this on the platform. The correctness of each submission is evaluated by the staff.
During the COVID-19 lockdown, previously validated pictures were also submitted for
evaluation to students that were locked in low-biodiversity areas. From a research
perspective, the system enables the creation of large image databases by the students, similar
to citizen-science projects.
Beside the enhanced motivation of students to learn the vocabulary and perform
observations on self-found specimens, this system allows faculties to remotely follow and
assess the work performed by large numbers of students. The interface is freely available,
open-source and customizable. It can be used in other disciplines with adapted quests and
we expect it to be of interest in many classroom settings.

Teaching biology to ﬁrst-year bachelor students is a challenge. As educators,
our aim is usually twofold. First, we want the students to learn a new set of
knowledge and integrate it. Second, and this is for us equally important, we
want the students to engage with the topic at hand. We want to transmit our
passion and curiosity about the topic that we teach. Third, we also want
students to learn to observe the world around them. It is one thing to learn a
topic from a textbook, it is another to observe it in real life. However, the main
issue is that the classroom is, often by design, completely disconnected from
the natural world. The challenge is therefore to ﬁnd a way for students to
learn and engage with biology, despite that given disconnection. Last but not
least, in the Spring semester of 2020 (January to June) it was necessary for us
to adapt the learning activities to the containment measures related to
COVID-19.
The formal aim of our biology course - given in the Bioengineering Faculty,
UCLouvain, Belgium - is to discover plant and animal structures, organs and
their function at the individual scale. To achieve this, students need to learn
speciﬁc vocabulary related to these structures. The classic way to present this
vocabulary to a student audience is to review a series of slides illustrating
these different characteristics. This vocabulary is usually very boring for
teachers to describe (imagine the slides showing all the different shapes of
leaves) and the content is not very interesting for students to listen to either.
Yet this vocabulary is an important prerequisite for describing any biological
structure and for later systematic identiﬁcation of taxons using dichotomous
keys . Its learning is essential. The question is therefore how to make this
learning process motivating for the students and give them the opportunity to
learn over time instead of memorising a list of words? The additional difﬁculty
is that this learning activity must be able to be set up with more than 300
students and few teaching resources.
To create this learning activity, we decided to draw inspiration from all the
pedagogical techniques that aim to place the student at the centre of his
learning. Student-centred learning and active learning emerged as important
pedagogical techniques during the last century [REF]. Active learning is

characterised by (i) involving the student in the construction of his or her
learning, (ii) engaging the student in an in-depth treatment of the subject
matter, (iii) constructing learning through interaction (with the teacher or
other students), (iv) conceiving of learning as the evolution of knowledge and
skills [1,2]. Studies have shown that the more cognitively and socially
engaged the student is in a learning task, the more perennial the learning task
becomes [1,3]. Active learning improves the performance of students and acts
to reduce the gap achievement between advantaged and disadvantaged
students [4]. In order to stimulate learning through interaction and create a
collective emulation around this activity, the idea of creating a campus-wide
biological treasure hunt ﬁnally emerged from the discussions. Beyond simply
being active through the manipulation of information, the student has to
transform and produce new information that is not provided in the learning
material.
Gamiﬁcation is another recent technique to better engage the students in a
learning activity. Gamiﬁcation is deﬁned by [5] as “game-based mechanics,
aesthetics, and game thinking to engage people, motivate action, promote
learning, and solve problems”. In many studies, students’ levels of engagement
increased signiﬁcantly following the introduction of game elements, such as
points, challenges, quests or progress bar [6]. The gamiﬁed environnement
can afford intrinsic motivation and engagement, which are also targeted by
active learning.
To assemble these different elements - biological vocabulary, observation,
active learning and gamiﬁcation - in a comprehensive learning activity, we
created a large scale biological treasure hunt for our students. In short, we
provided students with a list of speciﬁc biological vocabulary. They had to
understand the list and ﬁnd the different elements outside of the classroom,
in the natural world. External resources (books, selected websites, wiki pages)
describing this vocabulary were available to them. Complexity of
understanding (some words are more difﬁcult than others) as well as the
difﬁculty of identiﬁcation in the ﬁeld were rewarded with different points.
To manage the treasure hunt, we designed a new web-based platform,
QuoVidi (which would loosely translate from latin as “where did you see”), for
the organisation of large scale, decentralised, biological treasure hunts.
QuoVidi is an open-source project available at www.quovidi.xyz. The objective
of this publication is to describe the project, to show how we were able to
adapt this learning activity to the covid-19 crisis, and ﬁnally, to show the
results and success of the activity with the students.

Presentation of QuoVidi

106

QuoVidi is a web application for the organisation and management of large
scale biological treasure hunts. It was created to teach students to learn new
biological terms (both in zoology and botany) and to teach them to observe
the natural world surrounding them.

Setting up the activity
First, educators have to prepare a list of quests to ﬁnd in the natural world.
These quests should be tailored and adapted for the target public. For
instance, in our experience with ﬁrst year biology students, the quests
revolved around biological structures and families (tab. 1). Each quest is given
a speciﬁc reward (points) depending on its intrinsic difﬁculty and rareness.
Quests can be sorted in different groups (for instance “animal” and “plant”)
and subgroups (for instance “animal species” and “leaf shapes”) to help
students navigate them.

Second, educators have to assign students to groups to perform the activity.
Students in the same group will be able to share pictures and collaborate on
the data collection. When logging into the web interface, students will be able
to see the collected pictures and rewards from their own group. They will also
be able to see the total number of points of the competing groups.

Educators also have the possibility to deﬁne speciﬁc game parameters, such
as speciﬁc geographic regions in which the game takes place or restriction on
the number of submissions in each quest group (adding for instance a point
penalty below a certain number of “animal” or “plant” submissions).
Once the list of quests, users and groups are deﬁned, the activity can start.
Two main activities are available for the students : an in situ treasure hunt and
an ex situ photo quiz activity.

The main activity of the platform is the biological treasure hunt. Students
have to go outside (although some of the creatures may be also found in their
home such as food parasites, e.g. Lepisma sp. or ﬂies) to ﬁnd the different
quests setup by the educators. Once they ﬁnd a speciﬁc quest, they have to
take a picture of it with their smartphone. We ask the student to take
unambiguous pictures, where the subject of the quest is clearly identiﬁed and
visible. We also ask them to leave the natural environment intact, without
killing any plant or animal in the process.
They can then store the picture on the QuoVidi web interface. When stored,
pictures are automatically resized (for efﬁciency) and added to the activity
database. Localisation information and date are extracted from the picture
EXIF metadata. Any other information is erased at this step.
Once pictures are stored on the web interface, students can assign them to a
speciﬁc quest and submit it for evaluation. The web application allows users
to follow their progress in detail (which picture was submitted for which
quest, what is the evaluation status, etc.) as well as the global progress of the
other groups (the total number of collected points).
It is worth noting that in Belgium - where the web application was ﬁrst used the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic still allowed citizens to go
outside for some walk and exercise, although at a limited range. As such, the
treasure hunt could still be performed by the students, either in their own
garden or in neighbouring areas. However, not everyone lives in the
countryside or close to a natural environment, or had the opportunity to leave
their home during the lockdown. This is why we created a second module in
the interface, the photo quiz, which allowed students to learn from photos
contributed by other students, without having to submit their own photos.

Photo quiz
The second module of the interface allows students to evaluate pictures
submitted by other students (a modiﬁed version of peer evaluation). More
precisely, in the photo quiz module, students are presented with pictures
submitted by other groups and validated by the educators (see below “Expert
evaluation). They have to assess whether the picture corresponds to its
assigned quests. Their assessment is then compared to the assessment of the
educators. If it matches, the students gain points that are added to their
global group tally.
When performing this activity for the ﬁrst time, it is necessary to have a
sufﬁcient amount of submitted (and corrected pictures). Without a database
large enough, the activity loses some of its interest, as students might all
review the same pictures.

The third important module of the interface, central to the activity, is the
expert evaluation. Each submitted picture needs to be manually assessed by
the educators. Different feedback can be given for each submission, such as
“correct”, “correct and nice picture”, “incorrect” , “not visible” (e.g. the object is
not visible in the picture) or “out of rules” (e.g. picture of a houseplant, picture
taken outside of the prescribed geographical zones). The interface was
designed to easily navigate the different quests and quickly correct the
submitted images.

Technical aspects of the web application
The web application was created using the R Shiny framework , using the
shinydashboard [7], shiny [8], shinyWidgets [9], shinyBS [10],
miniUI [11] packages for the user interface design. The data is stored in a
SQLite database, hosted on the server. The database management is done
using the DBI [12] and RSQLite [13] packages . Pictures are transformed
and managed using the magick [14] package. EXIF information is extracted
using the exifr [15] package. Data manipulation and visualisation is done
using the tidyverse [16], lubridate [17], cowplot [18],
formattable [19], DT [20], plyr [21], leaflet [22] packages. The text
sentiment analysis was performed using the rfeel package [23].

The web interface
The interface was created to be as much user-friendly as possible so that
neither students nor staff need technical training . Because it is web based, it
can be used on any platform, whatever the operating system . It scales on
mobile devices as well, allowing users to store and submit pictures directly
from the ﬁeld (if they have an internet connection).
Figure 1 shows the different panels of the web interface. Figure 1A shows the
“Store” panel, where students can store pictures, before submitting them for
evaluation. This allows students from the same group to share and visualise
their pictures. At this step, students can already assign a quest to the picture,
which can be changed later on. They can also assign a geographic region, if
this is required by the educators. A default region will be automatically
proposed, based on the metadata of the picture.
Figure 1B shows the “Submit” panel. At this stage, students see all the
pictures from their group. They can select a stored picture, assign it to a quest
and submit it for evaluation. Groups can only submit one picture for each
quest.
Figure 1C shows the “Bounty” panel, where students can visualise their
progress. The panel presents an overview of the activity progress (for
instance the total number of points or number of submitted quests). Students
can also see the status of individual submissions, whether they are submitted

or not as well as their validation status. In the same panel, students can also
see the global scores of each group taking part in the activity. This adds a
strong gamiﬁcation aspect to the activity.
Figure 1D shows the “Quests” panel. In that panel students can navigate
through the different quests proposed by the educators. They can sort them
by groups, subgroups or rewards. In this panel, no explanation is given for the
different quests. For instance if the quest is “Find an achene”, we do not deﬁne
achene. This is done by design. We want students to look up the different
biological terms by themselves. We do provide them with ressources to do so.

Figure 1 : Overview of the different panels of the web interface. A. Store panel, where students can load the
pictures taken in the ﬁeld into the interface. B. Submit panel, where students can see all the stored pictures
from their group and choose the ones to submit for evaluation. C. Bounty panel, where students can track the
progress of their group and the others, as well as the expert evaluation of their submitted images. D. Review
panel, where students can perform the photo quiz module.

When an educator logs into the web application, the “Quests'' panel becomes
the “Admin” panel. In this panel, educators can follow the evolution of the
activity (ﬁg. 2A), change the activity parameters (ﬁg. 2B) or correct the
student submissions (ﬁg 2C). Depending on the number of participating
students and allowed submissions, the number of corrections can quickly
become quite large. Therefore we designed the corrections interface to be
fast and efﬁcient. The educator ﬁrst chooses one quest to correct. He·She will

be presented with submissions for that quest only. The corrections are done
in one click, on the appropriate feedback button. Previously validated
submissions for this quest are presented on the side panel, to help maintain
the consistency of the evaluations. The validated pictures are also a useful
help for educators with a lesser expertise. Our experience shows that it takes,
on average, 5-10 seconds to evaluate one submission.

The 2020 activity

270

In Spring 2020, we organised the activity with a rooster of 346 ﬁrst year
bachelor students from the Bioengineering Faculty of the UCLouvain
(Belgium). Students were spread in 346 groups (it was therefore set up as an
individual activity). Although students had to do the activity individually, we
encouraged them to discuss the different quests and collect them together, as
long as everyone took their own pictures. Each group was allowed to submit a
maximum of 50 pictures. 285 quests were created, divided in 175 plant
quests and 110 animal quests.

272

Speciﬁc restrictions were added to the game. A minimal number of animal and
plant quests had to be collected by each group. Groups were also asked to

collect pictures in different zones and biotopes (tab. 2) around the University
campus, in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium).

274

The activity started on February 11. We had to pause the activity for 20 days
at the beginning of the lockdown due to the COVID19 crisis. During that
pause, we implemented the peer-evaluation in the web interface (it was not
part of the interface initially). The activity resumed on the 3d of April and
ﬁnished on the 15th of May. For the second phase of the activity, during the
lockdown, all restrictions (quests groups and zones) were lifted as many
students had returned to their home far away from the campus.

At the end of the activity, we sent an anonymous feedback form to the

Before the lockdown, as we asked students to take pictures around the
university, most of them were taken in Louvain-la-Neuve. During the
lockdown, almost no pictures were taken in Louvain-la-Neuve, as students
went back home. The lockdown reduced the number of collected pictures, but
did not stop it. This is due to several reasons. At the beginning of the activity,
we encouraged students to look for quests in groups, to foster peer-learning
between them. This was not possible anymore during the lockdown. The
collection of biological data was also inﬂuenced by the direct surroundings of
the students. Students living in an urban area were potentially at a
disadvantage compared to students in the countryside.

However, because we included the photo quiz module at the beginning of the
lockdown, every student could continue the activity. Figure 4 shows, for every
group, the proportion of points acquired either with the quests collection or
the photo quiz. We can see that the dual system allowed students to choose
different strategies, to adapt to their individual lockdown conditions.

We also observed a strong trend toward the collection of plant-related quests
by the students (ﬁg. 3C & D). This is probably due to the fact that, in an urban
setup, plants are easier to ﬁnd that animals. For an inexperienced naturalist, it
is also probably easier to take pictures of plants than animals that have a
tendency to escape. All the pictures can be viewed interactively at the address
http://2020.quovidi.xyz

Student accuracy
Overall, we observed a high correctness in the students picture submissions
(ﬁg 5A). For the treasure hunt and the picture collection, only 10% and 14%
of the quests (for the animal and plant, respectively) were assessed as
incorrect by ourselves. One reason for such a high accuracy from the students
might be the high level of engagement required by the activity. They have to
learn the vocabulary and discuss with other students, and go outside often in
groups to ﬁnd what they have identiﬁed as appropriate for a quest
submission. In the ICAP framework [3], we believe this corresponds to the
“Interactive learning” level, enabling the highest learning capabilities.
Interestingly, we also observed a much lower accuracy for the photo quiz (ﬁg.
5B). For that activity, 37% and 38% of the evaluations by the students (for

the animal and plant, respectively) were incorrect. This can be due to several
factors. First, contrary to the treasure hunt in itself, the evaluation activity
requires a lesser level of engagement by the student. The activity is indeed
“reduced” to click on a button in front of a computer screen. Second,
depending on the quality of the picture to evaluate, said evaluation could be
challenging. We tried to keep only good pictures for that activity, but the
quality remained nonetheless variable.

each type, the proportion of correct and false submissions / corrections

Students feedback
Overall, the activity was very well appreciated by the students. With a few
exceptions, students like going outside to observe their surroundings and
collect the quests. In a survey performed after the activity (ﬁg. 6), 125
students reported to like the activity and have the feeling to have learned
during it. Many students spontaneously expressed their enthusiasm for this
activity (tab. 3).

Selected comments from the students
“Great activity to learn new concepts and look at our environment in a different way.”
“I think the game is fun and interactive, it's a great way to learn by seeing things "in real life" and
also to decipher the quests.”
“Very nice way to propose the course, it pushes the students to discover the surrounding nature
in a playful way.”

Remote learning through a centralised game
The QuoVidi platform was created for several reasons. We wanted students
to learn and know speciﬁc plant and animal vocabulary, but we did not want to
just give them a list of words to be memorized and repeated. We also wanted
them to explore and learn to observe their direct environment. We wanted to
show them that you do not need to go to a tropical forest to be able to see a
great diversity of plant and animal forms and species. We wanted to spark a

strong interest in their surrounding natural world. Finally, we were also
working with strong practical constraints. We needed to design an activity
that was scalable for hundreds of students, without the need to increase the
number of educators. This was possible, thanks to the current technologies
(camera, mobile network and GPS localisation) available in almost every
mobile phone.
With the creation of the web-platform for QuoVidi, we have met all those
goals. The treasure hunt (and to a lesser extent the photo quiz) strongly
motivates students to learn and remember the different technical terms used
in the quests. Then they have to apply these new terms directly in the ﬁeld.
The gamiﬁcation process (quests, score points, personal progress panel and
scoreboard between all the groups) is also a strong incentive to engage in the
activity.
The activity is also highly scalable. The number of participants is, from a
technical point of view, only limited by the capacity of the server on which the
platform is installed. The main limitation remains the expert correction step.
As every single picture needs to be validated, the evaluation can quickly
require a lot of time from the educator, even though we tried to make the
process as efﬁcient as possible. We hope in the future that the platform
would beneﬁt from advances in artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to help
correct the images (see below).
Finally, the activity is completely decentralised, which has been a great asset
during the COVID-19 crisis. Students can collect quests at any time and place,
making it easy to adapt to every individual situation. If they cannot go outside,
or are not in a nature-rich environment, they can still participate in the
activity via the peer evaluation module. From the educator point of view, all
the management and corrections can be done from anywhere, as long as they
have access to a computer and an internet connection. As such, the platform
was a real asset during the lockdown period (13 March to 8 of June in
Belgium), as it enabled us to continue the activity almost seamlessly.

Reusing the image database
390

Similarly to citizen science projects, the use of our platform allows the
collection of large numbers of geotagged, dated images of plant and animal
structures. By helping create such a database over the years, the students are
taking an active role in creating a valuable research ressource. This in itself is
viewed by the students as a motivational element of the activity.

Such databases could be re-used in different ways. From an educational point
of view, the images collected could be used to create a quiz to rehearse the
vocabulary the following year. The student would therefore create their own
teaching and rehearsal material. An example of a quiz created with the
students pictures is visible here : http://quiz.quovidi.xyz .
From a research point of view, an ever growing database of annotated plant
and animal pictures (describing either organ, species or groups), on a limited
and well deﬁned area would be a valuable resource. As each record of the
database has been validated by an expert (the educators), such a database
could be used in research projects.
Another interesting valuation of the database would be to reuse it to train
deep learning recognition algorithms. Again, given the size and potential
growth of the database, it will be an interesting resource to train machine
learning models to recognise plant and animal structures. Such models could,
in turn, be integrated into the platform to help with the correction.

Collaborations between groups
So far, we use the QuoVidi framework within a single classroom (even if it was
a very large one). Since the activity is entirely centralised online, we could
imagine collaboration between remote classrooms. Students from different
regions, countries or continents could participate in the same activity, hence
increasing the degree of diversity of the observations.

Expanding to new disciplines
Here we exempliﬁed the use of our platform with a biological treasure hunt.
Students were asked to ﬁnd, in the ﬁeld, plant and animal structures.
However, due to its ﬂexibility, the platform could be used to organise large
scale treasure hunts in any context.
It could be used in architecture, design or geology classrooms, with quests
related to different building structures, street art or rock, respectively. It
could be used with children, with simpliﬁed quests, or with more advanced
students, with more complex ones. In short, we expect the concept could be
used in any context to deal with structures present in the “outside” world.

Conclusions
We presented in this manuscript a new open-source web platform for the
organisation for large tresor hunt, QuoVidi.
During the Spring 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, we successfully
used the QuoVidi platform with more than 300 students, and allowed the
collection of more than 6000 geotagged plant and animal pictures. The
decentralised nature of the platform enabled us to ensure a continuity in our
teaching, despite the nation-wide lockdown.
We expect QuoVidi to be of interest for any teaching activity focused on the
identiﬁcation of real-world structures. QuoVidi is available at the address
http://www.quovidi.xyz
