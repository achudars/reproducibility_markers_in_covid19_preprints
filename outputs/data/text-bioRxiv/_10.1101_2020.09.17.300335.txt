Abstract
The yeast ​Pichia pastoris is a cost-effective and easily scalable system for recombinant
protein production. In this work we compared the conformation of the receptor
binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressed in ​P. pastoris and in
the well established HEK-293T mammalian cell system. RBD obtained from both yeast
and mammalian cells was properly folded, as indicated by UV-absorption, circular
dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence. They also had similar stability, as indicated by
temperature-induced unfolding (observed ​T​m were 50 °C and 52 °C for RBD produced in
P. pastoris and HEK-293T cells, respectively). Moreover, the stability of both variants
was similarly reduced when the ionic strength was increased, in agreement with a
computational analysis predicting that a set of ionic interactions may stabilize RBD
structure. Further characterization by HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography and mass
spectrometry revealed a higher heterogeneity of RBD expressed in ​P. pastoris relative
to that produced in HEK-293T cells, which disappeared after enzymatic removal of
glycans. The production of RBD in ​P. pastoris was scaled-up in a bioreactor, with yields
above 45 mg/L of 90% pure protein, thus potentially allowing large scale immunizations
to produce neutralizing antibodies, as well as the large scale production of serological
tests for SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak was first recognized in December 2019 in Wuhan,
China​1​. Since then, this virus has spread to all parts of the world, resulting in a total of
29415168 infected individuals and 931934 deaths by September 14​th​, 2020

(​https://www.coronatracker.com​). The causative agent is a coronavirus that causes a
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV)
has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses​2 that
have four open reading frames (ORFs) for structural proteins -Spike, Envelope,
Membrane, and Nucleocapsid-​3,4​, from which Spike is the primary determinant of CoVs
tropism. Spike mediates the viral and cellular membrane fusion by binding mainly to
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE​5,6​.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome has 29903 nucleotides in length​7​, sharing 79% and
50% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV genomes, respectively​8​.
Genetic studies suggest that both viruses originated from bat CoVs​8,9​, with civet cats as
intermediate hosts in the case of SARS-CoV-1​10​, and pangolins in the case of
SARS-CoV-2​11,12​. Among the structural proteins, the Envelope protein has the highest
sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 (96% identity), while the
Spike protein, responsible for the interaction with the host receptor, the largest
sequence divergence (76% identity with SARS-CoV-1)​13​. It has been suggested that the
divergence of Spike could be related to an increased immune pressure​1​. Consistently
with the proposed role of pangolins as SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts, CoVs from
pangolins share the highest genetic similarity with this virus in the region encoding the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein​11,14​.
Due to its important role for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell, Spike is the
most studied protein of this virus. This transmembrane glycosylated protein is
composed of 1273 amino acid assemblies as a homotrimer that forms spikes that
protrude from the virus envelope. Spike has two domains, named S1 and S2 . Residues

319-591 from S1 correspond to the RBD, responsible for the interaction with ACE2​15​.
RBD binds with high affinity to the ACE2, located on the outer surface of the cell
membrane, which acts as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor since it mediates the fusion of the
virus to the cell membrane​16​. Spike also includes a transmembrane domain and a fusion
peptide​17​.
Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that internal motions of the Spike
trimer are important to expose the RBD domain so it can interact with the target
receptor. However, part of the time RBD domain is hidden within the rest of the Spike
protein, and this process is mediated by protein motions of high amplitude. The
structure of RBD-ACE2 protein complex and the structure of Spike (as the full-length
and trimeric form of the protein) were determined by X-ray crystallography and
cryo-EM​16,18–20​.
RBD is a protein domain of 220 residues, it has nine cysteine residues (eight of
them forming disulfide bonds) (​Figure 1​) and two ​N-g​ lycosylation sites (N331 and
N343). The addition of glycan moieties might have a relevant role on the ​in vivo protein
folding process, on the dynamics, stability and solvent accessibility of RBD and also on
its immunogenicity​21,22​. RBD is not a globular protein domain; it has a central twisted
antiparallel beta-sheet formed by five strands decorated with secondary structure
elements (short helices and strands) and loops​19​. The secondary structure analysis of
the protein shows 12.4% helix, 33.0% sheet, 19.1% turn, and 35.6% coil.

Figure 1. Structure of Sars-Cov-2 Receptor Binding Domain bound to ACE2. ​The
secondary structure elements of RBD are differentially colored (Alpha helices: purple,
3_10 helices: iceblue, beta strands: yellow, and turns/coil: cyan). Disulfide bridges (red)
and tryptophan residues (blue) are shown as sticks, while N-glycosylation asparagine
residues (green) are shown as VDW spheres. The region of ACE2 encompassing
residues 1-115 (colored white) which interacts with RBD is also shown. The structure
was generated using PDB structures 6xm0 and 6m0j.
Despite its medium size of 25 kDa, RBD is an example of a challenging protein
domain to express in heterologous systems due to its complex topology (Figure 1).
Nevertheless, it is of high importance to produce and purify RBD at low-cost and
efficiently, since this domain is extensively used for the development of serological test
kits as well as an immunogen, both for the production of animal immune sera and for
vaccine development​23​. While ​E. coli is a cost-efficient system for the expression of
many proteins, it is unlikely to be the case for RBD due to its requirement of disulfide
bond formation and glycosylation for its proper expression and folding. For this reason,
RBD is usually expressed in mammalian as well as insect cells​24​,​18​.
The methylotrophic yeast ​Pichia pastoris is an alternative cost-effective
eukaryotic system that allows relatively easy scaling-up of recombinant protein
production, and which has previously been used for the expression of SARS-CoV-1 RBD

to produce a vaccine​25​. This yeast can use methanol as an exclusive carbon source. This
molecule is also an inductor of the strong and tightly regulated AOX1 promoter​26​,
which can therefore be used to drive recombinant protein expression. When cultured
in bioreactors, ​P. pastoris can reach high cell densities, and more importantly, this
organism allows the efficient secretion of recombinant proteins to the culture medium,
which contains relatively low levels of endogenous proteins, thus allowing the
straightforward purification of recombinant secretory proteins​26​.
In this work we expressed and purified SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD from two
different systems -the yeast ​P. pastoris and mammalian cells- and compared their
structure, stability, glycosylation status, and immunogenicity in mice. Our work
provides useful insights on the production of a key protein used in diagnosis and
therapeutics to fight COVID-19 pandemia.

substitutions or InDels), 1.4% (925/64707) have more than 80% (up to 44 amino acid
substitutions or InDels) and only 300 genomes have a lower amino acid identity relative
to the first published sequence. Thus, we considered appropriate to express the
predominant RBD form, spanning from residue 319 to 537 of Spike protein, which
consists of a relatively compact domain, and includes a slightly disordered C-terminal
stretch useful for protein engineering (​Figure 1​).

Expression of RBD in mammalian and yeast cells
The expression of RBD in mammalian cells (HEK-293T cell line) and in ​P. pastoris
yielded significant quantities of protein (∼5 and 10-13 mg L​-1 of cell culture,
respectively, at a laboratory scale). In both cases, the recombinant protein was fused to
appropriate secretion signal peptides, IL2 export signal peptide for HEK-293T
expression and ​Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion signal for ​P. pastoris
expression. Both secretion signals allowed the recovery of mature RBD from cell
culture supernatants.
Since RBD expressed in both eukaryotic systems included a C- terminal His tag,
similar purification protocols were used in both cases. However, given that the
physico-chemical conditions required for optimal growth of mammalian and yeast cells
were completely different (HEK-293T cells were grown at 37 o​​ C in a medium buffered
to pH 7.4, while ​P. pastoris were grown at 28 o​​ C, buffered to pH 6.0), the covalent
structure, intactness, conformation, post translational modifications and stability of
RBD might still differ depending on the expression system used. Additionally, both
strategies involved the accumulation of soluble RBD in the supernatant, which can pose
an extra challenge for unstable proteins. For these reasons, it was crucial to evaluate

parameters such as protein aggregation, oxidation, and possible alterations in disulfide
bond patterns of proteins obtained from the different media.
NTA-Ni​2+​-purified RBD from both HEK-293T and yeast exhibited high purity
(>90%), as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (​Figure 2A​). RBD from HEK-293T cells migrated
as a 35 KDa single-smear band in SDS-PAGE 12%, while RBD produced in ​P. pastoris
migrated as one highly diffuse and more abundant band of ∼45-40 kDa, and a less
abundant band of ∼35 kDa, the latter similar to that of RBD produced in HEK-293T cells.
HPLC profile analysis revealed that RBD produced in HEK-293T cells is highly
homogeneous, as shown by its elution as a sharp peak at 48-49 % of acetonitrile in a
reverse phase C18 column, while RBD produced in ​P. pastoris showed a considerably
broader peak, although it eluted at very similar acetonitrile concentration. In addition,
two very small peaks appeared in the chromatogram of RBD produced in ​P. pastoris​.
The area corresponding to the full-length protein was approximately 87%.
The SDS-PAGE analysis of RBD purified from yeast and mammalian cell culture
supernatants suggested the existence of glycosylation as the main post-traslational
modification in RBD, as its theoretical mass (deduced from the amino acid sequence) is
∼26 kDa (​Figure 2​), while both recombinant RBD forms migrated as products of more
than 32-35 kDa. This was expected, since two ​N​-glycosylation consensus sequences
(NIT and NAT) are present at RBD N-terminal region. RBD from SARS-CoV-1 also bears
three glycosylation sites at its N-terminal region, and was found to be glycosylated​25​.

band of ∼25-26 kDa, compatible with the predicted MW of deglycosylated RBD (26.5
kDa, ​Figure 3​). The decrease in the molecular mass of RBD by endoglycanase digestion
confirmed the existence of ​N-​ glycosylations in both proteins. Moreover, glycans from

​ BD - and not from HEK-293T-RBD - were also removed by EndoH, an
P. pastoris-R
endoglycanase that eliminates only high-mannose type glycans, which are the expected
type in ​P. pastoris yeasts. These results strongly suggest that RBD from mammalian
cells bears only complex or hybrid glycans, while RBD from ​P. pastoris only bears high
mannose glycans. Moreover, the persistence of two bands in RBD from HEK-293T cells

available from the Peptide Atlas database​30 for peptides identified from SARS-CoV-2. To

were very similar; they are dominated by a high content of tyrosine residues (16 Tyr, 2

aggregates (​Figure 5​). However, freezing and thawing resulted in protein precipitation
when RBD concentration was higher than 80 μM (data not shown).
The fourth derivative of absorption spectra can be used to evaluate RBD native
conformation. Spectra corresponding to RBD produced in HEK-293T cells and ​P.
pastoris were superimposable (​Figures 6B and C​), suggesting a similar packing of the
aromatic residues. In particular, the positive band at 290.4 nm corresponding to Trp
residues observed in the native state of RBD (​Figure 6C​) showed a significant red shift
compared to the 288 nm band of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA), suggesting that
Trp residues in RBD are not fully exposed to the solvent (​Figure 6B​). Also the negative
band at 287.8 nm (a contribution of Tyr and Trp residues) showed a significant red shift
compared to that observed for the fully exposed NATA and N-acetyl-L-tyrosinamide,
NAYA. Similarly, a band corresponding to Tyr (280.4 nm) showed a shift to 279 nm
(NAYA).

Hydrodynamic behavior of RBD forms analyzed by SEC-HPLC
SEC-HPLC experiments of RBD produced in ​P. pastoris confirmed the absence of
aggregated forms and showed a peak compatible with two species between 45-25 kDa
(​Figure 6​). Deconvolution of the chromatogram in two components by fitting to two
gaussian curve suggested that ∼60% of the signal comes from a higher molecular
weight component (>40 kDa), whereas the rest of the signal ∼40% corresponds to a
lower molecular weight component (<30 kDa). It is worth mentioning that the
exclusion profile corresponding to RBD produced in HEK-293T cells superimposes with
the latter, suggesting a more homogeneous glycosylation of the protein.

Conformational characterization of RBD forms analyzed by c​ ircular dichroism​,
fluorescence and thermal-induced unfolding
RBD produced in mammalian and ​P. pastoris cells showed superimposable
far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra (​Figure 7A​), suggesting a similar secondary
structure. Moreover, the CD spectra are identical to that observed for RBD from
SARS-CoV-1 produced in yeast​25​. However, given the particular shapes of the ​P. pastoris
and HEK-293T SARS-CoV-2 RBD far-UV CD spectra (which show a single minimum at
206 nm and a maximum at 230 nm, the latter suggesting the contribution of aromatic
residues to the spectra), it is difficult to estimate the secondary structure content by
using standard sets of spectra.
We further studied the conformation of RBD produced in HEK-293T cells or P.
pastoris by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectra corresponding to the native
forms of RBD superimposed very well, suggesting that these aromatic residues are
located in similar, apolar environments, as inferred by the maximal emission
wavelengths observed (337 nm) (​Figure 8B​). The addition of 4.0 M GdmCl resulted in a
red shift to 353-354 nm, a result compatible with the exposure of the aromatic side
chains to the solvent, and the total unfolding of the protein forms. Interestingly,
unfolding of RBD produced in ​P. pastoris showed reversibility when 4.0 M GdmCl was
diluted to 0.7 or 1.0 M, as judged by the blue shift from 353 to 337 nm and form 353 to

342 nm, respectively. No reducing agents (​e.g. DTT, 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to
the protein sample, indicating that the dimension of the conformational space
corresponding to the unfolded state of RBD was constrained by the native disulfide
bonds.

different ionic strength conditions (75, 150, 300 and 500 mM NaCl) was followed by
Sypro-orange fluorescence.

The conformational stability of different RBD forms was studied through
temperature unfolding experiments. Unfolding was monitored by fluorescence of
Sypro-orange, an extrinsic probe that preferentially binds to proteins when they are in
unfolded conformations. In these experiments, the observed ​Tm​ usually correlates with
T​m obtained from differential scanning calorimetry experiments​33​. RBD produced in ​P.
pastoris consistently showed a slightly lower ​T​m value relative to that of RBD from
HEK-293T cells (in all assessed conditions), an observation compatible with a reduced
resistance to temperature-induced denaturation, which likely reflects a marginally
lower conformational stability of RBD produced in ​P. pastoris (​Figure 7C​). When the
unfolding process was studied at different ionic strengths, a significant increase in ​T​m
was observed when NaCl concentration was reduced from 500 to 75 mM (​Figure 7C​),
suggesting that the tertiary structure of RBD is stabilized by ionic pair interactions.

Computational analysis of RBD structure
The dependence of the observed ​T​m on the NaCl concentrations, led us to
hypothesize that increasing the ionic strength destabilizes RBD conformation by
shielding key charged residues. Although the RBD structure suggests some energetic

frustration, given that there are several clusters of positively charged residues on RBD
surface ((1) R136, R139 and K140; (2) K126, R28, R191; (3) R37, K38, R39 and R148; (4)
R85, R90 and K99)​19​, our results suggest that these repulsive interactions are most
likely compensated even in the context of the isolated RBD domain (​i.e. ​without the
rest of Spike or the ACE2 receptor). This would explain why increasing ionic strength
has a major destabilizing effect.
The RBD crystallographic structure analysis indicates that residues have a
particular distribution according to their type. The core subdomain (residues 333-442
and 504-526 on the Spike protein) is enriched in non-polar residues, whereas the
receptor-binding motif (RBM) subdomain (residues 443-503) is enriched in polar ones.
On the other hand, the charged residues are preferentially located close to the
interface between the Core and RBM subdomains and form an electrostatic network
(​Figure 8​).

Among the 14 positively and negatively charged residue pairs interacting at a distance
lower than 6 Å, 8 are in the core subdomain, 5 in the RBM, and 1 pair is between the
Core and RBM subdomains (​Table 3​). The existence of 6 ionic pair interactions involving
at least one occluded charged residue (D398, E406, D442, R454, D467, and R509) is also
remarkable.

Immune Response elicited by RBD produced in P. pastoris in mice

With the aim of evaluating the ability of the RBD protein produced in ​P. pastoris
to stimulate immune response we assessed antibody production in mice by an ELISA
assay using plates coated with RBD produced either in HEK-293T or in ​P. pastoris.​ After
a first dose of antigen plus adjuvants, mice presented higher antibody titers than
controls, and after a second dose, the levels of antibodies increased significantly in a
short period of time (20 days) relative to the first dose (​Figure 9A​). No significant
differences in antibody titers were observed between plates coated with RBD from ​P.
pastoris or from HEK-293T cells. Thus, immunization of mice with RBD produced in ​P.
pastoris plus adjuvant induces a high level of specific IgG class antibodies. Next,
Western blots were performed in which RBD produced either in ​P. pastoris or in
HEK-293T cells was detected with a serum from mice immunized with RBD produced in
HEK-293T cells (kindly provided by Dr. Juan Ugalde, University of San Martín, ​Figure 9B,

produced in ​P. pastoris (​ ​Figure 9B, middle​), or a primary antibody against the His tag
present in both RBD recombinant proteins (​Figure 9B, right​). Similar bands were
observed in all three blots.

Production of RBD by fermentation in bioreactor

The fermentation of ​P. pastoris in a 7 L stirred-tank bioreactor for the production of
recombinant RBD ​was carried out using a four-phase procedure described in Methods.
In the batch phase, cell concentration reached a maximum level of 15.7 g DCW/L after
18 h of cultivation (​Figure 10​). At this stage, ​P. pastoris exhibited a maximum specific
growth rate (​μ​max​) of 0.21 h​-1 and a biomass yield coefficient (​Y​x/s​) of 0.39 g DCW/g of
glycerol. After a spike of dissolved oxygen, the glycerol fed-batch phase was initiated by
regulating the feeding in response to the level of dissolved oxygen (DO %). Glycerol
feeding was maintained for 22 h, when biomass concentration reached a value of 60.4
g DCW/L. After glycerol feeding was stopped, the transition stage was performed by
feeding with a glycerol (600 g/L):methanol (3:1) mixture for 5 h, to allow a slow cell
adaptation for the efficient utilization of methanol. At the end of this stage the biomass
level reached 63.2 g DCW/L. Next, the methanol fed-batch phase was initiated to
induce recombinant RBD expression, through regulation of pure methanol feeding
according to DO %. After 48 h of methanol induction and a total fermentation time of
93 h, the culture reached a biomass concentration of 75.3 g DCW/L, which produced a
final RBD yield of 45.0 mg/L (>90% pure). Beyond that time point there was no
significant change in cell concentration and antigen expression level (data not shown).
At the end of the fermentation, a final volume of 5.5 liters of culture was reached, so
that the total amount of RBD obtained was 247.5 mg, the volumetric productivity was
0.48 mg/L​ ​h, and the total productivity 2.66 mg/h.

Discussion
This work materialized the first two goals of our consortium assembled to fight
COVID-19 pandemia: (a) to express and characterize RBD from SARS-CoV-2, and (b) to
produce RBD at low cost with high yield. We were able to express this protein in two
different systems: ​P. pastoris a​ nd mammalian cells (HEK-293T), which allowed us to
gain useful insights concerning RBD conformation and stability.
We attempted to express RBD in ​E. coli​, even though an examination of its
structure suggested that this system would not be suited for its expression due to the
existence of 4 disulfide bonds and a non-globular shape. The ​E. coli SHuffle expression
system only yielded insoluble RBD (in inclusion bodies) as expected, which was not
further characterized as it was unsuitable for downstream applications (data not
shown). In agreement with our results, in a previous attempt to express the similar RBD

from SARS-CoV-1 Spike in ​E. coli,​ this protein was also found in the insoluble fraction,
and neither its fusion to thioredoxin, nor to maltose-binding protein, increased its
solubility. Moreover, while tagging the protein with glutathione ​S-​ transferase (GST)
increased its solubility​34​, it remained strongly bound to the bacterial chaperone GroEL
even after affinity purification​35​, thus making it unsuitable for downstream
applications.
By contrast, RBD expression in HEK-293T and ​P. pastoris e​ ukaryotic cells
produced soluble and properly folded polypeptides. Their UV-absorption, CD and
Trp-fluorescence spectra showed high similarity with those previously described for

SARS-CoV-1 RBD produced in ​P. pastoris25​
was also characterized by controlled proteolysis and mass spectrometry analysis.
Remarkably, the peptide of sequence FPNITNLCPFGEVFNATR was not easily detected
by mass spectrometry. A plausible and straightforward explanation for this result is
that glycosylation of this peptide at positions N331 (NIT) and N343 (NAT) increases its
mass, and thus takes the peptide out of the range of mass analysis. The sequence
coverage corresponding to a similar N-terminal peptide of RBD produced in HEK-293T
cells was also lower than expected as the peptide VQPTESIVR was not detected, which
might be due to the presence of ​O-​ glycosylations in this stretch.
Proteins translocated to the ER are ​N​-glycosylated cotranslationally, and exactly
the same glycan Glc​3​Man​9​GlcNAc​2 is transferred to the N residue in the consensus
sequence NXS/T (where X cannot be P) of mammalian, plant and yeast proteins. Glc
residues are immediately removed in the ER, where glycans play a key role in the
solubility of the glycoproteins and in the so-called “quality control of glycoprotein
folding”​36​. Cycles of glucosylation and deglucosylation occur in the endoplasmic

reticulum (ER) until the glycoprotein is folded and continues the transit through the
secretory pathway or, if unable to fold properly, is retrotranslocated to the cytosol and
degraded by the proteasomes. This mechanism guarantees that only properly folded
proteins are secreted. Once glycoproteins leave the ER, ​N​-glycans are remodeled in the
transit through the golgi apparatus and acquire glycan structures that are species
specific. In yeast ​N​-glycans in mature proteins are of high mannose type while in
mammalian proteins are of complex or hybrid type​37​. ​O​-glycosylation of S or T residues
may also occur in the Golgi, but in this case the monosaccharides are added step by
step, and are species specific. When RBD purified from ​P. pastoris and HEK-293T cells
were treated with PNGaseF, which removes both high mannose and complex
N-​ glycans, a similar band of ∼26 KDa was observed by SDS-PAGE for both proteins, in
agreement with the expected molecular weight of the proteins lacking ​N-​ glycans.
However, only in the case of RBD obtained from ​P. pastoris the same band was
observed when proteins were treated with EndoH, which removes high mannose
glycans, indicating that RBD from ​P. pastoris bears only the expected high mannose
N-​ glycans, while RBD from HEK-293T likely bears complex or hybrid ones. It has been
previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 RBD is produced as two predominantly
N-​ glycosylated forms of∼34 and ∼27 kDa when expressed in Sf9 insect cells​23​.
Exhaustive removal of ​N​-glycans RBD obtained from HEK-293T cells produced
two protein forms that migrated as distinct bands, suggesting the presence of either
two ​O-​ glycosylated isoforms, or of two peptide isoforms. Shajahan and coworkers have
evaluated the ​O​-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein produced in HEK-293 cells
by searching LC-MS/MS data for common ​O-​ glycosylation modifications. These authors

found ​O​-glycosylation sites at positions T323 and S325, which provides further support
to our suggestion​37​.
For secretory recombinant proteins produced in yeast, high mannose
hyperglycosylation may be a major issue, as it may potentially alter functional
properties of the proteins​26​. However, even though RBD expressed in HEK-293T and ​P.
pastoris exhibited different glycosylation patterns, both conformational and stability
studies carried out in the present work suggest that both polypeptides have similar
structures. The stability of both forms was similarly sensitive to changes in ionic
strength, a result in good agreement with our computational modelling, which predicts
that a set of ionic interactions stabilizes RBD structure and most likely modulates its
internal motions. Interestingly, when RBD was unfolded in the absence of reducing
agents the process was reversible, as judged by the analysis of Trp fluorescence
spectra, which suggests that Trp residue emission occurs in an apolar and likely more
rigid environment upon refolding.
Previously, the thermal stability of a mutated version of RBD from SARS-CoV-1
Spike named RBD219-N1 (residues 319-536 from Spike, where the first Asn of RBD,
residue 318, was deleted to avoid glycosylation at the N-terminal region of the protein)
was analyzed by thermal shift monitoring of extrinsic fluorescence​38​. Remarkably, the
RBD219-N1 denaturation profile showed an average melting temperature of
approximately 57 o​​ C, a value significantly higher than that observed for RBD from
SARS-CoV-2 in this work (approximately 50 o​​ C), which might be due to the fact that
denaturation of RBD219-N1 was carried out at a considerably lower ionic strength​38​. In
addition, the pH of the protein sample was not constant throughout the experiment,
given that the p​K​a of the Tris buffer used in this work is highly temperature dependent.

Alternatively, the suppression of the N-terminal glycosylation in SARS-CoV-1 RBD might
have an effect on its conformational stability. Nevertheless, the possibility that
SARS-CoV-1 RBD has particular features that might increase its stability relative to that
of SARS-CoV-2 RBD should not be excluded.
In our hands, RBD in its native state was stable under a broad range of pH and
concentrations. Although it exhibited a low tendency to aggregate at high
concentrations, no significant complications were observed during filter-protein
concentration or dialysis, which was performed either to change the buffer or to
remove imidazole after protein purification. Freezing (-80 o​​ C) and subsequent thawing
of RBD did not result in protein aggregation at protein concentrations of 30-40 𝜇M or
lower, therefore this strategy was used for its storage, as it made unnecessary the use
of stabilizing molecules such as glycerol or trehalose. However, it should be noted that
RBD precipitation was occasionally observed after thawing, at protein concentrations
above 80 𝜇M.
P. pastoris​-produced RBD was able to stimulate antibody production in mice,
and the resulting immune sera were capable of detecting RBD produced not only in ​P.
pastoris but also in HEK-293T cells. Finally, scaling up of RBD expression in ​P. pastoris
could be performed in a bioreactor with yields greater than 45 mg L​-1​, which potentially
allows the large scale immunization of animals in order to produce neutralizing
antibodies, or the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Future biotechnological
developments will be facilitated by the inclusion of a Sortase-A enzyme recognition site
within the RBD coding sequence, which allows the native covalent coupling of RBD to
fluorescent probes, peptides, proteins, or modified surfaces, through an efficient
transpeptidation reaction​39​. Thus, the Sortase-A-mediated transpeptidation will allow

Methods
Expression of RBD in mammalian cells
For RBD expression in mammalian cells, a DNA fragment optimized for
expression in human cells encoding RBD (Spike residues from 319 to 537, preceded by
the IL-2 export sequence (MYRMQLLSCIALSLALVTNS) and followed by a C-terminal
Sortase-A recognition sequence for covalent coupling​39 and a His6 tag for purification
(LPETGHHHHHH) was synthesized by GenScript (NJ, USA) and cloned into the
pCDNA3.1(+) plasmid vector (ampicillin R). Expression of RBD was carried out in the
HEK-293T cell line kindly provided by Xavier Saelens (VIB-University of Ghent, Belgium).
HEK-293T cells were grown in high glucose (4.5 g L​-1 glucose) Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Natocor), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units mL​-1 and 100 µg mL​-1
respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 110 mg L​-1 of sodium pyruvate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) in a 37°C humidified incubator containing 5% CO​2​. Cells were plated (2
x 10​7 cells per 150 mm plate) and grown for 24 h before transfection with
Polyethylenimine (PEI, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were
grown for 72h before harvesting the culture medium.
Mammalian cell culture medium was centrifuged twice at 12,0000xg for 20 min
at 4 o​​ C, later the supernatant pH was adjusted to 8.0 with equilibration buffer (50 mM
sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8,0). RBD was purified
using a previously equilibrated Ni​2+​-NTA-agarose column. RBD was eluted by increasing

concentrations of imidazole prepared in the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing
the recombinant protein, as judged by the SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and
dialyzed against a buffer without imidazole (20 mM Sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl,
pH= 7,4).
Expression of RBD in Pichia pastoris
The RBD coding sequence with codon optimization for ​P. pastoris (Spike amino
acid residues 319-537) fused to the ​Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha factor secretion
signal (N-terminal)​40 followed by a C-terminal Sortase-A recognition sequence and a
His6 tag (C-terminal) was synthesized and cloned into pPICZalpha by GenScript (NJ,
USA) using EcoRI and SacII restriction sites to produce pPICZalphaA-RBD-Hisx6.
The SacI linearized pPICZalphaA-RBD-Hisx6 vector (10 𝜇g) was used to transform
electrocompetent X-33 ​P. pastoris strain at 2.5 kV, 25 uF, 200 ohm. Cells recovered in
ice-cold 1.0 M sorbitol (Sigma) were plated in YPDS (YPD: 1% yeast extract, 2%
bactopeptone (Difco), 2% glucose, plus 1.0 M sorbitol) supplemented with 100 μg mL​-1
zeocin (Invitrogen) and incubated four days at 28 o​​ C. Selected colonies (45) were
transferred to increasing amounts of zeocin (100 to 500 μg mL​-1​). The integration at
AOX site in clones that were resistant to the highest amount of zeocin was confirmed
by colony PCR using primers AOX​for (5´-GACTGGTTCCAATTGACAAGC-3’) and RBD​rev (5'
GTTCCATGCAATGACGCATC 3').
For RBD production in batch, ​single colonies were used to inoculate BMGY
medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 1.34% YNB, 400 μgL​-1 biotin, 0.1 M
potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 1% glycerol) and cultures were grown at 28 o​​ C with
agitation at 250 rpm until the culture reached a OD​600nm​= 4-6. Cells were harvested,

o​

C with shaking at 250 rpm in flasks covered with microporous tape sheets for better

oxygenation. Every 24 hs methanol was added to a final concentration of 0.5% and pH
was adjusted to 6 if necessary. Induction was maintained during 72-90 h at 28 o​​ C, then
cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min and the supernatant was
frozen at -80C until it was used.
The purification of RBD from culture media was performed using a NTA-Ni​2+
column previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH
8.0 (equilibration solution). The media supernatants was adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH,
centrifuged 20 min at 12,000 xg and loaded to the column. The flow through was
reloaded twice. The column was washed with an equilibration solution containing
20-30 mM imidazole. Finally, RBD was eluted with an equilibration solution containing
300 mM imidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed twice in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl buffer, pH 7.4, and quantified by absorbance at 280 nm (see below) and stored at
-80 ​o​C.

Absorption spectra (240-340 nm range, using a 0.1-nm sampling interval) were
acquired at 20 o​​ C with a JASCO V730 BIO spectrophotometer (Japan). Ten spectra for
each sample were averaged, and blank spectra (averaged) subtracted. A smoothing
routine was applied to the data by using a Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently the
4th derivative spectra were calculated.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Analysis
Purified RBD produced in ​P. pastoris or in HEK-293T cells was boiled in sample buffer
(4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 200 mM
2-mercaptoethanol) and separated in 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were either stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE
Healthcare). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in 0.05% Tween TBS at room
temperature for 1 h and then incubated at 4 o​​ C overnight with a specific polyclonal
serum produced by immunization of mice with RBD produced in HEK-293T cells.
HRP-conjugated anti-mouse were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Scientific).

molar ellipticity.
Steady-state tryptophan fluorescence measurements were performed in an
Aminco-Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell
holder connected to a circulating water bath set at 20 o​​ C. A 0.3-cm path length cell was
used. The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm and emission data were collected in
the range 310–450 nm. The spectral slit-width was set to 3 nm for both
monochromators. The protein concentration was 3.0-5.0 μM, and the measurements
were performed in a buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH
7.40.
Temperature-Induced

Denaturation

Monitored

by

Sypro-Orange

Temperature-induced denaturation of RBD forms was monitored by the change in the
Sypro Orange dye (Thermo Fisher) fluorescence using protein at a 5.0 μM
concentration in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Samples without protein
were also included as controls. The dye was used at 2 × (as suggested by Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The temperature slope was 1 o​​ C min​-1 (from 20 to 90 o​​ C). Excitation and
emission ranges were 470–500 and 540–700 nm respectively.
The fluorescence signal was quenched in the aqueous environment but became
unquenched when the probe bound to the apolar residues upon unfolding.
Experiments by triplicate were carried out in a Step One Real-Time-PCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems, CA, U.S.A.).

SEC-HPLC was performed using a Superose-6 column (GE Healthcare). The
protein concentration was 20-30 μM, a volume of 50μL was typically injected, and the
running buffer was 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. The experiment
was carried out at room temperature (∼25 o​​ C) at a 0.5 mL min​-1 flow rate. A JASCO HPLC
instrument was used. It was equipped with an automatic injector, a quaternary pump
and a UV-VIS UV-2075 (elution was monitored at 280 nm).

Production of RBD in P. pastoris by bioreactor fermentation
P. pastoris was grown on a solid YPD medium containing 20 g L​-1 peptone, 10 g L​-1 yeast
extract, 20 g L​-1 glucose and 20 g L​-1 agar medium at 30 ± 1 o​​ C. As previously described
by Chen and coworkers​38​, liquid cultivation was carried out using low salt medium
(LSM) containing 4.55 g L​-1 potassium sulfate, 3.73 g L​-1 magnesium sulfate
heptahydrate, 1.03 g L​-1 potassium hydroxide, 0.23 g L​-1 calcium sulfate anhydrous, 10.9
mL L​-1 phosphoric acid 85% and 40 g L​-1 glycerol, in order to prevent salt precipitation
during downstream processing due to increased pH. After sterilization, 3.5 mL per liter
of filtered biotin solution (0.02 % w/v) and 3.5 mL per liter of trace metal solution
(PTM1) were added. PTM1 contained per liter: 6.0 g copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate,
0.08 g sodium iodide, 3.0 g manganese sulfate-monohydrate, 0.2 g sodium
molybdate-dihydrate, 0.02 g boric acid, 0.5 g cobalt chloride, 20.0 g zinc chloride, 65.0
g ferrous sulfate-heptahydrate, 0.2 g biotin and 5 mL sulfuric acid 5.0 mL.
Fermentations were conducted in a stirred-tank bioreactor using a four-stage
​ , with slight modifications. The first stage consisted in a
process based on Celik ​et al.​ 26,41​
batch culture using LSM medium with 40 g L​-1 glycerol as carbon source and
supplemented with 3.5 mL L​-1 PTM1 and 3.5 mL L​-1 biotin solution (0.02 % w/v). Under

these conditions yeast cells grew and reached high biomass levels without expression
of RBD, as it was under the control of ​AOX1 promoter, which is repressed when
glycerol is provided as an unlimited substrate. In the second phase, a glycerol solution
(600 g L​-1 solution supplemented with 12 mL L​-1 PTM1) was fed into the culture at a
growth-limiting rate to increase cell concentration. At the same time, a gradual
derepression of ​AOX1 promoter takes place under this glycerol-limited condition. This
phase was initiated after glycerol depletion was evidenced by an oxygen spike. Glycerol
feeding was automatically regulated according to the percentage of dissolved oxygen
(DO %) in the culture, with a cut-off of 60 % saturation. Subsequently, a short transition
stage was conducted by feeding a glycerol:methanol (3:1) mixture, thus allowing the
adaptation of cells for the growth in the presence of methanol. Finally, the induction
stage was carried out by adding pure methanol (supplemented with 12 ml L​-1 ​PTM1) in
a fed-batch mode with a growth-limiting rate. Methanol feeding was also automatically
regulated according to the level of DO % in the culture, with a cut-off 50 % saturation.
In order to obtain the inoculum for bioreactor fermentations, transformed ​P.
pastoris cells grown on YPD agar plates were inoculated into a 100-mL flask containing
20 mL of LSM medium with 10 g L​-1 glycerol (supplemented with PTM1 and biotin) and
​
cultured overnight at 30 ± 1​o​C. A volume of 300 mL of LSM containing 10 g L​-1 glycerol
(supplemented with PTM1 and biotin) in
a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with the
​
overnight culture and incubated at 30 ± 1°C until the culture reached an OD​600 of ~16.
This culture was used to inoculate 3 L of LSM with 40 g L​-1 glycerol (supplemented with
3.5 mL L​-1 ​PTM1 and 3.5 ml L​-1 biotin 0.02% w/v) in a 7-L BioFlo 115 bioreactor (New
Brunswick Scientific; Edison, NJ), which was interfaced with Biocommand Bioprocessing

Temperature was maintained at 30 ± 1°C throughout batch and glycerol fed-batch
phases and at 25 ± 1°C during transition and induction stages. The pH was maintained
at 5.0 during the first two phases, and at 5.5 in the last two, by adding H​3​PO​4 (42.5%)
and 14% (v/v) NH​4​OH, which also served as a nitrogen source. DO % was regulated by
an agitation cascade (maximum of 1200 rpm) and supplemented with filter-sterilized
(0.22 μm) air and pure oxygen when needed. The pH was measured using a pH
electrode (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Germany), and the oxygen concentration was
measured with a polarographic probe (InPro6110/320, Mettler-Toledo GmbH). Foam
formation was avoided by the addition of 3 % (v/v) antifoam 289 (Sigma-Aldrich; St.
Louis, MO). Samples were withdrawn throughout the fermentation process with the
purpose of evaluating the biomass and recombinant protein expression.
The optical density of ​P. pastoris culture samples was measured at 600 nm
using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer and converted to dry cell weights (DCW, in g L​-1​)
with a previously calculated DWC versus OD​600nm calibration
curve in accordance with
​
the formula: DCW= 0.269 x OD​600nm​ , R​2​= 0.99.
The protein profile throughout the methanol-induction phase was analyzed by
12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. RBD
expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-RBD and anti-his
antibodies. Total protein content was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280
nm using a Beckman spectrophotometer.

of RBD produced in ​P. pastoris were removed by incubation with 5 mU of
EndoglycosidaseH (Roche) in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5. Reactions were
incubated during 1 h at 37 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE 12%. Parallel control reactions
were performed under the same conditions but without adding the endoglycosidase in
each case.

Sequence identity and coverage percentages were registered and counted.
Reverse phase HPLC
For HPLC, a JASCO system equipped with an autoinjector, an oven
(thermostatized at 25 °C) and a UV detector was used. A gradient from 0 to 100%

using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (355 nm). Spectra were acquired in positive or negative
mode, depending on the sample characteristics.
​Tryptic digestion
The protein samples were digested with trypsin (Promega, mass spectrometry grade) in
(NH​4​)HCO​3 buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.0), after ON at 37 o​​ C, the cysteine side chains were
previously modified with DTT-iodoacetamide. The tryptic mixture was desalted using a

with a saturated matrix solution of α cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in
acetonitrile:water (70:30, 0.1% TFA). Alternatively, the samples were digested in a gel
following a similar protocol to that used for in solution digestion, with a previous
washing step.

Immunization of mice was carried out by experts from the High Level
Technological Service CONICET (STAN No. 4482), under ISO9001 guidelines and those
from the Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUAL).
BALB/c mice were obtained from the animal facility of the Faculty of Veterinary
Sciences, University of La Plata (Argentina), and housed at the animal facility of the

Identification of serum antibody against protein RBD in mice using an ELISA assay.
Standard ELISA procedures were followed to measure antibody response against RBD.
Briefly, RBD protein produced in ​P. pastoris ​or HEK-293T cells was used to coat
flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific NUNC-MaxiSorp) at a final concentration
of 1 µg/ml (100 µl/well) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) coating buffer (pH 7.4) at
4 °C overnight. After blocking with 8% non-fat dry milk PBS for 2h at 37°C the plates
were washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Serially diluted
mouse sera were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h in PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk
(blocking solution), and then the plates were washed with PBST. For total specific IgG
determination, IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (DAKO P0447)
was diluted 1/1000 in blocking solution and added to the wells. After incubation for 1 h
at 37 °C, plates were washed 5 times with PBST and developed with
3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbiphenyldiamine (TMB) for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with
50 µl/well of 1.0 M H​2​SO​4 (stop solution). The absorbance was measured in a
microplate reader (Thermo Multiscan FC ELISA) at 450 nm (A​450​). The antibody titer was
determined as the inverse of the last dilution that was considered positive, with a
cut-off value defined as A​450​= 0.20, which was twice as high as that from a pool of
Normal mice Sera (from 30 unimmunized animals). Statistical significance was
evaluated by the Student’s t-test, using a logarithmic transformation of the ELISA titers.
Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05.
