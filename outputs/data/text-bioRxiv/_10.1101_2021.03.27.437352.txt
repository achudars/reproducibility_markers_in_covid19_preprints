ABSTRACT: The spike protein in the envelope of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) interacts with the receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the
host cell to facilitate the viral uptake. Angiotensin II (Ang II) peptide, which has a naturally high
affinity for ACE2, may be useful in inhibiting this interaction. In this study, we computationally
designed several Ang II mutants to find a strong binding sequence to ACE2 receptor and examined
the role of ligand substitution in the docking of native as well as mutant Ang II to the ACE2
receptor. The peptide in the ACE2-peptide complex was coordinated to zinc in the ACE2 cleft.
Exploratory molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to measure the time-based stability
of the native and mutant peptides and their receptor complexes. The MD-generated root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) values are mostly similar between the native and seven mutant peptides
considered in this work, although the values for free peptides demonstrated higher variation, and
often were higher in amplitude than peptides associated with the ACE2 complex. An observed
lack of a strong secondary structure in the short peptides is attributed to the latter’s greater
flexibility and movement. The strongest binding energies within the ACE2-peptide complexes
were observed in the native Ang II and only one of its mutant variants, suggesting ACE2 cleft is
designed to provide optimal binding to the native sequence. An examination of the S1 binding site
on ACE2 suggests that complex formation alone with these peptides may not be sufficient to
allosterically inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. However, it opens up the potential
for utilizing AngII-ACE2 binding in the future design of molecular and supramolecular structures
to prevent spike protein interaction with the receptor through creation of steric hindrance.

COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a major health issue with
global impacts higher than any other infectious disease in recent history1. One major challenge in
containing the disease spread stems from a high level of respiratory transmission. Decreasing the
ability of the virus to infect the respiratory epithelial cells could offer an effective measure to
control disease spread and severity. To infect hosts’ cells, spike (S) protein found in SARS-CoV2 will first be primed by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), acting on the S2
domain.2,3 The S1 domain of the primed S protein, displayed on the virus surface, will then interact
with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located in the lipid rafts of hosts’ cell membranes,
inducing endocytosis and eventual infection.4,5 To prevent the viral infection, several research
groups have aimed to block this interaction by inhibiting the S protein.6–8 This approach requires
the design of novel inhibitors with high affinity for the S protein. Alternatively, inhibitors can be
developed for ACE2 utilizing its native substrate, angiotensin II (Ang II) peptide as a starting
structure. Physiologically, ACE2 cleaves a single amino acid from the C-terminus of the
octapeptide Ang II and helps to regulate blood pressure. ACE2 can be classified as a gluzincin
from the amino acid sequence found coordinating to zinc at the Ang II binding site.9,10 From the
known properties of this class of metalloprotease, the catalysis will occur through nucleophilic
addition of a water molecule coordinated to zinc found within the ACE2 structure.10 Although the
affinity of Ang II for ACE2 is high, it does not share an active binding site with S protein, and thus
might not be effective alone in blocking the binding of S protein.9,11 However, Ang II peptide can
be incorporated in a peptide-nanoparticle conjugate12, which could physically block the S protein
interaction with ACE2 following binding of Ang II at its receptor site. The success of such
approach will highly depend on the affinity of Ang II for ACE2 and the affinity can potentially be

improved through alterations in the Ang II primary structure as shown in the study by Clayton et
al.13 Although this work has experimentally screened a number of mutant Ang II sequences, several
other sequence possibilities are yet to be examined. This study aims to use computational methods
to determine and compare the affinities of reported and additional unexamined Ang II mutants
with the goal of finding a sequence that binds strongly to ACE2.
Computational approaches are commonly used in drug design as they allow for reductions
in cost and time when scanning for new targeting molecules. Several groups have used
computational strategies to search for new inhibitor molecules for S protein and ACE2.14,15 In these
approaches, potential inhibitors are docked to the receptor and undergo molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations followed by calculations of binding free energy. In these studies, the ability to
accurately estimate the interactions that could be further experimentally validated, depend
critically on the assignment of proper parameters to all atoms and interactions found within the
system for the MD simulations and binding free energy calculations.
Although it is estimated that 10% of the human proteome contains zinc, it remains
challenging to completely parameterize it for MD simulations.16 Interactions between zinc and
amino acids (cysteine, histidine, tyrosine, and carboxylic acids) can be unusually strong and can
involve complex charge transfer and polarization, which are not accounted for in classical Amber
or CHARMM forcefield parameters.17–21 While several methods have been developed to
parameterize these interactions, these strategies generally fall into two main categories, namely
bonded and non-bonded models. The bonded model generates explicit bonds between zinc and
coordinating atoms, fixing the coordination geometry and preventing ligand exchange.22–25 This
method also involves the calculation and assignment of partial charge on the zinc ion, which is
more realistic than assignment of the formal +2 integer charge.25–27 In contrast, the non-bonded

model assigns a +2 integer charge on zinc and allows for ligand exchange during MD simulations.28
However, it is accepted that this model fails to describe tetra- and penta- coordinated structures
and tends to prefer octahedral coordination geometries.22,29–31
In this work, we design, dock, and simulate several Ang II mutant sequences to find a
strong binding sequence for ACE2. Native peptide and each mutant was docked to zinc at each of
the possible coordination sites found within the peptide, replacing the existing water molecule at
the coordination site. We also examine the potential impact of peptide binding to ACE2 on the
structure of the S protein binding region.

RESULTS
To study the influence of peptide sequence on ACE2 binding, we considered seven mutant
Ang II peptides and compared those against the native Ang II sequence (Figure1A). The mutant
peptides were obtained by making single or double mutations at amino acid positions 4-6 of the
native sequence. The structures of these peptides are included in the supporting information (SI)
Figure S1. In previous experimental work, two of these sequences (DRVYIYPF and DRVYVYPF)
were demonstrated to increase ACE2 inhibition and reduce peptide cleavage13. The other five
mutants were designed to test the replacement of tyrosine with the stronger coordinating residues,
glutamic acid and cysteine. The stability of the mutant peptides was analyzed by computing the
RMSD over a 48 ns production run (Figure 1B, S2). We observed that the average RMSD values
and the magnitudes of fluctuations of these mutant peptides (range of average RMSD and standard
deviations: 3.96-5.51 ± 0.67-1.10 Å) were comparable to the average RMSD value of native Ang
II (4.76 ± 0.90 Å). The relatively high fluctuations in RMSD values can be attributed to the lack
of organized secondary structure within these small peptides.

sequences indicate the mutations from the native Ang II sequence.
Docked ACE2-peptide structures were obtained, where the peptide was coordinated to zinc
in the ACE2 cleft as shown in Figure 2A. To be noted that the S1 binding region on ACE2, as
obtained from literature14, is located outside the Ang II binding pocket. From the classification and
known activity of ACE2, it is known that the zinc ion found in ACE2 participates in the cleavage
of phenylalanine (F) residue from Ang II10. When Ang II peptide approaches the zinc ion located
in the ACE2 cleft, ligand substitution can occur, with peptide replacing the water typically found
coordinating to zinc. Several sites on Ang II can participate in this coordination including aspartic
acid (D), tyrosine (Y), histidine (H), and the C-terminus of the peptide. Coordination with zinc at
each of these sites can be quite strong, thus allowing a stable binding of the peptides to ACE2
without being cleaved, as was determined experimentally13. Four complexes were generated for

Next, we examined the stability of the ACE2-peptide complex and compared the
differences due to coordination at various sites of interest within the complex. The RMSD of the
ACE2-peptide complexes was calculated throughout the duration of the 10 ns production run
(Figure 3A). To verify that this runtime is sufficient to capture the true behavior, 50 ns production
runs were performed for the native Ang II-ACE2 complexes (Figure 3A) to compare the effects of
a longer simulation time. We found that the longer simulation time did not make a major impact
on the average RMSD or magnitude of fluctuations, thus confirming the validation of the results

from a shorter run of 10 ns. Interestingly, a noticeable difference was observed between the RMSD
values of the whole ACE2-peptide complex (Figure 3A-B) and the peptide within the ACE2peptide complex (Figure 3C-D). The RMSD values of a single peptide also demonstrated larger
variability when amino acid residues at different positions of the chain were selected to coordinate
with zinc.

peptides during the production run, there were also some changes in the structure of the peptide
binding site on ACE2. The changes in the secondary structure of the interacting residues, namely
the residues within 3.5 Å of the peptide in the docked structure of ACE2, during the 10 ns
production run is shown in Figure 4E-H. The binding free energy of each peptide, from the ACE2peptide complexes, is plotted in Figure 5. While the interacting residues with α-helix and β-sheet
secondary structures were relatively stable, fluctuations in structures were commonly observed for
coils to turns. Furthermore, these changes were most prominent when the C-terminus of Ang II
was coordinated to zinc.
The affinity of peptide binding to ACE2 was evaluated by calculation of binding free
energy. The strongest binding free energies, with values more negative than -300 kcal/mol, were
observed for native Ang II and DRVYVYPF mutant sequence when coordinated to zinc at the
fourth residue (Figure 5). To further explore these unusually high values in comparison to other
sequences, we made changes to the default MM/PBSA calculation. This modified approach took
into consideration the energy contributions from changing zinc coordination bonds in the bonded
model for zinc, as well as an adjusted free energy for unbound ACE2, which would have a different
charge distribution on residues coordinated to zinc. After these adjustments, the resulting binding
free energy of Ang II coordinated to zinc at tyrosine did not elicit any major change in the results,
further suggesting there the observed difference is unlikely due to an artifact of the procedure for
binding free energy calculation. The DRVEIYPF sequence also showed a high binding energy,
however, here the coordination to zinc was observed on the first residue (D).

complexes. Residues at four different position in the peptide chain were considered for
coordination to zinc. Bolded residues correspond to mutations from the native Ang II sequence.

Finally, we examined whether the interaction of Ang II or the mutant peptides could
potentially elicit allosteric inhibition of S1 binding to ACE2 (Figure 6). The RMSDs of ACE2
residues at the S1 binding region, as identified by Han et al.14, were calculated during the
production run of the ACE2-peptide complexes (Figure 6A). The average RMSD values in this
figure were comparable to those of the entire protein during this simulation (Figure 3).
Additionally, we studied the change in secondary structure of the interacting residues located at
the S1 binding region during 10 ns production run (Figure 6B). While the α-helical structure
remained stable during the run, some variability in the secondary structure at residues 82M and
355D were observed. However, this change is unlikely to impact the binding of spike protein to
ACE2.

DISCUSSION
We found that binding of native and mutant Ang II peptides to ACE2 results in more rigid peptides
along with a reorganization of the secondary structure of the binding residues in ACE2 cleft. While
an increased peptide stability is expected to correspond with a strong binding energy, we observed
strong binding energies for native Ang II and DRVYVYPF mutant. Lastly, it was found that Ang
II binding to ACE2 might not be sufficient to affect the secondary structure of S1 binding residues
of ACE2, suggesting that Ang II does not allosterically inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction.
The production run for the ACE2-peptide complexes generated a higher average RMSD
and standard deviation values for the peptides compared with the rest of the ACE2-peptide
complexes. This difference can be attributed to the lack of strong secondary structure in the short

peptides (Figure S3), allowing for greater flexibility and movement than the larger and more
structured ACE2 protein. Our results also indicate that docking the peptides to ACE2 results in
changes in the ACE2 secondary structure (Figure 4). While residues 274F, 343V, 345H, 363L and
510Y tend to alternate between the unstable turn and coil configurations in the native Ang II-ACE2
complexes, residues 129T and 512F become more stable as they shift from turns and coils to
various helices and β-sheets.
The initial selection of mutants for this study was based on the experimental work reported
by Clayton et al., which examined the peptides DRVYVYPF, and DRVYIYPF.13 These two
mutants were shown to exhibit a stronger inhibition of ACE2 than the native Ang II on a quenched
fluorescent substrate assay and demonstrated a higher resistance to enzymatic cleavage. The results
from this experimental work suggest that the 6th residue of Ang II could play an important role in
binding to ACE2. To further understand the role of amino acid residue located at this position, in
this work, we investigated three additional mutant sequences DRVYIEPF, DRVYICPF, and
DRVEIYPF. Specifically, we examined mutations with introduction of cysteine and glutamate as
the 6th residue since these amino acids are known to coordinate strongly to the zinc ion.
Additionally, in our preliminary analysis on binding energy calculation of native Ang II,
DRVYVYPF, and DRVYIYPF, it was observed that coordination to Y at the fourth position
resulted in strong binding to ACE2. To explore the potential role of 4th residue in the binding event,
we considered additional sequences with mutations at the fourth position (DRVEIHPF,
DRVCIHPF, DRVEIYPF).
Our analysis showed that native Ang II and DRVYVYPF each form a complex to ACE2
with a notably strong binding free energy more negative than -300 kcal/mol. The fourth amino
acid residue (Y) of the sequences was found to coordinates with zinc in these situations. The

reasons for the observed effects are not clearly understood at this time as tyrosine residue at fourth
position did not result in similar strong binding free energies for other sequences considered. One
potential limitation and a source of variability could be from the lack of entropy calculations in
MM/PBSA protocol. However, these errors tend to be quite small, even with flexible ligands, and
therefore, it is highly unlikely to make a major contribution to the differences found in our
observations55,56. The potential role of kinetics also cannot be excluded as it plays a critical role in
computing large binding free energies. It is possible that while these states are thermodynamically
favorable, the kinetics presents a large activation energy barrier, preventing the formation of these
final states. The impact of kinetics, which requires more computationally expensive techniques,
however, is beyond the scope of the current work.
During the production run, the S1 binding region generated a similar RMSD to the rest of
the protein complex, ruling out any increased movement in this region. Additionally, the secondary
structure of this binding region remains largely unchanged except for the two residues at 82M and
355D. Both findings suggest very few structural changes in the S1 binding region in response to
Ang II binding. Thus, a relatively little impact on the S1 binding region following ACE2-peptide
interaction suggests that these peptides alone are less likely to allosterically inhibit the binding of
SARS-CoV-2. Identifying a peptide sequence that provides a strong binding at the Ang II binding
cleft on ACE2 could still be an important step toward developing novel therapeutic strategies to
prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. A high-affinity peptide sequence conjugated to a nanostructure
will enable binding to the ACE2 proteins displayed on the cell membrane surface and can inhibit
the interaction with the virus spike protein by physically blocking the access of the S1 binding
domain. The efficacy of such strategy can further be enhanced by presenting the sequence at a very

high density on a nanostructure such as self-assembled peptide nanofibers32, which would allow
the additional advantage of multivalent binding33.

CONCLUSIONS
We have performed molecular docking studies to examine the binding of native Ang II
sequence and several mutant variants to ACE2 receptor, considering zinc coordination in the
interaction. Among these sequences, we found that the native Ang II sequence is optimal for
binding to the ACE2 cleft with only one of the mutant sequences demonstrating binding energies
of similar amplitude. The strong binding energy was associated with a tyrosine residue in the fourth
position of the peptide sequence coordinating to the zinc atom in the cleft. Furthermore, our
analysis of S1 binding region suggests that native and mutant Ang II peptides alone are unlikely
to inhibit the interaction between ACE2 and S protein. However, a knowledge of strong binding
sequences for the ACE2 cleft could open the possibility of developing new strategies to prevent
virus binding to cells. Specifically, presenting these sequences at a high density on a larger
nanostructure could efficiently occupy the available ACE2 receptors on cell surface and physically
block further access of the virus spike protein to the receptor binding site.

METHODS
Obtaining Structures. The experimentally derived structures for Ang II and ACE2,
1N9V34 and 1R429 respectively, were obtained from the RCSB PDB (rcsb.org)35. Initial Ang II
mutants’ structures were derived through use of PDB manipulator36 found in CHARMM-GUI37–39
to induce single-point mutations. To improve these structures, Visual Molecular Dynamics
(VMD)40 was used to add a water box with a padding of 5 Å as well as add Na+ and Cl- ions to

neutralize charge and establish a NaCl concentration of 0.15 M. The mutants then underwent
minimization under constant temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 atm) for 10 ps using Nanoscale
Molecular Dynamics (NAMD)41. Before proceeding, Ramachandran plots created with
MolProbity42 and RMSD plots created in VMD were analyzed to check the generated structures
and the minimization procedure. The Ramachandran plots for each minimized peptide can be
found in the SI Figure S4.
Docking and Model Selection. To dock the desired ligands from Ang II or mutant peptides
to zinc within the ACE2 structure, GM-DockZn43 was used. This program determines potential
coordination sites on the ligand molecule and docks each site to the zinc ion. While models are
typically sorted with a scoring function, in this scenario, models are preferably selected based on
coordination geometry. It is critical that the coordination geometry is made accurate during
docking, as it will become fixed during zinc parameterization using the bonded model. As
previously demonstrated by Der, ideal coordination distances and angles involving zinc were used
to score each docked model’s coordination geometry44. The values used for model evaluation are
included in the SI Table S1. Using these scores, four structures were selected for each peptide
sequence, coordinated to zinc at a different residue of the sequence.
Zinc Parameterization. To prepare structures for parameterization, structural files were
first converted from CHARMM to Amber format with Bio3D45 which includes the removal of all
hydrogen atoms. The protonation state of each titratable residue was determined through version
3.2 of H++46–48, and hydrogens were added accordingly. To parameterize the zinc coordination site,
MCPB.py49 was used. The bonded model was selected to reflect partial charges found on the
various atoms within the coordination complex and prevent ligand substitution events during later
MD simulations. During the MCPB.py procedure, bond and angle parameters for the zinc ion were

generated using the Empirical method50. Restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges for
atoms within the coordination complex were calculated using quantum mechanics (QM)
simulations with GAMESS-US51. Using AmberTools2052, a water box with a padding of 10 Å and
neutralizing ions were added.
MD Simulations. Using the solvated and neutralized docked complexes, minimization was
performed for 30 ps with a step size of 1 fs at 310 K and 1 atm. Equilibration of the docked
complexes was then performed at 310 K with constant volume for 2 ns with a step size of 1 fs,
followed by a 10 ns production run using the same conditions53–55. The calculations for the Ang IIACE2 complexes were performed on Clarkson University’s ACRES cluster using the Linuxx86_64-ibverbs-smp version of NAMD. For the native and mutant Ang II sequences alone,
production runs of 48 ns were performed, after 2 ns equilibration. The calculations of these
relatively smaller sized systems were performed with a multicore version of NAMD on a Linux
server.
Binding Free Energy Calculation. The Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann
Surface Area (MM/PBSA) approach was used to determine binding free energies utilizing
trajectories created during the MD production runs. The CaFE56 plugin for VMD, which utilizes
APBS57, NAMD, and VMD, was used to calculate the free energies of the ligand, receptor and
docked complex. In this protocol, the free energy is computed for the receptor-ligand complex as
well as the free ligand and receptor in each frame of the production run trajectory. NAMD is used
to calculate the gas phase free energy while APBS and VMD calculate the polar and nonpolar
solvation energies, respectively. The binding free energy is computed by subtracting the average
free energies of the ligand and receptor from the average free energy of the receptor-ligand
complex.
