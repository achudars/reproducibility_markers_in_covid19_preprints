Abstract
P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that binds to P-, E-, and
L-selectins to mediate the tethering and rolling of immune cells on the surface of the
endothelium for cell migration into inflamed tissues. PSGL-1 has been identified as an
interferon-γ (INF-γ)-regulated factor that restricts HIV-1 infectivity, and has recently been found
to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we report that the expression of PSGL-1 in
virus-producing cells impairs the incorporation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
glycoproteins into pseudovirions and blocks virus attachment and infection of target cells. These
findings suggest that PSGL-1 may potentially inhibit coronavirus replication in PSGL-1+ cells.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic afflicting more than 10
million people in over 200 countries and territories, resulting in more than 500,000 deaths as of
June 30th, 2020. Currently, there are no effective treatments or vaccines. Understanding virushost interactions is critical for developing novel therapeutics and vaccines. P-selectin
glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, also known as SELPLG or CD162) is a human protein recently
identified to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity (1). PSGL-1 binds to the selectin family of
proteins, P-, E-, and L-selectin (2), and mediates immune cell tethering and rolling on the surface
of endothelium to promote cell migration into inflamed tissues (3). In the context of viral
infection, PSGL-1 has been identified as an IFN-γ-regulated inhibitory factor involved in
blocking HIV-1 infectivity (4), and was recently found to possess broad-spectrum antiviral
activity (1), blocking viral infections through steric hindrance of particle attachment to target
cells (1, 5).
The coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins play an essential role in viral entry by binding the cellsurface receptor on target cells and mediating the fusion between viral and cellular membranes
during virus entry (6). The S protein is also the target of neutralizing antibodies generated by the
infected host. Because of its central role in virus infection and adaptive immunity, the S protein
is a prime target for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. In addition to the
adaptive arm of the host immune response, viral infections trigger an innate immune response,
largely induced by IFN, that sets up an antiviral state. Hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)
are induced by viral infection (7). While the role of some ISGs in blocking the replication of
particular viruses has been well established, the vast majority of ISGs have not been
characterized. Because of the significance of host innate immunity in viral transmission and

replication within and between hosts, there is an unmet need to understand these antiviral
inhibitory factors in detail.
Previous studies have demonstrated that PSGL-1 can be incorporated into HIV-1 virions, and its
virion incorporation subsequently blocks viral infectivity (1, 5). To investigate the ability of
PSGL-1 to restrict coronavirus infection, we first established a lentiviral vector-based
coronavirus pseudovirus infection system (8), in which the S proteins from either SARS-CoV or
SARS-CoV-2 were used to pseudotype lentiviral particles (Fig. 1A). Using this system, we
assembled particles in the presence or absence of PSGL-1 (1), and then used the particles to
infect target Vero and Calu-3 cells, which endogenously express the primary SARS-CoV and
CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (9, 10). The expression of PSGL-1 in
viral producer cells had a minor (∼ two-fold) effect on the release of SARS-CoV and –CoV-2
pseudovirions (Fig. 1B and 1C), consistent with the previous finding that PSGL-1 expression
has minimal effects on viral release (1). However, the infectivity of PSGL-1-imprinted SARSCoV particles was completely abrogated in Vero cells (Fig. 1D), demonstrating the ability of
PSGL-1 to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV S-bearing virions.
We further tested the effect of PSGL-1 on the infectivity of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with
the SARS-Cov-2 S protein. We found that particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein
had much lower infectivity than those pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein. To resolve this
technical issue, we developed a more sensitive reporter system in which a luciferase reporter
(Luc) gene was expressed from the HIV-1 LTR in the presence of co-expressed HIV-1 Tat
protein (11) (Fig. 1A). A major advantage of this system is that high-level Luc expression can be
achieved upon transactivation by co-expressed Tat protein following viral entry, which
minimizes non-specific Luc background from non-productive viral entry (12). Using this system,

we found that the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is also potently inhibited by the
expression of PSGL-1 in the virus-producer cells (Fig. 1E and 1F). Together, these results
demonstrate that PSGL-1 expression in the virus-producer cells severely diminishes the
infectivity of virions bearing SARS coronavirus S proteins.
To investigate possible mechanisms, we analyzed the virion incorporation of SARS-CoV S
proteins in the presence of PSGL-1. Our previous study showed that PSGL-1 can inhibit the
incorporation of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (1). As shown in Fig. 2B, the expression of
PSGL-1 in the virus-producer cell also decreased the amount of both SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 S proteins on virions. We and other previously reported that PSGL-1-mediated inhibition
of virion infectivity is through steric hindrance of particle attachment to target cells, which does
not depend on the presence of viral envelope glycoproteins (1, 5). We performed a virion
attachment assay and observed that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or
SARS-CoV-2 S protein produced from PSGL-1-expressing cells were impaired in their ability to
attach to target cells (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that the presence of PSGL-1 on virus
particles can structurally hinder virion interaction with the target cells even in the presence of
remaining S proteins, consistent with previous studies of PSGL-1 and HIV-1 infection (1, 5).
In this report, we demonstrate that the expression of PSGL-1 in virus-producer cells impairs the
infectivity of virions bearing the S protein of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, a phenotype
shared among several other viruses (e.g., HIV-1, murine leukemia virus, and influenza virus)
found to be sensitive to PSGL-1 restriction (1). PSGL-1 has been suggested to be expressed in
certain lung cancer cells (13), and in lung phagocytes that control the severity of pneumoccal
dissemination from the lung to the bloodsstreem (14, 15). Nevertheless, it remains to be
determined whether PSGL-1 is expressed in SARS coronavirus target cells in the lungs, and, if

so, whether its expression can impair viral infection. In HIV-1 infection, the viral accessory
proteins Vpu and Nef have been shown to antagonize PSGL-1 on CD4 T cells through surface
downregulation and intracellular degradation (1, 4). It also remains unknown whether
coronaviruses possess a mechanism for antagonizing PSGL-1.

Materials and Methods
Virus assembly. The SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression vectors were kindly
provided by Gary Whittaker and Nevan Krogan, respectively. A SARS-CoV-2 S protein
expression vector was also purchased from Sinobiological. For the production of GFP reporter
lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-S, the SARS-CoV-S expression vector (0.5
µg), pCMVΔR8.2 (7.5 µg), and pLKO.1-puro-TurboGFP (10 µg) were cotransfected with either
pCMV3-PSGL-1 (2 µg), or pCMV3-Empty vector (2 µg) as previously described (1). For the
production of luciferase reporter lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2-S, the
SARS-CoV-2-S expression vector (0.5 µg), pCMVΔR8.2 (7.5 µg), and pLTR-Tat-IRES-Luc (10
µg) were cotransfected with either pCMV3-PSGL-1 (2 µg), or pCMV3-Empty vector (2 µg).
Both of SARS-CoV-S and SARS-CoV-2-S pseudotyped viral particles were produced in
HEK293T cells. Virus supernatants were collected at 48 - 84 hours post transfection,
concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and stored at -80°C.
HIV-1 p24 ELISA. SARS-CoV-S and SARS-CoV-2-S pseudotyped lentiviral particles were
quantified using an in-house p24 ELISA kit as previously described (16).
Virion incorporation of SARS-CoV S proteins. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with
HIV-1 Env-defective pNL4-3/KFS (1 µg ) and vectors expressing the S protein of either SARS-

CoV or SARS-CoV-2 (100 ng) in the presence of PSGL-1 expression vector or an empty control
vector (200 ng). Virions were purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using
antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins (Genetex), PSGL-1 (KPL-1 clone), or HIV-Ig to
detect CA protein p24.
Viral infectivity assay. Virus particles produced in the presence of PSGL-1 or the empty vector
were used to infect Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells (ATCC). Cells were pretreated with CoV-2
Pseudovirus Infection Enhancer (CoV-2 PIE), kindly provided by Virongy, for 1 hour at 37°C,
and then infected for 5 hours. Infected cells were cultured for 3 days. The percentage of GFP+
cells was quantified by using flow cytometry. For quantifying luciferase activity, cells were
washed and lysed in Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luminescence was measured by
using GloMax® Discover Microplate Reader (Promega).
Viral attachment assay. Virus particles were incubated with Vero E6 cells (pre-chilled at 4°C
for 1 hour) at 4°C for 2 hours. The cells were then washed extensively with cold PBS buffer for
5 times, and then lysed in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen). Cell lysates were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with a mouse anti-HIV-1 p24 monoclonal antibody (NIH
AIDS Reagent Program, 183-H12-5C) (1:1000 dilution) or anti-GAPDH goat polyclonal
antibody (Abcam) (1:1000 dilution) at 4˚C overnight, then washed and incubated with antimouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling) (1:2000 dilution) or anti-goat horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibody (KPL) (1:2500 dilution) at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
Chemiluminescence signals were developed with Super Signal West Femto Maximum
Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce).
