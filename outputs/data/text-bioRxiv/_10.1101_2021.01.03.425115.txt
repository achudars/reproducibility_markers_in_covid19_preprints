SARS-CoV-2 infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously anticipated,
suggesting there may be additional unknown hosts wherein the virus can evolve and potentially
circumvent effective vaccines. We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding
ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent
species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2.
This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis)
conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis
generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2.
Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by
single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination,
explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to
humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient
increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how
ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19
and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs
of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

34

SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to have evolved from an ancestor

35

(RaTG13) isolated from the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) (1), potentially fusing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.03.425115; this version posted January 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

36

with viruses from an intermediate source (e.g. pangolin; Manis javanica) (2). These zoonotic

37

origins ultimately led to the evolution of a virus that is highly transmissible among humans,

38

causing an unprecedented public health emergency (3, 4). A wide phylogenetic range of

39

mammalian species have been demonstrated to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

40

including non-human primates, dogs, cats, ferrets, hamsters and minks (5-12). Characterizing the

41

entire host range of SARS-CoV-2 is important for identifying the risks of anthroponosis and

42

zoonosis between humans and other species, which can pose a major health risk by forming

43

novel viral reservoirs where new mutations can evolve (13, 14). A recent example is mink

44

farms, where infection by humans led to the evolution of novel viral strains, which have since

45

reinfected human populations (11). Attempts to predict the host range of SARS-CoV-2 have

46

greatly underestimated the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 can infect certain non-primate species,

47

especially non-felid carnivores including mink, dog and ferret (5-11, 15). These predictive

48

methods depend on comparative sequence analyses of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

49

– the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 – and scoring based on sequence and structural

50

homology to the human ACE2 viral binding interface (15-17). The difficulty of predicting the

51

SARS-CoV-2 host range through these methods proves that the virus can bind a wide-range of

52

ACE2 orthologs despite extensive sequence divergence. This opens the possibility for the

53

existence of additional unknown mammalian hosts.

54

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the binding of the viral S-protein receptor

55

binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 (1, 18), displaying a nanomolar affinity higher than that of

56

SARS-CoV-1 (19). Previously, it was identified that a single mutation to ACE2 was sufficient to

57

decrease SARS-CoV-1 RBD binding by nearly 90% (20). By contrast, structural analyses have

58

identified that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD targets multiple binding ‘hotspots’ within the ACE2

59

ectodomain, presenting a diffuse and multifaceted binding strategy (21-23). While many sites

60

within the viral binding domain of ACE2 can modulate binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

61

RBD (24), it remains unclear how amino acid interactions between these sites facilitate viral

62

binding and infection. The ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD to bind divergent

63

sequences may be therefore be explained by ACE2 intramolecular epistasis, a form of context

64

dependence, where amino acids have different functional effects depending on residues at other

65

sites (25). Although intramolecular epistasis can limit the number of possible amino acids

66

combinations that will confer a given function (thus making evolution ‘predictable’; (26, 27)), it

67

can also give rise to novel compensatory interactions following an ‘original’ mutation (28-31),

68

ultimately generating completely different amino acid combinations converging on the same

69

structural/functional ‘solution’, making sequence-function evolution unpredictable (32-36). If

70

pervasive intramolecular epistasis exists within the viral binding interface of ACE2, then this

71

may explain why ACE2 sequence homology alone has not been a reliable predictor of viral

72

binding and infection.

73

In mammals, ACE2 evolved to serve an essential reno- and cardio-protective role in vivo,

74

mediated through its regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in

75

conjunction with ACE. The signaling peptide Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) generated by ACE—a

76

major clinical target for hypertension—stimulates vasoconstriction, inflammation, and fibrosis

77

responses through the Ang-II/AT1R axis (37, 38). ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity counteracts

78

these effects through conversion of Ang-II to Ang-(1-7), a peptide which induces vasodilatory,

79

anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects through MAS signaling (38, 39). Loss of ACE2 in

80

mice worsens cardiac dysfunction in obesity, increases diabetic kidney dysfunction, increases

81

mortality rates after myocardial infarction, and can have severe effects on cardiac contractility

82

(37, 39-41). This protective role of ACE2 is largely mediated through its enzymatic processing

83

of Ang II to Ang-(1-7), where exogenous delivery of either ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) can protect

84

against pathogenic features of multiple cardiovascular and kidney diseases (37, 41, 42). Given

85

the myriad protective roles of ACE2 enzymatic activity, it may be expected that ACE2 function

86

is highly conserved across species. However, mice display ~ 50% higher ACE2 activity relative

87

to humans (43), and are insensitive to the vasodilatory effects of Ang-(1-7) (39), suggesting

88

increased ACE2 activity in rodents may have evolved to serve non-vasodilatory protective

89

functions. These observations suggest that minor differences in ACE2 function can drive major

90

physiological differences between species, as seen in the evolution of other protein systems (27,

91

31, 44). Organismal sensitivity to mutations affecting ACE2 activity may be especially

92

pronounced due to the X-chromosome location of the ACE2 gene (45), where even heterozygous

93

ACE2 knockout females (-/x) display increased susceptibility to heart and kidney injury (39).

94

If natural variation across species has evolved to shape ACE2 function, then the sequence

95

recognized by SARS-CoV-2 may have a pleiotropic role in mediating ACE2 function. We

96

therefore investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 could be abolished without

97

disrupting ACE2 enzyme function. To expedite this, we took an evolutionary approach that

98

leveraged the natural sequence variation found in mouse ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 is unable to

99

bind (1, 18). Here we identify a specific combination of mutations unique to rodents which fully

100

abolishes RBD binding when inserted into human and dog ACE2, but which in isolation,

101

significantly decreases ACE2 enzyme activity. These detrimental intermediates would likely

102

severely compromise the cardio- and reno-protective functions of ACE2 activity, explaining why

103

these mutations are rare across mammalian species.

Results

106
107

We investigated ACE2-RBD binding as well as ACE2 enzymatic function across a range

108

of boreoeutherian mammals either susceptible or immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection [human

109

(Homo sapiens), dog (Canis lupus familiaris), and pangolin (Manis javanica); vs. mouse, (Mus

110

musculus) and Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), respectively] (1, 7, 9, 18). Using

111

flow cytometry, we found a trend of significantly stronger association of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

112

with both human and pangolin ACE2 relative to that of CoV-1, consistent with previous studies

113

(19) (Fig. 1A-D). Notably, CoV-1 and -2 RBD association was strongest with human ACE2. We

114

also found evidence that the RBD of both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 S protein could not bind mouse

115

nor bat ACE2 (Fig. 1B-D), consistent with previous studies and reaffirming pangolin as a likely

116

intermediate between bat and human (2, 7, 9, 18, 46). To complement these binding assays, we

117

next characterized the ability of ACE2 orthologs to enable SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus entry

118

into cells. We transfected ACE2 orthologs into human cells (HEK293T) and exposed these cells

119

to pseudotyped MLV particles containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Consistent with our flow

120

cytometry data and with previous studies, this assay recapitulated the host range of WT SARS-

121

CoV-2 (18), displaying significant infection of cells expressing human, dog, and pangolin ACE2,

122

but not that of mouse or bat (Fig. 1E). To investigate whether this variation in ACE2-SARS-

123

CoV-2 S binding is mirrored by functional variation in ACE2 enzyme activity, we measured the

124

carboxypeptidase activity of ACE2 orthologs in vitro using a well-characterized fluorometric

125

biochemical assay (43) (Materials and Methods; Fig. S1). Strikingly, we found significant

126

variation in ACE2 hydrolysis rates across all mammalian species, suggesting tuning of

127

enzymatic function across evolutionary history (Fig. 1F-G), perhaps in response to interspecies

128

RAAS variation. Interesting, dog, bat and pangolin all displayed low ACE2 hydrolysis relative to

129

human and mouse. Mice displayed the highest ACE2 hydrolysis rates, consistent with previous

130

reports (43). This demonstrates that ACE2 function varies considerably across species, and

131

suggests that ACE2 sequence variation may reflect diversification of ACE2 enzymatic function.

141

To test this, we first took a bioinformatic approach. We reasoned that since ACE2 has

142

evolved under pressures related to its enzymatic processing of Ang-II/Ang-(1-7), signatures of

143

natural selection at sites within the viral binding interface may reflect a potential role of those

144

sites in mediating ACE2 catalytic activity (47). We therefore searched for shifts in ACE2

145

mutational rates (dN/dS) beyond what may be expected from neutral evolutionary pressures alone

146

(48, 49). To do this, we constructed a phylogenetic dataset representing full-length mammalian

147

ACE2 sequences (Fig. S2; Table S1) and conducted a codon-based statistical phylogenetic

148

analysis (PAML, HyPhy). We found significant evidence that mammalian ACE2 is under

149

positive selection, outperforming models assuming neutral molecular evolution (Table S2). This

150

provides evidence that mammalian ACE2 functional diversification is a product of natural

151

selection, rather than neutral processes.

152

To focus our analysis on ACE2 sites responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 binding, we took

153

an evolutionary approach leveraging natural sequence variation found in mouse ACE2, which

154

SARS-CoV-2 is unable to bind (1, 18). We identified a set of six residues unique to mouse

155

ACE2 that were of particular interest due to their proximity to viral RBD residues implicated in

156

the ACE2-RBD structure (Fig. 2A). These sites contact opposite ends of the viral RBD,

157

facilitating binding through a combination of hydrogen bonds (Q24, K353), as well as van der

158

Waals forces within a hydrophobic pocket of ACE2 (L79, M82, Y83, P84) (21, 23). These

159

ACE2 residues are located outside the ACE2 active site mediating catalysis of Ang-II/Ang-(1-7)

160

(Fig. 2A; yellow), suggesting that any role of these sites in mediating ACE2 function would

161

likely be through indirect effects modulating the protein structure, as seen in other protein

162

systems (47, 50). Through phylogenetic methods (Table S2; M8; Bayes empirical Bayes), we

163

found that several of these sites deviated significantly from neutral expectations (sites 24 ,79,

164

dN/dS>1; site 353, dN/dS<1), suggesting potential functional roles (Fig.2B). Interestingly, these

165

sites are less variable in primates relative to other mammalian lineages (Fig. 2B; (16)),

166

displaying significantly decreased ACE2 evolutionary rates relative to bats (Chiroptera) and

167

rodents (Table S3; (CmD; dN/dS). These evolutionary signatures suggest that the RBD binding

168

interface of ACE2 may play a role in the functional diversification of ACE2 catalytic activity,

169

with extant residues in primates being strongly constrained.

(E) The effect of ACE2 mutations on ACE2 hydrolysis rates was measured using a fluorometric peptide
(F-G) Interaction effects between amino acids on opposite ends of the viral binding interface determine
RBD binding (F-G) and ACE2 activity (H-I) in both human (F, H) and dog ACE2 (G, I).

183

We next experimentally characterized the role of these sites on both SARS-CoV-1 and

184

CoV-2 binding and infection, as well as their effect on ACE2 catalytic activity. We did this by

185

substituting the rare residues found in mouse ACE2 into human and dog ACE2 (Fig. 2C). First,

186

we characterized the role of single mutations on the binding of the SARS-CoV-1/2 S RBD to

187

human WT and mutant ACE2 using co-immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry. In contrast

188

with SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. S3), a single mutation was not sufficient to abolish SARS-CoV-2 RBD

189

binding to ACE2 (K353H; Fig. 2D). Indeed, most single mutations had only minor effects on

190

SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding (Fig. 2D). However, each of the six single mutations displayed

191

considerable effects on human ACE2 hydrolysis activity (Fig 2E). This demonstrates that ACE2

192

residues within the RBD binding interface can indirectly modulate ACE2 activity.

193

Next, we attempted to abolish RBD binding to both human and dog ACE2 by making

194

multiple substitutions at these ACE2 sites. Strikingly, RBD binding to the ACE2 of both species

195

was abolished with just these six substitutions (Fig. 2F-G), despite numerous other sites

196

implicated in mediating interactions with the viral RBD (21, 23). Using the MLV-SARS-CoV-2

197

pseudovirus system, we found that these six substitutions in combination also significantly

198

reduced pseudovirus infection of HEK293T cells expressing wild type and mutant human and

199

dog ACE2 (Fig. S4). In both species, abolition of RBD binding depended on mutating sites 24

200

and 82 (Fig. 2F-G), despite displaying different residues in human (Q24; M82) and dog (L24;

201

T82) ACE2 (Fig. 2C). This demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same combination of

202

ACE2 positions to bind both human and dog ACE2 despite amino acid variation at these sites.

203

This may explain why bioinformatic predictions of SARS-CoV-2 host range based on human

204

ACE2 sequence homology have tended to underestimate the infection risk of species such as

205

dogs, ferrets, and minks (6, 7, 9-11, 15).

206

We reasoned that this could be due to conserved compensatory interactions between

207

ACE2 sites, allowing different residues to ultimately maintain the ACE2 structure bound by

208

SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this, we observed in both human and dog ACE2 a context-

209

dependence (epistasis) of mutational effects between the distal domains of the RBD binding

210

interface. Specifically, the quadruple mutation (L79T; T/M82S; Y83F; P84S) had a much larger

211

effect on RBD binding when a single mutation on the opposite side of the ACE2 binding cleft

212

were included the genetic background (K353H) (Fig. 2F-G). Epistasis between these distal sites

213

indicates that residues at one end of the ACE2-RBD binding cleft can modulate the structural

214

effects of residues on the other end. We hypothesized that the specific amino acid combinations

215

at these sites therefore originally evolved to maintain the ACE2 structure underpinning ACE2

216

catalytic activity. Consistent with this, we found that the detrimental functional effects of the

217

quadruple mutant (L79T; T/M82S; Y83F; P84S) as well as the K353H mutant were significantly

218

reversed when combined—a phenomenon known as sign epistasis —displaying partial

219

compensation for each other’s detrimental effects on ACE2 hydrolysis rates (Fig. H-I). Further

220

evidence of epistasis in this ACE2 domain is seen in the sextuple mutant, where introduction of

221

L24N in dog ACE2 fully rescued ACE2 activity, whereas Q24N decreased activity in human

222

relative to the quintuple mutant (Fig. H-I). This discrepancy is likely attributable to amino acid

223

interactions between site 24 and other sites not investigated. Taken together, these results

224

demonstrate that extensive amino acid interactions within the RBD binding interface of ACE2

225

indirectly mediate ACE2 enzymatic activity. This is achieved through compensatory interactions

226

that modulate the ACE2 structure recognized by SARS-CoV-2. This mechanism is conserved in

227

dog and human ACE2, which are separated by ~90 million years of evolution (51), suggesting

228

these structural interactions are a general feature of mammalian ACE2 evolution. Thus,

229

compensatory interactions in this domain appear to have facilitated divergent amino acid

230

combinations to converge and generate the same structure recognized by SARS-CoV-2 (32-36).

231

Hence, our evidence strongly suggests that the unpredictable and wide host range of SARS-CoV-

232

2 is likely due to this ancient epistasis of ACE2.

250

Why did these substitutions serendipitously blocking SARS-CoV-2 binding only evolve

251

in some rodent species? The compensatory interactions inherent to intramolecular epistasis can

252

both open and close evolutionary trajectories depending on how accessible favorable mutational

253

combinations are within evolutionary space (31, 52-54). In humans and dogs, this trajectory

254

appears to have been closed by the presence of deep valleys containing detrimental intermediates

255

with compromised ACE2 function (Fig. 3A). Traversal of evolutionary valleys is thought to be

256

associated with fluctuations in environmental variables, which can change physiological

257

constraints on protein function (31, 53). Since ACE2 activity plays major roles in the

258

cardiovascular system, we reasoned that cardiovascular differences between mammalian species

259

may result in differential constraints on ACE2 sequence-function. A central cardiovascular role

260

mediated by ACE2 activity is the regulation of blood pressure via enzymatic processing of ANG-

261

(II) to ANG-(1-7) (Fig. 3B). We found extremely low human allele frequencies for missense

262

polymorphisms at these sites (gnomAD), with most at zero (Fig.3C). This is consistent with the

263

role of these sites in mediating ACE2 activity and with the known association of human ACE2

264

polymorphisms with hypertension (55, 56). We reasoned that these physiological constraints

265

would be more relaxed in animals with low blood pressures, permitting sequence-function

266

evolution. We conducted a phylogenetic statistical analysis on systolic blood pressure values

267

across mammalian species and observed a significant correlation with body size (r2=0.26;

268

p=0.001; phylogenetic independent contrast least squares linear regression) (Fig. 3D; Fig. S6).

269

Blood pressures were lowest in rodent and bat species—two lineages immune to SARS-CoV-2

270

(18, 46) which also display the highest ACE2 evolutionary rates relative to other mammals

271

(aBsREL; Fig. 3E; Table S2). This is consistent with bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) ACE2 displaying

272

the lowest hydrolysis rates relative to all other species investigated here (except Pangolin, for

273

which blood pressure measurements are not available to our knowledge). Interestingly, rodents

274

are insensitive to the vasodilatory effects of Ang-(1-7) (39), suggesting their high ACE2 activity

275

may be unrelated to low blood pressure. Although speculative, relaxed physiological constraints

276

on the vasodilatory role of ACE2 function (due to small body size) may explain why rodents

277

were situated to tolerate an evolutionary trajectory that presumably contained detrimental

278

intermediates as seen in dog and human ACE2 mutants.

279

An alternative explanation is that these evolutionary valleys may not exist in rodents.

280

Specifically, this trajectory may have been opened to mice by permissive mutations (25, 31) that

281

compensated for the subsequent introduction of rare variants that are strongly deleterious in dog

282

and human ACE2 backgrounds. To understand if ancestral rodent ACE2 displayed high activity

283

before the introduction of these mutations, we constructed a large jawed vertebrate ACE2

284

phylogenetic dataset (Fig. 3F, S5) and reconstructed the ancestral rodent (RodAnc) ACE2 using

285

likelihood methods (57). Reconstructed RodAnc ACE2 had none of the rare sequence variants

286

unique to the RBD binding domain of mice (Fig. 3G). This strongly suggests that these

287

mutations appeared relatively recently in mouse ACE2 evolution. Since the C-terminus of

288

vertebrate ACE2 was too divergent to align, we constructed the full-length rodent ancestor

289

(RodAnc) ACE2 coding-sequence with either mouse (-M) or human (-H) C-termini, and

290

measured ACE2-specific hydrolysis activity. We found that RodAnc-M displayed high ACE2

291

hydrolysis activity indistinguishable from that of mouse, strongly suggesting that the rodent

292

ancestor had high ACE2 hydrolysis rates (Fig. 3H). Moreover, the RodAnc with the human C-

293

terminus displayed ACE2 activity significantly lower than mouse ACE2, but significantly higher

294

than that of human, suggesting the C-terminus is necessary, but not sufficient to explain the high

295

ACE2 activity seen in the RodAnc. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that

296

mutations outside the viral binding interface of ACE2 drove increases to ACE2 carboxypeptidase

297

activity during rodent evolution. High ACE2 activity in the rodent ancestor may have therefore

298

compensated for the subsequent introduction of rare variants that are strongly deleterious

299

mutations in dog and human ACE2 backgrounds.

Discussion
We have shown that six mutations abolishing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 binding also

303

individually disrupt ACE2 hydrolysis activity by up to 50-60%. This provides evidence that like

304

other proteins, the catalytic activity of ACE2 can be mediated by the indirect structural effects of

305

mutations to residues outside the active site (27, 47, 50). Although previous work demonstrated

306

that inactivation of the ACE2 active site had no effect on SARS-CoV-1 and -2 binding, these

307

mutations were directly within the active site far from the viral binding interface (58, 59). The

308

mutations investigated here are directly within the viral binding interface of SARS-CoV-2, and

309

from species naturally immune to SARS-CoV-2 that still maintain ACE2 activity. The surprising

310

finding that mutations abolishing binding also reduce ACE2 activity is supported by the fact that

311

human ACE2 engineered to increase viral binding (T27Y, L79T, N330Y) also displays reduced

312

ACE2 activity (24). Here we discuss the implications of pervasive epistasis in ACE2 for the

313

evolution of ACE2 function, the SARS-CoV-2 host range and therapeutic design.

314

Our work demonstrates the essential importance of the ACE2 viral binding domain on

315

catalytic function. The consequent constraints on the ACE2 amino acid sequence in humans and

316

other primates strongly indicate that protective polymorphisms in the human population are

317

unlikely, in contrast to examples such as CCR5, the co-receptor for HIV (60). Our analysis

318

shows that allele frequencies for ACE2 missense polymorphisms at six sites necessary for

319

SARS-CoV-2 binding are lower than the protein-wide average, reflecting the physiological

320

importance of these positions in mediating ACE2 catalytic activity. Although potentially

321

protective ACE2 polymorphisms have been predicted at other sites in the RBD-ACE2 interface

322

(61, 62), we show that statistically unlikely combinations of mutations are required to disrupt

323

SARS-CoV-2 binding, each of which have severe effects on ACE2 activity. Given the

324

importance of ACE2 enzymatic processing of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) in protection against

325

pathogenic features of multiple cardiovascular and kidney diseases (37, 41, 42), it is possible that

326

that the extant mutational combinations observed in nature (e.g. human, bat, dog, mouse,

327

pangolin) may all represent alternative sequence ‘solutions’ (34, 52) each uniquely required for

328

an animal’s physiology, thereby representing fitness ‘peaks’ in the sequence landscape (28, 31,

329

34, 53, 63-65). Species variation in ACE2 hydrolysis rates we observed may reflect variation in

330

renin activity levels, which are a major factor in determining circulating Ang-II levels in humans

331

(39, 66, 67). It is therefore likely that a preponderance of selective processes has shaped ACE2

332

evolution, imposed by a combination of epistatic and physiological constraints on ACE2

333

sequence-function diversification, as discussed below.

334

Our results strongly imply that the host range of SARS-CoV-2 may be broader than both

335

empirical and computational studies have suggested (5-11, 15). In fact, our results suggest that

336

the SARS-CoV-2 host range among non-primate mammals may be essentially unpredictable.

337

This warrants extreme caution for public health efforts aiming to limit the risks of anthroponosis

338

and zoonosis between humans and other species, which can form novel viral reservoirs where

339

new mutations can evolve (13, 14). This has already occurred on mink farms, where infection by

340

humans led to the evolution of novel viral strains, which have since reinfected human

341

populations (11). The demonstrated infection of minks and other non-felid carnivores by SARS-

342

CoV-2 despite predictions to the contrary (6, 7, 9-11, 15) challenges the utility of predicting

343

infection risk from sequence homology to the human ACE2 viral binding interface (15-17). Our

344

results reconcile this apparent conundrum by demonstrating that the wide host range of SARS-

345

CoV-2 appears to originate from the structural effects of interacting amino acids within the

346

ACE2 viral binding interface. As in other proteins, this intramolecular epistasis makes the

347

sequence-phenotype relationship unpredictable (32-36); intramolecular epistasis has generated

348

sequence diversity driving ACE2 functional diversification (34, 35) but through similar

349

conformations all bound by SARS-CoV-2 (25, 27, 29). Only in a few lineages has the epistasis

350

of these sites been permitted to open trajectories to new conformations not recognized by SARS-

351

CoV-2 (46). Importantly, these new conformations confer ACE2 activity equivalent (bat vs dog)

352

or greater (mouse vs human) than species susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Why have

353

these mutational combinations not evolved in other mammalian lineages? The ability to traverse

354

evolutionary valleys is related to effective population sizes (31), which are negatively correlated

355

with body size (70), suggesting that the ACE2 mutational combinations investigated here may

356

have been generated by the effects of population size on mutational rates. However, given the

357

physiological importance of ACE2 activity discussed above, the existence of functionally

358

detrimental intermediates may also explain why these conformations did not evolve more

359

frequently in evolutionary history (28, 31, 34, 53, 63, 64). Our evidence suggests a confluence of

360

ancient permissive mutations and permissive cardiovascular constraints likely opened the

361

available pool of sequence variation, allowing functional and conformational diversification (25,

362

28, 29, 31). The highly effective binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 (21-23, 71) may therefore

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.03.425115; this version posted January 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

363

synergize with the epistasis of the ACE2 domain to grant the virus a wide-host range—one that

364

is very difficult to predict.

365

Our study also has relevance for therapeutic design. Human recombinant soluble ACE2

366

(hrsACE2) is in active development as a strategy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by binding the viral

367

spike protein (67, 78). In human COVID-19 patients, the catalytic activity of hrsACE2 can help

368

reduce angiotensin II levels as well as inflammation associated with COVID-19, likely through

369

elevating Ang-(1-7) levels (67). hrsACE2 may therefore have the added benefit of minimizing

370

the injury to multiple organs caused by viral-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression and

371

renin-angiotensin hyperactivation (40, 73, 79-82). However, under normal physiological

372

conditions, higher sACE2 plasma activity has been associated with increased pulmonary artery

373

systolic pressure and ventricular systolic dysfunction (83). In these instances where patients have

374

pre-existing conditions that can be exacerbated by increasing sACE2 activity it may be beneficial

375

to make use of catalytically inactive hrsACE2 that binds RBD with similar efficiency (58). There

376

is likely to be a spectrum of scenarios where variable levels of ACE2 activity is desirable, in

377

which case recombinant non-human ACE2 can serve a key role. Our results also have

378

implications for domesticated animals susceptible to infection, especially minks, for whom the

379

SARS-CoV-2 is particularly transmissible (10, 11). In lieu of a vaccine for minks and other non-

380

human mammals important to agricultural production, genetic engineering efforts could feasibly

381

introduce the six residues we observed to abolish viral binding but maintain activity in dog

382

ACE2. This would remove a dangerous reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 wherein the virus can evolve

383

and potentially challenge the efficacy of emerging vaccines.

Wild-type hACE2 with a 1D4 (C9) C-terminal tag (TETSQVAPA) was a gift from Hyeryun
Choe (Addgene plasmid # 1786 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:1786 ; RRID:Addgene_1786) (84). Sitedirected mutagenesis primers were designed to induce single amino acid substitutions via PCR
(QuickChange II, Agilent). Mouse ACE2 was cloned from cDNA synthesized from an RNA
extraction of ileum tissue from a C57/BL6 mouse sacrificed in compliance with all regulations of
the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use committee. ACE2 coding
sequences from dog (XM_014111329.2), pangolin (Manis javanica; XM_017650263.1), bat
(Rhinolophus sinicus; XM_019746337.1) and the rodent ancestor were synthesized as gblocks
(Integrated DNA technologies). All animal ACE2 inserts were cloned into a pEGFP-N1 vector,
with eGFP C-terminal tag. For interspecies comparisons, hACE2 was also cloned into pEGFPN1. The receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was obtained as a pcDNA3SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD-Fc plasmid, as a gift from Erik Procko (Addgene plasmid # 141183 ;
http://n2t.net/addgene:141183 ; RRID:Addgene_141183) (85). pcDNA3.1-SARS-Spike was a
gift from Fang Li (Addgene plasmid # 145031 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:145031 ;
RRID:Addgene_145031) (21). We used this plasmid as a template to clone the RBD of SARSCoV-1 Spike protein into pcDNA3 with a Fc C-terminal tag. This RBD consisted of residues 318
to 510, as previously described (numbering as per AAP13441.1) (86).

HEK293T cells were transfected with ACE2-1D4, or SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD-Fc constructs
using TransIT-X2 (Mirus). 24hrs after transfection the media of RBD-transfected cells was
replaced with OptiPRO SFM (ThermoFisher). 72hrs after transfection, the media from RBDtransfected cells was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a 3000
kDa molecular weight cutoff. In parallel, ACE2-transfected cells were harvested and washed
with PBS. For flow cytometry, 5.0 x 105 cells were resuspended in 1mL incubation buffer
[Dulbecco’s PBS containing 0.02% EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich), 50µg/mL DNase I (Worthington)
and 5mM MgCl2] and incubated with 20 ug/mL of RBD-Fc for 30 minutes at room temperature
as previously described (19). Cells were then washed with buffer (5% FBS, 0.1% Sodium Azide
in PBS) and incubated with human ACE2 Alexa Fluro 647-conjugated antibody (1µg/106 cell,
#FAB9332R, R&D Systems), human IgG Fc PE-conjugated antibody (10µg/106 cell,
#FAB110P, R&D Systems) or human IgG Fc APC-conjugated antibody (10µg/106 cell,
#FAB110A, R&D Systems) for 30 minutes at room temperature. LSR II (BD bioscience) was
used to collect the data and Flowjo (Flowjo, LLC.) was used for analysis, conducted as
previously described (19). For immunoprecipitation, ACE2-transfected cells were lysed in a PBS
buffer containing 1% CHASPO (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated with Dynabeads Protein G
(ThermoFisher) and 2µg of RBD-Fc concentrate. Dynabeads were washed with PBS (0.5%
CHAPSO), and elutions were immunoblotted using antibodies against 1D4 (Abcam; ab5417) and
Human IgG Fc (Abcam; ab97225).

SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) were generated based on a
published protocol (87). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with three plasmids, which
express MLV Gag and Pol, firefly luciferase reporter and SARS-CoV-2 S protein. 48 h after
transfection, culture medium containing pseudotyped particles were centrifuged and then filtered
through a sterile 0.45 µm pore-sized filter to remove cell debris. For transduction, HEK293T
cells were first transfected with ACE2 orthologs using lipofectamine 3000. 24 hours later,
200µL of SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped MLV were added to each well and incubated for 2
days. The transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring the activity of luciferase using
luciferase assay system (Promega) and GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega).

HEK293T cells were transfected with ACE2 constructs using TransIT-X2 (Mirus). 72hrs later
cells were washed in PBS and lysed in ACE2 reaction buffer pH 6.5 (1M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X100, 0.5mM ZnCl2, 75mM Tris-HCl). Cell lysates were diluted in reaction buffer to 0.5µg
protein, incubated ± the ACE2-specific inhibitor 10µM DX600 (Cayman Chemical) for 20
minutes at room temperature, followed by addition of 100µM Mca-YVADAPK(Dnp) (R&D
Systems) and incubation at 37oC. Fluorescence emission at 405 nm was measured at 10, 60, and
120 minutes using a microplate reader (BMG Labtech) after excitation at 320 nm. Hydrolysis
rates were quantified as fluorescence units per minute, using the slope of fluorescence
development between 10 and 120 minutes, as previously described (43). An ANOVA general
linear model with fluorescence as the response variable, mutation as the factor, and assay time as
the covariate was fit to fluorescence data generated in the ACE2 hydrolysis assay. Statistical
differences in ACE2 hydrolysis rates were determined using a cross factor between the mutation
factor and time covariate.

ACE and ACE2 coding sequences from 107 species representing all major jawed vertebrate
lineages were obtained from GenBank (Table S4), and aligned using PRANK followed by
manual adjustment (88). This alignment was used to estimate a gene tree using PhyML 3.1 (89)
(Fig. S5), with GTR selected using automatic model selection based on AIC values (90), and
aLRT SH-like branch support. This ML tree was rooted using ACE, and recapitulated all major
phylogenetic relationships (Fig. S5 (91)). Ancestral sequences and posterior probability
distributions were inferred using the best fitting models in the codeml package of PAML 4.9
(Table S5) (49). For estimation of dN/dS values using random sites models in the codeml
package (49) and FUBAR (92), ACE sequences were pruned from the dataset, non-mammalian
ACE2 was also pruned, and additional mammalian ACE2 sequences added to increase sampling.
This alignment represented 89 species (Table S1), and was used to infer a ML gene tree using
IQ-Tree (Fig. S2), with the substitution model auto selected, followed by ultrafast bootstrap
analysis and SH-aLRT branch tests (93). PAML random sites models were used to investigate
evidence of positive selection (Table S2). To test for dN/dS differences amongst branches in the
phylogeny, clade model D (CmD) (94) was used to analyze an ACE2 alignment containing only
those sites of interest in the ACE2 viral binding interface (Table S3). M3 with three site classes

We conducted a phylogenetic comparative analysis on systolic blood pressure dataset by
combining bat data with mammalian data compiled from a previous study (77, 95) . We pruned
this dataset to include only species with fossil calibrated divergence times (91) (Fig. S6). Body
size values (grams) were obtained from the Ageing Genomic Resources AnAge database (96).
We conducted a phylogenetically independent correlation analysis (least squares linear
regression; Fig. S6) by using the PDTREE program of the PDAP module of MESQUITE (97,
98) to calculate phylogenetically independent contrasts of log10 body mass (grams) systolic blood
pressures (mmHg) as the dependent variable. Before independent contrasts were calculated,
branch lengths reflecting divergence times were ln transformed to meet the assumptions of
independent contrast analysis (97, 98). To produce dN/dS estimates for branches in the
untransformed phylogeny, we pruned the mammalian ACE2 alignment to match the species
represented in the blood pressure dataset, and subjected the phylogeny and the alignment to
analysis by aBSREL(99).

Recombinant ACE2 hydrolysis activity in solubilized transfected HEK293T cells. ACE2
hydrolysis activity was measured using a fluorogenic peptide substrate (Mca-YVADAPK(Dnp)OH) incubated with lysates of HEK293T cells for 2 hours. Cells were either untransfected or
were transfected with a human ACE2 construct. Incubation of lysate-peptide mixture with a
ACE2-specific inhibitor (DX600) reduced fluorescence attributable to ACE2 hydrolysis activity.
