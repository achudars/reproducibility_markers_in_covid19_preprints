A new clinical syndrome associated to SARS-CoV-2 has been described in children. It has been named as
Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). This
new disease is a main cause of hospital and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In this work we describe
the innate cell signature and immunophenotype of children admitted to PICU because of PIMS-TS. Also, we
compare it with healthy controls and children admitted to PICU because bacterial infection, viral infection
and Kawasaki disease. We made a prospective-retrospective observational study in a tertiary pediatric
hospital. Children admitted to PICU because of PIMS-TS from March 2020 to September 2020 were
consecutively included. They were compare with previous cohorts from our center. A total of 247 children
were included: 183 healthy controls, 25 viral infections, 20 bacterial infections, 6 Kawasaki disease and 13
PIMS-TS. PIMT-TS showed the lowest percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes with higher relative
numbers of CD4+ (p =0,000). At the same time, we describe a differential expression of CD64, CD11a and
CD11b. Monocytes and neutrophils in PIMS-TS showed higher levels of CD64 expression compared to all
groups (p = 0,000). Also, proteins involved in leukocyte tissue migration, like CD11a and CD11b were highly
expressed compare to other severe viral or bacterial infections (p = 0,000). In PIMS-TS this increased
CD11a expression could be a sign of the activation and trafficking of these leukocytes. These findings are
congruent with an inflammatory process and the trend of these cells to leave the bloodstream. In conclusion,
we compare for the first time the innate cellular response of children with PIMS-TS with other severe forms
of viral or bacterial infection and Kawasaki disease. Our findings define a differential cell innate signature.
These data should be further studied and may facilitate the diagnosis and management of these patients.

Description and comparison of PIMS-TS innate cell signature and
immunophenotype with a cohort of healthy children, severe viral and
bacterial infections and Kawasaki Disease.

A new type of affectation temporarily linked to the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in childhood has
been described. Europe, Great Britain and the United States have been the regions with the higher
number of cases[1-3]. This new clinical syndrome has been named as Pediatric Inflammatory
Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). It has clinical and
analytical similarities to Kawasaki disease and suppose a main cause of hospital and pediatric
intensive care unit (PICU) admission[4].
A majority of PIMS-TS cases are not related to active infections. An immune basis has been
proposed for its establishment. In this point, there has been described the presence of immunity
dysregulation or the release of autoantibodies. Related to that, immunoglobulin and corticoids seem
to have a preeminent role. The clinical response is usually quick and with improvement in a short
period of time[2,5].
Related to the probable role of leukocyte dysregulation the study of the cellular response in PIMSTS could be of interest. Also, its comparison with healthy children and other causes of PICU
admissions may help to describe and know the basis of their inflammation. Nowadays there are
scarce data about this in children[6].
In this work we describe the innate cell signature and immunophenotype of children admitted to
PICU because of PIMS-TS. Also, we compare it with healthy controls and children admitted to PICU
because bacterial infection, viral infection and Kawasaki disease.

Material and methods
Prospective-retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary pediatric hospital after Ethics
Committee for clinical research approval. Done prospectively in children admitted to PICU because
of PIMS-TS from March 2020 to September 2020 were consecutively included. They were compare
with previous cohorts from our center (see above). In all cases one peripheral blood sample was
extracted after parents or legal guardians consent at PICU admission. A previously established
intravenous line was always used. The volume obtained was 0.5 ml per sample and collected in
sterile EDTA tube. The sample handling was based on item 59 of the Spanish law on Biomedical
Research. Study was designed to not influence the treatment of the participating patients.
Sample processing and analysis by flow cytometry
Samples were collected in sterile EDTA at room temperature or refrigerated at 4°C, used for CD45+
cells marking and analyzed by flow cytometry in a time period shorter than 24 hours. The antibody’s
were all from Biolegend®: CD45 (clone HI30), CD4 (clone OKT4), CD8 (clone SK1), CD64 (clone
10.1), CD11a (clone TS2/4) and CD11b (clone M1/70). The surface expression were measured by
BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, New York, USA). Cells viability were
confirmed by 7-AAD staining. At least 10,000 events were recorded for each sample. The flow
cytometer settings and samples were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were identified on dot-plot profile and gated. The
intensity of CD64 surface expression was measured as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in
arbitrary units (monocytes as mCD64 and neutrophils as nCD64). The positive CD4, CD8, CD11a,
CD11b and CD64 cells were expressed as percentage.

Cohorts of analysis
Four cohorts of analysis were described:
1. Healthy patients: individuals under the age of 18 who came for programed surgery. They
do not present previous diseases or infection. Sample extraction was performed prior to
the intervention. Obtained in January 2018 to December 2019.
2. Viral and bacterial infections (VI and BI): individuals under 18 years of age admitted to
PICU because of severe infection. Samples obtained at admission. Colonization was ruled
out. Both groups are historical cohorts that have been described and published by our
group before (see bibliography).
Definitions for a microbiologically confirmed case of bacterial infection included: 1) isolation
of an organism by culture from blood, urine in a patient with clinical symptoms and signs
of urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, needle aspiration of abscess or empyema, stool
sample of a patient with symptoms of gastroenteritis, pus sample from deep wound
infection or detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen from the pleural effusion
sample of a patient with pneumonia.
The diagnosis of a microbiologically confirmed viral infection required: 1) Detection of IgM
antibodies or a fourfold increase in IgG antibodies in serum samples 2) viral antigen from
nasopharyngeal aspirate or 3) viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction of a
nasopharyngeal aspirate, biological fluid or blood.
3. Kawasaki disease (KD): children admitted to hospital or PICU which Kawasaki disease
criteria. Period January 2018-december 2019. The flow cytometry was performed at
hospital admission and prior to the initiation of immunomodulatory medication.
4. PIMS-TS: children admitted to PICU which met criteria defined for this condition (see
bibliography). To confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection a nasal and pharyngeal swab using real5

time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) was used. The presence
of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was studied through ELISA.
Statistical study
Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical program SPSS version 19.0 (IBM®). The
quantitative values are expressed as mean and standard deviation. To compare quantitative
variables between the bacterial and viral group a U Mann-Whitney test was used. Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient was bi-marginally calculated to measure the relationship between two
continuous variables. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with area under curve
(AUC), sensitivity and specificity and cut-off values was performed for mCD64 and nCD64 to define
its diagnostic accuracy for PIMS-TS. The cutt-off values were calculated by Youden index. Findings
of two-tailed p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
A total of 247 children were included: 183 healthy controls, 25 viral infections, 20 bacterial
infections, 6 Kawasaki disease and 13 PIMS-TS. In the PIMS-TS group 5 children were RT-PCR
positive, 7 were Ig G positive and one RT-PCR and IgG positive at diagnosis. There were sex
differences only in KD group. There were observed differences in age (Table 1). A negative
correlation for lymphocytes with age was observed (r= - 0,240, p = 0,001). The CD64 expression
in monocytes and neutrophils was not correlated with age or influenced by sex. The percentage of
leukocytes and MFI of each type of leukocytes are described in table 1 and Figure 1. The
significative differences between PIMS-TS and other groups are showed in Figure 1.
CD64 and CD11a neutrophils expression utility as a PIMS-TS biomarker
To study the usefulness of CD64 surface expression as a tool to predict PIMT-TS we evaluated the
receiver operating characteristics curve. As seen in Figure 2 the mCD64, nCD64 and nCD11a area
under the curve (AUC) that were near to 1. For the mCD64 it was 0,994 (p=0,000; with a cut point
of 29098 MFI and 94,1% specificity and 100% sensitivity). For the nCD64 it was 0,992 (p=0,000;
with a cut point of 8753 MFI and 90% specificity and 100% sensitivity). The nCD11a AUC was
0,992 (p=0,000; with a cut point of 5203 MFI and 91,7% specificity and 94,1% sensitivity).

Discussion
This paper compares for the first time the innate cellular signature and immunophenotyping of
severe PIMS-TS cases with a large cohort of healthy control, other severe infections diseases and
KD. In peripheral blood samples, we observed differences in almost all leukocyte populations. The
most visible of these differences affect lymphocytes and monocytes, which have the lowest values
in PIMS-TS. At the same time, we describe a differential expression of CD64, CD11a and CD11b.
These leukocyte surface proteins were exceptionally high in PIMS-TS in monocytes and
neutrophils.
As said, the cases included showed a different distribution of leukocyte populations. This
distribution of leukocyte populations is strikingly different in lymphocytes (Table 2 and Figure 1).
PIMT-TS showed the lowest percentage of lymphocytes with higher relative numbers of CD4+. This
lymphopenia has already been described in the adult population and severe critical children
because of SARS-CoV-2 infections or PIMS-TS[2,7]. Compare to other severe viral infections, we
observed that there was also a low percentage of monocytes and neutrophils (Figure 1). It is known
that PIMS-TS is usually not associated with active SARS-CoV-2 infection. An immune dysfunction
hypothesis has been proposed and explored in this children disease. Monocytes, neutrophils and
lymphocytes are critical cells in viral first response. Their migration and accumulation in infected
tissues added to the SARS-CoV-2 capacity to dysregulate this response may cause this low cell
count in peripheral blood[6]. Our group has previously described an increase in leukocyte
CD18/CD11a complex (LFA-1) expression in two short series of PIMS-TS[8,9]. It is congruent with
a state of increased cellular predisposition to leave the bloodstream. We could not analyze the
LFA-1 expression in this paper because it was not available in all groups.
Concerning immunophenotyping, we should highlight the findings observed about the expression
of CD64, CD11a and CD11b. About CD64 expression, the PIMS-TS showed higher levels

compared to all groups. The lowest CD64 value was observed in viral infections. The CD64
indirectly reflect cytokine expression and activation. As shown in Figure 2 the CD64 levels are
higher in PIMS-TS than in severe bacterial infections and KD. This CD64 expression affects
monocytes and neutrophils and may inform about the hyperinflammatory status in PIMS-TS[7,8].
Compared to KD we observed differences in monocytes but not in neutrophils. The study of CD64
and CD11a expression in these leukocytes could help in the differential diagnosis of PIMS-TS as
is explained in Figure 2.
To study the proteins involved in leukocyte tissue migration, we examined the percentage of CD11a
and CD11b positive cells. In our series, we observed that both proteins were higher in neutrophils
and monocytes than in viral or bacterial infections (Figure 1). Also, they were higher than KD but
without differences. Related to CD11a, the MFI was also higher in neutrophils of PIMS-TS cases.
In adults, the inflammation in the basis of SARS-CoV-2 showed a predominant presence of
macrophages and neutrophils in the affected territory. In PIMS-TS this increased CD11a
expression could be a sign of the activation and trafficking of these leukocytes. These findings,
added to the previously commented, are congruent with an inflammatory process and the trend of
these cells to leave the bloodstream. This supports the inflammatory clinical findings but also
confirm the utility of anti-inflammatory drugs as a cornerstone in the management of these
children[10-13].
This work has limitations. We observed age differences between the groups analyzed (Table 1).
The distribution of leukocyte populations is influenced by this. Despite this, we observed internal
homogeneity between groups, which strengthens the observations. Also, the expression of CD64,
CD11a and CD11b did not show correlations with age or differences by sex. Finally, the possible
relationship between the observed data and the PIMS-TS clinical courses were not studied. This
was not the aim of this work and should be considered in future works.

In conclusion, we compare for the first time the innate cellular response of children with PIMS-TS
with other severe forms of viral or bacterial infection. Also, we describe differences with children
with KD. Our findings define a differential cell innate signature with consistent data related to the
possible presence of inflammation and immune dysregulation. These data should be further studied
and may facilitate the diagnosis and management of these patients.
