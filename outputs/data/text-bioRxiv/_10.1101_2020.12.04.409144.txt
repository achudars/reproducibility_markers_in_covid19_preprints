Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes the cardiovascular complications in
addition to respiratory disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs endothelial function and induces
vascular inflammation, leading to endotheliitis. SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on the binding of
Spike glycoprotein (S protein) to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the host cells. We
show here that S protein alone can damage vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro and in vivo,
manifested by impaired mitochondrial function, decreased ACE2 expression and eNOS activity,
and increased glycolysis. The underlying mechanism involves S protein downregulation of AMPK
and upregulation of MDM2, causing ACE2 destabilization. Thus, the S protein-exerted vascular
endothelial damage via ACE2 downregulation overrides the decreased virus infectivity.

Clinical data from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) underscore the cardiovascular
complications in addition to respiratory disease involved in this deadly disease. SARS-CoV-2
infection relies on the binding of Spike glycoprotein (S protein) to angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) in the host cells. Vascular endothelium is a key tissue infected and damaged by SARSCoV-2.1 SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers mitochondrial ROS production and promotes glycolytic
shift.2 Paradoxically, ACE2 exerts a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, and SARSCoV-1 S protein has been shown to promote lung injury by decreasing the level of ACE2 in the
infected lungs.3 In the current study, we show that S protein alone can damage vascular endothelial
cells (ECs) by downregulating ACE2 and consequently inhibiting mitochondrial function.
To examine whether S protein causes lung damage in the infected host, we administered a
pseudovirus expressing S protein (Pseu-Spike) to hamsters intratracheally. Lung damage was
apparent in animals receiving Pseu-Spike, revealed by thickening of the alveolar septa and
increased infiltration of mononuclear cells (Figure 1A). AMPK phosphorylates ACE2 Ser-680,
MDM2 ubiquitinates ACE2 Lys-788, and crosstalk between AMPK and MDM2 determines the
ACE2 expression level.4 In the damaged lungs, levels of phospho-AMPK (pAMPK), phosphoACE2 (pACE2), and ACE2 decreased but those of MDM2 increased (Figure 1Ba). Furthermore,
complementary increased and decreased phosphorylation of eNOS Thr-494 and Ser-1176
indicated impaired eNOS activity. These changes of pACE2/ACE2 and MDM2 expression and
AMPK activity in the endothelium by S protein were recapitulated by in vitro experiments using
cultured pulmonary arterial ECs (PAECs) infected with Pseu-Spike which was rescued by
treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), the ROS inhibitor (Figure 1Bb).
Since mitochondrial homeostasis has a profound effect on EC function, we next studied
the impact of S protein on mitochondrial function. Double-blind analysis of confocal images of

ECs treated with S1 protein revealed increased mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating altered
mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 1Ca). To examine whether these changes in mitochondrial
morphology were due, in part, to the decreased amount of ACE2, we overexpressed ACE2 S680D
(ACE2-D, a phospho-mimetic ACE2 with increased stability) or S680L (ACE2-L, a dephosphomimetic with decreased stability)4 in ECs. As shown in Figure 1Cb, ECs with ACE2-L
overexpression had a higher number of fragmented mitochondria when compared to those with
ACE2-D. Next, we performed Seahorse Flux analysis to compare the effect of ACE2-D versus
ACE2-L on mitochondrial function. Seahorse Flux analysis showed ECs overexpressing ACE2-L
had reduced basal mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiration compared
to ECs overexpressing ACE2-D (Figure 1Da). Moreover, ACE2-L overexpression caused
increased basal acidification rate, glucose-induced glycolysis, maximal glycolytic capacity, and
glycolytic reserve (Figure 1Db). To explore the molecular basis underlying ACE2 regulation of
mitochondrial and glycolytic alterations, we assessed the expression levels of mitochondria- and
glycolysis-related genes in lung ECs isolated from ACE2-D or ACE2-L knock-in mice4. As shown
in Figure 1E, the mRNA levels of NRF1, HO1, and TFAM (mitochondria biogenesis related genes)
were increased, whereas those of HK2, PFKFB3, and ENO2 (glycolysis related genes) were
decreased in the lung ECs in ACE2-D mice, as compared with those in ACE2-L mice.
SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs EC function and induces inflammation, leading to
endotheliitis.1,5 Because S protein decreased the level of ACE2 and impaired eNOS derived-NO
bioavailability, we examined whether S protein entry is indispensable for dysfunctional
endothelium in vivo. As shown in Figure 1Fa, the endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by
acetylcholine (ACh) was impaired in pulmonary arteries isolated from Pseu-Spike-administered
hamsters, whereas the endothelium-independent vasodilation induced by sodium nitroprusside

(SNP) was not affected by Pseu-Spike. To further confirm that EC-dependent vasodilation is
correlated with ACE2 expression level, we compared the ACh- and SNP-induced vasodilation of
pulmonary vessels from ACE2-D or ACE2-L mice. As anticipated, ACh-induced vasodilation was
significantly hindered in pulmonary arteries isolated from ACE2-L mice in comparison to ACE2D mice (Figure 1Fb). There was, however, no difference of SNP-induced vasodilation in ACE2D and ACE-L animals.
Our data herein reveals that S protein alone can damage endothelium, manifested by
impaired mitochondrial function and eNOS activity but increased glycolysis. The S proteinmediated endothelial impairment depends on ACE2 post-translational modifications. It appears
that S protein in ECs increases redox stress which may lead to AMPK deactivation, MDM2
upregulation, and ultimately ACE2 destabilization.4 It seems paradoxical that ACE2 reduction by
S protein would decrease the virus infectivity, thereby protecting endothelium. However, a
dysregulated renin-angiotensin system due to ACE2 reduction may exacerbate endothelial
dysfunction, leading to endotheliitis. Collectively, our results suggest that the S protein-exerted
EC damage overrides the decreased virus infectivity. This conclusion suggests that vaccinationgenerated antibody and/or exogenous antibody against S protein not only protects the host from
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity but also inhibits S protein-imposed endothelial injury and ultimately
decrease cardiovascular complication-associated mortality in COVID-19 patients.
