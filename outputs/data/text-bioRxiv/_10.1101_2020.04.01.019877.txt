Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine
is urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising
platform for vaccination. Here, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions
(UTRs) of mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive
analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified the
optimal combination of 5’ and 3’ UTR, termed as NASAR, which was five to ten-fold more
efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered
by lipid-derived nanoparticles showed dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2
antigens both in vitro and in vivo. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as
alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, is causing a global pandemic, leading to over 900,000
confirmed cases and 45,000 death as of April 1, 20201. SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% sequence
identity with SARS-CoV and infects host cells through the receptor of angiotensinconverting enzyme 22. To counteract this severe viral infection, a wide variety of
therapeutics are in preclinical and clinical studies3 . Currently, there is no FDA-approved
treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Vaccine is the most effective strategy to prevent viral infections for a large population4.
Different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines such as mRNA, DNA, and recombinant proteinbased antigens are currently in clinical trials5. Among these agents, mRNA-based vaccine
candidates first entered the clinical trial, because of the fast process for developing and
manufacturing mRNA6. To express an antigen effectively, an mRNA requires several
essential components, including 5’ cap, 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR), antigen-encoding
sequence, 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR), and polyadenylated tail7. Among these
components, the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR are unique regulators for protein translation8. The
design and selection of 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR are critically important to ensure the sufficient
production of antigens and efficacious vaccination of the host 9. Therefore, systematic
explorations of UTRs may provide broad applicability for mRNA vaccines in response to
emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies utilized many UTRs from
endogenous genes for protein expression8, 10, 11. For example, the UTRs from human
cytochrome B-245 alpha polypeptide (CYBA) outperformed several other UTRs for
protein expression12. The 5’ UTR from alpha globin mRNA enabled higher translation
efficiency than that from beta globin mRNA in cells13. Alternatively, UTRs can be
designed via a de novo method. A recent study reported a series of 5’UTRs consisting of
12-14 nucleotides (nt)14. Also, a deep learning method was applied to screen and analyze
a large set of 5’UTRs15. Based on these significant advances, we hypothesize that the
integration of endogenous UTRs with further de novo design may be a superior approach
for UTRs engineering, facilitating the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Fig. 1). Our
results prove the concept of this approach and significantly increase protein production
compared to the UTRs reported in the literatures12, 16-18. Lastly, a series of potential SARSCoV-2 antigens are visualized via fluorescent imaging in both cell and animal models,
which may serve as vaccine candidates for the clinical trials.

Results
Investigation of endogenous 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR
Endogenous 5’ UTR from bioinformatics analysis
To screen endogenous UTRs in mammalian cells, we utilized a bioinformatics analysis of
global gene expression as a starting point. Previously, the average half-life (h) and
translation rate constant [protein copy number/(mRNA×h)] of 4248 mRNAs and
corresponding proteins were quantified in mammalian cells19. According to their data, we
calculated the translation capacity per mRNA molecule using the following equation:
average half-life (h) × translation rate constant [protein copy number/(mRNA×h)] × protein
length (amino acids) = translation capacity per mRNA molecule (total amino acids/mRNA)
(Supplementary Table 1). These results indicated the number of amino acids produced
by a single mRNA during its half-life. The mRNA from the murine Rps27a gene was found
to possess the highest translation capacity per mRNA molecule. Rps27a is a housekeeping
gene that encodes one of the components of the ribosome 40S subunit 20. Two proteincoding transcripts exist for the murine Rps27a gene (named S27a-44 and S27a-45). These
two transcripts have different 5’ UTRs and share the same 3’ UTR (Supplementary Table
2 and Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, we generated two mRNAs utilizing S27a-45
and S27a-44 5’ UTRs, respectively. In these two 5’ UTRs, we found putative terminal
oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) motifs consisting of 4-15 clustered pyrimidines (C and U), which
were reported to negatively regulate mRNA translation (Supplementary Table 2)21.
Subsequently, we removed the TOP motifs from S27a-44 and S27a-45 5’ UTRs and
constructed two additional 5’ UTRs: S27a-44’ and S27a-45’. The mRNAs encoding Firefly
luciferase were synthesized with these 5’ UTRs and were delivered to Hep3B and 293T
cells using lipofectamine 3000. The control UTRs include CYBA UTRs (named CYBA)12,
alpha globin UTRs (named AG)13, and modified alpha globin UTRs (AG+G with a
complete Kozak sequence and 5AG+G without 3’ UTR)18. 5’ UTR from S27a-44 was
better than that from S27a-45 (Fig. 2a). Removal of the putative TOP motif from S27a-45
moderately improved expression, while S27a-44’ without the TOP motif increased the

relative luciferase activity over 70% compared to the S27a-44 in the two cell lines. S27a44’ was comparable to CYBA and AG+G, the two best controls (Fig. 2a).
Comparison study of endogenous 3’ UTR
We next compared 3’ UTR of the S27a with three alternative UTRs. Two 3’ UTRs were
obtained from the mRNAs of transferrin (TF) and α-1-antitrypsin (AAT), two abundant
human plasma proteins22. Another 3’ UTR from Hepatitis C viral RNA (HCV) was
reported to retain and recycle the 40S subunit of ribosome after translation termination at
stop codon, accelerating re-initiation of translation23. We then constructed these 3’ UTRs
with the same 5’ UTR. As shown in Fig. 2b, these UTRs displayed similar effects on
luciferase expression. Additionally, replacing S27a 3’UTR with another unstructured 3’
UTR of the same length significantly decreased protein expression (Supplementary Table
3 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Since the length of S27a 3’ UTR (34nt) was considerably
shorter than other 3’ UTRs (AAT 100nt, TF 386nt, or HCV 190nt), S27a 3’ UTR was used
in the following studies.

De novo design and optimization of 5’ UTR
Explorations of 5’ UTR length
Besides utilizing UTRs derived from endogenous genes, one alternative approach is to
design mRNA UTRs via a de novo method, which is widely applied in protein
engineering24. During the process of de novo design for UTRs, several general principles
can be considered. For example, the Kozak sequence (GCCACC) located directly upstream
of the translation start codon (AUG) can be included because it is a conserved sequence
among many mammalian mRNAs for accurate start codon recognition25. Second, AUG
within 5’ UTR is excluded to avoid alternative translation initiation and mutation of the

amino acid sequence10. Third, secondary structures may be minimized to reduce the energy
barriers for smooth scanning of the translation initiation complex along the 5’ UTR13, 26.
Based on the knowledge in the literature, we designed 5’ UTR of different length: 10nt, 30,
50nt, 70nt, and 90nt with minimal secondary structures as modeled by RNAfold, a wellestablished computational tool for the prediction of RNA secondary structures
(Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). We then prepared the mRNAs
and evaluated their luciferase expression as mentioned above. The results showed that
relative luciferase activity increased with 5’ UTR length and peaked at 70nt (Fig. 3a).
Further increase of the length lowered luciferase expression. Therefore, 70nt was used as
the optimal length for the subsequent design of 5’UTRs.
Nucleotide composition analysis of 5’ UTR
In addition to length, nucleotide compositions of A, C, G, and U may be an important factor
at the 5’ UTR. Generally, high GC content is commonly associated with increased
structural complexity27. G can base pair with both C and U and induce the formation of
more secondary structures27. The increase of U content may introduce additional
chemically modified nucleotides into 5’ UTR if modified U, such as pseudouridine are
used in mRNA synthesis. To understand the effects of nucleotide compositions, we
performed nucleotide compositions analysis and designed a series of 5’ UTRs (NCA-1 to
NCA-8). When adjusting nucleotide composition, the minimal numbers of G and C are 3
and 4, respectively, due to the transcription start site determined by the T7 promoter
sequence (GG) and the use of Kozak sequence (GCCACC). These 5’ UTRs were also built
to avoid secondary structures (Supplementary Fig. 2b), thereby minimizing the impact of
structures on translation initiation. As shown in Fig. 3b, a decrease of relative luciferase
activity was observed with less A and more G when the amount of C and U were constant
(NCA-1 vs NCA-2; NCA-1 vs NCA-3). When G and U were minimal, the increase of C
and decrease of A content showed a moderate decrease of luciferase expression (NCA-3
vs NCA-4). When holding G content to the minimal of 3, the inclusion of U boosted
relative luciferase activity (NCA-5 vs NCA-6 vs NCA-7 vs NCA-8). Moreover, these 5’
UTR with ACU outperformed those consisting of mostly AC and AG, suggesting the
importance of U on 5’ UTR. Consequently, two constructs with high U contents, NCA-7
and NCA-8, were selected for further studies.
Removal of microRNA target sites from 5’ UTR
MicroRNAs were previously considered to mainly target the 3’ UTR of mRNA for gene
regulations28. However, recent data showed that miRNAs also interfered with ribosomal
scanning by binding to target sites within 5’ UTR29. Hence, we examined possible miRNA
target sites within NCA-7 and NCA-8 using the prediction tool available at miRDB. The
prediction exhibited that both NCA-7 and NCA-8 contained miRNA target sites
(Supplementary Table 2). Then, we adjusted the order of the nucleotides of NCA-7 and
NCA-8 and created NCA-7d and NCA-8d, which maintain their nucleotide compositions
with minimal secondary structure. Interestingly, NCA-7d showed a slightly increased

expression than NCA-7, while NCA-8d was less active than NCA-8 (Fig. 3c). Based on
these results, NCA-7d was selected as the lead 5’ UTR.

Optimization of 3’ UTR with integrated motifs

Next, we further studied the effects of functional motifs integrated with the lead S27a 3’
UTR. Previous studies reported that abundant cis-regulatory elements existed in mRNA 3’
UTR to modulate protein expression, such as functional motifs for RNA binding proteins
(RBPs)11. Specific RBPs are able to bind to their cognate motifs within mRNA 3’ UTR
and enhance protein expression through various mechanisms30. One of the RBPs, QKI-7,
was shown to enable cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA and upregulation of protein
expression after binding to its target motif called QKI Response Element (QRE) in 3’
UTR31. Two QRE sequences were obtained from previous reports, namely QRE1 32 and
QRE233. Another RBP, HuR, was believed to stabilize target transcripts by binding to its
cognate motifs called AU-Rich Element (ARE) in eukaryotic cells34. One such ARE
sequence was obtained from human eIF4E mRNA 3’ UTR34. Besides eukaryotic mRNA,
the sindbis virus (SinV) evolved to utilize part of its viral 3’ UTR to recruit HuR and induce
potent stabilization of the viral RNA genome35. The SinV RNA regions responsible for
HuR binding, including repeated sequence element 3 and U-rich element (together named
R3U) was obtained. Additionally, the ribosome binding fragments from two internal
ribosome entry sites (IRESs) of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)36 and foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV)37 were selected. These two fragments possess high binding
affinities to ribosomal subunits and have the potential to retain and recycle the subunits for
more efficient translation re-initiation. Based on these literature findings, we prepared
mRNA transcripts with the integration of the following elements after S27a 3’ UTR: QRE1,
QRE2, R3U, ARE, EMCV, and FMDV (Supplementary Table 3). R3U was identified as
a preferred functional motif from the results in both Hep3B and 293T cells (Fig. 4a).
Through the comprehensive UTR engineering, the optimal UTRs was identified as NCA7d as the 5’ UTR and S27a plus a functional motif R3U as the 3’ UTR (named as NASAR).
After several rounds of design and validation of UTRs, we then compared NASAR with
S27a-45, the starting point of endogenous gene together with two additional control UTRs
(MOD1 and MOD2) in the literature16, 17. NASAR was over 10-fold more potent than S27a45, 4 to 7-fold better than CYBA or AG+G, and up to 2-fold superior to MOD1 and MOD2
in cell lines and primary cells (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3). These results
demonstrate that our concept, integration of endogenous UTRs with further de novo design,
is an efficient strategy for UTRs design.

NASAR mRNAs express SARS-CoV-2 antigens
Given the potent activity of NASAR mRNAs and urgent demand for SARS-CoV-2
vaccines, we aim to create NASAR mRNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 antigens. According
to previous studies on SARS-CoV, its structural spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins,
regarded as the dominant antigens eliciting neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV patients,
were explored as vaccine candidates38, 39. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S
protein responsible for viral entry was also utilized for vaccine development 38. The
membrane (M) protein contained epitopes40. Additionally, the envelope (E) protein
interacting with M was indispensable for the assembly of viral particles41. Therefore, five
NASAR mRNAs were prepared to express RBD, S, N, M, and E proteins as the vaccine
candidates. Since no antibodies have been developed against these five potential antigens
in SARS-CoV-2, we installed a FLAG tag to RBD andS protein , and a VSV-G tag to N,
M, and E proteins in order to detect their expression. To confirm the effects of UTRs on
antigen expression using NASAR mRNA vaccine, three additional mRNAs were
synthesized using the coding sequence of RBD with control UTRs, CYBA, MOD2, and
NASAR. After the delivery of these three mRNAs into 293T cells using our previously
developed lipid like-nanoparticles, TT342, RBD expression was analyzed by an ELISA.
NASAR enabled antigen expression 3-fold of CYBA and 1.6-fold of MOD2 (Fig. 5a),
consistent with the luciferase expression results in Fig. 4c. Then, NASAR mRNAs
encoding all five SARS-CoV-2 antigens were delivered to 293T cells by TT3 separately.
We observed the obvious expression of these antigens through immunostaining (Fig. 5b,
Supplementary Fig. 4).
Based on the encouraging cell results, we performed intramuscular (i.m.) injection,
a widely used administration route for vaccines43, of NASAR mRNAs. Similar to in vitro
results, NASAR was 4.2-fold more potent than CYBA in the luciferase expression when
both were delivered by TT3 nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, TT3
nanoparticles induced over 70-fold more luciferase activity than MC3 nanoparticles, an
FDA-approved delivery vehicle44, 45, when formulated with the same NASAR mRNAs (Fig.
5c). Lastly, NASAR mRNAs encoding either RBD or S protein were formulated with TT3
and injected intramuscularly into hind legs of mice. Confocal microscopy imaging of the
mouse tissues with immunostaining confirmed the expression of both antigens (Fig. 5d).

Discussion
This study describes a rational engineering approach to enhance protein production using
mRNA. Through bioinformatics analysis and modification of endogenous 5’ UTR and 3’
UTR, followed by de novo design and further optimization, the most effective NASAR
UTR was identified, enabling strong expression of multiple potential SARS-CoV-2
antigens both in vitro and in vivo.
Based on this study, several criteria should be considered in the design of mRNA UTRs:
(1). Regarding the 5’ UTR, the length is critical and the optimal sequences tested in this
work do not exceed 70nt. And it should be free of certain regulatory elements, e.g. TOP
motifs, secondary structure, upstream open reading frame, and microRNA binding site. (2).
In terms of 3’ UTR, secondary structures may benefit protein production. A plausible
explanation is that such structure in 3’ UTR might prevent ribosome from skipping the stop
codon and reaching mRNA 3’ end that triggers Non-Stop mRNA Decay (NSD)46. Long 3’
UTR length does not necessarily provide additional translation benefits. Long 3’ UTR
typically contains a mixture of positive and negative cis-regulatory elements11. Although
it is challenging to obtain a long endogenous 3’ UTR with only positive elements, specific
positive cis-regulatory motifs in 3’ UTRs may be used to improve mRNA translation. R3U,
a HuR binding motif added to 3’ UTR, enhanced protein expression, consistent with the
observation in their natural context 34, 35. This indicates that certain positive cis-regulatory
elements may be used as an important UTR component.

In order to cope with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, NASAR mRNAs can be applied
to encode various SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Importantly, TT3 formulated NASAR Fluc
mRNA was much more efficient for than an FDA-approved delivery system MC3. This
enables us to combine the strength of NASAR mRNAs and TT3 nanoparticles to maximize
the expression of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Overall, this work provides a proof-of-concept
study to develop mRNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, which may be
conducive to clinical translations.

Methods
Chemicals and reagents
Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Cell
culture plates and luminescent assay plates were obtained from Corning. MC3 was
purchased from MedKoo. DOPE and DMG-PEG2000 were purchased from Avanti Polar
Lipids. Cholesterol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Q5 High-Fidelity PCR Kit was
purchased from NEB.

De novo design of 5’ UTR
5’ UTRs were designed de novo using AntaRNA (http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de) 47
with predefined nucleotide composition as the sequence constrain and minimal secondary
structure as the structural constrain. GU base pairs were permitted. The secondary structure
of the output sequences was further confirmed by RNAfold (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgibin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). Sequences with undesired secondary structures were
discarded. The microRNA binding sites within 5’ UTR were predicted using the custom
prediction tool in the microRNA database (miRDB) (http://mirdb.org/)48. Due to the
minimum size limit of 100nt for mRNA target submission, the full 5’ UTR and first 100
nucleotides of the firefly luciferase coding region were used as the input sequences.

Plasmid construction
The sequences necessary for in vitro transcription of mRNA, including T7 promoter, 5’
UTR, coding sequence, and 3’ UTR, were cloned into pUC19 vector using repliQa HiFi
Assembly Mix (QuantaBio) and transformed into 5-alpha Competent E. coli (NEB) by
chemical transformation. The transformed E. coli was allowed to grow on LB broth (Miller)
plate with agar and 100ug/mL carbenicillin (Teknova). Individual colonies were inoculated
and outgrown in LB broth liquid medium (Miller) containing 100ug/mL carbenicillin
overnight with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm. Plasmids were extracted using QIAprep Spin
Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Concentration was measured on a NanoDrop 2000
Spectrophotometer (Thermo). The region of interest in the plasmid from the T7 promoter
to 3’ UTR was confirmed by Sanger Sequencing.

mRNA synthesis
All mRNA transcripts were synthesized by in vitro transcription using a protocol modified
from our previous publication49. Briefly, DNA templates were synthesized by PCR
amplification of the corresponding plasmids using a forward primer and a reverse primer
containing 120T at 5’ end. The DNA templates were purified by QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen) and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. All mRNAs were
synthesized by in vitro transcription with 100% substitution of UTP by pseudouridine-5'triphosphate (TriLink) using AmpliScribe T7-Flash Transcription Kit (Lucigen) following
the manufacturer’s instruction and purified by RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo). The
capping of mRNA was conducted using Vaccinia Capping System (NEB) and Cap 2´-OMethyltransferase (NEB), followed by another purification by RNA Clean & Concentrator
(Zymo). After measurement of concentration by a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo), all mRNAs were diluted to the desired concentration in 1× TE, aliquoted, and
stored at -80°C for future use.

Firefly luciferase assay in vitro
Hep3B and 293T cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (Corning)
with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Corning)
with 10% FBS, respectively. Hep3B and 293T cells were seeded at a density of 2×104
cells/well on a white 96-well flat-bottom plate (Costar) followed by overnight incubation.
The mRNAs were thawed on ice and denatured at 65°C for 3min followed by incubation
at room temperature for 45min. When Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo) was used, the
transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction. When TT3
nanoparticles was used, mRNA was formulated using lipid:DOPE:cholesterol:DMGPEG2000 at a molar ratio of 20:30:40:0.75 as reported before. 42 Then, cells in each well
were treated with 50 ng per well of Firefly luciferase mRNA. The luminescence activity
was determined on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Biotek) using a BrightGlo Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega).

Quantification of RBD levels with ELISA
1 × 105 293T cells were seeded in each well in a 24-well plate and grew overnight. The
cells were treated with 100 ng per well mRNAs encoding the RBD antigen using TT3
nanoparticles as mentioned above. After overnight incubation, cells were lysed in each well.
The cell lysis was retrieved and centrifuged at 12000×rpm for 10min. EZview Red ANTIFLAG M2 Affinity Gel was used to concentrate the FLAG-tagged RBD in the pellet
following the manufacturer’s protocol. RBD was eluted into 0.1M glycine HCl at pH 3.5
and diluted 10 times before coating a 96-well immunoplate (Thermo/Nunc). After blocking,
primary rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (ab1162, abcam) at 1:1000 dilution was added,

reading was obtained on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Biotek).

Immunostaining and microscopy imaging
293T cells were grown overnight on cover slides placed in a 6-well plate. TT3
nanoparticles were formulated with mRNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 antigens, S, RBD, M,
N, and E proteins, as described above. Six hours after treatment, cells were washed with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 10% formalin, followed by
permeabilization with 0.2% Tween-20. Staining was conducted using primary rabbit antiFLAG antibody (abcam, ab1162) at 1:200 dilution and FITC-linked secondary goat antirabbit polyclonal antibody (abcam, ab6717) at 1:1000 dilution. Nucleus was stained with
Hoechst 33342 (Thermo). After sealing the slides, images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse
Ti Inverted Fluorescence Phase Contrast Microscope with NIS-Elements BR imaging
software (version 4.20).

Luciferase expression assay in vivo
All mouse studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
The Ohio State University and complied with local, state, and federal regulations. mRNA
encoding Firefly luciferase was formulated at the concentration of 0.03 mg/mL using TT3
nanoparticlesand dialyzed in 1×PBS. Three mice per group were injected intramuscularly
15 µg mRNA per leg (n=6 legs). Six hours after injection, mice were imaged using a
Xenogen IVIS Spectrum In Vivo imaging system (Caliper)

SARS-CoV-2 antigens expression in vivo
The mRNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RBD and S, were formulated by TT3
nanoparticles to 0.03 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. The formulated nanoparticles
were dialyzed in 1×PBS. The formulation was injected intramuscularly 15µg RBDencoding mRNA or 30µg S-encoding mRNA. Mice were euthanized six hours after
injection. The muscle tissue at the injection sites was harvested and incubated in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight, followed by 30% sucrose incubation overnight. The tissue
was sectioned using Cryotome E Cryostat (Thermo-Shandon) and fixed using acetone. The
subsequent staining procedure was the same as that for staining 293T cells. Images were
taken on a Nikon A1R Live Cell Confocal microscope with NIS-Elements BR imaging
software (version 4.20).
