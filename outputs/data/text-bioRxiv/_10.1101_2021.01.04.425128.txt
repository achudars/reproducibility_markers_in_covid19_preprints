Abstract
Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) decoy receptors are promising agents to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as they are
not affected by common escape mutations in viral proteins. However, their success may be limited
by their relatively poor potency. To address these challenges, we developed a highly active
multimeric sACE2 decoy receptor via a SunTag system that could neutralize both pseudoviruses
bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates. This fusion protein
demonstrated a neutralization efficiency nearly 250-fold greater than monomeric sACE2. SunTag
in combination with a more potent version of sACE2 achieved near complete neutralization at a
sub-nanomolar range, which is comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate
that this activity is due to greater occupancy of the multimeric decoy receptors on Spike protein as
compared to monomeric sACE2. Overall, these highly potent multimeric sACE2 decoy receptors
offer a promising treatment approach against SARS-CoV-2 infections including its novel variants.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). It was firstly diagnosed in late 2019 in Wuhan, China (2) and
has since spread over the globe, leading the WHO to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (3).
As of January 2, 2021, there have been more than 84 million reported cases of COVID-19, that
have caused more than 1.8 million reported deaths worldwide (4). Several vaccine candidates have
been developed in a remarkably short period of time and shown to be highly effective in phase III
clinical trials (5–8). Despite these promising results, producing vaccines in sufficient amounts and
distributing them worldwide to stop the disease is likely to be a very long and challenging process.
There is also no evidence as of yet that the available vaccines will provide long-term protection,
or protection against potential novel variants of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, novel drugs targeting
SARS-CoV-2 specifically, and all of its possible variants, are needed to provide a reliable and
effective therapy for this disease.
Currently, viral replication inhibitors such as remdesivir or favipiravir, which were initially
developed for Ebola or influenza, respectively, are regarded as a standard of care in the treatment
of COVID-19 (9, 10). However, clinical trials indicated little or no effect of these drugs especially
for patients with severe symptoms (11, 12). Although there are numerous ongoing studies and
clinical trials, drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.

To date, the only cell surface receptor shown to be responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection is
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (13–18). Upon binding to this protein, SARS-CoV-2
enters cells via cleavage of its spike glycoprotein by either membrane proteases such as TMPRSS2,
or endosomal proteases such as cathepsin B/L (17). Camostat mesylate, which inhibits TMPRSS2,
and E64d, which inhibits cathepsin B/L proteases, were also found to be effective to neutralize
virus (17). Accordingly, inhibitions of these pathways were offered to block virus entry, and their
efficacy is being tested in clinical trials (19). Natural or synthetic antibodies against ACE2 (20–
25) or SARS-CoV-2 Spike (26), have been developed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding to
cellular ACE2. However, many viruses including SARS-CoV-2 were shown to acquire escape
mutations under such evolutionary pressure (27). Therefore, soluble ACE2 and its more potent
mutant forms have been proposed as alternatives to neutralizing antibodies (28–30) as the virus
cannot develop resistance without compromising cell entry. Soluble ACE2 was shown to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture experiments (31), in vitro human organoids (31), and
recently on a COVID-19 patient with severe symptoms (32). However, sACE2 is not evolved to
be the natural receptor of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. For this reason, it has to be used in high
concentrations in order to achieve sufficient levels of neutralization.
To address this challenge, we aimed to increase neutralization efficiency by fusing alternative
protein domains with soluble ACE2 (sACE2) (Figure 1A and Figure S1). We explored several
different strategies including SARS-CoV-2 co-targeting and protein multimerization. In these
fusion proteins, we utilized either the wild type sACE2(WT), or its mutant form, sACE2(v1),
which binds SARS-CoV-2 Spike with higher affinity (28). For our co-targeting proteins, we fused
the extracellular domains of PAI1/SERPINE1 or A1AT/SERPINA1, known TMPRSS2 inhibitors
(33), with the C terminus of sACE2 via a GS rich linker (Figure 1A). Similarly, we fused the
extracellular domain of cystatin C/CST3, which was shown to inhibit cathepsin B/L in the
endosomal pathway (34, 35), with sACE2 (Figure 1A). Finally, we hypothesized that
multimerization of sACE2 would more closely mimic the physiological protein concentrations
found on cells and could potentially block viral cell entry more effectively than the soluble sACE2.
To test this, we utilized a multimerization system called SunTag, which was originally developed
for signal amplification in fluorescence imaging (36). This system consists of two tags; a small
GCN4 domain, a transcription factor found in yeast, and a scFv domain that is specific to the
GCN4 tag (Figure 1A). In the original SunTag study, the authors had used up to 24xGCN4 tags

to allow recruitment of 24 copies of GFP. However, as sACE2 is significantly larger than GFP,
we instead used a 5xGCN4 tag, which had been incorporated in a dCas9-based gene activation
system to recruit 5 copies of TET1, a similarly sized protein to sACE2 (37). In our constructs, we
separately incorporated both the 5xGCN4 and scFv tags to sACE2. Using both components
together, we expected that sACE2 would be multimerized with these tags and bind to the multiple
Spike proteins. Therefore, achieving higher neutralization levels would be possible by increasing
the sACE2 presence on the SARS-CoV-2 virion.
To test the neutralization efficiencies of designed constructs in a BSL-2 level laboratory, we
generated lentiviral-based pseudotyped viruses containing a SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and
a GFP or luciferase transfer plasmids to measure cellular infection. These Spike-bearing
pseudoviruses were then used to infect HEK293T cells transiently expressing ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. In parallel with the findings of Hoffmann et al. (2020) (17), cells co-expressing both
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were infected much more efficiently by Spike-bearing pseudoviruses,
compared to cells expressing them individually (Figure S2A and S2C). This phenotype was also
confirmed with fLuc packaged Spike-bearing pseudoviruses (Figure S2E). Interestingly, the
relative infection efficiency was not significantly different with VSVG-bearing pseudoviruses
(Figure S2B and S2D). We also compared two different codon optimized Spike constructs when
generating pseudoviruses, including the full-length version or 18-aa truncated version. The
infection rate was nearly 6 times higher with the 18-aa truncated Spike (Figure S2C).
Demonstrating the specificity of this model, pseudovirus infection was blocked with recombinant
ACE2 protein (Figure S2F). Encouraged by these results, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing
cells, and pseudoviruses bearing 18-aa truncated Spike were used for further experiments.
Following the cloning of our fusion proteins, we expressed them in HEK293T cells. As all fused
proteins have sACE2 in their N termini, they were secreted into the culture media. Assuming a
similar expression for all constructs, we collected serum-free conditioned media (CM) and
performed a small screen to test for pseudovirus neutralization (Figure 1B). Cell infection of the
GFP encoding pseudoviruses were initially confirmed by microscopy and then quantified by a
fluorescent plate reader (Figure S3A), while fLuc-encoding pseudoviruses were quantified by a
luminescence assay (Figure S3C). From this initial screen, we observed that sACE2(WT) did not
significantly impact pseudovirus neutralization. However, similar to findings of Chan et al. (28,

30), sACE2(v1) including H34A, T92Q, Q325P, A386L mutations, could significantly inhibit the
cell entry of pseudoviruses. The CST3 and A1AT fusions slightly increased the effects of both
sACE2(WT) and sACE2(v1). As they were not strongly effective individually (Figure S3B), we
conclude that fusion with sACE2 might enhance their activity by bringing them closer to their
target enzymes. However, the most striking results were obtained with the SunTag system,
particularly when fused with the sACE2(WT). Crude CMs from both sACE2(WT)-SunTag and
sACE2(v1)-SunTag almost completely blocked pseudovirus infection (Figure 1C). As the
individual components, sACE2-5xGCN4 and sACE2-scFvGCN4, had similar activity to the
untagged sACE2, the pseudovirus neutralization occurred through multimerization of sACE2.
Moreover, this result is compatible with the recent studies indicating natural dimerization (28) or
engineered trimerization (29) of sACE2 increased the Spike binding affinity and neutralization
capacity.
As a comparison, we included small molecule inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B/L
(Camostat mesylate and E64d) (17) in our pseudotyped virus neutralization assay. These inhibitors
were effective in the micromolar concentration range as expected. However even at the highest
concentrations (100 µM), they were not as potent as sACE2(WT)-SunTag or sACE2(v1)-SunTag
CM in inhibiting virus entry, attesting to their superior efficacy.
We observed that both sACE2(WT)-SunTag and sACE2(v1)-SunTag CMs blocked more than
90% of pseudovirus infection. To be able to compare the dosage dependency, we next performed
limiting dilution assay (Figure 2A). sACE2v2.4(732) was also added to the dilution assay, as it
was shown to be highly potent against Spike, because of the point mutations and the natural
dimerization domain (28, 30). As expected, without dilution, sACE2v2.4(732) was more effective
than the sACE2(WT) or sACE2(v1) and similar with WT-SunTag and v1-SunTag. However, even
after 5x dilution, it was clear that both WT-SunTag and v1-SunTag neutralized pseudoviruses were
much better than the others and were still effective after 50x dilution (Figure 2A).
To preclude non-specific effects from other secreted proteins present in the conditioned media, we
generated recombinant proteins in vitro using 8xHis tagged WT, WT-SunTag, v1, and v1-SunTag
ACE2 (Figure 2B) followed by fPLC purification. In vitro generated monomeric sACE2(WT),
was shown to have comparable activity (IC50 = 358 ± 114 nM) to commercially available

recombinant sACE2 (IC50 = 275 ± 78 nM) (Figure S2F). In contrast, the sACE2(WT)-SunTag
had more than 250-fold increased neutralization capacity (IC50 = 1.35 ± 0.24 nM) than the
monomeric sACE2(WT). Further, similar to our earlier results, the purified sACE2(v1)-SunTag
was the most efficient system, with a sub-nanomolar median (IC50 = 0.30 ± 0.07 nM) inhibitory
concentration (Figure 2C).
To extend our findings from the pseudotyped virus system to a bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection
system, we carried out neutralization assays with clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in BSL-3
laboratory. Accordingly, both sACE2(WT)-SunTag and sACE2(v1)-SunTag blocked SARS-CoV2 entry to Vero-CCL81 cells much more efficiently than their untagged counterparts (Figure 3A
and Figure S4). sACE2(WT)-SunTag neutralized 105 pfu/ml SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of
2.09 ± 0.45 nM (Figure 3A) and 103 pfu/ml SARS-CoV-2 were neutralized with a sub-nanomolar
IC50 value (0.15 ± 0.04 nM) (Figure 3A). This result indicates that the addition of SunTag allows
the use of wild type ACE2 as a highly efficient trap for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, which
prevents any possibility of escape mutations. Similarly, sACE2(v1)-SunTag neutralized SARSCoV-2 with a sub-nanomolar median inhibitory concentration in both 105 pfu/ml (IC50 = 0.84 ±
0.05 nM) and 103 pfu/ml titers (IC50 = 0.06 ± 0.01 nM) (Figure 3A). These neutralization values
are better than or comparable to several monoclonal antibodies developed in recent studies (20).
From these results, we proposed that the SunTag system blocks SARS-CoV-2 by recruiting
multiple sACE2 more efficiently around the virion (Figure 4B). To test this hypothesis, we
performed a spike binding assay to quantify the relative accumulation of sACE2 on the surface
expressed spike protein (Figure 4A). After tagging sACE2 with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) we
collected CM for each fusion protein and then incubated with spike expressing HEK293T cells
(Figure S5A). Overlay images show that SunTag systems with either WT or v1, clearly enhanced
the spike binding occupancy compared to their untagged partners (Figure 4A). Similar to earlier
work, individual components of the SunTag system, sACE2-5xGCN4 and sACE2-scFvGCN4, did
not demonstrate increased spike binding occupancy (Figure S5B). These data suggest that multiple
sACE2 recruitment around spike proteins provides a much higher binding affinity. It would be
interesting to increase the linker lengths and to use 10x or 24x versions of SunTag and examine if
further enhancement in neutralization would be obtained.

As stability can be a major issue for protein-based drugs, we then tested the impact of storage at
either 4oC for 10 days or 37oC for 24h on pseudovirus neutralization (Figure S6A and S6B).
Although a slight decrease was observed in the neutralization efficiencies after long term storage,
both WT-SunTag and v1-SunTag were more efficient than their untagged counterpart,
demonstrating that these proteins could be amenable to current cold-chain logistics. Interestingly,
the neutralization capacity of both monomeric and multimeric sACE2(v1) was more significantly
affected than sACE2(WT) protein upon storage for 10 days at 4oC (Figure S6A). One of the four
point mutations found in sACE2(v1) (T92Q) disrupts a consensus glycosylation motif formed by
N90 and T92 residues which may lower overall stability (28). This may also be the reason why
bands of v1 variants were slightly lower in SDS-PAGE (Figure 2B). Therefore, using SunTag
with other sACE2 variants (28, 30) protecting the glycosylation motifs may give a better stability,
and even better neutralization efficiency.
On the other hand, using wild type sACE2 while keeping its enzymatic activity at maximum would
have some therapeutic benefits by compensating disturbed ACE2 activity in lungs of infected
patients (38). Moreover, a recent case report showed that sACE2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection
in a severe patient without interfering with the formation of neutralizing antibodies by the patient's
immune system (32, 39). However, wild type sACE2 should be used in very high concentrations
to achieve effective neutralization. Therefore, increasing sACE2 affinity to Spike via the SunTag
system could be a promising strategy for COVID-19 treatment.
Using soluble decoy receptors is an attractive approach to treat SARS-CoV-2. While viruses can
acquire escape mutations to monoclonal antibodies targeting viral proteins like Spike, host cellular
receptors are unlikely to be affected by viral mutations. Therefore, decoy receptors can potentially
overcome common forms of SARS-CoV-2 resistance including the novel variants (39). However,
the initial sACE2 decoy receptors have been limited by relatively poor activity compared to
monoclonal antibodies. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating multiple sACE2 via a
SunTag system can generate a decoy receptor that can effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 cellular
infection. With sACE2(WT), this multimeric decoy receptor was nearly 250-fold more active than
the monomeric protein. Utilizing a mutant sACE2(v1), which has greater affinity for Spike, we
could enhance the neutralization with our multimeric system to comparable levels as Spike
monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical development. This proof-of-principle study utilized a

SunTag approach to generate multimeric decoy receptors but any alternative peptide-scFv couples
could be incorporated with the ACE2. Overall, we believe that highly potent multimeric sACE2
decoy receptors are promising agents, which can be used as a treatment against COVID-19.
