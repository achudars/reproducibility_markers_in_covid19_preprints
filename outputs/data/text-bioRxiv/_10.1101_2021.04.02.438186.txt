Abstract
Epidemiological studies have revealed the emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of
concern (VOC), including the lineage B.1.1.7 that is rapidly replacing old variants. The B.1.1.7
variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates, transmissibility, and potentially mortality (1).
To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune
escape, we conducted infection and re-infection studies in naïve and convalescent Syrian
hamsters (>10 months old). Hamsters infected by either a B.1.1.7 variant or a B.1 (G614) variant
exhibited comparable viral loads and pathology. Convalescent hamsters that were previously
infected by the original D614 variant were protected from disease following B.1.1.7 challenge with
no observable clinical signs or lung pathology. Altogether, our study did not find that the B.1.1.7
variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in hamsters and that natural
infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7
variant.

Introduction

Despite the proofreading activity provided by the 3’-5’ exonuclease activity of non-structural
protein 14, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has accumulated
multiple mutations in its viral genome (2). Mutations occurring in the spike protein are of major
concern due to the role of this glycoprotein in mediating virus entry and as the major target of
neutralizing antibodies (3-6). In March of 2020, the D614G SARS-CoV-2 B.1 variant emerged and
became the predominant strain of virus throughout Europe and the United States (7). Since late
fall 2020, the emergent B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant became predominant in the United Kingdom
and contributed to the December surge in positive SARS-CoV-2 cases and the increase in
hospitalization and death rates (8). Among the 8 mutations found in the spike protein of the
B.1.1.7 variant, the N501Y mutation has been found to increase the binding affinity of spike
protein to the human ACE2 receptor, resulting in an elevated transmissibility and monoclonal
antibody resistance (9-11).

Here, we set out to address whether a prior exposure to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614) isolate
would offer protection against re-infection by a B.1.1.7 variant. In addition, we investigated
whether the B.1.1.7 variant displays fitness advantage over the G614 variant in the Syrian
hamster model.

Results

One group of convalescent (previously infected with Isolate USA-WA1/2020) and one group of
naïve hamsters (n=12 per group, age paired) were intranasally inoculated with 104 plaque forming
units (PFU) of a U.S. B.1.1.7 variant (Isolate CA_CDC_5574/2020, termed CA B.1.1.7). A third
group of 12 naïve hamsters (n=12) were similarly infected with a B.1 variant (Isolate New YorkPV08410/2020, termed NY B.1). The circulating neutralizing antibody titers in the 12

convalescent hamsters ranged from 80 to 320 at the time of challenge. Nasal wash (NW)
samples taken from infected hamsters on days 1, 2 and 3 post infection (PI) showed that all
hamsters contained detectable sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) levels in the nasal cavities on the first
two days PI (Fig.1A). Three days following infection, viral sgRNA levels from nasal washes of
convalescent hamsters declined to below the detection limit, indicating that convalescent
hamsters quickly controlled B.1.1.7 replication. By contrast, naïve hamsters that were challenged
with either the B.1.1.7 or B.1. variant showed 2-3 log10 higher levels of sgRNA compared to the
convalescent group. Furthermore, naïve hamsters that were challenged with the B.1.1.7 variant
displayed overall higher levels of sgRNA in NW samples (statistically significant at the day 2 PI)
than those of the NY B.1 infected group (p=0.0008, 0.01 respectively). The same NW samples
were also quantified for infectivity by an 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) endpoint
dilution assay (Fig. 1B). Only 3 out of 12 NW samples from convalescent hamsters exhibited
detectable levels of infectious virus at the day 1 PI, dropping to below detection at the day 2 PI
(Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, NW samples from NY B.1 infected hamsters contained significantly higher
TCID50 values than those from CA B.1.1.7 infected hamsters on days 2 and 3 PI (p=0.0109,
0.0016 respectively, Fig. 1B).

Convalescent hamsters experienced no weight loss compared to the naïve infected groups over
the course of seven days PI (Fig.1C). Both the CA B.1.1.7 and NY B.1 infected animals lost 1015% of body weight by day 7 PI. At day 7 PI, infected hamster lungs displayed pathology
including alveolar wall thickening, airway infiltrates, perivascular edema and hyperplasia (Fig. 1DE). However, convalescent hamsters who were subsequently re-infected did not show these
signature pathologies in the lungs (Fig. 1E). The cumulative pathology score and percentage of
lung consolidation in the CA B.1.1.7 and NY B.1 naïve groups had no significant difference (Fig.
1D), but both had significantly higher scores than those convalescent hamsters (Fig. 1D).
Therefore, although B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant replication was higher in the nasal cavity on

days 1 and 2 PI compared to the NY B.1 variant measured by sgRNA, the associated pathology
was not more severe in the lung.

To account for the discrepancy between sgRNA titers and TCID50 titers in NW samples, a second
study using ten male Syrian hamsters was subsequently performed. This study included two
convalescent CA B.1.1.7 infected hamsters, four naïve NY B.1 and four naive CA B.1.1.7 infected
Syrian hamsters aged >10 months. Again, NW samples of the CA B.1.1.7 infected hamsters
show overall higher levels of sgRNA, but slightly lower levels of infectious virus than those of NY
B.1 infected animals (Fig. 2A&B). Tissue samples taken from convalescent hamsters at 4 days PI
revealed 3-4 log10 lower levels of sgRNA in all five lobes of the lung, trachea and nasal turbinate
(NT) in comparison to those from naïve hamsters challenged with either the CA B.1.1.7 variant or
the NY B.1 variant (Fig. 2C). Lung and NT homogenates were also titrated by plaque forming
assay in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2D). Homogenates taken from convalescent hamsters contained no
detectable infectious virus at 4 days PI. Interestingly, NY B.1 infected hamsters showed
significantly higher infectious viral titers than CA B.1.1.7 challenged hamsters (Fig. 2D).

Discussion

Altogether, this study finds that 1) convalescent hamsters are protected against interstitial
pneumonia following B.1.1.7 variant challenge and that the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus
does not appear to be more pathogenic in adult male Syrian hamsters when compared to the B.1
variant (D614G). Differences in viral fitness may exist between the B.1.1.7 and B.1 variants in
human beings, however, this was not observed in Syrian hamsters which may not be the ideal
model to assess that possibility. This study did find an increase B.1.1.7 viral replication
concomitant with reduced shedding of infectious virus in NW samples. Such a discrepancy of viral
replication and infectious particles may be attributed to a disadvantaged B.1.1.7 plaquing effect in
Vero E6 cells which has been previously mentioned (12) which would lead to undercounting of

B.1.1.7 variant in Vero E6 cells. To determine whether the B.1.1.7 variant undergoes deleterious
changes in hamsters that would alter the overall infectivity of the virus, we also performed nextgeneration sequencing of 16 hamster NW samples (8 from B.1.1.7 infected and 8 from B.1.
infected hamsters). All sequences remain >99% identity with the sequence of the input virus.
Notably, both the sgRNA and infectious titers of NW samples from the B.1.1.7 infected hamsters
are higher than those of the NY B.1 infected hamsters at the Day 4 PI. This finding may suggest a
prolonged viral shedding of the B.1.1.7, which has been hypothesized to increase the
transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain in the human population (11, 13). However, this study did not
find any increase in pathogenicity of the B.1.1.7 variant in hamsters. The significance of the
increased replication of B.1.1.7 variant in the nasal cavity warrants further exploration through
transmission studies.

collected by pipetting ~200 µl sterile phosphate buffered saline into one nostril. Male hamsters
(n=12) were divided into three groups, the first group contained hamsters who were previously
infected with the USA-WA1/2020 variant (lineage A, GISAID clade S) which was circulating in
Washington State in early 2020. The second group of hamsters were immunologically naïve and
were intranasally infected with the B.1.1.7 variant hCoV-19/USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020 (GISAID
clade GR). The third group of hamsters were challenged with New York-PV08410/2020 (G614,
B.1 lineage, GISAID clade GH). Following infection, hamsters were monitored for clinical signs
and weight loss. Nasal wash samples taken on days 1, 2, and 3 post infection (PI) to test for
sgRNA and TCID50. Seven-days following infection, a subset of hamsters was humanely
euthanized and lungs for histopathology.
