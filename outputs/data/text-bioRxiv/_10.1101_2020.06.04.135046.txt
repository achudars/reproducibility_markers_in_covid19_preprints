Abstract
The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has developed an online open
science data portal for its COVID-19 drug repurposing campaign – named OpenData – with the goal of
making data across a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays available in real-time. The assays developed
cover a wide spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, including both viral and human (host) targets. In
total, over 10,000 compounds are being tested in full concentration-response ranges from across multiple
annotated small molecule libraries, including approved drug, repurposing candidates and experimental
therapeutics designed to modulate a wide range of cellular targets. The goal is to support research
scientists, clinical investigators and public health officials through open data sharing and analysis tools to
expedite the development of SARS-CoV-2 interventions, and to prioritize promising compounds and
repurposed drugs for further development in treating COVID-19.

The pandemic of the atypical pneumonia coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel beta
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has significantly impacted global society, from both an economic and public
health standpoint. As a result, biomedical scientists around the world – from academic and government
laboratories to biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical corporations – have mobilized to understand
the disease, to develop therapeutic interventions to mitigate its impact and to develop protective vaccines.
This rapid research response has resulted in the initiation of repurposing clinical trials for a range of
agents, including three that have received Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) from the Federal Drug
Agency (FDA) in the United States: remdesivir1, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These drugs, and
others that have entered clinical trials, were prioritized based on clinical observations or a contemporary
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology. In addition, numerous drug repurposing efforts have been
undertaken, screening both approved and experimental agents2-10. Yet many published reports solely focus
on active hits, and do not disclose the majority (usually >95%) of tested compounds that were inactive –
information that is critical for understanding and validating disease and drug mechanism-of-action, and
for nominating repurposed and novel clinical lead candidates. Rapid and open sharing of complete
screening datasets, including negative results, will greatly accelerate the research and discovery process
essential to the COVID-19 pandemic response.
To address this, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has developed an
online open science data portal for its COVID-19 drug repurposing campaign – named OpenData – with
the goal of making data across a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays available in real-time (Figure 1).
This approach allows researchers rapid access to drug repurposing datasets that can support subsequent
mechanistic study of compounds that perturb viral infectivity11. In this manner, open data sharing can
facilitate important insight and associated publications towards the development of interventions against
COVID-19. The OpenData dashboard, first shared publicly on May 25, 2020, makes quantitative highthroughput screening (HTS) data and detailed protocol information available for every assay screened.
The goal is to provide clinicians and researchers with a user-friendly tool that allows direct comparison of
compounds across multiple assays, with all primary concentration-response data made freely available,
through direct download. https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/

Figure 1. OpenData portal objective. The goal of the OpenData portal is to provide actionable data and
validated methodologies to the global research community to support rapid development of therapeutics
against SARS-CoV-2.
The assays that have been developed to date cover a wide spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle
(Figure 2), including both viral and human (host) targets, grouped into the following five categories
based on different mechanisms of experimental design: viral entry, viral replication, in vitro infectivity,
live virus infectivity, and counter-screens, which could flag false positives due to assay interference
artifacts or cytotoxic effects. These assays encompass protein-based assays such as the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein-ACE2 interaction and viral enzyme activity assays, in addition to cell-based pseudotyped
particle entry and live virus cytopathic effect assays. As additional assays are validated and screened, this
list will be expanded and updated. Importantly, all assay documentation including assay overview,
methodology and detailed assay protocols are available, and readily retrievable, on the OpenData site to
facilitate adoption and ensure that other laboratories can replicate these assays (Table 1).

Figure 2. NCATS SARS-CoV-2 assays currently employed to address a range of both viral and host
targets. Overview of established assays and those in development. These include assays for specific viral
targets, viral-host interaction assays, viral detection assays and viral cytopathic effect and replication
assays, among others.
In total, over 10,000 compounds are being tested in full concentration-response ranges from across
multiple annotated small molecule libraries including: (1) The NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC),
a library of 2,678 compounds approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration and related agencies
in other countries12,13; (2) a collection of 739 anti-infective compounds with potential anti-coronavirus
activity that have been reported in the literature as repurposing candidates; and (3) an annotated/bioactive
collection of diverse small molecules with known mechanisms of action, including as small molecule
probes and experimental therapeutics designed to modulate a wide range of targets, such as natural
products, epigenetic-associated compounds or compounds developed for oncology indications14,15.
Together, these libraries yield 9,958 compound responses, 8,624 of which represent structurally unique
compounds, of which 1,820 (21%) are approved for use in humans with an additional 989 (11%) having
entered human clinical evaluation (Phase 1-3 trials). Importantly, of these unique compounds, 5,224

(60%) have at least one annotated target, providing insight into potential mechanism-of-action underlying
active compounds that perturb the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in some manner.
A key goal of the OpenData portal is to allow users to view and inspect the concentration-response data
for all compounds screened, not limited to only active compounds. These complete datasets, including
full concentration-response information and compound annotations, can be directly downloaded,
providing extensive information for further analysis and data mining. In addition, a user-friendly heatmap
visualization has been implemented to allow direct and convenient comparison of compound activity
across the panel of all assays tested including orthogonal and counter assays (Figure 3).

development, including methodology, detection strategy and status. D) Detailed assay protocols are
provided to allow independent evaluation and confirmation of method and compound activities.
Currently, the OpenData portal can be queried by a search term (e.g., drug name, primary mechanism-ofaction, gene symbol) and ordered by any assay data field for increased interpretability. A high-level
overview of compound activity across multiple different assays is displayed by heatmap, with sort
functions based on curve class, efficacy, and potency. In the heatmap, darker colors indicate compounds
that are more potent and efficacious (i.e., high-quality actives), lighter colors indicate less potent and
efficacious compounds (low-quality actives), beige represents inactive compounds, and slashed boxes
denote compounds/assays not yet tested.
In addition to the NCATS COVID-19 drug repurposing screening data described above, two regularly
updated external resource sections have also been incorporated into the OpenData portal: a collection of
publications focusing on small molecule drug repurposing screens, and a list of publicly available multiomics datasets generated to evaluate aberrant biochemical pathways or identify putative biomarkers for
COVID-19.
In summary, the OpenData portal described herein has been designed to share NCATS SARS-CoV-2
complete datasets openly and without restriction, and, importantly, in real-time given the time urgency of
COVID-19 pandemic response. In addition, we have constructed the portal such that HTS datasets from
studies published by other investigators can be integrated into the portal to allow a global view of
COVID-19 drug repurposing efforts, and enable comparison of screening hits across multiple centers. We
envisage this site could act as a central portal and a unique resource to compare complete repurposing
data generated in both the public and private sectors—the authors welcome contributions of external HTS
data. We hope that this platform will help research scientists, clinical investigators and public health
officials to facilitate open data sharing and analysis to expedite the development of SARS-CoV-2
interventions, and to prioritize promising compounds and repurposed drugs for further development in
treating COVID-19.
