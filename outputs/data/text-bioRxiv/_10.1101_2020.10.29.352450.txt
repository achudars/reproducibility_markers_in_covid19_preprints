Abstract
Summary
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the newly emergent causative
agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has resulted in more than one million deaths
worldwide since it was first detected in 2019. There is a critical global need for therapeutic
intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce
associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can
inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as
therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by
brilacidin—a de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of
HDPs—on SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These
data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is primarily a result of the
impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin has demonstrated
synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate
that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising
COVID-19 drug candidate.
Highlights
•

Brilacidin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in an ACE2 positive human lung cell line.

•

Brilacidin achieved a high Selectivity Index of 426 (CC50=241μM/IC50=0.565μM).

•

Brilacidin’s main mechanism appears to disrupt viral integrity and impact viral entry.

•

Brilacidin and remdesivir exhibit excellent synergistic activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Significance Statement
SARS-CoV-2, the emergent novel coronavirus, has led to the current global COVID-19 pandemic,
characterized by extreme contagiousness and high mortality rates. There is an urgent need for
effective therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
demonstrate that brilacidin, a synthetic small molecule with peptide-like properties, is capable of
exerting potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, both as a standalone treatment and
in combination with remdesivir, which is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment
of COVID-19.

Introduction
The global COVID-19 pandemic resulting from infection by SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus,
has resulted in more than 1.16 million deaths worldwide, including 8.7 million cases and over
226,000 fatalities in the United States. 1 Additional data indicate there is a significant
underreporting of deaths. 2 Moreover, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates the
pandemic will cost the U.S. economy nearly $8 trillion through 2030, 3 with recent analysis
estimating aggregate economic losses due to COVID-19 may be as high as $16 trillion. 4
Approximately 15 percent of COVID-19 patients will develop lung injury, including severe
respiratory distress that can progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), often
requiring prolonged ventilator support and leading to death. 5 Intensive care units, hospitals and
health care systems risk becoming overwhelmed by critically ill COVID-19 patients. COVID-19
itself is characterized by a heightened inflammatory component, with several pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, strongly upregulated in infected individuals. 6, 7, 8 The
prevalence of secondary bacterial infections, 9, 10, 11, 12 which can occur in up to 20 percent of cases
among hospitalized patients, reinforces the need for a multi-pronged treatment approach that can
address the complexities of COVID-19.
To date, no vaccines have been approved to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, alongside few
modestly effective therapies to treat COVID-19, with remdesivir the only FDA-approved
treatment. 13 Therapies are predominately being developed to treat acute viral infections in hospital
settings versus being evaluated for their prophylactic potential. 14 , 15 , 16 It is likely multiple
interventional strategies will be required to prevent and treat COVID-19, 17, 18 with SARS-CoV-2
possibly becoming an endemic viral infection. 19 Drugs shown to exhibit broad spectrum antiviral
activity might help address COVID-19 and potential future viral pandemics. 20
Natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also called Host Defense Proteins/Peptides
(HDPs), comprise potentially effective countermeasures against COVID-19, having shown
inhibitory activity against multiple viruses. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 Integral components of the
innate immune response, HDPs are typically small (12-80 amino acids) proteins and peptides
expressed widely in the animal kingdom that serve as the “first line of defense” against foreign
pathogens and potential subsequent infection and related inflammation. HDPs have been
recognized as potential sources for promising therapeutics. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 In mammals,
HDPs are found within granules of neutrophils and in secretions from epithelial cells covering skin
and mucosal surfaces. Their discovery can be traced to 1939, with the extraction of gramcidin from
Bacillus brevis, followed, in the 1980s, by the isolation of cecropins in silk moths (Hyalophora)
by Hans Boman 40 and magainins in frogs (Xenopus laevis) by Michael Zasloff. 41
Despite a variety of chemical sequences, as well as secondary and tertiary structures, most HDPs
share an amphiphilic topology—with a positively-charged face on one side and a hydrophobic face
on the other side. 42 In contrast, most bacteria (and some viruses) express a negative charge on their
outer membranes, 43 as well as lack cholesterol, an essential component of mammalian
membranes. 44 , 45 Due to these differences, HDPs can selectively and variously interact with
pathogens, increasing their susceptibility to proteolysis and degradation. 46 The
immunomodulatory activity of HDPs is believed to be underestimated since most HDP research
has been conducted in cell cultures and not observed directly in humans. 47, 48 It has been suggested
that clinical development efforts against COVID-19 should be focused on advancing and

evaluating drugs with immunomodulating properties to trigger the adaptive immune response and
control inflammation. 49 The U.S. National Institutes of Health has announced a large Phase 3
clinical trial to test immune modulators against COVID-19. 50 Other modes of action for HDPs,
including an ability to affect multiple targets at once, continue to be explored, as this attribute may
be integral to contributing to overall HDP efficacy. 51
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to suppress defensins, a type of HDP, suggesting that the
innate immunity provided by defensins may be compromised. 52 Suppression of LL37, a human
cathelicidin (another type of HDP) shown to possess immunomodulatory and antiviral properties, 53
has also been observed in COVID-19 patients. 54 Increased expression of defensins and
cathelicidins, e.g., LL37, can decrease both the viral and inflammatory load in the context of
several respiratory viral infections, 55 further supporting the protective role of HDPs. LL-37 has
even been studied in an exploratory clinical trial in which encouraging early results were
reported. 56 HDPs, in particular human defensins, have been proposed as adjuvants for vaccine
development. 57, 58, 59 Due to their unique physico-chemical properties (hydrophobicity, cationic
charge) enabling impact to viruses prior to infection, HDPs are well-suited for prophylactic
development, as some HDPs appear to behave in a manner similar to the neutralization of virus
observed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 Numerous recently published
reports 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 support the antiviral activity of HDPs in the context of
coronaviruses, 73 including SARS-CoV-2.
Brilacidin (PMX-30063) is a synthetic, non-peptidic, small molecule mimetic of HDPs. 74, 75, 76, 77,
78
Building on “first principles” in medicinal chemistry, rational design tools—leveraging
sophisticated informatics to fine-tune physico-chemical properties and structure-activity
relationships 79 , 80 , 81 —enabled brilacidin (an arylamide foldamer 82 , 83 ) to overcome the
shortcomings and challenges that have complicated the clinical development of natural HDPs. 84
These include: proteolytic degradation, toxicity, lack of efficacy, malabsorption, and high cost to
produce. In contrast to natural HDPs, as well as other HDP analogs, brilacidin was designed de
novo 85, 86, 87 to be much smaller, more stable, more potent, more selective, and more economical
to manufacture.

Within this broader context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the potential therapeutic role
for HDPs, brilacidin was evaluated in laboratory testing to determine if the drug might exhibit
antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Brilacidin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication (Vero Cells)
As a first step, the potential of brilacidin to exert an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was
assessed using Vero cells as an infection model. Toxicity assessment of brilacidin in Vero cells
was initially performed by incubating the cells with increasing concentrations of the compound
for 24 hours after which cell viability was assessed by Cell Titer Glo assay. Brilacidin at up to
40µM concentration did not affect cell viability when compared to the DMSO vehicle control; a
dose-dependent, statistically significant decrease in cell viability was detected at higher
concentrations. The effect of brilacidin treatment on SARS-CoV-2 viral replication was then
evaluated in Vero cells by plaque assay. Vero cells were pre-treated with brilacidin for 2 hours
after which media containing the drug was removed and replaced with virus inoculum
(Washington strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020). Infection was allowed to progress for one hour
after which the inoculum was removed and replaced with brilacidin containing media. Cell culture
supernatants from vehicle-treated and brilacidin-treated cells were collected at 16 hours post
infection, and the SARS-CoV-2 infectious titer in the supernatants quantitated by plaque assay and
compared to the DMSO-treated control. The data demonstrate that brilacidin treatment resulted in
a dose-dependent decrease in infectious viral titer with a maximum of 53% inhibition of virus
observed in the presence of the higher concentration of compound (10µM) that was tested (Figure
2A).
Brilacidin appears to impact entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Vero cells)
The potential for brilacidin to interfere with viral entry was assessed in the Vero cell line by
looking at the ACE2:Spike protein interaction, using a rVSV pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2
expressing a luciferase reporter gene. The pseudovirus retains the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on
its surface and is capable of ACE2 based viral entry, which can be quantitated by measuring
intracellular luciferase expression; the pseudovirus is not capable of viral RNA synthesis once
inside the cell, hence any inhibitory effect is regarded as most likely limited to the early entry and
post-entry steps. The inhibition of pseudovirus (rVSV) attachment and entry into cells was
quantified in the context of brilacidin treatment (10µM and 20µM), and hydroxychloroquine was
utilized as a control. The data demonstrate that brilacidin treatment inhibited the pseudovirus at
both concentrations tested in a comparable manner (Figure 2B). The inhibition observed in the
context of the replication-incompetent pseudovirus was supportive of the suggested role of
brilacidin as an inhibitor of viral entry and potential early post-entry steps. To further support this
observation, confocal microscopy was performed using an antibody directed against the viral spike
protein in the presence and absence of brilacidin using the pseudovirus (Figure 2C).
Quantification of the confocal images revealed that incubation of SARS-CoV-2 with brilacidin
resulted in a decreased intracellular spike protein signal at 1 and 4 hours post infection.

Brilacidin appears to disrupt the integrity of the SARS-CoV-2 virion
The potential for brilacidin to interfere directly with the intact virus prior to cell attachment was
assessed. If brilacidin is able to impact viral integrity, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (Washington
strain) should increase above that observed in the assay (as in Figure 2A) when modified to include
a brilacidin-treated inoculum. To evaluate this, the inoculum was independently incubated with
10µM brilacidin for 1 hour after which the treated inoculum (virus-brilacidin mix) was used to
infect Vero cells. The infection was, thus, also carried out in the presence of brilacidin for one
hour, after which the inoculum was removed and replaced with media containing the drug. The
culture supernatants were assessed for viral load by plaque assay at 24 hours post infection. The

outcomes of this experiment revealed a higher inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (72% inhibition),
alluding to an inhibitory activity exerted upon the virus directly (Figure 2D). Using the same assay
(for 10µM brilacidin), the intracellular viral genomic copy numbers were assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR at 24 hours post infection, which demonstrated a 29% decrease in the viral
genomic copies with brilacidin treatment; this extent of inhibition of intracellular RNA copies
assessed at later timepoints in infection is not unexpected for an inhibitor with likely activity
exerted during the early entry and post-entry steps.
To independently assess the impact of brilacidin on the virion and thus add support to the role
of brilacidin as an inhibitor of viral entry, a direct virus inhibition assay was conducted akin to
virus neutralization observed in the presence of antibodies. To that end, SARS-CoV-2 inoculum
was incubated with brilacidin at 10µM concentration for 1 hour after which the treated inoculum
was used to infect Vero cells. In this experiment, the cells were not pre-treated with the inhibitor
(brilacidin) prior to the infection. After 1 hour of infection, the inoculum was removed and
replaced with fresh media without any inhibitor and the cells were maintained in inhibitor-free
media for 24 hours. The infectious virus titer in the supernatant was quantified by plaque assay,
which revealed a dramatic 90% reduction of virus titer (Figure 2E, indicated as [entry]). This
inhibition was approximately 25% higher than that observed when the cells were pre- and posttreated with brilacidin concomitantly (Figure 2E) supporting the concept that brilacidin has a
direct inhibitory effect on the virus in a manner similar to the neutralization of antibodies,
potentially by disrupting viral integrity and thus impairing the virion’s ability to complete the
viral entry process.

Brilacidin exhibits potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in a human cell line (Calu-3 cells)
To ascertain that brilacidin can elicit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in an ACE2 positive human lung
cell, experiments were conducted in the Calu-3 infection model. The toxicity of brilacidin in this
cell line was initially assessed at 10µM and 20µM concentrations by incubating the cells with the
compound for 24 hours. The assay revealed that these concentrations of brilacidin were nontoxic
to Calu-3 cells. The inhibitory effect of brilacidin in the Calu-3 cell line was first confirmed by
pre-treatment (for 2 hours) and post-infection treatment (for 24 hours) of cells with brilacidin,
which demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease of viral load, with the higher concentration of
brilacidin providing 61% inhibition of infectious viral titer (Figure 3A). However, when the
experiment was modified to include a brilacidin-treated inoculum – with direct pre-incubation of
the virus with brilacidin for 1 hour prior to infection, and with infection carried out in the presence
of the compound – the extent of inhibition dramatically increased, resulting in 95% and 97%
reduction of infectious viral titer at the 10µM and 20µM concentration of the compound
respectively (Figure 3B). Quantification of intracellular viral RNA by semi-quantitative RT-PCR
at 24 hours post infection (for 10µM brilacidin) demonstrated a 33% decrease in the viral genomic
copies upon brilacidin treatment.
The inhibition of infectious virus titer as a variable of viral load was assessed by quantifying
inhibition at lower multiplicities of infection (MOI) with brilacidin at a fixed concentration of
10µM. Interestingly, the inhibitory potential of brilacidin was best observed at the highest MOIs
tested, with inhibition of virus at the lower MOIs (0.01 and 0.001) not showing statistical
significance (Figure 3C). The inhibition exerted at the MOIs of 0.1 and 0.05 were extremely
comparable to each other.

Selectivitiy Index determination for brilacidin against SARS-CoV-2 in a human cell line
(Calu-3 cells)
The Selectivity Index, a ratio that compares a drug’s cytotoxicity and antiviral activity, is a
measure of how likely a drug is to be safe and effective when translated to human testing in the
clinic. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50), i.e., the concentration that results in the
reduction of cell viability by 50%, is compared to the concentration thar results in 50% of the
maximal inhibitory response (IC50). The values for 90% cell viability (CC10) and the 90%
inhibitory concentration (IC90) were also derived. The CC50 values for brilacidin in the context of
Calu-3 cells were assessed by measuring cell survival over a concentration range between 0.1 –
200µM, which revealed that the 50% reduction in cell viability was observed at a concentration of
241μM, with 90% viability (CC10) observed at 26.8μM, thus suggesting brilacidin was extremely
well tolerated (Figure 4A). Quantification of the inhibitory response – when the virus was directly
pre-incubated with brilacidin prior to infection; cells were treated prior to infection; brilacidin was
present during infection; and infected cells were maintained in the presence of brilacidin postinfection (assay as in Figure 3B) – demonstrated brilacidin achieved 90% inhibition at a
concentration of 2.63μM and 50% inhibition at 0.565μM, yielding a Selectivity Index of 426
(CC50=241μM/IC50=0.565μM). (Figure 4B)

Brilacidin in combination with other antiviral treatments; synergistic activity against
SARS-CoV-2 in combination with remdesivir (Calu-3 cells)
As brilacidin appears to act primarily by disrupting viral integrity and blocking viral entry,
combining the drug with antiviral treatments that have a different mechanism of action may result
in synergistic inhibition when administered in combination. The potential for brilacidin to exert a
synergistic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 when combined with current frontline COVID-19 antiviral
treatments, namely, remdesivir and favipiravir, was assessed. Potential toxicity of combinations
of remdesivir or favipiravir with brilacidin were initially assessed in the Calu-3 cell line at 24 hours
post treatment. No apparent toxicity could be detected up to 10µM concentration of each of the
drugs in the combination regimen. To evaluate the efficacy of combining remdesivir or favipiravir
with brilacidin, the cells were pre-treated with brilacidin for 2 hours. The virus inoculum was also
independently pre-incubated with brilacidin for 1 hour, and then the treated inoculum was overlaid
on cells and the infection allowed to proceed for 1 hour in the presence of brilacidin. Post-infection,
the inoculum was removed and media containing both brilacidin and remdesivir or favipiravir or
each drug alone for efficacy comparison, was added to the infected cells. Supernatants were
obtained at 24 hours post infection and infectious titer quantified by plaque assay. The data
revealed that brilacidin and favipiravir independently exerted up to 90% and 80% inhibition
respectively and the extent of inhibition did not increase over that exerted by brilacidin alone when
the two drugs were used in combination (Figure 5A). In contrast, combination of brilacidin with
remdesivir at 10µM and 2.5µM concentrations, respectively, reduced the viral infectious titer by
>99%, thus providing a highly effective inhibition profile (Figure 5B) and achieving greater
inhibition than with either compound alone. This synergistic inhibition continued to remain higher
than 99% when the concentrations of both compounds were equal (2.5µM each) (Figure 5C).

Discussion
The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic powerfully reinforces the need for therapeutic strategies
that can safely and effectively address virus- and host-based events elicited during SARS-CoV-2
infection.
In multiple studies, we have attempted to evaluate the capability of brilacidin to decrease viral load
in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our experiments in the Vero cell line model

demonstrate brilacidin decreases viral load in a robust manner when the virus is pre-incubated with
brilacidin (Figure 2D), suggesting brilacidin impacts the virus directly. This observation was
supported by the inhibition seen in the context of a replication incompetent pseudovirus (Figure
2B, Figure 2C), further indicating brilacidin’s inhibition during early stages of viral infection. As
the pseudovirus expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface, the data may also support
brilacidin’s ability to interfere with the interaction between the viral spike protein and the cellular
ACE2 receptor. Brilacidin’s ability to decrease viral load in an ACE2 positive cell line is
demonstrated in Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5, in which Calu-3 cells were used. Additional
testing conducted in Caco-2 cells and primary lung fibroblasts obtained from human donors also
supported brilacidin’s inhibitory properties in ACE2 positive cell lines (data not shown).
All experiments conducted in Vero and Calu-3 cell line models were supportive of an early
inhibition exerted by brilacidin on SARS-CoV-2, indicating the drug’s impact on viral integrity.
The idea that brilacidin directly interferes with the integrity of the virion, and hence restricts the
virion’s ability to interact with the ACE2 receptor to facilitate the entry process, is further
supported by the observation that when drug treatment was limited to the virus alone (Figure 2E),
with no treatment of host cells, a robust decrease of viral load was still observed. This mechanism
of inhibition may be akin to that achieved by neutralizing antibodies that may interact with specific
exposed epitopes on the surface of virions. It remains to be determined if the impact of brilacidin
on viral membranes is driven by specific viral membrane compositions. Additional studies are
planned.
Potent membrane destabilization by brilacidin has been reported in the context of bacteria.
Mechanistic-based membrane depolarization studies comparing brilacidin to the lipopeptidic
antibiotic daptomycin and the AMP LL16 against Staphylococcus aureus showed that brilacidin
caused an upregulation of the VraSR and WalKR regulons and affected cytoplasmic proteases and
chaperones. 88 These findings indicate brilacidin causes significant cell wall stress and additional
internal stress due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Additional mechanistic studies of
brilacidin analogs against Escherichia coli, in comparison to the antibiotic polymyxin B, further
support this class of compounds ability to destabilize bacterial membranes. 89
While brilacidin’s mechanism of action appears primarily to be extracellular, it may also impact
intracellular viral replication and is planned to be researched further. Supportive of this, an in silico
quantum mechanical molecular screening study of 11,522 compounds identified brilacidin as a
potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 based on the potential of its physico-chemical properties to
interfere with the intracellular replication of SARS-CoV-2’s main protease (Mpro). 90
The high CC50 (a measure of cytotoxicity) and low IC50 (a measure of potency) values observed
for brilacidin in Calu-3 cells—yielding a Selectivity Index (SI) for brilacidin of 426
(CC50=241μM/IC50=0.565μM)—strongly support brilacidin’s treatment potential to achieve
positive antiviral outcomes in humans. A vast majority of other drugs being evaluated as potential
COVID-19 treatments, including repurposed drugs, have SIs that are much lower than that
achieved by brilacidin, 91 with most drugs failing to show anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in the <1μM
range. 92 Of note, the IC50 (0.565μM) and IC90 (2.63μM) values for brilacidin observed in the Calu3 cell line are well below clinically-achievable concentrations based on pharmacokinetics observed
in a Phase 2b clinical trial of brilacidin for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure
Infections (ABSSSI): median Cmax in plasma was 7.67μM brilacidin (free-base) from a single IV
dose of 0.6 mg/kg.

A desirable outcome for any potential COVID-19 therapeutic will be its ability to synergize with
existing COVID-19 treatments, particularly if the mechanisms of action of the synergistic
treatments can impact more than one step of the viral lifecycle. Such combinations are more likely
to elicit an additive response, while also reducing the likelihood of viral resistance developing.
Along these lines, we conducted experiments to evaluate the potential of brilacidin to work in
conjunction with remdesivir and favipiravir (Figure 5), two frontline COVID-19 treatments,
which proved supportive of synergistic inhibition between brilacidin and remdesivir. Remdesivir
and favipiravir are inhibitors that impact the viral RNA synthesis step of the infectious process.
These drugs may help decrease progeny viral genomes in infected cells, but they will not be
conducive to inhibiting progressive infection of naïve cells once the progeny virions have been
released from infected cells.
By combining remdesivir or favipiravir with brilacidin, a two-pronged strategy of inhibiting viral
entry and viral RNA synthesis might be successfully leveraged to most effectively control
progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, remdesivir and favipiravir do not possess
intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity, unlike brilacidin. Any reduction in inflammatory mediators,
including IL-6 and IL-1β in the context of remdesivir and favipiravir treatment, are likely to be a
direct consequence of decrease in replicating virus. Moreover, ARDS and associated organ failure
observed in the context of COVID-19 are typically later-stage manifestations of disease that are
not directly related to, or dependent on, a mounting viral load. Consequently, use of a drug strategy
that exhibits intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity will add value to controlling later onset
inflammatory damage in COVID-19 patients, potentially occurring beyond the time of active viral
multiplication. Along similar lines, it remains to be determined if the combination of convalescent
serum—a current COVID-19 treatment that has received FDA Emergency Use Authorization—
with brilacidin may confer a protective advantage to patients. It is less likely that a synergistic
effect may be observed by combining neutralizing antibodies with brilacidin as it appears the
dominant mechanism of action in both cases is disruption of viral entry into cells.
Clearly, an effective COVID-19 therapeutic (or therapeutics in combination) ideally would control
both viral load and the corresponding inflammatory damage due to SARS-CoV-2, 93 and mitigate
bacterial co-infections. Exhibiting three-in-one properties—antiviral, immuno/anti-inflammatory,
and antibacterial—brilacidin is being developed for the intravenous treatment of COVID-19 in
hospitalized patients and may be able to address different disease parameters within the one
therapeutic treatment.
Brilacidin has been successfully tested in 8 clinical trials across multiple indications providing
established safety and efficacy data on over 460 subjects. The drug has exhibited potent
antibacterial activity in a Phase 2b trial in Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections
(ABSSSI) and anti-inflammatory activity, as supported in Phase 2 clinical trials in Ulcerative
Proctitis/Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis and Oral Mucositis (see Supplemental Information).
Brilacidin, through modulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, is postulated to regulate the immune response based largely on
its observed inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE4 and PDE3). Interestingly, numerous PDE
inhibitors have been proposed as potentially promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments by
suppressing the heightened inflammatory response. 94
Additional formulation work is planned for the inhaled delivery of brilacidin for prophylactic use,
toward controlling infection in the nasal passage and lungs by leveraging brilacidin’s ability to

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by disrupting viral integrity and impacting viral entry. Such development
efforts, if successful, may enable brilacidin to emerge as a particularly effective and differentiated
antiviral by preventing and/or decreasing early infectivity due to SARS-CoV-2.
In this manuscript, we demonstrate brilacidin exhibits robust inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero
cells and Calu-3 cells, supporting brilacidin as a promising novel drug candidate for the treatment
of COVID-19. Functioning as a viral entry inhibitor, 95, 96, 97 proposed mechanisms of action for
brilacidin include affecting the integrity of the viral membrane and preventing viral binding to
cells. More detailed mechanistic studies are planned. Destabilizing viral integrity is a desirable
antiviral property, especially in relation to pan-coronavirus agents, as the viral membrane is highly
conserved and similar in construct across different coronavirus strains. 98, 99 Moreover, drugs that
can directly disrupt viral integrity would be less prone to resistance due to mutation, unlike many
antivirals, antibody-based treatments and vaccines that are currently in use and in development.
Brilacidin exhibits an excellent synergistic inhibitory profile against SARS-CoV-2 in combination
with remdesivir. Experiments conducted in endemic human coronaviruses are ongoing, with
additional testing planned in other lethal coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV), toward
assessing the potential of brilacidin as a broad spectrum inhibitor of coronaviruses.

inactivated fetal bovine essence (FBE) (VWR, 10805-184) for Vero cells, 10ug/mL streptomycin
and 10U/mL penicillin (VWR, 45000-652). Calu-3 cells were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Medium (EMEM, VWR, 670086) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(ThermoFisher, 10437028). All cell lines were cultivated at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Inhibitors
Brilacidin (as brilacidin tetrahydrochloride) was provided by Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc., and
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fisher Scientific, BP231). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate
(SelleckChem, S4430), remdesivir (MedChemExpress, HY-104077), and favipiravir
(FisherScientific, NC1312443) were obtained and dissolved in DMSO.
Toxicity Screens
Cells were seeded in 96-well white plates 24h prior as follows: Vero and Caco-2 cells at 5x104
cells per well, Calu-3 cells at 1.3x105 cells per well. Inhibitors were diluted to the desired
micromolar concentration (μM) in the appropriate culture media. Diluted compounds were added
to the cells and plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. At 24 hours post-treatment (hpt), culture
media was removed from the cells and cell viability was measured using a CellTiter-Glo®
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay per manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, G7572).
Luminescence was measured using a Beckman Coulter DTX 880 multimode plate reader.
SARS-CoV-2 Infections
SARS-CoV-2 (Washington strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from BEI
Resources (NR-52281) and was used for all infections, unless otherwise specified. For all
infections, cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24h prior as follows: Vero cells at 5x104 cells per
well, Calu-3 cells at 1.3x105 cells per well. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in
culture media to the indicated concentrations such that the final concentration of DMSO in the
treatment was ≤0.1%. Mock infected cells were included as untreated and uninfected controls
during all infections. Cells were pretreated with media containing drug or 0.1% DMSO vehicle
control for 2h prior to infection. For non-direct viral infections, virus was diluted in culture media
to the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) and this inoculum overlaid on cells for 1h. For
direct viral infections, virus was diluted to the indicated MOI in culture media containing 0.1%
DMSO or the inhibitor at the indicated concentration, and this virus:inhibitor solution, i.e., treated
inoculum, incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1h. After this incubation, the treated inoculum was
overlaid on cells for 1h. Conditioned media containing inhibitor or standard media was added to
cells after removal of virus. For synergy experiments, fresh media containing inhibitor(s) was
added to cells after removal of virus. Plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for the indicated
duration. At the indicated hour time point post-infection (hpi), viral supernatants were collected
and stored at -80°C or used immediately for assays.
Plaque Assay
Vero cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 2x105 per well and incubated for 24h.
Infection supernatants were serially diluted to 10-4 in culture media and overlaid on cells for 1h.
Cells were covered with Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (without phenol red, supplemented
with 5% FBE, non-essential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate (VWR, 45000-710), 2mM Lglutamine, 20U/mL penicillin, and 20μg/mL streptomycin) with 0.6% agarose (ThermoFisher,
16500100). At 48hpi, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde (FisherSci, F79P-4) for 1h. Medium

C581-25) and 20% ethanol solution (FisherSci, BP2818-4). Plaque assay datasets are represented
as both plaque forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL) and as percentage of virus titer versus the
DMSO control.
Pseudovirus Spike Neutralization Assay
Vero cells were seeded in a black 96-well plate at 5x104 cells per well and incubated for 24h.
Inhibitors were diluted in serum-free culture media at 2X of the indicated concentration and mixed
with an equal volume of a luciferase-expressing pseudotyped virus (rVSV) containing the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, diluted 1:5 in serum-free culture media (kindly contributed by IBT
Bioservices) and incubated for 1h at room temperature. Media was removed from Vero cells and
the rVSV:inhibitor solution was added to the cells and incubated for 1h at 37°C and 5% CO2. After
1h, equal volume of complete media was added to the cells and incubated for 24h at 37°C and 5%
CO2. Media was removed and Vero cells were lysed with 1X Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega,
E1941) for 30min while shaking. Equal volume of Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega, E4550)
was added to the cells and luciferase signal was measured using an integration time of 1s on a
Beckman Coulter DTX 880 multimode plate reader. Neutralization was determined relative to the
rVSV-only condition and mock-treated controls established limits of detection for relative light
units.
Confocal Micrcoscopy of Spike Neutralization Assay
Glass chamber slides (Ibidi, 80827) were treated with fibronectin from bovine plasma (SigmaAldrich, F1141) and allowed to dry, followed by washing with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
(VWR, L0119). Vero cells were seeded in the fibronectin coated chamber slides at 5x104 cells per
well 24h prior to assay. Cells were treated with rVSV:inhibitor solution in the same manner as
previously described for the neutralization assay. At 1hpi and 4hpi, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS (Alfa Aesar, J61899) for at least 10min followed by three washes
with 1X PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100) in 1X
PBS for 15min at room temperature, followed by three washes with 1X PBS. Wells were blocked
with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fisher Scientific, BP1600) in 1X PBS while rocking
overnight at 4°C. Cells were stained with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Antibody (ProSci, 3525) diluted to
1μg/mL in 0.1% BSA in 1X PBS and incubated at room temperature for 2h followed by three 5min
washes with 1X PBS. Alexa Fluor™ 488 fluorescent dye-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen,
A21206) was diluted 1:1000 in 0.1% BSA in 1X PBS and incubated on the chamber wells for
45min at room temperature protected from light, followed by three 5min washes with 1X PBS
with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P9416). Mounting medium (Ibidi, 50001) with NucBlu™
DNA nuclear counterstain (Invitrogen, R37605) was added to all chamber wells and slides were
protected from light prior to imaging. Mock-infected wells and primary antibody treatment only,
or secondary antibody treatment only were included as assay and imaging controls, respectively.
Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 Fluorescent Microscope equipped with NIS
Elements Software at 60X oil immersion objective. DAPI and FITC filters were utilized to
qualitatively view fluorescence and quantitatively measure fluorescent counts of FITC using
surface intensity plots. Neutralization was determined relative to the rVSV-only condition and
mock-treated controls established background fluorescence.

RNA extraction and RT-PCR
At the indicated time points post-infection, cells were washed with 1X PBS and lysed with TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen). Intracellular RNA was extracted using Direct-zol Miniprep RNA kit (Zymo
Research, R2051s) per manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted viral RNA was stored at -80°C or
used immediately for analysis by RT-PCR. Primers and probes for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
specific to ORF 1ab for the envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) viral genome fragments were
obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (10006821, 10006822, 10006823). The probe was
double-quenched with ZEN/IBFQ and contained a 6-FAM fluorescent dye attachment at the 5’
end. 18S rRNA endogenous control primer/probe set was utilized for semi-quantitative RT-PCR
normalization (ThermoFisher, 4333760T). Thermal cycling conditions were adapted from Verso
1-step RT-qPCR kit (ThermoFisher, AB4101C) per the manufacturer’s instructions: 1 cycle at
50°C for 20min, 1cycle at 95°C for 15min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 15s with 52°C (CoV2 E,N) and
60°C (18S) for 1min using StepOnePlus™ Real Time PCR System. Controls with no template
RNA and samples from mock infected controls were included for all analyses and established the
limits of detection. Quantitative values were calculating using the ΔΔCt method with viral entities
normalized to 18S levels and fold-changes calculated versus mock-infected conditions. Datasets
are represented as both raw values calculated for fold-change and as a percentage versus the
DMSO condition.
