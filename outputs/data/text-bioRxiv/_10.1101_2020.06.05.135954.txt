Relevance. A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in December 2019 in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have died all around
the planet. Quickly after the pandemic onset, metagenomic studies showed the causative agent, now
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was a new human
coronavirus. It is now classified in the Betacoronavirus genus, inside the subgenus Sarbecovirus,
responsible for spillover events in 2002 and 2012 (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle
East respiratory syndrome, respectively). The zoonotic origins of these viruses (possibly bats,
camelids, pangolins and/or palm civets) have received much attention. However, other evolutionary
aspects, such as spatial variation, have received comparatively little attention. This study shows that
SARS-CoV-2 variants are heterogeneously distributed on Earth and demonstrates that the virus
phylogeny is geographically structured. The phenomenon affects the virus RNA and protein
sequences. We explain how this may be due to founder effects combined with high mutation rates.

Abstract.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent RNA virus that
spread around the planet in about 4 months. The consequences of this rapid dispersion are under
investigation. In this work, we analyzed thousands of genomes and protein sequences from Africa,
America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. We show that the virus is a complex of slightly different
variants that are unevenly distributed on Earth, and demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is
spatially structured. Remarkably, the virus phylogeographic patterns were associated with ancestral
amino acidic mutations. We hypothesize that geographic structuring is the result of founder effects
occurring as a consequence of, and local evolution occurring after, long-distance dispersal. Based
on previous studies, the possibility that this could significantly affect the virus phenotype is not
remote.

Introduction
A cluster of acute atypical pneumonia syndrome cases of unknown etiology was reported late
December 2019 in China. Rapidly, metagenomic RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
showed that the etiological agent was a new human coronavirus (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020),
now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; Gorbalenya et al.,
2020). Human coronaviruses are well known to produce mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract
illnesses. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) responsible for a
2002-2003 epidemic, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) responsible for a
2012 outbreak and the novel SARS-CoV-2, cause severe syndromes with high fatality rates (10%,
36% and 4 %, respectively) (Cui et al., 2019; WHO, 2020). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are
~79% identical at the genetic level and share important features as the same cell receptor and
immunopathogenic mechanism.

SARS-CoV-2 has dispersed to hundreds of countries, causing millions of infections. The
consequences of this rapid spread on the virus evolution are still unclear. Recent studies suggested
that SARS-CoV-2 genotypes are heterogeneously distributed (Forster et al., 2020; Rambaut et al.,
2020). However, quantitative and phenotypic assessments are still lacking. When relatedness
between spatially coexisting lineages is greater than expected, their distribution is said to be
phylogenetically structured (Webb et al., 2002). One of the consequences of structuring is spatially
close sequences being more similar to each other than expected by chance (Figure S1). The
phenomenon can be assessed by comparing measured phylogenetic distances with those expected
under no structuring, which can be accomplished by Monte Carlo simulations. Here, we describe an
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from the beginning of the pandemic to April 25, 2020.
We observed an uneven distribution of genetic and amino acidic variants, and a statistically
significant spatial phylogenetic structure. Notably, ancestral amino acidic substitutions were highly
fitted to the virus phylogeny and geographic patterns, strongly suggesting that long-distance
dispersal can facilitate the establishment of otherwise rare, and/or the emergence of new, viral
phenotypes.

Materials and Methods
Operational Taxonomic Units delimitation and Datasets. Structure analyses require to determine
the abundance patterns of a set of operational taxonomic units (Webb et al., 2002). We initially
studied a small dataset of 831 genomes. The smallness of this sample allowed us to identify
sequence variants (SV) from all the possible pair-wise Needleman-Wunsch alignments in the
dataset. By the other side, we compiled a much larger dataset (n=8,612 genomes), aiming to gather
a wider genomes sample to assess the virus spatial phylogenetic structure. The procedure used to
delimit the small dataset SVs has a time complexity of O(n2L) - O(n3L), where n and L are the
sequences’ number and length, respectively. Thus, the approach could not be used with the large

dataset, for which pair-wise distance were obtained from the sequences’ multiple alignment (details
below). The small dataset studied here consisted in all the genomes described from the beginning of
the pandemic to March 14, 2020 (Table S1). These sequences were first inspected for the presence
of ambiguous and undetermined positions by the base.freq() function from the Ape package
(Paradis and Schliep, 2018). The selected data (genomes with no non-DNA characters) were
aligned with Mafft (Katoh and Toh, 2008) (details below) and the obtained alignment was visually
inspected with Jalview (Waterhouse et al., 2009). This revealed the rare presence of sequences with
internal and terminal gaps, which were dismissed (Table S1). After removing these sequences and
unifying sequences recorded in both GenBank and GISAID’s EpiCoV™, we ended up with 353
genomes. From these, we generated 62,128 Needleman-Wunsch pairwise alignments and, for each
one, counted the number of mismatches and indels. End gaps were excluded from the counts since
these correspond to sequencing differences. Pairwise alignments and hamming distances were
obtained with the nwhamming() function of the Dada2 package (Callahan et al., 2016). Shortly, we
made an R script that takes a sequence (the query) from a dataset, aligns it against the rest of
sequences and calculates the corresponding hamming distances:
pDists <- foreach(i=1:length(rest_of_sequences),
.packages = c("ape", "dada2")) %dopar%
{
nwhamming(query_sequence, rest_of_sequences[[i]])
}

Based on the obtained distances, the script determines which sequences are identical to the query
sequence, put these together in an identity cluster, and starts a new iteration. This was repeated until
all the sequences in the dataset were processed. We ensured that the sequences representative of
each SV used in posterior analyses were the longest of each identity cluster. The large dataset
studied here consisted in all the sequences in GISAID’s EpiCoV™ Database sampled between
December 2019 and April 25, 2020 presenting less than 1 % non-DNA characters (high coverage

only option) (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017). The corresponding
sequences and metadata are described in Table S2. As a first step we filtered-out all the sequences
presenting non-DNA characters. Previous to clustering and phylogenetic analyses, we aligned the
sequences and evaluated the diversity along the obtained alignment by inspecting the entropy at
each aligned position using the HDMD package (https://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=HDMD). The alignment positions homologous to nucleotides 1-77 and
29,804-29,903 of the isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) presented too high diversities compared
to the rest of the genome (Fig. S2). Thus, these regions were masked-out in posterior analyses.
Furthermore, the sequences presenting missing data after and before positions 77 and 28,804,
respectively, and rare internal gaps were dismissed. The final, high-quality dataset had 4,333
genomes. Pairwise distances were obtained from the aligned sequences using R string comparison
tools, and processed similarly to what was done with the small dataset.
SV abundances. If the variants of a virus are randomly distributed among human populations, the
probability of detecting a given SV i, in some area Aj, P(Vi|Aj), should be the same for all j:
P(Vi|A1)=P(Vi|A2)=...=P(Vi|AN)=P(Vi), where N is the number of sampled areas. We modeled the
probability of observing a given SV, P(Vi), by its frequency in the data. Then, the expected number
of SV i sequences in region Aj can be obtained as P(i) × Mj, where Mj is the number of sequences
from Aj. Standardized deviations from expectation can be obtained by dividing the squared
deviations (Oij – Eij)2 by Eij, where Oij and Eij are the observed and expected numbers of SV i
sequences in region j, respectively. This statistic is not affected by the order of magnitude of the
data, which allows to straightforwardly compare very abundant and rare SVs, and shallowly and
much sampled regions.
Phylogenetic analysis. Sequence alignments were obtained with Mafft’s FFT-NS-2 algorithm.
Under this strategy, the program first generates a rough alignment (namely FFT-NS-1 alignment)
from a guide tree created from a distance matrix made by computing the number of hexamers

shared between all sequence pairs. Then the FFT-NS-1 alignment is used to generate a new tree,
which is used to guide a second progressive alignment. Once aligned, the small dataset presented
512 variable sites of which 109 were parsimony informative. The large dataset alignment presented
2,713 polymorphic sites of which 885 were parsimony informative. The small dataset was
phylogenetically analyzed with PhyML version 3.3 (Guindon et al., 2010) under a generalized timereversible model with a proportion of invariable sites and 4 rate categories. The nucleotide
frequencies, proportion of invariable sites and value of the gamma shape parameter were maximumlikelihood estimated. Tree searches consisted in 100 parsimony starting trees that were refined by
NNI and SPR branch swaps (option -s BEST). Branch supports were estimated with PhyML’s
bootstrap routine. The large dataset analyses were performed with IQTREE (Minh et al., 2020)
using the GTR+I+G model of nucleotide substitution (selected by the IQTREE’s BIC routine) with
base frequencies inferred from the data and the default tree search algorithm. Branch supports were
calculated by ultrafast bootstrap (Hoang et al., 2017) (n=1,000) in IQTREE. Trees were inspected
and plotted by Dendroscope (Huson and Scornavacca, 2012), Ape and ggtree (Yu, 2020). Ancestral
character states were inferred with the ace() function from Ape using the SVs’ sequences and
phylogeny.
Spatial phylogenetic structure. Structure analyses were performed by the picante package
(Kembel et al., 2010). Null distributions were inferred by shuffling SVs across tree tips 10,000
times. Using the obtained permutations and the actual data, the software calculates the following
weighted metric for each region:
SESMPD = (MPDOBS – mean(MPDH0))/sd(MPDH0),
where MPDOBS is the mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) between all sequences from the region,
mean(MPDH0) is the average of the mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) between the sequences from
the region in the randomized data and sd(MPDH0) is the corresponding standard deviation. Negative

and low SESMPD values support structured distributions. Significance levels are calculated as the
MPDOBS rank divided by the number of permutations minus one.

Results
SV analyses. Out of 62,128 pairwise comparisons performed from the small dataset, 61,759
(99.4%) revealed 1 or more mutations and 36,771 (59.1%) showed between 5 (Q1) and 11 (Q3)
changes. The analysis of the large dataset also revealed a very large diversity, as depicted in Figure
1. Out of 9,385,278 genome pairs compared, only 50,839 (0.5%) were identical and 5,056,965
(53.8%) showed between 6 (Q1) and 12 (Q2) reciprocal mutations. The number of detected SVs
relative to the total number of sequences analyzed was very similar for both datasets and methods.
For the small dataset we observed one SV every 1.55 sequences, while for the large one the ratio
was of 1.85. The small dataset presented 228 unique sequences or SVs. The most abundant SV was
represented by 30 sequences. Twenty five were represented by 2 sequences each, 9 by 3 sequences,
3 by 4, 4 by 5 and the remaining three by 7, 9 and 14 sequences. These results are summarized in
Table S3. The large dataset presented 2,336 operational taxonomic units or SVs. The most abundant
SV was represented by 224 sequences. Eleven SVs presented more than 30 sequences each, 27
presented at least 10 sequences and 365 presented between 2 and 10 sequences. These results are
detailed in Table S4.
SVs distribution. In the small dataset, the 24 most abundant SVs in Europe (n=78 genomes; SVs 2,
6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 29, 30, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45; Table S3)
were absent from other continents and SV 1 was very prevalent in Asia (22 genomes) in comparison
to North America (7 genomes). This can be easily appreciated from the deviations of the observed
SV abundances from those expected if the virus variants were randomly distributed (Table S3). SVs
2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 29, 30, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45 had a mean
deviation from expectation of 2.4 in Europe, whereas, for the same region, the rest of SVs had a

mean deviation of 0.68. Likewise, SV 1 deviations from expectation in Asia and Europe were 8.37
and 11.08, respectively, whereas in North America, Oceania and South America these were of only
2.26, 0.93 and 0.085, respectively. This reflects this SV's over-abundance in Asia and rarity in
Europe, and that its frequencies in the rest of the continents are relatively well predicted by its
global abundance. (Materials and Methods). The counts and distributions of the 2,336 SVs
identified from the large dataset are detailed in Table S4. As observed for the small dataset, these
SVs distribution was very uneven. Here we highlight the most relevant cases. Of the SVs
represented by at least 10 sequences, only SVs 17 and 37 were distributed more or less
homogeneously. The SV 1 abundance was smaller than expected in Asia, and larger than expected
in North America. The SV 2 was represented only among the North American sequences and the
SV 3 was over-abundant in Europe and scarcely represented in North America. The SVs 4, 9, 12, 23
and 29 were over-represented (SVs 4, 9 and 12) or exclusively observed (SVs 12 and 23) in Asia.
The SVs 5 and 6 were too abundant in Europe and South America and were under-represented in
Asia and North America. The SVs 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35 and 38
were over-represented or exclusively detected in Europe. The SVs 11, 13, 15, 18, 22, 27 and 36
displayed more sequences than expected by chance in North America. The number of SV 28
genomes observed among the Oceania samples was about 20 times greater than expected. Likewise,
the SVs 25 and 32 counts in South America and Africa, respectively, were approximately 22 and 21
times larger than the corresponding expected numbers.
Phylogenetic structure analyses. The small dataset phylogeny is shown in Figure 2. A heat map
describing the SVs distribution is shown alongside the phylogeny. Tree terminals are aligned with
the heatmap cells, so that the Figure depicts the tree lineages’ abundances at each continent
(heatmap columns). Clades A, B , H, I and J were distributed in Europe. Likewise, the majority of
sequences located at clades A-D, and the sequences grouped in clades F and G were common in
Europe. The exceptions were SVs 226, 46 and 112, which correspond to samples from North

America (SVs 226 and 112) or from North America and Europe (SV 46). Most sequences in the
branch containing clades M and N are from North America. Clades E and K sequences are all from
Asia. As expected from the visual inspection of the SVs phylogeny and distribution, structuring was
highly significant for North America and Europe (Table 1). The phylogeny and distributions of the
large dataset SVs are detailed in Figure S3. A thorough inspection of these results revealed six
major sections of the tree in which the sequences were clumped according to their origins, as shown
in a simplified manner in Figure 3. For practical reasons, we refer to these six tree sections as A, B,
C, D, E, and F. The North American sequences were more abundant in sections A and E while the
European ones were prevalent in sections B, C and F, and moderately represented in section A. The
Asian sequences clustered preferentially in section D, and in sections C, E and F but in proximal
positions relative to the positions occupied by the North American (region E) and European
(regions C and F) sequences. Limitation in space was significant (p < 0.01) for Asia, Europe and
North America (Table 2).
Protein level phylogeographic analysis. To asses if the phylogenetic structuring process affected
the virus proteins, we analyzed the distribution and ancestral trajectories of 11 amino acidic
polymorphisms, all of which were endorsed by at least 100 sequences (Fig. 4). The geographic
distributions of the corresponding amino acid variants were very heterogeneous. Furthermore,
ancestral amino acidic transitions were highly fitted to the virus phylogeny and occurred at branches
dividing the main tree sections described above, or separating large tree chunks inside these
sections. These results are summarized in Figures 5-8. The distributions of the 57Q/H, 85T/I and
614 D/G polymorphisms of the orf3, nsp2 and S proteins, respectively, were very contrasting
between the east and west (Fig 5). The amino acidic variants 57H, 85I, and 614G were frequent in
Europe and North America, whereas 57Q, 85T, and 514D were relatively abundant in Asia. Unlike
the majority of countries, China presented neither the 175M variant of the M protein nor amino
acids K and R at positions 203 and 204, respectively, of the N protein (Fig 6). The nsp13 protein

amino acids 504L and 541C were almost exclusively observed among the sequences from North
America and Australia (Fig. 7 a and b). The 84L/S polymorphism (orf8 protein) displayed a similar
geographic pattern. However, the 84S variant turned out to be abundant in China and South Korea
as well as in North America and Australia (Fig. 7 c). The 37 and 251 positions of the nsp6 and orf3a
proteins, respectively, experienced mutations inside the C tree section (Fig. 8). However, position
37 also experienced a change in tree section D. In agreement with this, the 215V variant was
prevalent in Europe, China and Australia, whereas 37F was also abundant in Japan and relatively
more abundant than 215V in Australia.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants. Using an exact algorithm, we identified 228 sequence variants
among 353 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled from mid-December 2019 to March 14, 2020. In a
similar way, pairwise comparisons made from a multiple alignment of 4,333 selected sequences
sampled between December 2019 and April 25 2020, revealed 2,336 genetic variants. Less than half
the here studied sequences were identical to at least one of the rest of sequences and, out of
9,385,278 genome pairs compared from the large dataset, only 50,839 showed no mutations. A raw
extrapolation of our results suggests that, only among the ~60,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
sequenced so far, there could be some 30,000 unique sequences. These data are overwhelming. We
anticipate significant methodological challenges, especially if the number of SARS-CoV-2
sequences continues to increase at present rates. As explained in the Materials and Methods, the
approach used here to analyze the small dataset is O(N2L) to O(N3L) complex. This means that,
depending on the algorithm and software used, it would be very expensive to replicate the analyses
for more than several hundred or some few thousand sequences. Likely impossible for more than
10,000 sequences (Blackshields et al., 2010). The alternative approach implemented here, that is to
base sequence comparisons on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), allows avoiding the costly

pairwise alignment step. However, the approach also faces some challenges. MSAs usually present
misaligned ends attributable to sequencing differences. This can be difficult to handle, especially
for large datasets, since there is no standardized procedure to deal with the problem. The issue
(which is not exclusive of SARS-CoV-2) is frequently addressed by trimming off the problematic
alignment regions. However, this involves visual inspection and data dismissal, which will require
automation and reproducible procedures. Standard procedures are neither available for dealing with
incomplete sequences, which are sometimes padded with Ns, and ambiguous base calls. Although in
some cases it can be handy to simply discard such sequences, some incomplete sequences may
contain useful information that is absent from other sequences.
Spatial Phylogenetic Structure. Here, we presented statistical evidence that SARS-CoV-2
phylogeny is spatially structured. From a biological point of view, this imply that the virus gene
pool varies by world region. Remarkably, the virus phylogenetic structure has a close correlate at
the protein level. All ancestral nodes inside tree section A presented the 57H and 85I amino acidic
variants (Fig. 5 a and b). This indicate that the divergence event leading to the split between tree
section A and the rest of the phylogeny was accompanied by protein mutations in the orf3a and
nsp2 proteins. The fact that the strains from tree section A were abundant in North America and
Europe (Fig. 3 a and b), strongly suggests that viral dispersal to, or from, these regions was
associated with the emergence of polymorphisms 57Q/H and 85T/I. In a similar way, the 614D/G,
504P/L, 541Y/C and 84L/S polymorphism may have resulted from the spread of the virus between
the east and west (Figs. 5 c and 7 a-c, respectively). The 175T/M, 203R/K and 204G/R transitions
occurred inside tree section B (Fig. 6), which was highly represented among the European
sequences (Fig. 3 b). This, together with the presence of 203K and 204R in Russia, suggests that
these polymorphisms may have emerged in Europe or Russia. In a similar way, the 37L/F and
251G/V polymorphisms likely emerged in association with dispersal to, or from, Europe (Fig. 8).
Our ancestral states inferences indicated that the amino acidic position 37 of the nsp6 protein

experienced several independent L/P transitions. Two such transitions occurred at the phylogeny
branches separating tree sections C and D from the rest of the virus phylogeny (Fig. 8 a). These two
tree sections were well represented in Europe and Japan, respectively, strongly suggesting that
37L/F emergence may has occurred twice as a consequence of independent dispersion events.
Biogeographic patterns have been previously observed in other coronaviruses (Chu et al., 2018)
and very different viruses as phages and retroviruses (Díaz-Muñoz et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al.,
2009). That SARS-CoV-2 has developed a biogeography despite its high propagation rate may
seem contradictory. However, spatial diversification depends not only on dispersion constraints but
also on evolutionary rates. In particular, spatially structured phylogenies can be the consequence of
speciation rates being very high relative to dispersion rates (Webb et al., 2002). As far as we know,
travels between remote places constitute the only dispersal mechanism of the virus. This implies
that founder viruses usually carry very small fractions of the total genetic variation of the source
populations. Therefore, each time the virus spreads, substantial losses of diversity can occur,
possibly combined with rare mutations settlement, due to founder effects. In addition, it stands to
reason that, after dispersal, mutations accumulate quickly as newly established populations enlarge,
due to viral polymerases high error rates (Gago et al., 2009; Moya et al., 2004). Some of these
mutations can lead to novel phenotypes, as shown in Figures 3-8. Based on these considerations, it
is reasonable to hypothesize that long-distance dispersal constitutes an opportunity for the virus to
fix otherwise rare, and/or develop new, mutations.
The 2002-2003 SARS-CoV epidemic was subdivided into three genetically different phases,
indicating that coronaviruses can mutate recurrently along relatively short periods of time (The
Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). It has been shown that slight
mutations can produce significant phenotypic effects in MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses (Chu
et al., 2018; Rasschaert et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 2007). Furthermore, recent experimental studies

Zhang et al., 2020). Here we show that at least 10 further protein polymorphisms may have
emerged along the recent SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history. This must be taken as a call for
attention. The virus evolution should continue to be monitored and relationships should be sought
between viral diversity and pathogenesis.
