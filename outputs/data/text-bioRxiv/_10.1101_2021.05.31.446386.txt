ABSTRACT

24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the

25

COVID-19 pandemic, most likely emerged from bats1. A prerequisite for this devastating

26

zoonosis was the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein to use human

27

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. Although the S protein of the

28

closest related bat virus, RaTG13, shows high similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein it

29

does not efficiently interact with the human ACE2 receptor2. Here, we show that a single

30

T403R mutation allows the RaTG13 S to utilize the human ACE2 receptor for infection

31

of human cells and intestinal organoids. Conversely, mutation of R403T in the SARS-

32

CoV-2 S significantly reduced ACE2-mediated virus infection. The S protein of SARS-

33

CoV-1 that also uses human ACE2 also contains a positive residue (K) at this position,

34

while the S proteins of CoVs utilizing other receptors vary at this location. Our results

35

indicate that the presence of a positively charged amino acid at position 403 in the S

36

protein is critical for efficient utilization of human ACE2. This finding could help to

37

predict the zoonotic potential of animal coronaviruses.

38

Since its first occurrence in Wuhan in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of

39

COVID-19, has infected about 170 million people by May 2021 and caused a global health and

40

economic crisis3. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronaviruses,

41

which are mainly found in bats3. Horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae) also harbour viruses that are

42

closely related to SARS-CoV-1 that infected about 8.000 people in 2002 and 20033,4. The bat

43

virus RaTG13 sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bat in 2013 in Yunnan has been

44

identified as the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 showing approximately 96% sequence

45

identity throughout the genome1. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from horseshoe

46

bats1,5, although it has been proposed that cross-species transmission to humans may have

47

involved pangolins as secondary intermediate host6,7.

48

The Spike (S) proteins of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 utilize the human

49

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human target cells8–11. The ability

50

to use a human receptor for efficient infection is a key prerequisite for successful zoonotic

51

transmission. Although the RaTG13 S protein is highly similar to the SARS-CoV-2 S it does

52

not interact efficiently with the human ACE2 receptor2, suggesting that this bat virus would

53

most likely not be able to directly infect humans. It has been reported that specific alterations

54

in the receptor-binding domain (RBD)12, as well as a four-amino-acid insertion (PRRA)

55

introducing a furin-cleavage site,8,13 play a key role in efficient ACE2 utilization and

56

consequently the high infectiousness and efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, it

57

remains poorly understood which specific features allow the S proteins of bat CoVs to use

58

human ACE2 as entry cofactor and thus to successfully cross the species barrier to humans.

59

Computational analyses suggested that R403 is involved in intramolecular interactions

60

stabilizing the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer interface2 and contributes significantly to the strength of

61

SARS-CoV-2 RBD interaction with the human ACE2 receptor14. We found that R403 is highly

62

conserved in SARS-CoV-2 S proteins: only 233 of 1.7 million sequence records contain a

63

conservative change of R403K and just 18 another residue or deletion. Notably, the presence

64

of a positively charged residue at position 403 distinguishes the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1

65

(K403) and SARS-CoV-2 (R403) from the bat CoV RaTG13 S protein (T403) (Fig. 1a).

66

Molecular modelling of S/ACE2 interaction using reactive force field simulations confirmed

67

close proximity and putative charge interactions between R403 in the SARS-CoV-2 S with E37

68

in the human ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1b). These analyses predicted that mutation of T403R

69

significantly strengthens the ability of the RaTG13 S protein to bind human ACE2 (Fig. 1c,

70

Extended Data Movies 1 and 2).

71

To verify the functional importance of residue 403 for ACE2 usage by CoV S proteins, we

72

used VSV particles (VSVpp) pseudotyped with parental and mutant S proteins. Mutation of

73

R403T reduced the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to mediate entry of VSVpp into Caco-

74

2 cells by 40% (Fig. 2a, b). Strikingly, the T403R change enhanced the infectiousness of

75

VSVpp carrying the RaTG13 S ~30-fold, while substitution of T403A introduced as control

76

had no enhancing effect (Fig. 2b). Cell-to-cell fusion assays showed that coexpression of the

77

SARS-CoV-2 S and human ACE2 resulted in the formation of large syncytia (Extended Data

78

Fig. 1). The parental and T403A RaTG13 S did not lead to significant fusion but significant

79

syncytia formation was observed for the T403R RaTG13 S (Extended Data Fig. 1). Western

80

blot analyses showed that the mutant S proteins were efficiently expressed and incorporated

81

into VSVpp, albeit the SARS-CoV-2 R403T S with reduced efficiency (Extended Data Fig.

82

2). In line with the VSVpp results, complementation of a full-length recombinant SARS-CoV-

83

2 lacking the S ORF (SCoV-2ΔS) in ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells with wildtype (WT)

84

SARS-CoV-2 S led to virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) indicating successful virus

85

production and propagation (Fig. 2c). Mutation of R403T in the SARS-CoV-2 S reduced CPE.

86

The WT and T403A RaTG13 S were entirely unable to complement SCoV-2ΔS, while the

87

T403R RaTG13 S resulted in significant CPE. Expression of a Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) from

88

S variant complemented recombinant SCoV2ΔS-GLuc confirmed the importance of R403 for

89

viral spread (Fig. 2d).

90

Coronavirus entry is a multi-step process and critically dependent on proteolytic processing

91

of the S protein15. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer with ACE2 promotes

92

proteolytic processing16,17. Western blot analysis revealed that ACE2 coexpression induces

93

efficient cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 and T403R RaTG13 S proteins to S2, while cleavage

94

of the WT and T403A RaTG13 S proteins remained inefficient (Extended Data Fig. 3). R403

95

generates a potential RGD integrin binding site in the viral Spike protein and it is under debate

96

whether the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S to use integrins as viral attachment factors may play

97

a role in its high infectiousness18,19. The integrin inhibitor ATN-161 had no significant effect

98

on SARS-CoV-2 or T403R RaTG13 S-mediated infection (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Thus,

99

the enhancing effect of the T403R mutation on the ability of RaTG13 S to infect human cells

100

seems to be due to increased interaction with ACE2 rather than utilization of integrins. Taken

101

together, our results demonstrate that mutation of T403R strongly enhances the ability of the

102

bat RaTG13 S protein to utilize ACE2 for infection of human cells.

103

To assess whether the T403R change might allow the bat CoV RaTG13 to spread to different

104

human organs, we performed infection studies using intestinal organoids derived from

105

pluripotent stem cells. The parental SARS-CoV-2 S protein allowed efficient infection of gut

106

organoids20 and the R403T change had modest attenuating effects (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig.

107

5). In contrast, the parental RaTG13 S protein did not result in significant VSVpp infection,

108

while the corresponding T403R mutant allowed significant infection of human intestinal cells

109

(Fig. 3; Extended Data Fig. 5).

110

To examine the species-specificity of receptor usage by SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S

111

proteins, we overexpressed human and bat derived ACE2 in HEK293T cells and examined

112

their susceptibility to S-mediated VSVpp infection. The WT SARS-CoV-2 and the T403R

113

RaTG13 S proteins allowed efficient entry into cells overexpressing human ACE2, while the

114

parental RaTG13 S protein was poorly active (Fig. 4a). Both WT SARS-CoV-2 S and (to a

115

lesser extent) R403T SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were also capable of using bat (Rhinolophus

116

affinis) ACE2 for viral entry although the overall infection rates were low (Fig. 4a, Extended

117

Data Fig. 6). In contrast, the RaTG13 S proteins were unable to use bat ACE2 for infection

118

suggesting that RaTG13 might use an alternative receptor for infection of bat cells. The results

119

agree with the previous finding that RaTG13 S is able to use human ACE2 to some extent if

120

overexpressed21 but further demonstrate that the T403R greatly enhances this function and is

121

required for utilization of endogenously expressed human ACE2.

122

To validate the results obtained with human HEK293T cells, we utilized the lung epithelial

123

cell line Tb1 Lu1 of Tadarida brasiliensis (Bat31)22. In agreement with the previous finding

124

that this cell line lacks endogenous ACE2 expression, it did not support infection by CoV S

125

proteins (Fig. 4b). Engineered expression of human ACE2 rendered Lu 1 highly susceptible to

126

infection mediated by SARS-CoV-2 and the T403R RaTG13 S proteins (Fig. 4b). In

127

comparison, entry via the R403T SARS-CoV-2 S was strongly attenuated and the parental and

128

T403A RaTG13 S proteins were unable to mediate significant VSV-pp infection.

129

Our results demonstrate that a single amino acid change of T403R allows RaTG13, the

130

closest known bat relative of SARS-CoV-2, to utilize human ACE2 for viral entry. The strong

131

enhancing effect of the T403R change on RaTG13 S function came as surprise since five of six

132

different residues proposed to be critical for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD interaction with human

133

ACE2 are not conserved in RaTG13 S12,23. A very recent study proposed that residue 501 plays

134

a key role in the ability of RaTG13 S to use human ACE2 for viral entry24 but the reported

135

enhancing effect of changes at position 501 was weaker than that observed for the T403R

136

change analysed in the present study. However, the previous finding that numerous residues in

137

the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD are involved in the interaction with the human ACE2 orthologue

138

explains why the R403T substitution only moderately reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has

139

been shown that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S shows higher homology to the corresponding

140

region of the pangolin CoV S protein than to RaTG136,7. Whether or not this is a consequence

141

of recombination or convergent evolution is under debate25,26. Notably, the Pan CoV-S protein

142

also contains a positive residue (K) at position 403 (Fig. 1a) and is capable of utilizing human

143

ACE2 for infection. Altogether our results suggest that a positive residue at position 403 in the

144

S protein was most likely a prerequisite for efficient zoonotic transmission and pandemic

145

spread of SARS-CoV-2. We found that a positively charged residue at the corresponding

146

position is present in the S proteins of the great majority of RaTG13-related bat coronaviruses

147

(Extended Data Fig. 7) raising the possibility that many bat sarbecoviruses, including the

148

unknown precursor of SARC-CoV-2, are fitter for zoonotic transmission than RaTG13.

Cloning of SARS-CoV-2 ΔS bacmid. An anonymized residual respiratory swab sample from

196

a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection was used as a template for genome amplification. Total

197

nucleic acids were extracted on an automated Qiagen EZ1 robotic workstation using the Qiagen

198

EZ1 virus mini kit v2.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic viral RNA was

199

reverse transcribed using the NEB LunaScript RT SuperMix Kit according to the

200

manufacturer’s protocol. Four overlapping fragments covering the entire viral genome were

201

amplified using the NEB Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. The resulting amplicons were

202

assembled with a modified pBeloBAC11 backbone, containing CMV and T7 promotors as well

203

as the HDV ribozyme and bGH polyA signal, using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly

204

Cloning Kit. Assembled DNA was electroporated into E. coli GS1783 strain and resulting

205

clones of pBelo-SARSARS-CoV-2 were confirmed by restriction digestion and next

206

generation sequencing. The viral Spike gene was replaced with a kanamycin-cassette flanked

207

by SacII restriction sites by homologous recombination using the Lambda-Red Recombination

208

System30. The bacmid was linearized with the restriction enzyme SacII, and EGFP or GLuc

209

reporter cassettes were introduced instead of Spike using the the NEBuilder HiFi DNA

Transfections. Plasmid DNA was transfected using either calcium phosphate transfection or

222

Polyethylenimine (PEI, 1 mg/ml in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturers

223

recommendations or as described previously31.

224

Pseudoparticle production. To produce pseudotyped VSVΔG-GFP particles, 6*106 HEK 293

225

T cells were seeded 18 hours before transfection in 10 cm dishes. The cells were transfected

226

with 15 µg of a glycoprotein expressing vector using PEI (PEI, 1 mg/ml in H2O, Sigma-

227

Aldrich). Twenty-four hours post transfection, the cells were infected with VSVΔG-GFP

228

particles pseudotyped with VSV G at a MOI of 3. One hour post-infection, the inoculum was

229

removed. Pseudotyped VSVΔG-GFP particles were harvested 16 hours post infection. Cell

230

debris were pelleted and removed by centrifugation (500 g, 4 °C, 5 min). Residual input

231

particles carrying VSV-G were blocked by adding 10 % (v/v) of I1 Hybridoma Supernatant

232

(I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC) to the cell culture supernatant.

Whole-cell and cell free lysates. Whole-cell lysates were prepared by collecting cells in

234

Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS, Gibco), pelleting (500 g, 4 °C, 5 min), lysing and clearing as

235

previously described31. Total protein concentration of the cleared lysates was measured using
