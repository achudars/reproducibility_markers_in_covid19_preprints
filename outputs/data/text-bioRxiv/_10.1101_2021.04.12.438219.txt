SUMMARY
Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune sensors that, upon activation, induce caspase1 mediated inflammation. Although inflammation is protective, uncontrolled excessive
inflammation can cause inflammatory diseases and is also detrimental in COVID-19
infection. However, the underlying mechanisms that control inflammasome activation are
incompletely understood. Here we report that the leucine rich repeat (LRR) protein
Ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1), which shares homology with LRRs of NOD-like receptor
family pyrin domain (PYD)-containing (NLRP) proteins, attenuates inflammasome
activation. Mechanistically, RNH1 decreased pro-IL1b expression and induced proteasomemediated caspase-1 degradation. Corroborating this, mouse models of monosodium urate
(MSU)-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced endotoxemia, which are dependent on caspase1, respectively showed increased neutrophil infiltration and lethality in Rnh1-/- mice
compared to WT mice. Further, RNH1 protein levels were negatively correlated with
inflammation and disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We propose that
RNH1 is a new inflammasome regulator with relevance to COVID-19 severity.

INTRODUCTION
Innate immune receptors sense invading pathogens or endogenous danger molecules that are
released by dying cells and induce inflammation, which is critical to eliminate pathogens
and to initiate tissue repair (Gong et al., 2020). Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune
receptors that upon activation form multiprotein caspase-1-activating complexes containing
an adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase
activation and recruitment domain) and caspase-1 (Martinon et al., 2009; Schroder and
Tschopp, 2010). Active caspase-1 processes the IL-1 cytokine members IL-1β and IL-18 and
initiates Gasdermin-D (GASMD)-mediated pyroptosis, a form of cell death (Broz and Dixit,
2016). Several NOD-like receptor (NLRs) proteins, as well as HIN200 proteins and Pyrin,
can form inflammasome complexes, namely: NLR family pyrin domain (PYD)-containing
1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, NLRP6, NAIP/NLRC4, AIM2 and Pyrin (Broz and Dixit, 2016;
Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). The NLR family is characterized by the presence of a central
nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which is commonly flanked by
C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and N-terminal CARD or pyrin (PYD) domains.
LRRs are believed to function in ligand sensing and autoregulation, whereas CARD and
PYD domains mediate homotypic protein-protein interactions for downstream signaling.
Inflammasomes are activated after sensing host-derived danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs), bacterial toxins, nucleic acids, pathogenic crystals, and altered cellular
components (Gong et al., 2020; Henao-Mejia et al., 2014).
Inflammasomes are critical to mount immune responses, however uncontrolled
inflammasome activation is associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases
including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Strowig et al., 2012; van den Berg and
Velde, 2020). COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is associated with significant mortality and has resulted in more than 2

million deaths worldwide until now. Clinical manifestation of patients with COVID-19
include pulmonary failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiac
injury (Huang et al., 2020a). Several studies suggest that overproduction of proinflammatory
cytokines correlates with increased disease severity and poor prognosis in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients (Jose and Manuel, 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020). In this
line, recent studies reported inflammasome activation in severe COVID-19 patients and
suggested that increased inflammasome activation would potentially mediate disease
progression in COVID-19 (Kroemer et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021; Toldo et al., 2020;
van den Berg and Velde, 2020). It is therefore important to understand molecules that control
and resolve the overactivation of inflammasomes and inflammation in order to develop
therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and other inflammatory disorders.
Ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1/RI), also known as Ribonuclease/Angiogenin Inhibitor, is a
LRR protein (Dickson et al., 2005). It is present in the cytosol but can also be found in the
nucleus and mitochondria (Furia et al., 2011). The known function of RNH1 is to bind to
pancreatic-type ribonucleases with femtomolar affinity and render them inactive (Dickson
et al., 2005). In addition, several roles of RNH1 have been reported such as inhibiting
oxidative damage (Dickson et al., 2005; Monti et al., 2007), inhibiting angiogenin (ANG)
mediated neovascularization and stemness of haematopoietic stem cells (Dickson et al.,
2009; Goncalves et al., 2016), binding and inhibition of ER stress sensor IRE1 activity
(Tavernier et al., 2018), inhibiting of tiRNA degradation (Yamasaki et al., 2009), and
mediate resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitor toxicity in cancer cell lines (Zhu et al.,
2013). However, the relevance of these observations in vivo still needs to be validated. We
recently reported that RNH1 is important for embryonic erythropoiesis in mice, suggesting
possible additional roles for RNH1 in mammalian physiology (Chennupati et al., 2018).
RNH1 was the first cytosolic protein identified to possess LRRs (Dickson et al., 2005). The

LRRs are present in a large family of proteins that display of vast surface areas to foster
protein-protein and protein–ligand interactions (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1993). LRR proteins
are classified into subfamilies based on the organism of origin, cellular localization, LRR
consensus sequence and length. To date, seven LRR subfamilies of proteins have been
described: bacterial, ribonuclease inhibitor–like, cysteine-containing, SDS22, plant-specific,
typical, and small (Dickson et al., 2005; Kobe and Kajava, 2001; Matsushima et al., 2010).
Interestingly, members of the RNH1-like subfamily are intracellular proteins and include
human MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), Ran GTPase activating protein from
Saccharomyces pombe (RANGAP1), and other NLRs (Dickson et al., 2005). Further, the
LRRs of RNH1 are very similar to those of NLRP proteins (Ng et al., 2011). Whether RNH1
plays a role in NLRP inflammasome activation is currently unclear.

In this study, we investigated the role of RNH1 in inflammation and found that RNH1
inhibits inflammasome activation by proteasome-mediated degradation of the downstream
effector molecule caspase-1. Supporting this, Rnh1-/- mice displayed higher inflammasomedependent activation of caspase-1. Interestingly, we also found that RNH1 expression in
buffy coat and lung biopsies negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2-mediated
inflammation and severety in COVID-19 patients. Collectively, these findings establish
RNH1 as a previously unidentified negative regulator of inflammasome activation, which
might play a role in human inflammatory diseases including SARS-CoV-2 mediated
inflammation and pathology.

RESULTS
RNH1 is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells and is increased under
inflammatory conditions.
Human RNH1 protein consists of 15 LRR repeats whose sequence and organization are
similar to those present in multiple NLRP proteins (Figure 1A) (Hoss et al., 2019; Ng et al.,
2011). RNH1 consists exclusively of LRRs and lacks functional domains present at the N.terminus of NLRP proteins (Figure 1B). LRRs in NLRP family proteins are believed to
function in ligand sensing and autoregulation (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). Since NLRPs
form inflammasome complexes and induce inflammation, we investigated the role of RNH1
in inflammasome activation. We stained healthy human bone marrow biopsies for RNH1
and found that RNH1 is expressed at higher levels in myeloid cells compared to other
hematopoietic cell types such as lymphocytes and erythrocytes (Figure 1C). Further, RNH1
protein expression is elevated in bone marrow biopsies of patients with confirmed systemic
inflammation (see methods) (Figure 1D). In support of this observation, RNH1 protein
levels in human monocyte cell line (THP1 cells) and primary mouse bone marrow derived
macrophages (BMDM) were moderately increased upon stimulation with the TLR1/2 ligand
Pam3Cysk4 and the TLR4 ligand LPS, respectively (Figure 1E and F). Collectively, these
results suggest that RNH1 is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells and might play a role
in inflammation.
Absence of RNH1 increases NLRP3 inflammasome activation
The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most studied and is activated by several pathogens as well
as danger stimuli (Broz and Dixit, 2016). To investigate the role of RNH1 in NLRP3
inflammasome activation, we generated RNH1-deficient (RNH1-KO) THP1 cells using the
CRISPR/cas9 system and stimulated them with NLRP3 agonists. RNH1-KO THP1 cells
showed increased mature IL-1β production and caspase-1 cleavage compared to wildtype

cells (Figure 2A and 2B). shRNA knockdown studies in THP1 also showed similar results
(Supplementary Figure 1A and B). Since human and mouse RNH1 share 72.8% homology
at the protein level, we also checked NLRP3 activation in mouse-derived immortalized
macrophages (iMAC cells). RNH1-KO iMAC cells also showed increased caspase-1
cleavage and mature IL-1β production in response to NLRP3 agonists (Figure 2C and 2D).
This data suggests that RNH1 limits inflammasome activation in both human and mouse.
Inflammasome activation triggers pyroptosis, a type of inflammatory cell death (Miao et al.,
2011). We indeed observed increased cell death in RNH1-KO cells compared to WT cells
upon NLRP3 activation (Figure 2E and 2F). In order to confirm the inhibitory function of
RNH1 on inflammasome activation, we performed a transient reconstitution of RNH1 in
RNH1-KO THP1 cells using lentiviral transduction, followed by stimulation with NLRP3
agonists. Reconstitution of RNH1 caused a decrease in IL-1β secretion (Figure 2G and
2H). Further, we also generated stable RNH1 over-expressing THP1 cells and stimulated
them with NLRP3 agonists. RNH1 overexpression decreased IL-1β secretion confirming
that RNH1 negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Figure 2I and 2J). In
line with increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, RNH1-KO THP1 cells also showed
enhanced ASC speck formation upon nigericin stimulation, which is a direct indicator of
inflammasome activation (Stutz et al., 2013) (Figure 2K and 2L). Collectively, these results
suggest that RNH1 dampens NLPR3 inflammasome activation.
RNH1 regulates NF-kB activation and is involved in the priming of NLRP3
Activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurs in two steps (Latz et
al., 2013). The priming step requires activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), e.g. when
LPS binds to TLR4, which upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1b. The second step requires a
signal initiated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or DAMPs, which leads
to NLRP3 activation and formation of an inflammasome complex with ASC and Caspase-1

(Latz et al., 2013). We found increased pro-IL-1b in RNH1-KO cells suggesting that RNH1
might also be involved in reducing the priming signal (Figure 2B and 2D). To further
understand this, wildtype and RNH1-KO THP1 cells were stimulated with the TLR2 ligand
Pam3CSK4. RNH1-KO cells showed increased pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 expression in both
time- and Pam3CSK4 concentration-dependent manner, supporting a role of RNH1 in
priming, (Figure 3A and 3B). RNH1-KO cells displayed increased NF-κB p100 activation
at 40, 60 and 180 min after Pam3CSK4 treatment (Figure 3C). In addition, they also showed
decreased levels of the IκBa and increased levels of phospho-IκBa compared to wildtype
cells (Figure 3C). To further confirm NF-κB activation, we monitored the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and found that RNH1-KO cells exhibited enhanced secretion of
TNF and IL-6 compared to wildtype cells (Figure 3D and E). Collectively, these results
suggest that RNH1 reduces NF-κB activation and therefore reduces the priming step.
RNH1 deficiency increases AIM2 and NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation
To check whether RNH1 is also involved in activation of AIM2 and NAIP/NLRC4
inflammasomes, we stimulated wildtype and RNH1-KO THP1 cells with cytosolic dsDNA
(pdA:dT) and flagellin, respectively. Interestingly, we found increased mature IL-1β
production and caspase-1 cleavage in RNH1-KO compared to wildtype cells (Figure 3F and
3G), suggesting increased AIM2 and NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation in RNH1-KO
THP1 cells. We also found increased AIM2 inflammasome activation in mouse iMAC cells,
however there was no significant increase in cytosolic flagellin-induced NAIP/NLRC4
inflammasome activation (Figure 3H and 3I). To further confirm the inflammasome
activation, we checked ASC oligomerization by monitoring the partition of ASC in insoluble
fractions (Lugrin and Martinon, 2017). In line with the above results, loss of RNH1 increased
ASC oligomerization in response to NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activators
(Supplementary Figure 2A). We also found increased cell death in RNH1-KO cells by

AIM2 activation (Supplementary Figure 2B and 2C). Together, these results suggest that
loss of RNH1 also negatively regulates AIM2 and NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation.
RNH1 mediates degradation of caspase-1 through the proteasome
Since RNH1 inhibits the activation of several inflammasomes (NLRP3, AIM2 and
NAIP/NLRC4), it could do so by acting on a common downstream effector. Interestingly,
caspase-1 protein levels were elevated in RNH1-KO cells at steady state (Figure 4A). A
qPCR analysis indicated that RNH1 does not regulate caspase-1 at the transcriptional level
(Figure 4B). To check whether RNH1 regulate caspase-1 expression at the translation or
post-translational levels, we performed chase experiments using actinomycin‐D,
cycloheximide (CHX) and the proteasome inhibitor MG‐132 in wildtype and RNH1-KO
THP1 cells. Actinomycin‐D and CHX inhibits transcription and translation respectively.
Actinomycin‐D and CHX treatment decreased caspase-1 protein levels in both wildtype and
RNH1-KO cells with similar kinetics (Figure 4C and D). Interestingly, proteasome
blockade with MG‐132 increased caspase-1 protein levels in WT cells while levels were not
further increased in RNH1-KO cells, suggesting that loss of RNH1 might stabilize caspase1 protein levels by inhibiting proteasome mediated degradation (Figure 4E). To test this
further, we expressed full length Flag-caspase-1 in the presence or absence of GFP-RNH1
in HEK293T cells. Strikingly, caspase-1 protein levels decreased with increasing
concentration of RNH1, an effect that was blocked in the presence of MG‐132 (Figure 4F).
It has been reported that overexpression of caspase-1 induces self-cleavage (Li et al., 2008),
however, we did not observe caspase-1 self-cleavage at the concentration that we used in
our experiments. Interestingly, we also did not observe a similar decrease in another
protease, OMI/HTRA2 (Vande Walle et al., 2008) in the presence of RNH1 (Figure 4G),
suggesting that RNH1 might specifically mediate proteasomal degradation of caspase-1 or
of a defined set of proteins. Since proteins must be ubiquitinated for proteasome mediated

degradation, we checked caspase-1 ubiquitination (Ub) in wildtype and RNH1-KO THP1
cells by immunoprecipitating ubiquitin. Interestingly, the ratio of poly-Ub-caspase-1 and
total caspase-1 levels were decreased in RNH1-KO cells (Figure 4H and I), suggesting
that absence of RNH1 might decrease caspase-1 ubiquitination. We attempted to co-express
HA-tagged ubiquitin and caspase-1 in the presence or absence of RNH1 in HEK293T cells.
However, in the presence of RNH1, caspase-1 was found to be completely degraded, so we
could not study caspase-1 ubiquitination in the presence of RNH1 (data not shown).
Collectively, these results suggest that RNH1 increases proteasome-mediated caspase-1
degradation, possibly through controlling ubiquitination of caspase-1.
Loss of RNH1 in mice increases inflammation and lethality upon inflammasome
activation
Complete deletion of Rnh1 leads to embryonic lethality in mice (Chennupati et al., 2018), so
we generated Rnh1 conditional knockout mice (Rnh1fl/fl) to understand the in vivo relevance
of our results (Figure 5A). We crossed Rnh1fl/fl mice with transgenic interferon-inducible
Mx1-Cre mice to generate an inducible Rnh1-/- mouse model (Rnh1

fl/f;Mx1-Tg+

).

Administration of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) into Rnh1 fl/f;Mx1-Tg+ mice lead to
cre-recombination and complete deletion of RNH1 protein expression in hematopoietic
organs such as the bone marrow (BM), which we refer to as Rnh1-/- (Figure 5B and C). We
generated BM-derived macrophages (BMDM) from WT (Rnh1fl/fl) and Rnh1-/- mice and
stimulated them with inflammasome activators. As seen above in cell lines, loss of RNH1 in
primary mouse BMDMs lead to increased mature IL-1β production and caspase-1 cleavage
compared to wildtype cells upon stimulation with NLRP3, AIM2 and NAIP/NLRC4
agonists (Figure 5D and E). To check the in vivo role of Rnh1 in inflammasome activation,
we performed mouse models of caspase-1-dependent MSU-induced peritonitis and LPSinduced lethality mouse models (Li et al., 1995; Man et al., 2017; Martinon et al., 2006)

(Figure 5F). Since Mx1-Cre activation also deletes genes in non-haematopoietic organs
(Kühn et al., 1995), we transplanted WT (Rnh1fl/fl) and Rnh1-/- (Rnh1fl/fl Mx1-Cre+) bone
marrow into irradiated CD45.1 congenic mice to exclude Rnh1 effects from nonhematopoietic cells. After 8 weeks we checked reconstitution levels in WT and Rnh1-/- BM
transplanted CD45.1 congenic mice. We found comparable reconstitution in WT and Rnh1/-

BM transplanted CD45.1 congenic mice (Figure 5G). Rnh1 was deleted by giving three

rounds of 200 μg of polyI:C injections. Four days after the last injection mice were analyzed
for peripheral blood parameters. At this time point, we observed no major difference in
leukocyte numbers (Figure 5H), hemoglobin and red blood cell count (data not shown)
between WT and Rnh1-/- BM transplanted CD45.1 congenic mice. In a MSU-induced model
of peritonitis, Rnh1-/- mice showed increased neutrophil infiltration in the peritoneal cavity
compared to WT mice (Figure 5I). Consistent with this, we also found increased IL-1b
production in the peritoneal lavage of Rnh1-/- mice compared to WT mice (Figure 5J). We
next challenged mice with LPS at 10 mg/kg, a dose that killed Rnh1-/- mice but not WT mice
that all survived this dose of LPS (Figure 5K). Altogether, these results demonstrate that
Rnh1 deficiency promotes excessive inflammasome activation and increases inflammation.
RNH1 is negatively associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients
Recent studies suggest that pronounced inflammation and inflammasome activation in
patients with COVID-19 correlates with increased disease severity and poor prognosis
(Ferreira et al., 2021; Jose and Manuel, 2020; Kroemer et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Mehta
et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021; Toldo et al., 2020; van den Berg and Velde, 2020). Since
our results suggest that RNH1 negatively regulates NFkB and inflammasome activation, we
investigated RNH1 levels in COVID-19 patients. Buffy coat samples from critically ill
COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (n= 17) and COVID-19 patients
admitted to general COVID-19 ward (n=11 patients) were analyzed for RNH1 protein

expression by western blot (see methods). Disease severity of these patients is estabilished
by comorbidity data and routine clinical parameters, such as C-reactive protein
(Supplementary Table 1). Strikingly, ICU COVID-19 patients had significant less RNH1
expression when compared to general ward COVID-19 patients (Figure 6A,B and
Supplementary Figure 3). The decrease of RNH1 expression in ICU patients is unlikely to
reflect leukocyte numbers, since leukocyte numbers were ranther increased in ICU patients
compared to general ward COVID-19 patients (Supplementary Table 1). To further support
these findings, we analyzed RNH1 expression with an anti-RNH1 antibody in lung sections
of patients from an independent study performed in the UK, who deceased either from
COVID-19 (n = 6) or from non-viral causes (n =11) (.Supplementary Table 1). In line with
the data above, RNH1 expression is largely absent in lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients,
whereas patients having succumbed to non-viral causes do show RNH1 staining in
infiltrating cells in the lung (Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure 4). These data show
loss of RNH1 expression in immune cells during severe COVID-19, which may suggest a
crucial role for RNH1 in controlling severe inflammation.

Recent studies document the critical role for monocytes and macrophages in SARS-CoV-2
infection (Desai et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2021). To check whether RNH1 affects SARSCoV-2 infection rate in macrophages, we infected WT and RNH1-KO macrophages
differentiated from THP1 monocytes with SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles (Hoffmann et
al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020). These pseudoviral particles express SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
together with enhanced GFP (eGFP) as a reporter. Interestingly, we found increased eGFP+
cells in RNH1-KO cells compared to WT cells (Figure 6D). At a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.25, we observed 1% of RNH1-KO cell were positive for eGFP cells. This

0.25 MOI and very few (<0.5%) at 1MOI. These results suggest that RNH1-KO cells are
more susceptible to infection (Figure 6D). Collectively, our findings suggest that decreased
expression of RNH1 strongly correlates with severity and increased inflammation in
COVID-19 patients, and possibly increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DISCUSSION
Inflammasomes are multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes which, upon activation, induce
potent inflammation and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis (Broz and Dixit, 2016). This
process is critical for pathogen clearance and to maintain tissue homeostasis. However,
uncontrolled inflammasome activation leads to excessive inflammation and tissue
destruction, which is a prime cause for several inflammatory, autoimmune and
autoinflammatory diseases (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2011; Strowig et al., 2012). Therefore,
precise regulation of inflammasome signaling is necessary to prevent collateral damage but
still prevent pathogen insurgence. Our results unravel a new mechanism involving RNH1
acting as a negative regulator of inflammasome activation. Conventionally, RNH1 is known
to inhibit ribonucleases and protect RNA from degradation (Dickson et al., 2005). However,
in Rnh1-ko mice that are embryonically lethal because of marked defects in erythropoiesis,
the defect seems to originate from decreased translation of the transcriptional erythropoiesis
regulator GATA-1 rather than detectable effects on mRNA levels, suggesting that RNH1
fulfills functions beyond inhibition of ribonucleases (Chennupati et al., 2018). This is also
supported by the present study in which RNH1 mainly exerts post-translational effects.

The RNH1 protein consists of only LRRs and evolved via exon duplication (Haigis et al.,
2002). Interestingly, LRRs of RNH1 share homology with the LRRs of NLRs, yet the
function of RNH1 in NLR signaling is not known. Although, RNH1 is a ubiquitously
expressed protein (Dickson et al., 2005), we demonstrated that it is highly expressed in

myeloid cells and its expression is increased under inflammatory conditions, pointing to a
potential role in regulating inflammation. Interestingly, we found that RNH1-deleted
macrophages increased IL-1b production, caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis in response to
NLRP3 agonists, suggesting that RNH1 can potentially inhibit NLRP3-induced
inflammation. Increased expression of RNH1 in inflammatory conditions might be a
compensatory mechanism to dampen inflammation. In addition, we identified increased NFκB signaling and also increased expression of pro-IL-1b and NLRP3 expression in the
absence of RNH1, which clearly indicates that RNH1 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome
activation at the priming step as well as during the activating signal. We did not investigate
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which play a role in TLR induced
inflammation (Arthur and Ley, 2013), so we cannot exclude that the MAPK pathway may
mediated priming in RNH1-deleted cells. A report suggests that reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are involved both in priming and in NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Zhou et al.,
2010). RNH1 protein contains numerous cysteine residues (e.g. 32 in human RNH1), whose
sulfhydryl groups might play a structural role and were also shown to protect from oxidative
damage (Cui et al., 2003; Dickson et al., 2005). Thus, increased ROS production in the
absence of RNH1 might be responsible for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, loss
of RNH1 also increased AIM2 and NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation, which do not
require ROS. Therefore, these observations do not substantiate a major anti-ROS role of
RNH1 to suppress activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Further studies are necessary to
exclude a role of ROS in RNH1-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome regulation. Taken
together, our data define RNH1 as an inhibitor of inflammasome activation. Whether RNH1
also inhibits non-canonical inflammasomes remains to be studied.

In line with the increased canonical inflammasome activation and higher caspase-1 activity
in RNH1-KO cells, we observed higher caspase-1 protein levels in RNH1-KO cells
compared to WT. Caspase-1 is a cysteine protease acting downstream of inflammasome
activation. Upon activation, pro-caspase-1 is cleaved into two subunits (p10 and p20) and
mediates proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 while promoting pyroptosis by
cleaving gasdermin (Broz and Dixit, 2016). Few studies report mechanisms for the inhibition
of caspase-1 function. Flightless-I binding could inhibit caspase-1 cleavage (Jin et al., 1AD;
Li et al., 2008) and CARD only protein -1 (COP-1) was also shown to interact with the
CARD domain of caspase-1 and inhibit caspase-1 interaction with ASC (Druilhe et al., 2001;
Pedraza-Alva et al., 2015). However, to our knowledge, regulation of caspase-1 protein
levels as found in the present study were not previously reported. Further, we demonstrated
that RNH1 promotes proteasome-mediated caspase-1 protein degradation, which was
rescued by inhibiting proteasome function. How RNH1 regulates proteasome-mediated
caspase-1 degradation requires further investigation, but we did observe reduced
ubiquitination of caspase-1 in the absence of RNH1. Caspase-1-deficient mice are resistant
to LPS-induced lethality and MSU-induced peritonitis (Man et al., 2017; Martinon et al.,
2006). Supporting a role for RNH1 in inflammasome activation and caspase-1 activity,
Rnh1-/- mice showed markedly increased susceptibility to LPS-induced lethality. Further,
Rnh1-/- mice also displayed increased neutrophil infiltration in MSU-induced peritonitis.
These results mirror results obtained in vitro. Collectively, our study unravels a significant
role of RNH1 in dampening inflammasome activation and demonstrates a previously
unidentified regulation of caspase-1 through proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 6E).

2020). Recent studies have demonstrated a correlation of increased inflammasome activation
and disease severity in COVID-19 patients (Toldo et al., 2020; van den Berg and Velde,
2020). We showed that RNH1-KO THP1 cells are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV2 pseudo virus. Further, we identified a significant decrease in RNH1 protein expression in
severe ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients compared to less severe general ward-admitted
COVID-19 patients, suggesting that RNH1 expression negatively correlates with COVID19 disease severity. This is contrary to what we have shown in inflammatory conditions,
where increased RNH1 expression might be a compensatory mechanisms to inhibit
inflammation (Figure 1D). So it is unclear what drives the reduced expression of RNH1 in
severe COVID-19 pathology, but understanding whether this is a common feature of severe
inflammation, or of infection-driven inflammation, and what causes it will be of interest. In
addition, these results were confirmed in an independent COVID-19 patient cohort using
post-mortem lung tissue. We observed decreased RNH1 protein expression in COVID-19
lung sections compared to lungs from patients who died of non-viral causes.

These results have direct clinical implication. First, RNH1 expression in blood samples
could be used as a marker for disease severity in COVID-19 patients, and potentially other
inflammatory conditions including sepsis. Second, small molecules or drugs that could
enhance RNH1 expression might be beneficial for COVID-19 and other inflammatory
disease patients. Overall, the in vitro as well as in vivo mouse models along with human
clinical data strongly suggest a potentially important role for RNH1 in limiting severe
inflammation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Details of Rnh1 conditional-knockout mice generation and mouse experiments
Rnh1 conditional-knockout (Rnh1fl/fl) mice were generated on a C57BL/6 background. Rnh1

We crossed Rnh1fl/fl mice with Mx1-Cre mouse strain (Jackson: 002527) to generate
inducible mouse model (Rnh1fl/fl Mx1-Cre+). To exclude non-haematopoietic deletion, total
bone marrow (BM) was isolated from wildtype (Rnh1fl/fl) or Rnh1fl/fl Mx1-Cre+ mice and
transplanted (7x106 BM cells) into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ congenic recipient mice (8
weeks old male mice) (B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyCrl, from Charles river). After 8 weeks of
reconstitution, Rnh1 was excised by giving three rounds of 200 μg poly(I:C) (Invivogen)
using intraperitoneal injections once in two days. We used these mice for MSU induced
peritonitis model and LPS lethality model. To detect Rnh1 deletion after Cre-recombination,
we used third primer 5’-AAGACCCATCCAGAGCCGAGG-3’ (reverse in the distal intron
region) in above mentioned PCR reaction using DNA form BM cells, which amplifies 365
bp size (Figure 5B) and also western blot was performed in BM cells to check RNH1 protein
expression (Figure 5C). Mouse peripheral blood was taken from the lateral tail vein with an
EDTA coated Microvette 100 K3E (Sarstedt, 20.1278). Full blood counts were measured on
an IDEXX ProCyte DxTM Hematology Analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories). The genotypes of
the mice could not be blinded or randomized, due to the experimental design. All groups of
mice (experimental and control mice) were age- and sex-matched. We used littermates for
our experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Swiss Federal Veterinary
Office (Bern, Switzerland) under valid authorization (BE39/16). Mice were handled
according to Swiss Federal Veterinary Office guidelines under valid authorization. Mouse
strains are available upon request.

MSU-induced peritonitis model
Mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with sterile PBS or MSU (1 mg/mouse) to induce
peritonitis. After 12 h mice were euthanized by CO2-asphyxiation and the peritoneal cavity
was flushed with sterile PBS. The lavage fluid was centrifuged and supernatants were
analyzed by ELISA for IL-1β production and the pelleted cells were analyzed for the influx
of neutrophils (CD45+, Ly-6G+, CD11b+) by BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Data were analysed by using FlowJo (version 9.3.1, TreeStar Inc) software.
LPS-induced septic shock
Mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with LPS (10 mg/kg) or PBS and survival rates
were monitored.
Histopathology and bone marrow biopsies
Healthy human controls and inflammatory disease patients bone marrow biopsies were
obtained from Swiss MDS Registry. Biopsies were stained with human RNH1 antibody from
Prestige Antibodies® Sigma (HPA039223). These studies were approved by the competent
local human ethics committee (ID:2017-00734).

Laboratories), at 37 °C and 5% CO2. BMDMs were generated by established protocols.
Briefly, total bone marrow cells were isolated from the femur and tibias of mice and
differentiated into macrophages for 7 days in complete DMEM medium (500 mL,
ThermoFisher) supplemented with M-CSF (40 ng/mL) (315-02, Peprotech).
Reagents and plasmids
We purchased Nigericin (N7143), pdA:dT (poly(dA-dT)•poly(dT-dA)) sodium salt (P0883),
Gramicidin A (G5002 ) , PMA (P1585), Actinomycin D and Cycloheximide from SigmaAldrich, Ultra-pure flagellin (AG-40B-0025) from Adipogen. ultrapure LPS (LPS-EK),
MSU (tlrl-msu) and Pam3Cysk4 (tlrl-pms) from Invivogen.
Cloning of Full-length Caspase-1 and OMI were amplified by PCR and sub-cloned into the
mammalian expression vectors pCR3 in frame with the N-terminal flag tags. Full-length
RNH1-Flag construct was described previously(Chennupati et al., 2018). To construct full
length GFP-RNH1 plasmid a human RNH1-full coding sequence (ORIGEN RC 200082)
insert was cloned into the entry vector pENTR4-GFP-C1 (W392-1, Addgene) and then
recombined into the destination vector pLenti CMV Blast DEST (706-1, Addgene) plasmid,
using the Gateway cloning method.
Stimulation Experiments
All cells were stimulated at a density of 1×106 cells per ml as describe previously (Allam et
al., 2014) Briefly, for inflammasome studies THP1 cells were treated with PMA (100ng/ml)
to differentiate into macrophages or BMDMs and iMACs were pre-stimulated for 3 hours
with 100 ng/mL of ultrapure LPS. Later cells were stimulated with 1 hour with 5uM of
Nigericin or 5µg/mL of pdA:dT, 30µg/mL of Gramicidin A, 300µg/mL MSU and 200ng/mL

analyzed by ELISA for cytokine secretion or cells were lysed for immunoblot analysis.
CRISPR/CAS9-mediated RNH1-knockout THP1 and iMAC cell line generation
RNH1-KO THP1 cells (human monocytic cell line) were generated as described previously
(Chennupati et al., 2018). For RNH1-KO iMAC cells CRISPR sequences targeting exon 2
(RNH1-KO-1) and exon 3 (RNH1-KO-2) of mouse RNH1 were designed and obtained KO
cells as described previously. Target exon and the seed sequences preceding the protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM) are the following: RNH1-1 oligo 1- 5′-CACCGTCTGA
TCCAGCAATACGAAG-3’;

RNH1-1oligo

TCAGAC-3′; RNH1-2 oligo 1- 5′-CACCGGATAACCCTATGGGGGACGC-3 ′; RNH1-2
oligo 2- 5′-AAACGCGTCCCCCATAGGGTTATCC-3’. All the generated THP1 and
iMAC clones were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Cat#LT07-318). THP1 cells were obtained from ATCC
and iMAC cells were provided by Petr Broz (University of Lausanne).
Generation of stable THP1 cells expressing Flag–RNH1
Flag-RNH1 was further sub cloned into retroviral vector pMSCVpuro (Clontech). Retroviral
vector pMSCVpuro-Flag–RNH1 was co-transfected with the helper plasmids VSV-G and
Hit60 into HEK293T cells using PEI transfection reagent. Culture supernatants containing
recombinant viral particles were harvested and used to infect THP1 cells. To establish stable
cell lines, THP1 cells were selected with puromycin (5ug ml−1) 3 days after infection.
Generation of transient THP1 cells expressing GFP–RNH1
RNH1-KO THP1 cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing RNH1 (pLenti CMV Blast
GFP- RNH1) or the empty vector pLentiCMV-GFP-Blast (659-1, Addgene) as previously
described (Papin et al., 2007). After 48 h post-infection, efficiency was monitored by GFP

assay.
Generation of stable THP1 cells expressing shRNA-RNH1
Various lentiviral shRNA plasmids against RNH1 were purchased from Sigma. THP1 cells
stably expressing shRNA were obtained as previously described.
Immunoblot analysis
Precipitated media supernatants or cell extracts were analyzed by standard immunoblot
techniques. The following antibody were used. Anti-human RNH1 (A9), anti-mouse RNH1
(C10), anti-human ASC (Sc-514414), anti-GAPDH (G9, sc-365062) from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti- human IL-1β antibody (12242), anti-NFkB2 (p100), anti-IkBa, antiPhospho-IkBa, anti-GFP (2555) from Cell signalling. Anti-human Caspase-1 (p20, Bally1), anti-mouse Caspase-1 (p20, AG-20B-0042), anti-NLRP3 (Cryo-2), anti-mouse ASC
(AG-25B-0006) from Adipogen. Anti-mouse IL-1β antibody (AF-401-NA) from R&D.
Anti-b-Actin from Abcam.
TLR priming and NF-κB activation
Wildtype and RNH1-KOTHP1 cells were stimulated with TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4
(500ng/mL) at different time points 3, 6 and 14h or at different doses 100, 500 and 1000
ng/mL for 3h. For NF-κB activation, cells were stimulated at 10, 20, 40, 60 and 180 minutes
by Pam3CSK4 (1000 ng/mL). After stimulation cell lysates were isolated and performed
Western blot.
Caspase-1 expression and ubiquitination
HEK293T cells were treated with or without MG-132 and transfected with full length flagtagged Casapase-1 or OMI/HTAR2 plasmids with or without GFP-tagged RNH1 plasmid as
indicated concentration. At 24 hour, cells were harvested and cell lysates were analyzed by
immunoblot. To check the caspase-1 ubiquitination, WT and RNH1-KO THP1 cells were

resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] Nonidet-P40,
10 mM EDTA). Using these whole cell lysates, immuno- precipitation was performed with
Ubiquitin antibody (Sc-8017, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to Dynabeads Protein G
(10003D, Life Technologies) for 3 hours with rotation at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated proteins
were washed in lysis buffer, eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot
analysis.
Cytokine measurement and LDH assay
Cell supernatants were analyzed for cytokines and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). Human
and mouse IL-1β, TNF and IL-6 cytokine secretion measured by ELISA according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience). LDH was measured by colorimetric NAD linked
assay by in-house developed kit according OPS Diagnostics instructions.

Detection of ASC oligomerization by western blot
We detected ASC oligomerization by western blot as described previously (Lugrin and
Martinon, 2017). Briefly, WT and RNH1-KO THP1 cells were primed with 100 ng of PMA
and treated with Nigericin (5 μM) for 1 hour and Poly(dA:dT) (5 μg), for 5 hours. After
stimulation, cells were detached and lysed on ice cold lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes·KOH, pH
7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and 320 mM sucrose) by
syringing 35 times using a 21G needle. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 8 min at 1,800 x g
and supernatants were collected (30 μL of the supernatants were kept aside to check ASC
expression in the lysates). Supernatants were further diluted two times with lysis buffer and
then centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 min. Next, supernatants were diluted with 1 vol of CHAPS
buffer (20 mM Hepes·KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM PMSF and
0.1% CHAPS) and then centrifuged for 8 min at 5,000 x g. The supernatant was discarded
and the pellet was resuspended in 50μL of CHAPS buffer supplemented with 4mM of

After incubation, samples were centrifuged for 8 min at 5,000 x g, and pellets were
resuspended in SDS sample buffer without reducing agents and western blot was performed.
Detection of ASC Spec formation by confocal microscopy
To further confirm the ASC specks formation, we performed confocal microscopy as
described previously (Di Micco et al., 2016). Briefly, PMA-primed WT and RNH1-KO
THP1 cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates before inflammasome activation.
Next day, cells were stimulated for 1h with Nigericin (5 μM) and fixed with 4% (vol/vol)
PFA (Applichem) for 20 min at room temperature (RT). After fixation, cells were washed 3
times with 1x PBS for 5 min and permeabilize with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 15
min at RT. Cell were washed with 1x PBS and blocked with 4%(w/vol) BSA for 30 min at
RT. After blocking, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies
against ASC (HASC-71, BioLegend). Cells were washed 3 times with washing buffer (1x
PBS and 0.025% of Tween20) for 5 min and incubated for 1h at RT with the Alexa Fluor
secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientific). Cells were washed twice with washing buffer for
5 min and incubated in with DAPI (1 μg/mL) for 1 min. Again, cells were washed and
coverslips were mounted on glass slides using mounting media (ProLong® Gold Antifade).
Images were captured with inverted confocal microscope LSM 710 (Zeiss) and analyzed
with ImageJ across at least 10 fields from three independent experiments.
Actinomycin D, Cycloheximide and MG-132 chase assays
To study Caspase-1 mRNA and protein stability, wildtype and RNH1-KO THP1 cells were
treated with the following inhibitor 3 and 6 Hours. Cell were treated with Actinomycin D
(10 μg/mL), Cycloheximide (75 μg/mL), proteasomal inhibitor MG‐132 (20 μM) to assess

We analysed a total of 28 COVID-19 patients samples from a previously published study
(n= 13) (Spinetti et al., 2020), but with addition of new patients to the cohort (n=15). We
isolated protein samples from buffy coats of COVID-19 patients and analysed RNH1
expression by Western blot. The present study is part of a larger COVID-project
(NCT04510012) and data of some patients were previously investigated regarding immune
functionality in COVID-19 (Spinetti et al., 2020). The study was performed in accordance
with the “Declaration of Helsinki” and approved by the Kantonale Ethikkommission KEK,
Bern, Switzerland, Nr. 2020-00877.
COVID-19 Tissue microarray samples
Post-mortem tissues were collected as part of the ethically approved LoST-SoCC study in
accordance with the “Declaration of Helsinki” and Human Tissue Authority legislation. The
study was approved by the Newcastle North Tyneside 1 research ethics commits
19/NE/0336, IRAS 193937. Non-COVID causes of death were all non-respiratory, noninfectious, obtained from PMs that were done prior to the pandemic and the lungs were
morphologically within normal limits. The original FFPE tissue blocks were taken from
representative samples at post-mortem, formalin fixed and processed as per standard
diagnostic blocks. For tissue microarray (TMA) construction, representative 3mm tissue
cores were cored out of FFPE tissue blocks and re-blocked within a 4x4 format TMA,
sectioned and mounted onto glass slides.Slides were dehydrated and endogenous peroxides
quenched. Antigen retrieval done using TRIS buffer pH9 boiled for 15 minutes. Slides were
incubated with permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS) then blocking buffer
(10% FBS in PBS). Anti-RNH1 (Prestige Antibodies® Sigma, HPA039223) was added
overnight at 1:500, followed by anti-rabbit secondary, ABC amplification and DAB

and coverslips applied with aqueous mounting agent and slides imaged using Zeiss axioscan
Z1. Images were analysed using Zen Lite software (Zeiss).
Sequence conservation analysis
Human RNH1 protein sequence was used as a query to perform Blastp with human refseq
proteins. From Blast output, selected protein sequences (excluding the isoforms and model
refseq proteins) were aligned using MAFFT multiple sequence aligner (Katoh and Standley,
2013). Sequence conservation analysis was performed on IQ-Tree webserver
(http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at/) using ultrafast bootstrap analysis with 1,000 number of
bootstrap alignments (Katoh and Standley, 2013) Circular tree was visualized using
Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) (Letunic and Bork, 2019). For structural alignment of
protein domains, the domain information of selected proteins were taken from Uniprot and
represented using Illustrator for Biological Sequences (IBS) tool (Liu et al., 2015) Sequences
