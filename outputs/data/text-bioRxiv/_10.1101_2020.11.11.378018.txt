Abstract
Since the first report of a new pneumonia disease in December 2019 (Wuhan, China) up to now
WHO reported more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than one million losses, globally.
The causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide resulting in a pandemic
of unprecedented magnitude. To date, no clinically safe drug or vaccine is available and the
development of molecules to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections is imminent. A well-known strategy
to identify molecules with inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is the repurposing of
clinically developed drugs, e.g., anti-parasitic drugs. The results described in this study demonstrate
the inhibitory potential of quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro).
Quinacrine and suramin molecules present a competitive and non-competitive mode of inhibition,
respectively, with IC50 and KD values in low µM range. Using docking and molecular dynamics
simulations we identified a possible binding mode and the amino acids involved in these
interactions. Our results suggested that suramin in combination with quinacrine showed promising
synergistic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The identification of effective, synergistic drug
combinations could lead to the design of better treatments for the COVID-19 disease. Drug
repositioning offers hope to the SARS-CoV-2 control.

Running title: In vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by suramin and quinacrine.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, 3CLpro, main protease, repurposing approved drugs,
suramin, quinacrine, inhibition type, substrate-binding site.

1. Introduction
December 2019, local health authorities reported an increasing number of pneumonia cases
spreading rapidly across the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province in China. The causative agent of this
disease was identified as SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Lu et al., 2020) and although most cases
are asymptomatic or only evidence mild symptoms with good recovery rates; a small percentage of the
infected patients develop more severe manifestations, such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure,
multiple organ failures and multiple cases resulting in death (Huang et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has
spread worldwide, leading to a coronavirus pandemic of unprecedented magnitude and the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an international public
health emergency (Lai et al., 2020). Globally, more than 50 million confirmed cases resulted in over 1.2
million victims as reported by the WHO on 11th of November 2020 (World Health Organization,
2020). This staggering number is a major challenge to precarious healthcare systems, especially, in
developing countries. Under these circumstances, the identification and development of safe and
effective SARS-CoV-2 drugs is of high priority.
Coronoviridae forms the largest family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and is
classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ) (Nga et al., 2011). SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 are β-coronaviruses (de Wit et al., 2020).
Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed a higher identity to bat SARS-like coronavirus
(89.1% nucleotide similarity) (Wu et al., 2020).
The genomic RNA of coronaviruses is ~30,000 nucleotides in length and contains at least six open
reading frames (ORFs) (Hussain et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2020) The first ORF (ORF 1a/b), about twothirds of the genome length, directly translates two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, so named because
there is an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b. These polyproteins are processed by a main
protease, Mpro (also known as 3C-like protease - 3CLpro) and, by viral papain-like proteases into 16
nonstructural proteins (NSPs). These NSPs are involved in the generation of subgenomic RNAs that
encode four main structural proteins (envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N)

proteins) and other accessory proteins (Ramajayam et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2013). Therefore, these
proteases, especially 3CLpro, play vital roles in the replication process of coronaviruses.
3CLpro is a cysteine protease with a three-domain (domains I to III) organization and with a
chymotrypsin like fold (Anand et al., 2002). Active 3CLpro consists of a homodimer containing two
protomers and the coronavirus 3CLpro features a noncanonical Cys-His dyad located in the cleft between
domains I and II (Anand et al., 2002; Anand et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003).
The functional importance of 3CLpro in the viral life cycle combined with the absence of closely
related homologues in humans, indicating that this protease is an attractive target for the development of
antiviral drugs (Pillaiyar et al., 2016). So far, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines available to
combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and the bureaucratic process to approve new drugs is a very time
consuming and costly process. Thus, repurposing of existing drug molecules could be a rapid alternative
to combat the virus infection. The well described anti-parasitic drugs like chloroquine, quinacrine and
suramin revealed anti-viral effects against SARS-Cov-2 in cell cultures (Liu et al., 2020; da Silva et al.,
2020; Duan et al., 2020; Roldan et al., 2020; Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020). These three compounds
have been used as antiprotozoal drugs, being that chloroquine and quinacrine are used against malaria
(Hoekenga, 1955; Joy, 1999) and suramin against sleeping sickness, which is caused by trypanosomes
(Steverding, 2010).
In the present study, we tested the inhibitory potentials of chloroquine, quinacrine and suramin
against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Quinacrine and suramin presented IC50 values < 10 µM and KD values in
a low µM range; however, chloroquine did not affect the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity. Further
experiments identified quinacrine and suramin as competitive and non-competitive inhibitor,
respectively. A 1:1 combination of quinacrine and suramin decreased the IC50 value to < 500 nM. Our
results indicate that quinacrine and suramin are interesting drug candidates to combat SARS-Cov-2
infections and molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation inferred the amino acid residues
responsible for the interaction between the 3C-like protease and the molecules.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Cloning, expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
The codon optimized cDNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Uniprot entry: P0DTD1) was
synthesized and implemented in the ampicillin resistant vector pGEX-6P-3 (BioCat GmbH,
Heidelberg, Germany). The construct contains an N-terminal GST-tag and a PreScission protease
cleavage site (LEFLFQGP).
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro-pGEX-6P-3 vectors were transformed into E. coli Lemo21 (DE3) (New
England BioLabs, USA) competent cells and has grown overnight at 37 ºC in LB-medium. This
pre-culture was added to fresh LB-medium (Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol) and grew at 37 ºC
until the cells reached an OD600 of 0.6. Gene expression was induced with final concentration of
0.5 mM IPTG (1 mM Rhamnose was added) and incubated for 3h, at 37 ºC and 120 rpm.
Subsequently, the culture was harvested by centrifugation (4,000 rpm) at 5 °C for 20 min (Sorvall
RC-5B Plus Superspeed Centrifuge, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA; GSA rotor). The supernatant
was discarded and the cells containing the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro_GST was
resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl (lysis buffer) and stored at -20 °C for
subsequent purification.
For purification, the cell-suspension was incubated on ice for 1 h with addition of lysozyme,
subsequently it was lysed by sonication in four pulses of 30 s each with amplitude of 30%
interspersed by intervals of 10 s. The crude cell extract obtained was centrifuged (7,000 rpm for 90
min at 6 °C). The supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro_GST was loaded onto a GSHSepharose matrix which was previously extensively washed with the lysis buffer and was
extensively washed with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with the same buffer plus addition
of 10 mM GSH. The eluted fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against PreScission protease
cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA). PreScission
protease was used to cleave the GST-tag from the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro_GST fused protein. For
100 µg target protein concentration, 10 µg PreScission protease was added and the sample was

incubated for 36 h at 4 °C. Separation of the target protein, the GST-tag and the PreScission protease
was achieved using GSH-Sepharose. Further, to remove aggregated fraction, size exclusion
chromatography was used (Superdex 200 10/300 GL GE Healthcare, USA), the column was
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Sample purity after each purification
step was assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The corresponding protein fraction was concentrated
up to 2 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C.

2.2 Activity assay of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity assay was performed as described earlier using a fluorogenic
substrate DABCYL-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKME-EDANS (Bachem, Switzerland) in a buffer
containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.2, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM TCEP (Zhang et al., 2020a;
Zhang et al., 2020b; Ma et al., 2020). The reaction mixture was pipetted in a Corning 96-Well plate
(Sigma Aldrich) consisting of 0.5 µM protein and the assay was initiated with the addition of the
substrate at a final concentration of 50 µM. The fluorescence intensities were measured at 60 s
intervals over 30 minutes using an Infinite 200 PRO plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).
The temperature was set to 37 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 nm and 460
nm, respectively. For KM and Vmax measurements, the procedure was followed as described
previously (Ma et al., 2020). A substrate concentration from 0 to 200 µM was applied. The initial
velocity of the proteolytic activity was calculated by linear regression for the first 15 minutes of the
kinetic progress curves. The initial velocity was plotted against the substrate concentration with the
classic Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism5 software and Kcat was obtained using
the equation (1):
Kcat = Vmax/[E]

(1)

while Vmax is the experimental determined maximal velocity and [E] is the enzyme
concentration in the experiment (Berg et al., 2002). All measurements were performed in triplicate
and data are presented as mean ± SD.

2.3 Inhibition assay of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity by chloroquine, quinacrine and suramin was
investigated using the activity assay described above. 10 µM of the compounds was used for a
preliminary screening test. For the final inhibition assays 0.5 µM of the protein was incubated with
0-100 µM suramin and 0-150 µM quinacrine, chloroquine did not show a satisfactory inhibitory
effect, therefore it was excluded from the studies. The mixtures were incubated for 30 minutes at
RT. When the substrate with a final concentration of 50 µM was added to the mixture, the
fluorescence intensities were measured at 60 s intervals over 30 minutes using an Infinite 200 PRO
plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The temperature was set to 37 °C. The excitation
and emission wavelengths were 360 nm and 460 nm, respectively. Inhibition assays were performed
as triplicates.
For the quinacrine and suramin combination test, a 1:1 stock solution of the molecules was
prepared and 0.5 µM of the protein was incubated with 0-75 µM of the combined molecules
(quinacrine and suramin).
The IC50 value was calculated by plotting the initial velocity against various concentrations of
the combined molecules using a dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism5 software. All
measurements were performed in triplicate and data are presented as mean ± SD.

2.4 Determination of inhibition mode and inhibitory constant
The mode of inhibition was determined using different final concentrations of the inhibitors and
substrate. Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro at 0.5 µM was incubated with the inhibitor at different
concentrations for 30 minutes at RT. Subsequently, the reaction was initiated by the addition of the
corresponding concentration series of the substrate. The data analysis was performed using a
Lineweaver-Burk plot, therefore the reciprocal of velocity (1/V) vs. the reciprocal of the substrate
concentration (1/[S]) was compared (Motulsky and Christopoulos, 2004; Roy et al., 2017). All

measurements were performed in triplicate and data are presented as mean ± SD. The inhibitory
constant (Ki) was obtained using equation (2):
IC50/(([S]/KM)+1)

(2)

while IC50 and KM were determined as described before and [S] is the concentration of substrate
used in the experiments (Wu et al., 2014).

2.5 Determination of dissociation constant using fluorescence spectroscopy
The intrinsic Trp fluorescence of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was measured under the influence of
quinacrine and suramin, based on this experiment the dissociation constant between the protein and
the ligands could be determined (Coronado et al., 2018). Briefly, protein sample was in 25 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl with a final concentration of 10 μM/50 µl. The protein solution
within the cuvette (1 cm path length) was titrated stepwise with a molecule stock solution 0-48 µM
of quinacrine or suramin (to avoid protein dilution the molecule stock solution was treated with the
same protein concentration - 10 μM protein + 500 µM molecule stock). A measurement was
conducted following each titration. The quenching of the protease fluorescence, ΔF (Fmax-F), at 330
nm of each titration point was used for fitting a saturation binding curve using a nonlinear leastsquares fit procedure which has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Johnson and Frasier, 1985)
based on equation (3) (Shaikh et al., 2007):
Y = Bmax[Q] / KD + [Q]

(3)

where, [Q] is the ligand concentration in solution, acting as a quencher, y is the specific binding
derived by measuring fluorescence intensity, Bmax is the maximum amount of the protease-ligand
complex at saturation of the ligand and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The percentage
of bound protease, i.e. y, derived from the fluorescence intensity maximum, is plotted against the
ligand concentration. Additionally, the data were fitted with a modified Hill equation obtaining the
following relation (4) (Wang et al., 2015; Ahumada et al., 2017):

Log (F-Fmin)/(F) = m log KD + n log [Q] (4)
where, Fmin is the minimal fluorescence intensity in the presence of the ligand, K D is the
equilibrium constant for the protein-ligand complex. The “binding constant” K is defined as the
reciprocal of KD.

2.6 Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
CD measurements were carried out with a Jasco J-1100 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Germany).
Far-UV spectra were measured in 190 to 260 nm using a protein concentration of four µM in 20
mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 pH 7.5. Cells of one mm path length were used for the measurements; 15
repeat scans were obtained for each sample and five scans were conducted to establish the respective
baselines. The averaged baseline spectrum was subtracted from the averaged sample spectrum. The
results are presented as molar ellipticity [], according to the equation (5):
[θ]λ = θ/(c*0.001*l*n)

(5)

where  is the ellipticity measured at the wavelength  (deg), c is the protein concentration
(mol/L), 0.001 the cell path length (cm) and n the number of amino acids. The results were analyzed
and the secondary structure content was determined using the CDpro software package (Sreerama
and Woody, 2000).

2.7 Systems information, molecular docking and ligand parameterization
The 3D model of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was obtained from the PDB database (PDB entry:
6M2Q). The protonation state of the amino acid side chain was set to pH 7.4 using web-server H++
(Gordon et al., 2005), placed in a water box, neutralized and followed by a 200 ns molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation and the representative structure was obtained by clustering analysis.
Molecular docking was used to select the best pose for the ligand-protein interaction using

Autodock Vina program (Trott and Olson, 2010). A grid box was defined for docking the molecule
(quinacrine) near the active site and for docking in an allosteric site (suramin). These calculations
were performed with the scoring function of the program that ranked several poses for each ligand.
The best pose of each ligand was chosen to prepare the 3CLpro-quinacrine and -suramin complexes.
Ligands were parameterized using Gaussian 16 (Frisch et al., 2016) at the level of theory HF/631G* to optimize their geometry and calculate their electrostatic potentials. Restrained electrostatic
potential (RESP) charges were determined using antechamber (Wang et al., 2006), while the general
amber force field (GAFF) (Wang et al., 2004) was used for the missing parameters.

2.8 Simulation setup
All the molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the Amber18 (Case et al., 2018)
software package and the FF19SB (Tian et al., 2020) force field was used to describe the protein
atoms interactions, while GAFF and RESP charges describe the quinacrine and suramin molecules.
The systems were solvated in an octahedral box of TIP3P water molecules with at least 10 Å
distance from any solvent atoms between the solute's in each direction and the system was
neutralized when necessary. Initially, energy minimization was performed in two steps to remove
poor contacts from the initial structures. First, the protein/complex was constrained (force constant
of 50.0 kcal/mol.Å2) and minimized using 5,000 steepest descent steps followed by 5,000 conjugate
gradient steps and by a 10,000 steps unconstrained energy minimization round. The system was
slowly heated from 0 to 298 K for 500 ps under constant atom number, volume and temperature
(NVT) ensemble, while the protein was restrained with a force constant of 25 kcal/mol.Å2. After
the heating process, the equilibrium stage was performed using constant atoms number, pressure
and temperature (NpT) ensemble for 5 ns. Finally, the simulation run was performed for 200 ns
(single protein) and 300 ns (complexes) without any restraints and under NVT ensemble and, the
constant temperature and pressure (1 atm) were controlled by Langevin coupling. Long-range
electrostatic interaction was calculated by the particle-mesh Ewald method (PME) (Darden et al.,

1993) with 8 Å cutoff. The Shake constraints were applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms
to allow a 2-fs dynamics time step.

2.9

Molecular dynamics analysis
The CPPTRAJ9⁠ program of AmberTools19 (Case et al., 2005) was used to analyze the MD

simulations. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the radius of gyration (Rg) of Cα were
calculated to determine the system quality and stability and to determine the equilibration and
convergence of the systems. Protein flexibility was calculated by the root mean square fluctuation
(RMSF) for all Cα atoms, residue-by-residue over the equilibrated trajectories.
Clustering analysis was performed with the k-means method ranging from 2 to 6 and to access
the quality of clustering the DBI values and silhouette analyses was used.
The interaction energy was calculated using the generalized Born (GB)-Neck2 (Nguyen et al.,
2013) implicit solvent model (igb = 8). Molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area
(MM/GBSA) energy was computed between the protein and the ligand in a stable regime
comprising the last 50 ns of the MD simulation, stripping all the solvent and ions. The web version
of POCASA 1.1 was used to determine the volume of the active site pocket after MD simulations
(Yu et al., 2010).

2.10 Statistical analysis
The significance of the inhibition assays and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments were
evaluated by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test.
Differences were considered significant when a P value was less than 0.05 (Zhang et al., 1999) All
statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software version 5 (San Diego, CA,
USA).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro_GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli Lemo21 (DE3) cells and
purified using a GSH-Sepharose column (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The relevant protein fractions
were concentrated and prepared for PreScission protease cleavage to remove the GST-tag. The SDS
gel (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C) indicate the cleavage efficiency and the purity of 3CLpro.
The pure protein was concentrated and applied onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion
chromatography (GE Healthcare) to remove aggregated protein species (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). CD spectroscopy of 3CLpro indicated that the protein is correctly folded after purification
process and GST-cleavage. Deconvolution of the CD data using the software CDpro (Sreerama and
Woody, 2000) showed that the protein secondary structure contains around 28% α-helices and 23%
β-strands. Which is in good agreements with data from the crystal structure (PDB entry: 6M2Q)
which contain 25% α-helices and 28% β-strands (Supplementary Fig. S1E).

3.2 Activity assay of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity was investigated using an assay procedure described earlier
(Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b; Ma et al., 2020) and DABCYL-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKMEEDANS (Bachem, Switzerland) was used as substrate. Activity assays were performed to obtain
the kinetic key values Vmax, KM and Kcat. A standard curve was generated converting the relative
fluorescence unit (RFU) to the amount of cleaved substrate (µM) (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In
the next step, enzymatic activity of the protease was characterized by measuring Vmax and KM
values; 0.5 µM of the protease was mixed with various concentrations of the substrate (0-200 µM).
The initial velocity was measured and plotted against the substrate concentration. Curve fitting with
Michaelis-Menten equation resulted in the best fitting values of KM and Vmax as 25.47 ± 3.43 µM
and 47.52 ± 2.91 µM/s, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The calculated Kcat/KM was

(Zhang et al., 2020a; Ma et al., 2020).

3.3 Inhibition assay of chloroquine, quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
A primary inhibition test of the three antiparasitic compounds chloroquine, quinacrine and
suramin (10 µM) was performed against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro to screen the best inhibitor against
the virus protease (Fig. 1).

suramin inhibit the virus protease activity by more than 60%. Contrary, chloroquine shows not relevant inhibition, just about 10%.
The blue box shows the molecular structures of (A) Chloroquine, (B) Quinacrine and (C) Suramin.

The primary inhibition tests showed a strong effect of quinacrine and suramin against SARSCoV-2 3CLpro activity. In contrast, chloroquine has a weak effect on 3CLpro proteolytic activity.
Suramin and quinacrine possess an anti-viral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (da Silva et
al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020; Roldan et al., 2020; Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020), however, the target
protein of both molecules in the viral replication process was not identified. Based on the primary
inhibition results, quinacrine and suramin were further investigated regarding their inhibitory
potential, and our results demonstrate that suramin and quinacrine have an inhibitory effect against
the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 2 and 3, respectively).

the 3CLpro (Fig. 2C), it means that the molecule interacts directly with amino acid residues located

The potency of suramin in inhibiting 3CLpro was calculated and demonstrated an IC50 value of

The IC50 values of both molecules are in a concentration range with other repurposed drug
molecules, which also demonstrate inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, for example;
boceprevir has an IC50 value of 4.14 µM (Ma et al., 2020), menadione presents IC50 value of 7.9
µM (He et al., 2020) and disulfiram has an IC50 of 9.35 µM (Jin et al., 2020).

3.4 Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with suramin and quinacrine using fluorescence
spectroscopy
To confirm the viability of the assay, fluorescence spectra from the intrinsic tryptophan (Trp)
of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with the inhibitor molecules were investigated. The fluorescence
changes of Trp can reflect environmental variation of the protein and the decreased Trp emission
intensity confirmed the complex formation between the protease and the inhibitory molecules.
Based on the quenching of the protease fluorescence of each titration point, the dissociation constant
(KD) could be determined for each molecule (suramin and quinacrine) (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Table 2 describe the KD value of the suramin interaction with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (4.5 ± 1.2
µM) with slight increase for quinacrine (6.0 ± 1.8 µM). Interestingly, the protein interaction with
suramin or quinacrine induce a different type of excitation shift of the protein tryptophans. Suramin
interaction induces a conformational change in the protein structure, which was demonstrated by a
red edge excitation shift (REES) of about 30 nm (330 to 360 nm) (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
REES is defined through increasing interactions between the fluorophore (Trp) and the surrounding
solvent in the ground and excited state (Catici et al., 2016). On the contrary, the quinacrine
interaction induced a blue edge excitation shift (BEES) of around 10 nm (330 to 320 nm)
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). Through BEES, the environment hydrophobicity of the Trp residue
increases significantly (Möller and Denicola, 2002).

3.5 Docking and molecular dynamic simulations of suramin and quinacrine with SARS-CoV2 3CLpro structure
The atomic coordinates from SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB entry: 6M2Q) was used as initial
model. Cluster analysis of the MD simulations demonstrated that cluster #0 showed the best results
with representativeness of over 86.1% of the whole simulation time and the selected structure
appeared during the simulation around 169 ns (Supplementary Fig. S5). SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is a
homodimer with the catalytical dyad His41 and Cys145 (Zhang et al., 2020a). Dimerization of the
protease is necessary for catalytic activity; the interaction of each protomer N-terminal Ser1 with
Glu166 of the other protomer stabilizes the shape of the S1 pocket, which is important for the
binding of the substrate (Anand et al., 2002). Chen et al. 2006 suggested that only one protomer of
the SARS-CoV 3CLpro dimer is active (Chen et al., 2006). Interestingly, after the initial MD
simulations of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro dimer (Supplementary Fig. S6), one protomer active site

collapsed and, the volume of the pocket decreased by around twofold, from 261 to 142 Å3 compared
to the active site of the other protomer. The main difference observed between the two protomers
succeeding the MD simulation was the interaction between the C-terminal Gln306 and Ile152 of
the same protomer. A hydrogen bond was observed between NE2 of Gln306 and the backbone
oxygen of Ile152 (Supplementary Fig. S7). We assume that this interaction in addition to the
already described (Glu166 with Ser1) stabilizes the active site. To conceive the molecular binding
modes of the inhibitory molecules, theoretical investigations through docking and molecular
dynamics simulations were carried out. The interactions between SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex
with quinacrine or suramin were analyzed to predict their binding mode. Quinacrine was docked in
both protease active sites (as competitive inhibitor) and suramin (as non-competitive inhibitor) in a
region with strong positive charges on the protein surface, as suramin is a highly negatively charged
molecule (Burch and Ashburn, 1951). Subsequent MD simulations demonstrated a stable system
for a period of 300 ns (Supplementary Fig. S8 and S9). The binding assessment of the ligands to
the protease was observed using a residue-wise decomposition of the binding energy received from
the MD simulations. Table 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the 3CLpro amino acid residues contribution to
the binding energy in the active site that interact with quinacrine. The interactions between
quinacrine and the protease are stabilized by two hydrogen bonds (H-bond), which are mediated by
donor and acceptor atoms of Met165 and Gln189 (Table 4). His41, Met49, Val186, Arg188 and
Gln194 interact with quinacrine by hydrophobic interactions (Table 3 and Fig. 4).

As a competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, quinacrine interacts through hydrophobic
interaction with His41 of the protease catalytic dyad, blocking the entrance to the active site.

An important task is the suitability of the inhibitor to the binding areas so that covalent inhibition
occurs (Pettinger et al., 2017). Therefore, the nucleophilicity of the amino acid residues in the target
and electrophilic groups in the drug need to be considered (Way, 2000). The relative nucleophilicity
of the amino acid residues in their neutral states are given in the order of Cys (1) > His (10−2) > Met
(10−3) > Lys, Ser (10−5) > Thr and Tyr (10–6) (Way, 2000; Pettinger et al., 2017). This is one of the
reasons why many of the covalent modifiers in drugs are designed to target the thiol group of
cysteine (Gan et al., 2009; Leproult et al., 2011). Quinacrine interact directly with nucleophilic
residues in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (e.g. His41 and Met165) which make them highly
attractive for covalent interactions. Contrary, suramin interact with Lys and Tyr residues that can
also form covalent bonds (Tang et al., 2020), but in a less probability compared with Cys, His and
Met.
To study in more detail the plasticity of the virus protease in complex with quinacrine and
suramin the consequences on the ligand binding areas, the substrate-binding sites (S1, S1´, S2, S3)
and the oxyanion hole after MD simulation of the complexes were analysed. Amino acid residues
forming the substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and their subsites were described
previously (Supplementary Table S1) (Chen et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2020). Fig. 6 describe the
changes occurred on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro substrate-binding site caused by the interaction of the
inhibitors. MD simulations revealed possible mode of interaction of quinacrine with SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro. Thereby, His41, one amino acid residue of the catalytic dyad, interact with quinacrine, this
interaction is responsible to block partially the S1` and S3 sites occupying completely the S2 subsite
(Fig. 6). Four residues of the protease S2 subsite interact directly with quinacrine via hydrophobic
interactions (His41, Met49, Asp187 and Arg188) and two residues of the S3 subsite form H-bonds
with the inhibitor molecule (Met165 and Gln189). In the case of suramin, no single amino acid
residue of the S1, S1`, S2 and S3 subsites are in interaction with the ligand, which agrees with the
results of the activity assay that describe suramin as non-competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro.

occupied area by the molecules and the conformational changes induced by its binding. Substrate-binding subsites highlighted as

Suramin binds allosterically and the ligand interaction induces conformational changes in the
catalytic site (most observable for subsites S1` and S2), thus preventing the entry and the turnover
of the substrate (Fig. 7). Additionally, the volume of the active site pocket decreased considerably
after suramin binding, even whether the molecule was docking just in protomer 1, changing the
volume of the pocket from 261 to 90 Å3 (Protomer 1) and to 120 (Protomer 2) (Fig. 7C to E).

3.6 Suramin and quinacrine act cooperatively to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
Suramin and quinacrine, as described previously, bind in different regions of SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro.To conjecture about the effect of both molecules simultaneously, we performed a combined
inhibitory assay, whither both molecules were mixed (1:1) and tested against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
(Fig. 8).

activity and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro under quinacrine and suramin influence.

The inhibition assay was performed with a solution containing both ligands (suramin and

increased inhibition capacity of the drugs (Table 5 and supplementary Fig. S11). When compared
with the single molecules, the combination enhances the inhibitory capacity of the studied drugs
for approx. 10 times. Which could be observed by the determined IC50 values. We assume that the
conformational changes after suramin interaction with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro induce a structural

change in both active sites in the dimer, which could make them more accessible for the interaction
with quinacrine (Fig. 7).

4. Conclusions
In summary, the cooperative inhibition of quinacrine and suramin could lead to a possible
alternative to combat COVID-19 infections. Repurposing of clinically developed drugs is a
common procedure to combat fast evolving pathogens. Similar studies addressed the use of
established drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. Boceprevir, Menadione and Disulfiram) (Ma et al.,
2020; He et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020). (Table 5). The 1:1 combination of quinacrine and suramin
possess an effective anti-3CLpro activity, demonstrating the potential of repurposing drugs to stop
the replication process of SARS-CoV-2.
