Abstract

31
32

Background: As long as there is no vaccine available, having access to inhibitors of SARS-

33

CoV-2 will be of utmost importance. Antivirals against coronaviruses do not exist, hence global

34

drug re-purposing efforts have been carried out to identify agents that may provide clinical

35

benefit to patients with COVID-19. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been reported to have

36

potential activity against animal coronaviruses.

37
38

Methods: Using cell-based phenotypic assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of itraconazole and

39

17-OH itraconazole was assessed against clinical isolates from a German and Belgian patient

40

infected with SARS-CoV-2.

41
42

Results: Itraconazole demonstrated antiviral activity in human Caco-2 cells (EC50 = 2.3 µM;

43

MTT assay). Similarly, its primary metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole, showed inhibition of SARS-

44

CoV-2 activity (EC50 = 3.6 µM). Remdesivir inhibited viral replication with an EC50 = 0.4 µM.

45

Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole resulted in a viral yield reduction in vitro of approximately

46

2-log10 and approximately 1-log10, as measured in both Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells,

47

respectively. The viral yield reduction brought about by remdesivir or GS-441524 (parent

48

nucleoside of the antiviral prodrug remdesivir; positive control) was more pronounced, with an

49

approximately 3 log10 drop and >4 log10 drop in Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells,

50

respectively.

51
52

Discussion: Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole exert in vitro low micromolar activity against

53

SARS-CoV-2. Despite the in vitro antiviral activity, itraconazole did not result in a beneficial

54

effect in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a clinical study (EudraCT Number: 2020-001243-15).

Introduction

56
57

The rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-

58

CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic.1,2 SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-

59

coronavirus, which are enveloped viruses containing single-strand, positive-sense RNA.3 Since

60

COVID-19 emerged in humans in late December 2019,4 aside from a significant economic loss,

61

more than a million death have been reported worldwide, driving urgently the need to identify

62

potential vaccines and therapies.

63
64

Given that therapeutic options for antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 remain limited, research

65

has initially focused on re-purposing available drugs that have demonstrated antiviral activity

66

against coronaviruses. As part of such an initiative, itraconazole was identified as a potential

67

candidate. Itraconazole has been described previously to have activity in an in vitro screen

68

using a luciferase reporter-expressing recombinant murine betacoronavirus,5 as well as against

69

a feline alphacoronavirus that causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).6 Furthermore, in vitro

70

and in vivo activity has been described against other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A

71

and human rhinovirus.7,8

72
73

Itraconazole is a member of the triazole group of broad-spectrum antifungals,9 with a well-

74

established efficacy and safety profile.8–12 The primary mechanism of its antifungal action is the

75

inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, by acting on the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP).13–16

76

Since ergosterol is closely related to cholesterol, it has been suggested that also in mammalian

77

cells, itraconazole acts as a cholesterol trafficking inhibitor resulting in disruption of the

78

cholesterol-enriched membranes and thus inhibition of virus replication.6,8,17 However, a role in

79

interferon priming has also been suggested as a contributing factor to the antiviral activity.18

In an attempt to identify therapeutic options for treating COVID-19 patients, the in vitro antiviral

82

activities of itraconazole, and its metabolite 17-OH itraconazole were investigated in Caco-2 and

83

VeroE6-eGFP cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, isolated from COVID-19 patients.

Methods

86
87

Cell culture

88

Caco-2 cells (human colon carcinoma cell line; obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von

89

Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured in Minimal Essential

90

Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with penicillin (100 IU/mL)

91

and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. VeroE6-eGFP (African green

92

monkey kidney cell line; provided by Dr. K. Andries J&JPRD; Beerse, Belgium) were cultured in

93

Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.075% sodium

94

bicarbonate, penicillin and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All cell

95

culture reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Hamburg, Germany).

96
97

SARS-CoV-2 Preparation

98

SARS-CoV-2-FFM1 (strain hCoV-19/Germany/FrankfurtFFM1/2020) was isolated from a

99

German human-case sample and cultured in Caco-2 cells, as previously described.1,19

100

SARS-CoV-2-Germany stocks were passaged twice in Caco-2 cells prior to storage (–80°C).

101

SARS-CoV-2-Belgium (strain BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020) was recovered from a

102

nasopharyngeal swab taken from a patient returning from Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 Belgium

103

stocks were passaged six times in VeroE6-eGFP cells prior to storage (-80°C).

104

Assessment of Antiviral Activity

105

Itraconazole and its metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole, and remdesivir were synthesized at

106

Johnson and Johnson. GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, used in studies at KU

107

Leuven was obtained from MedChemExpress (NJ, USA). Antiviral activity was assessed by

108

inhibition of virus-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE) as described previously.20 In brief,

109

confluent layers of Caco-2 cells cultured for 72 hours on 96 multi-well plates (50,000 cells/well)

110

were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 FFM1 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. The virus was

111

added together with the compound under investigation and incubated in MEM supplemented

112

with 1% FBS. Itraconazole diluted in MEM without FBS in 4-fold dilutions was added to a

113

concentration range of 0.01 μM to 50 μM; 17-OH itraconazole diluted in MEM without FBS was

114

added in 4-fold dilutions to a concentration range of 0.02 μM to 100 μM and remdesivir diluted in

115

MEM without FBS in 4-fold dilutions was added to a concentration range of 0.02 μM to 100 μM.

116

Cells were incubated for 48 hours; the CPE was then visually scored by two independent

117

laboratory technicians. In addition, CPE was also assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-

118

2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, performed according to the manufacturer’s

119

instructions. Optical densities were measured at 560/620 nm in a Multiskan Reader (MCC/340

120

Labsystems). Two series of three independent experiments (or one series of three experiments

121

for 17OH-itraconazole), each containing three replicates, were performed. Data were analyzed

122

by four-parameter curve-fitting from a dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism (version

123

7.00) to calculate the EC50 (concentration of the compound that inhibited 50% of the infection)

124

based on visual CPE scoring or the MTT assay.

125
126

Assessment of Cell Viability

127

Cell viability in Caco-2 cells was measured following administration of each of the compounds or

128

metabolites under investigation over the range of concentrations in the absence of virus using

129

the Rotitest Vital (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) test according to manufacturer’s instructions, as

130

previously described.21 All assays were performed three times independently in triplicate, this

131

was performed twice (once for 17OH-itraconazole). Data were analyzed by four-parameter

132

curve-fitting from a dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism (version 7.00) to calculate the

133

CC50 (cytotoxic concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50%).

Antiviral activity was assessed by inhibition of viral yield in Caco-2 cells. Confluent layers of

137

Caco-2 cells cultured for 72 hours on 96 multi-well plates (50,000 cells/well) were challenged with

138

SARS-CoV-2-FFM1 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. The virus was added together with the

140

diluted in MEM without FBS was added in 4-fold dilutions to a concentration range of 0.01 μM to

141

50 μM; 17-OH itraconazole diluted in MEM without FBS was added in 4-fold dilutions to a

142

concentration range of 0.02 μM to 100 μM and remdesivir diluted in MEM without FBS was added

143

in 4-fold dilutions to a concentration range of 0.02 μM to 100 μM. Two series of three independent

144

experiments, each containing two replicates, were performed.

145
146

SARS-CoV-2 RNA from cell culture supernatant samples was isolated using AVL buffer and the

147

QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance-based

148

quantification of the RNA yield was performed using the Genesys 10S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer

149

(Thermo Scientific). RNA was subjected to OneStep qRT-PCR analysis using the Luna Universal

150

One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) and a CFX96 Real-Time System, C1000 Touch

151

Thermal Cycler (BioRad). Primers were adapted from the WHO protocol targeting the open

152

reading frame for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): RdRP_SARSr-F2 (GTG ARA TGG

153

TCA TGT GTG GCG G) and RdRP_SARSr-R1 (CAR ATG TTA AAS ACA CTA TTA GCA TA)

using 0.4 µM per reaction. Standard curves were created using plasmid DNA (pEX-A128-RdRP)

155

harboring the corresponding amplicon regions for RdRP target sequence according to GenBank

156

Accession number NC_045512.

157
158

Antiviral activity was also assessed by reduction of viral yield in VeroE6-eGFP cells. VeroE6-

In Vitro Antiviral Activity in Caco-2 cells

176

Independent experiments with triplicate measurements were performed with itraconazole (n=6),

177

17-OH itraconazole (n=3) and remdesivir (n=6). In Caco-2 cells, itraconazole resulted in a dose-

178

dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-FFM1 measured by visual scoring of inhibition of CPE with

179

an EC50 = 1.5 μM (Figure 1). Similar findings were obtained using the MTT assay (EC50 = 2.3

180

μM). The 17-OH itraconazole metabolite reduced SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE with an EC50 visual

181

of 1.2 μM and EC50 MTT = 3.6 μM. The positive control, remdesivir, resulted in EC50 values of 0.3

182

and 0.4 µM in the CPE and MTT assays in Caco-2 cells, respectively.

183
184

Minimal cytotoxicity was seen in Caco-2 cells with both itraconazole (CC50 >50 μM) and 17-OH

185

itraconazole (CC50 >100 μM) (Figure 1). For remdesivir CC50 values >100 μM were observed in

186

Caco-2 cells.

In Vitro Viral RNA Yield Reduction

215

The in vitro effect of itraconazole and remdesivir (Caco-2 cells) orGS-441522 (VeroE6-eGFP

216

cells) on SARS-CoV-2 RNA yield reduction was assessed in Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP

217

cells. A concentration of 6.25 µM and 3.1 µM of itraconazole and its main metabolite 17-OH

218

itraconazole, respectively, resulted in an approximately 2-log10 reduction in viral RNA levels (as

219

a measure of the number of virus particles in the culture SN) in Caco-2 cells. This reduction was

220

observed at all higher doses, in the absence of toxicity. However, remdesivir proved more

221

potent (a reduction of ~3 log10 at 6.25 µM) (Figure 2).

Discussion

262

While a number of vaccines are in development, for the moment there are no antivirals for the

263

prevention of COVID-19 and only a limited number of antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19.22

264

Given the great unmet need to identify potential treatments for COVID-19, and the fact that a de

265

novo drug development project will take many years to bring a drug to patients, efforts have

266

been expedited into the in vitro screening of compounds already on the market, or in late-stage

267

development. In such an effort, itraconazole was identified, with single digit micromolar activity

268

in Caco-2 cells. Itraconazole was first approved (in the US) in 1992 as an oral treatment for a

269

number of fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients,

270

with a well-established safety profile.11

271
272

These experiments demonstrated that itraconazole inhibits in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication in

273

Caco-2 cells. The EC50 values for inhibition of virus-induced CPE formation is in the low

274

micromolar range and in that respect, is only around 5-fold higher than that of remdesivir. To

275

obtain further evidence for the antiviral potency of the drug(s), the effect on viral RNA yield in

276

culture was assessed in two cell lines. Itraconazole results in a marked inhibition of virus yield;

277

however, itraconazole was less potent than remdesivir. Our findings are in line with recent data

278

showing that itraconazole inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in

279

both Calu-3 and Vero E6 cell lines (with EC50s of 0.43 μM and 0.39 μM respectively).23 In

280

addition, in vitro studies have also demonstrated activity of itraconazole against murine

281

coronavirus (recombinant murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, EC50 = 7.9 µM)5 and type I

282

(but not type II) feline coronavirus (EC50 across three strains tested = 0.146–0.597 μM).6

283

Itraconazole has documented activity against a number of enteroviruses, including rhinovirus.8,15

284

Further, at a dose of 5.7 mg/kg, itraconazole resulted in improved mortality and a lower viral

285

load in mice that had been infected with human influenza (strain PR8M) compared with the

286

control group.7

287

As an antifungal agent, itraconazole inhibits fungal ergosterol biosynthesis, through inhibition of

288

a cytochrome P450 enzyme, lanosterol-14-alpha-demethylase.13–16 It is also thought to interfere

289

with cholesterol homeostasis and de novo synthesis in the host’s cells through inhibition of this

same enzyme, thereby influencing the virus/host cell interaction.17,24–26 The antiviral effect of

291

itraconazole may be, at least in part, based on such a mechanism. Itraconazole impairs

292

cholesterol trafficking and blocks late endosomal/lysosomal export of cholesterol to the plasma

293

membrane through NPC1 leading to cholesterol accumulation in sub-cellular

294

compartments.8,16,24–27 In turn, elevated cholesterol levels in the endosomal membrane impede

295

fusion of the viral lipid envelope and prevent viral genome transfer into the host cell cytosol.7,28 It

296

has been postulated that such changes in cellular cholesterol are linked with the host’s immune

297

response.29 Disruption of cholesterol biosynthesis has been shown to upregulate type I

298

interferons and thereby accelerate the virus-induced interferon-mediated host cell response.7,29

299

It has also been suggested that itraconazole may have antiviral effects through proteins other

300

than NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1).6 In enteroviruses, itraconazole has

301

been shown to inhibit viral RNA replication by oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which is

302

responsible for trafficking of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate between

303

membranes, thus also affecting the membranes of the replication complex.15,16 Since

304

coronaviruses result in the formation of intracellular viral replicative organelles within the

305

endoplasmic reticulum that drive the viral replication cycle,30–32 it is possible that inhibition of

306

OSBP may cause detrimental changes to replicative organelle membranes.15,16,32,33 Although it

307

remains to be confirmed how itraconazole may inhibit the replication cycle of coronaviruses, it is

308

conceivable that it acts through multiple mechanisms.7,17

309
310

As a lipophilic compound, itraconazole has high bioavailability and extensive distribution

311

throughout the lung, kidney, epidermis and brain.9 Itraconazole is predominantly metabolized by

312

the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system, forming many metabolites.34,35 The main

313

metabolite produced is 17-OH itraconazole, which also has considerable antifungal activity.34

314

Following administration of itraconazole 200mg bid, itraconazole and its 17-OH hydroxy-

315

metabolite have been shown to reach mean maximal plasma concentrations of 2282 and 3488

316

ng/mL (~ 3.2 μM and ~4.8 μM) and a Ctrough of 1855 and 3349 ng/ml (~2.6 μM and ~4.7 μM),

317

respectively, which is close to the EC50 for inhibition of virus-induced CPE. Both the parent drug

318

and metabolite have long half-lives (64 and 56 hours, respectively).11

319
320

In conclusion, itraconazole and its metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole show in vitro activity against

321

SARS-CoV-2. Based on these in vitro findings, a clinical study in hospitalized COVID-19

322

patients was initiated by UZ Leuven in March 2020.36 However, no efficacy of the drug was

323

observed in this particular study population; other studies in non-hospitalized patients were not

324

conducted.
