Summary

14

To understand the CD8+ T cell immunity related to viral protection and disease severity in COVID-19, we

15

evaluated the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome (3141 MHC-I binding peptides) to identify immunogenic T

16

cell epitopes, and determine the level of CD8+ T cell involvement using DNA-barcoded peptide-major

17

histocompatibility complex (pMHC) multimers. COVID-19 patients showed strong T cell responses, with

18

up to 25% of all CD8+ lymphocytes specific to SARS-CoV-2-derived immunodominant epitopes, derived

19

from ORF1 (open reading frame 1), ORF3, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein. A strong signature of T cell

20

activation was observed in COVID-19 patients, while no T cell activation was seen in the ‘non-exposed’

21

and ‘high exposure risk’ healthy donors. Interestingly, patients with severe disease displayed the largest

22

T cell populations with a strong activation profile. These results will have important implications for

23

understanding the T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how T cell immunity might influence

24

disease development.

Introduction

2

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 (severe

3

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has challenged public health at an unprecedented scale,

4

causing the death of more than one million people so far (World Health Organization). The T-cell of the

5

immune system is the main cell type responsible for the control and elimination of viral infections; CD8+

6

T cells are critical for the clearance of viral-infected cells, whereas CD4+ T cells are critical for supporting

7

both the CD8+ T cell response efficacy and the generation of specific antibodies. Characteristics from the

8

ongoing pandemic suggest that T cell recognition will be critical to mediate long-term protection against

9

SARS-CoV-2 (Cañete and Vinuesa, 2020), as the antibody-mediated response seems to decline in

10

convalescent patients in 3-month follow-up evaluation (Seow et al., 2020; Vabret, 2020). Furthermore,

11

studies of the closely related SARS-CoV infection shows persistent memory CD8+ T cell responses even

12

after 11 years in SARS recovered patients without B cell responses (Peng et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2011),

13

emphasizing the potential role of CD8+ memory T cells in long-term protection from coronaviruses.

14

Several recent studies have reported robust T cell immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Ni et al.,

15

2020; Peng et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020), and unexposed healthy individuals also showed

16

functional T cell reactivity restricted to SARS-CoV-2 (Le Bert et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Meckiff et

17

al., 2020; Nelde et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020). The T cell cross-reactivity is

18

hypothesized to derive from routine exposure to common cold coronaviruses (HCoV) (HCoV-OC43,

19

HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) that are widely circulated in the population with 90% of the

20

human population being seropositive for these viruses (Braun et al., 2020; Kissler et al., 2020), which

21

share sequence homology with the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Mateus et al., 2020; Stervbo et al., 2020).

22

SARS-CoV-2 infection might result in mild to severe disease (including death), but also a large number of

23

asymptomatic infections are described (Havers et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Oran and Topol, 2020).

The presence of pre-existing T cell immunity, represented by cross-reactive T cells, could have marked

2

implications for how individuals respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their biological role upon

3

encounter with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, and their contribution to disease protection

4

needs to be determined. Furthermore, in severe clinical disease, cytokine release syndrome is reported,

5

and might, in some cases, be dampened to immunosuppressive medication or anti-IL6 antibody-therapy

6

(Moore and June, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Such clinical characteristics point to a potential uncontrolled

7

immune response with the involvement of strong T cell activation.

8

T cells are activated by a specific interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide-antigen

9

presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of virus-infected cells.

10

Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity has been reported both in the context of COVID-19 infection

11

and pre-existing T cells, the exact antigens (minimal peptide epitope) of the viral genome associated

12

with this immunity in COVID-19-infected patients is not fully known. Using our large-scale T cell

13

detection technology based on DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC multimers (Bentzen et al., 2016), we have

14

mapped T cell recognition throughout the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome, and identified the exact

15

epitopes recognized by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we have evaluated the

16

phenotype characteristics of T cells recognizing these epitopes in COVID-19 patients and in healthy

17

donors.

Results

2

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell immunity is represented by strong immunodominant epitopes

3

To reveal the full spectrum of T cell immunity in COVID-19 infection, we used a complete SARS-CoV-2

4

genome sequence (Wu et al., 2020) to identify immunogenic minimal epitopes recognized by CD8+ T

5

cells. Using NetMHCpan 4.1 (Reynisson et al., 2020), we selected 2204 potential HLA binding peptides

6

(9–11 amino acids) for experimental evaluation. These peptides were predicted to bind one or more of

7

ten prevalent and functionally diverse MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules representing HLA-A (A01:01,

8

A02:01, A03:01, and A24:02), -B (B07:02, B08:01, B15:01), and -C (C06:02, C07:01, and C07:02) loci,

9

leading to a total 3141 peptide-MHC specificities for experimental evaluation (Figure 1A,

10

Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1A). T cell reactivity towards these peptides was

11

analyzed in 18 COVID-19-infected patients (Supplementary Table 2), with a mean HLA coverage of 3.1

12

and evaluation of an average of 972 peptides per patient (Supplementary Figure 1B) by our high-

13

throughput T cell detection technology using DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers (Bentzen

14

et al., 2016). Briefly, each pMHC complex is multimerized on a PE- (Phycoerythrin) or APC-

15

(Allophycocyanin) labeled dextran backbone and tagged with a unique DNA-barcode. DNA-barcoded

16

pMHC multimers are then pooled to generate an HLA matching patient-tailored pMHC multimer panel,

17

which is incubated with patient-derived PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and multimers

18

bound to CD8+ T cells are sorted and sequenced to identify T cell recognition towards the probed pMHC

19

complexes. For phenotype characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, we combined pMHC

20

multimer analysis with a 13-parameter antibody panel (Supplementary Table 3), and for comparative

21

evaluation, we furthermore included 39 T cell epitopes from common viruses; cytomegalovirus (CMV),

22

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and influenza (Flu) virus (CEF, Supplementary Table 4) (Figure 1B).

We found broad and strong SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19 patients,

2

contributing up to 27% of the total CD8+ T cells (Figure 1C). A few epitopes showed characteristics of

3

immunodominance, and raised T cell responses up to 25% of total CD8+ T cells against two overlapping

4

epitopes; HLA-A01:01 TTDPSFLGRY (11%), and TTDPSFLGRYM (14%), in some patient-specific T cell

5

repertoires (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure 2, and Supplementary Table 5). We validated the

6

presence of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cells identified with our pMHC multimer-based T cell detection

7

technology using functional analysis in selected patient samples (Supplementary Figure 3).

8

In total, we identified T cell responses to 142 pMHC complexes corresponding to 122 unique T cell

9

epitopes across the ten analyzed HLAs (Figure 1E). HLA-A01:01, A02:01, and B15:01 dominated in terms

10

of the total number of identified epitopes as well as the immunogenicity score (i.e., the number of T cell

11

responses normalized to the number of probing pMHC multimers and the number of patients analyzed)

12

(Figure 1F). HLA-A03:01 and C07:01 specific peptides showed the least T cell reactivity (three epitopes

13

each) despite being analyzed in nine and six patients, respectively (Figure 1E). Most of the immunogenic

14

epitopes were mapped to the ORF1 protein, followed by S and ORF3 proteins (Figure 1G and H, and

15

Supplementary Table 5). Given the size difference of the viral proteins, the ‘immunogenicity score’ was

16

used to evaluate their relative contribution to T cell recognition. Based on such evaluation, we observe

17

that peptides derived from ORF3 displayed the highest relative immunogenicity (in terms of T cell

18

recognition), followed by ORF1 protein (Figure 1H). Of the 122 epitopes recognized by T cells in the

19

patient cohort, 13 were determined as ‘immunodominant’ based on the presence of T cell recognition in

20

two or more patients, and prevalence of >25% in the tested samples with the given HLA molecule

21

(Figure 1I). Among these, a very robust HLA associated immunodominance was observed for two of the

22

epitopes: HLA-A01:01-TTDPSFLGRY-specific (and its variant peptides TTDPSFLGRYM and HTTDPSFLGRY),

23

with specific T cells detected in all five analyzed patients (estimated frequency reaching up to 25% of

24

total CD8+ T cells); and HLA-B07:02-SPRWYFYYL, with specific T cells observed in four of the five patients

evaluated (estimated frequency up to 10%) (Figure 1I). Surprisingly, in our patient cohort, none of the

2

immunodominant epitopes were derived from the S protein, despite this being the second-largest

3

protein (Figure 1J).

4

In summary, we report SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell immunity towards several epitopes and the

5

recurrent finding of T cell recognition towards a few immunodominant epitopes. The ORF1 protein

6

contributes the most to T cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2, but is also by far the largest group of proteins.

7

When protein size is taken into account, ORF3 and ORF1 contributed the most for both immunogenic

8

and immunodominant epitopes.

9

Large-scale reactivity towards SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides in healthy individuals

10

Next, we analyzed healthy individuals for T cell recognition against all 3141 SARS-CoV-2-derived

11

peptides. We selected two healthy donor cohorts; representing COVID-19 unexposed healthy individuals

12

(HD-1; n=18, PBMCs collected before COVID-19 outbreak), and healthcare staff at high-risk of SARS-CoV-

13

2 exposure but not tested COVID-19 positive (HD2; n=20, PBMCs collected during COVID-19 outbreak).

14

CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 unexposed healthy individuals showed large-scale T cell recognition towards

15

SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides from across the whole viral genome (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 4,

16

and Supplementary Table 6a). Cumulatively, 214 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides were recognized by T

17

cells in 16 out of the 18 analyzed samples. Despite such broad T cell-recognition, most of the T cell

18

populations were of low-frequency, never exceeding 1% of total CD8+ T cells. The high-risk COVID-19

19

healthy cohort showed similar T cell recognition towards 178 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (Figure 2B,

20

Supplementary Figure 4, and Supplementary Table 6b). SARS-CoV-2 recognizing T cell populations in

21

this cohort were also of low frequency (less than 1% of total CD8+ T cells) and were identified in 15 of

22

the 20 donors. Interestingly, while T cell recognition was seen at a substantial level in both the healthy

23

donor cohorts; the staining-index of the pMHC multimer binding in healthy donors was significantly

lower than similarly observed in patients (Figure 2C). This might indicate a lower TCR avidity to the

2

probed pMHC in healthy individual compared to COVID-19 patients, and could be due to potential cross-

3

reactivity from existing T cell populations raised against other coronaviruses (such as common cold

4

viruses HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) that share some level of sequence

5

homology with SARS-CoV-2, as suggested in recent reports (Le Bert et al., 2020; Braun et al., 2020;

6

Mateus et al., 2020).

7

Forty-one of the COVID-19 immunogenic peptides, including eight of the immunodominant peptides,

8

identified in the patient cohort were also recognized by T cells of healthy donors (Figure 2D), this

9

includes the two most frequently observed epitopes of SARS-CoV-2: HLA-A01:01-TTDPSFLRGY and HLA-

10

B07:02-SPRWYFYYL (Figure 2E). For further validation, we expanded T cells in-vitro from several COVID-

11

19 unexposed healthy donors and measured T cell binding using fluorophore-labeled pMHC tetramers.

12

Based on in-vitro peptide-driven expansion pMHC tetramer binding T cell populations were verified in

13

multiple donors for SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides, including immunodominant epitopes across four HLAs

14

(A01:01-TTDPSFLRGY, A02:01-LLLLDRLNQL, A02:01-KLKDCVMYA, A24:02-FYAYLRKHF, and B07:02-

15

SPRWYFYYL) (Figure 2F). Although these T cell responses were of low magnitude, a functional response

16

(measured by IFN-γ and TNF-α) was observed in these in-vitro expanded T cell cultures when re-

17

stimulated with individual peptide epitopes (Figure 2G) or epitope pools (Supplementary Figure 5B).

18

Altogether, we show a full spectrum of functionally validated T cell recognition towards SARS-CoV-2-

19

derived peptides in healthy donors; this is detected at low frequency and seems to have low-avidity

20

interaction (as determined based on the staining index of the pMHC multimer interaction).

Strong and distinct activation profile exhibited by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19

2

patients

3

Since our study design integrated T cell phenotype characterization in combination with the SARS-CoV-

4

2-specific T cell identification, we evaluated and compared phenotypic characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2

5

reactive T cell populations in COVID-19-infected patients and healthy donors. This also allowed us to

6

evaluate whether the multimer-specific T cell profile of the high-risk COVID-19 healthy cohort (HD-2) has

7

any distinct features compared to the unexposed cohort (HD-1). Dimensionality reduction visualization

8

of SARS-CoV-2 multimer positive T cells using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

9

showed distinct clustering for the patient cohort compared to the two healthy donor cohorts (Figure

10

3A). Patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 multimer-positive T cells were distinguished with higher expression of

11

activation markers CD38, CD69, CD39, HLA-DR, CD57, and reduced expression of CD8 and CD27 (Figure

12

3B). These features were found unique to SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, as no difference was observed

13

between the three cohorts in similar analysis for CEF-specific multimer positive T cells (Supplementary

14

Figures 6A and B). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in patients and healthy donor cohorts

15

showed a similar distribution of memory subsets, effector memory (EM) CCR7- CD45RA-; central memory

16

(CM), CCR7+ CD45RA-; and terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA), CCR7-CD45RA+; and naïve

17

(CCR7+, CD45RA+) phenotype (Supplementary Figures 7A and B). However, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells of

18

the patient cohort showed unique clustering (UMAP) of EM and TEMRA and these two subsets

19

particularly showed strong expression of the T cell activation markers (Supplementary Figures 7C and D)

20

compared to both healthy donor cohorts.

21

Phenotype analysis demonstrated a highly activated state of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, with a

22

significantly higher fraction of such T cells expressing the inflammation marker (CD38) and early-stage

23

activation markers (CD39, CD69, and HLA-DR), and showed a late-differentiated effector memory profile

(reduced CD27) together with increased CD57 expression (not significant) compared to the two healthy

2

donor cohorts (Figure 3C). We did not observe activation of SARS-CoV-2 specific multimer-positive T

3

cells in the high-risk COVID-19 healthy cohort, except for non-significant trends for reduced CD27 and

4

increased CD57 expression (Figure 3C). Furthermore, the highly activated and differentiated T cell

5

phenotype in the COVID-19 patients was associated with the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and not to the

6

CEF-specific T cells detected in this cohort (Figure 3D). To further characterize the SARS-CoV-2-specific T

7

cell phenotype, we compared the expression of the T cell activation markers in combination with

8

inflammatory response marker CD38 on multimer positive CD8+ T cells across the three cohorts, which

9

showed significantly enhanced expression of activation molecules (CD39, CD69, and HLA-DR) and PD-1

10

inhibitory receptor on CD38+ T cells only in the patient cohort (Figure 3E and F).

11

Altogether, these results demonstrate highly active and proliferative SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell

12

responses in COVID-19-infected patients, and distinguishes them from the potential cross-reactive T cell

13

repertoire detected in healthy donors.

14

The severity of COVID-19 disease correlates with enhanced activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific

15

CD8 T cells

16

To dissect the association of T cells with COVID-19 disease severity, we next evaluated the phenotype

17

characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells in the patient cohort related to their requirement for

18

hospital care. Our patient cohort consists of severely diseased patients requiring hospitalization

19

(hospitalized; n = 11) and patients with mild symptoms not requiring hospital care (outpatient; n = 7).

20

Substantially higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells and increased total number of

21

epitopes were detected in samples from hospitalized patients compared to outpatient samples (Figure

22

4A). Comparing the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell population (multimer+) between hospitalized and

23

outpatients for phenotype markers, we observed a clear trend in increased expression of CD38, CD39,

CD69, HLA-DR (non-significant), and PD-1 (significant) (Figure 4B). Furthermore, measuring co-

2

expression of immune activation marker CD38 together with CD39, CD69, PD-1, and HLA-DR showed a

3

strong elevation of these combinations of activation markers in hospitalized patients (Figure 4C and D),

4

suggesting a role for SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 infection. It should be noted that

5

samples from hospitalized patients might have been collected relatively later after the time-of-infection

6

compared to the outpatient cohort, which could influence the level of T cell reactivity. To solve this

7

potential bias, ongoing studies are addressing (in detail) the kinetics of the T cell response after time-of-

8

infection.

A fraction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes share sequence homology with widely circulating common

11

cold coronaviruses

12

Pre-existing T cells immunity, in the context of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in COVID-19 unexposed

13

healthy individuals, has been reported by several studies (Le Bert et al., 2020; Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni

14

et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Nelde et al., 2020), and it has been hypothesized that this is due to the

15

shared sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and other common cold coronaviruses

16

(HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). Having evaluated the full spectrum of minimal

17

epitopes for T cell recognition, we set out to evaluate the sequence homology at the peptide level, and

18

its correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity observed in the healthy donors. First, we searched

19

for any immunogenic hot-spots across the full SARS-CoV-2 proteome by comparing the number of

20

identified epitopes (in the patient cohort) to the total number of predicted peptides in any given region

21

of the proteins. Generally, the epitopes were spread over the full length of the protein sequences, while

22

clustering in minor groups throughout all regions of the viral proteome (Figure 5A). Regions indicated by

binding peptides in a given region. Both the C- and N-terminal regions of the ORF1 seem to hold fewer T

2

cell epitopes compared to the rest of this protein. When similarly illustrating the T cell recognition of

3

SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides observed in healthy donors, we detected a comparable spread of T cell

4

recognition in the healthy donor cohort. Interestingly, most T cell epitope clusters in the patient cohort

5

coincide with T cell recognition in the healthy donor cohort. There are few areas that distinguish the T

6

cell recognition observed in healthy donors from that observed in patients, these include: the C- and N-

7

terminal regions of ORF1, parts of the N, and in general, a higher level of T cell recognition to S. In all

8

those areas, T cell recognition in healthy donors exceed the observation from the patients (Figure 5A).

9

Interestingly, when evaluating the prevalence of T cell responses detected towards the

10

immunodominant epitopes identified either from the patient (Figure 1I) or the healthy donor cohort

11

(Supplementary Figure 4C), we observed that most T cell responses dominating in patients are also

12

detected in healthy donors, while a large fraction of epitopes domination in healthy individual are

exclusively detected in this cohort (Figure 5B). This points to a substantial degree of cross-recognition to

14

SARS-CoV-2 from pre-existing T cell populations, and that such populations might, to a large extent,

15

drive the further expansion of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

16

To further elucidate the potential origin of such a cross-reactive T cell population in the healthy donors

17

cohort, we next evaluated the sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I binding peptides with the four

18

common cold coronaviruses; HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E. With a variation limit of up to

19

two amino acids in each peptide sequence, 15% of the total predicted peptides showed sequence

20

similarity with one or more HCoV peptide sequence (Figure 5C, grey pie). Among the T cell recognized

21

peptides, in both the patient and healthy donor cohorts, respectively, this fraction was comparable with

22

19% and 16% of T cell recognized peptides sharing sequence homology with one or more HCoV (Figure

23

5C). As an alternative approach the similarities were calculated by kernel method for amino acid

24

sequences using BLOSUM62, indicating comparable sequence similarity of peptides recognized by T cells

and those not recognized in reference to HCoV. However, interestingly, peptides of lowest similarity

2

were not recognized by T cells in the patient cohort (Supplementary Figure 8).

3

As T cell cross-recognition can often be driven by a few key interaction points, predominantly in the

4

‘core’ of the peptide sequence (i.e., position 3–8) (Calis et al., 2013; Frankild et al., 2008), we restricted

5

the sequence similarity to the core of the peptide that would most likely interact with the TCR(Bentzen

6

et al., 2018). Based on the protein-core only, up to 74% of all the identified epitopes showed sequence

7

homology to HCoV (one or more) (Figure 5C), suggesting these common cold viruses as a potential

8

source of the observed low-avidity interactions in healthy donors. Further, when evaluating peptides

9

frequently recognized by T cells in both the patients and the healthy cohort, we find evidence of

10

substantial homology, as exemplified with the peptide sequences listed in Figure 5D. However, similar

11

sequence homology is observed for the peptide sequences that are recognized only in the patient

12

cohort (Figure 5D). Thus, at present, our data points to substantial T cell cross recognition being

13

involved in shaping the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, however, we find no specific

14

enrichment of T cell recognition to peptide sequences with large sequence homology compared to the

15

total peptide library being evaluated, and the responses that are identified in the patient samples only

16

does not hold a more SARS-CoV-2 unique signature than those recognized in both cohorts. Interestingly,

17

however, ORF1 being one of the elements displaying the highest T cell recognition immunogenicity, also

18

display the highest sequence identity to HCoV (40%, as oppose to 22-34% for all other SARS-CoV-2

19

proteins, calculated using direct sequence alignment). Seeking to fully understand the role and origin of

20

the underlying T cell cross-recognition will likely require an in-depth evaluation of pre- and post-

21

infection samples.

Discussion

2

We identified CD8+ T cell responses to 122 epitopes in 18 COVID-19 patients after screening for T cell

3

recognition based on 3141 peptides derived from the full SARS-CoV-2 genome, and selected based on

4

their predicted HLA-binding capacity. Of these, a few dominant T cell epitopes were recognized in the

5

majority of the patients. Strikingly, both dominant and subdominant T cell epitopes were cross-

6

recognized by low-level existing T cell populations in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed healthy individuals. We

7

have observed that the SARS-CoV-2 dominant epitopes mount very strong T cell responses, with up to

8

25% of all CD8+ lymphocytes specific to a single epitope (two overlapping peptides with same peptide

9

core).

10

Pre-existing immunity based on cross-reactive T cells can influence how our immune system reacts upon

11

viral exposure. One way could be via faster expansion of pre-existing memory cells upon initial exposure

12

to viral infection. A similar outcome and benefit of pre-existing T cell immunity have been shown in the

13

case of flu pandemic virus H1N1 (Sridhar et al., 2013; Wilkinson et al., 2012). Additionally,

14

hyperactivation of pre-existing T cells can contribute to short- and long-term disease severity via

15

inflammation and autoimmunity, as increased production of IFN-γ by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells has been

16

observed in severe COVID-19 patients (Wang et al., 2020). Furthermore, it has been reported (Ehrenfeld

17

et al., 2020) that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a triggering factor for autoimmune reactions and severe

18

pneumonia with sepsis leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bone-marrow affection

19

with pancytopenia and organ-specific autoimmunity (Gagiannis et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2020;

20

Hersby et al., 2020). Importantly, pre-existing T cell immunity can influence vaccination outcomes, as

21

they can induce a faster and better immune response. The ORF1 protein regions are highly conserved

22

within coronaviruses (Cui et al., 2019), and show the highest HCoV identity among SARS-CoV-2 proteins;

23

and most of the immunodominant epitopes that we have identified belong to the ORF1 region. Thus, a

24

detailed evaluation of these T cell epitopes could be of value in vaccine design.

1

Most vaccine-development efforts are currently focusing on mounting antibody-responses to the spike

2

protein, with limited focus on T cell immunity. However, studies point to a potential fast decline in

3

antibody titers after infection (Seow et al., 2020; Vabret, 2020), and such kinetics might be similar

4

following vaccinations. Thus, the involvement of T cell immunity might be a relevant focus if antibody

5

titers cannot sufficiently protect against infections. In such scenarios, T cell immunity can sustain the

6

antibody responses and provide a direct source of T cells clearing virus-infected cells. For the

7

involvement of T cell immunity in vaccine development, our data suggest that the inclusion of other

8

virus proteins, such as ORF1 or 3, might be highly relevant.

9

T cell recognition of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides in both COVID-19 patients and healthy donors has

10

prompted us to understand the role of T cell cross-reactivity in controlling infections. In recent years,

11

technology improvements in TCR characterization have allowed us to interrogate the TCR-pMHC

12

interaction from a structural approach, while obtaining experimental information related to the peptide

13

amino acids that are crucial to T cell recognition (Adams et al., 2016; Bentzen and Hadrup, 2019;

14

Birnbaum et al., 2014; Garcia et al., 1996, 1998; Linette et al., 2013). Such efforts have taught us that T

15

cell cross-recognition is very difficult to predict, without knowing the precise interaction required for the

16

given TCR, as even T cell epitopes with as low as 40% sequence homology can be recognized by a given

17

TCR (Bentzen et al., 2018). Therefore, the underlining source of T cell cross-reactivity might arise from a

18

larger set of epitopes within the HCoV viruses, including sequences with larger variation than those

19

evaluated here (i.e., max. two amino acid variants per peptide sequence/peptide core).

20

While the T cell recognition itself was largely overlapping in identity between patients and healthy

21

donors, the magnitude for the T cell responses and, in particular, the T cell phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-

22

specific T cells was substantially different. A unique phenotype characterization demonstrated a strong

23

activation profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells only in patients. This strong ‘activation signature’ (high

24

expression of CD38, CD39, CD69, PD1) was further enhanced in patients requiring hospitalization. Such

1

strong and highly activated T cell responses should be able to clear the virus, and hence our data further

2

support the notion that some severely affected patients might suffer from hyperactivation of their T cell

3

compartment as a consequence of their primary viral infection, which may even be cleared.

4

Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate a substantial role for T cell recognition in

5

COVID-19, and in-depth evaluations in larger cohorts over time will provide essential insight to the role

6

of such T cells in disease severity and how pre-existing T cell immunity can be leveraged to fight novel

7

infections.

Methods

2

Clinical samples

3

Approval for the study design and sample collection was obtained from the Commitee on Health

4

Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark. All included patients and health care employees gave

5

their informed written consent for inclusion. PBMC samples from 18 COVID-19 infected patients were

6

used in this study. Blood samples were collected as close as possible to the first COVID-19 positive test.

7

The patient cohort included samples from individuals with severe symptoms who required hospital care

8

(hospitalized; n = 11) and patients with mild symptoms not requiring hospital care (outpatient; n = 7).

9

For hospitalized patients, we collected full data from the medical record regarding disease course, age,

10

gender, travel history, performance status, symptoms, comorbidity, medications, laboratory findings,

11

diagnostic imaging, treatment, need of oxygen, need for intensive care, and an overall estimate of

12

disease severity (Supplementary Table 2). For outpatients, we used a questionnaire to collect data on

13

comorbidity, travel history, medications, and performance status.

14

COVID-19 infection was diagnosed by one of the four platforms; BGI (BGI Covid-19 RT-PCR kit),

15

PantherFusion (Hologic), Roche Flow (Roche MagNA Pure 96, Roche LightCycler 480 II real-time PCR),

16

and Qiaflow (QIAsymphony or RotorGene, Qiagen). In the last three platforms, LightMix Modular SARS-

17

CoV (COVID-19) E-gene (# 53-0776-96) has been used. The diversity of platforms used were due to

18

supply issues. All platforms were validated using validation kits and panels from the Statens Serum

19

Institute (SSI), Denmark. Most patients had more than one positive test for COVID-19. Swabs, sputum,

20

and tracheal secretion were used depending on the setting.

1

For the pre-COVID-19 healthy donor cohort (n = 18), we used samples collected prior to October 2019

2

and obtained from the central blood bank, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, in an anonymized form.

3

Additionally, we included 20 health care employees from Herlev Hospital during the COVID-19

4

pandemic, who were at high risk of COVID-19 infection but not positive, as a cohort to follow immune

5

responses in a potentially exposed population.

6

PBMCs from all three cohorts were isolated immediately after sampling using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE

7

Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation and were cryopreserved thereafter at a density of 2–20 ×

8

106 cells/mL.

SARS-CoV-2 peptide selection

10

Potential HLA class I binding peptides were predicted from the complete set of 8–11mer peptides

11

contained within the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank ID

12

MN908947.3) to a set of ten prevalent and functionally diverse HLA molecules (HLA-A01:01, HLA-

13

A02:01, HLA-A03:01, HLA-A24:02, HLA-B07:02, HLA-B08:01, HLA-B15:01 HLA-C06:02, HLA-C07:01, HLA-

14

C07:02) using a preliminary version of NetMHCpan-4.1

15

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan/index_v0.php)[PMID: 32406916]. For peptides predicted

16

from ORF1 protein, a percentile rank binding threshold of 0.5% was used, and for peptides derived from

17

all other proteins, a threshold of 1% was used. Altogether, 2203 peptides were selected, binding to one

18

or more HLA molecules, generating 3141 peptide-HLA pairs for experimental evaluation (Supplementary

19

Table 1). All peptides were custom synthesized by Pepscan Presto BV, Lelystad, The Netherlands.

Peptide synthesis was done at a 2 µmol scale with UV and mass spec quality control analysis for 5%

random peptides by the supplier.

1

All ten MHC-I monomer types were produced using methods previously described (Saini et al., 2013).

2

Briefly, MHC-I heavy chain and human ß2-microglobulin (hß2m) were expressed in Escherichia coli using

3

pET series expression plasmids. Soluble denatured proteins of the heavy chain and hß2m were

4

harvested using inclusion body preparation. The folding of these molecules was initiated in the presence

5

of UV labile HLA specific peptide ligands (Hadrup et al., 2009a). HLA-A02:01 and A24:02 molecules were

6

folded and purified empty, as described previously (Saini et al., 2019). Folded MHC-I molecules were

7

biotinylated using the BirA biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit (Avidity, LLC- Aurora, Colorado),

8

and MHC-I monomers were purified using size exclusion chromatography (HPLC, Waters Corporation,

9

USA). All MHC-I folded monomers were quality controlled for their concentration, UV degradation, and

10

biotinylation efficiency, and stored at -80°C until further use.

11

DNA-barcoded multimer library preparation

12

The DNA-barcoded multimer library was prepared using the method developed by Bentzen et al.

13

(Bentzen et al., 2016). Unique barcodes were generated by combining different A and B oligos, with

14

each barcode representing a 5’ biotinylated unique DNA sequence. These barcodes were attached to

15

phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC) and streptavidin-conjugated dextran (Fina BioSolutions,

16

Rockville, MD, USA) by incubating them at 4°C for 30 min to generate a DNA-barcode-dextran library of

17

1325 unique barcode specificities. SARS-CoV-2 pMHC libraries were generated by incubating 200 µM

18

peptide of each peptide with 100 µg/mL of respective MHC molecules for 1 h using UV-mediated

19

peptide exchange (HLA-A01:01, A03:01, B07:02, B08:01, B15:01, C06:02, C07:01, and C07:02) or direct

20

binding to empty MHC molecules (HLA-A02:01 and A24:02). HLA-specific DNA-barcoded multimer

21

libraries were then generated by incubating pMHC monomers to their corresponding DNA barcode

22

dextrans at 4°C for 30 min, thus providing a DNA barcode-labeled dextran for each peptide-MHC (pMHC

23

multimer) specifically to probe respective T cell population. A similar process was followed to generate

T cell staining with DNA-barcoded pMHC multimers and phenotype panel

4

All COVID-19 patient and healthy donor samples were HLA genotyped for HLA-A, B, and C loci (IMGM

5

Laboratories GmbH, Germany, next-generation sequencing) (Supplementary Table 7). Patient and

6

healthy donor HLA-matching SARS-CoV2 and CEF pMHC multimer libraries were pooled (as described

7

previously (Bentzen et al., 2016)) and incubated with 5–10 × 106 PBMCs (thawed and washed twice in

8

RPMI + 10% FCS, and washed once in barcode cytometry buffer) for 15 min at 37°C at a final volume of

9

60 µL. Cells were then mixed with 40 µL of phenotype panel containing surface marker antibodies

10

(Supplementary Table 3) and a dead cell marker (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR; Invitrogen L10119) (final

11

dilution 1/1000), and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with barcode cytometry

12

buffer and fixed in 1% PFA.

13

Cells fixed after staining with pMHC-multimers were acquired on a FACSAria flow cytometer instrument

14

(AriaFusion, Becton Dickinson) and gated by the FACSDiva acquisition program (Becton Dickinson), and

15

all the PE-positive (SARS-CoV-2 multimer binding) and APC-positive (CEF multimer binding) cells of CD8+

16

gate were sorted into pre-saturated tubes (2% BSA, 100 µl barcode cytometry buffer) (Supplementary

17

Figure 9A). Sorted cells belonging to each sample were then subjected to PCR amplification of its

18

associated DNA barcode(s). Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g, and the supernatant was

19

discarded with minimal residual volume. The remaining pellet was used as the PCR template for each of

20

the sorted samples and amplified using the Taq PCR Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, 201443) and sample-

21

specific forward primer (serving as sample identifier) A-key36. PCR-amplified DNA barcodes were

22

purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, 28104) and sequenced at PrimBio (USA) using

23

the Ion Torrent PGM 314 or 316 chip (Life Technologies).

DNA-barcode sequence analysis and identification of pMHC specificities

2

To process the sequencing data and automatically identify the barcode sequences, we designed a

3

specific software package, ‘Barracoda’ (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?Barracoda-1.8).

4

This software tool identifies the barcodes used in a given experiment, assigns sample ID and pMHC

5

specificity to each barcode, and calculates the total number of reads and clonally reduced reads for each

6

pMHC-associated DNA barcode. Furthermore, it includes statistical processing of the data. Details are

7

given in Bentzen et al. (Bentzen et al., 2016). The analysis of barcode enrichment was based on methods

8

designed for the analysis of RNA-seq data and was implemented in the R package edgeR. Fold changes in

9

read counts mapped to a given sample relative to mean read counts mapped to triplicate baseline

10

samples were estimated using normalization factors determined by the trimmed mean of M-values. P-

11

values were calculated by comparing each experiment individually to the mean baseline sample reads

12

using a negative binomial distribution with a fixed dispersion parameter set to 0.1 (Bentzen et al., 2016).

13

False-discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Specific barcodes

14

with an FDR < 0.1% were defined as significant, determining T cell recognition in the given sample. At

15

least 1/1000 reads associated with a given DNA barcode relative to the total number of DNA barcode

16

reads in that given sample was set as the threshold to avoid false-positive detection of T cell populations

17

due to the low number of reads in the baseline samples. T cell frequency associated with each

18

significantly enriched barcode was measured based on the % read count of the associated barcode out

19

of the total % multimer-positive CD8+ T cells population. In order to exclude potential pMHC elements

20

binding to T cells in a non-specific fashion, non-HLA-matching healthy donor material was included as a

21

negative control. Any T cell recognition determined in this samples was subtracted from the full data

22

set.

PBMCs from healthy donors were expanded in-vitro using pMHC-dextran complexes conjugated with

2

SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides and cytokines (IL-2 and IL-21) for 2 weeks either with single pMHC

3

specificity or with a pool of up to ten pMHC specificities. PBMCs were expanded for 2 weeks in X-vivo

4

media (Lonza, BE02-060Q) supplemented with 5% human serum (Gibco, 1027-106). Expanded cells were

5

used to measure peptide-specific T cell activation or stained using pMHC tetramers to detect T cells

6

recognizing SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

7

In-vitro expanded healthy donor PBMCs were examined for SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells using

were generated using direct peptide loading (HLA-A02:01 and A24:02) or UV-mediated peptide

15

min at 4°C, followed by addition of D-biotin (Sigma) at 25 µM final concentration to block any free

16

binding site. pMHC tetramers for each specificity were generated in two colors by incubating pMHC

monomers and mixed in a 1:1 ratio before staining the cells. Expanded cells were stained with 1 µL of

T cell functional analysis

For functional evaluation of T cells from PBMCs of COVID-19 patients or PBMCs expanded from healthy

donors, 1–2 × 106 cells were incubated with 1 µM of SARS-CoV-2 minimal epitope or pool of up to ten

dilution 1/500) were used as a positive control, and HLA-specific irrelevant peptides were used as

11

negative controls. Surface marker antibodies CD3-FITC (BD Biosciences 345764 (final dilution 1/20)),

12

CD4-BUV395 (BD Biosciences 742738 (final dilution 1/300), CD8-BV480 (BD Biosciences B566121 (final

13

dilution 1/50)), and dead cell marker (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR; Invitrogen L10119) (final dilution

14

1/1000)) were used to identify CD8+ T cells producing intracellular cytokines (Gating strategy,

Flow cytometry analysis and UMAP

17

For phenotype analysis, all samples were analyzed using FlowJo data analysis software (FlowJO LLC).

18

Frequencies of specific cell populations were calculated according to the gating strategy shown in

19

Supplementary Figure 9B. For combinatorial tetramers staining, T cell binding to specific-pMHC

20

tetramers was identified using the gating plan described in the original study (Hadrup et al., 2009b). For

21

UMAP analysis (McInnes et al., 2018), FCS files of samples from the patient and healthy cohorts were

22

concatenated (160,000 total cells), downsampled (FlowJo plugin), and visualized using UMAP (Version

Sequence homology analyses

4

To evaluate the homology between SARS-Cov2 and HCoV, both epitopes (peptides recognized by T cells)

5

and ligands (peptide not recognized by T cells) were mapped to their respective source protein from the

6

SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Enrichment analysis of the epitopes in the given region of the proteins was based

7

on testing whether the count of observed epitopes exceeded what we expected from the number of

8

ligands tested at each position. Epitopes were considered successes and the count of ligands were

9

regarded as the number of trials in a binomial test. The probability of success was derived from the

10

average ratio of epitope to ligand per position across each protein. The test was ‘one-sided’ with a

11

significance level at 0.05.

12

The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 ligands and epitopes from both patient and healthy donor cohorts to a set

13

of human common cold corona viruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43) was tested

14

using two methods. The first approach utilized a kernel method for amino acid sequences using

15

BLOSUM62 (Shen et al., 2012). The second approach was a simple string search allowing up to two

16

mismatches. Based on the second approach each epitope was categorized by how many, if any, of the

17

common cold viruses it would match with. Both methods were applied to the full peptide length and to

18

the peptide core.

19

Data processing and statistics

20

T cell recognition was determined based on the DNA-barcoded pMHC multimer analysis and evaluated

21

through ‘baracoda’ (see above). The data was plotted using python 3.7.4. For all plots, peptide

22

sequences with no significant enrichments are shown as gray dots and all peptide with a negative

3

performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.) (Figure 2C; Figure 3C, D, F; Figure 4A, B, D) or

5

GraphPad Prism, all p values are indicated in figure legends. Flow Cytometry data were analyzed using

6

FlowJo (version 10). Immunogenicity scores (Figure 1F, H; Supplementary Figure 4) were calculated (as

7

%) by dividing total identified T cell reactivity associated with a HLA or protein with the total number of

8

specificities analyzed in a given cohort (number of peptides multiplied by number of patient with a given

9

HLA). Staining index (Figure 2C) was calculated as; ((mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of multimer+ cells

10

– MFI of multimer- cells)/2 × standard deviation (SD) of multimer- cells)). MFI of multimer+ and multimer-

11
