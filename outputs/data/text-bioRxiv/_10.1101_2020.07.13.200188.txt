Abstract
The high mortality of severe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases
is mainly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is
characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barriers,
pulmonary edema and consequently inflammatory tissue damage. Some but
not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung
damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process1.
Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19
patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in
severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and
KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells
could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier reestablishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+
progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population
into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis
showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into
host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which
restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell
infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients
with massive leukocyte infiltration. Altogether this work uncovered the
mechanism that how various lung progenitor cells work in concert to prevent
and replenish alveoli loss post severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is the major health concern
worldwide. Pathological studies of COVID-19 postmortem lungs have shown
that the effect of mild virus infection is limited in upper airway and had little
influence on the lung tissue integrity. However, severe virus infection leads to
diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) characterized apoptosis, desquamation of
alveolar epithelial cells, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveolar cavity,
which could eventually lead to hypoxemia, pulmonary tissue fibrosis and death
of patients. Hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells (ATII) was also noted in most
cases, which could suggest an undergoing regenerative process mediated by
ATII lung progenitor cells2-4. In order to fully elucidate the epithelial damage and
repair mechanism, we analyzed the single cell transcriptomic profile of lung
BALF to quantify the major events post infection and focused on structural
epithelial cells. BALF is a useful technique for sampling the human lung,
providing landscape information of the whole lower respiratory tract. The
current study was based on public scRNA-Seq datasets on BALF cells from
three patients with moderate COVID-19 (M1 – M3), six patients with
severe/critical infection (S1–S6) and four healthy controls (HC1–HC4)5,6.
Firstly, we performed unsupervised clustering analysis on the whole
dataset to separate EPCAM+/TPPP3+/KRT18+ epithelial cells from other cells
types (mostly immune cells) in the BALF (Extended Data Fig.1a,b). Reclustering analysis identified 12 epithelial cell clusters, among them 4 were
identified to be co-expressing immune markers which could be epithelial cells

SCGB1A1+/MUC5AC+), various types of ciliated cells (Cluster 1-5. FOXJ1+),
alveolar cells (Cluster 6. HOPX+/SPC+). Most interestingly, a cluster of lung
progenitor cells (Cluster 7. TM4SF1+/KRT5+/SOX9+) were identified, which will
be analyzed in details as below (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 2).
When we compare the HC group with the other two infected groups, we
found significant higher proportion of alveolar cell clusters (Cluster 6) in the
BALF of patients with severe infection (Fig. 1b-d). Of note, the HOPX+/AGER+
type I alveolar cells (ATI) and SPC+/LAMP3+ ATII were almost undetectable in
the BALFs of healthy control persons due to the tissue integrity of their lungs.
In contrast, in the severe COVID-19 patients, both ATI and ATII cell markers
were detected in the lavage fluid, probably due to the tissue collapse and
desquamation of alveolar cells (Fig. 1e). This phenomenon was not obvious in
moderate COVID-19 patients, which was also consistent with previous
pathological observation7. Therefore, the number of alveolar cells (or the
alveolar marker gene expression level) in BALFs could be clinically used to
measure the structural integrity of lung, which could serve as an index of
disease severity for COVID-19 patients.
In the BALFs of patients with severe infection, we also found significant
higher proportions of progenitor cell clusters (Cluster 7) (Fig. 1b-d). Multiple
stem/progenitor cell populations have been reported to play critical roles in

damage repair after various types of acute lung injury8. Among them, a rare
population of Wnt-responsive ATII is regarded as the major facultative
progenitors9,10, which can be specifically marked by TM4SF1 expression in
human lung11. In current study, we found that in the patients of severe group,
the number of TM4SF1+ cells increased remarkably, which implicated the rapid
activation of such progenitor cells by tissue damage (Fig. 2a,b). Consistently,
we observed co-expression of TM4SF1 and mature alveolar cell markers,
AGER (also known as RAGE) and SPC, in a substantial proportion of cells in
patients of severe group (Fig. 2c). These results suggested that the TM4SF1+
progenitor cells had the potential to differentiate into mature alveolar cells and
regenerate the damaged alveoli of COVID-19 patients.
KRT5+ cells are also reported to have lung stem/progenitor characteristics.
Such cells are originated from various primitive progenitors in proximal or distal
airways and could expand/migrate to inflamed damaged lung parenchymal
region to form “KRT5 pods” once activated by various types of tissue injury
including influenza virus infection12-17. Recent studies showed that the
expanded KRT5 cells could give rise to new pulmonary epithelium, which was
now believed to have important epithelial barrier function to protect the lung
tissue from further damage11,17,18. Specific ablation of the newly expanded
KRT5+ cells resulted in persistent hypoxemia, confirming the contribution of
these cells in recovery of lung function15. In current study, we found that in the
patients of severe group, the number of KRT5+ progenitor cells increased

remarkably, in together with the elevated expression of another related
progenitor marker gene SOX919,20 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2c).
Then we examined the function of genes whose expression level were
significantly up-regulated in KRT5+ cells by Gene Ontology analysis. The
results showed that KRT5+ cells were responsive to the low oxygen condition
of severe COVID-19 patients, and actively participated in the development and
generation of respiratory epithelial system. More importantly, such cells highly
expressed multiple tissue integrity genes including Claudin1, Claudin4, TJP1,
Stratifin, AQP3 and Scnn1A, which were associated with epithelial barrier
establishment, tight junction assembly, maintenance of fluid homeostasis and
prevention of leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 2e). These functions of
KRT5+ cells were rather important for a damaged lung as reconstitution of tight
alveolar barrier between atmosphere and fluid-filled tissue is required for
recovery of normal gas exchange, while persistent disruption of the alveolar
barrier could result in catastrophic consequences including alveolar flooding,
“cytokine storm” attack from the circulating leukocytes and subsequent fibrotic
scarring21.
In order to elucidate the process that how KRT5+ progenitor cells restored
mature alveolar barrier in injured lung, we isolated the mouse KRT5+ progenitor
cells (previously also named distal airway stem cells)15 for transplantation
assay as described in Fig. 3a. Briefly, the cell population was trypsinized into
single-cell suspension and a single cell-derived pedigree clone was propagated,

followed by GFP labeling by lentiviral infection for further analysis.
Immunostaining showed that all cultured GFP+ KRT5+ progenitor cells
expressed KRT5 and P63 marker genes (Fig. 3b). Then we transplanted the
cultured KRT5+ progenitor cells into the bleomycin-injured mouse lung by
intratracheal instillation. Transplanted lungs were evaluated at 30 and 90 days
afterwards. The result showed substantial persistent engraftment of the GFP+
cells into the host lung, which takes up 2.27% and 2.44% of total lung cells on
Day 30 and 90 post transplantation, respectively (Fig. 3c,d). Cryo-sectioning
and immunostaining of the host lung demonstrated that some transplanted
GFP+ KRT5+ progenitor cells differentiated into alveolar barrier cells (ABCs) in
lung parenchyma, establishing a large area of sealed cavities next to
consolidated regions, which efficiently prevented CD45+ immune cell infiltration
into such area (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 3a).
Next we harvested the 30-day and 90-day transplanted lungs and sorted
the engrafted GFP+ single cells for scRNA-Seq analysis. Clustering analysis of
the sequencing data identified three clusters of KRT5+ progenitor cells,
including the most immature P63+ KRT5+ progenitors, the P63- KRT5+
progenitors and the actively cycling Ki67+ KRT5+ progenitors. We also
identified two KRT5- differentiated ABCs which both highly expressed early
alveolar marker HOPX and paracellular adhesion marker Claudin7.

One of

the two ABC clusters highly expressing tight junction marker Occludin (OCLN)
was supposed to be more mature than the other one (Fig. 3f,g). Gene ontology

analysis demonstrated that the P63+ KRT5+ progenitors highly expressed
multiple genes whose function was related to cell stemness maintenance,
chemotaxis and inhibition of cell apoptosis. In contrast, the mature ABC highly
expressed multiple genes (including HOPX, SPD, OCLN, CDH1, Claudin7,
Claudin4, AQP3, etc.) whose function was related to lung morphogenesis, tight
junction assembly and water homeostasis (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c).
To further dissect the lineage relationship between different clusters of
engrafted cells, we performed the Monocle pseudo-time analysis based on the
scRNA-Seq data. The result indicated that the P63+ KRT5+ progenitors could
differentiate into P63- KRT5+ progenitors and immature ABCs, which
eventually give rise to OCLN+ mature ABCs (Fig. 4a,b). In consistent with the
pseudo-time analytical data, we noticed that comparing to the 30-day engrafted
cells, the 90-day engrafted cells had relatively more mature ABCs, less
immature ABCs and less P63-KRT5+ progenitors (Fig. 4c). Altogether such
data revealed that the tight alveolar barrier would be gradually established by
KRT5+ progenitor cell differentiation.
Next we asked which molecular signaling pathways were involved in the
establishment of alveolar barrier. Previous studies indicated that Notch
signaling is critical for activation of P63+ KRT5+ progenitors in lung, but
persistent Notch signaling prevents further differentiation of cells

16.

Consistently, here we found that the expression of multiple Notch pathway
component genes was up-regulated in P63+ KRT5+ progenitors but gradually

down-regulated when the cells were differentiating to mature ABC (Fig. 4d). In
addition, sense of low oxygen level through hypoxia pathway is known to be
critical for the expansion of KRT5+ progenitors22. Here we found that the
hypoxia pathway component gene expressions were relatively low in P63+
KRT5+ progenitors but were gradually up-regulated when the cells were
differentiating to ABC (Fig. 4d). Further gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
also demonstrated that the expression of the hallmark hypoxia gene list
in Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was significantly enriched in
mature ABC (P=0.018) (Fig. 4e). Altogether these data showed that Notch and
hypoxia pathways were important for the regulation of progenitor cell fate.
Lastly, we mapped our scRNA-Seq data of transplanted progenitor cells
back to the COVID-19 BALF scRNA-Seq data to investigate whether any
mature alveolar barrier has been established in patients. We extracted the
mature ABC gene expression signature and evaluate the signature signal in
COVID-19 patients. The result showed that approximately 10% of the epithelial
cells in BALF of severe patients could be annotated as mature ABC, and such
ABC only existed in 4 severe patients (S2, S4, S5 and S6) but not in healthy
persons or other patients (Fig. 4f). So why the 4 patients have much more
mature ABC than others? Interestingly, we found that generally the individuals’
mature ABC cell numbers were positively correlated with their FCN1+
macrophage cell numbers in BALF (P=0.002), and the patient S2, S4, S5 and
S6 had much more FCN1+ macrophages in BALF than most of the other

individuals (Fig. 4g). FCN1+ macrophages were reported to be highly proinflammatory and responsible for the tissue damage in COVID-19 patients5.
Therefore, it seems that the establishment of new alveolar barrier was closely
associated with severity of tissue damage and inflammation at individual level.
Altogether, our current studies uncovered a possible mechanism of lung
repair after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. In those severe patients, the virus
infection led to alveolar cell death and leakage of epithelial barrier, which
resulted in massive flood of proteins-enriched fluids and leukocytes into
alveolar cavity, which finally leading to pulmonary edema and tissue hypoxia.
In this situation, as repair backups, KRT5+ and TM4SF1+ progenitor cell could
be activated by the hypoxia and other multiple microenvironment signals to
expand, migrate and differentiate into new functional cells. Eventually, the
KRT5+ progenitor-derived ABCs could rapidly restore new epithelial barriers to
cover the denuded alveoli and sealed the leakage. Simultaneously, the
TM4SF1+ progenitor cells could gradually regenerate new functional ATII and
ATI cells. The synergic act of two types of progenitor cells could make timely
repair of alveoli in an acute injury scenario (summarized in Fig. 4h). Of course,
there could be more resident or circulating stem/progenitor cells working in
concert with them to achieve maximal repair. Of note, our current studies were
based on limited sample data. Future study within a larger patient cohort, could
further facilitate our understanding of the repair process of COVID-19 patients,
and development of potential progenitor cell-based therapeutic strategies.

Methods
scRNA-seq analysis of BALF cells
Public datasets (GEO: GSE145926) 5and (GEO: GSE128033) 6which contain
scRNA-seq data from BALF cells from three patients with moderate COVID-19
(M1-M3), six patients with severe/critical COVID-19 (S1-S6), three healthy
controls (HC1-HC3) and one fresh BALF (GSM3660650) from a lung transplant
donor (HC4) samples were used for bioinformatic analysis. Seurat v.3 was used
for quality control. The following criteria were then applied to each cell of all
nine patients and four healthy controls: gene number between 200 and 6,000,
UMI count > 1,000 and mitochondrial gene percentage < 0.1. After filtering, a
total of 66,452 cells were left for the following analysis. A filtered gene-barcode
matrix of all samples was integrated with Seurat v.3 to remove batch effects
across different donors. In parameter settings, the first 50 dimensions of
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and principal-component analysis (PCA)
were used.
The filtered gene-barcode matrix was first normalized using ‘LogNormalize’
methods in Seurat v.3 with default parameters. The top 2,000 variable genes
were then identified using the ‘vst’ method in Seurat FindVariableFeatures
function. Variables ‘nCount_RNA’ and ‘percent.mito’ were regressed out in the
scaling step and PCA was performed using the top 2,000 variable genes. Then
UMAP was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the
cells. Meanwhile, graph-based clustering was performed on the PCA-reduced

data for clustering analysis with Seurat v.3. The resolution was set to 1.2 to
obtain a finer result.
Epithelial cells were re-clustered with Seurat v.3. Epithelial cells of all
samples were re-clustered using the same parameter mentioned above in the
clustering step and parameter resolution was set to 0.3. Immune cell clusters
were removed and the other cells were re-clustered using the same parameter
mentioned above in the clustering step and parameter resolution was set to 0.4.
MAST23 in Seurat v.3 (FindAllMarkers function) was used to perform differential
gene expression analysis. For each cluster of epithelial cells, DEGs were
generated relative to all of the other cells. A gene was considered significant
with adjusted P < 0.05 (P values were adjusted by false discovery rate in MAST).
For analysis of engrafted GFP+ cells, single cells were captured and
barcoded in 10x Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). Subsequently, RNA
from the barcoded cells was reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries were
prepared using Chromium Single Cell 3’v3 Reagent Kit (10x Genomics)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing libraries were loaded
on an Illumina NovaSeq with 2×150 paired-end kits at Novogene, China. Raw
sequencing reads were processed using the Cell Ranger v.3.1.0 pipeline from
10X Genomics. In brief, reads were demultiplexed, aligned to the human
GRCh38 genome and UMI counts were quantified per gene per cell to generate
a gene-barcode matrix. Data were aggregated and normalized to the same
sequencing depth, resulting in a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples.

Post-processing, including filtering by number of genes and mitochondrial gene
content expressed per cell, was performed using the Seurat v.3. Genes were
filtered out that were detected in less than 3 cells. A global-scaling
normalization method ' LogNormalize' was used to normalize the data by a
scale factor (10,000). Next, a subset of highly variable genes was calculated
for downstream analysis and a linear transformation (ScaleData) was applied
as a pre-processing step. Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality
reduction was performed with the highly variable genes as input in Seurat
function RunPCA. The top 20 significant PCs were selected for two-dimensional
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), implemented by the Seurat
software with the default parameters. FindCluster in Seurat was used to identify
cell clusters.

Gene functional annotation
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) of differentially expressed genes was implemented by the
ClusterProfiler R package

24.

GO terms with corrected P value less than 0.05

were considered significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes. Dot
plots were used to visualize enriched terms by the enrichplot R package. For
hypoxia gene analysis, the hallmark gene sets in MsigDB

was

applied to our datasets. Genes for ordering cells were selected if they were
expressed in ≥ 1% cells, their mean expression value was ≥ 0.3 and dispersion
empirical value was ≥ 1. Based on the ' DDRTree ' method, the data was
reduced to two dimensional, and then the cells were ordered along the
trajectory.

Correlation analysis of BALF cells and engrafted cells
The scHCL Model27

2726was

used to assess the similarity between BALF cells

and engrafted cells. The expression patterns of highly variable genes of each
cluster of engrafted cells (eg. mature ABC) was taken as reference signatures
to annotate BALF cells. Pearson correlation score was calculated between
each cell type of scRNA-seq data from engrafted cells and each cell of scRNAseq data from BALF cells. Final annotation of each BALF cell was based on the
highest correlation score. Linear regression analysis was performed between
ratio of FCN1+ macrophage cell numbers in BALF and ratio of the epithelial
cells in BALF annotated as mature ABC with 'lm' method.

Cell culture
Mouse lung P63+KRT5+ progenitor cells were isolated and cultured as
previously described 15. Briefly, lung lobes were collected and processed into a

single-cell suspension by protease, trypsin and DNaseI. Dissociated cells were
passed through 70-μm nylon mesh, washed twice with cold F12 medium and
then cultured onto feeder cells(irradiated 3T3-J2 feeder cells) in culture medium
including DMEM/F12, 10% FBS (Hyclone, Australia), Pen/Strep, amphotericin,
and growth factor cocktail as previously described. Cells were grown in a
humidified atmosphere of 7.5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. To generate monoclonal
cell, cells were processed and diluted into single-cell suspension. One single
cell was aspirated and isolated by pipette under microscopy, and then
transferred into 96 well plate to expand.

Animal experiments
C57/B6 mice (6–8 weeks) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co., Ltd. (China) and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions within
an animal care facility (Center of Laboratory Animal, Tongji University,
Shanghai, China). All animals were cared for in accordance with NIH guidelines,
and all animal experiments were performed under the guidance of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tongji University. For the lung
injury mouse model, bleomycin was intratracheally administrated to isofluraneanesthetized mice at a concentration of 3U/kg seven days prior transplantation.
GFP labeled cells suspended in 40uL DMEM (1 million cells per mouse) were
intratracheally transplanted. At distinct time points, mice were sacrificed and
their lung tissue were harvested to detect GFP signal by fluorescence

stereomicroscope (MVX10, Olympus, Japan).

Histology
Tissues were fixed with 4% PFA for 2 hours at room temperature and at 4°C
overnight, followed by embedding in OCT. Immunohistochemistry was
performed following heat antigen retrieval methods and stained with the
following antibodies. GFP (goat, Abcam, 1:1000), Krt5 (rabbit, Thermo Fisher,
1:200), P63 (mouse, abcam, 1:100) and CD45 (rabbit, abcam, 1:200). Primary
antibody was incubated at 4°C overnight, and second antibody at room
temperature for 2h.

FACS sorting of engrafted GFP+ single cells
Transplanted lung was collected and immersed in cold F12 medium with 5%
FBS, followed by being minced into small pieces and digested with dissociation
buffer (F12, 1mg/ml protease, 0.005% trypsin and 10ng/ml DNase I) on shaker
in 37 degree for 1hr. Dissociated cells was filtered through 100-μm cell strainer,
and Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer was used to remove erythrocyte. Cell pellets
were resuspended in DMEM containing with 1% FBS following washing twice,
and then passed over 30-μm strainers. Sorting and subsequent quantification
were performed on BD FACS Arial cytometers. GFP+ cells were gated using
SSC-A vs FSC-A, FSC-H vs FSC-W, and SSC-H vs SSC-W gates, followed by
SSC-A vs FITC-A gate.

Statistics
Differences of median percentage between healthy controls, moderate and

and BALF cells annotated to mature ABCs were compared using a Student’s ttest (two-sided, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) with R ggpubr v.0.2.5.
Differences of gene expression levels between healthy controls, moderate and
severe groups were compared using MAST in Seurat v.3. A gene was
considered significant with adjusted P < 0.05 (P values were adjusted by false
discovery rate in MAST).
