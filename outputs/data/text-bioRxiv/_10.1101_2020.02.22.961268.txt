1 Abstract
The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originating
from Wuhan, China, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and
strong infectivity. Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being
widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still
limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To
address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl
groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of
pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19
causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into
one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent
RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples
within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput
approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a
10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved.

Benefitting from the simplicity and

excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turnaround time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.
2 Introduction
In December, 2019, an unknown pathogen-mediated pneumonia emerged in Wuhan,
China.1 Confirmed cases had been soon diagnosed in other cities in China, as well as in
other countries. On 11 February 2020, as reported by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), this
unknown pneumonia was confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2, previously named as 2019-nCoV). SARS-CoV-2 is etiologically related to the wellknown severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), belonging to the
Coronaviridae family, a type of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus with
an outer envelope. Although the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been fully
revealed and various RT-PCR-based detection kits have been developed, clinical
diagnosis of COVID-19 is still highly challenging.
Due to its high sensitivity in exponentially amplifying RNA molecules, reverse

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is identified as a standard and
routinely used technique for the analysis and quantification of various pathogenic RNA
in laboratories and clinical diagnosis.2 For example, it has been successfully applied for
the detection of SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), and various other viral pathogens including Zika virus (ZIKV), Influenza A virus,
Dengue virus (DENV).3-8 After the outbreak of COVID-19, several methods and kits
based on RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been
reported.9-10 While RT-PCR-based methods have been widely used in COVID-19
diagnosis, their application in accurate diagnosis of viral infection and epidemic control
is severely hampered by their laborious and time-consuming sample processing steps.
Quantitative extraction of nucleic acids with high purity from complex samples are
the prerequisite for efficient RT-PCR assays. Low extraction efficiency might give poor
signals during exponential amplification and thus result in false negative results.11-12
Low extraction quality, on the other hand, may contain a variety of PCR inhibitors,
which gives unreliable readouts during amplification.13-14
In the control and diagnosis towards SARS-CoV-2 currently, silica-based spin column
RNA extraction methods are widely used, in which a silica membrane or glass fiber is
applied to bind nucleic acids. In these traditional methods, the samples need pre-lysis
in an appropriate buffer to release nucleic acids from viral particles before binding to
the column membrane and multiple centrifugation steps are required to enable binding,
washing and elution of extracted nucleic acids. Additionally, as various corrosive
chaotropic salts and toxic organic solvents are involved in the lysis and binding steps,
several sequential washing steps are required to eliminate possible PCR inhibitory
effects in the eluted products. The whole process comprises multiple centrifuging and
column-transferring steps, which is laborious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to
contamination or column clogging. More importantly, spin column-based approaches
are not suitable for a high-throughput, automated operation. In the monitoring and
control of sudden outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, these traditional methods consume
a large number of operators, but giving low diagnosis efficiency and high risk of cross
infection. Thus, fast, convenient and automated nucleic acids extraction methods are
highly desirable not just in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, but also in the
monitoring and prevention of other infectious diseases.
As an alternative, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)-based extraction methods are
centrifuge-free and has proven to be easy to operate and compatible to automation and

high-throughput operation.15-17 In conventional MNPs-based methods, nucleic acids in
the lysed samples can be specifically absorbed on MNPs due to various surfacemodified functional groups. In the presence of magnetic fields, nucleic acids are rapidly
separated from most impurities in the supernatant. After fast washing steps to eliminate
trace impurities, purified nucleic acids can be further released from the surface of MNPs
by elution buffer with altered ionic strength. Although much simpler and faster than
spin column-based methods, most MNPs-based extraction strategies still contain
multiple processing steps such as lysis, binding, washing and elution, which increases
operational difficulties in real clinical diagnosis.
Herein, a further simplified and updated MNPs-based viral RNA extraction method
is described for highly sensitive extraction and RT-PCR detection of viral RNA using
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses as models. The MNPs is synthesized via a simple one-pot
approach, and functionalized with polymers carrying multi-carboxyl groups by
following one-step incubation. Due to the strong interaction between carboxyl groups
and nucleic acids, the poly carboxyl-functionalized MNPs (pcMNPs) enables rapid and
efficient absorption of RNA molecules. In RNA extraction, one lysis/binding step and
one washing step are required for nucleic acids extraction and purification from
complex samples. More importantly, extracted RNA can be directed introduced into
subsequent RT-PCR together with MB without elution step, which dramatically reduce
operating time and risk of contamination. The fast extraction method was verified by
both manual operation and automated system. Due to its simplicity, satisfactory
performances and robustness, this method provides a promising alternative to decrease
the labour-intensity and reduce possibility of false-negative results in current RT-PCRbased SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

(EDTA) and polyethylene glycol 8000 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
USA).
Preparation of amino-modified magnetic nanoparticles (NH2-MNPs)
Bare magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared based on a simple coprecipitation protocol as previously reported.18 Briefly, 3.0 g of Iron (III) chloride
hexahydrate and 2.5 g of Iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate were dissolved separately in
100 mL of deionized water and degassed with nitrogen for 20 min to remove the oxygen
in the solutions. Both iron solutions were then mixed in a 500 mL round-bottom flask,
and 10 mL of ammonium hydroxide was added into the mixture with vigorous stirring
under a nitrogen atmosphere. A rapid change of solution colour was observed from
orange to black, indicating the formation of co-precipitated bare MNPs. The solution
mixture was continuously stirred for another 4 h, and the resulting black products (bare
MNPs) were collected with a magnet and dispersed into ethanol after washing several
times with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, 0.3 g of as-prepared bare MNPs,
15 mL of deionized water and 12 mL of ammonium hydroxide were added into 150 mL
of ethanol, followed by a continuous sonication for 30 min at room temperature. 1.2
mL of TEOS was then added dropwise into the solution mixture after sonication, and
vigorously stirred for another 4 h at room temperature to allow the formation of silica
layers on the surface of MNPs. Afterwards, the silica-coated MNPs were collected with
a magnet and the rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times to remove
residual TEOS. After that, 0.2 g of silica-coated MNPs were dispersed into 50 mL
isopropanol, and 0.2 mL of APTES was dropwise mixed with MNPs solution. The
mixture was incubated under continuous sonication for 6 h at room temperature,
followed by the collection of amino-modified MNPs (NH2-MNPs) with a magnet and
washing with deionized water and ethanol to remove free APTES. The final prepared
NH2-MNPs were preserved in ethanol at 4 oC and the loading of -NH2 group on the
surface was verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (FigureS1A).
Synthesis and characterization of poly (amino ester) with multiple carboxyl
groups (PC)
As shown in Scheme1 A, polymers were prepared based on the protocol reported
previously with minor modification.19 In brief, 3.5 g of 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (17.7
mmol) and 1.5 g of 6-amino caproic acid (11.4 mmol) were firstly mixed in 10 mL of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.961268; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

50% (v/v) DMSO aqueous solution, followed by vigorously stirring for 12 h at 90 °C
in a safe dark place. Subsequently, end-capping reaction was performed by the addition
of 10% (v/v) amino solution, ethylenediamine, into the polymer/DMSO solution. The
as-prepared PC polymers was final preserved at 4 °C with lightproof package. PCs
were further characterized by FTIR spectroscopy (FigureS1B).
Preparation and characterization of PC-coated NH2-MNPs (pcMNPs)
25 mg of NH2-MNPs were dispersed into 25 mL of 50% (v/v) DMSO aqueous
solution and then mixed with 1.25 g of PC under sonication for 10 min. Subsequently,
2.5 mL of NaOH solution (1 M) was introduced to the mixture and sonicated for another
20 min, followed by vigorously shaking for 4 h at 37 °C and rinsing with DMSO and
deionized water for several times. The obtained polymer-coated MNPs (pcMNPs) were
stored in deionized water at 4 °C. The size and morphology of the pcMNPs were
confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Common nucleic acid extraction
The pseudovirus samples were obtained from Zeesan Biotech (Xiamen, China) and
the standard samples were freshly prepared by step-wise dilution of pseudovirus in fetal
calf serum purchased from Thermofisher (Massachusetts, USA) before nucleic acid
extraction experiments. 200 μL of as-prepared standard samples with a known copy
number of viral particles (down to 10 copies) were incubated with 400 μL lysis/binding
buffer (1 M NaI, 2.5 M NaCl, 10% Triton X-100, 40% polyethylene glycol 8000, 25
mM EDTA) and 40 μg pcMNPs for 10 min at room temperature on a rotating shaker.
Then, the pcMNPs-RNA complex was collected magnetically for 1 min and the
supernatant was discarded. Afterwards, the complex was washed once or twice with
400 μL washing buffer (75% ethanol v/v). The purified nucleic acids were released
from MNPs by incubating the complex in 50 μL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0), vortexed at 55 oC bath for 5 min, and 15 μL of supernatant was transferred to
subsequent RT-PCR reaction.
Conventional Real-time reverse-transcription PCR
To quantify the amount of viral RNA captured, Real-time reverse-transcription PCR
using VetMAX™-Plus One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Massachusetts, USA) and Bio-Red PCR
detection system (California, USA) was applied. For conventional RT-PCR, a 30 μL of

reaction solution was set up containing 15 μL of eluted supernatant, 7.5 μL of
4 × reaction buffer, 1.5 μL enzyme mixture, and optimized concentrations of primers
(from 0.25 μM to 1 μM)and probe (from 0.25 μM to 1 μM). Subsequent thermal cycling
was performed at 55°C for 15 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 30 s
and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 35 s. Fluorescence readout were taken
after each cycle, and the threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated by the Bio-Red analysis
system based on plotting against the log10 fluorescence intensity. The oligonucleotide
primers and probes were synthesized by GENEWIZ (Suzhou, China), and
corresponding sequences are shown in Table 1.

Direct RT-PCR ampliﬁcation and detection of the extracted pcMNP-RNA complex
To investigate whether the extracted pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly used
for RT-PCR, an identical extraction was carried out, in which the whole complex was
transferred to the PCR tube without the elution step. Specifically, 30 μL of reaction
solution composed of 15 μL of TE buffer, 7.5 μL of 4 × reaction buffer, 1.5 μL enzyme
mixture, and optimal concentrations of primers (1 μM each) and probe (1 μM) was
mixed with pcMNP-RNA complexes by brief vortexing, and directly transferred to the
PCR tube for RT-PCR using the same procedure as abovementioned.
Development of an automated protocol for RNA extraction
A high throughput automated RNA extraction method was adapted using a
commercial NP968-C automatic nucleic acid extraction system (TIANLONG, Xi'an,
China), which could simultaneously process up to 32 parallel samples in 96-well sample
plates. In detail, 400 μL of lysis/binding buffer, 40 μg pcMNPs and 200 μL of the
sample containing a specific number of pseudovirus particles was sequentially

dispensed into Column 1 of the sample plate. Then the washing buffer and elution buffer
was added separately into Column 2 or 4. Finally, the 96-well sample plate was plugged
onto the matrix and RNA extraction was performed by following an optimized program
(TableS1). Once the program was finished, the 96-well sample plate was removed and
the 15 μL of the eluted product was analysed using the conventional RT-PCR protocol
as described above.
4 Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of pcMNPs
The pcMNPs were prepared by two steps as depicted in Scheme1B. It started with
one-pot synthesis of NH2-MNPs using co-precipitation reaction and hydrolysis of
TEOS/APTES. Once PC polymer was successfully synthesized, its reaction with NH2MNPs would form pcMNPs by the Michael addition to efficiently give pcMNPs. To
investigate the morphology of prepared pcMNPs, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was used and the representative image was shown in Figure1A, suggesting a
spherical morphology of the prepared pcMNPs. In addition, enlarged TEM image of
pcMNPs revealed a thin silica-layer on the particle surfaces with a thickness around 3
nm, implied the successful preparation of silica-coating. By using the dynamic light
scattering technique, it is observed that the prepared pcMNPs have an average diameter
of 10.22 ± 2.8 nm without apparent aggregation (Figure1B). To verify the successful
functionalization of synthesized PC polymers, the average zeta potentials of bare MNPs,
silica-coated MNPs and pcMNPs were measured by DLS. As shown in Fig 1C, the
average zeta potential changed from -4.82 mV ± 0.54 of bare MNPs to 20.57 mV ± 0.71
of silica-coated MNPs due to the NH2- groups introduced during silica-coating.
However, functionalization of PC polymers resulted in a decrease of average zeta
potential of pcMNPs to -38.67 mV ± 0.84, indicating successful polymer coating and
more importantly, good dispersion of pcMNPs in the solution. Subsequently, the
magnetic response property of bare MNPs, NH2-MNPs and pcMNPs were tested
(Figure1D). The magnetically capture process was completely finished within 30 s,
implying excellent paramagnetic property of the prepared pcMNPs.

RNA binding property of pxMNPs
To investigate the RNA binding property of prepared pxMNPs, RNA binding assays
were performed by incubating 2 μg RNA molecules with 20 μg pcMNPs in 200 μL
lysis/binding buffer. As shown in Figure2A, more than 90% of RNA was absorbed by
the pcMNPs within 10 min. In contrast, significant amount RNA molecules have been
observed using a commercialized RNA extraction kit under similar conditions. More
importantly, no aggregation has been observed when incubating pxMNPs in a high-salt
solution (50 mM NaCl), further confirmed their excellent dispersity (Figure2B).

Optimization of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA extraction and amplification

Scheme2 A schematic representation of the pcMNP-based viral RNA extraction
method.
By following a simple lysis/binding-washing-elution protocol shown in Scheme2, 105
copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in 200 μL serum samples were extracted and
subject to RT-PCR analysis. We first carried out a concentration optimization of the
primer and probe to maximize the efﬁciency and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection.
The results showed that the optimal concentrations were 1 μM and 1 μM for the primer

pairs and probes respectively (FigureS2).

Subsequently, the optimal amount of

pcMNPs in viral RNA extraction were evaluated. Considering the high viral load in
clinical samples, although 20 μg of pcMNPs were enough to extract 105 copies of
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus RNA in 200 μL serum samples (FigureS3), 40 μg pcMNPs
was used in subsequent experiments.

Figure3 RT-PCR assays towards viral RNA extracted by different pcMNPs-based
methods. RT-PCR assays amplifying (A) the ORF1ab region and (B) the N gene in
pseudoviral RNA extracted by a manual protocol.
Due to the excellent water dispersity of pcMNPs, we hypothesized that they can stay
dispersed in the first few cycles of RT-PCR reaction, without shielding the extracted
RNA molecules in aggregates from primer binding and elongation. Thus, by following
the optimized conditions, performances of the pcMNPs-based RNA extraction and
Direct RT-PCR was investigated. 105 copies of pseudoviruses were spiked into 200 μL
of serum and the extracted viral RNA were analysed by RT-PCR using eluted products
(Conventional RT-PCR) or pcMNPs-RNA complexes without elution (Direct RT-PCR).
In these experiments, the serum sample without pseudoviruses was used as a negative
control, while the PCR reaction mixture directly spiked with 105 copies of
pseudoviruses was regarded as a positive control. As shown in Figure3A, in the
detection of ORFlab (Open Reading Frame 1ab) region, the direct RT-PCR without
elution step exhibited a slightly smaller cycle threshold (Ct) value than that measured
using Conventional RT-PCR after elution. This is possibly because all extracted viral
RNA was introduced to the amplification in the Direct RT-PCR, while only half of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.961268; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this

eluted products was added for the Conventional RT-PCR. This phenomenon suggests
that one advantages of the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol is to reduce possible
false negative results, since all extracted viral RNA has been directed to the subsequent
amplification without potential lost in the elution and transfer steps. Additionally, there
is no detectable differences between amplification efficiencies of the positive control
and Direct RT-PCR (Figure3A red and purple lines). This result suggests that our
pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction protocol not only exhibits nearly 100% RNA
extraction efficiency in serum samples, but also provides high-purity products without
PCR inhibitors.
Automated viral RNA extraction based on pcMNPs
As previously described, one of the most serious disadvantages of traditional columnbased extraction approaches is the difficulties in automation. Because no centrifugation
steps are required, MNPs-based methods allow fully automated nucleic acid
purification, which is highly important in current SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Therefore,
the feasibility of automating viral RNA extraction procedure based on our pcMNPs was
subsequently evaluated. A commercialized magnetic rods-based nucleic acid
purification system was used. An automated programme was set according to the
manual protocol (Figure4A). During the extraction process, although the shaking
pattern of magnetic rods was set at the most vigorous level, no breakage or leakage of
pcMNPs were observed, since the eluted solution are colourless and transparent
(FigureS4). As shown in Figure4B, the amplification curve of the automated sample is
very close to that of the positive control and manually performed Direct RT-PCR
samples, which suggests that our pcMNPs-based method is highly suitable for the
automated high throughput viral RNA extraction.

RT-PCR assays amplifying the N gene in pseudoviral RNA following the Conventional
RT-PCR protocol, and (B) corresponding calibration curve. The red line is the linear
regression fit (R2 = 0.999). (C) RT-PCR assays amplifying the N gene in pseudoviral

The red line is the linear regression fit (R2 = 0.998).

Then, the sensitivity and dynamic range of pcMNPs-based viral RNA detection
method was evaluated and compared by following the Conventional and Direct RTPCR protocols, using N gene carrying pseudovirus as a model. A series of standard
samples containing 105 to 10 copies of pseudovirus were freshly prepared by step-wise
10-fold dilution of in serum. A control serum sample (no pseudovirus) was also
included as a negative control to monitor the presence of false positive signals. As
shown in Figure 5A, a detection limit of 10 copies of pseudovirus was achieved using
Convectional RT-PCR protocol. A strong linear relationship between the logarithm of
pseudovirus particle numbers and the corresponding Ct values was found crossing over
5 orders of magnitude ranging from 10 to 105 copies with a high correlation coefficient
(R2 = 0.999) (Figure5B). Parallelly, similar detection limit and linear relationship were
observed in experiments following the pcMNPs-based Direct RT-PCR protocol

(Figure5C and D). Meanwhile, the differences of Ct values between neighbouring
curves are approximately 3 cycles, which is very close to the theoretical 3.3 cycles for
a 10-fold dilution. These results indicated that the RT-PCR amplification is highly
efficient both in the presence or absence of pcMNPs. However, it is also important to
note that in both cases, the negative controls sometimes gave observable amplification
signals. Although their Ct values are lagged too far behind 40 cycles to be regarded as
a valid positive result, this phenomenon raise concerns about possible false-positive
issues, in which further optimization of primer pairs and probe might be necessary.
Overall, the updated MB-based extraction method had highly extraction eﬃciency
and compatibility of PCR ampliﬁcation in any of the patterns, which dramatically
simplified laborious sample processing work and was ideally suitable for RT-PCR assay
of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 10 copies at least.

Efficient and robust nucleic acids extraction from complex clinical samples is the ﬁrst
and the most important step for subsequent molecular diagnosis, but currently it is still
highly labour intensive and time-consuming. For example, although the genome

sequences of SARS-CoV2 have been fully revealed and various RT-PCR-based
detection kits have been developed, timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is still highly
challenging partially due to the lack of satisfactory viral RNA extraction strategy. In
this study, a carboxyl polymer-coated MNPs, namely pcMNPs, was developed and a
simple but efficient viral RNA extraction system was established for sensitive detection
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via RT-PCR. As compared with traditional column-based nucleic
acids extraction methods, our pcMNPs-based method has several advantages (Table 2).
Firstly, pcMNPs-based method combines the virus lysis and RNA binding steps into
one, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RTPCR reactions (Direct RT-PCR), which gives a dramatically simplified RNA extraction
protocol. Secondly, pcMNPs have excellent viral RNA binding performances, which
results in 10-copy sensitivity and the high linearity over 5 logs of gradient in SARSCoV-2 viral RNA detection using RT-PCR. Thirdly, this method can be easily adopted
in fully automated nucleic acid extraction systems without laborious optimization.
Furthermore, the pcMNPs-RNA complexes obtained by this method is also compatible
with various isothermal amplification methods, such as RPA and LAMP, and thus could
be used in the development of POCT devices. In conclusion, due to its simplicity,
robustness, and excellent performances, our pcMNPs-based method may provide a
promising alternative to solve the laborious and time-consuming viral RNA extraction
operations, and thus exhibits a great potential in the high throughput SARS-CoV-2
molecular diagnosis.
