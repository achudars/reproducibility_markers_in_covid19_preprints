Abstract: The understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the fitness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its mutational
evolution is still a critical issue. We built a simplified computational model, called SpikePro, to predict the SARS-CoV-2 fitness
from the amino acid sequence and structure of the spike protein. It contains three contributions: the viral transmissibility
predicted from the stability of the spike protein, the infectivity computed in terms of the affinity of the spike protein for the
ACE2 receptor, and the ability of the virus to escape from the human immune response based on the binding affinity of the spike
protein for a set of neutralizing antibodies. Our model reproduces well the available experimental, epidemiological and clinical
data on the impact of variants on the biophysical characteristics of the virus. For example, it is able to identify circulating viral
strains that, by increasing their fitness, recently became dominant at the population level. SpikePro is a useful instrument for
the genomic surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, since it predicts in a fast and accurate way the emergence of new viral strains
and their dangerousness. It is freely available in the GitHub repository github.com/3BioCompBio/SpikeProSARS-CoV-2.

Despite mitigation measures put in place around the world to slow down the fast spreading of the SARS-CoV2 virus, the CoViD-19 viral pandemic continues to have global devastating effects, with more than 130,000,000
people infected and almost 3,000,000 deaths [1]. Lots of efforts and resources have been devoted in the last year to
develop vaccines and new therapeutics in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection [2,3]. Several vaccines such as
mRNA-1273 [4], BNT162b2 [5], AZD1222 [6], Sputnik V [7], Ad26 [8] and NVX-CoV2373 [9] have proven to be safe
and efficacious against the viral agent and have recently been approved by the regulatory agencies for emergency
use. Thanks to these developments, large-scale vaccine administration is now ongoing throughout the world.
Moreover, while the pathogenic mechanisms of the viral infection are still unclear, effective therapeutic agents
have been developed. For example, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the viral spike protein or human
convalescent plasma have been employed in clinical practice by passively transferring them to patients [10–13].
This therapy generally leads to an improvement of the disease conditions and to a reduction of viral load.
The increase in viral immunity at the population level due to infection, vaccination or passive immunization
via nAbs clearly results in a stronger selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus [14,15]. This causes the emergence
of new variants of the virus which are able to escape from the immune response. Lots of computational and
experimental studies are currently focusing on the understanding of these escape mechanisms in the SARS-CoV-2
viral infection [16–20] and on setting up SARS-CoV-2 immune surveillance of the world’s population to track and
eventually limit the spreading of potentially escaping variants [21–26].
However, the prediction of how SARS-CoV-2 evolves under this selective pressure is far from obvious.
Indeed, even though SARS-CoV-2 has a moderate mutation rate compared to other RNA viruses due to its more
accurate replication [27], tracking viral dynamics in the huge space of possible variant combinations (including also
deletions and insertions) under the influence of human immunity makes predictions highly challenging. Extensive
large-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and host immunity will help to better understand these issues
[27].
In this paper, we performed an extensive computational analysis of the mutational mechanisms that lead
to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 strains with increased fitness, with the aim to better understand the molecular
mechanisms that drive viral adaptation and escape from the human immune system. We performed in silico

mutagenesis experiments and predicted the impacts of mutations in the spike protein on its stability and on its
affinity for nAbs and for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), known to be the SARS-CoV-2 entry point
into the cell. We validated these predictions on viral variants for which experimental, epidemiological or clinical
data has been obtained, and especially on the variants that are emerging and rapidly spreading to become prevalent
genotypes. Our predictions are of utmost importance to help monitoring the future evolutionary dynamics of
SARS-CoV-2 and to identify the emergent strains whose spread will have to be limited via either the design of new
vaccines or new mitigation measures.
2. Methods
2.1. Spike protein structures
The spike protein or S-protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Uniprot code P0DTC2) is a homotrimeric glycoprotein
attached to the viral membrane. It can adopt two forms, a closed and an open form. The transition between these
forms increases the solvent exposure of the protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), which encompasses residues
333-526 and mediates the fusion of the membranes of the virus and its host.
The 3-dimensional (3D) structures of the two forms have been experimentally resolved by cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and are deposited in the Protein DataBank (PDB) [28]. The closed form, with PDB code
6VXX, has a resolution of 2.80 Å [29], and the open form, 6VYB, has a resolution of 3.20 Å. These structures
have thus quite a low resolution and do not contain all the residues of the spike protein. To get structures of the
closed and open forms without missing residues, we modelled the complete amino acid sequence using the PDB
structures 6VXX and 6YVB as templates and the homology modelling webserver SWISS-MODEL [30].
More accurate structures, resolved by X-ray crystallography, are available for the RBD of the spike protein.
We used the PDB structure 6M0J [31] for this region, which contains the RBD bound to ACE2, with a resolution of
2.45 Å.
Furthermore, we set up a dataset of spike protein/nAb complexes taken from [32], referred to as D nAb . We
used the following selection criteria:
•
•
•

Human monoclonal nAbs generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection;
nAbs targeting the spike protein;
nAbs/spike protein complexes available in the PDB, with X-ray structure of resolution  3.2 Å.

69

D nAb contains 31 structures of nAbs/spike protein complexes, listed in the GitHub repository github.com/3BioCompBio/Sp
CoV-2. These nAbs exclusively target the RBD of the spike protein, and are assumed to mimic the diversity of the
human immune B-cell repertoire.

2.2. Spike protein stability

77

To compute the change in folding free energy upon point mutations in the spike protein, we used the
PoPMuSiC algorithm [33], which is based on the 3D structure of the target protein and a combination of statistical
mean-force potentials. We applied it to the modelled structures of the open and closed forms of the spike protein,
and to the experimental structure of the RBD domain. The final value of the change in folding free energy caused
by a mutation i, DDGiS , was defined as follows: for mutations of residues in the RBD, we considered the predictions
based on the 6M0J structure of the RBD; for mutations of other residues, we averaged the predicted energy values
obtained from the two models obtained from the low-resolution structures 6VYB and 6VXX.

For the changes in binding affinity upon single-site mutations, we used the BeAtMuSiC predictor [34], which
is a linear combination of free energy values predicted by PoPMuSiC on the protein complex and on the separate
partners. We applied BeAtMuSiC to predict the effect of variants in the viral spike protein on its binding affinity for
the ACE2 receptor of the host, which allows entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. For this purpose, we considered
the X-ray structure 6M0J of the RBD/ACE2 receptor complex [31] as input, and computed the change in binding
free energy DDGiACE2 of the RBD/ACE2 complex upon mutations i in the RBD. Mutations in the spike protein but
outside of RBD were assumed to have no effect on ACE2 binding.

Viral fitness is related to how efficiently the virus produces infectious progeny [35]. It is a fairly complex
function of different characteristics among which the transmissibility of the virus, its infectivity and its ability to
escape from the host’s immune response. We estimated the fitness Fi of a variant i of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on
the basis of a simplified model which only takes into account the spike protein. More precisely, we defined it as a
product of three fitness contributions:
Fi = fiS ⇥ fiACE2 ⇥ finAb

where fS , fACE2 and fnAb represent the relative propensities of the mutant virus to be transmitted, to infect the host,
and to escape the host’s immune system. These propensities are assumed to be higher for spike protein variants
that are stabler [36] (DDGS < 0), that have greater binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor [37] (DDGACE2 < 0), and
nAb

that have lower binding affinity for nAbs (DDG
> 0), respectively. We thus defined the fitness contributions fiS
and fiACE2 of a mutation i to be a positive decreasing function of DDGiS and DDGiACE2 , respectively, and finAb i a

Mutations i that strongly destabilize the spike protein (DDGiS
0 kcal/mol) or its binding to ACE2
(DDGiACE2
0 kcal/mol), or that stabilize its binding with nAbs (DDGinAb ⌧ 0 kcal/mol) have a fitness
close to zero.
Mutations that stabilize the spike protein (DDGiS < 0 kcal/mol) or its binding to ACE2 (DDGiACE2 <
0 kcal/mol), or that destabilize binding to nAbs (DDGinAb > 0 kcal/mol) have an evolutionary advantage
and a fitness higher than one.
To avoid excessively high fitness values, we cut the exponential growth of the f-functions for DDGi = b, with
b = bS = bACE = bnAb chosen to be 1, similarly to what has been proposed in [38].
The folding free energy changes predicted by PoPMuSiC have been shown to be biased towards destabilizing
mutations [39,40]. To correct for this effect, the µS parameter has been chosen to be equal to 0.5. The changes in
binding free energy predicted by BeAtMuSiC have an analogous bias, as they are constructed from PoPMuSiC
scores. Following the BeAtMuSiC construction detailed in [34], a bias in the PoPMuSiC energy value of 0.5
results in a bias in the BeatMuSiC energy value of 0.19. We thus fixed µS = 0.50 and µACE = µnAb = 0.19.
We set by definition the fitness value of the wild-type equal to one: f0S = f0ACE2 = f0nAb = 1.

The global viral fitness, which takes into account multiple mutations in the spike protein, is defined as the
product of the fitness values of all point mutations i as:

3. Results
3.1. Computational pipeline
In its viral evolution, SARS-CoV-2 and our immune system are constantly engaged in what is known as a
cat-and-mouse game, where SARS-CoV-2 attempts to increase its fitness by increasing its transmissibility, infectivity
and/or to escape from the human immune response. To quantitatively describe the viral fitness landscape, we
developed a simplified model in which we focused on the spike protein. This protein, which protrudes from the
virus surface, is a crucial component of the infection, as its binding to the ACE2 receptor of the host mediates the
virus entry into the cells. The binding affinity of the spike protein for ACE2 has thus been related to SARS-CoV-2
infectivity [37]. The stability properties of the spike protein itself are another key element in the viral infection
which has been related to the viral transmissibility [36].
Moreover, the spike protein is a major inducer of the host’s immune response [18,26]. We mimicked the effect
of the immune system on the SARS-COV-2 virus through a set of 31 nAb/spike protein complexes contained in
the dataset D nAb (see Section 2.1). We observed that these nAbs target exclusively the RBD of the spike protein
and that the epitopes cover almost the entire RBD surface, as shown in Fig. 1. A recent investigation suggests
that RBD-binding antibodies are the major contributors of the neutralizing activity in convalescent human plasma
[18,26]. This justifies our approximation of considering the nAbs of the set D nAb as representative of the immune
response.

Figure 1. Receptor binding domain of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein. The ensemble of epitope residues targeted by at least one
of the nAbs of the set D nAb are in light pink spheres, and the other, non-epitope, residues are in blue spheres. The two views
are related by a 180o rotation with respect to the plane representing the ACE2 binding interface.

To estimate the global viral fitness F of spike protein variants in terms of transmissibility, infectivity and
escape from the host’s immune response, we computed it, using physics-based approaches, as a product of three
fitness contributions, related to the change in stability of the spike protein upon amino acid substitution (fS ), and
to its change in binding affinity for ACE2 (fACE2 ) and for neutralizing antibodies (fnAb ), respectively, as defined in
Eqs (1)-(3). The effect on fitness of multiple mutations are considered as independent and thus simply multiplied
(Eq. 4). The fitness contributions are in turn expressed in terms of the change upon mutation of the folding free
energy of the spike protein (DDGS ) and of its binding affinity for ACE2 (DDGACE2 ) and for nAbs (DDGnAb ), using
the PoPMuSiC [33] and BeAtMuSiC [34] algorithms (see Sections 2.2-2.4).
In order to identify mutations in the spike protein that increase or decrease the SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility
or infectivity, or that facilitate or block the escape from the protective immunity elicited by the infection, we constructed a computational pipeline of three steps, schematically represented in Fig. 2, in which we estimated DDGS

stability, with DDGiS between -1 and 0 kcal/mol. A smaller number of dominant variants have their stability
slightly decreased with DDGiS between 0 and 1 kcal/mol. Outside of this free energy interval, the rate Ri is almost
vanishing.
Moreover, we found a very good agreement between the predicted fitness fiS and the Ri rate, as seen in Fig.
3.b. Indeed, variants that are predicted to be fitter than the wild type protein, and especially the variants i with
fiS > 2, have a high Ri rate, which means that they circulate a lot and got fixed during viral evolution. We will
deepen this point in Sections 3.6-3.7.
It is important to underline that we did not fit any parameters of our model on the SARS-CoV-2 data. Thus,
this prediction as well as all the predictions presented in the following sections are truly blind predictions.

Figure 3. Mutation rate Ri of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants i observed in the GISAID database [42] as a function of (a) the
predicted change in folding free energy DDGiS (in kcal/mol) and (b) the predicted fitness contribution fiS .

192

Finally, it is also instructive to analyze the localization of the variants fixed through viral evolution in the 3D
structure of the spike protein. The mean values of Ri in the core (solvent accessibility <20%), in partially buried
regions (20%-50%) and at the surface (>50%) are equal to 0.06, 0.06 and 0.23, respectively. This indicates that
variants that got fixed are mainly situated in solvent-exposed regions, where they can play a key role in modulating
binding with other biomolecules. Variants in buried or partially buried regions are less often observed, as these
areas are more constrained from a structural point of view and are usually not involved in function.

We analyzed here the impact of variants on the binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor. For
all possible point substitutions i in the spike protein, we computed the change in binding affinity of the spike
protein/ACE2 complex, DDGiACE2 , using the BeAtMuSiC program [34]. Based on the DDGiACE2 values, we
estimated the fiACE2 viral fitness, aimed at modeling infectivity. Indeed, a higher binding affinity between the
spike protein and ACE2 results in a higher efficiency of virus entry into the host’s cells [37], which in turn leads to
an increase of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.
We compared the predicted binding free energy values DDGiACE2 with the experimentally characterized
binding properties of thousands of variants introduced in the RBD of the spike protein using a yeast surface
display platform, in which binding to ACE2 were quantitatively determined via flow cytometry [41]. Such deep
mutagenesis scanning techniques are excellent tools to estimate biophysical quantities on a large scale. However,
even though the average accuracy is reasonably good, the measured quantities are often noisy [43].
A good agreement was found between the computed DDGiACE2 values and the large-scale measured binding
affinity properties, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.46. This result is very good, especially as not only
the computed but also the experimental values have limited accuracy. It clearly underlines the quality of our
prediction approach.

Immune evasion is the well-known mechanism used by viruses to evade from the immune system of its host,
thus making its replication and spreading more efficient [44]. This mechanism involves a series of strategies such
as spontaneous mutations that result in the inactivation of nAbs [45] or in the inhibition of pattern-recognition
receptors initiating signalling pathways [46].

To represent the diversity of the B-cell receptor repertoire and to mimic the effect of the human immune
response, we considered the set D nAb of more than 30 nAbs, of which the 3D structures with the RBD of the spike
protein have been experimentally resolved (see Section 2.1). We performed a large-scale in silico mutagenesis
experiment by introducing all possible point mutations i in the RBD of the spike protein and by computing with
nAbs

BeAtMuSiC [34] the resulting change in binding free energy DDGi
averaged over of all spike protein/nAb
complexes that contain the mutation, as well as their associated fitness contribution finAb (see Eqs (2)-(4)). With
this procedure, we identified key spike protein variants that are likely to either help or destroy the neutralization
activity of the nAbs.
In a first stage, we performed validation tests on BeAtMuSiC’s DDGinAb predictions. We compared them with
deep mutagenesis scanning data measuring the impact of mutations in the RBD on their escape fractions from two
nAbs, REGN10933 and REGN10987, which are often administrated as a cocktail to COVID-19 patients [47]. The
escape fractions were estimated using a high-throughput yeast-surface-display platform, in which folded RBDs
were expressed on the yeast cell surface and the fraction of cells that express mutant RBDs and that are bound to
nAbs was measured [19]. Per-mutant escape fraction values close to zero indicate that the variant is bound to nAbs
while values close to one indicate that it is not.
The structures of the complexes formed by the spike protein and REGN10933 or REGN10987 nAbs have
recently been resolved (PDB code 6XDG). They target two different structural epitopes in the RBD of the spike
protein. We did not include these structures in our set D nAb as they have been resolved via cryo-EM technique
at only 3.9 Å of resolution. We predicted the changes in binding affinity DDGi of the two spike protein/nAb
complexes caused by all RBD mutations i for which experimental escape fractions were available. Despite the low
resolution of the 3D structures, we found very good Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.48 and 0.43 between the
per-mutant escape fractions and the computed changes in affinity DDGi for REGN10933 and REGN10987 nAbs,
respectively.
In a second stage, we estimated the fitness contributions finAb of all possible mutations i in the spike protein’s
RBD on the basis of the predicted changes in binding free energy for the set of 31 good-resolution nAbs/spike
protein complexes collected in D nAb . We made here and in what follows the strong approximation that these 31
nAbs represent the diversity of the human nAb repertoire. To validate this model, we compared the estimated
fitness contributions finAb with a series of data obtained from in vivo experiments aimed to study the viral escape
from nAbs.
We started by considering the set of 22 variants of the spike protein for which the neutralizing activity of
six nAbs has been experimentally tested in terms of the relative degree of resistance (in %) of the growth of each
mutant virus in the presence or in the absence of each of these nAbs [48]; we considered the average percentage
over the six nAbs tested. Low percentages identify variants that escape much more from nAbs than the wild
type virus and high percentages, variants that only weakly affect the wild-type spike protein/nAbs affinity. We
predicted correctly 18 out of the 22 variants as having fnAb fitness values greater than one; the last four variants
have fnAb ⇠ 0.9. Detailed results are reported in Table 1 for the five variants shown to have the broadest in vitro
neutralizing spectrum [48]. Our results reproduce quite well the in vitro trends: variants that are likely to escape
from at least some nAbs tend to have fitness values larger than one. Note, moreover, that the antibodies tested in
[48] are different from the nAbs of our D nAb set. Because of that, we did not expect such a good match between the
experiments and our predictions. This result indicates that the set D nAb is truly representative of the antibody
repertoire neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The response to the viral infection drastically depends on the ensemble of nAbs present in the host, given that
each nAb behaves differently with respect to wild-type and variant strains. In agreement with this, the predicted

We also validated our fitness predictions fnAb against the large-scale experimental estimation of the immune
escape fractions of about 2,000 variants, averaged over a set of 17 nAbs [49]; these nAbs are not in the set D nAb .
We found a reasonably good overall Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.29 between fnAb and measured escape
fractions. Looking at more detail, the residues whose mutations most affect nAb binding belong to two regions of
the RBD: the 443–450 and 484-490 loops that are situated at both sides of the ACE2 binding interface [49]. Using
our set D nAb of nAbs, we predicted the second region as potentially leading to immune escape with a fnAb value
of 1.6. The nAb escaping capability is predicted to be weaker for the first region, with fnAb = 1.1.
A 3D representation of the per-residue fitness contributions finAb in the RBD of the spike protein, averaged
over all possible mutations at each position, is shown in Fig. 5. This figure is very useful to identify residues whose
mutation is likely to lead to the escape from the D nAb set of nAbs.

Figure 5. Average per-residue fnAb values mapped onto the 3D structure of the RBD of the spike protein (PDB code 6M0J). The
residues whose mutations are likely to lead to the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from the nAbs are shown in white and the others in
blue. The two views are related by a 180o rotation with respect to the plane representing the ACE2 binding interface.

3.5. Immune escape from polyclonal human sera

291

We examined to what extent our method reproduces the impact of variants on the neutralizing activity of
polyclonal human sera. Note that such activity depends on a wide range of factors among which inter-patient
variability and time since infection [49]. Our computational approach is obviously unable to capture all intricate
dependencies but rather, we expect it to detect general trends.
We used deep mutagenesis scanning data from [49], in which the escape fractions of about 2,000 single-site
RBD variants were assessed on the neutralizing activity of plasma samples taken from 17 SARS-CoV-2-infected
individuals, at different time points after infection. We calculated the correlation between the escape fraction for
each variant averaged over the patients and post-infection time points and the predicted fitness contributions
fnAb computed from the D nAb set of nAbs. We obtained a reasonably good Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.35
between the predicted and measured quantities.
Only few residues appear to contribute substantially to the escape mechanisms, when averaged over the
whole plasma sample collection. Indeed, only 23 residues have an average escape fraction greater than 3%. Our
predictions for these residues are in very good agreement with experiments: we obtained an average per-residue
fnAb equal to 1.5. Residue F456 shows almost perfect agreement: it has the highest measured escape fraction, and
also has the highest predicted fnAb value, equal to 2.2. Almost all substitutions at that position are predicted to
strongly impact on the binding in the majority of spike-protein/nAbs complexes analyzed.
Finally, it is interesting to compare the measured immune escaping fractions in polyclonal plasma discussed in
this section with the experimentally characterized escape fractions in the set of nAbs studied in [49] and discussed
in Section 3.4. We found that their linear correlation coefficient is equal to 0.4, which indicates there are differences
between the tested cocktail of nAbs and serum plasma. Possible explanations include the scarcity of the tested
antibodies in the polyclonal plasma, or the subdominance of the epitopes they target [49].

We focused on five SARS-CoV-2 variants most frequently observed worldwide, as reported in the GISAID
database [42] in March 2021, and predicted their fitness; the results are shown in Table 2.
The most frequently observed spike protein variant involves the substitution of aspartic acid at position 614
into glycine, situated outside the RBD. This variant quickly became dominant after its appearance in early 2020
[36,50]. We correctly predicted a substantial increase of fitness for this variant with respect to wild type, which is
S
driven by an increased stability of the spike protein (fD614G
= 3.7). We hypothesize that this stabilization leads to
a higher person-to-person viral transmissibility, as also suggested in [36,50,51] and observed in vivo [51]. In the
latter study, a stabilization of the spike protein was measured upon D614G substitution via a strengthening of the
S1-S2 subunit interactions, where S1 is the receptor binding subunit containing the RBD and S2 is the membrane
fusion subunit. In contrast, this variant was shown to alter neither the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 nor the
antibody neutralization, as it is situated outside the RBD [51]. We also correctly reproduced this result, with fitness
ACE2 = 1.0 = fnAb (Table 2). The overall predicted fitness is thus F
values of fD614G
D614G = 3.7.
D614G
Two other variants, A222V and P681H, show similar albeit less pronounced trends. Our results predict an
S
increase in transmissibility (fSA222V ⇡ fP681H
⇡ 2.0), but to a lesser extent than D614G. Experimental data are in
agreement with the weaker impacts of these variants on the spike protein fitness and the viral transmissibility
compared to D614G [52,53]. The A222V variant has been related to the large outbreaks in Europe in early summer
2020, while P681H is associated to the so-called UK lineage (B.1.1.7) that appeared in UK in late 2020 and is now
becoming dominant in Europe in the current outbreaks.
Finally, N501Y is also a widely spread variant appearing in all major lineages, i.e. UK (B.1.1.7), Brazilian
(P.1) and South African (B.1.351) lineages. We predicted this variant as having a high overall fitness F due to a
nAb
combination of increased fitness contributions fSN501Y and fACE2
N501Y , but a f N501Y =1. In other words, we predicted
this variant to be more transmissible and infectious than the wild type but to have no impact on the response of
the human immune system. More precisely, we predicted N501Y as improving the stability of the spike protein
RBD and its binding affinity for ACE2; the latter property is also suggested by another computational study [54].
No clinical data suggest that N501Y is able to escape from the immune post-vaccination response [55], which tends
to support our prediction results.

December 2019 till March 2021, which amounts to about 7.8 ⇥105 strains. We subdivided the strains according
to the month of collection and computed the per-month average of viral fitness. The results are reported in Fig.
6.a as a function of time. Clearly, we predict an increase of the viral fitness since the beginning of the infection in
December 2019, in agreement with epidemiological results. This result once again demonstrates the quality of our
computational pipeline.
Note that to predict the future evolution of the fitness F, it is necessary to take into account different parameters
such as the varying repertoire of human nAbs and the effect of vaccination. While the fitness contributions fS
and fACE2 are expected to reach a plateau when the spike protein sequence becomes optimal for stability and for
binding to ACE2, the cat-and-mouse game played by the virus and its host leads the host to continuously adapt its
B-cell repertoire to the new variants of the virus, so that fnAb certainly increases with respect to the old nAbs, but
not with respect to the new nAbs. In total, the overall fitness F is expected to plateau after some time, or at least
increase less.
We analyzed in more detail the evolution of the partial distribution function of the per-month averaged fitness
in Fig. 6.b. In January 2020, the population was dominated by the wild type strain whose fitness F is by definition
equal to one. The effect of the D614G spike protein variant with a predicted F ⇠ 4 is observed from May 2020,
while in October of the same year, additional mutations with F = 2.0, such as A222V, started to be fixed in the
population, leading to a further increase of F. In March 2021, the distribution became dominated by new variants,
i.e. UK, South-African and Brazilian variants, with a much higher fitness than both the wild-type and D614G
strains.
Finally, we carefully checked that our large-scale mutagenesis predictions are not biased towards high fitness
values. Indeed, such bias could potentially cause a trivial increase in fitness upon evolution and lead to erroneous
interpretations. To verify this, we created 2 ⇥ 106 viral strains by inserting either three or five random mutations in
the wild-type spike protein and assumed that they got fixed with probability one independently of their fitness
value; the number of random mutations was chosen based on the average number of single variants per strain
in the GISAID database which is between three and four. We then computed the fitness F for all these random
variant strains. On the other hand, we plotted the F distribution of the real variant strains observed in the GISAID
database. The fitness distribution of the two simulated and the real viral strains are completely different, as shown
in Fig. 7. When three or five random mutations are inserted in the spike protein, the F distributions have a median
value of 0.32 and 0.12, respectively; moreover, 79% and 86% of the mutated strains have a lower overall fitness F
than the wild-type virus. In contrast, the distribution of real strains has a median of 4.8 and basically all the strains
(99.5%) have a predicted fitness higher than the wild type. This analysis further supports the unbiased nature and
validity of our computational approach.

Here we set up and validated SpikePro, a simple computational model that predicts the impact of spike
protein variants on the SARS-CoV-2 fitness and more specifically, on viral transmissibility, infectivity and ability of
escaping from the host’s immune system. Moreover, the program is easy to use and can be freely downloaded
from github.com/3BioCompBio/SpikeProSARS-CoV-2. SpikePro allows identifying, with good accuracy and in a
few seconds, new SARS-CoV-2 variants with high fitness which need to be closely monitored by health agencies. It
has thus a central role to play in the genomic surveillance programs of the new SARS-CoV-2 strains, especially in
the coming future with the growing number of people vaccinated and thus the larger selective pressure on the
virus [56].

Despite the progress we made towards a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
the SARS-CoV-2 fitness, we made some approximations in the construction of our model which we will try to
relax in future studies. For example, we did not take into account possible amino acid deletions or insertions
in the spike protein, although they certainly influence the viral fitness. It would also be interesting to take into
account epistatic effects. Indeed, while more and more variants get fixed, interactions between them are expected
to become non-negligible. Furthermore, the model should be extended to other proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
such as the non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) which also contributes to immune evasion [57], rather than considering
the spike protein only. Finally, when more nAbs/spike protein complexes will be resolved at high resolution, they
will enrich our set D nAb and better describe the B-cell receptor repertoire. Considering a weighted combination of
the effects of RBD variants on all nAbs depending on different factors such as time and vaccination status would
further improve our method in mimicking the immune response and its temporal evolution.
