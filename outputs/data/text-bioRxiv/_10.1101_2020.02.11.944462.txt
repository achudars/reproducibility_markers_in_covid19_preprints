Abstract

2

The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCov) represents a pandemic threat that has been

3

declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a

4

key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate

5

medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM

6

structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the

7

trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible

8

conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds

9

ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-

10

CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to

11

nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs.

12

The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation

13

of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.

14

The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged as a human pathogen in the city

15

of Wuhan in China’s Hubei province, causing fever, severe respiratory illness and pneumonia (1,

16

2). According to the World Health Organization on February 10th, 2020, there have been over

17

40,000 confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 900 deaths. The new pathogen was rapidly

18

shown to be a novel member of the betacoronavirus genus that is closely related to several bat

19

coronaviruses as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4).

20

Compared to SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to be more readily transmitted from human-to-

21

human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health

22

Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (1, 5, 6).

23

2019-nCoV makes use of a densely glycosylated, homotrimeric class I fusion spike (S)

24

protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein exists in a metastable prefusion conformation

25

that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell

26

membrane (7, 8). This process is triggered by binding of the S1 subunit to a host-cell receptor,

27

which destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of

28

the S2 subunit to a highly stable postfusion conformation (9). In order to engage a host-cell

29

receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational

30

movements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding. These two states

31

are referred to as the “down” conformation and the “up” conformation, where “down”

32

corresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and “up” corresponds to the receptor-accessible

33

state, which is thought to be less stable (10-13). Due to the indispensable function of the S

34

protein it represents a vulnerable target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and

35

characterization of the prefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guide

36

vaccine design and development.

37

Based on the reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV(4), we expressed ectodomain

38

residues 1−1208 of 2019-nCoV S (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure 1), adding two stabilizing

39

proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery based on a previous stabilization

40

strategy which proved highly effective for betacoronavirus S proteins (11, 14). We obtained

41

roughly 0.5 mg/L of the recombinant prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain from FreeStyle 293

42

cells, and the protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion

43

chromatography (Supplementary Figure 1). Cryo-EM grids were prepared using this purified,

44

fully glycosylated S protein and preliminary screening revealed a high particle density with little

45

aggregation near the edges of the holes.

46

After collecting and processing 3,207 micrograph movies, we obtained a 3.5 Å-resolution

47

3D reconstruction of an asymmetrical trimer in which a single RBD was observed in the “up”

48

conformation. (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 2). Due to the small size of the RBD (~21

49

kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3D

50

reconstruction and 3D classification were performed (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 3). By

51

using the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we were able to observe breathing of the

52

S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to the

53

relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared to the more stable S2 subunit (Supplementary

54

Movies 1 and 2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structural

55

characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as

56

the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)(10, 11, 13,

57

16). The observation of this phenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same

58

mechanism of triggering that is thought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein

59

receptor-binding to exposed RBDs leads to an unstable 3 RBD-up conformation that results in

60

shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 (11, 12).

61

Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3D

62

refinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2 Å-resolution map, with excellent density

63

for the S2 subunit. Using both maps we built the vast majority of the 2019-nCoV S ectodomain,

64

including glycans at 44 of the 66 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimer (Supplementary Figure

65

4). Our final model spans S residues 27–1146, with several flexible loops omitted. Like all

66

previously reported coronavirus S ectodomain structures, the density for 2019-nCoV S begins to

67

fade after the connector domain (CD), reflecting the flexibility of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2)

68

domain in the prefusion conformation (Supplementary Figure 4A) (13, 16-18).

69

The overall structure of 2019-nCoV S resembles that of SARS-CoV S, with a root mean

70

square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 Å over 959 Cα atoms. The largest discrepancy between these

71

two structures is a conformational difference between the positions of the RBDs in their

72

respective “down” conformations (Figure 2A). Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the “down”

73

conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer,

74

the 2019-nCoV RBD in the “down” conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the

75

homotrimer. Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural

76

domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the

77

high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs,

78

subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2) and S2 subunits yielding RMSD values of 2.6 Å, 3.0 Å, 2.7

79

Å and 2.0 Å, respectively (Figure 2B).

80

2019-nCoV S shares roughly 96% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat

81

coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2

82

protease cleavage site that results in an “RRAR” furin recognition site in 2019-nCoV, rather than

83

the single arginine in SARS-CoV (Supplementary Figure 5) (19-22). A similar phenomenon

84

has been observed for influenza viruses, where amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin

85

site in a related position in influenza hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent

86

avian and human influenza viruses (23). In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2

87

junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these

88

positions mapping to the RBD (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6). We also analyzed the 61

89

available 2019-nCoV S sequences in GISAID and found that there were only 9 amino acid

90

substitutions among all deposited sequences. Most of these substitutions are relatively

91

conservative and they are not expected to have a dramatic effect on the structure or function of

92

the 2019-nCoV S protein (Supplementary Figure 6).

93

Recent reports demonstrating that 2019-nCoV S and SARS-CoV S share the same

94

functional host-cell receptor—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (21, 24-26)—prompted

95

us to quantify the kinetics mediating this interaction via surface plasmon resonance (SPR).

96

Surprisingly, ACE2 bound to 2019-nCoV S ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is

97

approximately 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S (Figure 3A,

98

Supplementary Figure 7) (14). We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S

99

ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, where it strongly resembled the complex

100

formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2, which has been observed at high-resolution by cryo-

101

EM (Figure 3B) (14, 27). The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to

102

the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human-to-human(1), however

103

additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.

104

The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-CoV S and

105

2019-nCoV S prompted us to test published SARS-CoV RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies

106

(mAbs) for cross-reactivity to the 2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 4A). A 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1

107

fragment (S residues 319–591) was recombinantly expressed, and appropriate folding of this

108

construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI)

109

(Figure 4B). Cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396 and 80R was

110

then evaluated by BLI (12, 28-30). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology

111

between the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD

112

could be detected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 µM) (Figure 4C,

113

Supplementary Figure 8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a relatively

114

small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed binding

115

suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that future antibody

116

isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S proteins as probes.

117

The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV, prompting the PHEIC declaration by WHO

118

signals the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. Knowing the atomic-level

119

structure of the spike will support precision vaccine design and discovery of antivirals,

120

facilitating medical countermeasure development.

Materials and Methods

Protein expression and purification

123

To express the prefusion S ectodomain, a gene encoding residues 1−1208 of 2019-nCoV S

124

(GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a “GSAS”

125

substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization

126

motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized and

127

cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH. To express the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1,

128

residues 319−591 of 2019-nCoV S were cloned upstream of a C-terminal HRV3C protease

129

cleavage site, a monomeric Fc tag and an 8XHisTag. Similarly, to express the SARS-CoV RBD-

130

SD1, residues 306−577 of SARS-CoV S (Urbani strain) were cloned upstream of a C-terminal

131

HRV3C protease cleavage site, a monomeric Fc tag and an 8XHisTag. Lastly, a plasmid

132

encoding residues 1−615 of human ACE2 with a C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, a

133

TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was generated.

134

These expression vectors were used to transiently transfect FreeStyle293F cells (Thermo

135

Fischer) using polyethylenimine. Protein was purified from filtered cell supernatants using either

136

StrepTactin resin (IBA) or Protein A resin (Pierce) before being subjected to additional

137

purification by size-exclusion chromatography using either a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE

138

Healthcare) or a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0,

139

200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. ACE2 and the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 were incubated with 10%

140

(wt/wt) HRV3C protease for 2 hours at room temperature. Cleaved protein was then passed over

141

either NiNTA resin (ACE2) or Protein A and NiNTA resins (2019-nCoV RBD) to remove

142

cleaved tags and His-tagged protease before being run over a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase

143

column in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3.

Plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains of S230, 80R and m396 IgG were transiently

transfected into Expi293 (Thermo Fischer) using polyethylenimine. Antibodies were purified

146

from cell supernatants using Protein A resin before being used for biolayer interferometry.

147

Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection

148

Purified 2019-nCoV S was diluted to a concentration of 0.35 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200

149

mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. 3 uL of protein was deposited on a CF-1.2/1.3 grid that had been

150

plasma cleaned for 30 seconds in a Solarus 950 plasma cleaner (Gatan) with a 4:1 ratio of O2/H2.

151

Excess protein was blotted away for 6 seconds before being plunge frozen into liquid ethane

152

using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Scientific). Frozen grids were imaged in a Titan Krios

153

(Thermo Scientific) equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan). Movies were collected using Leginon

154

(31) at a magnification of x22,500, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.047 Å/pixel. A

155

full description of the cryo-EM data collection parameters can be found in Supplementary

156

Table 1.

157

Cryo-EM data processing

158

Motion correction, CTF-estimation and non-templated particle picking were performed in Warp

159

(32). Extracted particles were imported into cryoSPARC v2.12.4 (15) for 2D classification, 3D

160

classification and non-uniform 3D refinement. The C1 RBD “up” reconstruction was sharpened

161

in cryoSPARC, and the 3D reconstruction with C3 symmetry was subjected to local B-factor

162

sharpening using LocalDeBlur (33). Models were built in Coot, before being iteratively refined

163

in both Phenix and ISOLDE (34-36). Some of the data processing and refinement software was

164

curated by SBGrid (37). The full cryo-EM data processing workflow is described in

165

Supplementary Figure 3 and the model refinement statistics can be found in Supplementary
