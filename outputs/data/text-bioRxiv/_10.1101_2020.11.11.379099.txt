Summary. SARS-CoV-2 has become a major problem across the globe, with approximately 50

15

million cases and more than 1 million deaths and currently no approved treatment or vaccine.

16

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the underlying conditions in adults of

17

any age that place them at risk for developing severe illness associated with COVID-19. We

18

established an airway epithelium model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy and COPD

19

lung cells. We found that both the entry receptor ACE2 and the co-factor transmembrane

20

protease TMPRSS2 are expressed at higher levels on nonciliated goblet cell, a novel target for

21

SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 infected goblet cells and induced

22

syncytium formation and cell sloughing. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 replication was

Introduction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, a causative agent

30

of coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) that emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

31

Since then, this pathogen has caused havoc in the healthcare systems worldwide and

32

consequentially ravaged the economy of countries with COVID-19 outbreaks. There is currently

33

no FDA-approved vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a nonsegmented, positive-

34

sense, single-strand RNA virus that causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

35

Most patients exhibit fever and cough, and a subset of patients advance to severe acute

36

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Guan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Therefore, patients

37

with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are vulnerable to COVID-19,

38

and in fact, COPD is one of the high-risk factors for severe illness associated with COVID-19

39

(CDC, 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Sin, 2020).

40

Viral infections begin by the attachment of viral particles to entry receptors on the host

41

cell. The tissue expression and distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin-

42

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its co-factor transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)

43

determine the tropism of virus infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003), and viral

44

infection in human airway epithelium depends on ACE2 expression (Hamming et al., 2004; Jia et

45

al., 2006). For successful entry into cells, SARS-CoV-2 uses the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S

46

protein priming (Hoffmann et al., 2020). ACE2 is highly expressed in the small intestine, testis,

47

kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue and is expressed at moderate expression levels in the

48

lung, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland; and lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow,

49

brain, blood vessels, and muscle (Hamming et al., 2004; Li et al., 2020). ACE2 expression in the

50

lungs is predominantly observed in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (Lukassen et al., 2020; Qi et al.,

51

2020; To and Lo, 2004; Ziegler et al., 2020), but ciliated cells also express ACE2 in the

52

respiratory epithelium (Sims et al., 2005). Recent RNAseq-based studies have suggested that

53

ACE2 is more highly expressed on goblet cells in the nasal airways and on secretory cells in

54

subsegmental bronchial branches of the lung (Lukassen et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020;

55

Ziegler et al., 2020). Although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions are higher in nonciliated goblet

56

cells compared to ciliated cells (Lukassen et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020;

57

Ziegler et al., 2020), it appears that goblet cells are underappreciated in the SARS-CoV-2

58

infection studies. The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infects goblet cells could explain the

59

presence of viral RNA in sputum (Wang et al., 2020) and might explain the efficient

60

transmission of the virus from person to person (Dhand and Li, 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020).

61

Importantly, goblet cell hyperplasia is a characteristic pathological feature of COPD patients,

62

who are vulnerable to severe disease associated with COVID-19 (Lippi and Henry, 2020;

63

Shimura et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 2020). Therefore, it is prudent to determine to what extent

64

SARS-CoV-2 infects goblet cells in the lung.

65

To determine the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and its preferential cell tropism

66

in the lung, we developed an in vitro airway epithelium model by differentiating primary normal

67

human bronchial (NHBE) cells derived from either a patient with COPD or a healthy adult (non-

68

COPD). The COPD airway epithelium model recapitulates many bronchial characteristics of

COPD. We evaluated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and studied SARS-CoV-2

70

infection in these in vitro airway epithelium models. We found that SARS-CoV-2 primarily

71

infects nonciliated goblet cells due to high expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in these

72

cells. Goblet cell hyperplasia increases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the COPD airway

73

epithelium. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 targeting and replication in goblet cells may explain the

74

development of more severe COVID-19 in COPD patients.

Results.

77

The airway epithelium model recapitulates the chronic bronchial characteristics of COPD.

78

We first established an in vitro airway epithelium model by differentiating NHBE cells from

79

either a healthy adult or a COPD patient (deidentified) at the air-liquid interface (ALI). We found

80

that 4 weeks of differentiation provides a fully differentiated pseudostratified mucociliary airway

81

epithelium for both conditions (Figures 1A and B), which allows the use of this model for side-

82

by-side comparisons. NHBE cells from a healthy adult differentiated primarily into a

83

pseudostratified columnar epithelium, whereas the NHBE cells from a COPD patient

84

differentiated into a mix of pseudostratified and stratified columnar epithelium that contained all

85

three main cell types of the respiratory epithelium (Pawlina, 2016; Rayner et al., 2019; Rigden et

86

al., 2016): ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells (Figure 1B). We found that the apical site of

87

the epithelium mainly consists of ciliated and nonciliated goblet cells (Figures 1C and D).

88

Studies have shown that mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is predominately expressed by airway goblet

89

cells and that mucin 5B (MUC5B) is expressed by goblet cells of submucosal glands (Whitsett,

90

2018). Club cells are the progenitors of goblet cells, which might express both MUC5AC and

91

MUC5B (Kiyokawa and Morimoto, 2020; Okuda et al., 2019). As expected, we found

92

heterogenicity in the cell population with differential expression of common goblet cell markers

93

(Figure 1E) (Lukassen et al., 2020). Basal cells are known for their self-renewal property and

94

give rise to multiple types of differentiated airway epithelial cells (Crystal, 2014). For the

95

detection of basal cells, we sectioned the epithelium and stained the sections for the basal cell

96

marker P63 (Persson et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2002). We found that basal cells reside at the basal

97

membrane of both epithelia and that the COPD epithelium has more basal cells than the healthy

98

epithelium as it is known from respiratory epithelium of COPD patients (Figure 1F) (Higham et

99

al., 2019; Polosukhin et al., 2011).

100

COPD is associated with abnormal airway and alveolar responses during exposure to

101

noxious stimuli (Brusselle et al., 2011). Because our COPD airway epithelium model was

102

differentiated from NHBE cells, it should recapitulate the bronchial airway phenotypes instead of

103

the alveolar phenotype as more commonly associated with emphysema (Barnes, 2013). To

104

determine whether our in vitro COPD airway epithelium model recapitulates some of the

105

bronchial pathophysiological characteristics of COPD, we focused on two different aspects:

106

goblet cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia. First, we compared the number of MUC5AC+

107

or MUC5B+ goblet cells between healthy and COPD epithelia. We found a higher ratio of goblet

108

cells in the COPD airway epithelium (Figures 1G and H). The higher number of goblet cells in

109

the COPD epithelium suggests a persistent goblet cell differentiation, which results in goblet cell

110

hyperplasia (Kim et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2018; Shaykhiev, 2019). Indeed, we found a patch of

111

higher number of goblet cells with extensive mucus secretion in the COPD epithelium (Figure

112

1I, center). We also found an apparent loss of pseudostratified epithelium accompanied by

113

squamous metaplasia in the COPD epithelium, which is a common pathological phenotype in

114

COPD (Figure 1I, right) (Rigden et al., 2016).

115

To determine the biophysical properties of these respiratory epithelia, we assessed the

116

tissue membrane integrity (transepithelial electrical resistance, TEER) and ciliary function

117

(ciliary beat frequency, CBF) and found no significant difference in these biophysical properties

118

between healthy and COPD epithelia (Figures 1J and K). These results indicated that NHBE

119

cells from patients with COPD produced a mix of pseudostratified and stratified highly

120

differentiated mucociliary epithelium with appropriate biophysical properties.

121
122

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed at higher levels in goblet cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects the

123

human airway epithelium, and virus entry depends on the host cell receptors ACE2 and its co-

124

factor TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). We quantified the ACE2 transcript levels in a lung

125

epithelial cell line (A549 cells) and primary NHBE cells in a monolayer or in the differentiated

126

airway epithelium by real-time PCR. We did not detect ACE2 transcripts in the A549 cells

127

(Figure S1A), which might indicate low or no expression of ACE2 confirming previous data

128

(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Harcourt et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2005).

129

However, we detected ACE2 transcripts in primary NHBE cells in both the monolayer and

130

differentiated airway epithelium (Figure S1A). Despite their similar biophysical properties

131

(tissue barrier integrity and ciliary function, Figures 1J and K, respectively), ACE2 expression

132

was higher in the COPD epithelium compared to those derived from a healthy donor (Figures

133

S1A-C). We then visualized the expression of ACE2 in the airway epithelium by

134

immunofluorescence imaging. We observed ACE2 expression in both the healthy and COPD

135

airway epithelia and found that ACE2 expression hardly overlapped with cilia on the apical site

136

of the epithelium (Figures 2A and S1D). Nevertheless, low levels of ACE2 expression were

137

observed on ciliated cells in our model (Figure S1E). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2

138

entry receptor ACE2 is mainly expressed on non-ciliated cells in the respiratory epithelium.

139

Because ACE2 staining hardly overlapped with acetyl-alpha-tubulin, we tested the

140

expression of ACE2 along with that of the goblet and club cell markers MUC5AC and MUC5B

141

(Lukassen et al., 2020). Indeed, ACE2 overlapped with MUC5AC (Figure 2B) and MUC5B

142

(Figures 2C and S1F). We also compared ACE2 expression with the expression of E-cadherin

143

and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), markers for adherens junction and tight junction proteins,

144

respectively. The results showed that ACE2 expression did not overlap with apical tight

145

junctions or adherent junctions (Figure S2), which suggests that ACE2 expression is primarily

146

located within the cellular boundary and does not impact the tissue barrier integrity of the

147

respiratory epithelium. Overall, ACE2 expression was higher in the COPD than in the healthy

148

epithelium (Figures 2 and S1-2), which is likely due to the presence of goblet cell hyperplasia in

149

the COPD epithelium and thus a higher number of goblet cells.

150
151

TMPRSS2 is an important host co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells

152

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lukassen et al., 2020; Shulla et al., 2011). We visualized TMPRSS2 in

153

the apical site of the airway epithelium by staining with anti-TMPRSS2 and found that

154

TMPRSS2 expression hardly overlapped with cilium (Figure 3A). We then tested the expression

155

of TMPRSS2 along with that of the goblet cell markers MUC5AC and MUC5B. Indeed,

156

TMPRSS2 overlapped with MUC5AC (Figure 3B) and MUC5B (Figures 3C). Therefore, it

157

appears that both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are expressed on the same cell surface (Figures 2 and 3).

158

These results indicate that goblet cells may be a novel target of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the

159

respiratory epithelium.

161

SARS-CoV-2 infects goblet cells. Although we confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors are

162

expressed at higher levels on nonciliated goblet cells, a number of previous studies have

163

suggested that SARS-CoV-2 targets ciliated cells (Hou et al., 2020; Lamers et al., 2020).

164

Therefore, we first examined whether SARS-CoV-2 infects nonciliated goblet cells. We infected

165

the apical side of the airway epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1

166

(MOI = 0.1). At 4 days post infection (DPI), we fixed the cells and stained them for SARS-CoV-

167

2 nucleoprotein (N) and a ciliated cell marker. The results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infects

168

both healthy and COPD epithelium and causes a substantial cytopathic effect (CPE) (Figures

169

S3A and B). SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the COPD epithelium than in the healthy

170

epithelium, as will be addressed later in the manuscript. Although in some cases the virus-

171

induced extensive CPE made it difficult to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism, we focused on

172

multiple random areas with less CPE but virus infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects

173

nonciliated cells in both healthy and COPD epithelium (Figure 4A). We also used a second

174

detection method to visualize viral and cellular markers in cross sections of the epithelium.

175

Immunohistochemistry-based staining confirmed the extensive CPE induced by SARS-CoV-2 in

176

both healthy and COPD epithelium. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 infected both ciliated and

177

nonciliated epithelial cells in the airway epithelium (Figure 4B). Using staining strategies similar

178

to those described before, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infects MUC5B-positive (Figures 4C and

179

D) and MUC5AC-postive (Figure 4E) goblet cells. To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infects

180

basal cells, we stained the sectioned epithelium for P63 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein.

181

We did not observe any overlap between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the basal cell marker

182

(Figure S4). These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects nonciliated goblet cells in addition

183

to ciliated cells.

184
185

SARS-CoV-2 induces syncytia and cell sloughing in the airway epithelium. To determine

186

whether SARS-CoV-2 infection in the airway epithelium recapitulates the virus-induced

187

pathophysiology in the lung, we examined the infected epithelium under a confocal microscope

188

and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes substantial damage to the apical site of the infected

189

epithelium, as confirmed by extensive CPE in both healthy and COPD epithelium (Figure S3).

190

We also found substantial mucus secretion due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The apical damage of

191

the SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelium included loss of cellular junctions, loss of ciliary damage,

192

substantial mucus production, and the protraction of nuclei, which are all common features

193

observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs (Schaefer et al., 2020). Additionally, we investigated

194

whether SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in the epithelium might form syncytium (multinucleated

195

cell), a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung (Giacca et al., 2020) that had also been

196

reported for SARS-CoV-1 (Franks et al., 2003). Indeed, we found that SARS-CoV-2-infected

197

cells formed syncytia in both healthy and COPD epithelia (Figure 5A and B). Cell sloughing has

198

been reported from lung autopsy findings of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (Schaefer et al.,

199

2020). Therefore, we examined whether SARS-CoV-2 infection in our epithelium model

200

recapitulates cell sloughing. Indeed, we found that SARS-CoV-2 induces cell sloughing in both

201

healthy and COPD epithelia as confirmed by two independent methods, immunofluorescence

202

and IHC (Figures 5C and D). These results demonstrate that hallmark pathological features of

203

SARS-CoV-2 are recapitulated in the infected airway epithelium model.

205

SARS-CoV-2 replicates higher and exacerbates pathophysiology in COPD epithelium. To

206

determine whether SARS-CoV-2 replicates better in the COPD epithelium, we titered SARS-

207

CoV-2 in the apical wash of the infected epithelium and found that SARS-CoV-2 replication was

208

increased by almost a log in the COPD compared to the healthy epithelium (Figure 6A). In

209

addition, we found a squamous metaplasia in SARS-CoV-2-infected COPD epithelium which

210

was rather infrequently found in the SARS-CoV-2-infected healthy epithelium (Figures 1I; 4B,

211

D, and E, and 5B and D) (Borczuk et al., 2020). Squamous metaplasia is known to increase

212

bronchial wall thickening as seen in bronchitis (Randell, 2006; Reid et al., 2018; Rigden et al.,

213

2016). As tracheobronchitis is one of the most common histopathological features in the

214

COVID-19 disease fatalities (Martines et al., 2020), we evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2

215

infection increases height of the epithelium. First, there was a substantial increase in squamous

216

metaplasia in the COPD epithelium due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S5). Second, the

217

increased metaplasia apparently changed the morphology of the nonciliated goblet cells in the

218

infected COPD epithelium (Figures 6B and C). Whether this change in the goblet cell

219

morphology impacted the mucus hyperplasia remains to be determined. Third, in contrast to the

220

healthy epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 induced higher squamous metaplasia in the infected COPD

221

epithelium and caused a substantial increase in the height of the epithelium (Figure 6D). These

222

results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replicates better in the COPD epithelium and exacerbates

223

pathophysiology in the infected airway epithelium.

224
225

Discussion.

226

Here, we have shown that the COPD epithelium model recapitulates the bronchial

227

biophysical and pathophysiological characteristics of COPD, such as goblet cell hyperplasia and

228

squamous metaplasia (Gohy et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2018; Rigden et al., 2016).

229

A previous report suggested the presence of altered ciliated cells in COPD airway epithelium

230

(Gohy et al., 2019), which was not observed in our model. The duration of cell differentiation

231

may be the reason, as we differentiated NHBE cells for four weeks that may require to see

232

terminal differentiation (including ciliogenesis) (Gohy et al., 2019). We used an air-liquid

233

interface (ALI) culture method to generate multi-cellular diversity and physiologic functioning

234

airway epithelium that resembles the airway surface in vivo (Fulcher et al., 2005; Pawlina, 2016;

235

Rayner et al., 2019). One of the limitations in the ALI culture research is passaging of primary

236

NHBE cells may impact on their ability to differentiate into airway epithelium. We could

237

demonstrate that primary NHBE cells obtained after four passages without using any additional

238

supplements can still be differentiated into human airway epithelium (Rayner et al., 2019). In a

239

separate study, we confirmed that passaging NHBE cells up to four times has insignificant effect

240

on the whole-genome transcriptome by comparing transcriptome profiles of each passage cells

241

(data not shown). The ability to expand primary cells that also form fully differentiated

242

mucociliary epithelium reduces repeat sample collections from patients where samples are

243

difficult and limited, such as infants and deceased patients (Rayner et al., 2019; Wolf et al.,

244

2017). Our results demonstrate primary NHBE cells either from healthy or a COPD patient can

245

be passaged up to four times and that normal epithelial phenotypic features are maintained in

246

passaged primary NHBE cells.

247

One emergent question is why the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is

248

much higher compared to SARS-CoV-1, although both viruses share ACE2 as cell surface

249

receptor and use TMPRSS2 to facilitate their entry into the host cell (Hoffmann et al., 2020;

250

251

is absent in SARS-CoV-1, and it is hypothesized that furin cleavage facilitates human-to-human

252

transmission (Coutard et al., 2020; Lukassen et al., 2020). We found that SARS-CoV-2 infected

253

both ciliated cells and nonciliated goblet cells, but not basal cells in the airway epithelium.

254

Although SARS-CoV-2 may preferentially infect goblet cells due to the higher expression of

255

ACE2 and TMPRSS2, further studies are needed to confirm temporal and spatial regulations of

256

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the airway epithelium. The major function of goblet cells in the lung

257

epithelium is mucin production to trap pathogens, dust, and particles, which are cleared by a

258

process known as mucociliary clearance (Rogers, 2003). The possibility that SARS-CoV-2

259

infects goblet cells could explain the presence of viral RNA in sputum (Wang et al., 2020) and

260

might explain the easy transmission of the virus from person to person. While we are preparing

261

our manuscript, Hao et al., have shown that goblet cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection

262

(Hao et al., 2020). As SARS-CoV-1 infection is limited to ciliated cells (Sims et al., 2005), we

263

think that SARS-CoV-2 infection in goblet cells could explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more

264

transmissible than SARS-CoV-1. Influenza A virus infects goblet cells in addition to ciliated

265

cells (Matrosovich et al., 2004), whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects only ciliated

266

cells (Zhang et al., 2002). Therefore, virus-specific preferential cell tropism in the lung could

267

explain the difference in respiratory virus pathogenicity and transmissibility.

268

Our airway epithelium model recapitulated some SARS-CoV-2-induced lung

269

histopathological findings, such as prominent nucleoli (Schaefer et al., 2020), cytoplasmic

270

vacuolation, multinucleated giant cells (Falasca et al., 2020), squamous metaplasia (Martines et

271

al., 2020) and epithelial cell sloughing, which is the most common finding (Bradley et al., 2020).

272

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the bronchial epithelium models induced a substantial amount of cell

273

syncytium formation and cell sloughing, which indicates that tracheobronchial cells are highly

12

274

associated with virus-induced pathogenesis. Therefore, our data suggest that bronchial cells are

275

equally important to alveolar cells in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (Martines et al., 2020). In

276

patients with COPD, goblet cell hyperplasia is a common clinical manifestation, and an

277

increasing number of goblet cells results in more mucus production (Shaykhiev, 2019). Because

278

we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 replicated at a higher rate in the COPD epithelium, we believe

279

that goblet cell hyperplasia is responsible for this phenomenon and may explain why COPD

280

patients are at higher risk for severe outcome of COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that SARS-

281

CoV-2 infection induced “squamous metaplasia” in the COPD epithelium. Squamous metaplasia

282

in the columnar epithelium corelates with increased severity of airway obstruction in COPD

283

(Araya et al., 2007). Although squamous metaplasia is one of the histopathological findings in

284

the SARS-CoV-2 infected patient fatalities (Martines et al., 2020), our results provide evidence

285

for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases squamous metaplasia, which may result in

286

bronchitis in the infected COPD patients. In fact, tracheobronchitis is one of the most common

287

histopathological features in the COVID-19 disease fatalities (Martines et al., 2020). No SARS-

288

CoV-2 infectious virion was detected in the basal medium of the infected healthy and COPD

289

epithelia, which might suggest that the initial virus-induced substantial damage was limited at the

290

apical site.

291

Immune responses to viral infection play a critical role in determining the clinical

292

outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Huang et al., 2020). Unfortunately, our airway epithelium

293

model lacks both resident and infiltrating immune cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and

294

lymphocytes, etc.) and is devoid of the endothelial layer, and therefore cannot study the impact

295

of immune responses on the SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, we can provide inferences based

296

on the detection of immunoregulatory factors (chemokines and cytokines), but these hypotheses

297

remain to be confirmed. Overall, we believe that the airway epithelium model provides an

298

excellent tool for demystifying some of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiological features and

299

identifying and testing novel therapeutics against the virus.

300

In conclusion, we developed in vitro lung airway epithelium models from passaged

301

primary NHBE cells of either a healthy or a COPD patient. Our studies revealed SARS-CoV-2

302

infection of goblet cells leading to virus-induced syncytium formation and cell sloughing in the

303

airway epithelium. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates better COPD airway epithelium likely

304

due to COPD associated goblet cell hyperplasia. Thus, we postulate that goblet cells play a

305

critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung and are responsible for more severe outcome

306

of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COPD patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

488

Cells. Primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells from either a deidentified

489

healthy adult (female, aged 52 years, never-smoker) or a patient with chronic obstructive

490

pulmonary disease (COPD) were obtained under an approved material transfer agreement

491

(MTA) between the Mehedi Laboratory at University of North Dakota (UND) and Bailey

492

Laboratory at University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), Omaha, NE. A549 cells (a

493

human lung epithelial cell line, ATCC-185) were obtained from Dr. Peter Collins at the National

494

Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA. Vero cells used for TCID50 assay were a

495

resource of the Feldmann Lab at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT.

496
497

Virus. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) was kindly provided by CDC

498

as Vero passage 3 (Harcourt et al., 2020). The virus was propagated once in Vero E6 cells in

499

DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 mM L-

500

glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermo

501

Fisher Scientific) (virus isolation medium). The virus stock used in this study was 100%

502

identical to the initially deposited GenBank sequence (MN985325.1); sequencing did not detect

503

any virus stock contaminants.

504
505

Biosafety Statement. Work with SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the high biocontainment

506

facilities at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), NAID, NIH in Hamilton, MT.

507

infectious work followed standard operating procedures (SOPs) approved by the Institutional

508

Biosafety Committee.

METHOD DETAILS:

511

Cell culture. We passaged the primary NHBE cells (passage 1) three times before differentiating

512

them (passage 4) into a pseudostratified epithelium. For each passage, the cells were grown in a

513

100-mm culture dish (Corning Inc.) precoated with PurCol (Advanced Biometrics). The cells

514

were maintained in airway epithelial cell (AEC) growth medium (PromoCell) containing AEC

515

supplements (PromoCell), 2% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermos Fisher Scientific), and 1%

516

amphotericin B (Thermos Fisher Scientific) (complete AEC medium) at 37°C in an incubator

517

with 5% CO2. The cells were grown to 90% confluency, and the medium was changed every

518

other day. Confluent monolayers of cells were dissociated with 5 ml of TrypLE (Thermo Fisher

519

Scientific) and pelleted, and one-third of the cells were reseeded in a culture dish containing

520

complete AEC medium for passaging. A549 cells were grown in F-12 medium (Thermo Fisher

521

Scientific) with 10% HyClone fetal bovine serum (GE Healthcare), 2% penicillin/streptomycin,

522

and 1% amphotericin B.

523
524

Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture. Transwells (6.5 mm) with 0.4-µm-pore polyester membrane

525

inserts (Corning Inc.) were coated with PureCol for 20 minutes before cell seeding. NHBE cells

526

(5x10^4) suspended in 200 µl of complete AEC medium were seeded in the apical part of a

527

Transwell. Subsequently, 500 µl of complete AEC medium was added to the basal part of the

528

Transwell. When the cells formed a confluent layer on the Transwell insert, the AEC medium

529

was removed from the apical part, and PneumaCult-ALI basal medium (Stemcell Technologies)

530

with the required supplements (Stemcell Technologies), 2% penicillin/streptomycin and 1%

531

amphotericin B (complete ALI basal medium) was added to the basal part. The ALI medium in

532

the basal part was changed every other day, and the apical surface was washed with 1x

533

Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) once per week initially

534

but more frequently when more mucus was observed on later days. However, the thickness of the

535

mucus was not determined. All the cells were differentiated for at least 4 weeks at 37°C in an

536

incubator with 5% CO2.

537
538

Transportation of Transwells containing airway epithelia. The differentiated airway epithelia

539

for 22 days were transported in transportation medium at 4°C via overnight FedEx biological

540

material shipment to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML, Hamilton, MT, USA). The

541

semisolid transportation medium was prepared by adding agarose to the complete AEC medium.

542

Upon receipt, the Transwells containing airway epithelia were immediately transferred into new

543

plates with complete AEC medium in the basal part and maintained before infection as described

544

in the section on ALI culture.

545
546

Virus infection. Virus infection was conducted in the high biocontainment facilities at RML,

547

NIAID, NIH. The 4-week-differentiated airway epithelia were washed with 200 µl of 1x PBS to

548

remove mucus and infected on the apical site with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 in 1x PBS for

549

1 hour (at 37°C with 5% CO2). For mock infection, the assigned Transwells were similarly

550

incubated with 1x PBS without virus. The viral inoculum was then removed, and the epithelia

551

were washed twice with 200 µl of 1x PBS. Two hundred microliters of apical wash and basal

552

medium were collected for virus titration. Fresh ALI medium (1000 µl) with supplements was

553

added to the basal part of each Transwell, and the apical part was kept empty. Mock-infected and

SARS-CoV-2-infected Transwells were incubated for 4 days at 37°C in an incubator with 5%

555

CO2.

556
557

Tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50). Vero cells were seeded on 96-well plates to

558

confluency, and SARS-CoV-2 endpoint titration was performed. The cells were inoculated with

559

10-fold dilutions of the supernatants collected during the experiment in DMEM, 2% FBS, L-

560

glutamine and P/S. The cells were incubated for 7 days, and the cytopathic effect (CPE) was

561

scored under a microscope. The TCID50 was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula (Reed

562

and Muench, 1938).

563
564

Virus-infected sample collection. At 4 DPI, 200 µl of 1x PBS was added to the apical site of

565

the Transwell and incubated for several minutes, and the apical wash was collected for virus

566

titration. Similarly, basal medium was collected for virus titration. All the samples were stored at

567

-80°C until titration. For PFA fixation, 200 µl of 4% PFA was added at the apical site of the

568

Transwells and incubated for 30 minutes, and the Transwells were further maintained overnight

569

in 4% PFA before being transported outside of the BSL4 lab according to the standard protocol

570

of RML. For protein and RNA sample collections, 200 µl of 1x PBS was added to the apical side

571

of each Transwell, and cells were scrapped with a mini scrapper, collected into a cryovial, and

572

pelleted by being spun down with a table-top bench centrifuge. For the protein samples, 100 µl

573

of 2x SDS buffer was added to the cryovials containing the cell pellet, and the tube was boiled

574

for 10 minutes. After a quick spin, the samples were transferred into new tubes and removed

575

from the BSL4 laboratory using a standard RML protocol. For the RNA samples, the cell pellets

576

were resuspended in 600 µl of RLT buffer (Qiagen) and transported out of the laboratory based

on the RML protocol with 600 µl of ethanol. RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy mini

578

kit (QIAGEN) and eluted in 50 µl of RNase-free water. All the samples were shipped to Mehedi

579

Lab at UND using an appropriate overnight biological shipment procedure.

581

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Four days post infection, NHBE-ALI and COPD-ALI

582

mock and infected Transwells were fixed with 4% PFA for 24 hours. The membrane was cut off

583

using a scalpel and embedded in paraffin mold. Five-micrometer sections were cut using a

584

microtome. H&E staining was performed by two 5-minute Histo-Clear incubations followed by

585

three 5-minute incubations with 100% ethanol, one 5-minute incubation with 95% ethanol and

586

one 5-minute incubation with 70% ethanol. Subsequently, the samples were washed with tap

587

water for 2 minutes, incubated with 4% acidified Harries Hematoxylin for 2 minutes, washed

588

with tap water for 2 minutes, and incubated with 0.5% lithium carbonate for 20 seconds. The

589

samples were subsequently washed with tap water for 5 minutes, incubated with Eosin Y

590

Solution with Pholoxine for 2 minutes and then subjected to a series of ethanol incubations:

591

incubation with 70% ethanol for 5 minutes, incubation with 95% ethanol for 5 minutes and three

592

5-minutes incubation with 100% ethanol. Finally, two 5-minute incubations with Histo-Clear

593

were performed, and coverslips were then placed using permanent mounting medium.

594
595

Alcian blue staining. The 5-µm sectioned ALI-NHBE and COPD mock and infected samples

596

were also subjected to Alcian blue staining. The sections were deparaffinized as described in the

597

section on H&E staining using Histo-Clear and ethanol. The cells were then washed with tap

598

water for 2 minutes, incubated in 3% acetic acid for 3 minutes and stained with Alcian blue for

599

30 minutes. The sections were subsequently rinsed with 3% acetic acid for 10 seconds to help

601

rinsed for 2 minutes in Milli-Q water. The sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red

602

solution for 5 minutes and washed under tap water for 5 minutes. The sections were subsequently

603

dehydrated and cleared with a gradient of alcohol and Histo-Clear as in the protocol used for

604

H&E staining. The slides were mounted with permanent mounting medium and coverslipped.

611

with the following primary antibodies (Abs) (alone or in combination) in IF washing buffer

612

overnight at 4°C: anti-ZO-1 rabbit polyclonal (1:200) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-E-

623

(Cytoskeleton Inc.) in IF washing buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After

624

two washes with PBS, the cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain ReadyProbes

625

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The epithelium was

626

mounted on Tech-Med microscope slides (Thomas Scientific) using ProLong-Gold anti-fade

627

mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured using a confocal laser-

628

scanning microscope (Olympus FV3000) enabled with a 60X objective. The 405-nm laser was

629

used to excite the DAPI signal for nucleus detection, the 488-nm laser was used to excite Alexa

630

Flour 488 for MUC5AC, ACE2, TMPRSS2 or SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein detection, the

631

561-nm laser was used to excite rhodamine phalloidin for F-actin detection, and the 640-nm laser

632

was used to excite Alexa Flour 647 for MUC5B, acetyl-alpha-tubulin, E-cadherin, ZO-1 or

633

MUC5AC detection. At least two random fields were selected per sample and imaged. The

634

images were processed with Imaris software version 9.5.1 (Oxford Instruments Group) and used

635

for the conversion of Z-stack images (.oir format) to .tiff format and for additional image

636

postprocessing. Separately, the tiling of Z-stack (3x3) images was captured using a Leica DMi8

637

microscope followed by image processing using a 3D deconvolution image processing module in

638

the LASX software (Leica Microsystem) associated with the microscope. We used nine

639

independent images to quantify the total cell number based on F-actin (Texas Red channel) and

640

goblet cells using the Alexa Flour 647 channel (anti-MUC5B) with the Fiji multipointer option.

641

Similarly, we quantified the MUC5AC+ cells using at least two confocal images.

646

allowed to cool in the buffer overnight and washed three times in PBST (0.05% Tween-20) for

647

10 minutes. Using a Pap pen, a hydrophobic barrier was drawn around the tissue. Once the

648

hydrophobic barrier was dry, the tissue was incubated with blocking buffer (10% goat serum in

649

PBS) for 2 hours in a humidified, light-protected chamber. After incubation with blocking buffer,

650

the tissue was immediately incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in a

651

humidified, light-protected chamber: SARS-CoV-2 N (1:50) (Thermo Fischer Scientific) for the

652

detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (1:100) (Thermo

653

Fischer Scientific) for the detection of SARS-CoV2 S protein, acetylated-alpha-tubulin (1:500)

654

(Cell Signaling Technologies) for the staining of ciliated cells, MUC5AC (1:500) (Cell Signaling

655

Technologies) and MUC5B (1:500) (Atlas Antibodies) for the staining of goblet cells, and P63

656

(1:100) (Abcam Inc.) for the staining of basal cells. The next day, the slides were washed three

657

times with PBST and then incubated for 45 minutes with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo

658

Fisher Scientific) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) secondary

659

antibodies in a humidified, light-protected chamber. The slides were subsequently washed three

660

times with PBST, incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (1:100) (Cytoskeleton Inc.) for 30

661

minutes at room temperature in a humidified, light-protected chamber, and washed three times

662

with PBST. The nuclei were then stained by incubation with NucBlue Fixed Cell Stain

663

ReadyProbes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 minutes at room temperature in a humidified,

664

light-protected chamber. After incubation with the nuclear dye, the slides were washed once with

665

PBST and twice with DI water, and coverglass was then placed on the tissue section using

were further processed using a 3D deconvolution image processing module in the LASX

669

software (Leica Microsystem) associated with the microscope.

670
671

Ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Cilia on the apical surface of the cells in the differentiated

672

epithelial layer (after 4 weeks of differentiation) were visualized in the phase-contrast mode with

673

a Leica DMi8 microscope with a 20X objective and an attached environment control chamber

674

(37°C with 5% CO2) (Leica Microsystems). For each Transwell, six different random fields were

675

recorded for approximately 2.1 seconds at 120 frames per second. The images were captured at

676

37°C and analyzed using the Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis (SAVA) system V.2.1.15 to

677

determine the CBF (Hz) (Ammons Engineering).

678
679

Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The permeability of the differentiated epithelial

680

layer (after 4 weeks of differentiation) was determined by measuring the TEER using an

681

epithelial volt-ohm meter (EVOM2, World Precision Instruments, Inc.). The EVOM2 was

682

calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the STX2 electrode was sterilized

683

with 70% ethanol before use. The internal electrode (smaller in size) was placed in the apical

684

part of each Transwell (PBS was added during the TEER reading), and the external electrode

685

(larger in size) was placed in the basal part of the Transwell, which contained ALI basal medium,

686

to measure the membrane voltage and resistance of the epithelial layer. An empty Transwell

687

insert (filled with PBS) containing no NHBE cells was used to correct for the background

688

resistance. Three readings were taken for each Transwell. The TEER value of each sample was

689

calculated by subtracting the background value.

691

Quantitative real-time PCR. Airway epithelia cultured on 6.5-mm Transwell membranes were

692

washed and treated for 1 minute at RT with RLT buffer (Qiagen) with 1% β-mercaptoethanol

693

(Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were scraped using a cell scraper, collected into a QIAshredder tube

694

and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and 4°C for 3 minutes. The eluate was used for the extraction of

695

total RNA using a Total DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and DNase I treatment was

696

performed to remove DNA from the samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We

697

also followed a similar approach for the extraction of RNA from A549 cells. The RNA

698

concentration was determined with an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek). Five

699

hundred nanograms of RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

700

using Oligo(dT) primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan

701

assays (ACE2: Hs1085333_m1 and ACTB: Hs99999903_m1, for calibration) (Thermo Fisher

702

Scientific) with the CFX384 Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad), and fold changes were

703

calculated to determine the relative expression levels.

704
705

Western blotting. The airway epithelium cultured on 6.5-mm Transwell membranes was

706

washed with PBS, scraped out of all the cells, and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5

707

minutes. The cell pellet was incubated with 1x LDS loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

708

with proteinase inhibitor (Roche), transferred into a QIAshredder microcentrifuge tube, and

709

centrifuged for 3 minutes at 15,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge. The elusion from the

710

QIAshredder was collected and stored in a freezer. The protein concentration was measured

711

using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the detection of ACE2, total

712

protein (30 µg) was separated on 4-12% Bis-tris SDS polyacrylamide gels (reducing) and then

713

subjected to dry blot transfer onto PVDF membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions

(Life Technologies). The PVDF membrane was imaged using an Odyssey CLX system (Li-Cor

715

Biosciences). ACE2 was detected by Western blotting using anti-ACE2 goat polyclonal antibody

716

(R&D Systems) and corresponding donkey anti-goat IRDye 800 secondary antibodies (Li-Cor

717

Biosciences). For the loading control, alpha-tubulin was detected by anti-alpha-tubulin mouse

718

monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and the corresponding goat anti-mouse IRDye 680

719

secondary antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences). Image Studio 5.2 (LI-COR Biosciences) was used to

720

quantify the protein signal.

721
722

Epithelial height measurement. Microscopic images of the IHC (described above) were used to

723

quantify epithelial height by using the scale feature in LASX software of Leica DMi8

724

microscope. We used at least 4 independent slides for the measurement, at least three

725

independent reads per slide. The plastic membrane of the Transwell was not included in the

726

height measurement.
