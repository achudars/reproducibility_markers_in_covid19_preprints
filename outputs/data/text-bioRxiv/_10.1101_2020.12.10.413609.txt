Abstract
There are currently no cures for coronavirus infections, making the prevention of infections the
only course open at the present time. The COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult to prevent,
as the infection is spread by respiratory droplets and thus effective, scalable and safe preventive
interventions are urgently needed. We hypothesise that preventing viral entry into mammalian
nasal epithelial cells may be one way to limit the spread of COVID-19. Here we show that Npalmitoyl-N-monomethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N,N,N-trimethyl-6-O-glycolchitosan

(GCPQ),

a

positively charged polymer that has been through an extensive Good Laboratory Practice
toxicology screen, is able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-COV-2 in A549ACE2+ and Vero E6
cells with a log removal value of -3 to -4 at a concentration of 10 – 100 µg/ mL (p < 0.05
compared to untreated controls) and to limit infectivity in human airway epithelial cells at a
concentration of 500 µg/ mL (p < 0.05 compared to untreated controls). GCPQ is currently
being developed as a pharmaceutical excipient in nasal and ocular formulations. GCPQ’s
electrostatic binding to the virus, preventing viral entry into the host cells, is the most likely
mechanism of viral inhibition. Radiolabelled GCPQ studies in mice show that at a dose of 10
mg/ kg, GCPQ has a long residence time in mouse nares, with 13.1% of the injected dose
identified from SPECT/CT in the nares, 24 hours after nasal dosing.

With a no observed

adverse effect level of 18 mg/ kg in rats, following a 28-day repeat dose study, clinical testing
of this polymer, as a COVID-19 prophylactic is warranted.

Introduction
There are currently no cures for a wide variety of viral infections, including the ones caused by
emerging flaviviruses and coronaviruses, which are regularly causing local outbreaks,
epidemics, and pandemics 1. Respiratory infections seem to be of special importance, as due to
the transmission route, it is almost impossible to control the spread in the population. While
common respiratory infections are frequently neglected, it should be borne in mind that
seasonal influenza virus claims 200,000 – 500,000 lives annually 2. The year 2020 brought us
the third zoonotic coronavirus in the 21st century – SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19
disease 1.

COVID-19 ranges from mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe

progressive viral pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death 1. By the beginning of the year the
race to develop drugs or re-purpose drugs to prevent coronaviral infection or ease the symptoms
had started. Unfortunately, most of the efforts were futile, and the most promising agents such
as remdesivir 3 and convalescent plasma 4 did not live up to their expectations. While passive
and active immunisation efforts are ongoing, there is still a need for novel prophylaxis
interventions, especially as some of the more promising vaccine technologies neutralise
systemic virus, but not viral particles within the nasal epithelia, making it impossible to tell if
vaccinated persons would not still transmit the disease 5. Here, we describe the activity of a
polymer that has been developed previously as a pharmaceutical excipient, has been through a
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology screen 6-9 and may readily be used to prevent or
limit COVID-19 infections, e.g., in health-care workers or other persons at risk from severe
disease.
Viral binding to cell-surface receptors present in the respiratory tract is a critical step, that
enables SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell and initiate replication. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the
receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike (S) protein to bind to the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor

10-12

present, amongst others, on the ciliated cells of the human

respiratory epithelium 13,14. This enables activation of the S protein by the cell surface serine
proteases and subsequent conformational change, which results in membrane fusion of the viral
particle with the cell and ultimately RNA delivery to the replication site 10,12,15,16. Blockade of
these early steps is a known strategy to prevent the infection of mammalian cells, and has been
proven effective for e.g., neutralizing antibodies 17 and fusion inhibitors 18.
Polymers, such as sulphated glycopolymers have been shown to inhibit the viral binding of
human papilloma virus to cell surface receptors

19

. Sulphated chitosan compounds (i.e. N-

carboxymethylchitosan-N,O-sulfate) have been found to inhibit the synthesis of virus-specific
proteins and the replication of HIV-1 in cultured T-cells as well as the replication of the
Rausher murine leukemia virus in cultured mouse fibroblasts

and chitosan itself

. Additionally 6-deoxy-6-

have been reported to have antiviral

activity via a variety of mechanisms. It is well known that quaternary ammonium compounds
(QACs) are viricidal due to mechanisms involving virion degradation and nucleic acid binding

.

However WO2013/172725

reports that N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium

, and a level of quaternary ammonium groups ranging from 57% to

, inhibits coronavirus infections (e.g. HCoV-NL63) in vitro by a mechanism that

involves an inhibition of viral entry into the cell 31. Positively charged HTCC was shown to
electrostatically bind the coronaviral S proteins, blocking its interaction with the entry receptor
and consequently the virus replication

30-32

. Such activity was shown for several members of

the Coronaviridae family and HTCC also inhibited entry of highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2
and MERS-CoV into cells 33. The HTCC variant effective for the SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively
high molecular weight (50 - 190 kDa)

substitution (57 – 77mole%) 33 and has not been through a GLP toxicology screen.

Here we show that a different quaternary ammonium chitosan (N-palmitoyl-N-monomethylN,N-dimethyl-N,N,N-trimethyl-6-O-glycolchitosan – GCPQ 6, Figure 1), with a 6-O-glycol
group (lacking in HTCC), a hydrophobic acyl group (lacking in both HTCC and HM-HTCC;
the latter derivatised with N-dodecyl groups), a lower molecular weight (10 – 30 kDa) than
HTCC, a trimethyl quaternary ammonium group directly in place of the C2 amine group in
chitosan, unlike HTCC (which has the hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium group attached to
the C2 nitrogen), and a lower level of quaternary ammonium substitution than HTCC (less than
40 mole%) is also able to inhibit viral entry into cells. Oligochitosans without the quaternary
ammonium group were inactive in inhibiting coronavirus entry into cells

30

. However the

quaternary ammonium group on HTCC is not the only structural requirement for activity, as
many quaternary ammonium polymers were found to be inactive in inhibiting coronavirus
entry into cells 30. Furthermore HTCC was inactive in inhibiting a number of other viruses
(e.g. human herpes virus 1, influenza A, adenoviruses and enteroviruses) 30. Molecular weight
determinants of activity are also unclear, as while high molecular weight HTCCs (50 - 190
kDa)

29,30

were active against coronaviruses, chitosans of molecular weight 5 – 17 kDa were

more effective antiviral agents against tobacco mosaic virus in Xanthi-nk tobacco leaves (viral
inhibition of 58 – 87%) than chitosans with a molecular weight of 130 kDa and above 25. It is
thus clear that it is not straightforward to define the polymer structure features that will inhibit
coronaviruses in cells, or indeed inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses.
We decided to study GCPQ’s anti-viral properties, as crucially, GCPQ is being developed as a
pharmaceutical excipient and has been through a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology
screen 6-9,34,35, with Investigational New Drug enabling studies currently ongoing and funded
by the US National Institute of Health National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences
(NCATS). The existing GCPQ safety data and the anti-viral activity, reported here, strongly
favour the clinical testing of GCPQ as an anti-viral nasal spray.

Methods
Tissue culture
The cytotoxicity of compounds was assessed by incubating confluent monolayers of Vero E6
and A549ACE2+ cells with a range of GCPQ compound concentrations. The XTT assay was
carried out 48 hours later, according to the manufacturer’s protocol using 200,000 cells per
well and DMEM supplemented with foetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin (please
see above under materials).
The ability of each compound to inhibit the virus replication was determined by infecting
confluent Vero E6 and A549ACE2+ monolayers with the SARS-CoV-2 virus at 400 TCID50/mL
in the presence of test compounds or phosphate buffered saline - PBS (TCID50 = 50% Tissue
Culture Infectious Dose). Mock controls (cell lysate without the virus) and medium
(supplemented DMEM – please see above) controls were included. Each compound was
present during and after the infection. The cells were then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C and
5% CO2. Afterward, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and each compound was reapplied onto the cell monolayer. 100μL of the cell culture supernatants were subsequently
collected from each designated well after two days of culture. The experiments were carried
out in triplicate.
Virus replication inhibition in HAE was evaluated by infecting MucilAir™ (Epithelics Sarl,
Switzerland) with SARS-CoV-2 virus at 5000 TCID50/mL in the presence of GCPQa or PBS.

GCPQa diluted in PBS was added to the apical side of the insert (200 μg/ml or 500 μg/ml) and
incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes before the infection. After the pre-incubation was completed,
the compound was removed and fresh dilutions of the compound with the virus were added
and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Next, the apical side of the HAE was washed thrice with
PBS and each compound was re-applied and incubated again for 30 minutes at 37°C. After the
last incubation with the GCPQ, the samples (50 μL) were collected and the HAE cultures were
left in air-liquid interphase. Every 24 hours the HAE apical surface was incubated for
30 minutes with the GCPQ or PBS and the samples were collected for virus yield evaluation.
Viral RNA was isolated from the apical washings or cell culture supernatant, RNA was isolated
(Viral DNA/RNA; A&A Biotechnology, Poland), reverse-transcribed into cDNA (High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit; ThermoScientific, Poland), and subjected to the
qPCR analysis. Briefly, cDNA was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 1 × qPCR
Master Mix (A&A Biotechnology, Poland), in the presence of probe (100nM) and primers
(450nM each), sequences provided in Table 1.
The reaction was carried out using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR machine (Life Technologies,
Poland) according to the scheme: 2 min at 50°C and 10 min at 92°C, followed by 40 cycles of
15 s at 92°C and 1 min at 60°C. In order to assess the copy number for N gene, DNA standards
were prepared, as described before 36. The obtained data is presented as virus yield and as the
log removal value (LRV), showing the relative decrease in the amount of virus in cell culture
media compared to the control.
Intranasal Delivery in a Healthy Animal Model
GCPQ (molecular weight = 10 kDa, mole% palmitoyl groups = 16 and mole% quaternary
ammonium groups = 13) was radiolabelled using a two stage strategy: first an acylating reagent
[N-succinimidyl-3[4-hydroxyphenyl]propionate - the Bolton and Hunter reagent (BH)] was
initially covalently coupled to GCPQ and then the GCPQ-BH complex was iodinated with 125I.

Briefly, GCPQ (90 mg) was dissolved in DMSO (3 mL). To this solution was added 200 µL
of triethylamine and 0.05 molar equivalents (10 mg) of BH reagent and the reaction allowed to
proceed overnight at room temperature with stirring. The next day, the GCPQ-BH conjugate
was precipitated using an acetone: diethyl ether mixture (1:2, v/v) and the pellet was wash 3
times with the same acetone: diethyl ether mixture. The washed pellet was dissolved in
methanol (2 mL) and dialyzed against water overnight. The dialysed GCPQ-BH was then
freeze dried and collected. Labelling of GCPQ-BH with

125

I was performed using iodination

beads ® (Thermo Scientific Pierce, UK). Briefly, GCPQ-BH (20 mg) and 100 mg GCPQ were
dissolved in methanol with stirring then the methanol was removed under vacuum and TrisHCL buffer (25 mM, pH 4.8, 1.8 mL) was added to the dry film to produce a final concentration
of 66.7 mg/mL. This solution was then added to a tube containing the I125 (1 mCi, 17 Ci/mg,
0.392 nmol, Perkin-Elmer, USA) and four iodination beads® (Thermo Scientific Pierce, UK).
The reaction was incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature, after which the reaction was
terminated by separating the solution from beads.

PD Spin Trap G-25 Columns (GE

Healthcare Life Sciences, UK), that are prepared by vortexing and discarding of the eluting
storage buffer by centrifuging (2800 rpm for 1 min), were used in order to remove the free
iodine (with the free iodine removed through the addition of 50 μL of the reaction per column
and centrifuging at 2,800 rpm for 2 min). The eluent was placed in Amicon ultra centrifugal
filters (3 kDa, Millipore, USA) with 200 μL H2O, and was subject to repeated washes (through
centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 min), until the washed out water produced negligible counts.
All animal experiments were performed under a UK Home Office licence and were approved
by the local ethics committee. A Male Balb/C mouse weighing 25 g (Charles River, UK),
allowed free access to standard rodent chow and water, was intranasally administered
radiolabelled GCPQ-BH (10 mg/kg, 1.2 MBq) by using a pipette to place 5uL of the
radiolabelled material into the mouse nares and allowing the mouse to sniff in the dose. At

various time points after the administration of the radiolabelled GCPQ-BH, animals were
anaesthetised using isofluorane (1-2% in oxygen), maintained at 37 ºC and submitted for
NanoSPECT/CT analysis (Mediso, USA).
In vivo SPECT/CT Imaging and Analysis
SPECT/CT scans of the mouse head at 30 min, 2h 30 min and 24 h after nasal administration
were acquired using a NanoSPECT/CT scanner (Mediso, Hungary). The mouse was
anaesthetised using isofluorane (1-2% in oxygen) and maintained at 37ºC. SPECT images
were obtained over 30 minutes using a 4-head scanner with nine 1.4 mm pinhole apertures in
helical scan mode with a time per view of 60 seconds. CT images were subsequently acquired
using a 45 kilo volt peak (kVp) X-ray source, 500 ms exposure time in 180 projections, a pitch
of 0.5 with an acquisition time of 4:30 minutes. Body temperature was maintained by a warm
air blower and the respiration and core body temperature was monitored throughout. CT images
were reconstructed using Bioscan InVivoScope (Bioscan, USA) software in voxel size 124 ×
124 × 124 μm, whereas SPECT images were reconstructed using HiSPECT (ScivisGmbH,
Bioscan) in a 256 × 256 matrix. Images were fused and analysed using VivoQuant (Invicro, A
Konica Minolta Company) software. 3D Regions of Interest (ROIs) were created for the uptake
within the nares for each time point and the activity calculated as the percentage of
administered dose. Representative images are scaled the same (same min and max). After the
final scan the mouse was sacrificed and the entire head of the mouse analysed using a curimeter
(Capintech, Mirion Technologies, UK) for ex vivo validation of 125I concentration.

Results
Cytotoxicity
Four GCPQ polymers (see Table 2) were tested. First, the cytotoxicity of polymers was
analysed on Vero E6 and A549ACE2+ cells. The results of the analysis are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Cytotoxicity of GCPQs in vitro. Cell viability was assessed using an XTT assay on Vero E6 cells (A)
and A549ACE2+ cells (B). Relative viability of cells (percentage of the untreated control) is shown on y-axis. All
assays were performed in triplicate, and average values with standard errors are presented. The letters a to d refer
to the GCPQs shown in Table 2.

For the virus assays, only non-toxic concentrations were tested: 10 μg/ml of GCPQa, 25 μg/ml
for GCPQc, and 200 μg/ml for GCPQb and GCPQd.

Anti-viral activity in Vero E6 and A549 cells
The anti-viral activity of GPCQs was analysed on Vero E6 and A549ACE2+ cells. Each analysis
was performed in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. The results are presented
in Figure 3. The assay showed inhibition of SARS-CoV2 replication in the presence of GCPQa
and GCPQc at non-toxic concentrations.

Figure 3: Anti-viral activity of GCPQs against SARS-CoV-2. Virus replication was evaluated using RT-qPCR.
The data are presented as a number of RNA copies per mL of the original sample (left) or as Log Removal Value
(LRV) compared to untreated samples (right). Non-toxic concentrations were tested (10 μg/ml of GCPQa, 25
μg/ml for GCPQc, and 200 μg/ml for GCPQb and GCPQd). The assay was performed in triplicate, and average
values with standard errors are presented. For the RNA copies per mL data GCPQa and GCPQc are significantly
different from PBS treated cells (p < 0.0001) and for the log removal value, GCPQa is significantly different from
PBS treated samples in the A549 and Vero E6 cell lines (p < 0.05).

Our analysis demonstrated that GCPQa and GCPQc effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication in vitro at non-toxic concentrations. GCPQa showed the highest toxicity, but at the
same time highest anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential (~4 logs decrease in viral load at 10 μg/mL).
Viral inhibition in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells
The effectiveness of GCPQ in the artificial cell culture systems has its drawbacks and for that
reason it is of importance to validate the observations in more complex systems that replicate
the host-pathogen interactions. For example, we have observed lack of toxicity in vivo at much

higher concentrations 7, while the immortalized cell lines were susceptible even at low
micromolar concentrations. This most likely results from the effect of the charged polymers on
the cell adhesion to the plastic, which is not relevant in the tissue. Furthermore, chitosan and
its derivatives were shown to carry strong antineoplastic properties, and these properties may
affect the cell viability in culture.
To better validate our observation on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of GPCQa, a fully
differentiated HAE ex vivo model was used, reconstituting ex vivo the human respiratory
epithelium. Two different concentrations of GPCQa were evaluated (200 μg/mL and 500
μg/mL) and PBS was used as a control. Each analysis was performed in triplicate and the results
are shown in Figure 4.

are presented. At the 48 and 72 hour time points, GCPQa at 500 µg/ mL is significantly different from PBS

The results show that GCPQa inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in the HAE ex vivo model. A
lower viral yield was detected in the cultures treated with GCPQa than in the control cultures
treated with PBS after 72 h of infection.

Nasal Delivery
The intranasal delivery of GCPQ to mouse nares resulted in the polymer being detectable
within the nares area of the mouse head up to 24 hours after dosing as would be expected since
the polymer is mucoadhesive 9. 3D ROI’s of the GCPQ uptake on SPECT images indicated
that directly after administration (30 min) 28.22% of the administered dose was found to be
within the nares, after 2h 30 min this had reduced slightly to 25.13% of the administered dose
and at 24 h, 13.13% of the administered dose was found to be retained in the nares. Ex vivo
curimeter analysis of the mouse head at 24 h, also confirmed that 13.5% of the administered
dose was still present in the mouse head, which is slightly higher than that obtained by SPECT,
but is reflective of the radioactivity within the whole head and not just the nares area.

Discussion
Here we introduce GCPQ, a low molecular weight chitosan derivative with features that
unexpectedly confer anti-viral activity. GPCQ is being developed as a pharmaceutical
excipient, has been through a GLP toxicology screen and a no observed adverse effect level
(NOAEL) determined for a 28 day repeat dose in the rat (18 mg/ kg) 7. It is the key excipient
in the enkephalin pain therapeutic being developed by NCATS. Human nasal concentrations
in excess of 1mg/ mL will be obtained by dosing 1mg in each nare, a dose of 0.03 mg/ kg that
is 600 fold lower than the NOAEL dose. A low molecular weight clearly promotes activity
against SARS-COV-2 in mammalian cells (Table 2 and Figures 3 - 4) and this is correlated
with the ease with which this polymer may be incorporated into aqueous media. Glycol
chitosans of molecular weights 40 kDa and 100 kDa were not active (data not shown),
demonstrating that quaternary ammonium and possibly palmitoyl groups are important
determinants of activity. We speculate that GCPQ acts by binding to the virus via electrostatic
interactions in a similar manner to HTCC 30-32.
GCPQ possesses some advantages for use in viral inhibition and specifically the clinical
prevention of viral infections as GCPQ is mucoadhesive 9, has a long residence time in the
nares (Figure 5) and is chemically stable for at least 18 months 6. GCPQ also self assembles
into nanoparticles and these nanoparticles may be clustered into microparticles for nasal
delivery 7, as required by the regulator

37

. We hypothesise that GCPQ could be used as a

molecular mask nasal spray for the prevention of coronavirus infections. The new data
showing that SARS-COV-2’s neurological symptoms (such as loss of smell and taste,
headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting in more than one-third of individuals and impaired
consciousness) is correlated with the entry of SARS-COV-2 into the brain via the olfactory
neurons, due to presence of the virus in the nasal cavity 38, means that local interventions, such

as with GCPQ that limit viral cell entry in the nasal cavity could have a profound impact on
the course and severity of the disease.
The potential applicability of GCPQ in the prevention of viral infections is supported by the
fact that carrageenans (anionic sulphated carbohydrates) have been shown to reduce the
duration of disease (reduced by 3 days) in influenza and common cold patients (reduced the
number of relapses over a 21 day period by three times) and prevent influenza A viral infections
in mice, acting by preventing viral interaction with relevant cell surface receptors 39,40.
As GCPQ’s activity is not predicated specifically on the recognition of particular epitopes but
appears to be based on electrostatic interactions between GCPQ and the virus, it is possible
that GCPQ may be applied to a wide variety of viral infections. These advantages mean that
GCPQ may be given as a nasal spray or by other means for the prevention and treatment of
specific viral infections.
Conclusions
A mucoadhesive polymer with anti-SARS-COV-2 activity is presented. The polymer may be
used as a nasal spray to prevent SARS-COV-2 infections.
