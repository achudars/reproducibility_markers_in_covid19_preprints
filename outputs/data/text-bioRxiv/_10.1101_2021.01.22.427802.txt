Abstract (116, max 150)

27
28

Virus propagation methods generally use transformed cell lines to grow viruses from clinical

29

specimens, which may force viruses to rapidly adapt to cell culture conditions, a process

30

facilitated by high viral mutation rates. Upon propagation in VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 may

31

mutate or delete the multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the spike protein that facilitates

32

serine protease-mediated entry into human airway cells. We report that propagating SARS-

33

CoV-2 on the human airway cell line Calu-3 - that expresses serine proteases - prevents

34

MBCS mutations. Similar results were obtained using a human airway organoid-based

35

culture system for SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Thus, in-depth knowledge on the biology of a

36

virus can be used to establish methods to prevent cell culture adaptation.

Introduction

39
40

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the

41

ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 emerged late 2019 in China

42

and had spread globally within a few months (Zhu et al., 2020). An unprecedented rapid

43

vaccine development response has led to approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines at the end

44

of 2020. Conversely, the quest for efficacious specific antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2

45

was not successful. The lack of antivirals, the high adaptive capacity of the virus, and the

46

emergence of new strains, indicate that further research on SARS-CoV-2 biology is

47

necessary.

49

The first step in most SARS-CoV-2 laboratory studies is in vitro virus propagation to obtain

50

highly concentrated virus stocks. Despite recent advances in physiologically relevant in vitro

51

cell culture systems, methods to propagate clinical isolates have not changed since the first

52

cell lines were established. Traditionally, virus propagation relies on transformed cell lines

53

to produce progeny viruses after inoculation of these cells with a clinical specimen

54

containing the virus. The most widely used cell line in virology is the Vero cell line, which is

55

derived from the kidney of an African green monkey. This cell line and its derivatives (e.g.

56

VeroE6, Vero118, etc) contain genomic deletions of genes involved in the antiviral

57

interferon response (Osada et al., 2014). Such mutations are common in transformed cell

58

lines and allow unbridled virus replication, facilitating the production of high titer virus

59

stocks and allowing research on a wide range of viruses. These isolated viruses are often

60

adapted to their cell culture systems due to their high mutation rates. The development of

61

first and next generation sequencing methods revealed that these adapted viruses were

62

heavily mutated and had drifted significantly from their natural counterparts (Alfson et al.,

63

2018; Lau et al., 2020; Sutter & Moss, 1992; Tamura et al., 2013; H. Wei et al., 2017). Cell

64

culture adaptive mutations often affect viruses phenotypically, both in vitro and in vivo.

65
66

Coronavirus replication is initiated when the viral spike protein binds to the entry receptor

67

on the cell and fuses viral and cellular membranes, allowing the viral RNA to enter the

68

cytoplasm (Hulswit, de Haan, & Bosch, 2016). The spike protein is composed of two

69

domains, the S1 receptor binding domain and the S2 fusion domain, which are separated by

70

the S1/S2 cleavage site. Proteolytic cleavage at the S1/S2 site and the more C-terminal S2â€™

71

site is required for coronavirus infectivity as this turns on the fusogenic activity of the S2

72

domain (Millet & Whittaker, 2015). A distinctive feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.22.427802; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this

73

specific S1/S2 cleavage site in the viral spike protein (Coutard et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2

74

S1/S2 cleavage site contains three basic arginines interrupted by a non-polar alanine (RRAR)

75

and is therefore referred to as a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS). This feature is remarkable

76

as all other viruses within the clade of SARS-related viruses, including SARS-CoV, lack a PRRA

77

insertion that creates this multibasic cleavage site, leading to speculations on whether this

78

site is essential for efficient replication in the human respiratory tract (Hoffmann, Kleine-

79

Weber, & Pohlmann, 2020). Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 isolates that are cultured in the lab

80

rapidly obtain mutations or deletions in the MBCS (Davidson et al., 2020; Klimstra et al.,

81

2020; Lau et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Ogando et al., 2020). On VeroE6 cells, these mutated

82

viruses have a large plaque phenotype, grow to higher titers and outcompete the wildtype

83

virus within 1-4 passages. These mutations have rarely been observed in human clinical

84

specimens (Liu et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020) and purified MBCS mutants do not efficiently

85

replicate in hamsters (Johnson et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020). We have recently shown that

86

the MBCS is not required for entry into VeroE6 cells, but is essential for entry into human

87

airway organoids (Mykytyn et al., 2021). We also reported that the MBCS facilitated plasma

88

membrane serine protease-mediated entry, whereas it decreased the dependency on

89

endosomal cathepsins for entry. The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, but not a

90

cathepsin inhibitor, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry in human airway organoids,

91

whereas the opposite was observed in VeroE6 cells. These findings demonstrate that SARS-

92

CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases but not cathepsins, and suggest

93

that the multibasic cleavage site is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy. The loss of the

94

MBCS may be an adaptation to the cathepsin-mediated entry pathway present in VeroE6

95

cells.

97

In this study, we investigated whether mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS could be

98

prevented in a human airway cell line (Calu-3) and 2D air-liquid interface (ALI) airway

99

organoids in which SARS-CoV-2 enters using serine proteases.

Results

102
103

SARS-CoV-2 isolates that are cultured in the lab rapidly lose their spike MBCS (Davidson et

104

al., 2020; Klimstra et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Ogando et al., 2020).To

105

investigate the extent of cell culture adaptation in our SARS-CoV-2 stocks, we deep-

106

sequenced passage 2, 3 and 4 stocks (P2, P3 and P4) of the BavPat-1 or Munich-1 strain

107

propagated on VeroE6 cells. These stocks were produced from a P1 virus stock grown on

108

VeroE6 cells (Fig S1A). In the P2 stock, the majority of reads (65.3%) in the MBCS were

109

identical to the WT sequence (Fig 1A). In the multibasic RxxR motif both the first (R682L)

110

and the last (R685H) arginine were mutated in 3.5% and 6.1% of reads, respectively. An

111

additional mutation (S686G) directly C-terminal to the MBCS was detected at 25.1%. As this

112

variant increased during passaging and therefore could be an adaptation to cell culture, we

113

included it in our analyses. The P3 stock contained 18.8% wild type (WT) viruses and the

114

S686G was the major MBCS variant at 45.4% while mutations R685H and R682L were

115

present at 22.4% and 7.3%, respectively. A deletion (Del679-688) of the entire MBCS was

116

found as well at 6.1% (Fig 1B). In the P4 virus, the dominant variant contained the R685H

117

mutation at 33.4%, while the Del679-688 and R682L increased to 13.9% and 10.4%,

118

respectively. In the P4 virus, only 9% of reads were WT. Despite the strikingly low level of

119

WT viruses in the VeroE6 stocks, the predominant cleavage motif for the P2 and P3 was still

120

RRARS since mutations never co-occurred (Fig 1A-C). Our results show that a thorough

121

analysis of deep-sequencing data is required to critically assess culture adaptation. The

122

observations from deep sequencing data were consistent with Sanger sequencing analysis

123

(Fig 1D-F). In agreement with the mixed population of wildtype (WT) and mutant viruses, we

124

observed small (non-adapted) and large (cell culture adapted) plaque phenotypes in a

125

plaque assay for the P2 virus, but plaques increased in size during passaging (Fig 1G).

126
127

Whereas the MBCS mutations directly removed arginines (R682L, R685H and the deletion)

128

from the minimal RxxR furin motif, the most common stock mutation was the S686G. This

129

site lies directly C-terminal from the MBCS at positions 682-685, indicating that it may also

130

affect the MBCS functionally. To test this, we assessed the infectivity of the 686 mutation

131

using vesicular stomatitis virus- (VSV) based pseudoviruses expressing a green fluorescent

132

protein (GFP) as described before (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Western blot analysis of cleaved

133

and uncleaved S1 revealed that proteolytic cleavage was observed for the WT SARS-CoV-2

134

pseudovirus and abrogated by all MBCS mutations tested (del-PRRA, del-RRAR, R682A,

135

R685A and R685H) (Fig 2A, B). For the S686G mutation ~10% cleaved S1 was observed,

136

whereas this was ~80% for WT S (Fig 2A, B). The same difference in cleavage between WT

137

and S686G pseudoviruses was observed for S2 (Fig 2C, D). As expected based on earlier

138

work (Mykytyn et al., 2021), SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with MBCS mutations were more

139

infectious on VeroE6 cells and less infectious on Calu-3 cells (Fig 3A-C). A similar trend was

140

observed for the S686G mutant spike. The infectivity on VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells was similar

141

for all spikes tested but the WT spike benefited more from TMPRSS2 expression (Fig 3D-E).

142

Protease inhibitors camostat and E64D were then used to block serine proteases and

143

cathepsins, respectively, to assess how spike mutations affect the route of entry. The stable

144

expression of TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells leads to entry of WT pseudoviruses via this protease

145

instead of cathepsin-mediated entry, but SARS-CoV-2 MBCS mutants and to a lesser extent

146

the S686G mutant retained partial cathepsin mediated entry (Fig 3F-I). In addition, a GFP-

147

complementation fusion assay, in which cell-cell fusion occurs at the plasma membrane,

148

showed that MBCS mutations and to a lesser extent the S686G mutation abrogated fusion in

149

VeroE6, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells (Fig 4A-C). These data explain why VeroE6-

150

propagated SARS-CoV-2 stocks rapidly accumulate mutations in the MBCS and at spike

151

position 686. Despite being outside of the MBCS, the S686G mutation impairs spike

152

cleavage, cell-cell fusion and serine protease usage, but not as dramatically as the MBCS

153

mutations or deletions. The low infectivity of MBCS mutants and the S686G mutant on Calu-

154

3 cells indicates that WT viruses could have a selective advantage in these cells.

155
156

In order to establish culture conditions in which SARS-CoV-2 is genetically stable, we tested

157

whether WT viruses would have a selective advantage on Calu-3 cells that possess serine

158

protease mediated entry and little cathepsin-mediated entry (Mykytyn et al., 2021). For

159

these experiments we first produced a Calu-3 P2 virus from the VeroE6 P1 stock (Fig 5A).

160

This stock was 100% WT in the MBCS and no major variants (>50%) were detected in the

161

rest of the genome (Fig S5C). An additional round of passaging on Calu-3 cells did not lead to

162

any MBCS mutations, or mutations elsewhere (Fig 5B, Fig S5C). A Calu-3 P3 from a VeroE6

163

P2 virus did still contain the S686G at low frequency (7.4%) (Fig 5C), but continued passaging

164

to P5 completely removed the S686G (Fig 5D). Again, we did not observe any other major

165

variant mutations in the rest of the genome (Fig S5C). We also produced Calu-3 P4 virus

166

from a VeroE6 P3 stock and we show that while this Calu-3 P4 virus had lost all MBCS

167

mutations, the S686G mutation remained at a frequency of 65.7% (Fig S5A). The addition of

168

E64D to block any cathepsin-mediated entry decreased the frequency of S686G by ~11%, to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.22.427802; this version posted January 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this

169

54.3%, but did not remove S686G entirely (Fig S5B). These results support our earlier

170

findings (Fig 2; Fig 3; Fig 4) that the S686G is a less severe cell culture adaptation compared

171

with MBCS mutations, and more importantly show that Calu-3 cells can be used to grow

172

genetically stable stocks without MBCS mutations or S686G. Additionally, stocks grown on

173

Calu-3 cells reached titers of 1.47 x 106 - 2.1 x 107 TCID50/ml, indicating that Calu-3 cells

174

support the production of high titer stocks.

175
176

To confirm that serine proteases are responsible for the reversal of cell culture adaptation

177

observed in Calu-3 cells, we passaged the adapted VeroE6 P3 stock (Fig 1B) on regular

178

VeroE6 cells or VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells. P4 viruses grown on VeroE6 cells were only 9% WT

179

and R685H was the dominant variant at 33.4% (Fig 6A; redisplay of Fig 1C). R682L and

180

Del679-688 were present at 10.4% and 13.9%, respectively. Propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in

181

VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells resulted in an increase in the frequency of wildtype viruses at 21.7%

182

and a decrease in the frequency of MBCS mutations (7.9% R685H; 4.2% R682L; 1.5% Del679-

183

688), but the S686G remained at 64.6% (Fig 6C). The addition of the serine protease

184

inhibitor camostat (10Î¼M) to the VeroE6-TMPRSS2 culture, but not the VeroE6 culture (Fig

185

6B), increased the frequency of MBCS mutations (36.6% R685H; 13% R682L; 8.8% Del679-

186

688), confirming that serine proteases prevent cell culture adaptation (Fig 6D). As TMPRSS2

187

expression prevented MBCS mutations, we tested whether the addition of trypsin (0.7Î¼g/ml

188

TPCK-Trypsin) would have a similar effect. Surprisingly, the addition of trypsin to VeroE6

189

cells, but not VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells, led to deletion of the entire MBCS (Fig S6A, C). This

190

deletion may arise due to the complete cleavage (S1/S2 and S2â€™) of virus particles that are

191

not bound to the cellular membranes, which would inactivate them. Cell surface expressed

192

TMPRSS2 could accelerate TMPRSS2-mediated entry and cell-cell spread, reducing the

193

chance of trypsin cleavage in the supernatant. Additionally, we tested whether the addition

194

of fetal bovine serum (FBS, heat-inactivated, 10% final concentration) affected culture

195

adaptation as this is commonly added when producing viral stocks. FBS had a similar effect

196

to trypsin in the VeroE6, but not the VeroE6-TMPRSS2 culture, indicating that proteases

197

capable of cleaving spike may be present in serum and that FBS should be avoided when

198

propagating SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S6B, D).

199
200

Next, we hypothesized that the best way to prevent cell culture adaptation would be to

201

propagate the virus in non-transformed human airway cells. Recent advances in stem cell

202

biology have enabled the establishment of human organoid culture systems (Katsura et al.,

203

2020; Nikolic et al., 2017; Sachs et al., 2019; Salahudeen et al., 2020; Sato et al., 2009; Youk

204

et al., 2020). These organoid cultures consist of stem cells that self-renew, allowing

205

prolonged passaging and expansion, but can also differentiate to mature cell types, such as

206

ciliated cells, goblet cells and club cells. Organoids of the airways, the alveoli, and the

207

intestine have recently been used by us to study SARS-CoV-2 entry and pathogenesis

208

(Katsura et al., 2020; Lamers, Beumer, et al., 2020; Lamers, van der Vaart, et al., 2020;

209

Mykytyn et al., 2021; Salahudeen et al., 2020; Youk et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).

210

Pseudoviruses containing MBCS mutations infected human airway organoids poorly

211

(Mykytyn et al., 2021), indicating that these mutations could be prevented by virus

212

propagation in these cells. To produce stocks in human airway organoids, we differentiated

213

the organoids at 2D in transwell inserts at air-liquid interface for twelve weeks as described

214

before (Fig 7A) (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Apical cells, including ciliated cells, in these cultures

215

expressed TMPRSS2 as shown by immunohistochemistry (Fig 7B). To produce viral stocks,

216

2D airway organoids were inoculated at the apical side at a MOI of 0.05 using the VeroE6 P2

217

stock (Fig 1A). After a two-hour incubation, cells were washed three times to remove

218

unbound particles. On day two to five post-infection, apical washes were collected and

219

stored at 4Â°C. During virus collections, bound virus particles were released from cells by

220

pipetting directly on the cell layer. Virus collections from day two and day three (d2+3), and

221

day four and day five (d4+5) were pooled, centrifuged, and filtered to remove debris, dead

222

cells and mucus. In these cultures, ciliated cells were infected, as shown by confocal imaging

223

at day three post infection (Fig 7C). At day five, cultures exhibited widespread infection (Fig

224

7D) and significant cytopathic effects including loss of ciliated cells (Fig 7D-E) and syncytium

225

formation (Fig 7E). To remove cytokines that could interfere in downstream experiments

226

(such as interferons), we exchanged the medium in the filtered virus collections three times

227

using an Amicon Ultra-15 column (100 kDa cutoff). The resulting titers from the d2+3 and

228

d4+5 stocks were 5.64 x 105 and 1.00 x 107 TCID50/ml, respectively, indicating that high titer

229

virus stocks can be made in human airway organoids. Sequencing demonstrated that the

230

high titer organoid stock (d4+5) had a 98.9% WT spike sequence, without multibasic

231

cleavage site mutations and the S686G mutation at only 1.1% (Fig 8A-B). In accordance, the

232

Organoid P3 virus produced small plaques (Fig 8C). No major variants were detected in the

233

rest of the genome (Fig 8D). Next, we investigated S1/S2 cleavage of the VeroE6 P2, P3,

234

Calu-3 P3 and Organoid P3 virus stocks by immunoblot (Fig 8E). The non-adapted Calu-3 and

235

organoid stocks were >85% cleaved, while the VeroE6 P2 and P3 stocks were 71.2% and 33%

236

cleaved, respectively (Figure 8F). The findings support that the Calu-3 and organoid stocks

237

are non-adapted and indicate that in vivo the S1/S2 cleavage takes place in the producing

238

cell.

241
242

The rapid loss of the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS in cell culture has underlined that some in vitro

243

propagation systems may fail to model key aspects of the viral life cycle. As these mutations

244

directly affect the relevance and translatability of all laboratory SARS-CoV-2 experiments, it

245

is pivotal to sort out exactly why these occur in order to prevent them. We and others have

246

previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS enhances serine protease-mediated entry,

247

the dominant entry pathway in human airway cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Mykytyn et al.,

248

2021). VeroE6 cells, commonly used in the lab to grow virus stocks, lack this entry pathway,

249

forcing the virus to use endosomal cathepsins for entry. This led us to hypothesize that

250

mutations in the MBCS could be prevented in cells with an active serine protease-mediated

251

entry pathway. In this study, we show that the ectopic expression of the serine protease

252

TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells prevented MBCS mutations. Virus propagation in Calu-3 cells,

253

which naturally express serine proteases, also prevented cell culture adaptation. Similar

254

results were obtained using a human airway organoid-based culture system for SARS-CoV-2

255

propagation

256
257

Our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts to VeroE6 cell culture. Therefore, deep-

258

sequencing of viral stocks, which offers a thorough analysis beyond the consensus

259

sequence, is essential. As none of the MBCS mutations co-occurred, consensus sequence

260

logos of culture adapted stocks were often WT, while actually only 10-20% of viral reads

261

contained the WT sequence. Therefore, besides reporting the consensus sequence SARS-

262

CoV-2 studies should preferably also report the percentage of WT reads in the MBCS. The

263

first adaptation to occur in our stocks was the S686G mutation, which lies directly adjacent

264

to the MBCS and decreased Calu-3 infectivity, fusogenicity and S1/S2 cleavage, but not as

265

severely as MBCS mutations. Interestingly, this mutation is rapidly positively selected in

266

ferrets (Richard et al., 2020), and also transmitted, suggesting that there are key differences

267

in transmission between humans and ferrets. Alternatively, it is possible that S686G

268

optimizes cleavage by a specific ferret protease.

269
270

SARS-CoV-2 is generally grown on VeroE6 cells in the presence of 1-10% FBS, as this allows

271

the production of highly concentrated virus stocks. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly

272

acquired mutations in the MBCS upon passaging in VeroE6 cells and that the addition of FBS

273

increases the frequency of MBCS mutations. Currently, we do not know which components

274

of FBS lead to the increased rate of cell culture adaptation, but we hypothesize that (serine)

275

proteases, naturally present in serum (Shimomura, Ochiai, Kondo, & Morimoto, 1992) may

276

be responsible as the addition of trypsin dramatically increased the frequency of MBCS

277

mutations and even led to the deletion of the entire MBCS. The observation that the MBCS

278

is a disadvantage in the presence of trypsin indicates that S2â€™ proteolytic cleavage

279

(performed by trypsin (Hoffmann et al., 2020)) should not occur in the supernatant where it

280

would cause all spikes to shed their S1 and adopt their post fusion conformation prior to

281

encountering the plasma membrane. Alternatively, protease inhibitors in serum

282

(Gstraunthaler, 2003) may block transmembrane serine proteases. For these reasons the

283

use of serum should be avoided when producing virus stocks. The use of defined serum-free

284

media avoids the uncertainty that factors in serum affect the genetic stability of a virus and

285

increase experimental reproducibility due to variations in serum sources.

286
287

We show that the expression of the serine protease TMPRSS2 decreases the replicative

288

fitness of MBCS mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which can then be outcompeted by WT viruses.

289

This indicates that the MBCS is an adaptation to serine proteases and that the serine

290

protease-mediated entry pathway is used for entry in vivo. This is in agreement with our

291

earlier observations that SARS-CoV-2 enters using serine proteases on airway organoids

292

(Mykytyn et al., 2021) and that MBCS mutant pseudoviruses could not efficiently infect

293

these cells. Low infectivity of MBCS mutants on the airway cell line Calu-3 was also noted by

294

Hoffmann and colleagues (Hoffmann et al., 2020). In contrast, two CRISPR-based survival

295

screens recently identified several endosomal proteins, including cathepsin L, as essential

296

SARS-CoV-2 genes (Daniloski et al., 2021; J. Wei et al., 2020). As noted recently by Bailey &

297

Diamonds (2020), the identification of endosomal host factors as proviral in cell line-based

298

CRISPR screens requires validation in primary cells (Bailey & Diamond, 2021). Our

299

observation that WT viruses have a selective advantage in 2D airway organoids confirms

300

that the endosomal entry pathway is of little significance in relevant cells.

301
302

As new SARS-CoV-2 strains are emerging now and will continue to emerge for as long as

303

SARS-CoV-2 circulates in humans, there is a need to develop propagation systems that will

304

preserve genetic stability for any given SARS-CoV-2 mutant originating from a human

305

respiratory sample. The closer a culture system mimics the human respiratory tract the less

306

likely it is that a SARS-CoV-2 isolate will adapt. Therefore, we developed a human airway

307

organoid model for SARS-CoV-2 propagation (Figure supplement 8). This model allows high

308

titer SARS-CoV-2 production and was most successful in removing MBCS mutations. In the

309

future we expect that organoid-based systems are likely to replace transformed cell lines

310

when producing viral stocks. The self-renewing capacity of organoids allows labs to share

311

organoid lines, allowing a level of reproducibility similar to that of transformed cell lines.

312

Organoids can be grown from a wide range of organs and species to best model the in vivo

313

environment of a particular virus.

314
315

In conclusion, this study shows that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts to VeroE6 cell culture

316

propagation and that this can be prevented by using cell lines with an active serine

317

protease-mediated entry pathway (VeroE6-TMPRSS2 or Calu-3). Alternatively, a 2D airway

318

organoid-based cell culture model can be used for SARS-CoV-2 propagation if in the future

319

new variants emerge that are not genetically stable on Calu-3 cells. Our study also shows

320

that deep-sequencing rather than consensus sequencing of viral stocks is critical for

321

obtaining relevant and reproducible results in SARS-CoV-2 studies.

SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cell lines

337

SARS-CoV-2 (isolate BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; European Virus Archive Global #026V-

339

VeroE6, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 or Calu-3 cells, as indicated, in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco),

340

supplemented with HEPES, Glutamax, penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 IU/mL)

341

(AdDF+++) at 37Â°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Infections were performed at a

342

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and virus was harvested after 72 hours. The culture

343

supernatant was cleared by centrifugation and stored at âˆ’80Â°C. Calu-3 stocks were

344

additionally cleared using a 0.45 Î¼M low protein binding filter (Millipore) to remove mucus

345

debris produced by these cells and the medium was exchanged three times for Opti-MEM I

346

(1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco) using an Amicon Ultra-15 column (100 kDa cutoff). At the end of

347

each centrifugation step approximately 2 ml was left in the top compartment. After three

348

exchanges the purified virus was transferred to a new 50 ml tube and the Amicon Ultra-15

349

column was washed ten times by adding 1 ml Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco) to the

350

top compartment, pipetting up and down several times on the filter and adding each wash

351

to the tube containing the purified virus preparation. This step was repeated until the

352

volume in the purified virus stock was equal to the original volume of culture supernatant.

353

Purified virus was stored at -80Â°C in aliquots. Stock titers were determined by preparing 10-

354

fold serial dilutions in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco). One-hundred Âµl of each dilution

355

was added to monolayers of 2 Ã— 104 VeroE6 cells in the same medium in a 96-well plate.

356

Plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 5 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. The

357

TCID50 was calculated according to the method of Spearman & KÃ¤rber. All work with

358

infectious SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions

Cloning of SARS-CoV-2 S WT, del-PRRA, R685A and R685H constructs for pseudovirus

363

production and GFP-complementation fusion assay was performed as described before

(Mykytyn et al., 2021). Del-RRAR, R682A and S686G plasmids were generated by

Organoid culture and differentiation

368

Human airway stem cells were isolated and grown into organoids, and passaged as

369

described before (Lamers, Beumer, et al., 2020) using a protocol adapted from Sachs and

370

colleagues (2019). Adult lung tissue was obtained from residual, tumor-free, material

371

obtained at lung resection surgery for lung cancer. The Medical Ethical Committee of the

372

Erasmus MC Rotterdam granted permission for this study (METC 2012-512). Study

373

procedures were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and in compliance

374

with relevant Dutch laws and institutional guidelines. The tissues obtained were

375

anonymized and non-traceable to the donor. In this study we used organoids from one

376

donor, from which bronchial and bronchiolar organoids were grown. Differentiation of

377

human airway organoids at air-liquid interface was performed as described before (Lamers,

378

To produce stocks in human airway organoids, we differentiated the bronchial organoids in

transwell inserts at air-liquid interface for twelve weeks. A total of twelve 12 mm transwell

383

inserts were washed three times in AdDF+++ before inoculation at the apical side at a MOI

of 0.05. After a two-hour incubation, cells were washed three times with AdDF+++ to

385

remove unbound particles. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were washed by adding

386

500 ul AdDF+++ to the apical side of the cells and incubating at 37Â°C 5% CO2 for 30 min to

387

disperse the newly produced virus particles, facilitating the next round of infection. Next,

388

the medium was removed and discarded, as generally little virus is produced in the first 24

389

hours (Lamers et al., 2020). At day two to five post-infection, washes were collected and

390

stored at 4Â°C. During collections bound virus particles were removed from the cells by

391

pipetting three times directly on the cell layer after the 30 min incubation step at 37Â°C 5%

392

CO2. Virus collections from day two and day three (d2+3), and day four and day five (d4+5)

393

were pooled, mixed by pipetting, centrifuged at 4000 x g for 4 min, and filtered through a

394

0.45um low protein binding filter (Millipore) to remove debris, dead cells and mucus. To

395

remove cytokines that could interfere in downstream experiments (such as interferons), we

396

exchanged the medium in the filtered virus collections three times with Opti-MEM I (1X) +

397

GlutaMAX (Gibco) using an Amicon Ultra-15 column (100 kDa cutoff). At the end of each

398

centrifugation step approximately 2 ml was left in the top compartment. After three

399

exchanges, the purified virus was transferred to a new 50 ml tube and the Amicon Ultra-15

400

column was washed ten times by adding 1 ml Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco) to the

401

top compartment, pipetting up and down several times on the filter and adding each wash

402

to the tube containing the purified virus preparation, resulting in a total volume of ~12 ml.

403

Next, virus preparations were aliquoted in 500 Î¼l aliquots, stored at -80Â°C and thawed for

404

titrations on VeroE6 cells.

407

Pseudovirus production, infectivity and entry assays were performed as described before

408

(Mykytyn et al., 2021). Briefly, pseudoviruses expressing WT, MBCS mutant and S686G S

409

were titrated by preparing 10-fold serial dilutions in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco).

410

Thirty Âµl of each dilution was added to monolayers of 2 Ã— 104 VeroE6, VeroE6-TMPRSS2 or 8

411

Ã— 104 Calu-3 cells in the same medium in a 96-well plate. Titrations were performed in

412

triplicate. Plates were incubated at 37Â°C overnight and then scanned on the Amersham

413

Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (channel Cy2; resolution 10 Âµm; GE Healthcare). Entry routes

414

were determined by pre-treating monolayers of VeroE6 or VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells with a

415

concentration range of camostat mesylate (Sigma) or E64D (MedChemExpress) diluted in

416

Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco) for 2 hours prior to infection with 1 x 103 pseudovirus.

417

Plates were incubated at 37Â°C overnight and then scanned on the Amersham Typhoon

418

sucrose cushion (10% sucrose, 15 mM Trisâ€“HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) for 1.5 hours

425

at 20,000 x g at 4Â°C. Supernatant was decanted and pseudoviruses resuspended in Opti-

BiotechnologieBioLabs) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. A SARS-CoV-2 specific

505

multiplex PCR was performed as recently described (Oude Munnink et al., 2020). In short,

506

primers for 86 overlapping amplicons spanning the entire genome were designed using

507

primal scheme (http://primal.zibraproject.org/.). The amplicon length was set to 500 bp

508

with 75 bp overlap between the different amplicons. Amplicons were purified with 0.8x

509

AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and 100 ng of DNA was converted into paired-end

510

Illumina sequencing libraries using KAPA HyperPlus library preparation kit (Roche) with the

511

KAPA unique dual-indexed adapters (Roche), following the manufacturerâ€™s

512

recommendations. The barcode-labeled samples were pooled and analyzed on an Illumina

513

sequencer V3 MiSeq flowcell (2Ã—300 cycles).

differentiated at air-liquid interface for 4-12 weeks. Step 2. Differentiated cultures are

670

infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 and washed daily for 5 days. The washes from

671

day 2-5 are collected and stored at 4Â°C. Step 3. Virus collections are cleared by

672

centrifugation and filtered to remove debris larger than 0.45 Î¼m. Next, the medium is

673

exchanged three times using Amicon columns to remove cytokines and debris smaller than

674

100 kDa. Purified virus preparations are then stored at -80Â°C in aliquots. Step 4. Stocks can

675

be characterized using plaque assays, Sanger sequencing and deep-sequencing. Created

Figure 4. Multibasic cleavage site mutations and the adjacent serine residue (S686)
impair spike protein fusogenicity.
(A-C) Fusogenicity of wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike and spike mutants was assessed after 18
hours by measuring the sum of all GFP+ pixels per well in a GFP-complementation fusion
assay on VeroE6-GFP1-10 (A), VeroE6-TMPRSS2-GFP1-10 (B), and Calu-3-GFP1-10 (C)
cells. The experiment was performed in triplicate. A representative experiment from two
independent experiments is shown. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. *
indicates a significant difference compared to WT (P<0.05). Error bars indicate SD. EV =
empty vector. WT = wild type.

Figure 7. A 2D air-liquid interface human airway organoid model for SARS-CoV-2 propagation. (A) Human airway organoids were dissociated and plated onto 12 mm transwell
inserts. After an 8-12 week differentiation period at air-liquid interface cultures contained ciliated, non-ciliated and basal cells as shown on a hematoxylin-eosin stain. (B) Air-exposed cells,
but not basal cells, expressed the priming protease TMPRSS2 as shown by immunohistochemistry. (C) Immunofluorescent staining indicated that in these cultures, ciliated cells (acetylated
tubulin+ or AcTUB+ cells) were infected by SARS-CoV-2. (D and E) At 5 days post-infection,
whole-well confocal imaging indicated the infection was widespread (D) and cytopathic effects,
including cilia damage (D and E) and syncytial cells (E) were visible. Scale bars indicate 20Âµm
in A, B, C; 2mm in D; and 100Âµm in E.

Figure supplement 8. Schematic workflow for the production of SARS-CoV-2 stocks on
2D air-liquid interface differentiated airway organoids.

Step 1. 3D self-renewing airway organoids are grown from human lung tissue. Next, these are dissociated to single cells and differentiated at air-liquid interface for 4-12 weeks.
Step 2. Differentiated cultures are infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 and washed daily for 5
days. The washes from day 2-5 are collected and stored at 4Â°C.
Step 3. Virus collections are cleared by centrifugation and filtered to remove debris larger than 0.45 Î¼m.
Next, the medium is exchanged three times using Amicon columns to remove cytokines and debris
smaller than 100 kDa. Purified virus preparations are then stored at -80Â°C in aliquots.
Step 4. Stocks can be characterized using plaque assays, Sanger sequencing and deep-sequencing.
