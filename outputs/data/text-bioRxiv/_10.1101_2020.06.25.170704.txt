Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing an
outbreak of COVID-19 globally in the past six months. A relatively higher divergence on the spike
protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe
that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 highquality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed
their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and
human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show
SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a
recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect
humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the directbinding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus
evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615)
were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different
populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the
early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2
transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.

Introduction
Coronavirus is commonly found in nature and infects only mammals and birds1-3, among 46
species, only seven of them are human-susceptible4,5. Aside from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that
cause deadly pneumonia in humans by crossing the species barrier3,6,7, SARS-CoV-2 is now
bringing a global pandemic of respiratory disease (COVID-19) within six months after the first case
has been confirmed in Wuhan city of China8. It has been identified as a novel coronavirus that is a
member of β-coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, which is a positive single-stranded RNA
virus with a protein envelope2. Up to date, COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 results in more than
six million people infected and over 380 thousand deaths worldwide. Compared with SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and being highly infectious to humans8-10. It
is crucial to understand the origin of this coronavirus and its strategy in adapting to human hosts so
efficiently, moreover, to apply this knowledge for controlling this pandemic and developing
effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19.
By reconstructing phylogenomic relationships among various coronavirus11, it showed around
70% genome sequence similarity with SARS-CoV11, and more closely related to bat coronavirus
RaTG13 in the spike (S) gene1. Given closely related to SARS-like coronaviruses, the genome
structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other beta-coronaviruses, which composed in order with 5’replicase ORF1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3’ with numbers of open reading frames (ORFs)
function resembles those of SARS-CoV12. It is noted that RaTG13 is highly similar to SARS-CoV-2
especially between genes, while they differed in some crucial genomic structures, one of the most
notable features is that a polybasic (furin) cleavage site insertion (PRRA residue) at the junction
between two subunits (S1, S2) of S protein 1,2,12,13. Although some studies show bats could be the
reservoir host for many coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, the reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2
remains unclear 4,10,14. Given the global spread of this epidemic, it draws a lot of attention to reveal
the origins of the pandemic event. The evolutionary of SARS-CoV-2 may explain its infectiousness
and transmissibility among different animal hosts and provide evidence about whether this virus is
natural or artificial.
Spike glycoprotein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is the key to enter the target cells, which

forms homotrimers protruding from the surface to recognize host cell receptor and cause membrane
fusion 15. Spike protein contains S1 and S2 subunits and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) exists
on S1 which can bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
while S2 is responsible for membrane fusion during viral infection14,16. In SARS-CoV, RBD in
spike protein is the most diverse part of the whole genome, of which six amino acid (Y442, L472,
N479, D480, T487, and Y4911) have been found to play a key role in binding to ACE2 receptor
and further in transmissibility across species boundary16. Similar to SARS-CoV, RBD mutations
acquired during adaption to different host cells along transmission have also been observed in
SARS-CoV-2. Thus, dissection of the key mutations in spike protein RBD that affect binding to the
ACE2 receptor would be important for understanding the molecular mechanism of how SARSCoV-2 infect human cells. Recent studies show the ACE2 receptor in host cells would mediate the
entry ability of SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with spike protein, and its binding capacity to spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 determines the transmissibility of this coronavirus across species
particularly among humans 14,17.
The present study intends to 1) reveal the phylogenetic relationship of SARS-CoV-2 identified
in the different population at the genomic level, and provide genetic evidence based on the structural
protein-coding genes (S, M, N, E) for identifying the nucleotide variations of SARS-CoV-2
collected from different regions amid COVID-19 pandemic; 2) provide a prediction for revealing
the adaptive mutations on spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 based on the specific variation of S gene,
and finding the differences of stability of spike protein mutants and their affinities with the human
ACE2 receptors; 3) explore whether there are variants of ACE2 in different populations which may
affect the infectivity of COVID-19. To this end, we analyzed the variants of ACE2 in a large cohort
including 1000 Chinese local people and other human populations and identified polymorphisms
that may influent on the binding between ACE2 and spike protein of coronaviruses, furthermore,
we predicted the affinities of spike protein to binding ACE2 variants to understand whether those
changes would render individuals resistant or susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at the molecular level.
Herein our study could explain part of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 at a phylogenetic level based both
on whole genome and multiple key genes, to allow the elucidation of population risk profiles and
also help advance therapeutics such as a rationally designed soluble ACE2 receptor for the

further filtered according to their completeness. The genome sequencing of a local donor has been
completed in a laboratory from the local CDC, and the relevant data is stored in the local CDC
laboratory database for further analysis and research. In this study, all the virus sequences were
aligned with Clustal Omega (V1.2.3)18 and filtered by sequences containing continuous 15 Ns, and
327 non-repetitive sequences of S gene and 469 of S, N, M, E combined sequences of SARS-CoV-2
were extracted from the filtered genome sequences respectively. Iqtree (v1.6.12)19 was used to
determine the most suitable model for each sequence dataset. We chose the maximum likelihood
tree reconstructed using MEGA v5.220. The parameter we performed with 1000 Maximum number
of iterations and approximate Bayes test. Figtree v1.421 was performed on editing and screening the
evolutionary tree topology. The calculation of genetic distance (whole genome and individual genes)
was carried out by Kimura two factor correction method for nucleic acid level calculation. To avoid
the prediction error caused by the selection of outgroups with a far evolutionary relationship, the
complex outgroup was adopted in this study, and the sequence of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were
selected as outgroups to predict the genetic relationship.
In silico mutagenesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain bound to the
ACE2 receptor complex (PDBID: 6M0J) was used to predict the influence of binding affinity and
protein stability. The proposed residue sites were substituted to 19 other amino acids and an
ensemble of the conformations (the number of conformations was limit to 25) was generated for
each mutant by low-mode MD (Molecular Dynamics). MM/GBVI was applied to calculate the
binding affinity of each conformation and ACE2 molecules. The force field used for calculation was
OPLS-AA, and the implicit solvent was the reaction field (R-Field) model. All calculations were
performed in MOE (Molecular Operating Environment)package22. The structure of ACE2 receptor
(PDBID: 6M17) was used to perform in silico mutagenesis. The genomic variants in the human

ACE2 gene for different populations were downloaded from the gnomAD database
(https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) The proposed residue sites were substituted to the amino acids
that have the reported point mutations according to gnomAD. The parameters to run the prediction
of polymorphisms in hACE2 binding to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 performed as same as the
previous one about the prediction on variants of spike protein binding to hACE2.

Results
Phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2
The Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenic trees were constructed based on 2,147 genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were selected as the out-groups
(Figure 1). After alignment, we merged identical sequences into one clade with labels kept as one.
The genomic tree showed all SARS-CoV-2 was closely related to the SARS-like virus found in the
horseshoe bat from Yunnan (RaTG13), and a coronavirus from pangolin collected in Guangdong
province was the sister taxon with RaTG13 which is closer to the virus from bat than to other
pangolins from Guangxi. SARS-CoV-2 is not related closely with SARS-CoV at the nucleic level
even they have over 72% sequence similarity. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 strains from different
regions were hard to solved completely based on genome sequences with multiple polytomies
presented on the genome tree, particularly in the later time of this pandemic. On the contrary, the
strains that closer to the original direction and towards the root position on the tree have higher
bootstrap values on the branch and solved better, which may indicate that there is a consensus
evolution as SARS-CoV-2 adapting to human hosts environment in the spread of COVID-19. The
full phylogeny trees were found in supplementary Figures 1-3.
Besides, we reconstructed the phylogenetic trees based on multiple genes (S, N, E, M) (Figure
2), since structural protein-coding genes are fundamental to host cells recognition and infection. The
phylogenetic relationship of multiple genes of different SARS-CoV-2 strains represented differently
with the phylogeny based on the genome sequences, which might show the more adaptive pattern
of the functional proteins rather than the evolutionary position of different strains from different
host populations. Unlike the genomic phylogeny pattern, structural protein-coding genes showed
more divergent on two polar areas than the strains in the middle part of the tree, we found a strain

isolated from a local patient (HN-07) shared a high similar (> 98%) sequence with the ones from
Australia, European countries and USA, and the case document showed this patient was confirmed
after his seven-day trip to Italy and he didn’t show any symptoms before his journey. Some branches
were poorly supported by the bootstrap values and exhibited polytomies, which indicated SARSCoV-2 was adapting the human hosts globally and it is hard to determine the origin of SARS-CoV-2
solely based on nucleic data. Furthermore, same to the genomic tree, multiple genes sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 are divergent from outgroups and we detected some mutations according to S gene
sequences comparison (Figure 3).
As shown in Figure 3, we extracted and aligned the S gene sequences from SARS coronavirus
in different hosts, the one from pangolin that closer to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was from a
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus spp) and we found no big fragment shift in S genes of pangolin and it
was less similar to S in SARS-CoV-2 compared with RaTG13, but the insertions exhibited in
pangolin indicated potential recombination in spike protein of coronavirus would occur during its
cross-species hosts manumission.
According to S gene sequences in different strains, we found the similarity between SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV-bat (98%) is higher than it compared with coronavirus from pangolins
(85%). It showed more solved of the phylogenetic tree based on S gene (Fig. 4) compared to the
trees based on genomic sequences and multiple genes. Nevertheless, the phylogeny reconstructed
based on genome, S gene, and multiple genes, all indicate the SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to
RaTG13 and the virus isolated from pangolin.

Polymorphism prediction of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2
S gene has been studied as the key gene for SARS-CoV-2 binding to host cells’ receptor, and
this gene shows less conserved compared to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, and some
studies suggest that the high divergence found in spike protein RBD and specifically the direct
bonding sites to ACE2 receptor play an important role to SARS-CoV-2 adapting to different animal
hosts or the populations in different regions. Combined with the phylogeny based on the S gene, we
also detected all mutationson the S gene and their binding capacity with ACE2 receptor in human
beings. 23 point mutations were predicted to significantly influence the affinity and stability of the

spike protein (Fig. 5), among which 9 polymorphisms exhibited increased affinity and stability
while 14 ones showed decreased affinity and stability (Table 1). All analysis outcomes of over 3000
polymorphisms in spike protein were shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Figure 5 and Table 1 showed the missense mutation in spike protein RBD that has significant
changes (Cutoff =3) of the affinity and stability with ACE2 receptors. Interestingly, residues L455,
Q498 and N501 would have two potential mutations that leading to contrary affinities, including
increased affinity in leucine changed to methionine on AA455, glutaurine changed to tryptophan on
AA498 and asparagine changed to tyrosine on AA501, reduced affinity in leucine changed to
alanine, glutamine changed to alanine, asparagine changed to glycine. The polymorphisms on the
same residue causing two opposite effects of affinity suggested that mutations on those positions
may lead to different adaptation directions on SARS-COV-2 to fit in different hosts. Furthermore,
Phe456, Gln493, and Phe486 showed two mutations that both result in affinity reduction. The
stability of spike protein with different mutations was showed in Table 1, we found only 5 mutants
increased the stability of spike protein including G446W, G496A, Q498W, N501Y and G502Y,
which is not consistent with the affinity.
To match the mutations of spike protein that reported by SARS-CoV-2 database of China
national center for bioinformation (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov) with our predictions, a total of 1,150
polymorphisms in spike protein were collected from the database and 643 missense variants were
selected and run analysis about their affinity and stability binding to ACE2 (Supplementary Table
2). We focused on 76 missense variants in region T333-C525 of spike protein and 9 variants bring
significant changes on the affinity of it to ACE2 (Figure 6A), moreover, 13 variants cause structural
stability changes in spike protein RBD (Figure 6B).

Polymorphisms in ACE2 affect the binding ability to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
We calculated the population frequency of 388 missense variants in ACE2 collected from
GnomAD (Supplementary Table 3) and the local population (Table 2). Analysis of their stability
and affinity to spike protein of SARS-COV-2 were performed in this study, and the results showed
no significant differences in both affinity and stability.

Discussion and Conclusions
Revealing the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2 is of great value to understand its
transmission pathway cross-species and provide a guide to long-term infection prevention of
zoonotic coronavirus. Since it is a novel coronavirus, the extremely limited morphological
information of SARS-CoV-2 could be used in the phylogenic analysis, genomic data of SARS-CoV2 nowadays provide a helpful approach to identify its divergence along with the transmission among
humans 1,4. The present study collected around 2,147 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from over
50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny based on the genome, S gene, and S-N-E-M gene
sequences, it is consistent about the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the outgroup (SARSCoV and MERS-Cov) which they are more closely related to SARS-CoV compared with MERSCoV. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is about ~80% similar to SARS-CoV11 and ~66% similar to
MERS-CoV with low query coverage as 34%, but due to the structural and biological differences
among them, they are strikingly different species of coronaviruses9,23. Some studies show the
stability and viability of SARS-CoV-2 are higher than SARS-CoV generally in both aerosol
environments and objects surfaces24, which indicates SARS-CoV-2 might adapt to human
transmission better while MERS and SARS-CoV failed to do so6,9,23,25. Same with other
studies1,2,11,26, we found all SARS-CoV-2 in our analysis were sister taxon with a coronavirus from
horseshoe bat (RaTG13) which highly suspected as the natural reservoir host of coronavirus

17,26

and the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-bat is high as 96.12%. Meanwhile, the
coronavirus isolated from pangolins also were detected 91.02% identical with SARS-CoV-2 at the
nucleotide level, which makes people think pangolins might be a potential intermediate host
between the natural reservoir and human beings. However, according to the alignment of S gene
sequence from different hosts, there are multiple insertions and deletions found in SARS-pangolin
compared with S genes from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-bat, which suggests the pangolin might not
be the direct or only intermediate host and also explained by the low branch supports on
phylogenetic trees. Unique furin (polybasic) cleavage site insertion (PRRA) were found at the inbetween region of S1 and S2 subunits of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and this structure has
potentials to enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, furthermore, this insertion has not been
identified in SARS-pangolin and SARS-bat which also may indicate the essential intermediate host

of SARS-CoV-2 remains unidentified 14,15,27.
Spike protein is a key at the first step of the viral infection in host cells for receptor recognition
to most SARS-coronavirus5,17, and the S gene is more divergent in coronavirus at a genetic level
relative to other genes14. Along adapting to the human host cellular environment, mutations occur
in spike protein in some of which enable to enhance the binding affinity and stability of spike
protein-hACE2 complex, and the enhancement would increase the transmissibility of SARS-CoV2 among human and bring more severe disease16. For instance, the transmissibility and pathogenicity
of SARS-CoV are lower from strains isolated in 2003-2004 compared with the ones from 2002200328,29, and MERS just faded away literally by itself along infecting human beings9. We
performed affinity and stability of spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 by using
MOE2019 (Molecular Operating Environment) to human ACE2 (S19-D615), point mutations on
spike protein were simulated with amino acid scanning and 3860 mutations were set up for analysis
(Supplementary Table 1). 23 variants of spike protein RBD that causing significantly higher or
lower affinity to ACE2 and stability were focused in this study, the cutoff we set up was three for
determining significance (Table 1), among 9 of the mutations that highly enhance the binding
between spike protein and ACE2, the residue G446 (Figure 7) was also reported CDC up to date
(Figure 6, Supplementary Table 2), and this sample documented as collected in early March with
closer to the original direction of the phylogenetic tree based on genomic data (figure 1).
Combined 1,150 variants (634 missense mutations in total) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 reported by CDC, we found their affinity and stability in our analysis outcomes. Among 76
missense variants that locate in the region between T333-C525, five variants in spike protein
enhance its affinity binding to hACE2 (Table 3) and only three of them increase the stability of
spike-hACE2 complex (Table 4). Additionally, we collected the genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 that harbor those variants in spike protein and found the variants V483A occurs in 26 strains from
the USA, V367F occurs in 12 strains from Hong Kong, Australia, and other European countries,
and a variant G446V that highly enhance the affinity were identified in a strain from Australia
(Supplementary Table 2). We mapped those strains onto our genomic phylogenetic tree and found
they were dispersed distributed in the position close to the SARS-bat and SARS-pangolin. As
COVID-19 widespread globally, several studies tried to find where this novel coronavirus came

from, but few reports analyze the origin of SARS-CoV-2 according to the divergent pattern in spike
protein. In our study, the multiple variants in spike protein found in different countries and clustered
in the ancestral direction on phylogeny which might suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection start to occur
at multiple sites but not only in Wuhan city. However, due to the limited detection capability and
restricted availability of samples from infected animals, the variants available in the national
database are uncompleted, more data needs to be collected for further studies.
Furthermore, since the SARS-CoV-2 strains have variants on spike protein relative to a
reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) were found more divergence on the
phylogenetic position that closer to SARS-bat and SARS-pangolin, it might indicate a consensus
evolution occurred in S gene and enable SARS-CoV-2 to adapt to human hosts well. However, since
it is difficult to determine the exact time the zero patient who got infected by SARS-CoV-2, the date
of the sample collection and data extracted could mislead the results. We believe further clinical
information from all the countries would be needed for research and this is a global concern that
requires more cooperation and collaboration but not political games or constant blames. We shared
all the analysis of over 3000 variants on spike protein in this study to help the world tracking the
mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and also can be useful to select the potential druggable targets and
neutral inhibitors to prevent the further damages may be brought by the pandemic of COVID-19.
Aside from mutations in spike protein for adapting to new hosts, the hACE2 also represents
polymorphisms in the binding region, host-virus interaction over time makes a natural selection on
both virus and host cells

30.

Therefore, the variants in hACE2 receptor would also play a role in

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cao and his colleagues (2020)31 found the polymorphisms of hACE2 do
not bring differences in different populations in resisting to the SARS-CoV-2, but their dataset is
limited. A study published on bioRxiv shows variants K26R, S16P, T27A, K31R, H34R, E35K,
E37K, D38V, N51S, N64K, K68E, F72V, T921, Q102P, G326E, G352V, D355N, H378R, Q388L,
and D509Y are predicted to increase the susceptibility of the individuals carrying these variations
while K31R, E35K, E37K, D38V, N33I, H34R, Q388L and Y83H decrease binding capacity bind
to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In our study, we found all the variants in ACE2 from GnomAD and
local dataset addition to their population frequency in different groups of human beings, same with
Eric’s results32, no significant differences in ACE2 variant frequency were found from GnomAD

while three high allele frequency hACE2 variants (I468V, N638S and R708Q) were identified in
local population with their allele frequencies are very low in other populations (Figure 8).
Researchers found three unique variants in hACE2 in the Italian population that might be
corresponding to the high fatality including P389H, W69C, and L351V33.
We compared the unique variants found in local and Italian population by mapping them on
the hACE protein structure (Figure 8) and found the Italian ones were closer to the binding region
than local ones, but in silico simulation indicated that none of them change the affinity and stability
of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 complex (Table 2). Generally, we did not find any
variants in ACE2 that would significantly increase or decrease the affinity and stability of spike
protein binding to hACE2 which may indicate SARS-CoV-2 enable to indiscriminately infect all
humans. Due to various diet and health conditions in different individuals, the efficiency and
virulence of SARS-CoV-2 might be different, and the mortality rate is also more likely to be related
to medical and health conditions and the physical condition of patients.
Up to date, there is no effective therapeutics approved universally for both treatment and
prevention of COVID-19. It is still urgent to understand the mechanism of the evolution, adaptation
and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and develop an efficient inhibitor or vaccine to prevent SARSCoV-2 leading to COVID-19. The variants in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 and the
affinity and stability of spike-hACE2 complex would provide a database for tracking the adaptive
mutation of SARS-CoV-2 and potential recombination events across different species. A study in
review right now shows ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV may have recombination and
result in more severe disease (unpublished). The analysis shared in this study would provide useful
genetic information to track the mutations that occur in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent
the recurrence of this epidemic, moreover, protect human beings from zoonotic coronavirus
infection.
