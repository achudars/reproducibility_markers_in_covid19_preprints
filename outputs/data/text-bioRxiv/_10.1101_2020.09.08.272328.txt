Abstract

30

Thrombosis has been one of the complications of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19),

31

often associated with poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and

32

inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants

33

further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine

34

Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase

35

Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to

36

interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-

37

CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We

38

examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and

39

interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which

40

some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are

41

prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore,

42

we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better

43

understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic

44

approaches.

Author summary

46

Increased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19.

47

Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting.

48

However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests

49

that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved

50

indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS

51

virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the

52

interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of

53

these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We

54

investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further

55

investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19

56

particularly in minority groups.

57

Introduction

58

The Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with coagulopathy,

59

particularly microclots in the lungs [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], that correlates with disease severity [6] [7] [8]

60

[9]. There is extensive cross-talk between inflammation and coagulation, and inflammation is

61

presumed to have a role in the observed coagulation phenotype. However, the widespread

62

thrombotic events that are seen in severe COVID-19 patients suggest that there may be a more

63

direct link.

64

In a study conducted before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the severe acute respiratory

65

syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-host interactome was investigated. A few proteins related

66

to the coagulation cascade were experimentally identified to interact with viral proteins. Poly(A)

67

Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4) was shown to interact with the nucleocapsid (N)

68

protein. Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1 or C1 inhibitor)

69

was shown to interact with nsp14, ORF14, ORF3b, ORF7b, nsp2, nsp8 and nsp13. In addition,

105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

70

Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) was shown to interact with the

71

SARS protein ORF7a. The interactions were initially identified by a high-throughput yeast two-

72

hybrid system and confirmed with LUMIER assay [10].

73

PABPC4 localizes primarily to the cytoplasm and binds to the poly(A) tail present at the 3-prime

74

end of mRNA. However, it is also found in the surface of thrombin-activated platelets, and

75

therefore it is known as activated-platelet protein-1 (APP-1) [11] [12]. PABPC4 may also be

76

involved in the regulation of protein translation in platelets and megakaryocytes or may

77

participate in the binding or stabilization of polyadenylates in platelet dense granules [13].

78

SERPING1 is a plasma protease involved in the complement, intrinsic coagulation and

79

fibrinolytic pathways. In the coagulation cascade, SERPING1 inactivates plasma kallikrein,

80

factor XIIa and factor XIIf. The absence of sufficient levels of functional SERPING1 leads to

81

hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is mediated by sustained activation of kallikrein leading to

82

cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), producing bradykinin [14].

83

VKORC1 is an enzyme critical for coagulation due to its role in converting vitamin K epoxide into

84

active vitamin K [15], the rate-limiting step in the physiological process of vitamin K recycling.

85

Importantly, vitamin K is necessary for the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to produce

86

Gla residues. Several human proteins have domains with Gla residues, including coagulation

87

factors II, VII, IX, X, and anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z. VKORC1 is expressed in all tissues,

88

but particularly in the liver, lungs, and female reproductive system. It is generally embedded in

89

the endoplasmic reticulum [16].

90

Dietary vitamin K deficiency is associated with coagulopathy, specifically bleeding. Vitamin K

91

antagonists are anticoagulant drugs that work by inhibiting the activity of VKORC1, reducing the

92

levels of available active vitamin K and coagulation factors. Of the vitamin K antagonists,

93

warfarin is most commonly used. Some variants in VKORC1, particularly those common in

94

African and African American populations, are reported to result in warfarin resistance. Warfarin

95

response is also dependent on dietary factors and liver function [17]. For these reasons, dosing

96

warfarin is complicated, and genotyping of VKORC1 to determine the presence of known

97

polymorphisms (such as c.1173C>T) is recommended before initiating warfarin treatment.

98

The impact of viral protein interactions with VKORC1, SERPING1 and PABPC4 on patient

99

outcomes in COVID-19 infection is unknown. While comorbidities, age, and other factors will

100

impact the predisposition to thrombosis or coagulopathy, binding of viral proteins to coagulation

101

related proteins may be partially responsible for the prothrombotic phenotype that is seen in

102

COVID-19 patients.

103

Through computational modeling, we examined the binding of VKORC1, SERPING1 and

104

PABPC4 to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and generated additional evidence for the binding of ORF7a

105

to VKORC1. We analyzed COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) results to find

106

the most influential variants from these genes and characterize them to find potential means of

107

effect. Moreover, we investigated several VKORC1, SERPING1 and PABPC4 variants that may

108

be associated with coagulopathy and we identified some VKORC1 variants that may result in

109

warfarin resistance. In particular, we highlight two variants, which are enriched in certain ethnic

110

groups. Better understanding of the contribution of these genes and their variants to COVID-19

111

pathogenesis may lead to new therapeutic avenues and improved prognosis. This may be of

112

crucial importance for minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19.

113

Methods

114

Structural similarities and computational docking of proteins

115

To assess the binding of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a and human VKORC1, we used I-TASSER [18]

116

[19] [20] to generate homology models for both proteins. Using the models with the best C-

117

scores from I-TASSER, we then used Zdock [21] to find potential binding sites. From Zdock, we

118

took the five top scoring protein-protein complexes as input to Rosetta Prepack and Rosetta

119

Dock [22] [23] [24] [25] to further refine the models by using rigid body perturbations. Finally, the

120

top model was further refined through Rosetta Dock local refinement.

121

In addition, to verify the binding of PABPC4 and SERPING1 with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we

122

created homology models for each using I-TASSER and Robetta [26] [27]. However, due to the

123

lack of structural data from similar proteins, sections of the models for PABPC4 and SERPING1

124

were of low quality. For this reason, we used Blast and Clustal Omega to create multiple

125

sequence alignments (MSAs) of proteins similar to interacting SARS proteins, and computed

126

the percent of columns of the homologous SARS-CoV-2 protein matching the SARS protein, as

127

well as a loglikelihood score to measure the probability that the SARS-CoV-2 homolog would be

128

included in the MSA (Table 1). In addition, the MSAs were filtered to remove duplicate

129

sequences by performing affinity propagation clustering with the Levenshtein distance matrix

130

formed from the sequences. Only the cluster centers, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 sequences were

131

used in the MSA. This was done to account for the large number of very similar sequences,

132

generally from different strains of SARS-CoV-2.

MSA fraction matching is the fraction of positions in the SARS-CoV-2 protein matching the homologous SARS

135

protein, when both are aligned in an MSA. Higher number indicates more conserved position and the range is

136

between 0 and 1.

137

MSA likelihood is the fraction of sequences in an MSA matching SARS-CoV-2 for a given column. Assuming all

138

columns are independent,

139

∏   gives the probability of finding the SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the MSA sequences,
which ranges between 0 and 1. Taking log of this value gives ∏    ∑   , an additive loglikelihood

140

score which is nonpositive, with lower values indicating more positions in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence that differ from

141

the MSA sequences.

142

We used the ORF7a homology model to query Dali [28] for similar protein structures. The top

143

structures in sequence and structural similarity were the ORF7a proteins for SARS and SARS-

144

CoV-2 (PDBs 1YO4 and 6W37). All human proteins interacting with VKORC1 were taken from

145

BIOGRID, the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets [29] [30]. In addition, we

146

queried Dali against all other viral protein structures, as modeled in I-TASSER.

147

Relevant variants from COVID19 HGI GWAS metastudies

All variants from the genomic region containing VKORC1, SERPING1, and PABPC4 ±6000 bp

were taken from the ANA2, ANA5, and ANA7 metastudies from COVID19 Host Genetics

150

Initiative [31] and The Severe Covid-19 GWAS Group [32] (Supplementary Table S1 and Table

Change in splicing is presented when all tools find a change in splicing and all hexamer scores are greater than one

156

standard deviation from the mean, and is marked in red when the variant appears in an intron. mRNA MFE changes

157

are normalized (converted into a Z-score) for KineFold, remuRNA, and mFold, then averaged. When all three mRNA

158

MFE changes are above one standard deviation, we mark the value in underline. miRNA summaries are presented

159

when all miRNA changes agree in direction, and the total change is at least 5. miRNA changes are underlined when

160

the variant appears upstream.

161

We characterized these variants in terms of splicing, using hexamer scoring tools [33] [34],

162

ESEfinder [35] [36], ExonScan [37] [38] [39], and FAS-ESS [37]. Where ESEfinder, ExonScan,

the changes in mRNA MFE were converted into Z-scores using mean and standard deviation

169

values computed by randomly sampling WT and mutant sequences. The average of the three Z-

170

scores is reported in Table 2 as “Average change in mRNA MFE (Z-score)”.

171

We also analyzed miRNA binding changes using miRDB [45] [46]. For any variant, there may be

172

multiple affected miRNA species. miRNA binding scores are provided for both the WT and

173

mutant flanking 501 nucleotides in Supplementary Table S2, and a summary of miRNA binding

174

changes is provided in Table 2. When all miRNA binding changes were in the same direction,

175

we summarized the effect.

176

We analyzed conservation using fraction matching in a nucleotide MSA, computed as the

177

fraction of sequences in the MSA matching the wild type sequence in the appropriate column.

178

This value is included in Table 2 as “Fraction matching in MSA”.

179

Finally, we collected population prevalence data from dbSNP (Supplementary Table S2 and

180

Table 3).

Characterization of synonymous and missense variants of coagulation genes of

interest

186

We found all synonymous (Supplementary Table S3) and missense (Supplementary Table S4)

187

variants of VKORC1, SERPING1 and PABPC4 genes [47] from NCBI’s Single Nucleotide

188

Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) [48] and characterized them in terms of (i) population

189

prevalence in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [49] [50] , (ii) the percent of

190

sequences matching the WT at that position in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) [51], (iii)

192

and mFold, (v) relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and (vi) relative synonymous codon

193

194

[55]. For nonsynonymous variants, we additionally used amino acid fraction matching in an

195

MSA, likelihood of the variant amino acid in an amino acid MSA, SIFT [56] [50], and Polyphen

196

[57] [50]. The fraction matching and MSA likelihood measures use sequence homology and may

197

imply selection against the variant. SIFT uses sequence homology as well as physical

198

properties of amino acids, while Polyphen uses multiple sequence and structural features to

199

predict the effect of amino acid substitutions. MFE of mRNA may affect stability of mRNA

200

transcripts, which will affect transcript abundance and translation. Codon and codon pair usage

201

have been shown to impact translation kinetics [58] [59], and their metrics may be useful in

202

assessing the impact of synonymous mutations on protein conformation and function [52]. For

203

all variants, we provide the corresponding identifier in dbSNP (rsid) [48].

204

We applied filters based on codon usage changes, mRNA MFE changes, and position

205

conservation to identify variants that were potentially impactful on protein expression or

206

conformation, which may affect interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Then, based on

Results

212

Computational verification of SARS-CoV-2 viral protein interactions

213

To study the role of coagulation in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we explored the interactions of

214

VKORC1, SERPING1 and PABPC4 with viral proteins through computational docking. VKORC1

215

and ORF7a were confirmed to have strong binding affinity. Interactions are generally limited to

216

transmembrane helices as opposed to intervening loops where warfarin is known to bind [60].

217

The top scoring complexes are shown in Fig 1. Plots of interface energy in Rosetta energy units

218

against interface root mean square error for the RosettaDock results are given in Fig 2. The

219

plots show convergence toward the minimum energy state. However, regarding SERPING1 and

220

PABPC4, due to the lack of structural data from similar proteins, sections of the models for

221

PABPC4 and SERPING1 were of low quality. Therefore, we continued our analysis by

222

examining sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to SARS proteins. Predictably, the

223

homology was high (Table 1), suggesting that homologous SARS-CoV-2 proteins maintain

224

interactions with human proteins as observed for SARS proteins. Specifically, several SARS

225

proteins were found to interact with SERPING1, so it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact

226

with SERPING1 too. In addition, PABPC4 was found experimentally to bind to SARS-CoV-2 N

227

protein [61].

238

Variants that may impact COVID-19 severity

239

GWAS metastudies on COVID-19 outcomes recently became available [31] [32]. We focused

240

on the impact of VKORC1, SERPING1, and PABPC4 gene variants on COVID-19 severity.

241

While over 700 variants from these genes were found in the studies, only 55 variants had a p-

242

value less than 0.05; these are listed in Table 2 and Table 3. However, none of them are

243

significantly impactful when controlling for multiple hypothesis testing. Interestingly, only one of

244

these is a coding variant. We characterized the 55 variants in terms of miRNA binding, splicing,

245

mRNA minimum free energy, and sequence conservation, to understand how they may affect

246

disease outcomes. miRNA’s are involved in post-transcriptional regulation by binding to mRNA

247

transcripts, resulting in degradation of the mRNA or less efficient translation. Therefore, higher

248

binding will most likely result in lower expressing protein. Summaries of miRNA changes are

249

given in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1, and full data is given in Supplementary Table

250

S2. Interestingly, for variants which effected a change in miRNA binding potential, most caused

251

a reduction in miRNA binding potential, which may increase protein expression. The mean

252

change between variant and wild type miRNA affinity predictions is -11.72414, and the median

253

is -1.

254

Splicing is involved in the production of mature mRNA’s for many genes. Changes in splicing

255

may produce alternative mature mRNA’s, preventing accurate translation, and thus resulting in

256

a protein with altered potency or affinity to the virus. While we consider splicing dysregulation as

14

257

potentially impacting gene expression and disease outcome, it has rarely been shown

258

experimentally. In vitro testing of some of these variants did not reveal differences between the

259

splice forms and WT or substantial differences in expression. For example, Wang et al [62]

260

examined the VKORC1 polymorphisms -1639G>A (rs9923231), 1173C>T (rs9934438), and

261

c.-4931C>T (rs7196161) in various cell lines and did not detect any differences in expression

262

levels. We found several intronic variants in all three genes which resulted in large changes in

263

splicing potential (Table 2). Of these, NM_000062.2:c.52-696C>T is more common in East

264

Asian populations, NM_000062.2:c.1029+2110T>C is more common in European populations,

265

and NM_000062.2:c.685+1391C>T and NM_003819.3:c.1333+26C>G are comparatively rare

266

globally.

267

Finally, sequence conservation gives an evolutionary view of the significance of any position in

268

a sequence, but it is dependent on the conservation model and the quality of sequence and

269

structural data. Several PABPC4 variants show perfect conservation at the variant position. The

270

full data are given in Supplementary Table S1.

271

We found several upstream variants in VKORC1 that resulted in higher predicted miRNA

272

binding affinity, suggesting lower expression of the protein. Of these, NM_000062.2:c.-1675G>A

273

is relatively common in all populations (9.37% MAF). We also found several upstream variants

274

in PABPC4 that resulted in lower predicted miRNA binding affinity suggesting higher expression

275

of the protein.

276

mRNA molecules will form secondary structures based on nucleotide arrangement and affinity,

277

which impact its structural stability. We found several variants resulting in large changes in

278

mRNA stability. For example, NM_000062.2:c.685+1100C>T, NM_000062.2:c.1030-1975G>C,

279

and NM_003819.3:c.*765C>A are all strongly predicted to destabilize their respective mRNA

280

transcripts. Higher MFE may suggest higher possibility for mRNA degradation, which leads to

281

decreased availability of transcripts and lower expression. These variants may increase mRNA

282

degradation, reducing protein expression.

Prevalence of VKORC1 variants across populations

287

COVID-19 has spread to the entire world, affecting people with variable genetic and racial

288

backgrounds. Therefore, we explored ORF7a interactions with variants of VKORC1 found

289

across races. There are 160 missense VKORC1 variants in dbSNP and at least 27 which affect

290

warfarin sensitivity [84]. The most common variants are shown in Table 5. The locations of the

291

warfarin sensitive variation are shown in Fig 3. However, many warfarin resistance-causing

292

variants are not listed in dbSNP, and some do not include population frequency information. In

addition, there are several intronic, upstream and downstream variants which impact warfarin

294

dosage [85]. For example, rs9923231 (c.-1639G>A, NG_011564.1:g.3588G>A), which causes

295

common in African populations (10.09%), with intermediate frequency for other populations.

302

In the United States, COVID-19 has disproportionally affected African American populations.

303

We sought to investigate whether VKORC1 variants could be implicated in the susceptibility of

304

this population. We found that African and African American populations were much more likely

305

to have at least one synonymous variant that significantly changes codon and codon pair usage

306

in a relatively conserved position. Upon further investigation, we find that this is due to a single

307

synonymous variant, VKORC1:c.358C>T, which is very common in African and African

308

American populations (19.52%) while comparatively rare elsewhere (maximum 1.19% among

309

other populations). This variant is in a relatively conserved position enriched in common codons,

310

with negative changes in relative synonymous codon and codon pair usage (RSCU, RSCPU).

311

This variant was not predicted to change mRNA MFE, while it showed mixed results for splicing

312

effects: while hexamer splicing scoring tools and ESEfinder showed changes in splicing near

313

the variant, FAS ESS and Exonscan found no changes. Furthermore, this variant is associated

314

with warfarin resistance [86] [87] [88], and in linkage disequilibrium with another variant

315

upstream of the coding sequence (CDS), NG_011564.1:g.3350A>G, which is also common in

316

African and African American populations (36.40%) and associated with warfarin resistance.

317

In addition, we identified one nonsynonymous variant, VKORC1:c.106G>T, which is relatively

318

common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations (3.857%) and rare in other populations (max

319

0.4599% among other populations). This variant is predicted to be deleterious by both SIFT and

320

Polyphen and associated with warfarin resistance. This variant appears at the end of a

321

transmembrane helix near a loop, and likely impacts loop conformation near the warfarin

322

binding site.

323

These two variants were interesting, primarily due to their significant population skew. There are

324

many other variants with different prevalence in different populations, but all others are much

325

rarer or much more common across all populations.

326

We additionally characterized the population prevalence of the variants identified from the

327

GWAS studies, finding great variance in prevalence for some. For example,

19

328

NM_024006.4:c.283+837T>C is very common in all populations (64.3% MAF globally), but less

329

common in East Asian populations (10.17%).

330

Furthermore, some nonsynonymous variants were identified from literature to impact drug

331

response or disease status. Associated nucleotide changes are not always given for these

332

variants, so characterizing them has not been possible.

333

VKORC1 paralog and variants that are impactful on warfarin dosage

334

VKORC1L1 is a VKORC1 paralog with similar function but reduced warfarin sensitivity [89] [90].

335

We aligned VKORC1 with VKORC1L1 and analyzed the differences between them in the

336

positions of variants, for additional insight into their impact on warfarin sensitivity and possible

337

binding to ORF7a.

338

In the alignment of VKORC1 and VKORC1L2, seven out of twenty positions for the

339

nonsynonymous variants impacting warfarin dosage are not conserved. This is unsurprising

340

because the non-conserved variants are localized to the loop between transmembrane helices

341

one and two, which is near the warfarin binding site (Fig 3). Swapping this region between

342

VKORC1 and VKORC1L1 causes warfarin resistance in VKORC1 and warfarin sensitivity in

343

VKORC1L1 [89].

344

In addition, we examined similarities of ORF7a with VKORC1 interacting proteins. Two human

345

proteins are structurally similar to ORF7a and interact with VKORC1: CXADR, a Coxsackievirus

346

and Adenovirus receptor [91], and PCDH1, a Hantavirus receptor [92]. Both proteins are

347

involved in cell-cell adhesion. The structural similarity of ORF7a protein, CXADR, and PCDH1

348

additionally supports the interaction of ORF7a and VKORC1. The structurally aligned regions

349

are shown in Fig 4. Structural overlap is limited to the beta sheets, with small potential for

350

biomimicry.

351

The alignment is largely confined to the beta sheets.

353

Discussion

354

COVID-19 is characterized by a prothrombotic phenotype of unknown etiology [1] [2] [3] [4] [6].

355

Developing effective treatments will require a thorough understanding of the root causes of

356

increased coagulation that is seen in some patients. Although several possible mechanisms

357

have been proposed [93] [94] [95] to explain why COVID-19 patients develop life-threatening

358

clots, there may still be many parameters that have not been explored. We have identified three

359

proteins, VKORC1, SERPING1 and PABPC4, which are related to coagulation and have been

360

shown to interact with SARS proteins. While Pfefferle et al. (2011) focused on the viral

361

interaction with proteins involved in the immune response, we focused instead on coagulation.

362

We investigated computationally the binding of these proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

363

Additionally, we identified variants of their genes and examined their prevalence across

364

populations and their association to COVID-19. We explored mechanisms by which these

365

variants may impact COVID-19 and we concluded that each of these proteins may provide a

366

potential link between COVID-19 and coagulation. Furthermore, we identified the gaps in

367

knowledge that need to be addressed to further explore their roles.

368

VKORC1 is crucial for maintaining active vitamin K levels and hence for the function of several

369

essential coagulation factors. We generated strong computational evidence pointing to an

370

interaction between VKORC1 and ORF7a that are in agreement with previous experimental

371

data. However, the impact of this interaction is currently unknown. Given the prothrombotic

372

phenotype that is seen in severe COVID-19 patients, we hypothesize that binding of ORF7a to

373

VKORC1 has an effect on coagulation that may be altered in patients with certain VKORC1

374

polymorphisms.

375

Reduced vitamin K levels were suggested to be related to worse prognosis in COVID-19

376

patients [96]. This may be due to the role of vitamin K in the production of coagulation factors

377

and coagulation regulatory proteins, the inverse relationship of vitamin K and inflammatory

21

378

response [97] [98], or the inverse relationship of vitamin K and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels [99].

379

The inflammatory and immune response is a significant cause of symptoms in COVID-19

380

patients [100]. These factors are likely linked: inflammation causes production of IL-6, which

381

initiates coagulation activity [101], exhausting the supply of coagulation factors and active

382

vitamin K. Patients exhibiting warfarin resistance, for example patients with the 106G>T

383

missense variant, may produce more active vitamin K, increasing the available supply of

384

coagulation factors and producing more severe clotting, possibly even DIC. Alternatively, the

385

presence of variants may lead to altered conformation leading to differential binding to either

386

warfarin or ORF7a. Interestingly, synonymous variant 358C>T is characterized by a large

387

change both in RSCPU and RSCU suggesting that it may be associated with altered

388

cotranslational folding. The inflammation resulting from COVID-19 infection is of particular

389

interest, as children are experiencing increased rates of Kawasaki disease-like symptoms [102],

390

especially in areas where COVID-19 outbreaks were worse.

391

In addition, the VKROC1 - ORF7a interaction may also have an impact on tetherin function.

392

SARS ORF7a is known to inhibit tetherin [103] [104], also known as BST-2. Tetherin inhibits

393

virion dispersal [105], and several viruses, including HIV, have auxiliary proteins to counter this

394

effect. The structures of tetherin and VKORC1 are noticeably similar, sharing a coiled-coil

395

architecture: VKORC1 has four alpha helices bound together [60], while tetherin exists as a

396

homomer of four alpha helices [106] [107]. Reduced VKORC1 expression or binding to ORF7a,

397

as it may occur with some variants, may increase the availability of ORF7a to bind and inhibit

398

tetherin increasing the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, ORF7a has the highest

399

RSCU of any SARS-CoV-2 protein [108]. This may make it efficiently translated, resulting in

400

high expression levels to more effectively counter the effect of tetherin.

401

Due to the limited availability of homologous structural data, homology models of PABPC4 and

402

SERPING1 could not be constructed with high confidence. Therefore, it wasn’t possible to

403

create complexes to model and analyze the interactions between these proteins and viral

22

404

proteins. Experimental validation would be instrumental in confirming these interactions. While

405

PABPC4 has been found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 N protein experimentally [61],

406

interactions between VKORC1 and ORF7a have not been confirmed. Similarly, interactions

407

between SERPING1 and viral proteins have not yet been tested but would help inform our

408

hypothesis.

409

COVID-19 has had an unequal impact on populations across the globe [109] [110]. In the

410

United States, as elsewhere, some populations are proving to be more susceptible to the

411

disease and its complications. A large number of factors influence the presentation and

412

prognosis within populations, including age, access to health care, and presence of

413

comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, advanced age, and chronic lung disease [111]

414

[112]. Understanding the relative risks and associated complications of COVID-19 on a

415

population level provides valuable information to help clinicians plan the most beneficial course

416

of treatment. Unfortunately, detailed demographic data, including breakdown by age, race,

417

gender, and comorbidities, is incomplete; as of May 30, 2020, only 22% of reported cases have

418

information on reported comorbidities and only 45% of reported cases nationwide were

419

presented with demographic data sufficient to determine race [112]. In addition, there is

420

increasing evidence that African-American populations are at higher risk of thrombotic events

421

with COVID-19, even when adjusting for common risk factors such as BMI, diabetes,

422

hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [113] [114]. This suggests a role for additional

423

molecular factors that can contribute to a predisposition to thrombosis in the presence of

424

COVID-19.

425

While many factors can influence the presentation of disease, the impact of host genetic

426

variants on viral protein interaction is not clear. In host proteins interacting with viral proteins,

427

genetic variants may affect this interaction. Reducing the strength of this interaction or the

428

availability of host proteins may reduce the effectiveness of viral proteins and the severity of

23

429

infection. On the other hand, host genetic variants may affect protein function or availability.

430

Viral interactions may exacerbate these affects.

431

For example, SERPING1 is an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, which produces bradykinin from

432

high-molecular-weight kininogens. Genetic variants that reduce the translation efficiency of

433

SERPING1 may reduce SERPING1 activity, and viral interactions with SERPING1 may further

434

reduce activity, resulting in excessive levels of bradykinin and possibly angioedema.

435

Further complicating this situation, ACE2 inactivates des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK) [115] [116], an

436

active bradykinin metabolite, and reduced ACE2 activity is associated with enhanced signaling

437

of DABK, angioedema, and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs [117] [115].

438

ACE2 activity or availability caused by genetic variants or other conditions may be exacerbated

439

by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The combined effect of ACE2 and SERPING1 inhibition by viral

proteins may cause excessively high levels of bradykinin and fluid in the lungs [116].

441

There is strong evidence, both computational and experimental, of the binding of ORF7a and

442

VKORC1. We suggest that some VKORC1 variants may affect pulmonary intravascular

443

coagulopathy observed in COVID-19. The extensive damage and clotting in the lungs may

444

exhaust coagulation factors and active vitamin K necessary for carboxylation of coagulation

445

factors. The binding of ORF7a and VKORC1 may also limit coagulation in the lungs by

446

preventing the reduction of vitamin K epoxide to active vitamin K. This interaction may be less

447

influential in patients with warfarin resistance due to increased production of VKORC1 protein or

448

modified VKORC1 conformation, resulting in increased coagulation and worse prognosis.

449

In addition, the interaction of SERPING1 and PABPC4 with viral proteins may result in

450

dysregulated coagulation and immune response. Specifically, the combined effect of ACE2 and

451

SERPING1 interacting with viral proteins may increase levels of bradykinin, potentially causing

452

fluid leaking into the lungs. As with VKORC1, genetic variants may impact the efficacy of viral

453

inhibition by changing protein conformation or expression. Because these genetic variants
