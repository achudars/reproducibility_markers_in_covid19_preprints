Abstract

25

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious threat to

26

global public health, and imposes severe burdens on the entire human society. The

27

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause

28

severe respiratory illness and death. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs

29

that can treat COVID-19. Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being actively

30

developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the

31

highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely

32

considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an

33

effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In

34

this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples

35

collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-

36

specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients were strongly

37

correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to

38

determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B

39

cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain

40

(RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-

41

CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were

42

tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. We detected

43

epitope-specific antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-neutralising activity in the immunised

44

mice. This study for the first time provides human serological data for the design of

45

vaccines against COVID-19.

Introduction

48

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by

49

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in

50

December 2019 and has since become a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 infections

51

have so far led to over 2 million cases and more than 0.13 million deaths across more

52

than 200 countries and geographical regions around the world. The World Health

53

Organization has launched a worldwide clinical trial called SOLIDARITY to test

54

antiviral treatment options for the novel coronavirus, but as of April 15, 2020, there

55

are no specific drugs for treating COVID-191. Many research teams worldwide are

56

racing to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to combat this novel coronavirus

57

pandemic.

58

Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA

59

virus with four major structural proteins: S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and

60

N (nucleocapsid) proteins2-4. The surface S protein is the key that allows SARS-COV-

61

2 to enter into cells5, as it plays a role in binding to the cellular receptor and

62

membrane fusion5,6. The SARS-CoV-2 shares 75.96% homology with the 2003

63

SARS-CoV3, and the structure and functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

64

have already been identified7. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1

65

domain binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to facilitate the entry of

66

SARS-CoV-2 into host cells6,7.

67

As of April 8, 2020, there are at least 115 vaccine candidates in active development

68

worldwide8. The SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) glycoprotein is the immunogen that is the

69

focus of the majority of the vaccine research. In the absence of in vivo and in vitro

70

data, researchers have been using in silico data based on the IEDB database or other

71

online epitope prediction algorithms9-14. However, the in silico data is less likely to be

72

useful for vaccine development, because these bioinformatics tools were not

73

optimised for vaccine design. Furthermore, the antigenic properties of S proteins

74

remain elusive, and therefore experimental immunogenic information is urgently

75

needed.

76

Although a putative epitope that binds to antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been

77

reported15, more epitopes with high affinity need to be identified. Information on

78

these epitopes would be useful, particularly in regard to human immunological bias

79

and immunodominance (ID), which might restrict the immune response.

80

Immunodominance is the phenomenon of immunogenic variation among distinct

81

immunogens or antigenic sites on the same immunogen, which has been demonstrated

82

in both CD8+ T cells and B cells16. This phenomenon has restricted the development

83

of effective vaccines for influenza A and other highly variable viruses17-19. All the

84

methods used to overcome or manipulate these viral immunity restrictions rely on the

85

landscape of immunodominance. It is therefore crucial to map the immunogenicity

86

landscape of the potential epitopes of the S protein to accelerate the development of

87

vaccines.

88

An ideal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should induce highly potent neutralising

89

antibodies but should not induce any disease-enhancing antibodies. Previous studies

90

that used the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV to immunise animals resulted in

91

adverse effect after the animals were challenged with SARS-CoV20. Jiang et al.,

92

identified five linear immunodominant (ID) sites in the S protein that did not induce

93

neutralising antibodies. On the contrary, the RBD was found to contain the major

94

neutralising epitopes in the S protein, but did not have any ID sites21.

95

In this study, we aimed to map the landscape of ID sites within the S protein of

96

SARS-CoV-2 and compare these results with those of its counterpart in SARS-CoV.

97

Unlike SARS-CoV, we found the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 had linear ID sites in sera

98

samples collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. Subsequent

99

microneutralisation tests demonstrated that mice immunised with peptides containing

100

the ID sites within RBD produced neutralising antibodies. Taken together, the RBD of

101

SARS-CoV-2 has a different ID landscape to its counterpart in SARS-CoV.

102

Furthermore, these data can provide guidance on the design of S protein-based SARS-

103

CoV-2 vaccines that might avoid adverse reactions or disease-enhancing effects.

Materials and Methods

106

Serum specimens from COVID-19 patients

107

Serum samples were collected from 39 patients with COVID-19 (22 males and 17

108

females) between Jan 26, 2020, and March 18, 2020. Twenty-six patients who were

109

discharged from hospital provided written informed consent under UW 13-265. The

110

other 13 hospitalized patients were sampled under UW 13-372, and written informed

111

consent was waived. Average sampling time from the onset date was 28.7 days (range,

112

14–44 days). The median age of patients was 59.7 years (range, 26-80 years). All

113

patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR test, and two patients had a severe

114

illness. The diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV infection followed the clinical

115

description of COVID-1922. The initial laboratory confirmation was performed on

116

nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens at the Public Health Laboratory Centre of Hong

117

Kong. The discharge criteria were clinically stable and negative nucleic acid test

118

twice consecutively (sampling interval ≥ 24 hours). Six healthy donors were also

119

sampled under UW 19-470. This study was approved by the Institutional Review

120

Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster

121

(UW 13-372, UW 13-265, and UW 19-470).

122

Animal experiments

123

The SPF BALB/c mice were supplied by the Laboratory Animal Unit of the

124

University of Hong Kong. All animal experiments were approved by the Committee

125

on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching & Research, the University of Hong Kong

126

(CULATR 5312-20). All mice were immunised by distinct vaccines on Day 0 and

127

Day 14.

128

Synthesis of peptides

129

All peptides were manufactured by GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd in the form of a dry

130

powder. The peptides were generated using solid phase synthesis methods and the

131

quality of the products was monitored by mass spectrometry. All peptides were

132

dissolved in pH 7.4 PBS buffer or 8 M pH 7.0 urea Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer.

133

Peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) carrier proteins were also

134

purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. These peptide-conjugated proteins were

135

dissolved in a pH 7.4 PBS buffer.

137

Antibody detection using ELISA

138

Epitope-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

139

(ELISA). Briefly, all peptides at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL in 50 mM pH 9.6

140

Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer were coated on ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark)

141

and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked with TBS-5% (w/v) non-fat milk

142

for 3 h at 37°C and washed four times in 0.05% Tween in TBST. Diluted patient or

143

mice sera were added into the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were

144

washed six times in TBS-0.05% Tween and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat

145

anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 37°C. The colour was developed using Trimethyl Borane

146

(TMB) solution (Sigma) and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA

147

reader. Samples from non-immunised mice or healthy volunteers were used as the

148

controls. The cut-off lines were based on the mean value plus three times the standard

149

deviation.

150

Identification of T cell epitopes using ELISpot

151

The T cell responses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot)

152

kits (Dakewe Biotech Co., Ltd) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,

153

splenocytes harvested from sacrificed mice were washed and immediately transferred

154

to anti-IFN-γ antibody pre-coated filter plates. For stimulation, splenocytes were co-

155

incubated with distinct epitopes overnight at 37℃. All samples were assayed with

156

positive controls (Phorbol myristate acetate, PMA and Ionomycin) and cells from a

157

reference donor. All images in different wells were captured using a CTL

158

ImmunoSpot ELISpot Analyzer and processed using the ImmunoCapture software

159

(Cellular Technology Ltd., USA).

160

Microneutralisation tests

161

Serial two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera (treated at 56ºC for 30 minutes) were

162

prepared from a starting dilution of 1:10. The serum dilutions were mixed with equal

163

volumes of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 as indicated. After 1 h of incubation at 37ºC,

164

35 µL of the virus–serum mixture was added to Vero-E6 cell monolayer for SARS-

165

CoV-2 infection in 96-well microtitre plates in quadruplicate. After 1 h of adsorption,

166

an additional 150 µL of culture medium was added to each well and incubated for 3

167

days at 37ºC in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. A virus back-titration was

168

performed without immune serum to assess the input virus dose. The CPE was read at

3 days post infection. The highest serum dilution that completely protected cells from

170

CPE in half the wells was estimated using the Reed-Muench method and was taken as

the neutralising antibody titre. Positive and negative control sera were included to

172

validate the assay.

Results

174

Immune responses and antiviral effects in serum from COVID-19 patients

175

All serum samples from COVID-19 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by

176

ELISA assay using plates coated by SARS-CoV-2 lysates (Figure 1A). The profiles of

177

IgG, and IgM, and IgA against S (spike) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins showed that

178

not all patients had elevated antibody titres compared to healthy donors (Figure 1B-G).

179

Generally, high IgG titres against both S and N proteins were present in the sera,

180

samples, and relatively high IgM and IgA responses were also observed in the

181

majority of patients.

182

Our previous work revealed that the correlations between microneutralisation (MN)

183

activity and anti-NP or anti-RBD IgG titres were stronger than the correlation

184

between MN activity and IgM titre22. To further investigate the correlations between

185

MN activity and anti-NP or anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA titres, we carefully analysed

186

the sera from recovered patients. We found MN activity in the sera of 26 out of 39

187

COVID-19 patients. The MN titres were adjusted following previous criteria: MN

188

titres less than 10 were re-designated a value of 5 and MN titres greater than 320 were

189

re-designated a value of 64022. We identified a very strong correlation between anti-

190

RBD IgG titres and MN activity in recovered patients (R2 = 0.8009). The correlations

191

between anti-RBD IgM/IgA titres and MN activity were weaker than for IgG (R2 =

192

0.5130 and 0.5926, respectively) (Figure 2E, G, I). However, we found very poor

193

correlations between anti-NP IgG/IgM/IgA titres and MN activity. These correlations

194

dropped dramatically when MN activity titres were greater than 1:160 (Figure 2D, F,

195

H). These results suggest that anti-RBD antibodies play an important role in the

196

antiviral immune response.

198

The landscape of immunodominant sites on the S protein in COVID-19 patients

199

To identify the immunodominant (ID) sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we

200

mapped the epitopes in 42 peptides spanning the entire extra-membrane domain (21-

201

926) of the S protein with three gaps (106-160, 365-374, and 687-741). Each peptide

202

was between 20 and 25 residues in length with a five-residue overlap. We measured

203

ID sites in terms of the positive rate and the percentage of convalescent sera from

204

COVID-19 patients having positive reactions to the epitope. Here, we used the mean

205

response plus three times the standard deviation in healthy donors as the cut-off value

206

to define positive reactions. The epitope mapping showed nine linear ID sites on the S

207

protein located at 21-45(IDa), 221-245(IDb), 261-285(IDc), 330-349(IDd), 375-

208

394(IDe), 450-469(IDf), 480-499(IDg), 522-646(IDh), and 902-926(IDi), respectively

209

(Figure 3), with an average positive rate of ≥50% among all 39 patients. We found the

210

SARS-CoV-2 RBD contained four ID sites, IDd, IDe, IDf, and IDg, whereas the

211

SARS-CoV RBD has no ID sites. Considering the SARS-CoV-2 S protein shares

212

75.96% identity with the SARS-CoV S protein, we found five out of the nine

213

fragments, IDc (79.17%), IDd (90%), IDe (90%), IDh (79.2%), and IDi (96%) were

214

evolutionarily highly conserved in the SARS-CoV S protein. However, only three of

215

the nine ID sites, IDa (63.64%), IDh (79.05%), and IDi (96%) were highly

216

homologous (>50%) to SARS-CoV S protein ID sites. These results suggest that the

217

conserved regions contribute to the immunogenicity of the S protein, whereas the

218

majority of ID sites (6 out of 9) were less likely to be conserved. Interestingly, some

219

epitopes induced personalized immune responses in specific patients. Patient 33 had

220

an extremely strong immune response to epitope S (21-45) with a 40 times increase

221

compared to the cut-off value, whereas the responses of patients 26 to 31 were not

222

significantly different compared to those of healthy donors. A similar response was

223

also observed for S (281-305), which is less likely to be an ID site. (Figure 3A) These

224

results suggest that some unexpected ID sites of the S protein might lead to highly

225

variable immune responses in patients if immunised with certain viral proteins.

226

Immunodominant sites can generate antiviral protection in a mouse model

227

To examine if specific ID sites of the S protein can generate immune responses and

228

antiviral effects, we immunised mice with the RBD and two epitopes (S370-395 and

229

S435-479) of the S protein, which were selected based on the results of B cell epitope

230

prediction, toxicity prediction, and allergenicity prediction (Figure 4A, B). The S370-

231

395 and S435-479 epitopes were validated in our epitope mapping assay in patient

232

sera, which showed positive rates of 51.3% and 74.4%, respectively. The ELISA

233

assay showed that mice immunised with the entire RBD, S370-395, and S435-479

234

generated high levels of specific antibodies (Figure 4C, D, E). In the MN test, mice

235

immunised with S370-395, S435-479 or RBD showed viral neutralising titres of

236

1:26.7, 1:16.7, and 1:33.3, respectively (Figure 4F).

237

The landscape of T cell epitopes in the RBD fragment was profiled by ELISpot assay,

238

which revealed a distinct pattern compared to the B cell responses. In the RBD

239

fragment, three of the T cell epitopes, S405-469, S480-499, and S510-521, induced

240

strong adaptive responses after immunisation. Among the epitopes, S370-395, S450-

241

469 and S480-499 were identified as ID sites in human sera (Figure 4G). The S370-

242

395 and S435-479 epitopes are more likely to be both T cell ID sites and B cell ID

243

sites.

245

Immunodominant sites might reveal potent neutralising sites of S protein

246

To validate the potential functions of ID sites, we highlighted the ID sites in the

247

SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure model containing glycosylation sites23 (Figure 5A-

248

C). Among ID sites with positive rates ranging from 50% to 60%, five sites were

249

located on the head region of the S protein and two sites were on the stem of the S

250

protein (Figure 5B). Among ID sites with positive rates over 60%, all five epitopes

251

were located on the head of the S protein (Figure 5C). Although the S protein is a

252

glycoprotein, glycosylation modification had limited effects on immunisation. Two

253

glycosylation sites, N331 and N343, were observed in the RBD region, but these sites

254

had no influence on the immune response. In sera from patients, non-glycosylated

255

peptides were able to induce immune responses (Figure 3A, C and Figure 4G, S330-

256

349).

257

The neutralising titre results (Figure 4F) suggest the ID sites have neutralising

258

activities against SARS-CoV-2, although the ID sites in SARS-CoV were unlikely to

259

be neutralising sites20. To further validate the ID sites, we compared the binding

260

residues of the S protein to reported monoclonal antibodies with the ID sites of

261

RBD15,24,25.

262

neutralising antibodies were highly similar to the ID sites (Figure 5). For CR3022, a

263

monoclonal antibody targeting a highly conserved cryptic epitope15, 14 out of 28

264

binding residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD were located in ID sites. For F26G19, a

265

mouse antibody, 11 out of 20 sites were located at ID sites, indicating there was likely

266

a relatively high binding affinity to the RBD fragment25. However, for m396, an

267

antibody with relatively low binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, only 5 out of 22

268

binding residues were located at ID sites24. This was also the case for R80, another

269

low binding affinity antibody, which had no matching binding residues24. These

270

results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 ID sites are potent neutralising sites for high-

271

affinity antibodies.

Discussion

273

In this study, we profiled IgG/IgM/IgA levels against the S protein and N protein in

274

the sera of COVID-19 patients (Figure 1). All convalescent sera from the COVID-19

275

patients contained specific antibodies against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein,

276

but not all sera had specific antibodies for the RBD fragment of the S protein. The

277

relatively high immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 N protein during infection showed it

278

has potential as an antigen for developing COVID-19 diagnostics (Figure 1). However,

279

amounts of the different antibodies varied across patients. We found that IgM

280

contributed 5%-34% of N protein-specific antibodies, whereas anti-RBD IgM

281

contributed 10%-49% of RBD-specific antibodies. Patients with acute SARS-CoV-2

282

infection displayed highly diverse immune responses, and this diversity remained

283

until convalescence. These diverse immune responses highlight safety concerns such

284

as secondary infections that need to be considered.

285

We also analysed the correlation between S or N protein-specific antibody levels and

286

SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres. The Spike RBD-specific antibody level displayed a

287

strong linear correlation with MN titres, but not with the N-specific antibody level

288

(Figure 2). This observation suggests that RBD-specific antibodies in the sera of

289

recovered patients might provide antiviral protection mainly through neutralising

290

activity rather than non-neutralising antibodies against the N protein. This suggests

291

that manipulating the RBD-induced immune responses might be more effective for

292

developing COVID-19 vaccines.

293

This is the first reported mapping of the landscape of the ID sites in the S protein of

294

SARS-CoV-2 using sera from COVID-19 patients (Figure 3). The personalized

295

immune response pattern needs to be further investigated as unexpected and highly

296

variable immune responses in some individuals might lead to adverse events or

297

disease-enhancing responses to certain viral proteins used as vaccines. We further

298

tested if the ID sites in the RBD fragment could be used as potential vaccines in mice.

299

We

300

microneutralisation titres by several orders of magnitude. Considering the relatively

301

low neutralising antibody levels in the recovered patients in this study and in a

302

previous report26, it is reasonable to expect significant differences between specific

303

antibodies and neutralising antibodies. We found there was equivalent antiviral

304

activity from immunisation with epitopes compared to immunisation with the entire

305

RBD fragment (Figure 4). This provides evidence that epitope-based vaccines could

306

offer comparable protection compared to subunit vaccines, but with the potentially

307

better safety.

308

We also compared binding residues of previously identified SARS-CoV-2

309

neutralising antibodies with ID epitopes. The ID sites in the RBD were found to be

310

potent neutralising sites for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5). Previous research suggests that

311

it might be better to overcome the immunodominance of non-neutralising antigenic

312

epitopes for SARS-CoV20,27, influenza virus A16, dengue fever virus28, and human

313

immunodeficiency virus19, which can potentially enhance the disease. Indeed a prior

314

study on SARS-CoV implicated ID sites in antibody-dependent enhancement

315

(ADE)27,29. Recent research showed that passive immunisation with early

316

convalescent COVID-19 serum in hamsters resulted in significantly lower viral loads

317

in the respiratory tract without apparent differences in the clinical signs and

318

histopathological changes30. Even so, these results provide limited information on ID.

319

We still do not know how to effectively target immunodominance, and we still need

320

to understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon.

321

Several candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 including mRNA, inactivated virus,

322

and recombinant adenovirus vaccines have started phase I clinical trials in the US and

323

China8. However, there are no reports on the targets of these candidate vaccines, and

324

they might have disease-enhancing effects. Our findings provide evidence for using

325

specific linear antigenic epitopes of S protein instead of the entire S protein for

326

vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 with better safety.
