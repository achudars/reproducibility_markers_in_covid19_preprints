SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is mediated by the interaction between the viral Spike protein and
the

human

ACE2

receptor.

This

mechanism

evolved

from

the

ancestor

bat

coronavirus

and

is

currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike
protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these
variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by
multiple

alleles

in

the

human

population.

In

the

current

study,

the

GBPM

analysis,

originally

developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino
acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2

molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic

structures. Then, we intersected these structural results with the current mutational status, based on
more

than

295,000

sequenced

cases,

in

the

SARS-CoV-2

population.

We

identified

several

Spike

mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 20 distinct patients: S477N, N439K, N501Y,
Y453F, E484K, K417N, S477I and G476S. Among these, mutation N501Y in particular is one of the
events characterizing SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, which has recently risen in frequency in Europe.
We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to
infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.

Significance Statement
We developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between
SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike/ACE2 complexes.
We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations.
Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and
future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.

Introduction
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in late 2019 (1) as
the etiological cause of a pandemic of severe proportions dubbed Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID19). The disease has reached virtually every country in the globe (2), with more than 40,000,000

characterized by a 29,903-long single stranded RNA genome, densely packed in 11 Open Reading
Frames (ORFs); the ORF1 encodes for a polyprotein which is furtherly split in 16 proteins, for a total
of 26 proteins (3).

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein adapted from subsequent mutations from a wild bat beta-coronavirus
(13), in order to exploit the N-terminal ACE2 peptidase domain conformation. As a result, SARS-CoV2 Spike can establish a strong interaction with the human cell surface, allowing the virus to fuse its

events/year (15), the virus is in continuous evolution from the original Wuhan reference sequence
(NC_045512.2) (16), and there are currently at least 6 major variants circulating in the population (3,
17). Some of these strains are characterized by a mutation in Spike, at AA 614, whereas an Aspartic
Acid (D) is substituted by a Glycine (G) (18). In fact, the Spike D614G mutation gives the name to the
most frequent viral clade (G), which was first detected in Europe at the end of January 2020, and is
currently present in all continents, with increasing frequency over time (3). D614G does not fall
within the putative RBD (AA ~330-530), but some studies suggest it may have a clinically relevant
role: D614G is positively correlated with increased case fatality rate (19), and it shows increased
transmissibility and infectivity compared to the reference genome (20).

In vitro

studies show that

Spike mutation have an increased viral load and cytopathic effect in

cultured Vero cells (16). Despite these preliminary observations, there are still several doubts on the
molecular effects of the D614G variant (21). Other recurring Spike mutations have been observed in
the population worldwide, however at frequencies of 1% or below (3); some of these mutations fall
within the RBD and therefore may have a direct role in ACE2 interaction.

observed in COVID-19 patients (22). ACE2 gene is located on chromosome Xp22.2 and consists of 18
exons, coding for an 805 AAs long protein exposed on the cell surface of a variety of human organs,
including kidneys, heart, brain, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs (23). It is unclear if tissue-expression
patterns of ACE2 may be linked to the severity of symptoms or outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections;
however, ACE2 levels in lungs were found to be increased in patients with comorbidities associated
to severe COVID-19 clinical manifestations (24), whereas polymorphisms of ACE2 have been already
described to play a role in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (25), particularly in association
with type 2 diabetes (23), all conditions predisposing to an increased risk of dying from COVID-19
(26). Despite early studies, the presence of Spike mutations potentially altering the binding with

ACE2 is still largely under-investigated, as is the role of ACE2 variants in the human population in
determining patient-specific molecular interactions between these two proteins.

In the present study, we aim at detecting which Spike and ACE2 AAs are the most important in
determining the SARS-CoV-2 entry interaction and analyze which ones have already mutated in the
population. The task is clinically relevant, providing a functional characterization of present and
future mutations targeting the ACE2/Spike binding and detected by sequencing SARS-CoV-2 on a
patient-specific basis. Characterizing the variability of both proteins must be taken in consideration
in the process of developing anti-COVID-19 strategies, such as the Spike-based vaccine currently
deployed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna (27).

Results
We set out to analyze the key AAs involved in the Spike/ACE2 interaction, in order to highlight which
ones may alter the binding affinity and therefore etiological and clinical properties of different SARSCoV-2

variants

patients.

Following

that,

and

variations relevant for this interaction have been observed in the SARS-CoV-2 and human population,
respectively.

Structural analysis of Spike/ACE2 interaction
We obtained structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike interacting with the human ACE2 from three
recent X-ray structures, deposited on the Protein Data Bank: 6LZG (10), 6M0J (11) and 6VW1 (12).
For 6VW1, two Spike/ACE2 complexes were available, so we report results for both as 6VW1-A and
6WV1-B, separately. All models show the core domains of interaction, located in the region of AA
330-530 for Spike and in the region AA 15-615 of ACE2. Full length proteins would be 1273 AAs
(Spike only known isoform, from reference SARS-CoV-2 genome NC_045512.2) and 805 AAs (ACE2
isoform 1, UniProt id Q9BYF1-1).

Selected PDB entries are wild type and their primary sequence and the higher order structures were
identical. Residues 517-519 were missed in 6VW1-B. With the aim to investigate the conformation
variability, PDB complexes were aligned by backbone and the Root Mean Square deviation (RMSd)
was computed on all equivalent not hydrogen atoms. RMSd data have shown some conformation
flexibility that confirmed our idea to take into account all PDB structures in the next investigation (Fig
1).

The GBPM method was originally developed for identifying and scoring pharmacophore and proteinprotein interaction key features by combining GRID molecular interaction fields (MIFs) according to
the GRAB tool algorithm (28). In the present study, GBPM has been applied to all selected complex

purposes, here these data guided us in the complex stabilizing AAs identification. In fact, Spike or
ACE-2 residues, within 3 Å from GBPM points, were marked as relevant in the host-guest recognition
and were qualitatively scored by assigning them the corresponding GBPM energy. If a certain residue
was suggested by more than one GBPM point, its score was computed as summa of the related GBPM
points energy (Fig. 2).

Finally, for each selected residue, the four models averaged score was considered for estimating the
role in complex stabilization. Taking into account their average scores, Spike and ACE2 AAs were
divided

by

quartiles

to

the

interpretation

of

the

results:

quartile

(Q1)

includes

the

strongest complex stabilization contributors; quartile 2 (Q2) contains residues less important than
those reported in Q1 but most relevant of those included in quartile 3 (Q3); quartile 4 (Q4) indicates
the weakest predicted interacting AAs. Such an extension of the original approach allowed us to
highlight known relevant interaction residues of both Spike (Table 1) and ACE-2 (Table 2).

Basically, the same number of AAs

was highlighted for Spike

(26 AAs)

and ACE2 (25 AAs). The

average score was also in the same range. Spike reported a population of Q1 larger than ACE2: 12 and
7 AAs, respectively. The opposite scenario was observed in the Q2 that accounted for 7 residues for
Spike and 11 for ACE2. No remarkable difference can be addressed to the Q3 and Q4 Spike-ACE2
comparison. We reasoned that mutations and variants in Q1 residues could have a more relevant
impact in the complex stability.

We then focused on mutations located in the Spike RBD (aa 330-530) with predicted interaction
contribution, as assessed by our GBPM method. The majority of mutations here are found in only a

The graphical inspection of the PDB structures revealed that Spike Asparagine (N) 439, raked at
GBPM Q2, is mainly involved in intra-protein interaction. In fact, by means of its backbone sp2 oxygen
atom, N439 accepts one hydrogen bond from Spike Serine 443 sidechain and, by its sidechain amide

group, donates one hydrogen bond to the Spike Proline 499 backbone: all these AAs are located into a
random coil loop of Spike so the N439K could minimally modify the Spike-ACE2 recognition. On the
other hand, after the theoretical mutation of the Asparagine 439 with a Lysine, it is possible to predict
a productive electrostatic interaction between the new net positively charged residue and the ACE2
Glutamate 329. Such a long-distance interaction could improve the stabilization of the complex with
respect to the Spike wild type (Figure S1).

(S)

is

a

weak

contributor to the complex interaction. In all PDB entries we selected, Serine 477 is located into a
solvent exposed random coil loop. No interaction with ACE2 or Spike residues can be observed.
Actually, the GBPM analysis included such a residue in Q2. Conversely, its mutation to Asparagine
(S477N), in our

in silico

model, revealed the possibility to establish hydrogen bond to the ACE2 Serine

19 that can clearly result in a stabilization of the complex (Figure S2). Moreover, position 477 is also
affected by three other events with lower occurrence: S477I, S477R and S477G, with 6, 2 and 2
observations

(Table

4).

Among

all, the

S447R

could

be

the most

interesting

one.

Actually, a

net

positively charged residue, such as Arginine (R), can establish a weak electrostatic interaction to
ACE2 Glutamate 87, as suggested by a theoretical model we built. The S477I and S477G could modify
the conformation of a random coil segment, so it does not appear very relevant. Conversely, S477N
and S477G could productively contribute to the Spike ACE2 complex stabilization. Of course, deeper

hypothesis.

Unfortunately, full-scale simulations cannot be rigorously performed today because the available 3D
structural models report only fragments of the complex between Spike and ACE2.

The third most common mutation, N501Y (Fig 3), targets an AA predicted to have a strong role in the
interaction in all four models, sitting in the GBPM Q1. N501Y was detected in 4,921 patients (1.67%
of the dataset): the majority of which were located in the United Kingdom (29). From a structural
point of view, we predict that a substitution, at position 501, of an Asparagine (N) with a Tyrosine (Y)

taking

into

account the chemical environment. In fact, the wild type Asparagine 501 donates one hydrogen bond
to ACE2 Tyrosine 41: such an interaction could be possible also for N501Y mutant or, as we observed
in our theoretical model, it could be replaced by pi-pi stacking (Figure S3). The rapid increase in
frequency of mutation N501Y has been recently observed in the United Kingdom and other countries,
as it is one of the variants characterizing lineage B1.1.7 (30). The Asparagine/Tyrosine substitution in
Spike position 501 could contribute to determine an evolutionary advantage for this lineage, based on
differential affinity for the human receptor ACE2 (31, 32).

A less frequent mutation amongst those predicted to contribute to the ACE2/Spike interaction is
G476S, detected in 43 samples (0.02%), and supported by three out of four structural models (Table
1, Fig 4 B). The Glycine (G) 476 was included by GBPM analysis in Q2: its contribution to the complex
stabilization is weak. Conversely to the other mutation described here, the replacement of Glycine
476 with a Serine (S) could have more evident effects on Spike ACE2 molecular recognition. In fact, in
all PDB entries, the alpha carbon of this Glycine is very close, about 4 Å, to the sidechain amide group
of the ACE2 Glutamine 24. Between these two AAs no productive interaction can be established but
the substitution of the Spike Glycine with a Serine could allow one inter-protein hydrogen bond to

ACE2 Glutamine 24. Moreover, G476S could establish the same interaction with Spike Glutamine 478
that could stabilize the conformation of a random coil segment of the viral protein resulting in a
better pre-organization to the ACE2 recognition (Figure S4).

Another Spike residue, predicted by our analysis for playing a relevant role in ACE2 recognition, is
the Glutamine 493 (Table 1). The GISAID data revealed that such an aminoacid is rarely replaced by a
Leucine (Q493L) or by an Arginine (Q493R). These mutations could affect the recognition of ACE2 in
an opposite way. Spike Glutamine 493 is involved in hydrogen bond with ACE2 Glutamate 35. The
mutation Q493L cannot establish such a productive contribution and could only hydrophobically
interact to Spike Leucine 455. Conversely, Q493R could locate its net positively charged sidechain
into an ACE2 pocket delimited by Aspartate 30, Histidine 34 and Glutamate 35. Such a positioning
could produce a remarkable electrostatic stabilization of the complex (Figure S5).

In general, we could observe that AAs with the strongest evidence for interaction contribution in the
Spike/ACE2 interface tend not to diverge from the reference (Fig 4 B), which may indicate a solid
evolutionary constraint to maintain the interface residues unchanged. For example, one of the most

st

relevant 1

quartile AA in the ACE2/Spike interaction, Glutamine (Q) 493, is rarely mutated, with 12

cases of Q493L, 4 of Q493* (the substitution of Q493 with a stop codon), 3 of Q493K, and 1 of Q493R
and Q493H. One possible exception is the aforementioned Spike mutation N501Y, located in the

st

strongest 1

quartile GBPM-predicted AA for ACE2 binding, which was found in the considerable

number of 4921 different patients.

across

vertebrates (33) and also within the human species (34), with the most frequent missense mutation
(rs41303171, N720D) present in 1.5% of the world population (Supplementary File 2).

Our analysis shows that only 5 variants of ACE2 detected in the human population are also located in
the ACE2/Spike direct binding interface (Table 5 and Fig 5). Of these, rs73635825 (causing a S19P AA
variant) is both the most frequent in the population (0.06%) and the most relevant in the interaction
with the viral protein, with a GBPM score of -47.6175 (Q1) and support from all 4 models (Table 2).
The rs73635825 SNP frequency is higher in the population of African descent (0.2%). The second
SNP, rs143936283 (E329G, Table 5) is a very rare allele (0.0066%) in the European (non-Finnish)
Asian population. The rs766996587 (M82I) SNP is also a very rare allele (0.0066%) found in the

It must be mentioned that M82I, together with S19P, has been predicted to adversely affect ACE2
stability (36). M82I, together with E329G, has been simulated to increase binding affinity with Spike
when compared to wild type ACE2, hypothesizing greater susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for patients
carrying these variants (37). Instead, E37K (37) and G352V (38) were predicted to possess a lower

potential explanations to the existence of a possible predisposing genetic background to infection, all
these studies remain inconclusive in linking allele variants to COVID-19 susceptibility.

Structurally, the S19P variant may greatly differ from the reference sequence in the interaction with
ACE2: Serine (S) is a polar residue, able to accept and donate, by means of its side chain alcoholic
group, a hydrogen bond. Proline (P), on the other hand, cannot be involved in hydrogen bonding, and
therefore should establish a weaker interaction with Spike. In fact, ACE2 Serine 19 sidechain donates
a hydrogen bond to Spike Alanine 475 backbone (Figure S6) and potentially could establish the same
interaction with Spike Glycine (G) 476, which could also be mutated (Table 4). Both Methionine (M)
82 and Glutamate (E) 329 are in Q3 minimally contributing to Spike ACE2 recognition (Figures S7
and S8). They are located within two alpha helices so their mutation could modify the secondary
structure of ACE2 corresponding to a different affinity against Spike. Such a possibility should be
more evident in the case of E329G because Glutamate 329 sidechain is involved in hydrogen bond
with ACE-2 Glutamine 325.

(5).

We

showed

that

some

mutations

are

already

present

in

the

SARS-CoV-2

population that may weakly affect the interaction with the human receptor, specifically Spike N439K,
S477N and N501Y. These mutations are rising in the viral population (>1%) and in particular N501Y
is one of the key mutations characterizing lineage B.1.1.7 (32), which has seen a recent dramatic
increase in frequency in the United Kingdom (30). Having identified this mutation proves that our
combination of targeted mutation frequency and GBPM is a useful pipeline to monitor events in the
key region used by SARS-CoV-2 to recognize and enter human bronchial cells. The same approach can
be used to monitor, in the future, if any of these events will increase in frequency, suggesting an
adaptation to the human host leveraging a higher affinity with ACE2.

On the other hand, we studied the variants in the human ACE2 population, identifying 5 loci that can
affect the binding with SARS-CoV-2 Spike. They are all rare variants, with the most frequent, S19P,
present in 0.06% of the population, and with no known clinical significance. However, other

in silico

studies have predicted their role in decreasing ACE2 stability (S19P and M82I) (36), and in altering
the affinity with Spike (increasing it: M82I and E329G (37); decreasing it: E37K (37) and G352V
(38)). The most common ACE2 variant, rs41303171 (N720D), is not located in the binding region,
and so far its predicted effects on the etiopathology of COVID-19 are still largely conjectural and
associated

to

neurological

complications

via

mechanisms

probably

independent

from

direct

interaction with Spike (41).

It remains to be seen whether, in the future, the combination of Spike and ACE2 sequences will
produce novel and unexpected COVID-19 specificities, that will require granular efforts in developing
wider-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies, such as vaccines or antiviral drugs. So far, our analysis
has

shown

a

location

on the Spike/ACE2

complex

where

both

proteins vary

in

the viral/human

population, specifically on ACE2 S19 and Spike A475/G476. While, as described in our Results, these
mutations on Spike are not likely to strongly affect the interaction surface, future combinations of
ACE2/Spike

variants

may

have

peculiar

effects

that

will

require

constant

mutation

monitoring.

Identifying single or multiple AAs involved in this viral entry interaction will allow for personalized
diagnosis and clinical prediction based on the specific combination of SARS-CoV-2 strain and ACE2
variant. Personalized COVID-19 treatment will require targeted sequencing of the patient ACE2 and
Spike, to identify the combination causing the specific case. This technical obstacle can be further
complicated by the intra-host genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2, which has recently been reported
from RNA-Sequencing studies (42).

Beyond

for

the

between

viral

protease NSP5 (43) and human histone deacetylase HDAC2 (44), which is indirectly responsible for

Materials and Methods
Structural analysis
The PDB (46) was searched for high resolution Spike/ACE2 complexes. PDB entries 6LZG (10), 6M0J
(11) and 6VW1 (12), reporting the Spike RBD interacting to ACE2, have been retrieved and taken into
account for our GBPM analysis (28). Such a computational approach compares GRID (47) molecular
interaction

fields

(MIFs)

computed

on

a

generic

complex

(A)

and

on

its

host

(B)

and

guest

(C)

components, separately. Actually, MIFs describe the interaction between a certain probe and a certain
target. If the target is represented by a complex, depending on the selected area, the MIF energies can
be

referred

to

the

interaction

between

the

probe

and

one

of

the

complex

subunits

or,

at

the

host/guest interface, with both of them. The GBPM analysis, objectively, highlights these last. Five
steps are required: (1) the complex A is disassembled in its subunits B and C; (2) MIFs are computed
on A, B and C by using the most appropriate GRID probes. A hydrogen bond acceptor/donor and a
generic hydrophobic probe can describe the basic interaction. Because GRID MIFs are stored as a 3D
matrix of interaction energy points (IEP), the same box dimensions are adopted in all calculations; (3)
each IEP of B is compared with respect to the equivalent point of A generating a new MIFs named D.
The following algorithm, available into the GRAB tool, is applied: if IEP(A) > 0 and IEP(B) > 0 then
IEP(D) = 0; if IEP(A) > 0 and IEP(B) < 0 then IEP(D) = IEP(B); if IEP(A) < 0 and IEP(B) > 0 then IEP(D)

= -IEP(A); if IEP(A) < 0 and IEP(B) < 0 then IEP(D) = IEP(A)-IEP(B). The resulting MIF D reports as
negative energy values the productive interaction between the GRID probe and B and the interface A
and B; (4) in order to obscure the interaction between the probe and B, MIFs D and C are compared,
by using the GRAB approach, producing to a new MIF E; (5) the most relevant interaction points
(GBPM features) of the MIF E are, finally, selected taking into account an energy cutoff 15% above the
global minimum. Supplementary figures focusing

on the most

relevant mutation are available in

structures. In 6VW1, showing two Spike-ACE2 complexes, namely chains A-E and B-F, both structures
have been investigated and further reported as model A and B, respectively. All selected complexes
have been conformationally compared one each other by alignment and computing the RMSd on the
cartesian coordinates of equivalent not hydrogen atoms. DRY, N1 and O original GRID probes have
been used to highlight hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors areas. In order to identify
the most relevant residues of both Spike and ACE2, we conceptually and technically extended the

(28).

In

Genetical analysis
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from human hosts and accounting for a total of 145,201 submissions
were obtained from the GISAID database on 15 October 2020 (29). Low quality (with more than 5%
uncharacterized nucleotides) and incomplete (<29,000 nucleotides, based on a total reference length
of 29,903) sequences were removed. The resulting 135,591 genome sequences were aligned on the
