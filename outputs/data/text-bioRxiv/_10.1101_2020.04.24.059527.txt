Abstract

18

Establishing consensus around the transcriptional interface between coronavirus (CoV)

19

infection and human cellular signaling pathways can catalyze the development of novel

20

anti-CoV therapeutics. Here, we used publicly archived transcriptomic datasets to

21

compute consensus regulatory signatures, or consensomes, that rank human genes

22

based on their rates of differential expression in MERS-CoV (MERS), SARS-CoV-1

23

(SARS1) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2)-infected cells. Validating the CoV consensomes,

24

we show that high confidence transcriptional targets (HCTs) of CoV infection intersect

25

with HCTs of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. Among a

26

series of novel use cases, we gather evidence for hypotheses that SARS2 infection

27

efficiently represses E2F family target genes encoding key drivers of DNA replication

28

and the cell cycle; that progesterone receptor signaling antagonizes SARS2-induced

29

inflammatory signaling in the airway epithelium; and that SARS2 HCTs are enriched for

30

genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The CoV infection consensomes

31

and HCT intersection analyses are freely accessible through the Signaling Pathways

32

Project knowledgebase, and as Cytoscape-style networks in the Network Data

33

Exchange repository.

Introduction

37

Infection of humans by coronaviruses (CoV) represents a major current global public

38

health concern. Signaling within and between airway epithelial and immune cells in

39

response to infections by CoV and other viruses is coordinated by a complex network of

40

signaling pathway nodes. These include chemokine and cytokine-activated receptors,

41

signaling enzymes and transcription factors, and the genomic targets encoding their

42

downstream effectors1–3. Placing the transcriptional events resulting from CoV infection

43

in context with those associated with host signaling paradigms has the potential to

44

catalyze the development of novel therapeutic approaches. The CoV research

45

community has been active in generating and archiving transcriptomic datasets

46

documenting the transcriptional response of human cells to infection by the three major

47

CoV strains, namely, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, or

48

MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 (SARS-CoV-1, or

49

SARS1) and 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or SARS2)4–9. To date however the field has lacked a

50

resource that fully capitalizes on these datasets by, firstly, using them to identify human

51

genes that are most consistently transcriptionally responsive to CoV infection and

52

secondly, contextualizing these transcriptional responses by integrating them with

53

‘omics data points relevant to host cellular signaling pathways.

54

We recently described the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP)10, an integrated ‘omics

55

knowledgebase designed to assist bench researchers in leveraging publically archived

56

transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq datasets to generate research hypotheses. A unique

57

aspect of SPP is its collection of consensus regulatory signatures, or consensomes,

58

which rank genes based on the frequency of their significant differential expression

59

across transcriptomic experiments mapped to a specific signaling pathway node or

60

node family. By surveying across multiple independent datasets, we have shown that

61

consensomes recapitulate pathway node-genomic target regulatory relationships to a

62

high confidence level10. Here, as a service to the research community to catalyze the

63

development of novel CoV therapeutics, we generated consensomes for infection of

64

human cells by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 CoVs. Computing the CoV consensomes

65

against those for a broad range of cellular signaling pathway nodes, we discovered

66

robust intersections between genes with high rankings in the CoV consensomes and

67

those of nodes with known roles in the response to CoV infection. Integration of the CoV

68

consensomes with the existing universes of SPP transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data

69

points in a series of use cases illuminates previously uncharacterized interfaces

70

between CoV infection and human cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, while this

71

paper was under review and revision, numerous contemporaneous and independent

72

wet bench-based studies came to light that corroborate in silico predictions made using

73

our analysis pipeline. To reach the broadest possible audience of experimentalists, the

74

results of our analysis were made available in the SPP website, as well as in the

75

Network Data Exchange (NDEx) repository. Collectively, these networks constitute a

76

unique and freely accessible framework within which to generate mechanistic

77

hypotheses around the transcriptional interface between human signaling pathways and

78

CoV infection.

Results

82

Generation of the CoV consensomes

83

We first set out to generate a set of consensomes10 ranking human genes based on

84

statistical measures of the frequency of their significant differential expression in

85

response to infection by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 CoVs. To do this we searched the

86

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases to identify datasets

87

involving infection of human cells by these strains. Many of these datasets emerged

88

from a broad-scale systematic multi-omics Pacific Northwest National Library analysis of

89

the host cellular response to infection across a broad range of pathogens 11. Since an

90

important question in the development of CoV therapeutics is the extent to which CoVs

91

have common transcriptional impacts on human cell signaling that are distinct from

92

those of other viruses, we also searched for transcriptomic datasets involving infection

93

by human influenza A virus (IAV). From this initial collection of datasets, we next carried

94

out a three step quality control check as previously described10, yielding a total of 3.3

95

million data points in 156 experiments from 38 independent viral infection transcriptomic

96

datasets (figshare File F1, section 1). Using these curated datasets, we next used

97

consensome analysis (see Methods and previous SPP publication 10) to generate

98

consensomes for each CoV strain. figshare File F1 contains the full human SARS1

99

(Section 2), SARS2 (Section 3), MERS (Section 4) and IAV (Section 5) infection

100

transcriptomic consensomes. To assist researchers in inferring CoV infection-

101

associated signaling networks, the consensomes are annotated using the previously

102

described SPP convention10 to indicate the identity of a gene as encoding a receptor,

104

sections 2-5, columns A-C).

105

Ranking of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the CoV consensomes

106

As an initial benchmark for our CoV consensome analysis, we assembled a list of 20

107

canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose role in the anti-viral response is

108

best characterized in the context of IAV infection12. As shown in Figure 1, many ISGs

109

were assigned elevated rankings across the four viral consensomes. The mean

110

percentile of the ISGs was however appreciably higher in the IAV (98.7th percentile) and

111

SARS1 (98.5th percentile; p = 6e-1, t-test IAV vs SARS1) consensomes than in the

112

SARS2 (92nd percentile, p = 5e-2, t-test IAV v SARS2) and MERS (82nd percentile; p =

113

7e-5, t-test IAV v MERS) consensomes. This is consistent with previous reports of an

114

appreciable divergence between the IAV and SARS2 transcriptional responses with

115

respect to the interferon response8. Other genes with known critical roles in the

116

response to viral infection have high rankings in the CoV consensomes, including

117

NCOA713 (percentiles: SARS1, 98th; SARS2, 97th; MERS, 89th; IAV, 99th), STAT114

118

(percentiles: SARS1, 99th; SARS2, 98th; MERS, 89th; IAV, 99th) and TAP115 (percentiles:

119

SARS1, 99th; SARS2, 94th; MERS, 83rd; IAV, 99th). In addition to the appropriate

120

elevated rankings for these known viral response effectors, the CoV consensomes

121

assign similarly elevated rankings to transcripts that are largely or completely

122

uncharacterized in the context of viral infection. Examples of such genes include

123

PSMB9, encoding a proteasome 20S subunit (percentiles: SARS1, 98th; SARS2, 97th;

124

MERS, 98th; IAV, 98th); CSRNP1, encoding a cysteine and serine rich nuclear protein

125

(percentiles: SARS1, 99th; SARS2, 94th; MERS, 98th; IAV, 94th); and CCNL1, encoding a

126

member of the cell cycle-regulatory cyclin family (percentiles: SARS1, 99th; SARS2,

127

94th; MERS, 99th; IAV, 97th). Finally, a CRISPR/Cas9 study posted as a preprint while

128

this manuscript was under review validated 27 human genes as critical modulators of

129

the host response to SARS2 infection of human cells16. Corroborating our analysis, 16

130

of these genes have significant (q < 0.05) rankings in the SARS2 consensome,

131

including ACE2 and DYRK1A (both 97th percentile), CTSL (96th percentile), KDM6A,

132

ATRX, PIAS1 (all 94th percentile), RAD54L2 and SMAD3 (90th percentile).

133

To illuminate human signaling pathways orchestrating the transcriptional response to

134

CoV infection, we next compared transcripts with elevated rankings in the CoV

135

consensomes with those that have predicted high confidence regulatory relationships

136

with cellular signaling pathway nodes. We generated four lists of genes corresponding

137

to the MERS, SARS1, SARS2 and IAV transcriptomic consensome 95th percentiles. We

138

then retrieved genes in the 95th percentiles of available SPP human transcriptomic (n =

139

25) consensomes and ChIP-Seq (n = 864) pathway node consensomes10. For

140

convenience we will refer from hereon to genes in the 95th percentile of a viral infection,

141

node (ChIP-Seq) or node family (transcriptomic) consensome as high confidence

142

transcriptional targets (HCTs). We then used the R GeneOverlap package17 to compute

143

the extent and significance of intersections between CoV HCTs and those of the

144

pathway nodes or node families. We interpreted the extent and significance of

145

intersections between HCTs for CoVs and pathway node or node families as evidence

146

for a biological relationship between loss or gain of function of that node (or node family)

147

and the transcriptional response to infection by a specific virus.

148

Results of viral infection and signaling node HCT intersection analyses are shown in

149

Figure 2 (based on receptor and enzyme family transcriptomic consensomes), Figures 3

150

and 4 (based on ChIP-Seq consensomes for transcription factors and enzymes,

151

respectively) and figshare File F2 (based on ChIP-Seq consensomes for selected co-

152

nodes). figshare File F1, sections 6 (node family transcriptomic HCT intersection

153

analysis) and 7 (node ChIP-Seq HCT intersection analysis) contain the full underlying

154

numerical data. We surveyed q < 0.05 HCT intersections to identify (i) canonical

155

inflammatory signaling pathway nodes with characterized roles in the response to CoV

156

infection, thereby validating the consensome approach in this context; and (ii) evidence

157

for nodes whose role in the transcriptional biology of CoV infection is previously

158

uncharacterized, but consistent with their roles in the response to other viral infections.

159

In the following sections all q-values refer to those obtained using the GeneOverlap

160

analysis package in R17.

161

Receptors Reflecting their well-documented roles in the response to CoV infection18–21,

162

we observed appreciable significant intersections between CoV HCTs and those of the

163

toll-like (TLRs; q-values: SARS1, 3e-85; SARS2, 5e-49; MERS, 2e-33), interferon

164

(IFNR; q-values: SARS1, 1e-109; SARS2, 6e-53; MERS, 1e-24) and tumor necrosis

factor (TNFR; q-values: SARS1, 1e-48; SARS2, 1e-35; MERS, 5e-32) receptor families

(Fig. 2). HCT intersections between CoV infection and receptor systems with previously

uncharacterized connections to CoV infection, including epidermal growth factor

receptors (EGFR; q-values: SARS1, 4e-21; SARS2, 3e-48; MERS, 1e-35), and Notch

receptor signaling (q-values: SARS1, 6e-24; SARS2, 2e-33; MERS, 2e-29; Fig. 2), are

171

receptor HCT intersection points to a possible mechanistic basis for the potential of

172

Notch pathway modulation in the treatment of SARS227. The strong HCT intersection

173

between CoV infection and xenobiotic receptors (q-values: SARS1, 1e-30; SARS2, 1e-

174

44; MERS, 5e-32; Fig. 2) reflects work describing a role for pregnane X receptor in

175

innate immunity28 and points to a potential role for members of this family in the

176

response to CoV infection. In addition, the robust intersection between HCTs for SARS2

177

infection and vitamin D receptor (q = 2e-35) is interesting in light of epidemiological

178

studies suggesting a link between risk of SARS2 infection and vitamin D deficiency29,30.

179

Consistent with a robust signature for the glucocorticoid receptor across all CoVs (GR;

180

q-values: SARS1, 3e-35; SARS2, 1e-35; MERS, 7e-32), while this paper was under

181

review, studies were published showing the GR agonist dexamethasone was a

182

successful therapeutic for SARS2 infection31. Finally, and also while this paper was

183

under review, in vitro analyses confirmed our predictions of the modulation by SARS2

184

infection of ErbB/EGFR20,32 and TGFBR16,32 signaling systems (Fig. 2).

185

Transcription factors Not unexpectedly – and speaking again to validation of the

186

consensomes - the strongest and most significant CoV HCT intersections were

187

observed for HCTs for known transcription factor mediators of the transcriptional

188

response to CoV infection, including members of the NFκB (q-value ranges: SARS1,

189

1e-7-1e-9; SARS2, 9e-3-2e-3; MERS, 1e-3-1e-4)33–35, IRF (q-value ranges: SARS1, 2e-

194

strongest with the SARS1 (q = 2e-34) and IAV (q = 3e-49) HCTs. Corroborating our

195

finding of a strong intersection between STAT2 and SARS2 infection HCTs (q = 3e-29),

196

a study that appeared while this manuscript was under review showed that STAT2 plays

197

a prominent role in the response to SARS2 infection of Syrian hamsters40. HCT

198

intersections for nodes originally characterized as having a general role in RNA Pol II

199

transcription, including TBP (q-values: SARS1, 2e-10; SARS2, 6e-23; MERS, 3e-16),

200

GTF2B/TFIIB (q-values: SARS1, 7e-10; SARS2, 3e-23; MERS, 9e-14) and GTF2F1 (q-

201

values: SARS1, 2e-4; SARS2, 2e-13; MERS, 5e-5) were strong across all CoVs, and

202

particularly noteworthy in the case of SARS2. In the case of GTF2B, these data are

203

consistent with previous evidence identifying it as a specific target for orthomyxovirus41,

204

and the herpes simplex42 and hepatitis B43 viruses. Moreover, a proteomic analysis that

205

appeared in BioRXiv while this paper was under review identified a high confidence

206

interaction between GTF2F2 and the SARS2 NSP9 replicase32.

207

In general, intersections between viral infection and ChIP-Seq enrichments for

208

transcription factors and other nodes were more specific for individual CoV infection

209

HCTs (compare Fig. 2 with Figs. 3 & 4 and figshare File F1, sections 6 and 7). This is

210

likely due to the fact that ChIP-Seq consensomes are based on direct promoter binding

211

by a specific node antigen, whereas transcriptomic consensomes encompass both

212

direct and indirect targets of specific receptor and enzyme node families.

213

Enzymes Compared to the roles of receptors and transcription factors in the response

214

to viral infection, the roles of signaling enzymes are less well illuminated – indeed, in the

215

context of CoV infection, they are entirely unstudied. Through their regulation of cell

216

cycle transitions, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play important roles in the
10

217

orchestration of DNA replication and cell division, processes that are critical in the viral

218

life cycle. CDK6, which has been suggested to be a critical G1 phase kinase44,45, has

219

been shown to be targeted by a number of viral infections, including Kaposi's sarcoma-

220

associated herpesvirus46 and HIV-147. Consistent with this common role across distinct

221

viral infections, we observed robust intersection between the CDK family HCTs (q-

222

values: SARS1, 8e-23; SARS2, 2e-31; MERS, 1e-30; Fig. 2) and the CDK6 HCTs (q-

223

values: SARS1, 1e-7; SARS2, 8e-8; MERS, 3e-4; Fig. 4) and those of all viral HCTs. As

224

with the TLRs, IFNRs and TNFRs, which are known to signal through CDK6 48–50,

225

intersection with the CDK6 HCTs was particularly strong in the case of the SARS2

226

HCTs (Fig. 4). Again, the subsequent proteomic analysis we alluded to earlier 32

227

independently corroborated our prediction of a role for CDK6 in the response to SARS2

228

infection.

229

CCNT2 is another member of the cyclin family that, along with CDK9, is a component of

230

the viral-targeted p-TEFB complex51. Reflecting a potential general role in viral infection,

231

appreciable intersections were observed between the CCNT2 HCTs and all viral HCTs

232

(q-values: SARS1, 4e-4; SARS2, 6e-3; MERS, 7e-5; Fig. 4). Finally in the context of

233

enzymes, the DNA topoisomerases have been shown to be required for efficient

234

replication of simian virus 4052 and Ebola53 viruses. The prominent intersections

235

between DNA topoisomerase-dependent HCTs and the CoV HCTs (q-values: SARS1,

236

3e-15; SARS2, 6e-21; MERS, 1e-26; Fig. 4) suggest that it may play a similar role in

237

facilitating the replication of these CoVs.

239

We next wished to show how the CoV consensomes and HCT intersection networks,

240

supported by existing canonical literature knowledge, enable the user to generate novel

241

hypotheses around the transcriptional interface between CoV infection and human

242

cellular signaling pathways. Given the current interest in SARS2, we have focused our

243

use cases on that virus. In addition to these use cases, figshare File F2 contains a

244

number of additional use cases omitted from the main text due to space constraints.

245

Unless otherwise stated, all q-values below were obtained using the GeneOverlap

246

analysis package in R17. We stress that all use cases represent preliminary in silico

247

evidence only, and require rigorous pressure-testing at the bench for full validation.

248

Hypothesis generation use case 1: transcriptional regulation of the SARS2

249

receptor gene, ACE2

250

ACE2, encoding membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2, has gained

251

prominence as the target for cellular entry by SARS154 and SARS255. An important

252

component in the development of ACE2-centric therapeutic responses is an

253

understanding of its transcriptional responsiveness to CoV infection. Interestingly,

254

based on our CoV consensome analysis, ACE2 is more consistently transcriptionally

255

responsive to infection by SARS CoVs (SARS1: 98th percentile, consensome q value

256

(CQV)10 = 1e-25; SARS2: 97th percentile, CQV = 4e-7) than by IAV (78th percentile,

257

CQV = 3e-8) or MERS (49th percentile, CQV = 2e-16; figshare File F1, sections 2-5).

258

The data points underlying the CoV consensomes indicate evidence for tissue-specific

259

differences in the nature of the regulatory relationship between ACE2 and viral infection.

260

In response to SARS1 infection, for example, ACE2 is induced in pulmonary cells but

261

ACE2 is repressed in pulmonary cells - a finding corroborated by other studies 56,57 - but

263

inducible in gastrointestinal cells (Fig. 5). These data may relate to the selective

264

transcriptional response of ACE2 to signaling by IFNRs (92nd percentile; figshare File

265

F1, section 8) rather than TLRs (48th percentile; figshare File F1, section 9) or TNFRs

266

(13th percentile, figshare File F1, section 10). While this manuscript was under review,

267

another study appeared confirming repression of induction of ACE2 by interferon

268

stimulation and by IAV infection58. Our data reflect a complex transcriptional relationship

269

between ACE2 and viral infection that may be illuminated in part by future single cell

270

RNA-Seq analysis in the context of clinical or animal models of SARS2 infection.

271

Hypothesis generation use case 2: evidence for antagonistic cross-talk between

272

progesterone receptor and interferon receptor signaling in the airway epithelium

273

A lack of clinical data has so far prevented a definitive evaluation of the connection

274

between pregnancy and susceptibility to SARS2 infection in CoVID-19. That said,

275

SARS2 infection is associated with an increased incidence of pre-term deliveries59, and

276

pregnancy has been previously associated with the incidence of viral infectious

277

diseases, particularly respiratory infections60,61. We were therefore interested to observe

278

consistent intersections between the progesterone receptor (PGR) HCTs and CoV

279

infection HCTs (q-values: SARS1, 3e-35; SARS2, 5e-41; MERS 5e-28), with the

280

intersection being particularly evident in the case of the SARS2 HCTs (Fig. 2; figshare

281

File F1, section 6). To investigate the specific nature of the crosstalk implied by this

282

transcriptional intersection in the context of the airway epithelium, we first identified a

283

set of 12 genes that were HCTs for both SARS2 infection and PGR. Interestingly, many

284

of these genes encode members of the classic interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)

285

response pathway12. We then retrieved two SPP experiments involving treatment of

286

A549 airway epithelial cells with the PGR full antagonist RU486 (RU), alone or in

287

combination with the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX). As shown in Figure 6, there

288

was unanimous correlation in the direction of regulation of all 12 genes in response to

289

CoV infection and PGR loss of function. These data are consistent with the reported

290

pro-inflammatory effects of RU486 in a mouse model of allergic pulmonary

291

inflammation62. Interestingly, SARS2-infected pregnant women are often

292

asymptomatic63,64. Based on our data, it can be reasonably hypothesized that

293

suppression of the interferon response to SARS2 infection by elevated circulating

294

progesterone during pregnancy may contribute to the asymptomatic clinical course.

295

Indeed, crosstalk between progesterone and inflammatory signaling is well

296

characterized in the reproductive system, most notably in the establishment of uterine

297

receptivity65 as well as in ovulation66. Consistent with our hypothesis, while this paper

298

was under review, a clinical trial was launched to evaluate the potential of progesterone

299

for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized men67. Interestingly, and also while this paper

300

was under review, a paper appeared showing that progesterone inhibited SARS2

301

replication in African green monkey kidney Vero 6 cells68. These results indicate an

302

additional mechanism, distinct from its potential crosstalk with the interferon response,

303

by which progesterone signaling may impact SARS2 infection.

308

characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells69. EMT is known to contribute to pulmonary

309

fibrosis70, acute interstitial pneumonia71 and acute respiratory distress syndrome

310

(ARDs)72, all of which have been reported in connection with SARS2 infection in

311

COVID-1973–75. We were interested to note therefore that significant HCT intersections

312

for three well characterized EMT-promoting transcription factors were specific to SARS2

313

infection (q-values: SNAI2/Slug76, 2e-2; EPAS1/HIF2α77, 9e-9; LEF178, 1e-3; Fig. 3, bold

314

symbols; figshare File F1, section 7). Consistent with this, intersections between HCTs

315

for TGFBRs, SMAD2 and SMAD3, known regulators of EMT transcriptional programs79

316

– were stronger with HCTs for SARS2 (q-values: TGFBRs, 2e-31; SMAD2, 2e-7;

317

SMAD3, 5e-17) than with those of SARS1 (q-values: TGFBRs, 6e-29; SMAD2, 2e-2;

318

SMAD3, 3e-9) and MERS (q-values: TGFBRs, 1e-16; SMAD2, 3e-3; SMAD3, 2e-12) –

319

see also Figs. 2 and 3 and figshare File F1, sections 6 and 7). Moreover, a recent

320

CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified a requirement for both TGFBR signaling and SMAD3 in

321

mediating SARS2 infection16.

322

To investigate the connection between SARS2 infection and EMT implied by these HCT

323

intersections, we then computed intersections between the individual viral HCTs and a

324

list of 335 genes manually curated from the research literature as EMT markers80

325

(figshare File F1, section 11). In agreement with the HCT intersection analysis, we

326

observed significant enrichment of members of this gene set within the SARS2 HCTs (q

327

= 4e-14), but not the SARS1 or MERS (both q = 2e-1) HCTs (Fig. 7a). Consistent with

328

previous reports of a potential link between EMT and IAV infection81, we observed

329

significant intersection between the EMT signature and the IAV HCTs (q = 1e-04).

330

One possible explanation for the selective intersection between the literature EMT

331

signature and the SARS2 HCTs relative to SARS1 and MERS was the fact that the

332

SARS2 consensome was exclusively comprised of epithelial cell lines, whereas the

333

SARS1 and MERS consensomes included non-epithelial cell biosamples (figshare File

334

F1, section 1). To exclude this possibility therefore, we next calculated airway epithelial

335

cell-specific consensomes for SARS1, SARS2 and MERS and computed intersections

336

between their HCTs and the EMT signature. We found that significant intersection of the

337

EMT signature with the CoV HCTs remained specific to SARS2 (q-values: SARS1, 2e-

338

1; SARS2, 1e-8; MERS, 2e-1) in the lung epithelium-specific CoV consensomes.

339

We next retrieved the canonical EMT genes in the SARS2 HCTs and compared their

340

percentile rankings with the other CoV consensomes. Although some EMT genes, such

341

as CXCL2 and IRF9, had elevated rankings across all four viral consensomes, the

342

collective EMT gene signature had a significantly higher mean percentile value in the

343

SARS2 consensome than in each of the other viral consensomes (Fig. 7b; SARS2

344

mean percentile = 97.5; SARS1 mean percentile = 86, p = 1e-5, t-test; MERS mean

345

percentile = 63, p = 1e-9, t-test; IAV mean percentile = 76, p = 2e-7, t-test). A column

346

named “EMT” in figshare File F1, sections 2 (SARS1), 3 (SARS2), 4 (MERS) and 5

347

(IAV) identifies the ranking of the EMT genes in each of the viral consensomes.

348

Given that EMT has been linked to ARDs72, we speculated that the evidence connecting

349

EMT and SARS2 acquired through our analysis might be reflected in the relatively

350

strong intersection between ARDs markers in SARS2 HCTs compared to other viral

351

HCTs. To test this hypothesis we carried out a PubMed search to identify a set of 88

352

expression biomarkers of ARDs or its associated pathology, acute lung injury (ALI). A

353

column named “ALI/ARDs” in figshare File F1, sections 2 (SARS1), 3 (SARS2) 4

354

(MERS) and 5 (IAV) identifies the expression biomarker genes using the PubMed

355

identifiers for the original studies in which they were identified. Consistent with our

356

hypothesis, we observed appreciable intersections between this gene set and the HCTs

357

of all four viruses (SARS1 odds ratio (OR) = 7, q = 5e-9; SARS2 OR = 10.4, q = 1e-9;

358

MERS, OR = 4.2, q = 2e-5; IAV OR = 6.8; q = 9e-8) with a particularly strong

359

intersection evident in the SARS2 HCTs.

360

Although EMT has been associated with infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus82

361

and IAV81, this is to our knowledge the first evidence connecting CoV infection, and

362

specifically SARS2 infection, to an EMT signature. Interestingly, lipotoxin A4 has been

363

shown to attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury by reducing EMT83.

364

Moreover, several members of the group of SARS2-induced EMT genes have been

365

associated with signature pulmonary comorbidities of CoV infection, including ADAR84,

366

CLDN185 and SOD286. Of note in the context of these data is the fact that signaling

367

through two SARS2 cellular receptors, ACE2/AT2 and CD147/basigin, has been linked

368

to EMT in the context of organ fibrosis87–89. Finally, while this manuscript was under

369

review, a preprint was posted that described EMT-like transcriptional and metabolic

370

changes in response to SARS2 infection90. Collectively, our data indicate that EMT

371

warrants further investigation as a SARS2-specific pathological mechanism.

374

Aside from EPAS1 and SNAI2, the only other transcription factors with significant HCT

375

intersections that were specific to the SARS2 HCTs were the E2F/FOX class members

376

E2F1 (q-values: SARS1, 5e-1; SARS2, 1e-2; MERS, 4e-1), E2F3 (q-values: SARS1,

377

6e-1; SARS2, 5e-2; MERS, 7e-1), E2F4 (q-values: SARS1, 1; SARS2, 9e-3; MERS, 1)

378

and TFDP1/Dp-1 (q-values: SARS1, 1; SARS2, 3e-4; MERS, 1; Fig. 3, bold symbols;

379

figshare File F1, section 7). These factors play well-documented interdependent roles in

380

the promotion (E2F1, E2F3, TFDP1) and repression (E2F4) of cell cycle genes91,92.

381

Moreover, E2F family members are targets of signaling through EGFRs93 and CDK694,

382

both of whose HCTs had SARS2 HCT intersections that were stronger those of the

383

other CoVs (EGFRs: q-values: SARS1, 4e-21; SARS2, 3e-48; MERS, 1e-35; CDK6: q-

384

values: SARS1, 1e-7; SARS2, 8e-8; MERS, 2e-4); Figs. 2 & 4). Based on these data,

385

we speculated that SARS2 infection might impact the expression of E2F-regulated cell

386

cycle genes more efficiently than other CoVs. To investigate this we retrieved a set of

387

SARS2 HCTs that were also HCTs for at least three of E2F1, E2F3, E2F4 and TFDP1

388

(figshare File F1, section 3, columns P-T). Consistent with the role of E2F/Dp-1 nodes in

389

the regulation of the cell cycle, many of these genes – notably CDK1, PCNA, CDC6,

390

CENPF and NUSAP1 – are critical positive regulators of DNA replication and cell cycle

391

progression95–99 and are known to be transcriptionally induced by E2Fs100–103. Strikingly,

392

with the exception of E2F3, all were consistently repressed in response to SARS2

393

infection (Fig. 8a). To gain insight into the relative efficiency with which the four viruses

394

impacted expression of the E2F/Dp-1 HCT signature, we compared their mean

395

percentile values across the viral consensomes. Consistent with efficient repression of

396

the E2F/Dp-1 HCTs by SARS2 infection relative to other viruses, their mean percentile

397

ranking was appreciably higher in the SARS2 consensome (97th percentile) than in the

398

SARS1 (76th percentile; p = 6e-12, t-test), MERS (71.2 percentile; p = 9e-6, t-test) and

399

IAV (71.2 percentile; p = 2e-5, t-test) consensomes (Fig. 8b). Although manipulation of

400

the host cell cycle and evasion of detection through deregulation of cell cycle

401

checkpoints has been described for other viruses104–106, this represents the first

402

evidence for the profound impact of SARS2 infection on host cell cycle regulatory

403

genes, potentially through disruption of E2F mediated signaling pathways. The SARS2

404

infection-mediated induction of E2F3 (Fig. 8a) may represent a compensatory response

405

to transcriptional repression of other E2F family members, as has been previously

406

observed for this family in other contexts107,108. Consistent with our prediction in this use

407

case, while this paper was in revision, a study appeared showing that infection by

408

SARS2 results in cell cycle arrest109. Our results represent evidence that efficient

409

modulation by SARS2 of E2F signaling, resulting in repression of cell cycle regulatory

410

genes, may contribute to its unique pathological impact.

We have previously described the SPP biocuration pipeline, database and web

SPP website. The individual CoV consensomes can be accessed by configuring the

SPP Ominer query form as shown, in this example for the SARS2 consensome (Fig.

423

9a). Figure 9b shows the layout of the consensomes, showing gene symbol, name,

424

percentile ranking and other essential information. Genes in the 90th percentile of each

425

consensome are accessible via the user interface, with the full consensomes available

for download in a tab delimited text file. Target gene symbols in the consensome link to

influence of tissue and cell type context on the regulatory relationship. These filtered

430

reports can be readily converted to default Reports that show evidence for regulation of

431

a specific gene by other signaling pathway nodes. As previously described, pop-up

windows in the Report provide experimental details, in addition to links to the parent

433

dataset (Fig. 9d), curated accordingly to our previously described protocol10. Per FAIR

the initial rendering of the full SARS2 (Fig. 10a) and other consensome networks shows

a sample (Fig. 10a, red arrow 1) containing only the top 5% of regulated transcripts; the

444

full data can be explored using the “Neighborhood Query” feature available at the

bottom of the page (red arrow 2). The integration in NDEx of the popular Cytoscape

446

desktop application enables any network to be seamlessly be imported in Cytoscape for

447

additional analysis (red arrow 3). Zooming in on a subset of the SARS2 consensome

448

(orange box) affords an appreciation of the diversity of molecular classes that are

449

transcriptionally regulated in response to SARS2 infection (Fig. 10b). Transcript size is

450

proportional to rank percentile, and edge weight is proportional to the transcript

451

geometric mean fold change (GMFC) value. Selecting a transcript allows the associated

452

consensome data, such as rank, GMFC and family, to be examined in detail using the

453

information panel (Fig. 10b, right panel). Highlighted to exemplify this feature is IL6, an

454

inflammatory ligand that has been previously linked to SARS2 pathology8,113.

455

Consensome GMFCs are signless with respect to direction of regulation10. Researchers

456

can therefore follow the SPP link in the side panel (Fig. 10b, red arrow 4) to view the

individual underlying experimental data points on the SPP site (Fig. 9c shows the

uncharacterized (PDZKIP1, SAT1, TM4SF4) transcriptional responses to SARS2

infection. Finally, to afford insight into pathway nodes whose gain or loss of function

465

HCT intersection networks, node size is proportional to the q-value, such that the larger

466

the circle, the lower the q-value, and the higher the confidence that a particular node or

467

node family is involved in the transcriptional response to viral infection.

468

The visual organization of the NDEx interface offers insights into the impact of CoV

469

infection on human cell signaling that are not readily appreciated in the current SPP

470

interface. For example, it is readily apparent from the NDEx SARS2 consensome

471

network (Fig. 10c; Table 1) that the single largest class of SARS2 HCTs encodes

472

immunomodulatory ligands (OR = 4.6, p = 3.8 e-24, hypergeometric test), many of

473

which are members of the cytokine and chemokine superfamilies. In contrast, although

474

still overabundant (OR = 1.58, p = 6.8e-4, hypergeometric test), inflammatory ligands

475

comprise a considerably smaller proportion of the SARS1 HCTs (Table 1). These data

476

represent evidence that SARS2 infection is relatively efficient in modulating a

477

transcriptional inflammatory response in host cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, and

478

while this manuscript was under review, a study appeared showing induction of

479

interferon-stimulated genes in COVID-19 patients was more robust than in response to

480

SARS1 infection115.

Discussion

482

An effective research community response to the impact of CoV infection on human

483

health demands systematic exploration of the transcriptional interface between CoV

484

infection and human cell signaling systems. It also demands routine access to

485

computational analysis of existing datasets that is unhindered either by paywalls or by

486

lack of the informatics training required to manipulate archived datasets in their

487

unprocessed state. Moreover, the substantial logistical obstacles to high containment

488

laboratory certification emphasize the need for fullest possible access to, and re-

489

usability of, existing CoV infection datasets to focus and refine hypotheses prior to

490

carrying out in vivo CoV infection experiments. Meta-analysis of existing datasets

491

represents a powerful approach to establishing consensus transcriptional signatures –

492

consensomes – which identify those human genes whose expression is most

493

consistently and reproducibly impacted by CoV infection. Moreover, integrating these

494

consensus transcriptional signatures with existing consensomes for cellular signaling

495

pathway nodes can illuminate transcriptional convergence between CoV infection and

496

human cell signaling nodes.

497

To this end, we generated a set of CoV infection consensomes that rank human genes

498

by the reproducibility of their differential expression (p < 0.05) in response to infection of

499

human cells by CoVs. Using HCT intersection analysis, we then computed the CoV

500

consensomes against high confidence transcriptional signatures for a broad range of

501

cellular signaling pathway nodes, affording investigators with a broad range of signaling

502

interests an entrez into the study of CoV infection of human cells. Although other

503

enrichment based pathway analysis tools exist116, HCT intersection analysis differs from

504

these by computing against only genes that have the closest predicted regulatory

505

relationships with upstream pathway nodes (i.e. HCTs). The use cases described here

506

represent illustrative examples of the types of analyses that users are empowered to

507

carry out in the CoV infection knowledgebase.

508

Previous network analyses across independent viral infection transcriptomic datasets,

509

although valuable, have been limited to stand-alone studies117,118. Here, to enable

510

access to the CoV consensomes and their >3,000,000 underlying data points by the

broadest possible audience, we have integrated them into the SPP knowledgebase and

512

NDEx repository to create a unique, federated environment for generating hypotheses

513

around the impact of CoV infection on human cell signaling. NDEx provides users with

514

the familiar look and feel of Cytoscape to reduce barriers of accessibility and provides

515

for intuitive click-and-drag data mining strategies. Incorporation of the CoV data points

516

into SPP places them in the context of millions more existing SPP data points

517

documenting transcriptional regulatory relationships between human pathway nodes

518

and their genomic targets. In doing so, we provide users with evidence for signaling

519

nodes whose gain or loss of function in response to CoV infection gives rise to these

520

transcriptional patterns. The transcriptional impact of viral infection is known to be an

521

amalgam of host antiviral responses and co-option by viruses of the host signaling

522

machinery in furtherance of its life cycle. It is hoped that dissection of these two distinct

523

modalities in the context of CoV infection will be facilitated by the availability of the CoV

524

consensomes in the SPP and NDEx knowledgebases.

525

The CoV consensomes have a number of limitations. Primarily, since they are

526

predicated specifically on transcriptional regulatory technologies, they will assign low

527

rankings to transcripts that may not be transcriptionally responsive to CoV infection, but

528

whose encoded proteins nevertheless play a role in the cellular response. For example,

529

MASP2, which encodes an important node in the response to CoV infection 119, has

530

either a very low consensome ranking (SARS1, MERS and IAV), or is absent entirely

531

(SARS2), indicating that it is transcriptionally unresponsive to viral infection and likely

532

activated at the protein level in response to upstream signals. This and similar instances

533

therefore represent “false negatives” in the context of the impact of CoV infection on

534

human cells. Another limitation of the transcriptional focus of the datasets is the

535

absence of information on specific protein interactions and post-translational

536

modifications, either viral-human or human-human, that give rise to the observed

537

transcriptional responses. Although these can be inferred to some extent, the availability

538

of existing32,68,109 and future proteomic and kinomic datasets will facilitate modeling of

539

the specific signal transduction events giving rise to the downstream transcriptional

540

responses. Finally, although detailed metadata are readily available on the underlying

541

data points, the consensomes do not directly reflect the impact of variables such as

542

tissue context or duration of infection on differential gene expression. As additional

543

suitable archived datasets become available, we will be better positioned to generate

544

more specific consensomes of this nature.

545

The human CoV and IAV consensomes and their underlying datasets are intended as

546

“living” resources in SPP and NDEx that will be updated and versioned with appropriate

547

datasets as resources permit. This will be particularly important in the case of SARS2,

548

given the expanded budget that worldwide funding agencies are likely to allocate to

549

research into the impact of this virus on human health. Incorporation of future datasets

550

will allow for clarification of observations that are intriguing, but whose significance is

551

currently unclear, such as the intersection between the CoV HCTs and those of the

552

telomerase catalytic subunit (figshare File F2), as well as the enrichment of EMT genes

553

among those with elevated rankings in the SARS2 consensome (Fig. 7). Although they

554

are currently available on the SPP website, distribution of the CoV consensome data

555

points via the SPP RESTful API10 will be essential for the research community to fully

556

capitalize on this work. For example, several co-morbidities of SARS2 infection,

557

including renal and gastrointestinal disorders, are within the mission of the National

558

Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. In an ongoing collaboration with

559

the NIDDK Information Network (DKNET)120, the SPP API will make the CoV

560

consensome data points available in a hypothesis generation environment that will

561

enable users to model intersections of CoV infection-modulated host signaling with their

562

own research areas of interest. We welcome feedback and suggestions from the

563

research community for the future development of the CoV infection consensomes and

564

HCT node intersection networks.

571

Methods

572

Consistent with emerging NIH mandates on rigor and reproducibility, we have used the

573

Research Resource Identifier (RRID) standard121 to identify key research resources of

574

relevance to our study.

575

Dataset biocuration

576

Datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (SCR_005012) and Array Express

577

(SCR_002964) were biocurated as previously described, with the incorporation of an

578

additional classification of peptide ligands122 to supplement the existing mappings

579

derived from the International Union of Pharmacology Guide To Pharmacology

580

(SCR_013077).

581

Dataset processing and consensome analysis

582

Array data processing To process microarray expression data, we utilized the log2

583

summarized and normalized array feature expression intensities provided by the

584

investigator and housed in GEO. These data are available in the corresponding “Series

585

Matrix Files(s)”. The full set of summarized and normalized sample expression values

586

were extracted and processed in the statistical program R. To calculate differential gene

587

expression for investigator-defined experimental contrasts, we used the linear modeling

588

functions from the Bioconductor limma analysis package 123. Initially, a linear model was

589

fitted to a group-means parameterization design matrix defining each experimental

590

variable. Subsequently, we fitted a contrast matrix that recapitulated the sample

591

contrasts of interest, in this case viral infection vs mock infection, producing fold-change

592

and significance values for each array feature present on the array. The current

BioConductor array annotation library was used for annotation of array identifiers. P

594

values obtained from limma analysis were not corrected for multiple comparisons. RNA-

595

Seq data processing. To process RNA-Seq expression data, we utilized the aligned, un-

596

normalized, gene summarized read count data provided by the investigator and housed

597

in GEO. These data are available in the corresponding “Supplementary file” section of

598

the GEO record. The full set of raw aligned gene read count values were extracted and

599

processed in the statistical program R using the limma123 and edgeR analysis124

600

packages. Read count values were initially filtered to remove genes with low read

601

counts. Gene read count values were passed to downstream analysis if all replicate

602

samples from at least one experimental condition had cpm > 1. Sequence library

603

normalization factors were calculated to apply scale normalization to the raw aligned

604

read counts using the TMM normalization method implemented in the edgeR package

605

followed by the voom function125 to convert the gene read count values to log2-cpm.

606

The log2-cpm values were initially fit to a group-means parameterization design matrix

607

defining each experimental variable. This was subsequently fit to a contrast design

608

matrix that recapitulates the sample contrasts of interest, in this case viral infection vs

609

mock infection, producing fold-change and significance values for each aligned

610

sequenced gene. If necessary, the current BioConductor human organism annotation

611

library was used for annotation of investigator-provided gene identifiers. P values

612

obtained from limma analysis were not corrected for multiple comparisons.

613

Differential expression values were committed to the consensome analysis pipeline as

614

previously described10. Briefly, the consensome algorithm surveys each experiment

across all datasets and ranks genes according to the frequency with which they are

616

significantly differentially expressed. For each transcript, we counted the number of

617

experiments where the significance for differential expression was ≤0.05, and then

618

generated the binomial probability, referred to as the consensome p-value (CPV), of

619

observing that many or more nominally significant experiments out of the number of

620

experiments in which the transcript was assayed, given a true probability of 0.05. Genes

621

were ranked firstly by CPV, then by geometric mean fold change (GMFC). A more

622

detailed description of the transcriptomic consensome algorithm is available in a

623

previous publication10. The consensomes and underlying datasets were loaded into an

624

Oracle 13c database and made available on the SPP user interface as previously

625

described10.

626

Statistical analysis

627

High confidence transcript intersection analysis was performed using the Bioconductor

628

GeneOverlap analysis package17 (SCR_018419) implemented in R. Briefly, given a

629

whole set I of IDs and two sets A ∈ I and B ∈ I, and S = A ∩ B, GeneOverlap calculates

630

the significance of obtaining S. The problem is formulated as a hypergeometric

631

distribution or contingency table, which is solved by Fisher’s exact test. p-values were

632

adjusted for multiple testing by using the method of Benjamini & Hochberg to control the

633

false discovery rate as implemented with the p.adjust function in R, to generate q-

634

values. The universe for the intersection was set at a conservative estimate of the total

635

number of transcribed (protein and non protein-coding) genes in the human genome

636

(25,000)126. R code for analyzing the intersection between an investigator gene set and

637

CoV consensome HCTs has been deposited in the SPP Github account. A two tailed

638

640

signatures in the MERS, SARS1, SARS2 and IAV consensomes using the PRISM

641

software package (SCR_005375).

642

Consensome generation

643

The procedure for generating transcriptomic consensomes has been previously

644

described10. To generate the ChIP-Seq consensomes, we first retrieved processed

645

gene lists from ChIP-Atlas127 (SCR_015511), in which human genes are ranked based

646

upon their average MACS2 occupancy across all publically archived datasets in which a

647

given pathway node is the IP antigen. Of the three stringency levels available (10, 5 and

648

1 kb from the transcription start site), we selected the most stringent (1 kb). According to

649

SPP convention10, we then mapped the IP antigen to its pathway node category, class

650

and family, and the experimental cell line to its appropriate biosample physiological

651

system and organ. We then organized the ranked lists into percentiles to generate the

652

node ChIP-Seq consensomes. The 95th percentiles of all consensomes (HCTs, high

653

confidence transcriptional targets) was used as the input for the HCT intersection

654

analysis.

The SPP knowledgebase (SCR_018412) is a gene-centric Java Enterprise Edition 6,

657

web-based application around which other gene, mRNA, protein and BSM data from

658

external databases such as NCBI are collected. After undergoing semiautomated
