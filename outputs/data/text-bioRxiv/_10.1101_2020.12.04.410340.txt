Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the aetiology of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic. ICEP4 purified compound (ICEP4) is a recently discovered
furocoumarin-related purified compound derived from the roots and seeds of Angelica
archangelica (herbal drug). ICEP4-related herbal preparations have been extensively used as
active herbal ingredients in traditional medicine treatments in several European countries.
Extraction method of patent pending ICEP4 (patent application no. GB2017123.7) has previously
shown strong manufacturing robustness, long-lasting stability, and repeated chemical consistency.
Here we show that ICEP4 presents a significant in vitro cytoprotective effect in highly virulentSARS-CoV-2 challenged Vero E6 cellular cultures, using doses of 34.5 and 69 µM. No doserelated ICEP4 toxicity was observed in Vero E6 cells, M0 macrophages, B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T
lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) or Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. No dose-related ICEP4
inflammatory response was observed in M0 macrophages quantified by IL6 and TNFα release in
cell supernatant. No decrease in survival rate was observed after either 24 hr acute or 21-day
chronic exposure in in vivo toxicity studies performed in C. elegans. Therefore, ICEP4
toxicological profile has demonstrated marked differences compared to others vegetal
furocoumarins. Successful ICEP4 doses against SARS-CoV-2-challenged cells are within the
maximum threshold of toxicity concern (TTC) of furocoumarins as herbal preparation, stated by
European Medicines Agency (EMA). The characteristic chemical compounding of ICEP4, along
with its safe TTC, allow us to assume that the first-observation of a natural antiviral compound
has occurred. The potential druggability of a new synthetic ICEP4-related compound remains to
be elucidated. However, well-established historical use of ICEP4-related compounds as herbal
preparations may point towards an already-safe, widely extended remedy, which may be readyto-go for large-scale clinical trials under the EMA emergency regulatory pathway. To the best of
the authors´ knowledge, ICEP4-related herbal drug can be postulated as a promising therapeutic
treatment for COVID19.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped non-segmented
positive-sense

single-stranded

RNA

virus

(genus

Betacoronavirus,

subfamily

Orthocoronavirinae). SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiology of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19)
pandemic (1). Social distancing, case identification, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation are
postulated as the main strategies to reduce viral spreading. Despite worldwide research efforts
and some very promising advances, no effective antiviral drugs, or mitigant sanitary products
against SARS-CoV-2 infection currently exist, therefore, current pharmacological therapy is
mostly restricted towards mitigating the associated symptoms (2, 3).
There is continuous interest in searching for alternative antiviral drugs among phytochemical
extracts, medicinal plants, and aromatic herbs. Discovery and production of novel antiviral drugs
frequently occurs from spices, herbal medicines, essential oils (EOs), and distilled natural
products (4). Coumarins comprise a large class of compounds found within medicine herbal
preparations (5-7). Coumarins are found at high levels in some EOs, particularly cinnamon bark
oil, cassia leaf oil, and lavender oil. Coumarin is also found in fruits (e.g. bilberry, cloudberry),
green tea, and other foods, such as chicory (8). Most coumarins occur in higher plants, with the
richest sources being the Rutaceae and Umbelliferae. Although distributed throughout all parts of
the plant, the coumarins occur at the highest levels in the fruits, followed by the roots, stems, and
then leaves. Environmental conditions and seasonal changes may influence the occurrence of
coumarins in various parts of the plant (9). Psoralens are natural products that are linear
furanocoumarins (most furanocoumarins can be regarded as derivatives of psoralen or angelicin),
which are extremely toxic to a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Some
important psoralen derivatives are xanthotoxin, imperatorin, bergapten and nodekenetin (8, 9).
The demonstrated activities of coumarins include anticoagulant, anticancer, antioxidant, antiviral,
anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-neurodegerative properties as
drugs, as well as the ability to act as fluorescent sensors for biological systems (10).
The genus Angelica litoralis is comprised of over 90 species spread throughout most areas of the
globe (11). More than half of these species are used in traditional therapies, while some of them
are included in several national and European pharmacopoeias (12-15). Bioactive constituents in
different Angelica species include coumarins, EOs, polysaccharides, organic acids and acetylenic
compounds (16). In vitro testing confirmed cytotoxic (17, 18), anti-inflammatory (19),
antibacterial (20), antifungal (21), neuroprotective (22) and serotonergic (23) activities for
extracts obtained from a range of Angelica species.

Reducing viral replication at the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection and, subsequently, the
associated degree of immunopathological damage, is a critical step to mitigate and cure COVID19
(2). ICEP4 (patent pending, application nº GB2017123.7) is an Angelica archangelica-based
purified compound with previous evidence of antiviral and oncolytic in vitro effects (ICE-P Life,
data not shown). ICEP4-related herbal preparations have been extensively used as active herbal
ingredients in traditional medicine treatments in several countries, including the EU and US (1215). The main objective of this work was to evaluate the possible cytoprotective effects of the
ICEP4 extract against SARS-CoV-2 challenge by means of Crystal Violet staining, a technique
used as an indirect quantification method for cell death. In parallel, the potential cytotoxic effects
of ICEP4 were assessed, both in vitro and in vivo, using standard EMA-accepted methods. Both
objectives should support ICEP4 use as a new, safe antiviral herbal drug for COVID19 treatment
that acts via stopping viral spreading at targeted-SARS-CoV-2 epithelium, without compromising
the host immune response.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Study design
Efficacy assays were performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities at Zaragoza (Spain)
(WGUSA, laboratory reference 747735/2014). Cytotoxic studies and replication of in vitro
efficacy studies were independently repeated in biosafety level 2 (BSL2) facilities at UNATI
(IISA, Zaragoza, Spain) and BSL3 facilities at the University of Zaragoza in order to demonstrate
experimental repeatability and inter-laboratory consistency of obtained results.
ICEP4 efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge was evaluated in vitro using the Crystal Violet
staining technique. Cellular viability testing was performed by measuring the percentage of
stained cells per well after SARS-CoV-2 challenge was carried out in triplicate, in three different
tests. Three doses of ICEP4 were tested, along with the proper negative/positive controls, in three
different tests (T1, T2, and T3).
The in vitro toxicity of ICEP4 at various concentrations, was analysed in immune cells. C57BL/6
(Mus musculus) (B6)-mouse-derived bone marrow monocytes (BMC) were differentiated to M0
macrophages and incubated for 24 hrs with the various doses of ICEP4. Proper ICEP4-negative
and highest concentration-used diluent (SHAM) controls were included for comparison. After 24
hrs, cell viability was determined using the PrestoBlueTM assay. Additionally, the macrophage
inflammatory response was determined by measuring IL6 and TNFα expression in cell
supernatants. On the other hand, B6-mouse-derived splenocytes were incubated for 24 hrs with

ICEP4, along with appropiate controls as indicated for macrophages. Subsequently, cells were
labelled with CD3-FITC, CD8-APC, CD4-VioBlue and NK1.1-APCVio770 or CD19-PE, CD3FITC together with Annexin-V-PE or -APC and dead cells within the T, NK and NKT or B cells
populations were evaluated via flow cytometry (GALLIOS, Beckman Coulter).
In vivo acute and chronic toxicity was evaluated using the survival rate of ICEP4-challenged
synchronised cultured glp-4 mutant Caenorhabditis elegans. Both assays were carried out at 25ºC
in three separate experiments; the duration of the assays were 24 hrs and 21-days for acute and
chronic toxicity, respectively.
2.2. Raw Material
2.2.1. ICEP4 plant-derived extract dosing
Five mg of original 9-years-old certified-batch ICEP4 was submitted by Mr. Ezio Panzeri for
examination. ICEP4 extract comes from seeds and roots (herbal drug) of A. archangelica. Briefly,
700 g of coarsely comminated plant-derived material was successively extracted for 36 hrs with
15 L of methanol in a Soxhlet extractor (QuickfitTM large-scale extractor IIEX). The extracts were
concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator 9200/1). ICEP4 purification was
performed with high-performance liquid chromatography to reach 98% purity (UPLC Highperformance Liquid Chromatographer XEVO TQD, Waters, US), showing a characteristic
consistent chemical profile after a second ICEP4 manufactured batch (WGUSA, data not shown)
(Acquity UPLC PDA QDA <ESI-MS>, Waters, US) (Figure 1). The standard dose for toxicology
and efficacy studies of this first described natural-derived compound were determined considering
the toxicologic data from previously described Angelica-related furocoumarin (CAS number 6697-7) (24). The most appropriate solvent was taken from previous chemical characterization
studies (WGUSA, data not shown).
The starting point was a stock dilution of original ICEP4 in ethanol with a concentration of 1
mg/mL (4.6 mM). Raw material was diluted at concentrations between 1µM and 1mM to assess
preliminary ICEP4 toxicity in macrophages and immune cells. Higher concentration-used solvent
was used as SHAM control of cellular viability.
Cellular viability was assessed as an indicator of ICEP4 efficacy following SARS-CoV-2
challenge. Three doses of ICEP4 were selected based on previous immunotoxicology data. The
threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) for furocoumarins is 1.5 µg/Kg of daily exposure,
therefore, in vitro experiments were carried out taking these values into account to calculate the

maximum concentration (24). Cytotoxicity assays were performed in 96-well plates with 6.9 µM,
34.5 µM, and 69 µM concentrations of the ICEP4 maximum dose. ICEP4 doses were vehiculated,
among others, with ethanol 0.15%, 0.75% and 1.5%. The highest concentration-used solvent was
included as a SHAM control for cellular viability.
For in vivo studies, a 1 mM dose of ICEP4 was added to a 25º C-cultivated infertile strain of C.
elegans for acute and chronic studies (10.000 times higher than reference dose).
2.2.2. SARS-CoV-2 strain
A high-pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and cultured from a 72-year old patient at
University Clinical Hospital Lozano Blesa (Zaragoza, Spain). Second-passage vials with the
SARS-CoV-2 strain were provided by Dr. Julian Pardos (IISA, UNATI, Zaragoza, Spain). Virus
was maintained and cultured following UNATI protocols in BSL3 facilities at Zaragoza
(WGUSA, Spain). The tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) was determined to be 1.47 x
106/mL. The same strain and TCID50 was used at UNATI facilities for repeatability and interlaboratory consistency studies.
2.3. Methods
2.3.1. SARS-CoV-2-challenged ICEP4-treated efficacy assay
Vero E6 cells were provided by Eugenia Puentes (Biofabri, Porriño, Spain) and cultured following
provider´s descriptions. Cellular cultures were maintained at a density of 105 cell/mL in Vero E6
10% FBS (Sigma F7524) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Lonza, Ref BE12-614F)
throughout the study, at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. The efficacy assays were
performed in 96-well plates (Nunclon Delta Surface 167008 Thermo) with a density of 104
cells/well. Vero E6 cells were seeded a day prior to viral infection. The experiment was carried
out following the design described in Table 1. Briefly, the plate contained internal growing
controls of Vero E6 cells, the described concentrations of ethanol (vehicle-related toxicity
control), and ICEP4 doses (both compound toxicity control and cytoprotective effect). SARSCoV-2 was added after 1 hr of incubation (37 ºC), and the plates were then incubated for 72 hrs
at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 following viral challenge.
Cellular viability was observed by Crystal Violet staining. Briefly, 72 hrs after SARS-CoV-2
challenge, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Panreac 252931.1212) for 1 hr at room
temperature. Cells were then stained with Crystal Violet solution (0.5% crystal violet and 20%

methanol) (Sigma, C0775) (Panreac 131091.1212). Cellular viability was directly observed by
inverted microscope (DM IL LED Leica). Strong positive cellular staining (blue) was considered
as an indicator of viable cells (more than 75% of the well stained). Intermediate or weak cellular
staining was considered to represent as unviable cells (less than 75% of the well stained).
Counting was performed by two different technologists per experiment.
2.3.2. In vitro cytotoxicity assays
2.3.2.1. M0 macrophage differentiation from mouse bone marrow-derived cells
Bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) were obtained from a minimal-disease certified mouse
(C57BL/6 -M. musculus- -B6-, Charles River, US). Femurs and tibias were dissected from the
euthanised mouse and, under sterile conditions, the bone marrow was eluted by injecting DMEM
or RPMI medium through the bone cavity. Erythrocytes were lysed and final BMDC suspension
was adjusted to 106 cells/mL. BMDMs were differentiated into M0 macrophages after an
incubation period of 6 days with BMDM medium, and, finally, seeded at a concentration of 5·104
cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24 hrs, ICEP4 was dosed by making 10-fold serial dilutions and
the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hrs.
2.3.2.2. Isolation of mouse splenocytes
A minimal-disease certified mouse (B6, Charles River, US) was killed by cervical dislocation.
The spleen was then carefully extracted and mashed through a cell strainer. Splenocytes were
washed with RPMI and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. Splenocytes were counted and adjusted
to 106 cells/mL.
2.3.2.3. Macrophage cellular viability by PrestoBlueTM assay and inflammatory response
Cell viability was analysed by PrestoBlueTM HS (high sensitivity) assay following the
manufacturer´s instructions. PrestoBlueTM HS contain resazurin and a propriety buffering system
(#P50200, ThermoFisher, US). Absorbance was measured using an iMark™ Microplate
Absorbance Reader (BioRad, Germany). Activation of the inflammatory response in macrophages
was analysed quantifying the cytokines IL6 and TNFα in cell supernatants by ELISA (Ready-SetGo kit, eBiosciences) following the manufacturer´s instructions.
2.3.2.4. Lymphocytes analysis by flow cytometry

Splenocytes were incubated with the same concentrations of the ICEP4 molecule used for
macrophage studies. After 24 hrs, the cells were collected and washed, and cell viability was
analysed by annexin V staining in T, B, NK, and NKT cells, as indicated in 2.1.
2.3.3. In vivo toxicity: C. elegans assay
2.3.3.1. C. elegans strain

The C. elegans strain used was the glp-4 mutant. Caenorhabditis elegans gene glp-4 was
identified by the temperature-sensitive allele bn2 where mutants raised at the restrictive
temperature (25 °C) produce adults that are essentially germ cell deficient C. elegans.
2.3.3.2. Culturing and synchronization

C. elegans worms were propagated on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates with
kanamycin 50 µg/mL and streptomycin 100 µg/mL at 20 °C (NGM Lite, US Biological Life
Sciences, Swampscott in Massachusetts, US) using E. coli OP50 as a source of food. Due to the
presence of worms at different developmental stages in cultures, a synchronization process
consisting of killing larvae and adult worms using a combination of NaOH and NaClO was
followed, as described elsewhere (25). Eggs obtained from synchronization were resuspended and
plated on a NGM agar plate without E. coli OP50 (ISSA, Zaragoza, Spain), in order to allow the
eggs to hatch and reduce developmental differences in new larvae due to differences in egg ages.
E. coli OP50 was added to the NGM agar plate 24 hrs later.
2.3.3.3. Acute survival assay

L1 larvae obtained from synchronization were cultured at 25 °C until worms developed to L4
stage. L4 worms were harvested from plates and washed 3 times with M9. Approximately 15
worms per well were placed in a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate and treated with different
ICEP4 doses at 25 ºC. A total of 45 worms (3 wells) were assessed for each dose of ICEP4.
Worms without treatment served as negative controls. Three different independent survival assays
were carried out.
2.3.3.4. Chronic survival assay

Worms were cultured as previously described and treated with different ICEP4 doses. Worms
without treatment served as negative controls. Survival assays were carried out for 21 days at 25

°C. Every 7 days, ICEP4 and E. coli OP50 were added to the C. elegans. Chronic toxicity worms
were seeded and counted twice a week calculating the percentage of worms that survived with
respect to the number of worms at time zero. Three independent experiments were performed.
2.4. Statistics of efficacy studies
Efficacy data were analysed by Microsoft® Excel® STATS (Microsoft 365 MSO 16.0.13231.20110- 32 bits, ID 00265-80196-36405-AA936). Results were presented as
Mean ± SD (Standard Deviation). One-way ANOVA was used to confirm statistical differences
among multiple groups between treated and non-treated groups. ICEP4 – TCID50 groups were
analysed by two-sample t-test, assuming equal variances, to confirm significant differences.
Significant differences are indicated by: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; and ***P < 0.001. P < 0.05 was
considered as significant. Results from UNATI were analysed together with WGUSA obtained
data, in order to check robustness and repeatability.
3. Results
3.1. SARS-CoV-2-challenged ICEP4-treated efficacy assay
Descriptive statistics including UNATI results are shown in Table 1. Maximum SD was observed
in the TCID50 group, mostly due to outlier results in the first replication of the experiment (Figure
2). After this first trial, more coherent and consistent TCID50 results (5±1,73) were obtained
across the rest of the replications.
Marked significant differences were found between groups for at least one group as stated by
ANOVA of a factor (ICEP4 treatment) (Table 2). No differences were found by analysing the
effect of solvents or raw material vs Vero culture in a two-sample t-test assuming equal variances
(Table 3).
Marked increases in cell viability were observed when comparing to TCDI50 control were found
in SARS-CoV-2-infected ICEP4-treated groups, corresponding to 34.5 µM (WP2) and 69 µM
(WP3) doses (Table 4). Significant differences were also found between these groups when
analysing two-sample t-test results, assuming equal variances, thus confirming preliminary
descriptive results. Interpreting these results, ANOVA significance can be directly correlated to
cytoprotective effects of ICEP4 treatment.

3.2. Cytotoxicity on B and T lymphocytes, NK and NKT cells and macrophages
No toxicity on CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, or NKT was seen at the tested does of ICEP4 (Tables
5 and 6; Figure 3). However, increased Annexin-V staining, indicating slight decreases in cellular
viability, were observed in NK cells at the 100 µM dose. A similar effect was also found in
macrophages, which showed a 30% reduction in cell viability at 100 µM of ICEP4 (Figure 3).
Remarkably, ICEP4 plant-derived extract did not induce an inflammatory response in M0
macrophages at any of the tested doses, which we were able to verify via the release of IL6 and
TNFα after challenge (Table 7). IL6 and TNFα values were very low and, in some samples, very
close to or even below the limit of detection (detection limit IL6: 4 pg/mL, TNFα: 8 pg/mL). As
expected, LPS induced a high inflammatory response thereby confirming macrophage
functionality.
3.3. In vivo toxicity of ICEP4
Twenty-four hr acute and 21-day chronic in vivo toxicity studies were performed on ICEP4 in C.
elegans (Figure 4). No toxicity was observed from doses of 1 nM to 100 µM in either assay. In
both assays, only the highest dose showed toxicity (1 mM), which is presumably due to the higher
ethanol concentration (20%) and not to the active ingredient, ICEP4, as confirmed by the SHAM
control (Figure 4).
4. Discussion

Antiviral herbal drugs have been widely used on the clinical frontline against respiratory diseases.
Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), Ayurveda medicine (AM), and European herbal drugs
(EHD) are highly encouraged as adjuvant therapies in COVID19, supported by historically well
documented efficacy studies against many viral infections, including influenza, SARS, and
MERS (16, 26, 27). Vegetal drugs are frequently used in herbal decoctions for lung clearing and
detoxification in the clinical mitigant treatment of respiratory diseases and, recently, also
COVID19, with the most common being Astragalus membranaceus, Glycyrrhizae uralensis,
Saposhnikoviae divaricata, Rhizoma Atractylodis, Macrocephalae, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos,
Fructus forsythia, Atractylodis Rhizoma, Radix platycodonis, Agastache rugosa, Cyrtomium
fortune J. Sm., Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi), Asparagus
racemosus (Shatavari), Phylanthus embelica (Amalaki), and Glyceriza glabra (Yashtimadhu)
(28, 29). As reviewed by Sarker and Nahal (2004), many species of the Angelica genus, e.g., A.
acutiloba, A. archangelica, A. atropupurea, A. dahurica, A. japonica, A. glauca, A. gigas, A.

koreana, A. sinensis, A. sylvestris, etc., have been used for centuries as anti-inflammatory,
expectorant, and diaphoretic substances, as well as remedies for colds, flu, influenza, coughs,
chronic bronchitis, pleurisy, headaches, fever, and diverse bacterial and fungal infections, among
others (16). Active principles isolated from these plants mainly include various types of
coumarins, acetylenic compounds, chalcones, sesquiterpenes, and polysaccharides (9, 10, 16).
Frequently, most of the existing conventional antiviral treatments lead to the development of viral
resistance in addition to the problems of side effects, viral re-emergence, and viral dormancy (2).
Therefore, the WHO also supports and welcomes innovations around the world regarding
scientifically proven traditional medicine, in order to increase the clinical alternatives of safe
antiviral therapies (30).
Angelica archangelica-related ICEP4 has shown marked, significant in vitro cytoprotective
effects in SARS-CoV-2-challenged Vero E6 cellular cultures at doses of 34.5 and 69 µM (0.75
and 1.5 µg/dose, respectively). Successful ICEP4 doses against SARS-CoV-2 are included within
the maximum TTC of furocoumarin as a herbal preparation or remedy (24). Total daily human
exposure to coumarins from dietary or cosmetic sources is 0.06 mg/Kg/day, with a total daily dose
of 0.2% furocoumarins (1.2 µg/Kg/day) (31). No adverse effects of coumarin have been reported
in susceptible species in response to doses which are more than 100-fold the maximum human
daily intake. Successful ICEP4 doses used in these experiments are within the range of non-toxic
use of furocoumarins (1.5 µg in 100 µL per well) (13, 18, 31). It is worth mentioning that the
non-cytotoxic proof-of-concept ICEP4 dose is 4-fold lower than the antiproliferative cytotoxicity
threshold observed in previous Angelica-related studies (32-34). These promising results might
open the possibility to further studies for druggability of ICEP4. Remarkably, a highly-virulent
strain of SARS-CoV-2 was used during these experiments, therefore, we can postulate that the
ICEP4-related herbal drug is a promising potential treatment for COVID19.

EHD, AM and TCM, either alone or in combination, have been used for centuries in clinical and
prophylactic antiviral treatments, and have proven their efficacy when subjected to rigorous
scientific investigation (35). Additionally, these therapies have played a major role in the
discovery and development of many antiviral drugs based on their structural moieties, with the
classical examples being emetine and quinine (36). Naturally occurring scaffolds, such as
coumarins, display a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including anticancer,
antibiotic, and antidiabetic activities, among others, via action on multiple targets. In this view,
various coumarin-based hybrids possessing diverse medicinal attributes have been synthesised in
the past five years by conjugating a coumarin moiety with other therapeutic pharmacophores (37).
Antiviral mechanistic studies of TCM, AM, and/or EHD have revealed how they interfere with
the viral life cycle, as well as virus-specific host targets (4). Herbal drugs have demonstrated a

wide range of antiviral mechanisms that include inhibition of 3CLpro protein (Chinese Rhubarb
extracts, Houttuynia chordata extract, hesperetin, etc.), blocking or inhibition of the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase activity, and inhibition of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα,
IL1β, and IL6 (Fructus forsythiae) (38). A psychoneuroimmune mechanism has been highlighted
as a possible immune-mediated pathway in COVID19 treatment support (39, 40).

Prophylactic therapeutics with potential immunomodulatory activity have been postulated as
add-on treatments for COVID19 (29). Many medicinal compounds and natural products have
exhibited several antiviral mechanisms that prevent early stages of infection, including viral
attachment and penetration (36, 41). Psoralens, the main moiety of furocoumarins, may react
directly with pyrimidine nucleotides to form mono- and di- adducts in DNA of even interstrand
cross links (6). Another route of psoralen toxicity derives from the ability of UV-A photoactivated
furanocoumarins to react with grand state oxygen, generating toxic oxyradicals capable of
inactivating proteins within cells (6, 7). Due to this reactivity, a broad range of therapeutic
applications requiring inhibitors of cell division (main drug targets are the cytochrome P450
superfamily) have been suggested, such as vitiligo, psoriasis, and several type of cancers,
including T cell lymphoma (7, 32-34). Taking together the data from the cytotoxicity and in vivo
assays, we postulate that furocoumarin-derived ICEP4 has shown very little, or negligible
evidence of toxicity towards immune and epithelial-derived cells. NK and macrophages showed
slight decreases in viability when exposed to the highest dose, probably due to the same effect of
solvent stated for the in vivo assays. It is worth mentioning that Angelica-based furocoumarin, the
gold standard, is phototoxic and affects cellular viability within the studied doses (32, 34). Several
structural changes, well-established compound concentration and composition differences are
expected by meaning of geographic, stational or plant-related issues, many of them can be used
as drug template design (27). Therefore, it is postulated that ICEP4, despite being extracted and
purified in the same manner as other Angelica-related furocoumarins, possesses differences in
chemical or racemic compounding composition relating to the extraction method, which leads to
marked differences in terms of toxicity and antiviral efficacy (SARS-CoV-2 infection model).
These facts may let us assume that an unknown different furocoumarin-related compound has
been discovered or, at least, first observed. The extraction method of patent-pending ICEP4 has
showed previously strong manufacturing robustness, long-lasting stability, and repeated chemical
consistency. Nonetheless, additional chemical-related data regarding ICEP4 are urgently needed,
in order to highlight several concerns regarding its use as a herbal drug.

TCM, AM, and EHD-prescribed herbal drugs decrease the severity and mortality rate of
COVID19 (28, 35, 38, 41). Several drugs, such as Nigella sativa, natural honey, artemisinin,
curcumin, Boswellia, and vitamin C, are in a clinical trials for COVID19 treatment (35). Although

promising clinical evidence in the treatment of a diverse range of respiratory infections is
available for Angelica archangelica (16, 31), randomised human clinical trials are required to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICEP4 in COVID19 patients. Historical clinical evidence of
Angelica-related remedies in the treatment of respiratory syndromes, its safe toxicity profile, and
the appropriate range of therapeutic doses may lead to the use of ICEP4 as a prophylactic mucosalrelated non-systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy. In this view, and encouraged by WHO demands,
ICEP4 herbal drug may be suitable for complete drug development under the COVID19
regulatory pathway.

Figure 2. Cytotoxicity assay graphic representation. Shown data were collected at 27/07/2020
(first replicate). Columns are divided as indicated in experimental design. Blue-coloured dots
represents viable cells. White-coloured dots represents unviable cells (dead). Note this replica had
a TCID50 control weak (not kill 50% of Vero E6 cells). This example is shown to observe the
marked cytoprotective effect in WPD2 and WPD3 columns comparing to 10-fold viral load
positive control (100% of cellular death). No dose related WP D1, D2 and D3 cytotoxicity was
observed on epithelial-derived Vero E6 cells (ICEP4 raw material, columns 5, 6 and 7).

Figure 3. Effect of ICEP4 on cellular viability of M0 macrophages, B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T
lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) and Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. Bone marrow derived
macrophages (M0) or mouse splenocytes were incubated with different compound
concentrations for 24h. Subsequently, the percentage of viable cells was determined using
antibodies specific for T, B, NK and NKT cells and Annexin V staining as indicated in methods
section. For M0 macrophages cell viability was measured by Presto BlueTM assay. Individual
points represent the mean value ±SD of 3 independent experiments.
