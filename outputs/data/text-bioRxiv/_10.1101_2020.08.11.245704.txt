Abstract

18
19

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency.

20

The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines.

21

In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a

22

prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central

23

helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG

24

1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P

25

was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in

26

eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum

27

hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies

28

in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-

29

CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition,

30

the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G

31

variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted

32

from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related

33

serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens

34

with up to 50 μg of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued

35

development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-

36

19 disease.

Introduction

38
39

COVID-19 was first identified as a cause of severe pneumonia cases in December 2019 in association with

40

a seafood market in Wuhan, China [1]. The viral agent was identified as a novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-

41

CoV-2) most closely related to bat coronavirus [1]. In the six months since its first appearance, SARS-CoV-2

42

has become the largest pandemic since the 1918 influenza with nearly 20 million infected and over 700,000

43

deaths worldwide as of August 2020 [2, 3]. The rapid spread and huge socioeconomic impact of this pandemic

44

require the urgent development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines. In response, pharmaceuticals,

45

academia, and institutions are developing vaccines and drugs at an unprecedented pace with governments and

46

foundations pledging hundreds of millions of dollars for COVID-19 research [4].

47
48

In addition to basic public health control measures such as social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine,

49

a safe and effective vaccine is the only weapon that can potentially offer lasting protection against COVID-19

50

and stop the current pandemic. According to the WHO, 26 vaccine candidates using various platforms have

51

entered clinical trials as of July 31, 2020 [5]. These candidate vaccines have all been developed in compliance

52

with WHO guidelines that define desired characteristics such as dose regimen, target population, safety,

53

measures of efficacy, and requirements for product stability and storage [6].

54
55

Coronaviruses are among the largest known enveloped RNA viruses and cause respiratory illnesses in

56

humans ranging from the common cold to SARS, MERS, as well as the current COVID-19 pandemic [7].

57

Similar to SARS-CoV, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the receptor for attachment and cell entry via

58

the cellular receptor hACE2 [1]. Researchers are also adapting antigen design strategies used for SARS-CoV

59

and MERS-CoV spike proteins to develop a candidate vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. A stabilized prefusion form

60

of the MERS spike protein was achieved in 2017 by transferring two proline substitutions between heptad repeat

61

1 and the central helix analogous to those defined in the HKU1 spike protein. These mutations together with a

62

C-terminus foldon trimerization domain stabilized the spike ectodomain in its prefusion state resulting in a more

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.245704; this version posted August 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

63

potent immunogen with dose-sparing properties compared to protein made with the original wild-type sequence

64

[8]. The analogous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike resulted in a homogeneous population of proteins

65

allowing the atomic-level structure to be solved by cryo-electron microscopy [9].

66
67

Subunit vaccines such as the spike protein are often poorly immunogenic by themselves and therefore

68

typically require adjuvants to enhance their ability to produce an immune response [10]. Adjuvants can be

69

classified based on their properties into several categories, including aluminum salt-based (aluminum hydroxide

70

and aluminum phosphate), oil emulsion-based such MF59 and AS03, and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists,

71

including CpG 1018 and monophosphoryl lipid A (AS04) [11]. A previous study employing four different

72

candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV, all of them with and without alum adjuvants successfully elicited

73

neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against infection; however, tissue damage due to

74

immunopathology was also observed from infiltrating lymphocytes [12]. Historical evidence from animal

75

models suggests, vaccine-primed Th2 and Th17 responses may be associated with immunopathology referred

76

to as vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) [13]; therefore, extra caution must be taken in

77

the choice of adjuvants. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides with CpG motifs (CpG ODN) are agonists for TLR9

78

and mimic the activity of naturally occurring CpG motifs found in bacterial DNA. CpG ODN are potent vaccine

79

adjuvants generating Th1-biased responses, thus making them a good choice to mitigate potential Th2 and Th17

80

induced immunopathology [11]. CpG 1018, a 22-mer CpG ODN containing sequence with a modified

81

phosphorothioate backbone [14], is the adjuvant used in the licensed hepatitis B vaccine HEPLISAV-B® , and

82

is the only TLR9 agonist used in an approved vaccine.

83
84

In this study, we present data from preclinical studies aimed at developing a COVID-19 candidate subunit

85

vaccine using CHO cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S-2P antigen combined with various adjuvants. We have

86

shown that S-2P, when mixed with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide adjuvants, was most effective in

87

inducing antibodies that neutralized pseudovirus and wild-type live virus while minimizing Th2-biased

88

responses with no vaccine-related adverse effects.

Materials and Methods

90
91

Production of S-2P protein ectodomains from Expi293 and ExpiCHO-S cells

92

The plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 (strain Wuhan-Hu-1 GenBank: MN908947) S protein ectodomain

93

was obtained from Dr. Barney S. Graham (Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious

94

Diseases, USA) and contains a mammalian-codon-optimized gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 S residues 1–1208

95

with a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain, an HRV3C cleavage site, an 8×His-tag and a Twin-Strep-

96

tag [9]. The S-2P form was created by mutation of the S1/S2 furin-recognition site 682-RRAR-685 to GSAS to

97

produce a single-chain S0 protein, and the 986-KV-987 was mutated to PP [9].

98

Expi293 and ExpiCHO-S cells (ThermoFisher) were transfected with the plasmid expressing S-2P protein

99

ectodomains by ExpiFectamine 293 transfection kit and ExpiFectamine CHO transfection kit (ThermoFisher),

100

respectively. The secreted S-2P protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Purification tags were

101

removed by HRV3C protease digestion and the S-2P protein was further purified. The purified S-2P proteins

102

produced from Expi293 and ExpiCHO-S cells were quantified by BCA assay (ThermoFisher), flash frozen in

103

liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C. The ExpiCHO-expressed S-2P were sent to the Electronic Microscopy

104

Laboratory at the Advanced Technology Research Facility (National Cancer Institute) for cryo-EM

105

confirmation.

106
107

Pseudovirus production and titration

108

To produce SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, a plasmid expressing full-length wild-type Wuhan-Hu-1 strain

109

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was cotransfected into HEK293T cells with packaging and reporter plasmids

110

pCMVΔ8.91 and pLAS2w.FLuc.Ppuro (RNAi Core, Academia Sinica), using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent

111

(Mirus Bio). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the D614G variant by changing nucleotide at

112

position 23403 (Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain) from A to G. Mock pseudoviruses were produced by omitting

113

the p2019-nCoV spike (WT). Seventy-two hours post-transfection, supernatants were collected, filtered, and

114

frozen at −80 °C.The transduction unit (TU) of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus was estimated by using

115

cell viability assay in response to the limited dilution of lentivirus. In brief, HEK-293T cells stably expressing

116

human ACE2 gene were plated on 96-well plate one day before lentivirus transduction. For the titering of

117

pseudovirus, different amounts of pseudovirus were added into the culture medium containing polybrene. Spin

118

infection was carried out at 1,100 xg in 96-well plate for 30 minutes at 37°C. After incubating cells at 37°C for

119

16 hr, the culture medium containing virus and polybrene were removed and replaced with fresh complete

120

DMEM containing 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. After treating with puromycin for 48 hrs, the culture media was

121

removed and cell viability was detected by using 10% AlarmaBlue reagents according to manufacturer’s

122

instruction. The survival rate of uninfected cells (without puromycin treatment) was set as 100%. The virus titer

123

(transduction units) was determined by plotting the survival cells versus diluted viral dose.

124
125

Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay

126

HEK293-hAce2 cells (2x104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well white isoplates and incubated for overnight.

127

Sera were heated at 56°C for 30 min to inactivate complement and diluted in MEM supplemented with 2 %

128

FBS at an initial dilution factor of 20, and then 2-fold serial dilutions were carried out (for a total of 8 dilution

129

steps to a final dilution of 1:5120). The diluted sera were mixed with an equal volume of pseudovirus (1,000

130

TU) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr before adding to the plates with cells. After the 1-hr incubation, the culture

131

medium was replaced with 50 μL of fresh medium. On the following day, the culture medium was replaced

132

with 100 μL of fresh medium. Cells were lysed at 72 hours post infections and relative luciferase units (RLU)

133

was measured. The luciferase activity was detected by Tecan i-control (Infinite 500). The 50% and 90%

134

inhibition dilution titers (ID50 and ID90) were calculated considering uninfected cells as 100% neutralization and

135

cells transduced with only virus as 0% neutralization. Reciprocal ID50 and ID90 geometric mean titers (GMT)

136

were both determined as ID90 titers are useful when ID50 titer levels are consistently saturating at the upper limit

137

of detection.

140

The neutralization assay with SARS-CoV-2 virus was conducted as previously reported [15]. Vero E6 cells

141

(2.5x104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated overnight. Sera were heated at 56°C for 30 min

142

to inactivate complement and diluted in serum-free MEM at an initial dilution factor of 20, and then further 2-

143

fold serial dilutions were performed for a total 11 dilution steps to a final dilution of 1:40960. The diluted sera

144

were mixed with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 virus at 100 TCID50/50 μL (hCoV-19/Taiwan/CGMH-CGU-

145

01/2020, GenBank accession MT192759) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 hr. The sera-virus mixture was then

146

added to 96-well plate with Vero E6 cells and incubated in MEM with 2% FBS at 37 °C for 5 days. After

147

incubation, cells were fixed by adding 4% formalin to each of the wells for 10 min and stained with 0.1% crystal

148

violet for visualization. Results were calculated with the Reed-Muench method for log 50% end point for ID50

149

and log 90% end point for ID90 titers.

Immunization of mice

159

For antigen formulation, 0.5 mL of SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein was mixed with either an equal volume of

160

Sigma Adjuvant System S6322 (Sigma), 600 μg/mL Adju-Phos aluminum phosphate (Brenntag), CpG 1018

161

(200 μg/mL), aluminum hydroxide (1 mg/mL), PBS, or 0.25 mL CpG 1018 (400 μg/mL) plus 0.25 mL

162

aluminum hydroxide (2 mg/mL). Female BALB/cJ mice aged 6–9 weeks were immunized twice at 3 weeks

163

apart as previously described [8]. Total serum anti-S IgG levels were detected with direct ELISA using custom

164

96-well plates coated with S-2P antigen.

Cytokine assays

167

Two weeks after the second injection, mice were euthanized and splenocytes were isolated and stimulated

168

with S-2P protein (2 μg/well) as previously described [16]. For detection of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5, the

169

culture supernatant from the 96-well microplates was harvested to analyze the levels of cytokines by ELISA

170

using Mouse IFN-γ Quantikine ELISA Kit, Mouse IL-2 Quantikine ELISA Kit, Mouse IL-4 Quantikine ELISA

171

Kit, and Mouse IL-5 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D System). The OD450 values were read by Multiskan GO

172

(ThermoFisher).

Dose range finding study for single and repeat-dose intramuscular injection (IM) in Sprague Dawley

175

(SD) Rats

176

To investigate the safety of SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein adjuvanted with CpG 1018 alone or combined with

177

aluminum hydroxide, pilot toxicity studies were conducted for dose range finding. SD rats aged 6-8 weeks were

178

immunized with 5 μg, 25 μg or 50 μg of S-2P adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 combined

179

with aluminum hydroxide. The test article or vehicle control was administered intramuscularly to each rat on

180

Day 1 (for single-dose study) and Day 15 (for repeat-dose study). The observation period was 14 days (for

181

single-dose study) and 28 days (for repeat-dose study). Parameters evaluated included clinical signs, local

182

irritation examination, moribundity/mortality, body temperature, body weights, and food consumption during

183

the in-life period. Blood samples were taken for hematology, including coagulation tests and serum chemistry.

184

All animals were euthanized and necropsied for gross lesion examination, organ weights, and histopathology

Results

196
197

Adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 S-2P induced robust neutralizing antibodies

198

Sera of BALB/cJ mice vaccinated with HEK293-expressed S-2P with or without adjuvants were assessed

199

using pseudovirus neutralization assays for immunogenicity elicited by S-2P antigen. Reciprocal ID50 and ID90

200

geometric mean titers (GMT) were determined as ID90 titer is useful when ID50 titer levels are consistently

201

saturating at the upper limit of detection. At 1 µg of S-2P, the ID50 titers of S-2P alone, with aluminum phosphate,

202

and with Sigma Adjuvant were 259, 2,124, and 5,099, respectively; whereas the ID90 titers of the above were

203

41, 282, and 2007, respectively (Figure S1).

204

Additional immunogenicity studies were conducted to test the adjuvanted vaccine in different antigen

205

dosages. Similar results were obtained as in the previous experiment (Figure S2). Likewise, both ID50 and ID90

206

titers induced by higher antigen dose was stronger than that induced by lower antigen dose. Taken together,

207

these data again confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 S-2P combined with adjuvants induced effective neutralizing

208

antibody, thus indicating early potential and preliminary evidence to pursue development of this candidate

209

COVID-19 vaccine.

210
211

Induction of potent neutralizing antibodies by CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted S-2P

212

Having established the ability of Expi293-expressed S-2P to induce neutralizing antibodies, we then

213

applied ExpiCHO as the expression system of S-2P antigen for clinical studies and stable clones for commercial

214

production. The S-2P proteins produced in CHO cells and their structure displayed typical spike trimers under

215

cryo-EM (Figure S3), resembling that of Expi293-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting that CHO cells

216

are feasible in production of S-2P. The above immunogenicity studies showed that the oil in water adjuvant

217

(Sigma adjuvant) vaccinated S-2P could induce effective neutralizing antibody in mice. However, since Sigma

218

adjuvant is not permitted for human therapeutic use and the potential of alum salts in producing Th2-mediated

219

immunopathology, we next examined the potential of Th1-biasing CpG 1018 for clinical use. Aluminum

220

hydroxide was also explored in the following experiment instead of aluminum phosphate as it has been

221

characterized to enhance the potency of CpG adjuvant when used in combination while also retaining the

222

property of inducing Th1 responses [17]. The pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed with sera drawn

223

two weeks after the second injection. At 1 µg of S-2P, the reciprocal ID50 GMT of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG

224

1018, aluminum hydroxide, and with both CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide were 245, 3,109, and 5,120,

225

respectively (Figure 1). Similar values were obtained at 5 µg of S-2P (Figure 1). Weaker neutralization titers

226

were observed at 3 weeks after the first injection (Figure S4). Sera from these mice were then examined for the

227

amount of anti-S IgG. CpG 1018 in combination with aluminum hydroxide produced significantly higher titers

228

of anti-S IgG compared to CpG 1018 or aluminum hydroxide alone (Figure 2). The immune sera were further

229

tested for their neutralization capabilities against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in a neutralization assay. S-2P was

230

able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 1 µg, although at lower potency than that of pseudovirus

231

(Figures 1 and 3). The reciprocal ID50 GMT of S-2P in the presence of CpG 1018, aluminum hydroxide, and

232

with both CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide were approximately 60, 250, and 1,500, respectively (Figure 3).

233

Pseudovirus carrying the current dominant D614G variant spike was also generated and neutralizing antibodies

234

from mice immunized with S-2P with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide were effective against both

235

pseudoviruses carrying the wild-type D614 and mutant D614G versions of spike proteins (Figure 4).

236

Neutralization titers of wild-type virus and pseudovirus and total anti-S IgG titers were all found to be highly

237

correlated with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 (Figure 5).

238
239

CpG 1018 induced Th1 immunity

240

To identify whether CpG 1018 could induce Th1 responses in our vaccine-adjuvant system, cytokines

241

involved in Th1 and Th2 responses were measured in splenocytes from mice immunized with S-2P with

242

aluminum hydroxide, CpG 1018, or combination of the two. As expected, S-2P adjuvanted with aluminum

hydroxide induced limited amounts of IFN-andLthe representative cytokines of Th1 response. In contrast,

244

significant increases in IFN- and IL-2 were detected most strongly in high antigen dose plus CpG 1018 and

245

aluminum hydroxide (Figure 6). For Th2 response, while the levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 increased in the

246

presence of aluminum hydroxide and S-2P, addition of CpG 1018 to aluminum hydroxide suppressed the levels

247

of these cytokines (Figure 7). IFN-γ/IL-4, IFN-γ/IL-5, and IFN-γ/IL-6 ratios are strongly indicative of a Th1-

248

biased response and were increased by approximately 36-, 130-, and 2-fold, respectively, in the presence of S-

249

2P combined with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (Figure 8). These results suggested that the effect of

250

CpG 1018 is dominant over aluminum hydroxide in directing the cell-mediated response towards Th1 response,

251

while retaining high antibody levels.

252
253

S-2P did not result in systemic adverse effects in rats

254

To elucidate the safety and potential toxicity of the vaccine candidate, 5 μg, 25 μg or 50 μg of S-2P

255

adjuvanted with CpG 1018 or CpG 1018 combined aluminum hydroxide were administered to SD rats for

256

single-dose and repeat-dose studies. No mortality, abnormality of clinical signs, differences in body weight

257

changes, body temperature, nor food consumption were observed in either gender that could be attributed to S-

258

2P (with or without adjuvant) with single dose administration (Figures 9 and 10). Increased body temperature

259

at 4-hr or 24-hr after dosing was found in both genders of single-dose study and repeat-dose study; however,

260

these temperature changes were moderate and were recovered after 48-hr in both genders of all treated groups

261

including controls (PBS) (Figure 9). No gross lesions were observed in organs of most of the male and female

262

rats with single-dose and two-dose administration, except for one male rat which was deemed to be non-vaccine-

263

related. In conclusion, S-2P protein, with CpG 1018 or CpG 1018 + aluminum hydroxide as adjuvants

264

administrated intramuscularly once or twice to SD rats did not induce any systemic adverse effect.

Discussion

267
268

In this study, we showed that in mice, two injections of a subunit vaccine consisting of the prefusion spike

269

protein (S-2P) adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide was effective in inducing potent

270

neutralization activity against both pseudovirus expressing wild-type and D614G variant spike proteins, and

271

wild-type SARS-CoV-2. The combination of S-2P with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide elicited Th1-

272

dominant immune responses with high neutralizing antibody levels in mice and showed no major adverse effects

273

in rats. We also successfully scaled-up yield of S-2P by establishing stable CHO cell clones expressing S-2P

274

protein and improved the purification process at a sufficient quantity of antigen for the production of a

275

commercial vaccine. Spike is a highly glycosylated protein and we chose CHO-cell production to achieve

276

mammalian glycosylation patterns that will include complex glycans and may be important for immunogenicity.

277

Although the leading subunit protein COVID-19 vaccines by developers such as Sanofi Pasteur and Novavax

278

are made in baculovirus, the insect cell produce protein with man-9 glycosylation that may be sufficient for

279

immune response induction, but may not recapitulate the antigenicity of virus grown in mammalian cells [5, 18-

280

19]. Animal challenge studies will be conducted at a future date to examine the safety and efficacy of our

281

candidate vaccine. Based on our results and in accordance with the International Coalition of Medicines

282

Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), we plan to move forward with first-in-human clinical trials and conduct

283

preclinical studies in parallel to expedite vaccine development in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

284
285

We have successfully shown robust immunogenicity elicited by adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 S-2 (Figures 1,

286

2, S1, and S2). Much stronger neutralizing antibody responses were detected in mice when 1 g or 5 g of S-

287

2P protein was adjuvanted with 10 g of CpG 1018 and 50 g of aluminum hydroxide than with either adjuvant

288

alone (Figure 1). S-2P in conjunction with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide induced potent anti-S antibodies

289

that were effective against wild-type virus (Figures 2 and 3). We have shown that high degrees of correlation

290

between neutralization titers of pseudovirus, wild-type virus, and anti-S IgG titers (Figure 5), raising the

291

potential that anti-S IgG titer could be used as surrogate for vaccine potency instead of performing pseudovirus

292

or wild-type virus assays. During the course of vaccine development against fast-evolving RNA viruses such as

293

SARS-CoV-2, it is important that the protection offered by the vaccine could extend to variants that could

294

otherwise drastically reduce the effectiveness of neutralizing antibody. Strains harboring the D614G mutation

295

in the spike protein were first observed in Europe in February 2020 and overtime has become the global

296

dominant variant [20]. Our results of the pseudovirus neutralization assay showed cross-reaction of these

297

antibodies with the dominant circulating stain D614G with similar titer levels (Figure 4). Therefore, we

298

confirmed that S-2P was able to generate antibodies effective against both the original wild-type strain and its

299

variant. Neutralization titers of antibodies against different strains of wild-type viruses should be investigated

300

in the future, but our results indicate the potential of this candidate vaccine to provide broad spectrum protection

301

against COVID-19 infection.

302
303

Although moderate IL-4 production was detected in mice receiving 5 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018

304

and aluminum hydroxide, the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio was 16-fold higher than those receiving 5 g of S-2P adjuvanted

305

with aluminum hydroxide alone. These results suggested that CpG 1018, even in the presence of aluminum

306

hydroxide could steer the immune response away from Th2 to a Th1 response. Moreover, these mice produce a

307

limited amount of IL-5, which is a key mediator in eosinophil activation and major regulator of eosinophil

308

accumulation in tissues [21]. Previous studies showed that the lung-infiltrating eosinophils were a common

309

indication of Th2-biased immune responses seen in animal models testing SARS-CoV vaccine candidates [22].

310

The finding that IL-5 production was inhibited by the S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 plus aluminum hydroxide

311

suggests that it would be less likely to induce immune responses resulting in eosinophil infiltration in lung. Th1

312

and Th2-biased responses are determined by factors, including administration routes, antigen and adjuvant

313

characteristics, and cytokines [11]. Our results showed that S-2P per se is unlikely to skew the immune response

314

towards Th1, but in the presence of an adjuvant such as CpG 1018, S-2P can direct the immune response towards

315

Th1. Thus, we have shown that S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 plus aluminum hydroxide is a potential

316

formulation for COVID-19 vaccine development.

317

Single-dose or repeat-dose administration of S-2P protein adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum

318

hydroxide was well tolerated in rats in both genders, supporting human clinical trials in young healthy adults.

319

GLP toxicology study of S-2P in combination of higher dose of CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide will be

320

conducted to explore safety of the formulated S-2P for dose escalation study in human clinical trials with the

321

elderly and those with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, who may require

322

a higher adjuvant dose to boost the immune systems. As a two-dose regimen of S-2P formulated with CpG 1018

323

and aluminum hydroxide induced potent neutralizing activity, our future plans will include testing single-dose

324

regimens.

325

Our study showed that CHO-derived S-2P proteins elicited robust immune responses in mice, indicating

326

that CHO cell is an appropriate platform for stable S-2P production in vaccine development. Other vaccines

327

using CHO cells to produce antigens include hepatitis B vaccines GenHevacB and Sci-B-Vac [23]. To this date,

328

we have established stable CHO cell clones expressing S-2P and the one with the highest yield will be selected

329

to produce master cell bank for large scale GMP production of commercial vaccine.

330
331

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and urgent need for an effective vaccine call for its development using

332

readily available and proven technologies. The spike protein is the main receptor binding and membrane fusion

333

protein, which serves as the major antigen target for COVID-19 vaccine development. We have demonstrated

334

in this study that the S-2P combined with the advanced adjuvant CpG 1018, the adjuvant contained in the FDA-

335

approved adult hepatitis B vaccine (HEPLISAV-B), in combination with aluminum hydroxide induced potent

336

Th1-biased immune responses to prevent wild-type virus infections while retaining high antibody levels that

337

show cross-neutralization of variant viruses. Therefore, this vaccine formulation serves as an ideal vaccine

338

candidate in alleviating the burden of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Figure S1. Immunogenicity elicited by adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 S-2P. BALB/c mice were immunized with

480

2 injections of HEK 293 cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S-2P alone or combined with various adjuvants 3 weeks apart

481

and the antisera were harvested at 2 weeks after the second injection. The antisera were subjected to a neutralization

482

assay with pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to determine the ID50 (left) and ID90 (right) titers of

483

neutralization antibodies.
