Summary

The airway epithelium is a key protective barrier whose integrity is preserved by the selfrenewal and differentiation of basal progenitor cells. Epithelial cells are central to the
pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. In chronic diseases, increasing age is a principle risk
factor. In acute diseases, such as COVID-19, children suffer less severe symptoms than adults
and have a lower rate of mortality. Few studies have explored differences between airway
epithelial cells in children and adults to explain this age dependent variation in diseases. Here,
we perform bulk RNA sequencing studies in laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium,
FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells, as well as in vitro cell proliferation
experiments, to address the intrinsic molecular differences between paediatric and adult
airway basal cells. We find that, while the cellular composition of the paediatric and adult
tracheobronchial epithelium is broadly similar, in cell culture, paediatric airway epithelial cells
displayed higher colony forming ability, better in vitro growth and outcompeted adult cells in
competitive proliferation assays. In RNA sequencing experiments, we observed potentially
important differences in airway epithelial gene expression between samples from children and
adults. However, genes known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were not
differentially expressed between children and adults. Our results chart cell-intrinsic differences
in transcriptional profile and regenerative capacity between proximal airway epithelial cells of
children and adults.

Introduction

The human airways are lined by a pseudostratified epithelium from the trachea through most
of the 16 generations of conducting airway branching. Functionally, the epithelium secretes a
mucous layer and produces motile force to flow mucus proximally out of the lungs, providing
protection against noxious particles and pathogens. These specialized functions are
accomplished by luminal mucosecretory and ciliated epithelial cells, respectively. The
differentiated cell types in this slow-turnover tissue are replenished by airway basal cells, which
act as multipotent progenitors (Rock et al., 2010; Teixeira et al., 2013).
The cellular composition of the airway is being mapped in ever more detail through single cell
RNA sequencing approaches. A novel CFTR-producing population, the ionocyte (Montoro et
al., 2018; Plasschaert et al., 2018), has been described, and we have new insight into cellular
differentiation through the resolution of differentiation intermediates; for example, basal
luminal progenitor cells (Mori et al., 2015; Rock et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2015), which are
defined by an intermediate keratin profile (TP63-/KRT5+/KRT8+/KRT4+/KRT13+) (Braga et al.,
2019; García et al., 2019). Efforts in mapping pathologic states have identified mucous ciliated
cells (ciliated cells which co-express a number of genes typically associated with goblet cells
and are more frequent in asthmatic patients (Braga et al., 2019)), as well as novel pathological
epithelial cell subtypes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Adams et al., 2019; Habermann et al.,
2019; Reyfman et al., 2019). In addition, region-specific differences exist in airway epithelial
cell phenotype within the bronchial tree such that basal, ciliated and secretory populations in
the nasal epithelium differ phenotypically (and maybe functionally) from their counterparts in
the large or small airways (Braga et al., 2019; Deprez et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2011; Travaglini
et al., 2019). However, despite well-characterized structural and functional consequences of
ageing in the distal lung (Navarro and Driscoll, 2017; Thurlbeck and Angus, 1975; Turner et al.,
1968), little is known about alterations in human airway epithelial cell composition or function
between paediatric and adult tissue. The importance of age-related epithelial variation has
been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where functional differences in airway
predisposition to viral infection and response have had a major clinical impact.
Single cell RNA sequencing studies have shown that increased transcriptional noise and
upregulation of a core group of age-associated molecular mechanisms – including protein

processing- and inflammation-associated genes – are correlated with ageing across mouse cell
and tissue types, but additional processes are unique to particular cell types within specific
organs, including the lungs (Angelidis et al., 2019; Kimmel et al., 2019). However, to date such
studies have not profiled the trachea, which has distinct composition and stem cell biology to
the more distal airways (Basil et al., 2020), in detail. During murine tracheal ageing, epithelial
cell density is reduced and the proportion of basal cells within the epithelium is slightly
decreased, but there is no obvious decline in their in vitro clonogenic potential or
differentiation capacity (Wansleeben et al., 2014). However, microarray gene expression
analysis shows changes consistent with the development of low-grade chronic inflammation
in older mice, together with an increased presence of activated adaptive immune cells
(Wansleeben et al., 2014).
There are striking differences in airway structure and composition between rodents and
humans (Hogan et al., 2014), which suggests that the effects of ageing on airway epithelial
regeneration might differ substantially between species. Careful characterization of human
paediatric and adult airway epithelial cell composition and function will both inform lung
regenerative medicine efforts and potential pathogenic mechanisms behind multiple chronic
lung disease pathologies (Kicic et al., 2006; Prasse et al., 2018; Staudt et al., 2014), as age is a
risk factor for COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, infection and lung cancer. In all such cases, basal stem
cell dysfunction, perhaps accelerated by smoking, is likely to play a role in disease pathogenesis
(Meiners et al., 2015).
Here, we compare paediatric and adult human tracheobronchial epithelia in terms of cellular
composition, gene expression profiles and behaviour in primary cell culture. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we compare expression of epithelial viral infection-associated
genes, including those so far linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and make our data available as a
resource for the community.

Results

Human tracheobronchial epithelium has comparable cellular composition in children and
adults

In mouse trachea, the proportion of the epithelium that expresses the basal cell-associated
protein keratin 5 (KRT5) decreases with age (Wansleeben et al., 2014), so we first compared
the cellular composition of steady state normal human airway epithelium using haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry for TP63 (basal cells), MUC5AC
(mucosecretory cells) and FOXJ1 (ciliated cells) in tracheobronchial biopsies (Figure 1A/1B;
donor characteristics are listed in Table S1). We found no significant differences in the
proportion of cells in these three cellular compartments in paediatric and adult biopsies either
by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1A/1B), or by assessing basal, mucosecretory or ciliated cellassociated gene expression (Table S2) in bulk RNA sequencing in which we had laser-capture
microdissected the whole epithelium (Figure 1C; Figure S1).
Analysing this laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium RNA sequencing dataset using
DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% and log2 fold change
threshold of 1.2, we identified 37 genes with significant differential expression between
paediatric and adult donors of which 17 were upregulated in adults and 20 were expressed at
higher levels in children (Figure 2A; Table S3). To determine alterations in biologically
functional gene groups, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Hallmark
gene sets from MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2015; Subramanian et al., 2005). In the paediatric
airway epithelium, this demonstrated a higher expression of genes associated with interferon
alpha and gamma responses. In adults, there was a higher expression of genes associated with
TP53, TGFβ and Wnt-β-catenin signalling, as well as processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and glycolysis (Figure 2B). Although broad transcriptional similarities are expected
within the same tissue between childhood and adulthood, these differences in gene expression
may be functionally important.

Basal cells from children proliferate more readily in primary cell culture than those from
adults

To investigate possible differences in regenerative potential between paediatric and adult
proximal airway basal cells, we established primary cell cultures. First, we FACS-sorted single
basal cells, identified by dual EpCAM (epithelial) and podoplanin (PDPN; basal (Miller et al.,
2018; Weeden et al., 2017)) positivity, into individual wells of 96-well plates (range = 167 to
192 cells per donor) to compare the clonal potential of native paediatric and adult basal cells.
After 7 days of culture in epithelial cell culture medium containing Y-27632, colony formation
was significantly higher among basal cells derived from children than adults (Figure 3A),
consistent with our previous work (Yoshida et al., 2020). At this timepoint, paediatric basal cells
had often generated colonies that had become confluent to fill the well, whereas no adult
colonies reached confluence (Figure 3B/3C).
When cells were isolated and cultured in epithelial cell culture medium without Y-27632 on
3T3-J2 feeder layers, expansion of paediatric and adult cells proceeded similarly at early
passages but a growth advantage was observed in paediatric donors after 5 passages (Figure
3D). In MTT assays, cultured paediatric cells showed greater proliferation than adult cells after
5 and 7 days (Figure 3E). Likewise, differences in EdU uptake (Figure 3F) and Ki67-positivity
(Figure 3G) were seen in passage 1 cell cultures in the presence of feeder cells. When cultured
basal cells were assessed in colony formation assays, there was a trend towards paediatric cells
forming more colonies than adult cells (Figure 3H).

Basal cells from children outcompete those from adults in mixed cultures

To better understand progenitor capacity, we next developed a competitive proliferation assay
(Figure S2), using lentiviral cell labelling with fluorescent constructs (Eekels et al., 2012). After
optimization in 293T cells to ensure that the two lentiviruses did not affect cell growth (Figure
S3), we isolated and cultured patient basal cells in epithelial cell culture medium containing Y27632 to facilitate lentiviral transduction (Horani et al., 2013) and transduced these with either
with green fluorescent protein (GFP)- or mCherry-expressing lentiviral constructs (Figure 4A).
When combining GFP+ and mCherry+ cells from the same donor in equal number, the ratio
remained 1:1 over 7 days (Figure S4). After transducing three paediatric and four adult basal
cell cultures in this manner, we combined each paediatric donor with each adult donor in both
possible colour combinations so that we could monitor the growth dynamics of the two
populations separately using fluorescence (Figure 4B/4C). There were no differences in
lentiviral integration as determined by PCR targeting the puromycin resistance gene contained
within both GFP and mCherry lentiviral vectors (Figure S4E). When cells were harvested at
approximately 80% confluence, the growth differential between paediatric cells and adult cells
was calculated for each paediatric/adult pair. In almost all donor pairs, the paediatric cells
outgrew the adult cells (Figure 4D). Interestingly, the pairings that did not follow this pattern
involved the youngest adult donor, who was 30 years of age.

Cultured basal cells demonstrate greater age-related transcriptional differences than basal
cells in vivo

Given the different behaviour and phenotype of cultured basal cells from children and adults
observed in vitro, we assessed whether these changes correlate with gene expression
differences in native basal cells. We used FACS to isolate EpCAM+/PDPN+ basal cells (Miller et
al., 2018; Weeden et al., 2017) directly from tracheal biopsies and performed bulk RNA
sequencing. Consistent with successful purification of basal cells, we saw enrichment for basal
cell-associated gene expression in this dataset compared to the laser-capture microdissected
whole epithelium (Figure S5A). Using DESeq2 with an FDR of 1% and log2 fold change threshold
of 1.2, we identified 32 genes with significant differential expression between basal cells sorted
from paediatric and adult donors, of which 7 were upregulated in children and 25 were more
highly expressed in adults (Figure 5A; Table S3). NTRK2 has previously been associated with
basal cell function as it was upregulated in polyp versus non-polyp basal cells in human nasal
basal epithelial cells (Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018). Here, it was upregulated in adult
compared to paediatric basal cells, consistent with a possible negative influence on basal cell
progenitor function. However, the majority of differentially expressed genes do not have
previously described roles in airway basal cells. GSEA suggested that pathways such as TNFα
and MTORC1 signalling, as well as processes such as inflammation and apoptosis, were higher
in paediatric basal cells although all pathways were of borderline statistical significance (Figure
5B).
Next, we asked whether cell culture differentially affected the transcriptome of paediatric and
adult tracheobronchial basal cells in a manner that might result in functional differences. We
performed bulk RNA sequencing on cultured basal cells that were isolated and expanded on
3T3-J2 mouse embryonic feeder cells in epithelial cell culture medium containing Y-27632. As
expected, cultured cells were enriched for basal cell-associated gene expression compared to
laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium (Figure S5A). Freshly sorted basal cells were
more similar to laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium than cultured basal cells (Figure
S5B), emphasising the significant impact of the artificial cell culture environment on the basal
cell transcriptome. Using DESeq2 with an FDR of 1% and log2 fold change threshold of 1.2, we
identified 983 genes with significant differential expression between basal cells sorted from

paediatric and adult donors, of which 554 were upregulated in children and 429 were more
highly expressed in adults (Figure 5C; Table S3). Notably, the mucins MUC2, MUC3A, MUC5AC,
MUC5B, and MUC17, as well as the secretory master regulator SPDEF, were all more highly
expressed by adult cultured basal cells than paediatric basal cells. In adult basal cell cultures,
we have previously observed upregulation of mucosecretory genes, such as SCGB3A1, in cells
co-cultured with mouse embryonic feeder cells in medium containing Y-27632 compared to
those in a serum-free alternative, bronchial epithelial growth medium (Butler et al., 2016).
However, even if mucosecretory gene expression is favoured in these conditions, it is unclear
why paediatric and adult epithelial cells differ in their response to culture. GSEA suggested
alterations in multiple pathways, some of which, including TNFα signalling and the
inflammatory response, were now in the opposite direction to what was seen in basal cells in
vivo (Figure 5D).

Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated genes is similar between human paediatric
and adult tracheobronchial epithelium

Airway epithelial cell types differ in their gene expression between the nasal and airway
epithelium (Deprez et al., 2019), and indeed between the proximal and distal airways
(Travaglini et al., 2019), potentially contributing to the region-variable infection pattern of the
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Sungnak et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020). However, this virus
also produces markedly less severe symptoms in paediatric than adult COVID-19 patients (Han
et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020). Upregulated type I and II interferon-associated gene expression in
children (Figure 2B) might be indicative of more effective anti-viral immunity whereas higher
Wnt pathway-associated gene expression in adults (Figure 2B) might be relevant since Wnt
activation has been shown to increase rates of influenza replication (More et al., 2018). To
further assess epithelial-intrinsic factors that might explain the disparity in symptom severity,
we compared the expression of a manually curated list of 99 genes associated with viral
infection in epithelial cells (Table S2) in our laser-capture microdissected whole
tracheobronchial epithelium dataset (Figure 6A). While there was heterogeneity of expression
in some of these genes between individuals, clustering was not seen by donor age (Figure 6A).
The entry of coronaviruses into host cells depends upon the binding of the viral spike (S)
protein to a host receptor and S protein priming by host proteases. It has been reported that
SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease for S priming, although
cathepsin L activity may also have a role (Hoffmann et al., 2020). While ACE2 and TMPRSS2
transcripts are found in adult nasal and airway goblet and ciliated cells (Bertram et al., 2012;
Sungnak et al., 2020), protein expression of ACE2 in particular seems to be low overall in airway
epithelium and restricted to rare cells (Aguiar et al., 2020; Hikmet et al., 2020). Moreover, it is
unclear whether these findings extend to paediatric nasal or airway epithelia. To address this,
we looked at the expression of these, and other candidate SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated
genes (Table S2), in laser-capture microdissected whole tracheobronchial epithelium.
Expression was equivalent between the paediatric and adult tissue, although ADAM17 – a gene
that is involved in ectodomain shedding of both EGFR ligands (Vallath et al., 2014) and ACE2 in
the context of SARS-CoV (Lambert et al., 2005) – neared statistical significance with higher
expression in adult epithelium (Figure 6B). We also determined the relative expression of these

genes compared to all other genes in each dataset, and found that, although ACE2 is detected
in each, it is typically in the midrange of transcripts detected (Figure 6C). Expression of all
candidate SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated genes was also comparable between children and
adults in our FACS-sorted basal cell (Figure S6) and cultured basal cell datasets (Figure S7),
although the lower n number in those experiments limits these analyses. We hope that these
RNA sequencing datasets (GEO accession number GSE148818) will be a useful resource for
investigations of COVID-19.

Discussion

In this study, we explored differences between human tracheobronchial basal cells in children
and adults in three bulk transcriptomic experiments; we compared laser-capture
microdissected whole epithelium, FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells. At the level
of the whole epithelium, there was broad conservation of airway epithelial transcriptional
programmes but notable differences in the expression of genes associated with interferon
responses and cell proliferation, which we speculate may lead to functional differences in
cellular behaviour. In support of this, epithelial cell culture showed that basal cells from
children have a greater colony forming capacity than those from adults. These data are
consistent with studies in other epithelia, where ageing reduces the proportion of cells
identified as stem cells using in vitro methodologies (Barrandon and Green, 1987). Such
differences in clonal potential and proliferative capacity of basal cells between children and
adults might be responsible for their differing repair responses following airway injury (Smith
et al., 2013), and is of relevance for lung regenerative medicine. For example, paediatric cells
might be more amenable to engraftment following transplantation, as is the case in bone
marrow transplantation, where donor age significantly affects outcomes (Kollman et al., 2001).
Although future airway epithelial cell therapies are likely to be predominantly required by older
people and be autologous in nature, recognising age-related differences in regenerative
capacity might allow the development of approaches that improve the culture and
transplantation of aged basal cells. Further, corrective gene and cell therapies in the context
of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (Vaidyanathan et al., 2020) might be more efficient if
performed early in life, when cultured cells have greater progenitor potential.
Basal cell-specific RNA sequencing revealed few differences in gene expression between
paediatric and adult tracheobronchial basal cells in vivo that might explain the differences in
their proliferative capacity once cultured, although the role of many differentially expressed
genes has not been determined in respiratory epithelial cells. Upon culture, new differences
between paediatric and adult basal cells emerged, suggesting that cells from donors of
different ages might respond differently to cell culture. This would be consistent with
paediatric cultures being more proliferative and typically proliferating for longer time periods
than their adult counterparts in population doubling assays. The mechanisms by which airway

basal cells lose their in vitro proliferative capacity with age, and whether this reflects in vivo
loss of progenitor capacity are important areas for further study.
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it has been observed that children suffer less severe
symptoms than adult patients. There has been speculation that this might be due to their lower
expression levels of the viral entry receptor, ACE2. Our results imply that there are no major
differences in the epithelial expression of viral infection-associated genes between children
and adults in the proximal airways, and suggest that expression of ACE2 and other genes
implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry are also comparable. Of course, there are multiple caveats:
investigating nasal epithelium may reveal differences that are not present in the
tracheobronchial epithelium since both COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients
show a greater viral yield in nasal samples than throat samples (Zhou et al., 2020), our RNA
sequencing studies did not include donors over the age of 72 who have a higher COVID-19
morbidity and mortality risk, and future single cell RNA sequencing of blood or nasal epithelial
brush biopsies might reveal differences in immune cell phenotype or viral response that we
could not detect here. Thus far, human adult lung single cell RNA sequencing has been used in
attempts to correlate ACE2 biology with clinical observations during the current outbreak of
COVID-19 (Sungnak et al., 2020). However, the relative lack of symptoms in paediatric COVID19 patients justifies accelerated efforts to map human paediatric nasal and lung cells to
facilitate comparisons with these adult samples.
It is possible to culture large numbers of airway epithelial cells in these and other cell culture
conditions (Butler et al., 2016; Peters-Hall et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Airway basal cells
might be candidates for in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2, which would minimize issues arising
as a result of physiological differences with cell lines derived from other organs and/or species
(Poon et al., 2005). Although we detected transcripts for genes associated with viral uptake in
2D primary cultured human tracheobronchial basal cells, other studies have shown that airway
basal cells in another medium composition do not express ACE2 protein (Aguiar et al., 2020)
so this requires validation at the protein level. Nevertheless, cell culture conditions alter basal
cell gene expression more significantly than inter-patient variability (Butler et al., 2016), so
comparing ACE2 protein expression across basal cell culture systems might be of interest. Basal
cells can also be differentiated towards mucosecretory and ciliated lineages in scalable air-

Materials and methods

Patient samples
Ethical approval to obtain patient tracheobronchial biopsies was granted by the National
Research Ethics Committee (REC references 11/LO/1522 and 06/Q0505/12) and patients (or
their parents) gave informed, written consent. Luminal biopsies were obtained using cupped
biopsy forceps from patients undergoing planned rigid laryngotracheobronchoscopy under
general anaesthesia or flexible bronchoscopy under sedation. Patient characteristics,
procedure indication and precise site of biopsy are included in Table S1.
Histology
Samples for histology were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) before being
dehydrated through an ethanol gradient using a Leica TP 1050 vacuum tissue processor.
Samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 µm thickness using a microtome.
Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed using an automated system (Tissue-Tek
DRS, Sakura). Immunohistochemistry was performed by The Queen Mary University of London
Barts Cancer Institute Pathology Service using the Ventana DabMap Horseradish Peroxidase
Kit. Stained slides were scanned using a Nanozoomer Whole Slide Imager (Hamamatsu
Photonics) to create virtual slides using NDP.View2 software. For cell type quantification,
images of sections that contained areas of intact epithelium with at least 300 cells were used
(overall 1 – 6 slides were assessed per donor). Images were reviewed in Fiji software and
positively stained cells counted using the cell count function. In total, 12,568 (TP63), 9,651
(MUC5AC) and 16,144 (FOXJ1) cells were assessed for expression of these proteins.
Bulk RNA sequencing of tracheobronchial epithelium
Bronchoscopic biopsies were frozen immediately in optimal cutting temperature compound
(OCT; in liquid hexane or on dry ice) and transported to a histopathology laboratory (Great
Ormond Street Children’s Hospital, London, U.K.) within 2 hours on dry ice. Blocks and cut
slides were stored at -80°C prior to use. 10 μm sections were mounted on MembraneSlide 1.0
PEN (D) membrane covered slides (Zeiss). One H&E slide was cut per block to aid navigation
and identification of epithelium and basement membrane. Slides were prepared with serial
washes in methanol, RNAse-free water, RNAse inhibitor and ethanol to remove residual OCT.
Laser capture microdissection was performed using a PALM MicroBeam 4 Laser

Microdissection microscope at 10x and 20x magnification (Figure S1) to extract the epithelial
portion (or all cells above the basement membrane) from each biopsy into microadhesivecapped tubes (Zeiss). Samples were suspended in a 2:1 mix of Arcturus PicoPure Extraction
buffer: RNAlater (Life Technologies) and stored at -80°C until use.
For RNA extraction, samples were thawed, disrupted by lysis (incubation at 42°C for 30 mins
followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 mins), vortexed and filtered using RNAeasy
MinElute columns (Qiagen). RNA extraction was performed using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA
Isolation Kit (Life Technologies Ltd; KIT0204) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was
quantified using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Libraries were created
by UCL Genomics Core Facility using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNAseq Kit (Clontech),
cleaned using JetSeq (Bioline) and quality control analysis of RNA integrity was performed using
High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape and the TapeStation Analysis software (Agilent Technologies).
RNA sequencing was performed using 0.5x NextSeq for 75 cycles (Illumina; 43PE, ~33M reads
per sample).
RNA sequencing analysis
Following sequencing, run data were demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ files using
Illumina’s bcl2fastq Conversion Software v2.19. Quality control and adapter trimming were
performed using fastp (Chen et al., 2018) version 0.20.1 with default settings. FASTQ files were
then tagged with the UMI read (UMITools (Smith et al., 2017)) and aligned to the human
genome UCSC hg38 using RNA-STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) version 2.5.2b. Aligned reads were
UMI deduplicated using Je-suite (Girardot et al., 2016) version 1.2.1 and count matrices were
obtained using featureCounts. Downstream analysis was performed using the R statistical
environment version 3.5.0 with Bioconductor version 3.8.0 (Huber et al., 2015). Counts were
compared between paediatric and adult groups using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) using the
default settings. Only genes with non-zero counts in at least two samples were included in
differential analysis. Pathways were assessed using an implementation of gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) in the fgsea R package (Korotkevich et al., 2019), using Hallmark gene sets from
MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2015; Subramanian et al., 2005) as input. Heatmaps were plotted using
the pheatmap (Kolde, 2012) package, implementing a complete linkage clustering method. All
other plots were created using ggplot2. To avoid confounding by sex distribution, differences

between the paediatric and adult groups, genes on the X and Y chromosomes were removed
prior to differential analysis.
Identification of gene lists
This study utilises several gene lists as included in Table S2: markers of basal, secretory and
ciliated cells, viral response genes and COVID-19 genes of interest. In each case, potentially
relevant genes were identified following expert review of the literature. For cell marker genes,
we further refine these lists following the method of Danaher and colleagues (Danaher et al.,
2017), based on the assumption that genes consistently associated with a cell type should
correlate with each other. Using normal lung RNA sequencing data from the Gene Tissue
Expression Project (GTEx Consortium, 2015), we constructed a similarity matrix for each cell
type following the Danaher method and performed hierarchical clustering. In each case, a clear
co-correlated cluster was observed (Figure S8). Genes within this cluster were taken forwards
for further analysis (Figure S8; Table S2).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of basal cells
Samples were transported to the laboratory in transport medium consisting of αMEM
containing penicillin/streptomycin, amphotericin B and gentamicin. Cell suspensions were
generated by sequential enzymatic digestion using dispase 16 U/mL (Corning) for 20 minutes
at room temperature followed by 0.1% trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) for 30 minutes at 37°C (both in
RPMI medium, Gibco). Each enzyme step was quenched with medium containing FBS, placed
on ice and combined following the second digestion. Biopsies were manually homogenized
using sharp dissection between digest steps and by blunt homogenization through a 100 μm
cell strainer (Miltenyi Biotec). Centrifugation steps were performed at 300 x g for 5 mins at
4°C. Cells were blocked in a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer composed of PBS
containing 1% FBS, 25 mM HEPES buffer and 1 mM EDTA for 20 minutes in 96-well V bottomed
plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were centrifuged as above before staining for 20
minutes on ice at 4°C. The antibodies used were CD31 (BV421; Biolegend; 303124), CD45
(BV421; Biolegend; 304031), EpCAM (APC; Biolegend; 324208), PDPN (PE-Cy7; Biolegend;
337013). Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer for sorting.

For colony formation assays, basal cells were sorted into collagen I-coated 96-well plates
containing 3T3-J2 feeder cells at 20,000 cells per cm2 using a BD FACSAria Fusion FACS sorter
running BD FACSDiva 8.0 software at the UCL Cancer Institute Flow Cytometry Core Facility.
Experiments lasted 7 days and at termination, the number of wells which had become
confluent was counted manually using a light microscope. Brightfield images were taken using
a Zeiss Axiovert A1 microscope.
For bulk RNA sequencing, basal cells were sorted into epithelial cell culture medium containing
Y-27632 for transport to the laboratory before being centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 mins at 4°C
and resuspended in RNA extraction buffer and processed as above for laser-captured samples.
Human airway epithelial cell culture
Primary human airway epithelial cells were isolated and expanded on mitotically inactivated
3T3-J2 feeder layers in two previously reported epithelial growth media, one containing Y27632 (Butler et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2012) and one without (Hynds et al., 2018; Rheinwald and
Green, 1975). Feeder layers were prepared as previously described (Hynds et al., 2019).
Epithelial cell culture medium without Y-27632 consisted of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM)/F12 in a 3:1 ratio containing 1x penicillin–streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% adenine, hydrocortisone (0.5 µg/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 µg/ml), 0.1 nM
cholera toxin, 2 x 10-5 T3 and gentamicin (10 mg/ml), as previously described (Hynds et al.,
2018). Epithelial cell culture medium containing Y-27632 consisted of DMEM/F12 in a 3:1 ratio
containing 1x penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco), 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) supplemented
with 5 μM Y-27632 (Cambridge Bioscience), hydrocortisone (25 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich),
epidermal growth factor (0.125 ng/ml; Sino Biological), insulin (5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 nM
cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), amphotericin B (250 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
gentamicin (10 μg/ml; Gibco), as previously described (Butler et al., 2016). Where indicated,
dishes were collagen I-coated by diluting rat tail collagen I (BD Biosciences) to 50 μg/ml in
sterile 0.02N acetic acid and applying at 5 μg/cm2 for one hour at room temperature in a tissue
culture hood. Coated surfaces were washed once with sterile PBS before cell seeding.
Population doublings were calculated as previously described (Butler et al., 2016).
RNA sequencing of cultured basal cells was performed after either two or three passages in

epithelial cell culture medium containing Y-27632. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was submitted for library
preparation by the Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute. Initial QC was performed
using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and TapeStation Analysis software
(Agilent Technologies). 600 ng RNA was used for library preparation using the NEBNext
Ultra8482 II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and the QIAseq FastSelect RNA Removal
Kit (Qiagen). Libraries were subsequently measured using the Qubit system and visualized on
a TapeStation D5000. Sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq6000 SP PE50 Standard
(~58M Illumina reads per sample) at the CRUK-CI Genomics Core. Following quality control and
adapter trimming with fastp (as described above), paired-end reads were aligned to the human
genome UCSC hg38 using RNA-STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) version 2.5.2b. Count matrices were
obtained using featureCounts. Downstream analysis was performed as described for epithelial
and basal RNAseq datasets above.
Proliferation assays
For MTT assays, primary human airway epithelial cells that had been isolated and expanded in
epithelial cell culture medium without Y-27632 were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
5,000 cells/well for 24 hours without feeder cells. At the stated end-points, adherent cells were
stained with MTT dye solution (10 µl of 1:10 diluted MTT stock solution in culture medium) for
3 hours at 37°C. After incubation, the medium was removed and 100 µl dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to dissolve the MTT crystals. The eluted specific stain was
measured using a spectrophotometer (560 nm).
To analyse EdU uptake, passage 1 primary human airway epithelial cells that had been isolated
and expanded in epithelial cell culture medium without Y-27632 were cultured until
approximately 70% confluence. Cells were washed with PBS and feeder cells were removed by
differential trypsinization. After washing in DMEM containing 10% FBS and then PBS again, the
remaining epithelial cells were treated with 10 μM EdU (Life Technologies Click-iT EdU Alexa
Fluor 488) for 1 hour. Cells were trypsinized to obtain single cell suspensions, stained according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and finally co-stained with DAPI. Cells were run on an
LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and data were analysed using FlowJo 10.0.6
(TreeStar).

Colony formation assays
2,000 cultured human airway epithelial cells were seeded per well of a collagen I-coated sixwell plate containing inactivated 3T3-J2 feeder cells. Medium was carefully changed on day 4
and day 8 of culture before the experiment was terminated on day 12. Colonies were fixed for
10 minutes in 4% PFA, stained using crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 20
minutes and washed repeatedly in water. Colonies of more than 10 cells were counted
manually using a light microscope. Colony forming efficiency was calculated as: (number of
colonies formed/number of seeded cells) * 100.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were cultured in 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi) and fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes at room
temperature. Slides were washed and stored in PBS until staining. Cells were permeabilized
and blocked in PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.025% Triton X for 1 hour at room temperature.
Primary anti-Ki67 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, RM-9106) was incubated overnight in
block buffer without Triton X at 4°C. After three 5-minute washes in PBS, anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies (AlexaFluor dyes; Molecular Probes) were incubated at a 1:200 dilution in block
buffer without Triton X for 2 hours at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS, counterstained using DAPI (1 μg/ml stock, 1:10,000 in PBS) and washed twice more in PBS. Images
were acquired using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.
Ki67 staining was performed by seeding passage 1 cells on feeder cells for 3 days. Feeder cells
were removed by differential trypsinization and basal cells were fixed in 4% PFA prior to
staining as above. Ki67 positivity was assessed by manual counting of Ki67-stained nuclei as a
proportion of all DAPI-stained nuclei in five images per donor (mean = 1402 cells per donor,
range 810 – 1600).
GFP and mCherry lentiviral production
One Shot Stbl3 chemically competent E. coli bacteria (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
transformed using third generation lentiviral plasmids. The GFP-containing and mCherrycontaining plasmids were pCDH-EF1-copGFP-T2A-Puro and pCDH-CMV-mCherry-T2A-Puro
(gifts from Kazuhiro Oka; Addgene plasmids #72263 and #72264). The packaging plasmids used

plates overnight, and colonies expanded from this in LB broth containing ampicillin. Plasmids
were extracted using the PureLinkTM HiPure Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with the PureLinkTM HiPure Precipitator module (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid DNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop
system.
293T Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1x
penicillin/streptomycin were used to assemble and produce the viruses. Packaging and
transfer plasmids were delivered into 293T cells by transfection with jetPEI (Polyplus; 101-01N)
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Medium was changed at 4 hours and 24 hours posttransfection. Culture medium containing the shed virus was collected at 72 hours and
incubated with PEG-it virus precipitation solution (System Biosciences) at 4°C for 48 hours. The
precipitated virus was extracted following centrifugation of the mixture as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Viral stock titre was determined by incubating 293T HEK cells (50,000 cells/well) in 12- well
plates at 1:100, 1:1000, 1:10,000 and 1:100,000 viral dilutions in complete DMEM medium
containing 4 μg/mL polybrene for 4 hours before medium was refreshed. After 72 hours, cells
were trypsinized, DAPI stained and GFP or mCherry positivity was determined by flow
cytometry. Viral titre was calculated as:
Viral titre (particles/ml) = (% positive cells) x 50,000 / Volume of virus added (ml)
Competitive growth assay optimization in 293T HEK cells
293T HEK cells were transduced for 24 hours with either mCherry (multiplicity of infection
(MOIs) of 0.15 or 0.75) or GFP viruses (MOIs of 0.05 or 0.5). Following incubation for 72 hours,
cells were sorted by FACS into high- or low-expressing populations and expanded further.
Population doubling times were calculated for each colour and MOI, and these values were
compared to untransduced cells. Cells were then seeded as a 1:1 mix of GFP- and mCherryexpressing cells into quadruplicate wells of a 48-well plate (10,000 of each colour at either high

or low expression). These cells were passaged twice per week. At each passage, the contents
of each well were trypsinized and the percentage of GFP and mCherry-expressing cells was
analysed by flow cytometry. 80% of each well’s cell volume was immediately re-plated into
fresh 48-well plates whilst 20% of the sample from each well was stained with a live/dead
fixable stain, fixed with 4% PFA and analysed for GFP and mCherry expression by flow
cytometry. Reference wells containing 10,000 cells of a single colour were trypsinized at the
same time points and counted manually to calculate a doubling time for each cell type.
Lentiviral transduction of cultured human basal cells
Primary human tracheobronchial basal cells were isolated and expanded in epithelial cell
culture medium containing Y-27632 for two passages before transduction with either GFP- or
mCherry-containing viruses (MOI = 100). Transduction was performed in culture medium plus
4 μg/mL polybrene and medium was exchanged for fresh culture medium after 16 hours.
Purification of cultures to remove untransduced cells was performed by FACS for GFP or
mCherry positivity after 7-10 days of further expansion. Since both the GFP and mCherry
lentiviral plasmids carry a puromycin resistance cassette, PCR copy number analysis for the
puromycin cassette was performed to quantify the number of lentiviral copies incorporated
per donor cell (Taqman custom copy number assay). Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from
each transduced cell culture using a blood & cell culture DNA mini kit (Qiagen) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. gDNA was quantified using a NanoDrop system and PCR
performed using the TaqMan genotyping master mix and reference assay (Life Technologies).
Stable transduction was confirmed by flow cytometry prior to competitive proliferation assays.
Human airway basal cell competitive proliferation assays
Feeder cells were removed from cultures of GFP+ and mCherry+ basal cells by differential
trypsinization and basal cells were suspended in FACS buffer containing 5 μM Y-27632 for
FACS. Cells were seeded by FACS as a 1:1 mix of GFP- and mCherry-expressing cells into
triplicate wells of a 24-well plate containing 3T3-J2 feeder cells (5000 or 10,000 of each colour).
All paediatric cultures were crossed with all of the adult cultures of the opposite label. Medium
was refreshed after three and five days. At seven days or at 80-90% confluence as ascertained
by fluorescence microscopy, the entire contents of the well were trypsinized for flow
cytometry (i.e. feeder cells were not removed). The resulting cell suspensions were digested

enzymatically with 0.25 U / mL liberase (thermolysin medium; Roche) in serum-free medium
to form a single cell suspension, which was quenched with medium containing 10% FBS.
Zombie Violet Live/Dead fixable stain was applied as per the manufacturer’s instructions and
cell suspensions were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 mins at room temperature. GFP and mCherry
expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Feeder cells were seen as an unlabelled
population. Untransduced paediatric cells cultured in parallel were used as non-labelled
controls and single colour wells containing 10,000 cells from each individual donor were used
as single colour controls.
Cell growth advantages were calculated using the growth calculation of Eekels et al. for two
cell populations, assuming exponential change in the ratio of the two populations over time
(Eekels et al., 2012). To calculate the growth advantage of paediatric cells over adult cells, we
used the formula:
Ga = Td(adult) x log2(y) / (x + Td(adult) x log2(y)) x 100%
Where Ga is the calculated growth advantage, Td(adult) is the doubling time in days of the adult
donor cell culture, x is the number of days of the experiment and y is equal to % paediatric
cells / % adult cells at the time point x divided by the % paediatric cells / % adult cells at the
time point 0. Td(adult) values were calculated from population doubling curves for each
individual donor in independent, single donor cultures under the same cell culture
conditions. The experiment was performed in technical triplicate and for each donor pair we
calculated values for both GFP (paediatric) / mCherry (adult) and mCherry (paediatric) / GFP
(adult) crosses to rule out differential effects on proliferation from the two lentiviruses.

Supplementary Data

Figure S1: Laser-capture microdissection of whole tracheobronchial epithelium from fresh
frozen paediatric and adult donor tissue.
(A) A slide was haematoxylin & eosin stained at the start of sectioning as a guide for

identification of the epithelium. The approximate area identified in (B)-(E) is indicated by a
black box. Scale bar = 500 μm. (B) The equivalent area of epithelium was identified (scale bar
= 150 μm) and (C) captured using the ‘freehand’ tool (Zeiss RoboSoftware; green line; scale bar
= 150 μm). Care was taken to cut immediately below the basement membrane. (D) The laser
cut around this outline to release the tissue (scale bar = 150 μm). (E) If samples did not
immediately lift onto the adhesive surface of the collection tube cap, the ‘dot’ tool was used
to capture the tissue (Zeiss RoboSoftware; scale bar = 150 μm).

Figure S3: Validation of competitive proliferation assay approach using 293T human embryonic
kidney (HEK) cells.
(A) Following lentiviral transduction at two different multiplicities of infection (MOI), 293T HEK

cells were FACS-sorted to generate pure cell populations of either GFP+ or mCherry+ cells.
Immunofluorescence imaging showed that the fluorescence intensity was higher after
transductions at the higher MOI. Cells were imaged 24 hours after sorting. Cells remained
stably transduced even after transduction using the lower MOI. Scale bars = 200 μm. (B)
Fluorescence imaging of mixed cultures of GFP+ and mCherry+ 293T HEK cells after 5 days.
Scale bars = 200 μm. (C) Flow cytometry analysis of the ratio of mCherry+ and GFP+ cells in
mixed cultures of transduced 293T HEK cells. Cells were initially combined in a 1:1 ratio and
analysed at the time points indicated. The cells remained close to a 1:1 ratio over two weeks
of culture. (D) Population doubling analysis of the growth of GFP- and mCherry-expressing
293T HEK cells.

Figure S4: Validation of competitive growth assay approach in primary human proximal airway
basal cells.
(A) Immunofluorescence imaging 7 days post-transduction of human basal cells with GFP

(above) and mCherry (below) lentiviral constructs. (B) Immunofluorescence imaging 10 days
after fluorescence-activated cell sorting to purify GFP+ (above) and mCherry+ (below)
populations from untransduced cells. (C) Immunofluorescence imaging of cultures 4 days after
mixing of primary human airway basal cells in a 1:1 ratio. (D) Flow cytometry experiment in
which GFP+ and mCherry+ cells from the same donor were mixed in equal ratio and analysed
after 7 days. (E) Copy number determination for the puromycin resistance gene, which is
present in both the GFP- and mCherry-containing lentiviruses. There were no differences in
viral integration between either paediatric and adult cell cultures or between GFP and mCherry
lentiviruses (p = 0.79 for GFP, p = 0.53 for mCherry, two-tailed unpaired t-test).

Figure S6: Expression of viral infection-associated epithelial cell genes in paediatric and adult
FACS-sorted, non-cultured proximal airway basal cells.
(A) Cluster diagram showing the expression of 49 genes related to viral infection of epithelial

cells in the three paediatric and three adult FACS-sorted EpCAM+/PDPN+ basal cell samples.
Gene order is based on hierarchical clustering based on the similarity in overall expression
patterns. Red represents relative expression higher than the median expression and blue
represents lower expression. Genes that are not expressed in this dataset are excluded (see
Table S2). (B) Plots comparing the expression (log normalized counts) of selected host genes
associated with SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL), other coronavirus (ADAM17, ANPEP,
DPP4) and influenza (ST6GAL1, ST3GAL4, TMPRSS4) infection in the three paediatric and three
adult FACS-sorted EpCAM+/PDPN+ basal cell samples. All genes analysed were non-significant
(FDR > 0.05) when comparing paediatric and adult samples using a Wilcoxon test with
correction for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Figure S8: Refining tracheobronchial cell type-specific gene lists by co-correlation.
(A) A similarity matrix, based on the method of Danaher et al. (Danaher et al., 2017), showing

co-correlation of the expression of a manually curated list of genes expected to be expressed
by airway basal cells (see Table S2) in the Gene Tissue Expression Project normal lung RNA
sequencing data (GTEx Consortium, 2015). Hierarchical clustering revealed a sub-cluster of
genes whose expression was correlated. These were taken forward for further analyses as cell
type-specific gene signatures and applied to our proximal airway epithelial cell RNA sequencing
datasets. (B) As for (A) but using a manually curated list of genes expected to be expressed by
airway mucosecretory cells. (C) As for (A) and (B) but using a manually curated list of genes
expected to be expressed by airway ciliated cells.
