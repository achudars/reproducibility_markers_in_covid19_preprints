Abstract

21

We conducted two studies of water samples from buildings with normal occupancy and water usage compared to

22

water from buildings that were unoccupied with little or no water usage due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Study 1

23

had 52 water samples obtained ad hoc from buildings in four metropolitan locations in different states in the US and

24

a range of building types. Study 2 had 36 water samples obtained from two buildings in one metropolitan location

25

with matched water sample types. One of the buildings had been continuously occupied, and the other substantially

26

vacant for approximately 3 months. All water samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with a

27

MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. More than 127 genera of bacteria were identified, including genera

28

with members that are known to include more than 50 putative frank and opportunistic pathogens. While specific

29

results varied among sample locations, 16S rRNA amplicon abundance and the diversity of bacteria were higher in

30

water samples from unoccupied buildings than normally occupied buildings as was the abundance of sequenced

31

amplicons of genera known to include pathogenic bacterial members. In both studies Legionella amplicon

32

abundance was relatively small compared to the abundance of the other bacteria in the samples. Indeed, when

33

present, the relative abundance of Legionella amplicons was lower in samples from unoccupied buildings.

34

Legionella did not predominate in any of the water samples and were found, on average, in 9.6% of samples in

35

Study 1 and 8.3% of samples in Study 2.

Introduction

41

Stagnation of water in building plumbing systems can result in deterioration of water quality and proliferation of

42

pathogens causing a major public health concern 1. Stagnation can also result in low or undetectable levels of

43

residual disinfectant, such as chlorine 2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has experienced

44

building shutdowns on a scale and duration not previously experienced. This disuse may present a risk to public

45

health from pathogenic microbes that can grow in building plumbing systems

46

guidance documents address the potential adverse effect on the quality of water that has stagnated in premise

2,3

. Numerous recently-issued

47

plumbing systems due to reduced occupancy during the current COVID-19 pandemic

48

centers on Legionella, a plumbing-associated waterborne pathogen.

2,4–6

. Much of this guidance

49
50

Legionella are found throughout the natural aquatic environment 7. Legionella growth in premise plumbing systems

51

is supported by certain physical-chemical conditions that are associated with stagnant water: accumulated sediment,

52

tepid temperatures, excessive water age and absence of residual disinfectant. Many of the recent guidance

53

documents addressing re-occupancy of buildings after COVID-related closures regard Legionella as the

54

predominant, if not the only pathogen of concern in stagnant water in under-occupied buildings; some assume that

55

significant Legionella contamination is probable if not inevitable, and some suggest that testing only for Legionella

56

is sufficient to determine whether or not a building is safe to re-occupy. Implementation of the recommendations in

57

these guidance documents has important financial and public health implications. At the most fundamental level, we

58

believe that the rationale for focusing on Legionella merits evidence-based scrutiny. One approach to this scrutiny is

59

to characterize the microbial community structures of potable water from building plumbing systems, in order to

60

identify bacterial genera with at least some members that are known to be pathogenic.

61
62

Marker gene amplicon sequencing is commonly used to assess microbial communities and has a nearly 40-year

63

history 8. Molecular methods have distinct advantages over culturing and isolation; the routine isolation of all

64

pathogens from water samples is impractical and cannot accurately characterize the microbial diversity in natural

65

environments

66

on metagenomic analyses of potable water systems 11. The 16S rRNA gene is a suitable choice for characterizing

67

microbial community structures

68

the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinIONTM, can provide rapid and cost effective results.

9,10

. Interestingly, despite public health relevance of potable water, very little information is available

8

and when combined with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as

69
70

The use of amplicon sequencing to assess microbial community composition and diversity is limited to identification

71

at the genus level. In contrast to qPCR, amplicon sequencing does not broadly provide resolution to the species

72

level. Rather, it provides a powerful means of initial screening for genera known to have at least some pathogenic

73

members and can help elucidate the changes in and differences between microbial communities in potable water

74

from different sources, such as occupied vs. unoccupied buildings. Studies like this one using 16S rRNA gene

75

sequencing of potable water can provide useful and important insights that provide evidence-based observations to

76

inform further, targeted testing necessary for the safe reopening of buildings after prolonged unoccupancy.

77
78

In this report we present the results of two studies (Study 1 and Study 2) of microbial communities in water from

79

buildings with normal occupancy and water usage compared to water from buildings that were unoccupied with

80

little or no water usage due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Study 1 had 52 water samples obtained from buildings in

81

four metropolitan locations in different states in the US and a range of building types. Study 2 had 36 water samples

82

obtained from two buildings in one metropolitan location with matched water sample types. All water samples were

83

analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

84
85

Experimental Methods

86

For Studies 1 and 2 we collected a total of 88 1-liter water samples for analysis and comparison. Samples were taken

87

from (a) buildings with low or no occupancy (“unoccupied”) for which flushing had not been implemented and (b)

88

buildings with normal, uninterrupted occupancy (“occupied”).

89
90

For Study 1 we collected water samples from 52 buildings across 4 states— Michigan, Nevada, New York and

91

Texas. Types of buildings sampled included residential condominiums, office buildings, hotels and dormitories. 1-L

92

bulk water samples were collected from multiple locations in each building sampled. The number of samples and

93

sample type—e.g., hot water or cold water, proximal or distal—varied from building to building.

94
95

For Study 2 we collected 36 water samples from two closely situated, very similar dormitory buildings on a college

96

campus; one was occupied and the other unoccupied. Water sampling locations from the two buildings were similar;

97

samples were taken from the main water supply trunks, hot water supply, and from locations distributed spatially

98

throughout the buildings. The number, type and location of samples were matched as closely as possible.

99
100

Samples were shipped overnight in coolers to help maintain stable temperature. Sample processing, initiated within

101

24 hours of receipt, was as follows:

103

Samples were concentrated through a membrane ultrafilter (Filpath™ Ultrafilter, Nephros, Inc., South Orange,

104

NJ, USA)

105

•

Lysis

106

Sample concentrate remaining on the filter was treated with a lysis buffer solution (Environmental Lysis

107

Solution, Chai, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and then removed.

108

•

Amplification

109

Lysate samples were added directly to PCR reaction mixes for amplifying the 16S rRNA genes. Amplification

110

of 16S rRNA genes was conducted using the 16S Barcoding Kit (SQK-RAB204; Oxford Nanopore

111

Technologies, Oxford, UK) containing the 27F/1492R primer set, LongAmpTM Taq 2x Master Mix (New

112

England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and Chai Green Dye 20x (Chai, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).

113

Amplification was performed using a Chai Open™ qPCR thermal cycler (Chai, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA)

114

with the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 53°C for

115

30 s, and 65°C for 2 min.

116

•

Library preparation

117

PCR products were purified using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA), two 70% alcohol

118

washes, and quantified by a NanoDrop (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA). Purified amplicons were pooled (up

119

to 12) and a total of 100 ng DNA was used for library preparation.

120

•

Amplicon sequencing

121

MinIONTM sequencing was performed using R9.4 flow cells (FLO-MIN106; Oxford Nanopore Technologies)

122

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MINKNOW software ver. 19.12.5 (Oxford Nanopore

123

Technologies) was used for data acquisition.

124

•

Bioinformatic analysis

125

The EPI2METM platform 16S Workflow (Metrichor, Ltd., a subsidiary of Oxford Nanopore Technology) was

126

used to classify sequencing reads and perform bacterial genera identification.

127

•

Estimates of bacterial concentrations

128

Estimates of bacterial concentrations (as CFU/mL) were based on Cq values for each 1-liter water sample by (a)

129

estimating the starting 16S rRNA target DNA copies present in the PCR reaction volume, and then performing a

130

series of back-calculations estimating the number of CFU per milliliter of bacteria present in each of the 1-liter

131

samples of water concentrated on the filters, assuming one copy of the template target per cell.

132
133

Results and Discussion

134

Table 1 and 2 provide water sample information collected for Study 1 and 2, respectively. The measured DNA

135

concentration (Study 1 only) was measured using the lysate (post- filter concentration and lysis) using a Thermo-

136

Fisher NanoDropTM 1000. This DNA concentration is all-source (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) in contrast to the 16S

137

rRNA gene sequence abundance which is representative of bacterial DNA presence in the samples.

Bacterial proliferation in stagnant water of unoccupied buildings

144

In Study 1 we generated a total of 1,765,493 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences from the 52 water samples. The

145

average amplicon abundance of unoccupied building samples was more than twice that of samples from occupied

146

buildings, with the ratio of 16S rRNA gene amplicon abundance (unoccupied:occupied) ranging 1.5:1 to more than

147

1400:1. The microbial communities, as indicated by bacterial genera, in unoccupied building samples appear to be

148

more diverse—i.e., 82% more bacterial genera are present. Both unoccupied and occupied samples contain multiple

149

bacterial genera; 10-80% of the identified bacteria genera are putative potential human pathogens, based on the

150

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list of Opportunistic Pathogens of Premise Plumbing

151

amplicon sequence abundance of pathogenic bacteria appears to be generally higher in unoccupied samples, but the

152

percentage proportion of amplicon sequence of pathogenic bacteria appears to be generally lower. In Study 2 we

153

generated a total of 322,601 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences form the 36 water samples. The average amplicon

154

abundance of unoccupied building samples was almost 1.5 times that of occupied samples, with the ratio of 16S

155

rRNA gene amplicon abundance (unoccupied:occupied) 6:1. Overall the combined 88 samples yield a ratio of

156

amplicon abundance of 1.6:1 and an average amplicon abundance ratio of 1.4:1 (see Table 3).

In both studies we used an intercalating dye in the PCR reaction when amplifying the 16S rRNA gene target and

161

were only able to obtain a Cq value for 14 of the 52 samples in Study 1and 7 of the 36 samples in Study 2. For the

162

14 samples in Study 2 with a Cq value we calculated an estimate of the total bacterial bioburden, or the CFU/ml

163

inclusive of all bacteria in the samples. The calculated CFU/ml values ranged from approximately 8 to

164

approximately 2,000 CFU/ml. The average CFU/ml estimate for unoccupied building water samples in Study 1 was

165

approximately 6 times higher than the average CFU/ml for occupied samples. From the 7 Cq values obtained in

166

Study 2 the calculated CFU/ml values ranged from approximately 8 to approximately 1,280 CFU/ml. The number of

167

occupied vs unoccupied samples with Cq values was not sufficient for a comparison. For those samples that did not

168

yield a Cq value, we can only conclude that the bioburden was less than 2 CFU/ml in each of those samples.

Bacterial pathogen proliferation in stagnant water of unoccupied buildings

171

For simplicity, in both Studies 1 and 2, only the 12 most abundant bacterial genera in each sample were considered

172

for further analysis and comparison. The cutoff of 12 was arbitrarily chosen.

174

The total abundance of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences of in Study 2 for the 12 most abundant bacterial genera

175

was 7,411. Table 4 shows the comparison of gene amplicon sequence proportions for pathogenic genera and

176

nonpathogenic genera in occupied and unoccupied building samples.

The shift observed here of relative dominate proportion from occupied to unoccupied between pathogen and

182

nonpathogen is similarly seem in Study 1. While pathogens seem to predominate in proportion in occupied building

183

water samples when compared to nonpathogen genera, this is inverted in unoccupied building water samples. This

184

phenomenon would seem to indicate a complex microbial community dynamic that merits further examination.

185

Additionally, the proportions of specific bacterial genera gene amplicon sequences show changes or shifts between

186

occupied and unoccupied building water samples (see Figure 1) also indicative of a dynamic microbial community

187

composition.

Figure 2: Percent abundance of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence for 5 samples from Study 1 (4 unoccupied

203

water samples; 1 occupied water sample) which contained Legionella.

204
205

In Study 2, 3 samples contained Legionella at an exceedingly low level except one. A single occupied building

206

water sample in Study 2 was taken from a currently unoccupied single living space that had a slow, constant leaking

207

fixture (a kitchen sink faucet). This sample was removed from the further combined analyses for reasons given

208

below but, presents a special case and deserves additional consideration. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of

209

this sample resulted in the largest total number of reads for a single sample in the study (153,532; almost 50% of the

210

grand total study-wide), and the second largest number of reads in the 12 most abundant genera selected for further

211

analysis (81,513). This single sample accounted for almost 80,000 total putative pathogen sequenced amplicon, 320

212

of which were identified as Legionella (the largest abundance of Legionella of any sample in the Study by a factor

213

of more than 100), and 2,333 nonpathogen reads.

214
215

Conclusions

216

The results of these studies should be considered in light of the caveats mentioned previously and with consideration

217

of the limitations described below. Notwithstanding the caveats and limitations, we believe the results have

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.209346; this version posted August 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

218

immediate practical implications with respect to the planning for re-occupancy of buildings following low

219

occupancy due to COVID-19 measures (where water has stagnated in the pipes). Conventional wisdom and the

220

scientific literature indicate that when potable water is allowed to dwell in building plumbing for a long period of

221

time that stagnation will occur, and microorganisms will proliferate. It is likely that buildings that have been vacant

222

or experienced low occupancy due to the recent or ongoing shutdowns will have greater levels of bacteria (including

223

potential human pathogens) than expected under normal occupancy. Given the results presented in these studies

224

water safety managers should not assume the water is contaminated with Legionella but rather that it likely harbors

225

other pathogenic bacteria which present a public health hazard if exposed to or consumed by humans. Water testing

226

only for Legionella is therefore insufficient and may provide false security against other significant health threats. If

227

water samples are tested, they should be screened for multiple genera using technology similar to those described in

228

these studies or equivalent, then tested for specific pathogens of concern based as indicated by the initial screen.

229
230

The results of these studies also underscore the complexity of microbial community dynamics that are resident in

231

building premise plumbing systems. The sample taken in Study 2 from the leaky kitchen faucet also remind us that

232

local effects – a constant, slow flow of nutrient with insufficient force to dislodge biofilms – can drastically impact

233

the microbial community and ecosystem locally and lead to a potentially disastrous situation for someone

234

consuming the water and variety of microbe. There are many questions yet to be addressed and answered utilizing

235

evidence-based observations aided by current technologies.

236
237

Study Limitations

238

o

The buildings in Study 1 were not graded by degree of water usage or length of reduced occupancy; in some

239

cases, these details are not known. Assigned categories were binary—unoccupied vs. occupied—and did not

240

always consider potentially significant differences in building type, usage patterns, quality/variability in the

241

water supply to the building, or other factors that could have a profound effect on test results.

242

o

Sample analysis was not performed in triplicate.

243

o

The precision of estimates of bacterial concentration (as CFU/mL) based on qPCR is inherently limited.

244

Comparisons made of estimated bacterial populations in stagnant vs. non-stagnant samples should be considered

245

qualitative. Estimates of bacterial concentrations were made for only 14 of the 52 samples.

246

o

Classification of the microbial community structure based on comparing targeted sequencing data to databases

247

of 16S rRNA can yield bacterial identity to the level of genera—i.e, operation taxonomic units (OTU) or

248

amplicon sequence variants (ASV)—but may not be sufficiently reliable in all cases for identification at the

249

species level.

250

o

251

Comparisons between marker gene amplified sequence reads can be biased and confounded, particularly when
attempting to draw conclusions regarding environmental or ecological effects.
