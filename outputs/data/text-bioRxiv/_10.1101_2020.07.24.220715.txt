ABSTRACT

19

The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and its causative

20

agent, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions, globally. The highly contagious nature of this

21

respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In

22

addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a

23

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit

24

vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in

25

combination with either CoVaccine HTTM or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HTTM induced high titres of

26

antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a

27

greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus

neutralising antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine

29

HTTM can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction

32

The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Coronavirus

33

Disease 2019 (COVID-19), began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and quickly spread across the

34

globe causing epidemics on every continent except Antarctica in under four months. This virus

35

has caused more than 15.5 million cases and over 630,000 deaths worldwide (as of 7-24-20) 1.

36

SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible during both the pre-symptomatic and acute symptomatic

37

phases and the infection fatality rate has been reported as high as 3.4% 2. COVID-19 often

38

develops into severe illness, including pneumonia. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or

39

effective therapeutic strategies available to treat COVID-19. Evidence indicates that high titres

40

of antibody targeting the Spike protein may neutralise virus, a concept which carries credence for

41

the closely related SARS-CoV 3-5. Vaccine platforms at the forefront of development are mRNA-

42

based, DNA-based, virally vectored (replication competent or incompetent), as well as

43

recombinant protein subunits 6,7. Many vaccine candidates may require adjuvantation to induce

44

robust immune responses and rapidly induce high antibody titres. However, no consensus is

45

established on an optimal adjuvant that best induces protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

46
47

In order to investigate which adjuvants induce a strong humoral response, our group has

48

formulated protein subunit vaccine candidates using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike

49

subdomain 1 (S1) protein, obtained from Sino Biological, Inc., adjuvanted with either CoVaccine

50

HTTM or Alhydrogel. The former is a proprietary adjuvant and the latter is an FDA approved

51

adjuvant used in several FDA licensed vaccines. CoVaccine HTTM is an oil-in-water emulsion of

52

hydrophobic, negatively-charged sucrose fatty acid sulphate esters with the addition of

53

squalane8,9 whereas Alhydrogel is a colloid of aluminium hydroxide which binds protein to

54

facilitate antigen recognition and thus, improve the immune response 10. The mechanism of

55

action of Alhydrogel remains somewhat elusive, however this adjuvant likely interacts with

56

NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) but does not interact with TLRs11. This difference in

57

cellular activation can account for the disparities seen between the use of CoVaccine HTTM and

58

Alhydrogel presented here. The stabilised oil in water emulsion functions by generating a

59

response skewed towards a T-helper type 1 cell (Th1) direction which can in turn sustain CD8 T

60

cells capable of mitigating viral infection12. This adjuvant is also capable of inducing T cell

61

differentiation to T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells which is evident through immunoglobulin class

62

switching to IgG2a13. In concert, these cellular responses enhance the humoral response

63

evidenced by the overall higher titres of IgG13.

64
65

CoVaccine HTTM also offers an advantage in comparison to Alhydrogel regarding particle size.

66

Alhydrogel particles typically fall within the range of 1-10 microns14 whereas CoVaccine HTTM

67

is typically showing droplet sizes around 130 nm15,16. Smaller particle sizes offer increased

68

stability and enhanced adjuvanticity and in comparison, particle sizes of other commercial stable

69

oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants (MF59 and AS03) are in the range of 160nm17. These oil-in-

70

water emulsion adjuvants utilize squalene, a shark fat derived product 9,18,19. The use of squalane

71

in CoVaccine HTTM as a plant-derived product may be advantageous due to availability, reduced

72

regulatory burden, and potentially also ideologically to the population being immunised. In

73

summary, CoVaccine HTTM could provide a distinct advantage over Alhydrogel as the more

74

conventional adjuvant choice.

75
76

Here we tested the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 proteins adjuvanted with either

77

CoVaccine HT™, Alhydrogel, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in BALB/c mice. We assessed

78

overall antibody titres, immunoglobulin subclass diversity, cell mediated immunity, and in-vitro

79

neutralisation of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We demonstrate that CoVaccine HT™ elicits

80

rapid humoral responses, increased subclass diversity, more interferon gamma (INFγ)

81

production, and higher neutralising antibody titres than the other adjuvants. Collectively,

82

CoVaccine HT™ may be advantageous over other adjuvants for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

83
84

2. Methods

85

2.1 Vaccination and Serum Collection

86

BALB/c mice (7-8 weeks of age, male and female) were immunised twice, three weeks apart,

87

intramuscularly (IM) with 5 µg of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 (Sino Biological 40592-V05H)

88

protein with or without adjuvants, or adjuvant alone, using an insulin syringe with a 29-gauge

89

needle. The adjuvants used were CoVaccine HT™ (Protherics Medicines Development Ltd,

90

London, United Kingdom), or 2% Alhydrogel adjuvant (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Sera were

91

collected by tail bleeding at 2 weeks post-immunisation or cardiac puncture for terminal bleeds.

92

An additional serum sample was collected by cardiac puncture at day 28 along with splenocytes

93

from three animals in the Spike S1 + CoVaccine HT™ (S1+CoVac) and S1 + Alum groups, and

94

two animals in the S1+PBS group.

2.2 Serological Immunoglobulin Assays

97

Internally dyed, carboxylated, magnetic microspheres (Mag-PlexTM-C) were obtained from

98

Luminex Corporation (Austin, TX, USA). The coupling of individually addressable

99

microspheres with all previously mentioned proteins were conducted as described previously20,21.

100

Microspheres dyed with spectrally different fluorophores were also coupled with bovine serum

101

albumin as a negative control. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV specific

102

immunoglobulin antibody titres in mouse sera were measured using a microsphere immunoassay

103

as previously described with some minor alterations13,22,23. Briefly, microspheres coupled to his-

104

tagged Spike S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV (Sino Biological 40591-

105

V08H, 40150-V08B1, & 40069-V08H, respectively), and control beads coupled to bovine serum

106

albumin (BSA) were combined and diluted in MIA buffer (PBS-1% BSA-0.02%Tween20) at a

107

dilution of 1/200. Multiplex beads (at 50 μL containing approximately 1,250 beads of each type)

108

were added to each well of black-sided 96-well plates. 50 μL of diluted serum were added to the

109

microspheres in duplicate and incubated for 3 hours on a plate shaker set at 700 rpm in the dark

110

at 37°C. The plates were then washed twice with 200 μL of MIA buffer using a magnetic plate

111

separator (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). 50 μL of red-phycoerythrin (R-PE) conjugated

112

F(ab’)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG specific to the Fc fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch,

113

Inc., West Grove, PA) were added at 1 µg/ml to the wells and incubated for 45 minutes. Antigen-

114

specific IgG subclass titres were determined using mouse antisera at a 1:1000 dilution. Detection

115

antibodies were subclass specific goat anti-mouse polyclonal R-PE-conjugated antibodies

116

(Southern Biotech) used at a 1:200 dilution. The plates were washed twice, as described above,

117

and microspheres were then resuspended in 120 µl of drive fluid (MilliporeSigma) and analysed

118

on the MAGPIX Instrument (MilliporeSigma). Data acquisition detecting the median

119

fluorescence intensity (MFI) was set to 50 beads per spectral region. Antigen-coupled beads

120

were recognized and quantified based on their spectral signature and signal intensity,

121

respectively. Assay cut-off values were calculated first by taking the mean of technical duplicate

122

values using the average MFI (indicated as a dashed black line) from the adjuvant only control

123

group. Cut-offs were generated by determining the mean MFI values plus three standard

124

deviations as determined by Microsoft Office Excel program. Graphical representation of the

125

data was done using Prism, Graphpad Software (San Diego, CA).

126
127

2.3 Plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT)

128

A PRNT was performed in a biosafety level 3 facility (at BIOQUAL, Inc.) using 24-well plates.

129

Mouse sera pooled from individual mice within each group, were diluted to 1:10, and a 1:3 serial

130

dilution series was performed 11 times. Diluted samples were then incubated with 30 plaque-

131

forming units of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, BEI Resources NR-52281) in an

132

equal volume of culture media (DMEM-10% FBS with gentamicin) for 1hr at 37°C . The serum-

133

virus mixtures were added to a monolayer of confluent Vero E6 cells and incubated for 1 hour at

134

37°C in 5% CO2. Each well was then overlaid with 1mL of culture media containing 0.5%

135

methylcellulose and incubated for 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2. The plates were then fixed with

136

methanol at -20°C for 30 minutes and stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 30 minutes at room

137

temperature. Neutralisation titres were defined as the highest serum dilution that resulted in 50%

138

(PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction in the number of plaques.

2.4 Preparation of mouse splenocytes and FluoroSpot assay

141

Mouse spleens were harvested at day 7 after the second dose, minced, passed through a cell

142

strainer, and cryopreserved after lysis of red blood cells. Cellular immune responses were

143

measured by IFN-γ FluoroSpot assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cat. No. FSP-

144

4246-2 Mabtech, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Briefly, splenocytes were rested at 37°C, in 5 % CO2 for

145

3 hours after thawing to allow removal of cell debris. A total of 2.5 x 105 cells per well in serum-

146

free CTL-TestTM medium (Cellular Technology Limited, Shaker Heights, OH) were added to a

147

96 well PVDF membrane plate pre-coated with capture monoclonal antibodies and stimulated for

148

40 hours with peptides, PepTivator® SARS-CoV-2 Prot_S1 peptide pool consisting of 15-mer

149

peptides with 11 amino acids overlapping, covering the N-terminal S1 domain of the Spike

150

protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) at 0.2 g/mL and 0.5 g/mL per

151

peptide, or medium alone. Splenocytes at (5 x 104 per well) were incubated with PMA (0.01 M)

152

/Ionomycin (0.167 M) cocktail (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) as a positive control. The tests

153

were set up in duplicates, and the costimulatory anti-CD28 antibody (0.1 µg/mL) was added to

154

the cells during the incubation. Plates were developed using specific monoclonal detection

155

antibodies and fluorophore-conjugated secondary reagents. Finally, plates were treated with a

156

Fluorescence enhancer (Mabtech) to optimize detection and then air-dried. The spots were

157

enumerated using the CTL ImmunoSpot® S6 Universal Analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited,

158

CTL, Shaker Heights, OH), and the number of antigen specific cytokine-secreting spot forming

159

cells (SFCs) per million cells for each stimulation condition was calculated by subtracting the

160

number of spots detected in the medium only wells.

163

Murine immunisation with SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 proteins

164

Neutralising antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 largely target the receptor binding domain present

165

within the Spike S1 protein 24. Therefore, BALB/c mice were given two doses of commercially

166

available Spike S1, 21 days apart (Fig.1A). To test whether adjuvants may alter immunological

167

responses to the immunogen, mice were divided into four groups based on vaccine formulation.

168

The mice receiving S1 protein and CoVaccine HT™ (S1+CoVac), Alhydrogel (S1+Alum), or

169

PBS (S1+PBS) received SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 mixed with either CoVaccine HT™ (“CoVac”),

170

Alhydrogel (“Alum”), or PBS, respectively. One group received CoVaccine HT™ alone as an

171

adjuvant control (Fig. 1A).

172
173

Adjuvants alter immunogenicity and specificity to immunisation

174

Serum analysis revealed high reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific IgG antibodies in

175

S1+CoVac after a single dose while S1+Alum titres were near baseline (Fig.1B). Only one

176

animal showed a detectable titre in the antigen alone group at this time point. Only in the group

177

with CoVaccine HT™ a low level of cross reactivity was observed after the first dose to SARS-

178

CoV S1. On day 35, S1+Alum and S1+PBS displayed significantly higher antibody responses

179

compared to day 14 and variations among individual animals were reduced. S1+CoVac treated

180

animals on day 35 consistently showed very high antibody responses in every animal. Similarly,

181

cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV S1 was greatly increased for all groups on day 35 (Fig.1B). As

182

expected, due to its much lower sequence homology, the SARS-CoV-2 S1 did not induce IgG

183

responses to MERS-CoV S1.

184
185

In patients suffering from COVID-19, high RBD-specific IgG titres have been observed25.

186

However, higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG are associated with patients that did

187

not require intensive care unit treatment while lower titres are associated with increased disease

188

severity26. Therefore, the antibody response kinetics may be an important factor for a successful

189

vaccine candidate. Time-course analysis of IgG responses reveal that adjuvanted S1 may be

190

crucial for strong, early IgG responses with SARS-CoV-2 specificity while a second dose may

191

decrease variability among individual animals and increase cross-reactivity (Fig.1C).

192
193

CoVaccine HT™ improves IgG titres to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S1 proteins

194

To further investigate the matured IgG responses, sera from day 35 were titrated in a four-fold

195

dilution series starting at 1/250 and analysed by microsphere immunoassay (MIA). The

196

S1+Alum and S1+PBS groups showed reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S1 when diluted up to

197

1/256,000, indicating an abundance of antigen-specific IgG in the sera (Fig. 2A). Titrating sera

198

from S1+CoVac however, revealed saturating levels of IgG for five dilutions and detectable IgG

199

levels were present down to a 1/65.5 million dilution. Antiserum to S1+CoVac also showed

200

significantly greater cross reactivity to SARS-CoV S1 compared to the other groups. All groups

201

remained negative for cross reactivity to MERS-CoV S1 (Fig.2A). These data suggest that

202

immunisation with SARS-CoV-2 S1 and CoVaccine HT™ elicits robust antigen-specific IgG

203

response with the expected cross-reactivity profile to include SARS-CoV S1.

204

Increased IgG subclass diversity and enhanced viral neutralising antibody titres with

CoVaccine HT™

206

Adjuvants serving as TLR4 agonists, such as postulated for CoVaccine HT™, elicit a primarily

207

Th1 type response 27,28. Meanwhile, Alhydrogel facilitates a mainly Th2 type response, possibly

208

through NOD-like receptor signalling 29,30. IgG subclass analysis can be used to determine if a

209

Th1 or Th2 response may have been more prominent. Therefore, sera from each S1+adjuvant

210

group were analysed for their subclass composition (Figure 3). Consistent with previous

211

findings, the S1+CoVac group displayed a diverse immunoglobulin response composed of IgG1,

212

IgG2a, and IgG2b subclasses all of which were further elevated after a second dose of vaccine.

213

Low levels of IgG3 were also observed. Alternatively, the Alum and antigen alone groups

214

primarily produced an IgG1 response with some detectable IgM in the Alum group, representing

215

a classical Th2-biased humoral response. Heterogeneous subclass populations such as those

216

observed in the S1+CoVac group are typically associated with Th1 responses while IgG1 is

217

characteristic of a Th2 response. To further investigate the nature of these adjuvant effects, the

218

subclass data were stratified to analyse ratios of Th1 vs Th2 subclasses (Figure 3C). This analysis

219

clearly shows that of the three tested formulations, only S1+CoVac induced a relatively balanced

220

humoral response. Furthermore, only the S1+CoVac formulation was able to induce detectable

221

SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titres as demonstrated in a plaque reduction neutralisation

222

test using wildtype virus (Table 1). PRNT90 and PRNT50 titres for this formulation indicate

223

potent neutralisation (1:1620).

224
225

Adjuvant effect on the SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific INFγ responses

226

We assessed the adjuvant effect of CoVaccine HT™ and Alum on the cellular immune responses

227

directed against SARS-CoV-2 S1 using an IFN- FluoroSpot assay. Individual mouse spleens

228

from each group harvested at day 7 post-second immunisation were processed, and single cell

229

suspensions stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 S1 peptides. The number of IFN- secreting cells

230

from the mice given CoVaccine HT™ was significantly higher than those for mice given Alum

231

or S1 antigen only at two different peptide concentrations (Figure 4). Splenocytes from

232

unvaccinated (naïve) mice did not respond to S1 peptide stimulation with only 2 spot forming

233

cells (SFCs)/106 cells detected. The results suggest that CoVaccine HTTM is a superior adjuvant

234

for induction of an antigen-specific Th1-focused cellular immune response, which is critical for

235

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.

237

4. Discussion

238

The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated global efforts to rapidly develop vaccines against

239

SARS-CoV-2. Many vaccine strategies are being explored, including inactivated virus, non-

240

replicating viral vectors, recombinant protein, DNA, and RNA several of which have reached

241

human clinical trials 7,6. The number of clinically applied adjuvants are limited and include Alum

242

and newer formulations such as MF59 and AS03, both oil-in-water emulsions using squalene 31.

243

The small number of adjuvants approved for clinical use has limited vaccine development in the

244

past and impacts current clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Many approaches use no

245

adjuvant, Alum, MF59, or AS03, however, Novavax is testing the experimental adjuvant Matrix-

246

MTM 32. While Alum is known to primarily enhance a Th2 response, Matrix-MTM and CoVaccine

247

HTTM have both been shown to elicit a Th1 response with recombinant subunits. Due to the

248

previously observed potential for enhanced immunopathology associated with primarily Th2-

249

targeted anti-SARS-CoV vaccines33,34, the development of a COVID-19 vaccine may require

250

testing of a multitude of adjuvants to elicit protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. The

251

squalane-in-water based adjuvant, CoVaccine HTTM, has previously been shown to induce potent

252

virus neutralisation antibody titres and protective efficacy in mice and non-human primates to

253

several infectious agents, and has recently been licensed by Soligenix, Inc. for use in SARS-

254

CoV-2 vaccine development 35-38.

256

In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 alone

257

or in combination with Alum or CoVaccine HTTM as potential adjuvants. Overall, we observed

258

the most potent humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralising antibody

259

responses in the CoVaccine HTTM study group. Day 14 titres (post-dose 1) indicate that this

260

formulation may even be efficacious after administration of a single dose, however, this was not

261

investigated in the current study. Neither antigen alone nor the combination with Alum was able

262

to induce detectable neutralising antibodies with the model antigen utilized in this study. This

263

may be due to slower response kinetics caused by antigen presentation, subclass homogeneity, or

264

Th2 restricted immune responses compared to administering S1 with CoVaccine HTTM.

265
266

Immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines is often inferior in generating robust immune

267

responses compared to other platforms such as those based on live attenuated viruses. As seen

268

here, the (monomeric) S1 domain alone is not adequate for generating a high titre immune

269

response. The addition of CoVaccine HTTM improved antibody titres and response kinetics and

270

proved to induce high titres of antibodies neutralising wild-type SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown

271

by others that SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG titres correlate with viral neutralisation in humans39. Virus

272

neutralising responses in rabbits after two immunisations with 50µg of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and

Emulsigen adjuvant (oil-in-water emulsion) were at 1:160 in the wild-type neutralisation assay,

274

compared to titres at 1:800 achieved when immunising with SARS-CoV-2 RBD 40. Similarly,

275

emulsion-based adjuvants improved kinetics and antibody titres in guinea pigs compared to

276

Alhydrogel or no adjuvant with HIV-1 gp140 immunisation41. This demonstrates the importance

277

of achieving an antigen/adjuvant combination with desirable properties. In our study, post-dose 1

278

titres in the S1+CoVac group resemble post-dose 2 titres with Alum or no adjuvant and may

279

suggest at least partial protection after a single dose. Generating potent immunity after a single

280

dose is an attractive target for any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in development and may improve the

281

impact of a vaccine on the further course of the pandemic.

282
283

The high potency for SARS-CoV-2 S1 in the CoVaccine HTTM formulation may be attributable

284

to the observed immunoglobulin subclass diversity. This indicates CoVaccine HTTM may

285

efficiently induce class switching often considered to increase antibody affinity. Furthermore, a

286

broad IgG subclass composition is key for inducing complement-mediated antibody effector

287

functions as well as neutralisation and opsonisation, which are typically essential for mitigating

288

viral infections. The ideal antibody population has yet to be elucidated for combating SARS-

289

CoV-2. However, our murine serological data suggests kinetics and subclass diversity may be

290

key to developing effective immune responses. Additionally, we have demonstrated that

291

CoVaccine HTTM is not only a suitable adjuvant for vaccination but is preferable to Alhydrogel

292

given the quality of the humoral response due to rapid onset, balance, overall magnitude of the

293

response, as well as significantly greater cell-mediated immune responses.

294
295

Concerns have been raised regarding antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) with SARS-CoV-

296

2 infection or immunisation. This phenomenon occurs when non-neutralising or poorly binding

297

antibodies interact with Fc receptors on antigen presenting cells and facilitate infection. This

298

interaction increases pro-inflammatory cytokine production which exacerbates

299

immunopathology 42. ADE was previously observed with SARS-CoV infection caused by anti-

300

Spike antibodies through the FcγR and FcγRII pathways 43,44. In respiratory syncytial virus

301

infections, a Th2 response alone can lead to aberrant immune responses associated with ADE

302

caused by either a prior infection or immunisation 45,46. For these reasons, caution may be

303

warranted when using Alum as an adjuvant for SARS-CoV-2, at least for the subunit protein

304

used in this study. Additionally, our data suggest that antigen alone may also drive a

305

predominantly Th2 type response with recombinant S1 antigen immunisation in mice. In contrast,

306

the subunit protein with CoVaccine HTTM produces neutralising antibodies while boosting Th1

307

responses which may increase durability, vaccine safety, and efficacy.

308
309

Previous studies of SARS-CoV, the most closely related human betacoronavirus to SARS-CoV-

310

2, have shown that recovered patients develop substantial T cell responses, which persist for up

311

to 11 years 47,48. In addition, animal studies indicated that T cell responses play a crucial role in

312

protection against SARS-CoV infection49-51, suggesting that it is most likely that T cell responses

313

to SARS-CoV-2 are protective. Despite very limited understanding on the adaptive immune

314

responses to SARS-CoV-2, it has been reported that virus-specific T cell responses are detected

315

in 70% to 100 % of COVID-19 convalescent patients and about 50% of the CD4+ T cell

316

response is directed against S protein and correlates with the magnitude of anti-S antibody

317

response52. Furthermore, the majority of CD4+ T cells appears to be Th1 type with little or no Th2

318

cytokine secretion detected52. This suggests that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate consisting of

319

S protein can induce a robust CD4+ T cell response that recapitulates the elicited immune

320

response during the natural infection. In this study we showed that SARS-CoV-2 S1 adjuvanted

321

with CoVaccine HTTM elicits a strong IFN- secreting cellular immune response upon peptide

322

stimulation, indicating the induction of a Th1-targeted T cell response, which highlights the

323

potential of this antigen/adjuvant combination to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

324

However, further in-depth analysis of cellular immune responses will be needed to characterize

325

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and their correlation with the antibody titres.

326
327

Altogether, CoVaccine HTTM is an effective adjuvant that in combination with a properly chosen

328

recombinant subunit protein promotes rapid induction of balanced humoral and cellular immune

329

responses and allows accelerated preclinical and clinical development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

330

to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
