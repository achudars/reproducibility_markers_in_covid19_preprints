54

Antibodies are a principal determinant of immunity for most RNA viruses and have

55

promise to reduce infection or disease during major epidemics. The novel

56

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with millions of infections

57

and hundreds of thousands of deaths to date1,2. In response, we used a rapid

58

antibody discovery platform to isolate hundreds of human monoclonal antibodies

59

(mAbs) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We stratify these mAbs into five

60

major classes based on their reactivity to subdomains of S protein as well as their

61

cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV. Many of these mAbs inhibit infection of authentic

62

SARS-CoV-2 virus, with most neutralizing mAbs recognizing the receptor-binding

63

domain (RBD) of S. This work defines sites of vulnerability on SARS-CoV-2 S and

64

demonstrates the speed and robustness of new antibody discovery methodologies.

65
66

Human mAbs to the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein mediate immunity to other

67

betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV3-7 and Middle East respiratory syndrome

68

(MERS)8-17. Because of this, we and others have hypothesized that human mAbs may

69

have promise for use in prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, or treatment of SARS-

70

CoV-2 infection18. MAbs can neutralize betacoronaviruses by several mechanisms

71

including blocking of attachment of the S protein RBD to a receptor on host cells (which

72

for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-21 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2])12. We

73

hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein would induce diverse human neutralizing

74

antibodies following natural infection. While antibody discovery usually takes months

75

to years, there is an urgent need to both characterize the human immune response to

76

SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop potential medical countermeasures. Using Zika

77

virus as a simulated pandemic pathogen and leveraging recent technological advances

78

in synthetic genomics and single-cell sequencing, we recently isolated hundreds of

79

human mAbs from a single B cell suspension and tested them in vitro for neutralization

80

and for protection in small animals and nonhuman primates, all within 78 days19. Using

81

similar methodologies and further efficiency improvements, we sought to obtain

82

human mAbs rapidly for SARS-CoV-2 from the B cells of some of the first human

83

subjects identified with infection in North America. We used an approach similar to

84

that in our previous technical demonstration with Zika, however, for the SARS-CoV-2

85

discovery effort we report here we used several different workflows in parallel (Figure

86

1, Table S2), which we completed in an expedited time frame (Figure 1).

87
88

We first developed or obtained antigens and recombinant proteins necessary for

89

identifying and isolating antigen-reactive B cells. We synthesized a cDNA encoding a

90

stabilized trimeric prefusion ectodomain of S protein (S2Pecto)20, expressed the protein in

91

293F cells, and verified the presence of the prefusion conformation by electron

92

microscopy (Figure S1). We also synthesized and expressed the S protein receptor

93

binding domain (SRBD) and obtained recombinant S protein N terminal domain (SNTD)

94

that had been prepared by other academic or commercial sources. Using these tools, we

95

designed a mAb discovery approach focused on identifying naturally occurring human

96

mAbs specific for S.

97
98

We obtained blood samples from four subjects infected in China who were among the

99

earliest identified SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in North America (Table S1). These

100

subjects had a history of recent laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection acquired in

101

Wuhan or Beijing, China. The samples were obtained 35 days (subject 1; the case

102

identified in the U.S.21), 36 days (subject 2), or 50 days (subjects 3 and 4) after the onset

103

of symptoms. We tested plasma or serum specimens from the four subjects infected

104

with SARS-CoV-2, or from a healthy donor (subject 5) as control. Serum/plasma

105

antibody ELISA binding assays using S2Pecto, SRBD, or SNTD protein from SARS-CoV-2 or

106

S2Pecto protein from SARS-CoV revealed that the previously infected subjects had

107

circulating antibodies that recognized each of the proteins tested, with highest reactivity

108

against SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto and SRBD proteins (Figure 2a). Each of the immune subjects

109

also had circulating antibodies that bound to SARS-CoV S2Pecto. The healthy donor

110

serum antibodies did not react with any of the antigens. B cells were enriched from

111

PBMCs by negative selection using antibody-coated magnetic beads and stained with

112

phenotyping antibodies specific for CD19, IgD, and IgM. Analytical flow cytometry was

113

performed to assess the frequency of antigen-specific memory B cells for each donor.

114

We identified class-switched memory B cells by gating for an IgD-/IgM-/CD19+

115

population (Figure 2b). From this memory B cell population, we identified antigen-

116

reactive cells using biotinylated recombinant S2Pecto protein or biotinylated RBD fused

117

to mouse Fc (RBD-mFc) . Subjects 1 and 2 had very low frequencies of antigen-specific

118

memory B cells that were not greater than two-fold above the background staining

119

frequency in a non-immune sample (subject 6) (Figure 2c). In contrast to subjects 1 and

120

2, subjects 3 and 4 were 2 weeks later in convalescence and exhibited 0.62 or 1.22 % of

121

class-switched B cells that reacted with antigen (Figure 2c). Subjects 3 and 4 also

122

exhibited high titers in a serum antibody focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT)

123

with an authentic SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA/1/2020) (Figure 2d). Therefore, we focused

124

subsequent efforts on sorting B cells from the specimens of subjects 3 and 4, which were

125

pooled for efficiency. The pooled memory B cell suspension had frequencies for S2Pecto

126

or RBD-mFc that were 0.81 or 0.19% of the IgD-/IgM-/CD19+ population, respectively

127

(Figure 2e). The bulk sorted S2Pecto- or RBD-mFc-specific B cells were stimulated on a

128

feeder layer with CD40L, IL-21 and BAFF22, and the secreted antibodies in the resulting

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091462; this version posted May 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

129

cell culture supernatants exhibited neutralizing activity against the WA1/2020 strain

130

(Figure 2f). After 7 days in culture, these activated B cells were removed from the

131

feeder layers. Roughly half of these B cells were single-cell sequenced and antibody

132

genes were synthesized as previously described19. The remaining cells were loaded onto

133

a Berkeley Lights Beacon optofluidic instrument in a novel plasma cell survival

134

medium, and antigen reactivity of secreted antibody from individual B cells was

135

measured for thousands of cells (Figure S2). Antigen-reactive B cells were exported

136

from the instrument and the heavy and light chain genes from single B cells were

137

sequenced and cloned into immunoglobulin expression vectors.

138
139

Using the parallel workflows, we isolated 386 recombinant SARS-CoV-2-reactive

140

human mAbs that expressed sufficiently well as recombinant IgG to characterize the

141

activity of the mAb. The recombinant mAbs were tested for binding in ELISA to

142

recombinant monomeric SRBD or SNTD of SARS-CoV-2 or trimeric S2Pecto proteins of

143

SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV (Figure 3a) and in a cell-impedance based SARS-CoV-2

144

neutralization assay with WA1/2020 strain SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-furin cells (Figure S3).

145

The ELISA and neutralization screening assays revealed that the antibodies could be

146

grouped into five binding patterns based on domain recognition and cross-reactivity

147

(Figure 3b). Comparison of binding patterns with full or partial neutralizing activity in

148

a rapid cell-impedance-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test (Figure 3c) showed

149

clearly that most of the neutralizing antibodies mapped to the RBD, revealing the RBD

150

as the principal site of vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in these subjects. We

151

examined the sequences for the 386 antibodies to assess the diversity of antigen-specific

152

B cell clonotypes discovered. The analysis showed that among the 386 mAbs, 324

153

unique amino sequences were present and 311 unique VH-JH-CDRH3-VL-JL-CDRL3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091462; this version posted May 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

154

clonotypes were represented, with diverse usage of antibody variable genes (Figure 3d).

155

The CDR3 amino acid length distributions in the heavy and light chains were typical of

156

human repertoires (Figure 3e)23. The high relatedness of sequences to the inferred

157

unmutated ancestor antibody genes observed for this panel of antibodies (Figure 3f)

158

contrasts with the much higher frequencies seen in B cell recall responses against

159

common human pathogens like influenza24. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2

160

antibodies likely were induced during the primary response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

161

and not by a recall response to a distantly related seasonal coronavirus. To validate the

162

neutralizing activity measured in the cell-impedance-based neutralization test, we also

163

confirmed neutralization for representative mAbs in a quantitative FRNT assay for

164

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3g) or a neutralization assay with a SARS-CoV luciferase reporter

165

virus (Figure 3h). Together, these results confirmed that mAbs recognizing multiple

166

epitopes on S were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and cross-react with SARS-CoV, with

167

most neutralizing mAbs specific for the RBD of S.

168
169

Here, we coupled single-B-cell RNAseq methods with high-throughput IgG micro-

170

expression and real-time neutralization assays to isolate and profile a large number of

171

neutralizing antibodies in a period of only weeks after sample acquisition. As we show,

172

recent advances in single-cell sequencing and gene synthesis have enabled antibody

173

discovery at unprecedented scale and speed. In our particular example, sequences of

174

confirmed neutralizing antibodies were transferred to downstream manufacturing

175

partners only 18 days after antigen-specific cell sorting. However, given the need for

176

affinity maturation and the development of a mature B cell response there are limits on

177

the timeline from infection to isolation of potent neutralizing antibodies with

178

therapeutic promise. It has been previously shown for Ebola virus infection that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091462; this version posted May 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

179

potently neutralizing antibodies are not easily isolated from memory B cells until later

180

timepoints in the first year after infection25,26. It is likely that our success in isolating

181

neutralizing antibodies from subjects 3 and 4 here at 50 days after onset, but not from

182

subjects 1 and 2 at 35 or 36 days after onset, reflected additional maturation of the

183

memory B cell response that occurred in the additional two weeks convalescence.

184

Overall, our work illustrates the promise of coupling recent technological advances for

185

antibody discovery and defines the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S as a major site of

186

vulnerability for vaccine design and therapeutic antibody development. The most

187

potent neutralizing human mAbs isolated here also could serve as candidate biologics

188

to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

b. MAbs binding to each of four S proteins or subdomains. The figure shows a

288

heatmap for binding of 386 mAbs expressed recombinantly, representing optical

289

density (O.D.) values collected at 450 nm for each antigen (range 0.035 to 4.5). White

290

indicates lack of detectable binding, while blue indicates binding, with darker blue

291

indicating higher O.D. values.

292

c. Screening test for neutralizing activity. Each mAb was tested in a cell-impedance

293

based neutralization test (Figure S3) using Vero-furin cells and live WA1/2020 strain

294

SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL3 laboratory. Green indicates full protection of cells (full

295

neutralization), purple indicates partial protection of cells, (partial neutralization), and

296

white indicates neutralizing activity was not detected. Based on both binding and

297

neutralization, we grouped the mAbs into classes. Class I mAbs bind to both S2Pecto and

298

SRBD proteins and are SARS-CoV-2 specific; Class II mAbs also bind to both S2Pecto and

299

SRBD proteins and cross-react with SARS-CoV; Class III mAbs bind to both S2Pecto and

300

SNTD proteins and are mostly SARS-CoV-2 specific; Class IV mAbs bind only to S2Pecto

301

protein and are SARS-CoV-2 specific; Class V mAbs bind only to S2Pecto protein and

302

cross-react with SARS-CoV.

303

d. Heatmap showing usage of antibody variable gene segments for variable (V) and

304

joining (J) genes. Of the 386 antibodies tested in (b) and (c) above, 324 were found to

305

have unique sequences, and those unique sequences were analyzed for genetic features.

306

The frequency counts are derived from the total number of unique sequences with the

307

corresponding V and J genes. The V/J frequency counts then were transformed into a z-

308

score by first subtracting the average frequency, then normalizing by the standard

309

deviation of each subject. Red denotes more common gene usage, while blue denotes

310

less common gene usage.

e. CDR3 amino acid length distribution. The CDR3 of each sequence was determined

312

using PyIR software. The amino acid length of each CDR3 was counted. The

313

distribution of CDR3 amino acid lengths for heavy or light chains then was plotted as a

314

histogram and fitted using kernel density estimation for the curves.

315

f. Divergence from inferred germline gene sequences. The number of mutations from

316

each inferred unmutated ancestor sequence in the region spanning from antibody

317

framework region 1 to 4 was counted up for each chain. These numbers then were

318

transformed into percent values and plotted as violin plots.

319

g. Quantitative test for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 using FRNT.

320

Representative mAbs that exhibited full neutralizing activity in the screening

321

neutralization test in (c) above using micro-scale expression were prepared in midi-

322

scale as purified IgG and tested in a serial dilution series in the FRNT with live

323

WA1/2020 strain SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate neutralizing potency of class-

324

representative mAbs. % neutralization of virus infection (relative to control wells with

325

no mAb) at each dilution is shown. Values shown are the mean of two technical

326

replicates, and error bars denote the standard deviation for each point.

327

h. Quantitative test for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV using a nano-

328

luciferase virus. A representative purified mAb that exhibited cross-reactive binding to

329

SARS-CoV S2Pecto protein in (b) above and that also exhibited full neutralizing activity

330

in the screening neutralization test in (c) above was tested in a serial dilution series in a

331

neutralization test with a recombinant, reverse-genetics-derived SARS-CoV encoding a

332

nano-luciferase reporter gene, and reduction of luciferase activity was used to calculate

333

% neutralization. Values shown are the mean of two technical replicates, and error bars

334

denote the standard deviation for each point.

Research subjects. We studied four subjects in North America with recent laboratory-

4

confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection that were acquired in China (Table S1). The

5

studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Vanderbilt University Medical

6

Center, and subsite studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the

7

University of Washington or the Research Ethics Board of the University of Toronto. Samples

8

were obtained after written informed consent. Subject 1 (35-year-old male) was the earliest

9

reported case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the U.S. who presented with disease in Seattle, WA

10

on January 19, 20201, a blood sample was obtained for study on February 19, 2020. Subject 2

11

(52-year-old female) was infected following close exposure in Beijing, China to an infected

12

person from Wuhan, China during the period between January 23 to January 29, 2020. She

13

presented with mild respiratory disease symptoms from February 1 to 4, 2020 that occurred

14

after travel to Madison, Wisconsin, USA. She obtained a diagnosis of infection by testing at

15

the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on February 5, 2020. Blood samples were obtained for

16

study on March 7 and March 8, 2020. Subject 3 (a 56-year-old male) and subject 4 (a 56-year-

17

old female) are a married couple and residents of Wuhan, China who traveled to Toronto,

18

Canada on January 22, 2020. Subject 3 first developed a cough without fever on January 20,

19

2020 in the city of Wuhan, where he had a normal chest x-ray on that day. He flew to Canada

20

with persisting cough and arrived in Canada January 22, 2020 where he became febrile. He

21

presented to a hospital in Toronto, January 23, 2020 complaining of fever, cough and

22

shortness of breath; a nasopharyngeal swab was positive by PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. His

23

chest x-ray at that time was abnormal, and he was admitted for non-ICU impatient care. He

24

improved gradually with supportive care, was discharged January 30, 2020 and rapidly

25

became asymptomatic except for a residual dry cough that persisted for a month. He had a

negative nasopharyngeal swab PCR test on February 19, 2020. Subject 4 is the wife of subject 3

27

who traveled with her husband from Wuhan. She was never symptomatic with respiratory

28

symptoms or fever but was tested because of her exposure. Her nasopharyngeal swab was

29

positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, on January 24, 2020; repeat testing in followup on February

30

21, 2020 was negative. PBMCs were obtained by leukopheresis from subjects 3 and 4 on

31

March 10, 2020, which was 50 days since the symptom onset of subject 3. Samples were

32

transferred to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, USA on March 14,

Cell culture. Vero E6 (CRL-1586, American Type Culture Collection (American Type

36

Culture Collection, ATCC), Vero CCL81 (ATCC), HEK293 (ATCC), and HEK293T

37

(ATCC) were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium

38

(DMEM) containing 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM

39

HEPES pH 7.3, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 100 U/mL of

40

penicillin–streptomycin. Vero-furin cells were obtained from T. Pierson (NIH) and have

41

been described previously2. Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, A1452) were

42

maintained at 37°C in 8% CO2 in Expi293F Expression Medium (ThermoFisher

43

Scientific, A1435102). ExpiCHO cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, A29127) were

44

maintained at 37°C in 8% CO2 in ExpiCHO Expression Medium (ThermoFisher

45

Scientific, A2910002). Mycoplasma testing of Expi293F and ExpiCHO cultures was

CCL81 cells and titrated by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. All work with infectious SARS-

52

CoV-2 was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine or UNC-Chapel Hill

53

Institutional Biosafety Committees and conducted in approved BSL3 facilities using

54

appropriate powered air purifying respirators and personal protective equipment.

56

Recombinant antigens and proteins. A gene encoding the ectodomain of a prefusion

57

conformation-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S2Pecto) protein was synthesized and cloned into a

58

DNA plasmid expression vector for mammalian cells. A similarly designed S protein antigen

59

with two prolines and removal of the furin cleavage site for stabilization of the prefusion form

60

of S was reported previously3. Briefly, this gene includes the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 (to

61

residue 1,208), a T4 fibritin trimerization domain, an AviTag site-specific biotinylation

62

sequence, and a C-terminal 8x-His tag. To stabilize the construct in the prefusion

63

conformation, we included substitutions K968P and V969P and mutated the furin cleavage

64

site at residues 682-685 from RRAR to ASVG. This recombinant spike 2P-stabilized protein

65

(designated here as S2Pecto) was isolated by metal affinity chromatography on HisTrap Excel

66

columns (GE Healthcare), and protein preparations were purified further by size-exclusion

67

chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). The presence of

68

trimeric, prefusion conformation S protein was verified by negative-stain electron microscopy

69

(Figure S1). To express the SRBD subdomain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, residues 319-541 were

70

cloned into a mammalian expression vector downstream of an IL-2 signal peptide and

71

upstream of a thrombin cleavage site, an AviTag, and a 6x-His tag. RBD protein fused to

72

mouse IgG1 Fc domain (designated RBD-mFc), was purchased from Sino Biological (40592-

73

V05H). For B cell labeling and sorting, RBD-mFc and S2Pecto proteins were biotinylated using

74

the EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation Kit and vendor's protocol (ThermoFisher

75

Scientific, 21435).

Electron microscopy (EM) stain grid preparation and imaging of SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto

78

protein. For screening and imaging of negatively-stained (NS) SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto

79

protein, approximately 3 µL of the sample at concentrations of about 10 to 15 µg/mL

80

was applied to a glow discharged grid with continuous carbon film on 400 square mesh

81

copper EM grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). The grids were stained

82

with 0.75% uranyl formate (UF)4. Images were recorded on a Gatan US4000 4k × 4k

83

CCD camera using an FEI TF20 (TFS) transmission electron microscope operated at 200

84

keV and control with SerialEM5. All images were taken at 50,000´ magnification with a

85

pixel size of 2.18 Å/pix in low-dose mode at a defocus of 1.5 to 1.8 μm. Total dose for

86

the micrographs was ~25 e−/Å2. Image processing was performed using the

87

cryoSPARC software package6. Images were imported, and particles were CTF

88

estimated. The images then were denoised and picked with Topaz7. The particles were

89

extracted with a box size of 256 pixels and binned to 128 pixels. 2D class averages were

90

performed and good classes selected for ab-initio model and refinement without

91

symmetry (see also Table S3 for details). For EM model docking of SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto

92

protein, the closed model (PDB: 6VXX) was used in Chimera8 for docking to the EM

93

map (see also Table S3 for details).

95

Human subject selection and target-specific memory B cells isolation. B cell responses to

96

SARS-CoV-2 in PBMCs from a cohort of four subjects with documented previous infection

97

with the virus were analyzed for antigen specificity, and PBMCs were used for SARS-CoV-2-

98

specific B cell enrichment. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific B cells was

99

identified by antigen-specific staining with either biotinylated S2Pecto or RBD-mFc protein.

Briefly, B cells were purified magnetically (STEMCELL Technologies) and stained with anti-

101

CD19-APC (clone HIB19, 982406), -IgD-FITC (clone LA6-2, 348206), and -IgM-FITC (clone

102

MNM-88, 314506) phenotyping antibodies (BioLegend) and biotinylated antigen. A 4′,6-

103

diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain was used as a viability dye to discriminate dead cells.

104

Antigen-labeled class-switched memory B cell-antigen complexes (CD19+IgM-IgD-Ag+DAPI-)

105

were detected with a R-phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin conjugate (ThermoFisher

106

Scientific, S866). After identification of the two subjects with the highest B cell response

107

against SARS-CoV-2 (subjects 3 and 4), target-specific memory B cells were isolated by flow

108

cytometric sorting using an SH800 cell sorter (Sony) from pooled PBMCs of these two

109

subjects, after labeling of B cells with either biotinylated S2Pecto or RBD-mFc proteins.

110
111

Overall, from > 4 x 108 PBMCs, 2,126 RBD-mFc-reactive and 5,544 S2Pecto protein-reactive B

112

cells were sorted and subjected to further analysis. Several methods were implemented for the

113

preparation of sorted B cells for sequencing. Approximately 4,500 sorted cells were subjected

114

to direct sequencing immediately after flow cytometric sorting. The remaining cells were

115

expanded in culture for eight days in the presence of irradiated 3T3 feeder cells that were

116

engineered to express human CD40L, IL-21, and BAFF, as described previously9. The

117

expanded lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) secreted high levels of S protein-specific

118

antibodies, as confirmed by ELISA to detect antigen-specific human antibodies in culture

119

supernatants. Approximately 40,000 expanded LCLs were sequenced using the Chromium

120

sequencing method (10x Genomics).

121
122

Microfluidic device selection of single antigen-specific B cells. Activated memory B

123

cells were screened using Berkeley Lights’ Beacon®™ optofluidic system. Purified B cell

124

samples were imported automatically onto OptoSelect™ 11k chips in a novel

125

plasmablast survival medium that promotes antibody secretion and preserves cell

126

viability10. Single-cell penning was then performed using OEP™ technology in which

127

light is used to transfer B cells into individual nanoliter-volume chambers

128

(NanoPens™). Using this light-based manipulation, thousands of LCLs were

129

transferred into pens across multiple chips in each workflow. We performed an on-chip,

130

fluorescence-based assay to identify antibodies that bound SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto or RBD-

131

mFc protein. We prepared 6- to 8-micron and 10- to 14-micron RBD-mFc-conjugated

132

beads by coupling biotinylated RBD-mFc protein to streptavidin-coated polystyrene

133

particles (Spherotech Inc.). We prepared 6- to 8-micron S2Pecto protein-conjugated beads

134

by coupling full-length S2Pecto protein to streptavidin-coated polystyrene particles.

135

Assays consisted of mixing beads conjugated with the RBD-mFc or S2Pecto proteins with

136

fluorescently-labeled anti-human secondary antibodies (AF568, Thermo Fisher

137

Scientific) and importing this assay mixture into OptoSelect 11k chips. Antigen-specific

138

antibodies bound the antigen-conjugated beads, which then sequestered the fluorescent

139

secondary antibody. Cells secreting antigen-specific antibodies were identified by

140

locating the NanoPens immediately adjacent to the fluorescent beads. Antigen-specific

141

cells of interest were exported from specific NanoPen chambers to individual wells of

142

96-well RT-PCR plates containing lysis buffer.

Sequencing and cloning of single antigen-specific B cells. After export from the Beacon,

145

antibody heavy and light chain sequences for B cells secreting antibodies with RBD-mFc- or

146

S2Pecto-binding antibodies were amplified and recovered using components of the

147

Opto™ Plasma B Discovery cDNA Synthesis Kit (Berkeley Lights). Antibody heavy and light

148

chain sequences were amplified through a 5'RACE approach using the kit's included "BCR

149

Primer 2" forward primer and isotype-specific reverse primers. The 5'-RACE amplified cDNA

150

was sequenced using the Pacific Biosciences Sequel platform using the SMRTbell Barcoded

151

Adapt Complete Prep-96 kit (Pacific Biosciences) and a 6-hour movie time. In a redundant

152

sequencing approach, heavy and light chain sequences were amplified using a cocktail of

153

custom V and J gene-specific primers (similar to previously described human Ig gene-specific

154

primers11) from the original 5'-RACE-amplified cDNA while the products of the gene-specific

155

amplification were sent for Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ). The sequences generated by these

156

two approaches were analyzed using our Python-based antibody variable gene analysis tool

157

(PyIR; https://github.com/crowelab/PyIR)12 to identify which V and J genes most closely

158

matched the nucleotide sequence. Heavy and light chain sequences were then amplified from

159

the original cDNA using cherry-picked V and J gene-specific primers most closely

160

corresponding to the V and J gene calls made by PyIR. These primers include adapter

161

sequences which allow Gibson-based cloning into a monocistronic IgG1 expression vector

162

(pMCis_G1). Similar to a vector described below, this vector contains an enhanced 2A

163

sequence and GSG linker that allows simultaneous expression of mAb heavy and light chain

164

genes from a single construct upon transfection13. The pMCis_G1 vector was digested using

165

the New England BioLabs restriction enzyme FspI, and the amplified paired heavy and light

166

chain sequences were cloned through Gibson assembly using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly

167

Master Mix. After recovered sequences were cloned into pMCis_G1 expression constructs,

168

recombinant antibodies were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and purified

169

by affinity chromatography as detailed below. Antigen-binding activity was confirmed using

170

plate-based ELISA.

172

Generation of single-cell antibody variable genes profiling libraries. As an alternative

173

approach, we also used a second major approach for isolation of SARS-CoV-2-reactive

174

antibodies. In some experiments, the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J workflow with B-cell only

175

enrichment option was used for generating linked heavy-chain and light-chain antibody

176

profiling libraries. Approximately 2,866 directly sorted S2Pecto or 1,626 RBD-mFc protein-

177

specific B cells were split evenly into two replicates each and separately added to 50 μL of RT

178

Reagent Mix, 5.9 μL of Poly-dt RT Primer, 2.4 μL of Additive A and 10 μL of RT Enzyme Mix

179

B to complete the Reaction Mix as per the vendor’s protocol, which then was loaded directly

180

onto a Chromium chip (10x Genomics). Similarly, for the remaining sorted cells that were

181

expanded in bulk, approximately 40,000 cells from two separate sorting approaches were split

182

evenly across four reactions and processed separately as described above before loading onto

183

a Chromium chip. The libraries were prepared following the User Guide for Chromium

184

Single Cell V(D)J Reagents kits (CG000086_REV C).

Next generation DNA sequence analysis of antibody variable genes. Chromium Single Cell

187

V(D)J B-Cell enriched libraries were quantified, normalized and sequenced according to the

188

User Guide for Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagents kits (CG000086_REV C). The two

189

enriched libraries from direct flow cytometric cell sorting were sequenced on a NovaSeq

190

sequencer (Illumina) with a NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (300 cycles) (Illumina). The four

191

enriched libraries from bulk expansion were sequenced on a NovaSeq sequencer with a

192

NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit (300 cycles (Illumina). All enriched V(D)J libraries were targeted

193

for sequencing depth of at least 5,000 raw read pairs per cell. Following sequencing, all

samples were demultiplexed and processed through the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software

single heavy and light chain sequence were processed using PyIR. We considered heavy and

201

light chain encoding gene pairs productive and retained them for additional downstream

202

processing if they met the following criteria: 1) did not contain a stop codon, 2) encoded an

203

intact CDR3 and 3) contained an in-frame junctional region. The second phase of processing

204

eliminated redundant sequences (those with identical amino acid sequences). Any antibody

205

variant that was designated as an IgM isotype (based on the sequence and assignment using

206

the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger V(D)J software [version 2.1.1]) was removed from

207

consideration (while IgG and IgA isotype antibodies were retained). The identities of

208

antibody variable gene segments, CDRs, and mutations from inferred germline gene

209

segments were determined by using PyIR.

210
211

Antibody gene synthesis. Sequences of selected mAbs were synthesized using a rapid high-

212

throughput cDNA synthesis platform (Twist Bioscience) and subsequently cloned into an

213

IgG1 monocistronic expression vector (designated as pTwist-mCis_G1) for mammalian cell

214

culture mAb secretion. This vector contains an enhanced 2A sequence and GSG linker that

215

allows simultaneous expression of mAb heavy and light chain genes from a single construct

216

upon transfection13.

218

MAb production and purification. For high-throughput production of recombinant mAbs,

219

we adopted approaches designated as “micro-scale” or “midi-scale”. For “micro-scale”

220

mAbs expression, we performed micro-scale transfection (~1 mL per antibody) of CHO cell

221

cultures using the Gibco™ ExpiCHO™ Expression System and a protocol for deep 96-well

222

blocks (ThermoFisher Scientific) as detailed in accompanying manuscript14. Briefly,

223

synthesized antibody-encoding lyophilized DNA was reconstituted in OptiPro serum-free

224

medium (OptiPro SFM) and used for transfection of ExpiCHO cell cultures into 96-deep-

225

well blocks. For high-throughput micro-scale mAbs purification, clarified culture

226

supernatants were incubated with MabSelect SuRe resin (Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare

227

Life Sciences), washed with PBS, eluted, buffer-exchanged into PBS using Zeba™ Spin

228

Desalting Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at 4°C until use. For “midi-scale”

229

mAbs expression, we performed transfection (~15 mL per antibody) of CHO cell cultures

230

using the Gibco™ ExpiCHO™ Expression System and protocol for 50 mL mini bioreactor

231

tubes (Corning) as described by the vendor. For high-throughput midi-scale mAb

232

purification, culture supernatants were purified using HiTrap MabSelect SuRe (Cytiva,

233

formerly GE Healthcare Life Sciences) on a 24-column parallel protein chromatography

234

system (Protein BioSolutions). Purified mAbs were buffer-exchanged into PBS,

235

concentrated using Amicon® Ultra-4 50KDa Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Sigma) and

236

stored at 4°C until use.

237
238

ELISA binding screening assays. Wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with

239

purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein, SARS-CoV-2 SRBD protein, SARS-CoV-2 SNTD

240

(kindly provided by Nicole Kallewaard-Lelay, Astra Zeneca) or SARS-CoV S protein

241

(kindly provided by Sandhya Bangaru and Andrew Ward, The Scripps Research Institute)

242

at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk and 2% normal goat serum

243

in DPBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (DPBS-T) for 1 hr. For mAb screening assays, CHO cell

244

culture supernatants or purified mAbs were diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer, added to the

245

wells, and incubated for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The bound antibodies were detected

246

using goat anti-human IgG conjugated with HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Southern

247

Biotech) and TMB (3,3¢,5,5¢-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

248

Color development was monitored, 1N hydrochloric acid was added to stop the reaction,

249

and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer (Biotek). For dose-

250

response assays, serial dilutions of purified mAbs were applied to the wells in triplicate,

251

and mAb binding was detected as detailed above. Half-maximal effective concentration

252

(EC50) values for binding were determined using Prism v8.0 software (GraphPad) after log

253

transformation of mAb concentration using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear regression

254

analysis.

255
256

Real-time cell analysis assay (RTCA). To screen for neutralizing activity in the panel of

257

recombinantly expressed mAbs, we used a high-throughput and quantitative real-time cell

258

analysis (RTCA) assay and xCelligence RTCA HT Analyzer (ACEA Biosciences Inc.) that

259

assesses kinetic changes in cell physiology, including virus-induced cytopathic effect

260

(CPE). Twenty (20) μL of cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was

261

added to each well of a 96-well E-plate using a ViaFlo384 liquid handler (Integra

262

Biosciences) to obtain background reading. Six thousand (6,000) Vero-furin cells in 20 μL of

263

cell culture medium were seeded per each well, and the plate was placed on the analyzer.

264

Sensograms were visualized using RTCA HT software version 1.0.1 (ACEA Biosciences

265

Inc). For a screening neutralization assay, equal amounts of virus were mixed with micro-

266

scale purified Abs in a total volume of 40 μL using DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS as a

267

diluent and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in 5% CO2. At ~17-20 hrs after seeding the cells, the

268

virus-mAb mixtures were added to the cells in 384-well E-plates. Wells containing virus

269

only (in the absence of mAb) and wells containing only Vero cells in medium were

270

included as controls. Plates were measured every 8-12 hours for 48 to 72 hrs to assess virus

271

neutralization. Micro-scale antibodies were assessed in four 5-fold dilutions (starting from

272

a 1:20 sample dilution), and their concentrations were not normalized. In some experiments

273

mAbs were tested in triplicate using a single (1:20) dilution. Neutralization was calculated

274

as the percent of maximal cell index in control wells without virus minus cell index in

275

control (virus-only) wells that exhibited maximal CPE at 40 to 48 hrs after applying virus-

276

antibody mixture to the cells. A mAb was classified as fully neutralizing if it completely

277

inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE at the highest tested concentration, while a mAb was

278

classified as partially neutralizing if it delayed but did not fully prevent CPE at the highest

279

tested concentration. Representative sensograms for fully neutralizing and partially

280

neutralizing mAbs are shown in Figure S3. For mAb potency ranking experiments,

281

individual mAbs identified as fully neutralizing from the screening study were assessed by

282

FRNT.

283
284

Sequence analysis of antigen-reactive mAb sequences. Sequences of the 386 mAbs

285

isolated by different approaches were combined and run through PyIR to identity the V

286

genes, J genes, CDR3 lengths, and percent identity to germline, and sequence within the

287

FR1-FR4 region for both heavy and light chains. Sequences were then deduplicated on

288

the nucleotide sequences identified in the FR1-FR4 region. Among the 386 mAbs, there

289

were 324 unique nucleotide sequences that were analyzed for V/D/J gene usage, CDR3

290

length, and somatic mutation. First, the number of sequences with corresponding V and

291

J genes were counted. The V/J frequency counts were then transformed into a z-score

292

by first subtracting away the average frequency then normalizing by the standard

293

deviation of each subject. The z-score was then plotted as a heatmap using python

294

seaborn library. The amino acid length of each CDR3 was counted. The distribution of

295

CDR3 amino acid lengths were then plotted as histograms and fitted using kernel

296

density estimation for the curves using python seaborn library. The number of

297

mutations from each inferred germ-line sequence starting from FR-1 to FR4 was

298

counted up for each chain. This number was then transformed into a percentage value.

299

These values are then plotted as a categorical distribution plot as a violin plot using the

300

python seaborn.catplot library.

302

Focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated

303

with 102 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hr at 37°C. The mAb–virus complexes were added to

304

Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates for 1 hr at 37°C. Subsequently, cells were

305

overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)

306

supplemented to contain 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Plates were fixed 30 hrs later by

307

removing overlays and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The

308

plates were incubated sequentially with 1 µg/mL of rCR3022 anti-S antibody15 and

309

horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG in PBS supplemented

310

with 0.1% (w/v) saponin (Sigma) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). SARS-CoV-2-

311

infected cell foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and

312

quantitated on an ImmunoSpot 5.0.37 Macro Analyzer (Cellular Technologies).

313
314

SARS-CoV neutralization assays using SARS-CoV luciferase reporter virus. Full-

315

length viruses expressing luciferase were designed and recovered via reverse genetics

316

and described previously.16,17 Viruses were titered in Vero E6 USAMRID cell culture

317

monolayers to obtain a relative light units (RLU) signal of at least 20X the cell-only

318

control background. Vero E6 USAMRID cells were plated at 20,000 cells per well the

319

day prior in clear-bottom black-walled 96-well plates (Corning #3904). Neutralizing

320

antibodies were diluted serially 4-fold up to eight dilution times. SARS-Urbani

321

NanoLuc virus was mixed with serially diluted antibodies. Antibody-virus complexes

322

were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 1 hr. Following incubation, growth medium was

323

removed and virus-antibody dilution complexes were added to the cells in duplicate.

324

Virus-only and cell-only controls were included in each neutralization assay plate.

325

Following infection, plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours. After the 48-

326

hour incubation, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using the Nano-

327

Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

328
329

High-throughput mAb quantification. High-throughput quantification of micro-scale

330

produced mAbs was performed from CHO culture supernatants or micro-scale purified

331

mAbs in a 96-well plate format using the Cy-Clone Plus Kit and an iQue Plus Screener flow

332

cytometer (IntelliCyt Corp), according to the vendor’s protocol. Purified mAbs were assessed

333

at a single dilution (1:10 final, using 2 μL of purified mAb per reaction), and a control human

334

IgG solution with known concentration was used to generate a calibration curve. Data were

335

analyzed using ForeCyt software version 6.2 (IntelliCyt Corp).

Quantification and statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics mean ± SEM or mean ±

338

SD were determined for continuous variables as noted. Technical and biological replicates
