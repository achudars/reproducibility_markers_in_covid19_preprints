Abstract

21

A new coronavirus was recently discovered and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

22

(SARS-CoV-2). In the absence of specific therapeutic and prophylactic agents, the virus has infected

23

almost hundred million people, of whom nearly two million have died from the viral disease COVID-19.

24

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat requiring new therapeutic strategies. Among them,

25

antiviral studies based on natural molecules are a promising approach. The superfamily of phospholipases

26

A2 (PLA2s) consists of a large number of members that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a

27

specific position. Here we show that secreted PLA2s from the venom of various snakes protect to varying

28

degrees the Vero E6 cells widely used for the replication of viruses with evident cytopathic action, from

29

SARS-CoV-2 infection PLA2s showed low cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells and the high antiviral activity

30

against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values ranged from 0.06 to 7.71 µg/ml. Dimeric PLA2 HDP-2 from the

31

viper Vipera nikolskii, as well as its catalytic and inhibitory subunits, had potent virucidal (neutralizing)

32

activity against SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of the enzymatic activity of the catalytic subunit of dimeric

33

PLA2 led to a significant decrease in antiviral activity. In addition, dimeric PLA2 inhibited cell-cell fusion

34

mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. These results suggest that snake PLA2s, in particular

35

dimeric ones, are promising candidates for the development of antiviral drugs that target lipid bilayers of

36

the viral envelope and may be good tools to study the interaction of viruses with host cell membranes.

Introduction

41

In December 2019, a rapidly spreading community-acquired pneumonia was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei

42

Province, China) and subsequent studies have shown that this disease is caused by a virus belonging to the

43

coronavirus family, this conclusion soon confirmed by sequencing the full-length genome from samples

44

(bronchoalveolar

45

(https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-2019-

46

ncov-on-11-february-2020) has officially named this disease «COVID-19» (coronavirus disease 2019) and

47

the causative virus was designated as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) by the

48

International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2. As of March 2020, COVID-19 has spread worldwide

49

and WHO has declared a global pandemic 3. At present the total number of infected has reached about 100

50

million of which nearly 2 million have died. The information is available about several vaccines which

51

passed the third stage 4, but there are no drugs with experimentally proven efficacy in the treatment of

52

coronavirus infection, which shows an urgent need for search of drugs against COVID-19.

53

Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses form the Coronaviridae family which includes four genera: α-,

54

β-, γ- and δ-coronaviruses 5. Of the seven known coronaviruses that infect humans, HCoV-229E and

55

HCoV-NL63 belong to α-coronaviruses, while HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV,

56

and SARS-CoV-2 are β -coronaviruses 6. Coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and

57

HCoV-OC43 cause mild disease symptoms similar to the common cold 7. However, MERS-CoV, SARS-

58

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause more severe disease associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress

59

syndrome and «cytokine storm» that can lead to death

60

result of the binding of the spike glycoprotein (S-glycoprotein) to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2)

61

expressed on the surface of the host cells 11, the lung tissues being the main target. Intervention at the stage

62

of adsorption/binding or replication of the virus using therapeutic agents can effectively block viral

63

infection 12,13. The most common symptom of COVID-19 patients is respiratory distress, and most patients

64

admitted to intensive care were unable to breathe on their own. In addition, some COVID-19 patients have

65

also experienced neurological signs such as headache, nausea and vomiting. Increasing data show that

67

nervous system, resulting in neurological complications

68

infection indicates the urgent need for research on new antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2 15,16.

69

Animal venoms, containing a wide range of biologically active compounds of

70

structures, are a rich source of antimicrobial substances 17–21. Consequently, animal toxins have significant

71

pharmacological value and great potential for drug discovery

72

being investigated in preclinical or clinical trials for a variety of therapeutic applications 25–28. Among the

73

snake venom enzymes, phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) are one of the main components

74

PLA2s are small proteins with a molecular weight of ~ 13-15 kDa and belong to the secreted type of

75

enzymes and catalyze hydrolysis at the sn2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to

76

lysophospholipids and free fatty acids

77

The whole PLA2 superfamily is currently subdivided into six types, namely secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s),

78

Ca2+- dependent cytosolic cPLA2, Ca2+- independent cytosolic iPLA2, platelet-activating factor

79

acetylhydrolase PAF-AH, lysosomal LPLA2 and adipose-specific AdPLA2 34. More than one third of the

80

members of the PLA2 superfamily belong to sPLA2, which is further divided into 10 groups and 18

81

subgroups. The PLA2s from snake venoms are in groups I and II

82

Hydrophidae venoms (115-120 amino acid residues and seven disulfide bonds) form the group IA, while

83

those from Crotalidae and Viperidae venoms (120-125 amino acids and seven disulfides) form group IIA.

84

Several PLA2s of group IIA exist as non-covalent dimers formed by enzymatically active subunit and

85

inactive subunit in which Asp residue in the active site is replaced by Gln residue. The examples of such

86

PLA2 dimers are HDP-I and HDP-II from Vipera nikolskii venom 36. In organism, snake venom PLA2s

87

affect different vitally important system, including nervous system 37. It should be noted that endogenous

88

secretory PLA2s play an important role in functioning of the central nervous system in mammals

89

PLA2s from snake venoms and from other sources have shown antiviral activity against Dengue and

90

Yellow fever viruses 39, HIV 40, Adenovirus 41, Rous virus 42 and Newcastle virus 43, demonstrating a great

91

potential of PLA2s as antivirals. It can be expected that PLA2s will have antiviral activity against SARS-

92

CoV-2 and this property can be used in the development of drugs against COVID-19.

93

Taking this into account, we tested several snake venom PLA2s for their antiviral activity against SARS-

94

CoV-2. We have shown that all tested PLA2s are capable to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,

95

however, only dimeric PLA2s have high antiviral activity. Additional studies on the PLA2s against SARS-

96

CoV-2 showed that the virucidal and antiviral activities of dimeric PLA2 depended on its catalytic

97

activity. The ability of PLA2 to inactivate the virus suggests a new protective mechanism for the host cells

98

that could provide an additional barrier to the spread of infection.

Results

100

Preparation of PLA2s

101

In total we studied eight samples of snake venom PLA2s and their subunits. Two PLA2s were from krait

102

Bungarus fasciatus venom: phospholipase A2 II (GenBank AAK62361.1) and basic phospholipase A2 1

103

(UniProtKB Q90WA7), named BF-PLA2-II and BF-PLA2-1, respectively. Both these PLA2s belong to

104

group IA. All other PLA2s tested in this work belong to group IIA: one PLA2, Vur-PL2 (UniProtKB

105

F8QN53) was from viper V. ursinii renardi. Two more PLA2s, HDP-1 and HDP-2, were from viper V.

106

nikolskii. HDP-1 and HDP-2 are non-covalent dimers composed of enzymatically active subunits HDP-1P

107

(UniProtKB Q1RP79) and HDP-2P (UniProtKB Q1RP78), respectively, as well as enzymatically inactive

108

HDP-1I (UniProtKB A4VBF0) which is common for both dimers. By reversed phase chromatography,

109

HDP-2 was separated into HDP-2P and HDP-1I, which were used for further studies. To inactivate HDP-

110

2P, it was treated with 4-bromophenacyl bromide which selectively alkylated His residue in the active site.

111

The modified analogue was purified by reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry, which

112

indicated the increase in mass by 198 Da (yield of the target derivative was 45%). This increase indicates

113

the inclusion of one 4-bromophenacyl residue into HDP-2P molecule. The study of enzymatic activity

114

showed that phospholipolytic activity of modified HDP-2P decreased by about 2200 times. The

115

inactivated protein called “HDP-2P inact” was used for further studies.

116

Antiviral activity of snake venom PLA2s

117

To study the antiviral activity of PLA2s against SARS-CoV-2, five snake venom PLA2 were tested, two

118

of them, HDP-1 and HDP-2, being dimeric. The antiviral activity of two subunits (HDP-1I and HDP-2P)

119

isolated from HDP-2 was tested as well. In this assay, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of live SARS-CoV-2 on

120

Vero E6 cells was studied. Replication of viruses in Vero E6 cell line produces obvious cytopathic effect

121

in vitro, that is why this cell line is widely used in virology. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in

122

morphological changes in cells which included cell rounding, detachment and cytolysis (Fig. 1). We found

123

that all five tested PLA2s showed antiviral activity in an in vitro experimental infection model using live

124

SARS-CoV-2 and Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2): morphological changes induced by the virus were

125

prevented by PLA2s (Fig. 1). Monomeric group IA BF-PLA2-II (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) and BF-PLA2-1

126

(Fig.2) showed low activity, which at the maximum concentration of 100 µg/ml) inhibited SARS-CoV-2

127

infection by an average of about 50% (Fig. 2). Monomeric group IIA Vur-PL2 had an intermediate

128

antiviral activity: it inhibited infection by 50% at ~1 µg/ml (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). However, the two

129

investigated dimeric PLA2s HDP-1 and HDP-2 showed a strong antiviral activity, inhibiting CPE even at

130

a concentration of 0.1 µg/ml (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).

131

Next, we studied the antiviral activity of two isolated subunits of HDP-2. The results revealed striking

132

differences between their actions: the catalytically active subunit HDP-2P showed 2-fold higher antiviral

133

activity than the parent HDP-2, while enzymatically inactive subunit HDP-1I showed two orders of

134

magnitude lower antiviral activity than HDP-2 (Fig. 2). This suggests that antiviral activity may be related

135

to phospholipolytic activity. To determine the contribution of the phospholipase activity of the HDP-2P

136

subunit to the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, the enzymatic activity of this subunit was inhibited by chemical

137

modification of the active site (HDP-2P inact). It was found that after such modification the antiviral

138

activity of HDP-2P decreased 70-fold (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Thus, PLA2s from different snakes showed

139

various antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The abolishment of enzymatic activity resulted in a strong

140

decrease of antiviral activity.

141

Cytotoxic activity of snake venom PLA2s

142

To evaluate the direct effects of PLA2s on the Vero E6 cells, the cytotoxicity of PLA2 was studied: it was

143

found that they slightly slow down cell proliferation, without morphological changes in the cell monolayer

144

(Fig. 3). The highest, albeit moderate, cytotoxicity was manifested by Vur-PL2 and HDP-2P which at 100

6

145

μg/ml reduced cell proliferation on average by 38% and 51%, respectively. Only HDP-2P at the maximal

146

concentration has pronounced cytotoxicity with a change in cell morphology. However, HDP-2P inhibited

147

SARS-CoV-2 CPE at concentration of 0.1 µg/ml, that is at three order of magnitude lower concentration.

148

Dimeric PLA2 HDP-2 and its subunits HDP-2P and HDP-1I possesses potent virucidal activity

149

To elucidate whether the PLA2s exert their antiviral activity through phospholipolytic effects on the cell

150

membrane or on the virus, we analyzed the virucidal activity of the HDP-2 and HDP-2P which manifested

151

the highest antiviral activity as well as of HDP-1I and HDP-2P with the enzymatic activity blocked by

152

chemical modification (HDP-2P inact). To detect a direct inhibitory effect on the viral particles, the

153

SARS-CoV-2 virus stock was treated with various concentrations (0.1–10 µg/ml) of these proteins or

154

buffer. One hour after treatment, the mixtures were diluted 2000-fold and the infectious activity of the

155

virus was determined using serial dilutions method. The results were evaluated after 72 h post infection

156

based on visual scoring of CPE on the Vero E6 cells. Depending on the concentration of HDP-2 and of its

157

subunits, a significant suppression of the infectious viral titer was achieved (Fig. 4). Complete suppression

158

of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when the viral stock was treated with the catalytically

159

active subunit HDP-2P at all tested concentrations. However, as in the experiment on antiviral activity,

160

inhibition of the enzymatic activity of HDP-2P led to a loss in the ability to completely inactivate SARS-

161

CoV-2, which was manifested by an increase in viral titer at lower concentration of HDP-1I or modified

162

HDP-2P.

163

Inhibition of cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S

164

To study cell fusion mediated by S-glycoprotein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, we used 293T cells

165

expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein (293T-GFP-Spike) as well

166

as Vero E6 cells expressing ACE2 which is a receptor for glycoprotein S. The effect of the five snake

167

venom PLA2s on the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion was investigated. After co-

168

cultivation of effector 293T-GFP-Spike cells and target Vero E6 cells at 370C for 2 h in the presence of

169

various concentrations of PLA2s, the number of fused cells, having the size at least 2 times larger than

170

normal cells and multiple nuclei, were counted using a fluorescence microscope. It was found that at

7

171

concentrations from 1 to 100 µg/ml the dimeric HDP-1 and HDP-2 inhibited S-glycoprotein mediated

172

cell-cell fusion. They showed approximately the same concentration-dependent activity inhibiting cell-cell

173

fusion by 70% at 100 µg/ml (Fig. 5). At concentration of 1 µg/ml, this value decreased to about 48%, still

174

manifesting statistically significant difference from control. Vur-PL2 and BF-PLA2-II at a concentration

175

of 100 µg/ml showed insignificant inhibition, while HDP-2P at 100 µg/ml completely blocked the cell-cell

176

fusion.

Discussion

178

Current efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are primarily focused on hygiene, quarantine of

179

infected people, social distancing and vaccine development

180

vaccine and to find an effective medicine by screening different compounds against COVID-19, patients

181

are in urgent need of therapeutic interventions.

182

It has been shown that snake venoms have antibacterial 46, antiparasitic

183

activities. As discussed in Introduction, snake venoms also represent a promising source of compounds

184

against various viruses. Possessing very diverse sequence variations, sPLA2s show functional variation

185

and are involved in a wide range of biological functions and disease initiation through lipid metabolism

186

and signaling 49.

187

In the present study, we have demonstrated that snake sPLA2s have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-

188

2. The highest activity was exhibited by dimeric PLA2s of the group IIA. Strong virucidal activity against

189

SARS-CoV-2 was observed when viral particles were treated with HDP-2 or its subunits, especially with

190

enzymatically active subunit HDP-2P. However, the virucidal and antiviral activity of the HDP-2P was

191

markedly suppressed when the His residue in the active center was modified by 4-bromophenacyl

192

bromide, a specific inhibitor of PLA2s. It is interesting to note that a previous study of PLA2 CM-II

193

isoform isolated from cobra Naja mossambica venom and belonging to the group IA, showed an almost

194

complete lack of virucidal activity against MERS-CoV 50. It should be noted that there are some genetic

195

and structural differences between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV

196

MERS-CoV glycoprotein S (PDB ID: 5X59) and SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein is about 30%. Given these

197

differences, it can be suggested that PLA2 from different groups can affect the viruses in different ways.

198

These distinctions may be explained by the assumption that some PLA2s selectively degrade the lipid

199

bilayers of the viral envelope through hydrolysis of phospholipids, while others are not able to hydrolyze

200

the viral envelop. The results similar to those obtained in this work for virucidal activity were described in

201

previous studies, where it was shown that dimeric PLA2 crotoxin isolated from Crotalus durissus

202

terrificus and its enzymatically active subunit PLA2-CB inactivated Dengue Virus Type 2, Rocio virus,

203

Oropouche virus and Mayaro virus by cleaving the envelope glycerophospholipids that originate from the

membranes of host cells

206

membrane

207

membrane differs from the composition of phospholipids in the plasma membrane, which can explain the

208

difference in the composition of phospholipids in the envelopes of different viruses 58–62. Depending on the

209

origin and, therefore, the composition of the envelope, PLA2s can differently affect the viruses and exert

210

the different virucidal activity. In addition, several studies support the idea that PLA2s belonging to group

211

V and X inhibit adenoviral infection by hydrolysis of the plasma membrane of host cells

212

product of PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, which is part of the membranes, is

213

lysophosphatidylcholine 65,66 which has been shown to inhibit membrane fusion caused by influenza, SIV,

214

Sendai and rabies viruses, blocking viral entry into host cells

215

showed only weak cytotoxicity against Vero E6 cells, which was manifested by a decrease in cell

216

proliferation. It should be noted that we and other researchers have previously observed antiproliferative

217

activity of PLA2s against cancer cells

218

cytotoxic and antiproliferative effect mainly on cancer cells without affecting normal cells

219

considering that PLA2s studied in this work inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations several order of

220

magnitude lower than those affecting normal cells, they can be regarded as potential basis for design of

221

antiviral drugs or as valuable tools for the study of virus interaction with host cells.

222

The envelopes of coronaviruses contain spike glycoproteins S which form a "crown" and mediate the viral

223

entry into the cells. Glycoprotein S is composed of two units (domains): S1, which binds to the ACE2

224

receptor on the surface of host cells, and S2 which mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the cell

225

membrane. In a virus not associated with a cell, the glycoprotein S present on the surface of the SARS-

226

CoV-2 is inactive. However, after binding to the cellular receptor ACE2, target cell proteases activate the

227

glycoprotein S, cleaving site between S1 and S2 and leaving the S2 subunit free to mediate viral fusion

228

and penetration

229

endocytosis, and the other is direct fusion at the cell surface 76,77. We found that dimeric PLA2 HDP-1 and

230

HDP-2 are able to block SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S mediated cell-cell fusion. Thus, we can hypothesize

231

that dimeric PLA2s are capable of blocking viral entry into cells like peptide fusion inhibitors

232

manifesting an additional mechanism of antiviral activity. It should be noted that a number of peptides

233

from scorpion venom have been shown to be active against such retroviruses as HIV/SIV through their

234

ability to bind to the HIV glycoprotein gp120 due to molecular mimicry of the CD4+ receptor. As a result,

235

they block the gp120-CD4 interactions, which are important for the initiation of conformational changes

236

in the viral envelope that trigger virus entry into the host cells

237

glycoprotein S and dimeric PLA2s, we have performed the alignment of the glycoprotein S amino acid

238

sequence with those of HDP-2 and HDP-1. Some similarity between the sequences was observed (Fig. 6).

Interestingly, the amino acid sequences of PLA2s have similarity to the glycoprotein S fragment 413-462,

240

which according to the X-ray structure is involved in interaction with ACE2

241

Lys417, Tyr449 and Tyr453 forming contacts with ACE2 are conserved in PLA2 sequences. Considering

242

this homology, we suggest that dimeric PLA2s may compete with SARS-CoV-2 for binding to ACE2.

243

However, a true mechanism for blocking S-glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion by PLA2s remains to be

244

studied.

245

In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time the antiviral activity of snake PLA2s against SARS-

246

CoV-2. Dimeric HDP-2 and its catalytic subunit showed high virucidal activity, most likely due to the

247

cleavage of glycerophospholipids on the virus envelope, which can lead to the destruction of the lipid

248

bilayer and destabilization of surface glycoproteins in the virus. Summarizing previous and our findings

249

on the ability of snake PLA2s to inactivate various viruses, these results highlight the potential of PLA2s

250

as a natural product for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

Materials and Methods

252

Cells, virus and plasmid

253

Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and 293T (ATCC CRL-3216) cells were grown in complete DMEM medium

254

(Gibco, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, USA), 1× L-Glutamine

255

(PanEco, Russia) and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (PanEco, Russia). All cell lines were tested negative for

256

mycoplasma contamination. SARS-CoV-2 strain hCoV-19/Russia/Moscow_PMVL-4 (GISAID ID:

257

EPI_ISL_470898) was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal swab of COVID-19 patient using the Vero E6

258

cell line. The stocks of SARS-CoV-2 used in the experiments had undergone six passages. Viral titers

259

were determined as TCID50 in confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well microtiter plates. Virus-related work was

260

performed at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility. pUCHR-IRES-GFP plasmid was kindly provided by D.V.

261

Mazurov (Institute of Gene Biology, Moscow, Russia). pVAX-1-S-glucoprotein plasmid encoding a full-

262

length SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (Wuhan) was obtained through Evrogen (Russia).

263

Phospholipases A2

264

Phospholipase A2 II (BF-PLA2-II, GenBank AAK62361.1) and phospholipase A2 1 (BF-PLA2-1,

265

UniProtKB Q90WA7) were purified from krait Bungarus fasciatus venom as described 71. Phospholipase

266

A2 Vur-PL2 (UniProtKB F8QN53) was purified from viper V. ursinii renardi venom as described in 82.

267

Dimeric phospholipases HDP-1 and HDP-2 were isolated from vipera V. nikolskii venom and separated

268

into subunits HDP-1P (UniProtKB Q1RP79), HDP-2P (UniProtKB Q1RP78) and HDP-1I (UniProtKB

269

A4VBF0) as described in 36.

270

Modification of HDP-2P

271

4-Bromophenacyl bromide (Lancaster, England) as 10 mM stock in acetone was added to final

272

concentration of 200 µM to the 20 µM HDP-2P solution in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10

273

mM Na2SO4. The mixture was incubated for 6 h at a room temperature and separated using a Jupiter C18

274

HPLC column (Phenomenex) and acetonitrile gradient from 20 to 50% in 30 min in the presence of 0.1%

278

Cell viability assay

279

Cell viability in the presence of the tested PLA2 was assessed using the MTT (Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-

280

tetrazolium bromide) method as previously described

281

were incubated with different concentrations of the individual PLA2s in 96-well plates for 48 h, followed

282

by the addition of the MTT solution (Sigma, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results

283

were expressed as percentage of cell viability in comparison to the untreated cell controls. Three

284

experiments were performed with two technical replicates.

285

Cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay against SARS-CoV-2

286

Vero E6 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. After 18 h of incubation,

287

100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 were added to the cell monolayer in the absence or presence of various

288

concentrations of PLA2s (10-fold dilutions in a concentration range of 0.001 µg/ml to 100 µg/ml). After

289

72 hours of incubation, differences in cell viability caused by virus-induced CPE were analyzed using

290

MTT method as previously described 85,86. For this, an MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to

291

each well at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After 2 h incubation, medium was aspirated from wells

292

and 150 µl of DMSO was added. Absorbance was measured at 590 nm using SPECTROstar Nano

293

microplate reader (BMG LABTECH). Three independent experiments with triplicate measurements were

294

performed. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA)

295

and the IC50 (concentration of the compound that inhibited 50% of the infection) were calculated via

296

nonlinear regression analysis.

297

Virucidal activity test

298

The SARS-CoV-2 virus stock (1×106 TCID50) was incubated with serial decimal dilutions of PLA2 (0.1-

299

10 µg/ml) for 1 h at 370C. Then, the virus samples treated by PLA2 were diluted below IC50 and titrated on

treated with PBS was used as a control. The plates were incubated at 370С (5% CO2) for 72 hours. The

302

CPE was scored visually under a microscope and the virus titers were calculated by the Reed and Muench

303

method 87.

304

Cell-Cell fusion assay

305

The inhibitory activity of PLA2 on a CoV-2 S-mediated cell–cell fusion was assessed as previously

306

described

307

and plasmid pVAX-1-S-glucoprotein encoding CoV-2 S protein (293T-GFP-Spike). Vero E6 cells (3×104

308

cells per well), expressing ACE2 receptors on the membrane surface, were used as target cells, being

309

incubated in 96-well plates for 18 h. Afterwards, 104 effector cells (293T-GFP-Spike) per well were added

310

in the presence or absence of PLA2 at various concentrations and incubated at 37°C for 2h. The

311

percentage of cell-cell fusion was calculated by counting the fused cells in each well in five random fields

312

using an Olympus (Japan) epifluorescence microscope.

313
