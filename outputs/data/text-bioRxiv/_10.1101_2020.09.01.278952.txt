history as well as our understanding of the process
of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.

ABSTRACT
The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have
been carefully monitored since the COVID-19
pandemic began in December 2019, however,
analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide
polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of
structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in
SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the
GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions
and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus
sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are
artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination
between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four
independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from
the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at
specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions
are also enriched for 5’ and 3’ breakpoints in the
transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent
transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3)
Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots
have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity
and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these
structural variants are both consequences of de
novo recombination events within a host and
artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within
the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in
”arms” of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting
that secondary structure may be a mechanism
for TRS-independent template-switching in SARSCoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into
the relationship between structural variation and
recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our
reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary

INTRODUCTION
Researchers around the world are closely monitoring
the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus that causes
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) and the source of the
2020 global pandemic. By studying the mutational patterns
of viruses, we can better understand the selective pressures
on different regions of the genome, robustness of a vaccine
to future strains of a virus, and geographic dynamics of
transmission.
Most evolutionary analysis begins with constructing a
phylogenetic tree based on observed mutations or variants in
various lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Most of these mutations
are filtered to only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
as structural variants (SVs), particularly deletions, may be
sequencing artifacts of low-quality reads or low-coverage
genomic regions. This particular pipeline of analysis has
two shortcomings. First, it ignores structural variants, despite
their known role in viral evolution(27) and the importance of
considering all types of mutations when building an accurate
phylogenetic tree (20). Secondly, these phylogenetic trees
are typically non-recurrent and do not take into account
the possibility of recombination between viral lineages.
Parallel research has been done to determine whether or not
SARS-CoV-2 lineages have already recombined; however,
the conclusions have been mixed (13, 26, 29). Not only
does the relatively small number of mutations in the SARSCoV-2 evolutionary history make it difficult to identify a
clearly recombined lineage, additionally, the lack of publicly
available raw reads makes it difficult to determine if seemingly
recurrent mutations are due to recombination, site-specific
hypermutability, or systematic sequencing error.
Recombination plays an integral role in the evolution of
RNA viruses, including those implicated in recent epidemics:

a SARS-like coronavirus in bats have recombinant origins
(9, 15), co-circulating and recombinant lineages of MERSCoV were found in dromedary camels (22) and several studies
hypothesize SARS-CoV-2 has a recombinant origin from bat
coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, or both(1, 14, 30, 31).
It is generally accepted that recombination in RNA viruses
is via a copy-choice mechanism by which an RdRp switches
template strands during negative strand synthesis, the first
step of both sub-genomic transcription and full-genome
replication in +ssRNA viruses (Fig. 1)(6, 19, 23). Outside
of known transcription regulatory sites, what causes RdRp
to disassociate and reassociate to a different template strand
mid-transcription or replication is not well understood (25).
An early study suggested that in the absence of natural
selection, RNA virus recombination occurs entirely at random
with respect to genome position (2), and is independent of
RNA secondary structure or sequence. Successive studies have
found secondary RNA structure motifs that lead to RdRp
disassociation and subsequent recombination in RNA viruses
(4, 8, 12, 21).
Using 16,419 GISAID sequences (24), we characterize
over 100 deletions and insertions in the evolutionary history
of SARS-Cov-2 as of early June 2020, and hypothesize
that these indels are the result of imperfect homologous
recombination. We offer four independent pieces of evidence
that suggest this (Fig. 2). (1) We show that the indels in the
consensus GISAID sequences are found in clusters across
the genome. (2) Using long-read transcriptomic data (11),
we show that these clusters correspond to regions of the
genome that have high rates of TRS-independent polymerase
jumping, hypothetically RdRp template-switching hotspots.
(3) We show that these many of the structural variant hotspots
show high rates of heterogeneity in the raw reads, suggesting
that even sequences where the consensus sequence does not
contain the structural variant may be undergoing de novo
recombination at these sites. (4) Finally, we show that many of
these indel clusters are found on ”arms” within the predicted
RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that
global RNA secondary structure may play a role in RdRp
template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

Figure 2. General pipeline of project: using GISAID sequences, we identified
structural variants present in SARS-CoV-2 lineages. We compared the
location of these SVs to regions of discontinuous transcription breakpoints,
computed the heterogeneity of SVs using raw reads, and analyzed the SV
locations with respect to the secondary RNA structure using a simulation of
the folded SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecule.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Access and Preparation
To obtain the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences, we accessed
the GISAID sequences on June 3, 2020. We filtered to highcoverage full length (>29kb) sequences, where less than 20
bases were missing, totalling 16,419 sequences.
To obtain the raw reads, we accessed the NCBI SRA run
browser on June 3, 2020. We found the accession numbers
that corresponded SARS-CoV-2 reads that were full length,
short reads from Illumina sequencing machines, and consisted
of less than 1 billion total base calls (to speed up computation).
We downloaded these using the NCBI’s fastq-dump API.
To compare the regions with enriched numbers of
structural variants to the hypothesized SARS-CoV-2 templateswitching hotspots, we used the deep sequencing longread SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data published by Kim et
al(11). We used the reads from the Vero-infected cells,
filtered to reads that aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(VeroInf24h.viral genome.bam).
Identifying Structural Variants
We used MAFFT10(10) to perform multiple sequence
alignment of the GISAID sequences with NC 045512.2 as the
reference sequence. We locally realigned indel calls that were

synonymous using an in-house python script. The subset of
indels that were present in 2 or more sequences is shown in
(Table ), and the entire set of structural variants found among
these sequences is shown in Table S1.
Comparing with Template-Switching Hotspots in the
Transcriptome
Kim et al (11) identified non-canonical subgenomic RNAs
(sgRNAs) in the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome characterized by
large deletions in the middle of the transcript, presumably a
result of the template-switching mechanism for discontinuous
transcription. From the viral reads collected in the Kim et al
study, we filtered to reads with a deletion of 100 bases or more
relative to the reference genome and computed the locations
of the 3’ and 5’ breakpoints. We compared the breakpoint
hotspots to the location of the indels we identified in the
GISAID sequences (Fig. 3).
Structural Variant Heterogeneity from Raw Reads
We analyzed the indels in the context of the raw reads for two
major reasons. First, we wished to validate that these structural
variants were in fact true insertions or deletions, and not the
result of sequencing error or low-coverage genomic regions.
Secondly, we wished to measure intra-host heterogeneity at
these sites, to determine whether these structural deletions
might be the result of imperfect de novo recombination events
or located in hypermutable regions, or whether they were
inherited from the a viral lineage in the previous host.
We accessed NCBI’s SRA run browser on June 3, 2020 to
download the fastq files for the full genomic sequences of
SARS-CoV-2. We restricted to Illumina reads, as short reads
have smaller error rates than long reads and are less prone to
systematic sequencing types of errors (16). We quality filtered
the reads using fastp (5), with a qualified quality phred cutoff
of 20, an unqualified percent limit of 20, and a required length
of 50. Using NC 045512.2 as the reference, we used bwamem (17) to align reads to the reference genome, following the
standard paired for single-end read pipelines as appropriate.
We marked and removed PCR duplicates using GATK’s
MarkDuplicates. We used lofreq to quality score the indels,
perform local realignment, and compute SV heterogeneity
(28). For each sample, we considered a structural variant call
to be homogeneous if the read depth was >50 and the alternate
allele frequency was >95%. We considered a structural variant
to be heterogeneous if the read depth was ¿50 and the alternate
allele frequency was between 5% and 80%. We used an inhouse python script to visualize the raw read alignment to the
reference genome for a given sample and structural variant loci
as shown in Fig. 5.

SARS-CoV-2 SVs. The datasets used are all publicly
available (or from GISAID), and access methods are
described above.
RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 lineages contain over 100 indels
Ignoring the error-prone and low-coverage 5’ and 3’ ends of
the genome, we found 114 total indels between loci 100 and
29,800 (Table. S1).
Table shows all of the structural variants that were found
in two or more sequences. Of these 40 SVs, all but 12 are
deletions or insertions of multiples of 3-basepairs, and would
not result in a frameshift. Many of the indels that would result
in a frameshift occur downstream from loci 29500, after the
stop codon of the last canonical open reading frame.
Structural variants cluster at SARS-CoV-2
template-switching hotspots
The coronavirus transcriptome is characterized by
discontinuous transcription events. During discontinuous
transcription, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
’jumps’ from a 5’ breakpoint to a 3’ breakpoint. This
discontinuous transcription may occur across a single genome
of a virus or it may involve 2 copies of the RNA genome,
with the RdRp switching from one template (leader) to
another (body) mid-transcription. According to the prevailing
model, leader 5’ breakpoints and body 3’ breakpoints occur
at short motifs called transcription-regulatory sequences
(TRSs) adjacent to open reading frames. In a deep sequencing
study of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, Kim et. al. found
that there were many discontinuous transcription events
not characterized by TRS (known as TRS-L-independent
fusion), with both the 5’ and 3’ breakpoints clustered at
specific regions of the genome. The mechanism behind
TRS-L-independent fusion is not currently well understood.
Several genomic regions that we found to be enriched for
deletions and insertions correspond to the regions the Kim
et al. found to be enriched for 5’ and 3’ breakpoints. In Fig.
3, we note several regions of interest, where the genome was
enriched for indels identified from the GISAID sequences and
where the genome was enriched for either 5’ or 3’ breakpoints.
Structural variants have intra-host heterogeneity

Predicted RNA Secondary Structure
It is presumed that RdRp template switching is responsible
for the discontinuous transcription and recombination in
coronaviruses. While transcription regulatory sites (TRS)
govern some of the leader-to-body fusion sites, little is
known about what mechanisms are behind TRS-independent
transcription and replication. We used RNAfold (18) with the
default parameters, to generate an estimate of the secondary
structure of the reference SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. We

Using the raw reads, we found high rates of intra-host
heterogeneity for the indels. Fig. 4 shows the rates of
heterogeneity for SVs at each loci as computed from the raw
reads. Many of the same regions of the genome enriched for
5’ and 3’ breakpoints in the transcriptome, particularly regions
B, C, D, and F, also have high rates of heterogeneity for small
deletions and insertions within the raw reads. Many indels
have samples with high heterogeneity, but also samples with
high homogeneity for a given structural variant call, as shown

either a recombination or mutation event in a previous host,
resulting in high intra-host homogeneity, or from de novo
recombination within a current host resulting in high intra-host
heterogeneity.

DISCUSSION
We have catalogued over 100 structural variations in the
SARS-CoV-2 genome, a type of mutation that has been largely
ignored thus far in the analysis on SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
history. Via the GISAID consensus sequences, publicly
available raw reads, long-read deep transcriptomic data,
and simulated RNA structure, we show several independent
pieces of evidence that suggest that these indels are artifacts
of recombination, and that SARS-CoV-2 contains several
recombination hotspots.
Interestingly, using sequence-based recombination
detection approaches, previous studies have identified several
of our hypothesized recombination hotspots as recombination
breakpoints in SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.

Lau et al. found evidence of the N and ORF8 proteins of SARS
being acquired from recombination between horseshoe bat
viruses. They identified recombination breakpoints at 20900,
26100, 27128, and 28635(15) - which correspond well to our
SV hotspots D, E, and F. Hom et al. also identified a possible
recombination breakpoint around 21495 in tracing SARS
from a bat coronavirus(9), corresponding to SV-enriched
region D. Lam et al. identified a possible recombination
schema for SARS-CoV-2 from Malayan panglolin viruses
and bat CoVs with breakpoints around 11000, 21000, 23000,
24000(14), which corresponds to C, D, and E SV-enriched
regions. Analysis on the sarbecovirus recombinant origins of
SARS-CoV-2 identified possible recombination breakpoints
at 1684, 3046, 9237, 11885, 21753, 22773 and 24628.(3).
1684 is close to 1605, at which 345 sequences have a 3-bp
deletion. The latter 4 breakpoints fall close to or within
our identified SV-enriched region C, D, and E. We also see
several deletions between 2500-3500 (possibly linked to the
breakpoint hotspot at 3046), though we see no SVs within
500b of 9237.
Globally, regions enriched for SVs and transcriptional
breakpoints appear to fall on ”arms” of the simulated folded
RNA molecule. We hypothesize the because these regions of
the RNA molecule are extensions from the backbone, they are
easily accessible and therefore the RdRp can ”jump” between
homologously aligned replicate molecules. We note that this
is a crude representation of the secondary RNA structure; it
ignores the interactions between genome and nucleocapsid,
uses only the reference sequence and does not capture how
mutations might change the folded RNA structure in different
lineages, ignores psueodknots, and only shows the primary
consensus fold. Taking into account these nuances, it seems
likely the global structure of the full genome would still be
a good estimate, but the local structures (as shown in the

zoomed-in regions in Fig. 6) may not be reliable. Additional
work needs to be done to determine if local sequence or
structural motifs exist that guide RdRp disassociation.
There are several alternative explanations for these highly
enriched regions of structural variation, but we believe that
they are unsupported by the combined evidence in the GISAID
sequences, raw reads, and transcriptome data. First of all,
addressing the obvious possibility of systematic sequencing
or alignment error, we see no signs in the raw read data that
the indels are due to such error types. The indels occur in
many Illumina samples, which are not prone to systematic
sequencing errors, and many samples have nearly 100%
homogeneous calls for a given indel.
Another theory is that perhaps structural variants occur at
hypermutable sites within the genome, and it is either by
chance that they appear to be clustered in several regions, or
selective pressure weeds out structural variations in other areas
of the genome. However, recall that these regions are also
enriched for 5’ and 3’ breakpoints in the transcriptome, which
we calculated by only considering reads with a deletion > 100
basepairs. If these sites are in fact hypermutable, then they
are also hypermutable for larger structural variations as well;
selective pressure would not be acting on the transcriptome in
such a manner. It seems possible, however, that there might
be additional template-switching hotspots that can be seen in
the discontinuous transcriptome, but not in the regions of SV
enrichment because selective pressure makes SARS-CoV-2
unable to handle SVs in this region. For example, there seems

to be enrichment of 5’ end breakpoints in the discontinuous
transcriptome between loci 8000 and 9000, however we found
no SVs in that region (see Fig. 3); perhaps a SV in this region
would result in a dysfunctional phenotype.
Finally, these indels might be the result of RdRp
disassociating and reassociating from one location to another
on the same strand of RNA, rather than from a template strand
to a nascent strand of a viral replicate. This would mean that
these SVs are not created from template switching between
two separate viral strands, but from RdRp disassociating
and reassociating on the same viral strand. This is possible;
however it is likely that if an area is a hotspot for
RdRp jumping within the same strand, it is consequently a
hotspot for RdRp template switching between two different
template strands. Recombination between two or more SARSCoV-2 template strands could be verified experimentally
by measuring recombination rates between mutant viral
lineages, or computationally by finding a patient that has
been co-infected by two different SARS-CoV-2 lineages
with discernible mutations on either side of a recombination
breakpoint. This computational verification may be difficult
as it would require co-infection in a patient, the presence of
both lineages within the same cell, recombination, and the

We emphasize how valuable the raw or aligned reads
are for better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
dynamics. Although the consensus sequences such as those on
GISAID provide some information about mutational patterns

Figure 6. RNA structure was simulated using RNAfold and visualized with VARNA. The zoomed-in subsections of RNA are from the selected regions of both
high SV and discontinuous transcription breakpoint enrichment. Green areas represent regions with an indel. Note that the structures zoomed-in subgenomic
RNAs have been manually refined to avoid overlap of loops for easier visualization.

and evolutionary dynamics, there are several shortcomings
in consensus sequences that raw reads can address. As we
have shown, using raw reads we can quantify site-specific
mutability. An estimate of per-site variation, both for SNPs
and for SVs, is essential for building accurate phylogenetic
trees, which can then be used to trace the spread of SARSCoV-2 and identify recurrent mutations or sites under high
selective pressure. Furthermore, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to
spread and inevitably recombines with either itself in the form
of a different lineage, another coronavirus, or another RNA
molecule, the raw reads with provide a clearer understanding
of recombination patterns than consensus sequencing can.
We therefore urge the scientific community to make
their raw reads publicly available if possible. While there
are possible privacy concerns with human DNA or RNA
contamination in the data, most pipelines that generate a
consensus sequence involve filtering our reads aligning to
the human genome, thereby maintaining privacy and lowering
barriers for open access to the scientific community.
In conclusion, we have catalogued over 100 indels present
in the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history thus far and shown
several independent pieces of evidence that these clusters
of indels indicate recombination hotspots. An improved
understanding of structural variation as well as recombination
in coronaviruses will improve phylogenetic reconstructions
of the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses, and is one step closer to understanding

the outstanding questions surrounding the RdRp templateswitching mechanism in RNA viruses.
