Summary

19

The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused huge

20

number of human deaths. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available for

21

this virus. The viral polymerase is a promising antiviral target. However, the structure of

22

COVID-19 virus polymerase is yet unknown. Here, we describe the near-atomic

23

resolution structure of its core polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit

24

and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV

25

with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and suggests the

26

mechanism for activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies revealed reduced activity of

27

the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of COVID-

28

19 virus as compared to that of SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into

29

RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate a well adaptation of COVID-19

30

virus towards humans with relatively lower body temperatures than the natural bat hosts.

Introduction

33

In the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of pulmonary disease

34

in China (Zhu et al., 2020), which was later officially named “severe acute respiratory syndrome

35

virus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)

36

(Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020). The

37

pneumonia disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by world health

38

organization (WHO). The outbreak has developed into a global pandemic affecting most

39

countries all over the world (Holshue et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). As of April 19th, 2020,

40

more than 2,000,000 human infections have been reported worldwide, including over 160,000

41

deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). The origin of this

42

virus has not been identified, but multiple origins possibly exist based on the recent

43

bioinformatics analysis of the viral isolates from different countries (Andersen et al., 2020;

44

Zhang and Holmes, 2020). So far, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available yet, which

45

poses a great challenge for the treatment and control of the diseases.

46

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, a group of positive-sense RNA

47

viruses with a broad host-spectrum (Vicenzi et al., 2004). Currently, a total of seven human-

48

infecting coronaviruses have been identified, among which SARS-CoV-2 displays the highest

49

similarity in genome sequence to the SARS-CoV emerged in 2002-2003 (Zhong et al., 2003;

50

Zhou et al., 2020). Both viruses utilize the same host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme

51

2 (ACE2) for cell entry and cause respiratory symptoms that may progress to severe pneumonia

52

and lead to death (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). However, as compared to the SARS-CoV,

53

SARS-CoV-2 shows a much higher transmission rate and a lower mortality (Huang et al., 2020;

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.057265; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

54

Wang et al., 2020). Most of the infections result in mild symptoms and a substantial number of

55

asymptomatic infection cases have also been reported (Rothe et al., 2020). These properties

56

allow the SARS-CoV-2 to transmit among humans furtively, facilitating the quantum-leaps of

57

pandemic expansion. Characterizing the infection and replication behaviors of SARS-CoV-2

58

would provide critical information for understanding its unique pathogenesis and host-adaption

59

properties.

60

The replication of coronavirus is operated by a set of non-structural proteins (nsps)

61

encoded by the open-reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1ab in its genome, which are initially

62

translated as polyproteins followed by proteolysis cleavage for maturation (Ziebuhr, 2005).

63

These proteins assemble into a multi-subunit polymerase complex to mediate the transcription

64

and replication of viral genome. Among them, nsp12 is the catalytic subunit with RNA-

65

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (Ahn et al., 2012). The nsp12 itself is capable of

66

conducting polymerase reaction with extremely low efficiency, whereas the presence of nsp7

67

and nsp8 cofactors remarkably stimulates its polymerase activity (Subissi et al., 2014). The

68

nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 subcomplex is thus defined as the minimal core components for mediating

69

coronavirus RNA synthesis. To achieve the complete transcription and replication of viral

70

genome, several other nsp subunits are required to assemble into a holoenzyme complex,

71

including the nsp10, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp16, for which the precise functions for RNA synthesis

72

have not been well understood (Adedeji et al., 2012; Lehmann et al., 2015; Sevajol et al., 2014;

73

Ziebuhr, 2005). The viral polymerase has shown enormous prospect as a highly potent antiviral

74

drug target due to its higher evolutionary stability, compared to the surface proteins that are

75

more prone to drift as a result of the selection by host immunity (Shi et al., 2013). Therefore,

76

understanding the structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex is an essential

77

prerequisite for developing novel therapeutic agents.

78

In this work, we determined the near-atomic resolution structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-

79

nsp7-nsp8 core polymerase complex by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction,

80

and revealed the reduced polymerase activity and thermostability as compared to its SARS-

81

CoV counterpart. These findings improve our understanding of coronavirus replication and

82

evolution which might contribute to the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 to human hosts.

Results

85

Overall structure of SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase complex

86

The SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors were expressed using the

87

baculovirus and Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression systems, respectively. The three protein

88

subunits were mixed in vitro to constitute the core polymerase complex (Figure S1). The

89

structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex was determined at 3.7 Å resolution, which

90

clearly resolved the main chain trace and most bulky side chains of each subunit (Figures S2

91

and S3). Similar to the counterpart complex of SARS-CoV (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019), the

92

N-terminal ~110 amino acids of nsp12, as well as the N-terminal ~80 residues of nsp8 and a

93

small portion of nsp7 C-terminus, could not be resolved in the density map (Figure 1A). In total,

94

approximately 80% of the 160-kDa complex was interpreted in the structure.

95

The SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex consists of a nsp12 core catalytic subunit bound

96

with a nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer and an additional nsp8 subunit at a different binding site (Figure

97

1B). The N-terminal portion of nsp12 polymerase subunit contains a Nidovirus RdRp-

98

associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain that is shared by all members of the

99

Nidovirales order (Lehmann et al., 2015). This domain binds at the back side of the right-hand

100

configured C-terminal RdRp. Between them is an interface domain that links the NiRAN

101

domain to the fingers subdomain of RdRp (Figure 1B and C). The NiRAN and interface

102

domains represent additional features of coronavirus RdRp as compared to the polymerase

103

subunit of flaviviruses which is also a group of positive-sense RNA viruses (Duan et al., 2017;

104

Godoy et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017). The C-terminal catalytic domain adopts a conserved

105

architecture of all viral RdRps, composed of the fingers, palm and thumb subdomains (Figure

106

1C). A remarkable feature of the coronavirus RdRp is the long finger extension that intersects

107

with the thumb subdomain to form a closed-ring structure (Figure 1C), in contrast to the smaller

108

loop in segmented negative-sense RNA virus (sNSV) polymerases which results in a relatively

109

open conformation, such as influenza virus, bunyavirus and arenavirus polymerases

110

S4) (Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Pflug et al., 2014). Similar close contact between

111

the fingers and thumb subdomains is also observed in the structures of poliovirus (PV) and Zika

112

virus (ZIKV) polymerases (Figure S4) (Godoy et al., 2017; Gong and Peersen, 2010), which

113

might be a common feature of positive-sense RNA virus polymerases.

Structural comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complexes

116

Basically, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex highly resembles that of SARS-

117

CoV, with a global root mean square deviation (RMSD) of ~1 Å for the α-carbon atoms (Figure

118

2A). There are 1, 4 and 25 residue substitutions between the two viruses in the structurally

119

visualized regions of nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 subunits, respectively (Figure 2B) (there are 1 and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.057265; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

120

7 additional site mutations in the unresolved regions of nsp8 and nsp12 subunits, respectively).

121

However, these mutations did not result in obvious structural changes of the polymerase

122

complex. During the review process of this manuscript, two other research groups also reported

123

the high-resolution structure of SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase complex at atomic resolutions,

124

which revealed similar structural features to the SARS-CoV counterpart, consistent with our

125

observations (Gao et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2020). All of the three structures reported by our

126

group and others’ revealed similar structural features, including the partially unresolved N-

127

terminal portion of nsp8 and a small C-terminal tail of nsp7 subunits, and allowed the

128

identification of a previously undefined β-hairpin motif in the N-terminus of nsp12 subunit

129

which binds at the interface between the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain of RdRp

130

(Figure 2C). However, no extra density for this region was observed in the reconstruction of

131

SARS-CoV polymerase complex (Figure 2D), suggesting the different conformation or

132

flexibility of this motif between the two viruses. Of note, in the structure determined by Gao et

133

al., the N-terminal residues 51-117 of nsp12 subunit were clearly resolved to constitute an

134

almost complete NiRAN domain (Gao et al., 2020). In contrast, this region revealed poor

135

density in the reconstructions by our group and Yin et al., suggesting the moderate flexibility

136

of this region (Yin et al., 2020), for which the functional relevance yet remained elusive.

137
138

Conserved catalytic center of nsp12 and interaction with cofactors

139

The catalytic domain of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 subunit is arranged following the typical right-

140

hand configuration shared by all viral RdRps, which includes seven critical catalytic motifs (A-

141

G) (Figure 3). Among them, motifs A-F are highly conserved for all viral RdRps, and the motif

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.057265; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

142

G is defined as a hallmark of primer-dependent RdRp in some positive-sense RNA viruses

143

which interacts the primer strand to initiate RNA synthesis (Figure S4). The motif C contains

144

the critical 759-SDD-761 catalytic residues which reside in a β-turn loop connecting two

145

adjacent strands. The motif F forms a finger-tip that protrudes into the catalytic chamber and

146

interacts with the finger extension loops and the thumb subdomain (Figure 3B). It has been

147

shown that some sNSV polymerases, e.g. influenza virus and bunyavirus polymerases, require

148

the binding of a conserved 5’-RNA hook to activate the activity for RNA synthesis by

149

stabilizing the finger-tip which is otherwise highly flexible in the apo form (Gerlach et al., 2015;

150

Hengrung et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Pflug et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2014). In the structure

151

of coronavirus polymerase, this finger-tip loop is stabilized by the adjacent finger extension

152

loops which are secured by the interactions with nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer (Figure 1B and C). In

153

the absence of this heterodimer, the finger extension loops displayed significant flexibility as

154

observed in the structure of SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp8 subcomplex, which would thus destabilize

155

the finger-tip motif (Figure S4G and H) (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019). These evidences are

156

consistent with the observation that the nsp12 alone shows extremely weak activity for

157

nucleotide polymerization, whereas this activity is remarkably stimulated upon the binding of

158

nsp7-nsp8 cofactors (Ahn et al., 2012; Subissi et al., 2014).

159

The nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer binds above the thumb subdomain of RdRp and sandwiches

160

the finger extension loops in between to stabilize its conformation (Figure 1B). This interaction

161

is mainly mediated by the nsp7 within the heterodimer while the nsp8 (nsp8.1) contributes few

162

contacts with the nsp12 polymerase subunit (Figures 1B and 3D). The other nsp8 (nsp8.2)

163

subunit clamps the top region of the finger subdomain and forms additional interactions with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.057265; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

the interface domain (Figures 1B and 3D). The two nsp8 subunits display significantly different

165

conformations with substantial refolding of the N-terminal extension helix region, which

166

mutually preclude the binding at the other molecular context (Figure 3C). The importance of

167

both cofactor-binding sites has been validated by previous biochemical studies on SARS-CoV

168

polymerase, which revealed their essential roles for stimulating the activity of nsp12

169

polymerase subunit (Subissi et al., 2014).

170

Based on the elongation complex of poliovirus polymerase (Gong and Peersen, 2010), we

171

modeled the RNA template and product strands into the catalytic chamber of SARS-CoV-2

172

nsp12 subunit. This pseudo-elongation intermediate structure reveals the template entrance is

173

supported by the finger extension loops and the finger-tip to guide the 3’-viral RNA (3’-vRNA)

174

achieving the catalytic chamber (Figure 3D). The nucleotide-triphosphate (NTP) substrate

175

enters through a channel at the back side of palm subdomain to reach the active site. The

176

template and product stands form a duplex to exit the polymerase chamber in the front (Figure

177

3D). Since the viral genome and sub-genomic mRNA products are both functional in single-

178

stranded form, it requires further steps assisted by other nsp subunits to separate the duplex for

179

complete transcription and replication processes.

180
181

The reduced activity of SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase complex

182

Given the residue substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV polymerase subunits

183

albeit the high degree overall sequence similarity, we compared the enzymatic behaviors of the

184

viral polymerases aiming to analyze their properties in terms of viral replication. Both sets of

185

core polymerase complex could well mediate primer-dependent RNA elongation reactions

186

templated by the 3’-vRNA. Intriguingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed

187

a much lower efficiency (~35%) for RNA synthesis as compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart

188

(Figure 4A). As all three nsp subunits harbor some residue substitutions between the two

189

viruses, we further conducted cross-combination analysis to evaluate the effects of each subunit

190

on the efficiencies of RNA production. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase

191

subunit, replacement of the nsp7 cofactor subunit with that of SARS-CoV did not result in

192

obvious effect on polymerase activity, whereas the introduction of SARS-CoV nsp8 subunit

193

greatly boosted the activity to ~2.1 times of the homologous combination. Simultaneous

194

replacement of the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors further enhanced the efficiency for RNA synthesis

195

to ~2.2 times of that for the SARS-CoV-2 homologous complex (Figure 4B). Consistent with

196

this observation, the combination of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8 subunits with the SARS-CoV

197

nsp12 polymerase subunit compromised its activity as compared to the native cognate cofactors,

198

among which the nsp8 subunit exhibited a more obvious effect than that for nsp7 (Figure 4C).

199

These evidences suggested that the variations in nsp8 subunit rendered a significantly negative

200

impact on the polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12. The non-significant effect of nsp7

201

on polymerase activity was quite conceivable as only one residue substitution occurred between

202

the two viruses (Figure 2B). In addition, we also compared the polymerase activity of different

203

nsp12 subunits in the same context of nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. Combined with either cofactor sets,

204

the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase showed a lower efficiency (~50%) for RNA synthesis as

205

compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart (Figure 4D). This observation demonstrated that the

206

residue substitutions in nsp12 also contributed to the reduction of its polymerase activity, with

207

similar impact to the variations in the nsp8 cofactor.

208
209

Impacts of amino acid substitutions on the core polymerase subunits

210

Despite that there are amino acid substitutions in all three subunits of the core polymerase

211

complex between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, none of these residues is located at the

212

polymerase active site or the contacting interfaces between adjacent subunits (Figure 2B),

213

suggesting these substitutions do not affect the inter-subunit interactions for assembly of the

214

polymerase complex. To test this hypothesis, we measured the binding kinetics between

215

different subunits of the two viruses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Each

216

interaction pair exhibited similar kinetic features for the two viruses, all with sub-micromolar

217

range affinities (Figure 5A and B). We also tested the cross-binding between subunits of the

218

two viruses, which revealed similar affinities for heterologous pairs as compared to the native

219

homologous interactions (Figure 5C and D).

220

We then compared the thermostability of each component in the polymerase complex of

221

the two viruses (Figure 6). Consistent with the almost identical sequences, the nsp7 of both

222

viruses displayed comparable melting behaviors in the circular dichroism (CD) profiles,

223

demonstrating similar thermostabilities of the two proteins (Figure 6A and D). In contrast, both

224

the nsp8 and nsp12 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 showed lower melting temperature (Tm) values

225

as compared to the corresponding subunits of SARS-CoV, suggesting the poorer

226

thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 6B, C, E and F).

227

Taken together, the residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase subunit and

228

nsp7-nsp8 cofactors compromise the efficiency of RNA synthesis by the core polymerase

229

complex and reduce the thermostability of individual protein subunits as compared to the

230

counterparts of SARS-CoV. These changes may indicate the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-

231

2 towards the human hosts with a relatively lower body temperature than bats which are

232

potentially the natural host of a panel of zoonotic viruses, including both SARS-CoV and

233

SARS-CoV-2 (O'Shea et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020).

234
235

Discussion

236

The structural information of coronavirus polymerase interaction with cofactors suggests a

237

common theme of viral RdRp activation despite being executed by different structural

238

components. The coronavirus polymerase subunit requires multiple cofactors/subunits for

239

complete transcription and replication functions, similar to the related flaviviruses which also

240

harbor a positive-sense RNA genome (Aktepe and Mackenzie, 2018; Sevajol et al., 2014;

241

Ziebuhr, 2005). In contrast, the sNSVs utilize fewer multi-subunit protein components to

242

accomplish similar processes, which could be activated by RNA segments instead of proteins

243

(Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Pflug et al., 2014). As revealed by the coronavirus core

244

polymerase structures, it lacks the essential component for unwinding the template-product

245

hybrid which is required to release the single-strand mRNA and viral genome for protein

246

expression and virion assembly. In the structure of sNSV polymerases, a lid domain is present

247

at the intersection region of template and product exit tunnels to force duplex deformation

248

before leaving the polymerase chamber (Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Reich et al.,

249

2014). The nsp13 subunit has been shown with RNA helicase activity, suggesting its

250

involvement in RNA synthesis at the post-catalytic stage (Adedeji et al., 2012). Further

251

252

Of note, we demonstrate the amino acid substitutions in the polymerase and cofactors of

253

SARS-CoV-2 lead to obviously reduced activity for RNA synthesis as compared to SARS-CoV

254

core polymerase complex. Indeed, these observations are based on partial components of the

255

multiple-subunit holoenzyme for coronavirus replication which also involves proofreading and

256

capping by other nsp subunits, e.g. the nsp10-nsp14 exonuclease subcomplex, nsp13 RNA 5’-

257

triphosphatase, and the nsp14 and nsp16 methyltransferases (Sevajol et al., 2014; Ziebuhr,

258

2005). These steps would also render important determinants for the efficiency and accuracy

259

of RNA synthesis by coronavirus replication machinery. Thus, the collective behavior of

260

SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex in the context of an authentic viral replication cycle still

261

remains an open question to be further explored. On the other hand, the lower thermostability

262

of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase subunits indicate its well adaptation for humans which have a

263

relatively lower body temperature compared to bats, the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-

264

2 (O'Shea et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). Interestingly, we also found that the closely-related

265

bat coronavirus RaTG13 showed an extremely high sequence identity of core polymerase

266

subunits to SARS-CoV-2, in which the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors are strictly identical and the

267

nsp12 catalytic subunit harbors only four residue replacements between the two viruses (Figure

268

S5), suggesting similar enzymatic properties and thermostabilities of their polymerase

269

components. This observation indicated the RaTG13 coronavirus has been well adapted to

270

human hosts in terms of viral replication machinery and might further support the probable bat-

271

origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020).

272

In summary, our structural and biochemical analyses on SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase

273

complex improve our understanding on the mechanisms of RNA synthesis by different viral

mode as the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer exhibited non-uniform conformations in solution (Zhai et

371

once the nsp7 detach from the heterodimer. Both equilibrium binding constant values (KD1 and

STAR Methods

385

Plasmids, bacterial strains and cell lines

386

The nsp12 polymerase subunit of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were cloned into the

387

pFastbac-1 vector and expressed in the High Five insect cell line. The nsp7, nsp8 and nsp7L8

388

fusion protein were incorporated into the pET-21a plasmid and expressed in E. Coli BL21 (DE3)

389

strain.

390
391

Protein expression and purification

392

The codon-optimized sequences of nsp7 and nsp8 were synthesized with N-terminal

393

6×histidine tag and inserted into pET-21a vector for expression in E. coli (Synbio Tec, Suzhou,

394

China). For the nsp7L8 fusion protein, the sequence was also codon-optimized for E. Coli

395

expression system and a 6×histidine linker was introduced between the nsp7 and nsp8 subunits

396

(Genewiz Tec, Suzhou, China). Protein production was induced with 1 mM isopropylthio-

397

galactoside (IPTG) and incubated for 14-16 hours at 16 °C. Bacterial cells were harvested by

398

centrifugations (12,000 rpm, 10 min), resuspended in buffer A (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl,

399

2 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), pH 7.5, and lysed by sonication. Cell debris

400

were removed via centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 1h) and filtration with a 0.22 μm cut-off filter.

401

The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) for initial affinity

402

purification. The target proteins were eluted using buffer A supplemented with 300 mM

403

imidazole. Fractions were pooled and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with

404

a Superdex 200 increase column (GE Healthcare). The final product was concentrated and

405

stored at -80 °C.

For nsp12 proteins, the genes were codon-optimized for Spodoptera frugiperda

407

incorporated into the pFastBac-1 plasmid with a C-terminal thrombin proteolysis site, a 6×

408

histidine and two tandem Strep tags. Proteins were expressed with High Five cells at 27 °C for

409

48 h post infection. Cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended

410

in buffer B (25 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2mM TCEP, pH 7.4. The cell

411

suspension was lysed by sonication and the lysate was clarified using ultracentrifugation

412

(30,000 rpm, 2 h) and filtered with 0.22 μm cut-off members. The resulting supernatant was

413

applied to a StrepTrap column (GE Healthcare) to capture the target proteins. The bound

414

proteins were eluted with buffer B supplemented with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. Target fractions

415

were pooled and subjected to further purification by SEC using a Superdex 200 increase column

416

(GE Healthcare). The final product was concentrated and stored at -80 °C before use.

Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection

419

An aliquot of 3 μL protein solution (0.6 mg/mL) was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifiol

420

1.2/1.3 holey carbon grid and blotted for 2.5 s in a humidity of 100% before plunge-freezing

421

with an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Cryo-samples were screened using an FEI Tecnai TF20 electron

422

microscope and transferred to an FEI Talos Arctica operated at 200 kV for data collection. The

423

microscope was equipped with a post-column Bioquantum energy filter (Gatan) which was

424

used with a slit width of 20 eV. The data was automatically collected using SerialEM software

425

(http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/). Images were recorded with a Gatan K2-summit camera

426

in super-resolution counting mode with a calibrated pixel size of 0.8 Å at the specimen level.

427

Each exposure was performed with a dose rate of 10 e-/pixel/s (approximately 15.6 e-/Å2/s) and

428

lasted for 3.9 s, resulting in an accumulative dose of ~60 e-/Å2 which was fractionated into 30

429

movie-frames. The final defocus range of the dataset was approximately -1.4 to -3.4 μm.

430
431

Image processing

432

The image drift and anisotropic magnification was corrected using MotionCor2 (Zheng et al.,

433

2017). Initial contrast transfer function (CTF) values were estimated with CTFFIND4.1 (Rohou

434

and Grigorieff, 2015) at the micrograph level. Images with an estimated resolution limit worse

435

than 5 Å were discarded. Particles were automatically picked with RELION-3.0 (Zivanov et al.,

436

2018) following the standard protocol. In total, approximately 1,860,000 particles were picked

437

from ~4,200 micrographs. After 3 rounds of extensive 2D classification, ~924,000 particles

438

were selected for 3D classification with the density map of SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8

439

complex (EMDB-0520) as the reference which was low-pass filtered to 60 Å resolution. After

440

two rounds of 3D classification, a clean subset of ~101,000 particles was identified, which

441

displayed clear features of secondary structural elements. These particles were subjected to 3D

442

refinement supplemented with per-particle CTF refinement and dose-weighting, which led to a

443

reconstruction of 3.65 Å resolution estimated by the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation

444

(FSC) 0.143 cut-off value. The local resolution distribution of the final density map was

445

calculated with ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014).

447

Model building and refinement

448

The structure of SARS-CoV nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex (PDB ID: 6NUR) was rigidly docked

449

into the density map using CHIMERA (Pettersen et al., 2004). The model was manually

450

corrected for local fit in COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) and the sequence register was corrected

451

based on alignment. The initial model was refined in real space using PHENIX (Adams et al.,

452

2010) with the secondary structural restraints and Ramachandran restrains applied. The model

453

was further adjusted and refined iteratively for several rounds aided by the stereochemical

454

quality assessment using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010). The representative density and atomic

455

models are shown in Figure. S3. The statistics for image processing and model refinement are

456

summarized in the Table S1. Structural figures were rendered by either CHIMERA (Pettersen

457

et al., 2004) or PyMOL (https://pymol.org/).

In vitro polymerase activity assay

460

The activity of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex was tested as previously described for

461

SARS-CoV nsp12 with slight modifications. Briefly, a 40-nt template RNA (5’-

462

CUAUCCCCAUGUGAUUUUAAUAGCUUCUUAGGAGAAUGAC-3’,

463

corresponding to the 3’end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was annealed to a complementary 20-

464

nt primer containing a 5’-fluorescein label (5’FAM- GUCAUUCUCCUAAGAAGCUA-3’,

465

Takara). To perform the primer extension assay, 1 μM nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 were incubated for

466

30 min at 30 °C with 1 μM annealed RNA and 0.5 mM NTP in a reaction buffer containing 10

467

mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM KCl, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol and 2 mM MgCl2 (freshly

468

added prior usage). The products were denatured by boiling (100 °C, 10 min) in the presence

469

of formamide and separated by 20% PAGE containing 9 M urea run with 0.5×TBE buffer.

470

Images were taken using a Vilber Fusion system and analyzed with the Image J software.

472

SPR assay

473

The affinities between nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 or nsp7L8 proteins were measured at room

474

temperature (r.t.) using a Biacore 8K system with CM5 chips (GE Healthcare). The nsp12

475

protein was immobilized on the chip with a concentration of 100 μg/mL (diluted by 0.1 mM

476

NaAc, pH 4.0), and the nsp7 protein was immobilized with a concentration of 50 μg/mL (diluted

477

by 0.1 mM NaAc, pH 4.5). For all measurements, the same running buffer was used which

478

consists of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl and 0.005% tween-20. Proteins were pre-

479

exchanged into the running buffer by SEC prior to loading to the system. A blank channel of

480

the chip was used as the negative control. Serially diluted protein solutions were then flowed

481

through the chip surface. The Multi-cycle binding kinetics was analyzed with the Biacore 8K

482

Evaluation Software (version1.1.1.7442) and fitted with a two-state reaction binding model (for

483

ligand nsp8) or heterogeneous ligand binding model (for ligand nsp7L8).

484
485

Circular dichroism (CD) measurement

486

The thermostability of nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 were tested by measuring the CD spectra of each

487

protein at different temperatures. The multi-wavelength (215-260 nm) CD spectra of each

488

protein were recorded with a Chirascan spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) using a

489

thermostatically controlled cuvette at rising temperatures from 25 to 99 °C with 0.5 °C intervals

490

and an elevating rate of 1 °C/min. The data was analyzed using Global3 software and the Tm

491

values were calculated for each sample.
