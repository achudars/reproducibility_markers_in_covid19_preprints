Abstract (205 words)

15

Several studies have reported the presence of pre-existing humoral or cell-mediated cross-reactivity to

16

SARS-CoV-2 peptides in healthy individuals unexposed to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the current

17

literature suggests that this pre-existing cross-reactivity could, in part, derive from prior exposure to

18

‘common cold’ endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). In this study, we characterised the sequence

19

homology of SARS-CoV-2-derived T-cell epitopes reported in the literature across the entire diversity of

20

the Coronaviridae family. Slightly over half (54.8%) of the tested epitopes did not have noticeable

21

homology to any of the human endemic coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), suggesting prior

22

exposure to these viruses cannot explain the full cross-reactive profiles observed in healthy unexposed

23

individuals. Further, we find that the proportion of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with noticeable

24

sequence homology is extremely well predicted by the phylogenetic distance to SARS-CoV-2 (R2 =

25

96.6%). None of the coronaviruses sequenced to date showed a statistically significant excess of T-cell

26

epitope homology relative to the proportion of expected random matches given the sequence similarity of

27

their core genome to SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our results suggest that the repertoire of cross-reactive

28

epitopes reported in healthy adults cannot be primarily explained by prior exposure to any coronavirus

29

known to date, or any related yet-uncharacterised coronavirus.

Introduction

31

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of a large family of viruses; the

32

Coronaviridae, whose members can infect a wide range of mammals and birds (1). Human coronaviruses

33

were first described in the 1960s (2) with SARS-CoV-2 now the seventh coronavirus known to infect

34

humans; joining the epidemic human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 (3) and MERS-CoV (4) and the four

35

species of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human endemic coronaviruses are associated with

36

mostly mild upper respiratory infections – ‘common colds’ – and include Coronaviridae of the

37

Alphacoronavirus genera 229E and NL63 and members of the Betacoronavirus genera OC43 and HKU1

38

(5) to which MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 also belong. Both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-

39

CoV-2 fall into a subgenus of the Betacoronavirus named the Sarbecovirus (6), with approximately 80%

40

identity at the nucleotide level between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. All human coronaviruses are

41

thought to be zoonotic in origin, though the exact animal reservoirs remain under debate in some cases

42

(7).

43

SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have jumped from a currently unknown animal reservoir into the human

44

population towards the end of 2019 (8) giving rise to the pandemic disease Coronavirus disease 2019

45

(COVID-19). The symptoms associated with COVID-19 range from fully asymptomatic infections and

46

mild disease through to severe respiratory disease with associated morbidity and mortality. Marked

47

disparities exist in individual risk of severe COVID-19 with gender, ethnicity, metabolic health and age

48

all identified as important determinants (9–11). At a between country level, population age structures and

49

heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the variation in infection fatality rates

50

(IFRs) between countries (12). Further important contributors may include climatic variables (e.g.

51

temperature and humidity) and associated seasonal correlates (13–15), the choice of non-pharmaceutical

52

interventions put in place, though with a myriad of other possibly unknown contributing factors.

53

In light of the wide spectrum of symptoms associated to COVID-19, several studies have probed antibody

54

(16–18) or T-cell responses (19–28) in samples from healthy individuals collected prior to the COVID-19

55

pandemic to test for the presence of pre-existing cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these

56

findings provide evidence for a degree of T-cell cross-reactivity in unexposed individuals in multiple

57

regions of the world. While the source of this cross-reactivity is still not well-defined, at least some of the

58

cross-reactive T-cell epitopes are suggested to derive from exposure to the four endemic human

59

coronaviruses (19,22), which are circulating in most parts of the world prior to the COVID-19 pandemic

60

(5), typically in seasonal cycles (29). The relative contribution of each of the four HCoVs to T-cell cross-

61

reactivity patterns observed in unexposed individuals remains unclear. Notably, Peng et al. (25) did not

62

find the presence of cross-reactivity in a cohort of 16 unexposed donors. As such, current evidence

63

suggests that prior exposure to HCoVs may play only a modest role in T-cell cross-reactivity to SARS-

64

CoV-2 in unexposed people.

65

To date, it also remains unclear whether the detected cross-immunity in unexposed individuals translates

66

into differential COVID-19 pathogenesis. The evidence for a mitigating role of recent HCoV infection on

67

COVID-19 susceptibility and symptom severity upon infection remains conflicting (30,31), and HCoV-

68

reactive T-cells in unexposed individuals have been shown to have only low functional avidity (27).

69

Nonetheless there has been speculation that cross-immunity with the ‘common cold’ endemic HCoVs

70

may, in part, explain variation in the COVID-19 case-fatality rate in different parts of the world (32,33)

71

and that the high incidence of common colds in children and adolescents has contributed to their markedly

72

lower risk of severe disease (18). Additionally, the possible unnoticed circulation in the human population

73

of another animal-associated coronavirus, at least in some regions of the world, cannot at this stage be

74

formally ruled out to have contributed to regional heterogeneities in the spread and associated mortality

75

of COVID-19.

76

In this study, we employed a bioinformatics approach to probe the possible sources of pre-existing T-cell

77

immunity in samples from healthy individuals predating the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed sequence

78

conservation over the SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the Coronaviridae, which involved the construction

79

of a core gene family-wide phylogeny of all coronavirus representatives that have been sequenced to date.

80

We subsequently assessed the homology to endemic HCoVs and other members of the Coronaviridae of

81

177 CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes identified in healthy unexposed individuals reported by four independent

82

studies. We find that more than half of the reported epitopes (54.8%) did not have detectable homology

83

to any of the endemic HCoVs. Additionally, none of the sequenced members of the Coronaviridae could

84

explain a higher proportion of reported epitopes than expected by chance, given the phylogenetic

85

similarity of their core genome to SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that prior exposure to coronaviruses

86

does not primarily explain cross-reactivity patterns to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals. Instead,

87

patterns of pre-existing T-cell cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 seem in line with lifelong exposure to a

88

diverse and heterogenous array of primarily microbial antigens. We anticipate that our findings will

89

facilitate further characterisations of the potential sources of pre-existing T-cell immunity.

Results

91

Conservation analysis across the family-wide phylogeny of Coronaviridae

92

To reconstruct the genomic diversity of the entire Coronaviridae family, we extracted a concatenated

93

alignment of core (shared) genes (ORF1ab, S, M, N) from genome assemblies of 2531 coronaviruses and

94

constructed a Maximum Likelihood phylogeny (Fig 1a, Table S1). We then decomposed the SARS-CoV-

95

2 proteome (NC_045512.2) into 15-mer peptide sequences overlapping by 14 amino acids and performed

96

protein BLAST searches to determine the homology to protein sequences translated from each of the 2531

97

coronavirus assemblies isolated from a range of hosts. The proteome-wide homology of 15-mer peptides

98

across the Coronaviridae is represented in Fig. 1b. At a 40% sequence identity cut-off, SARS-CoV-2

99

peptide sequences were highly conserved across the family near the C-terminal end of the ORF1ab

100

polyprotein. Representations of alternative homology thresholds (66% and 80%) provide qualitatively

101

similar patterns (Fig. S1a and Fig. S1b). This region of homology includes the RNA-dependent RNA

102

polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13) which are known regions of high conservation across

103

the coronaviruses, with the former frequently used as a taxonomic marker (34).

Cross-reactivity profiles cannot be completely explained by exposure to endemic HCoVs

122

We analysed the sequence homology of 177 cross-reactive peptides found to elicit T-cell response in

123

published work on four independent cohorts of healthy unexposed people from Singapore (22), the USA

124

(19) and Germany (23,26) to endemic HCoV protein sequences (Figure 2). Notably, we found that 76.3-

125

83.1% of the epitopes could not be explained by homology to any of the four endemic HCoV species

126

individually. In addition, 97 of the 177 epitopes (54.8%) did not have any detectable homology to all the

127

four endemic HCoVs combined (henceforth ‘unexplained’ epitopes). To investigate the potential source

128

of ‘unexplained’ epitopes within the Coronaviridae further, we calculated the proportion of these 97

129

‘unexplained’ epitopes with detectable homology to each remaining virus in our dataset individually

130

(excluding SARS-CoV-2) (Figure S2). The results suggest that a large proportion of ‘unexplained’

peptides to the each of the four endemic HCoVs (first four rows) and across all HCoVs combined (last
row). The proportion of epitopes that cannot be explained by detectable homology to proteins from each
species of HCoV is annotated on the right of the heatmap. Each row and column correspond to a single
genome record and a single peptide, respectively. The fill of each cell provides the maximum sequence
homology of a particular SARS-CoV-2-derived epitope to the proteome of all genome records for each
species. This maximum sequence homology was determined by considering only all viruses isolated from
a human host and with species names including the terms ‘229E’, ‘NL63’, ‘HKU1’ and ‘OC43’.

143
144

Additionally, given the overrepresentation of some species within the dataset, we randomly subset the

145

2531 viral records to include only one representative of each host and viral species. Using the resultant

146

155 records, we found that the proportion of published epitopes with detectable homology to

147

coronaviruses is strongly correlated with the natural logarithm of cophenetic distance between each virus

148

relative to SARS-CoV-2 (Pearson’s r = -0.983, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3a). None of the 155 viruses in this

149

filtered dataset had studentised residuals exceeding three, indicating that no coronaviruses within the

150

dataset have homology to a significantly higher number of epitopes than expected by chance (Figure 3b).

Possible sources for T-cell cross-reactivity beyond coronaviruses

163

To identify possible sources for the T-cell cross-reactivity observed in people unexposed to SARS-CoV-

164

2, we also performed a protein BLAST search for all 177 experimentally validated epitopes against the

165

NCBI non-redundant protein database (excluding the taxon Coronaviridae), storing the first 1000 hits in

166

each case. A fraction of the epitopes (10/177) share partial homology with proteins from a very diverse

167

range of taxa, including viruses, bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes (Table S3). However, the lowest

168

Expect (E) value of the protein BLAST hits, which represents the number of similar hits expected by

169

chance given the size of the database used and the length of the query (36), is 7.5. This suggests that all

the hits shown in Table S3 could be explained by chance alone. Together with the wide diversity of taxa

identified, the results suggest that there is no single candidate for the source(s) of the T-cell cross-reactive

repertoire beyond the Coronaviridae.

Discussion

174

SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T-cells in healthy unexposed individuals have been identified as potentially

175

important contributors to the immunological response to COVID-19. Prior exposure to globally circulating

176

endemic coronaviruses present some of the strongest candidates for eliciting such cross-immunity.

177

Though, the relative contribution of these coronaviruses to the reactive T-cell epitopes identified in

178

multiple cohorts of healthy individuals have been only partially explored. We characterised the amino acid

179

homology of SARS-CoV-2-derived T-cell epitopes reported in COVID-19 unexposed individuals from

180

Singapore (22), the USA (19) and Germany (23,26) against the entire proteome of the Coronaviridae

181

family, including all major mammalian and avian lineages.

182

Following a comprehensive screen, we found that 54.8% of reported T-cell epitopes did not have any

183

detectable homology to the four human endemic coronavirus species (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E)

184

(Figure 2), despite HCoV infections circulating widely in global human populations (5). We note that the

185

highest conservation to confirmed T-cell epitopes tended to be within members of the Sarbecovirus sub-

186

group, which includes SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and a few related species that have been isolated

187

mostly from bats and pangolins but are not known to have been in widespread circulation in humans.

188

However, this homology can be well explained by the phylogenetic affinity of these viral species to SARS-

189

CoV-2 (Figure 3). In addition, we note that the region of high sequence homology across all coronaviruses

190

(nsp12-nsp16) (Figure 1) is not a primary immune target in COVID-19 convalescent patients (CD8+ T-

191

cells). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a heterogenous pattern of cell-mediated immune

192

responses over the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, largely falling outside of the spike protein, not enriched

193

in the terminal end of ORF1ab largely conserved among the coronaviruses, and does not consistently lead

194

to cross-reactivity with endemic HCoVs (37).

195

Our work adds to a growing suite of evidence that prior HCoV infections are not the sole, and possibly

196

not even the main, candidates responsible for cross-reactive T-cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed

197

individuals. We argue that previous studies that presented empirical evidence of T-cell cross-reactivity

198

with HCoV-derived peptides did not take into account the genetic relatedness of endemic HCoVs to

199

SARS-CoV-2, placing an over-emphasis on these viruses as the source of pre-existing T-cell immunity.

200

This opens the question as to what other antigens may have primed the intrinsic cross-reactivity identified

201

(38) in pre-pandemic samples. A sizeable fraction of cross-reactive T-cell epitopes remains unexplained

202

by prior exposure to any known coronavirus in circulation. It feels fairly implausible that the ‘unexplained’

10

203

cross-reactive epitopes are due to prior exposure to a yet undescribed coronavirus. Indeed, such a

204

hypothetical yet-to-be described coronavirus would have needed to be in circulation globally until very

205

recently and then vanished, which seems highly unlikely. Additionally, since we incorporated the whole

206

known genetic diversity of coronaviruses in our analyses, which has been extensively sampled, such an

207

unknown pathogen would have to be phylogenetically unrelated to any coronavirus characterised to date.

208

As such, an unknown coronavirus would be an unlikely candidate for as a source of this ‘unexplained’ T-

209

cell cross-reactivity.

210

Possible alternative agents for the unexplained cross-reactive epitopes may include widespread microbes,

211

or widely administrated vaccines. The tuberculosis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines have been

212

suggested as candidates providing some cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (39,40). However, our

213

screen of all 177 published T-cell epitopes found no homology to any Mycobacterium species (Table S3).

214

As such, BCG vaccination represents a most unlikely contributor to the T-cell cross-reactivity observed.

215

Instead we identify a diverse spread of putative antigens with low detectable homology. The presence of

216

such a broad pre-existing repertoire of CD4+ reactive T-cells in healthy adults has previously been

217

observed in the context of cross-reactivity to HIV and influenza infection, and interpreted as the result of

218

prior exposure to environmental antigens (41) or proteins in the human microbiome (38). It has also been

219

postulated that the cross-reactive profile may take on an increasing role with age and immunological

220

experience (42) which may result in high levels of inter-individual variation based on infection history

221

and HLA type.

222

Admittedly, sequence homology is an indirect proxy for probing the source of T-cell cross-reactivity. Yin

223

and Mariuzza (43) reviewed five putative mechanisms of T-cell cross-reactivity, all of which highlight the

224

complex and diverse molecular interactions of peptide, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T-

225

cell receptors. In particular, molecular mimicry would suggest that conservation of structure can

226

compensate for lower sequence homology (44–46). At the same time, higher sequence homology

227

improves the likelihood that structural or chemical characteristics are conserved. Deconvolving the

228

relationship between sequence homology and cross-reactivity is evidently non-trivial and remains a

229

limitation of our work. Indeed, we do not rule out the possibility that peptides of lower homology from

230

members of the Coronaviridae can result in cross-reactivity. However, we note that the sequence

231

homology analysis of HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 epitopes by Mateus et al. (19) suggests a positive

232

association of sequence homology and the frequency of cross-reactivity, providing an empirical basis for

233

our approach.

234

Our results highlight the importance of considering the wider phylogenetic context of circulating antigens

235

contributing to immunological memory to novel pathogens. The widespread and repeated exposure of

236

global human populations to circulating endemic HCoVs is expected to have left an immunological legacy

237

which might modulate COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, our results suggest that the extensive observed

238

T-cell cross-reactivity is unlikely to have been caused by prior exposure to any known coronavirus in

239

global circulation. It is nonetheless clear that the potential cross-reactive repertoire is widespread and

240

present in cohorts of healthy people from multiple countries around the globe (19–28), even if perhaps at

241

low avidity (27). It remains to be established to what extent such cross-reactivity translates into immunity

242

to SARS-CoV-2, both in terms of susceptibility to infection and symptom severity upon infection.

Methods

244

Data acquisition

245

3300 publicly available complete Coronaviridae assemblies were downloaded from NCBI Virus using

246

the taxid: 1118 together with accompanying metadata on 08/04/2020. Additionally, we downloaded 12

247

bat and pangolin Coronavirus sequences from GISAID (47) (acknowledgements in Table S4). Sequence

248

duplicates were identified and removed from the combined dataset using seqkit rmdup (48) together with

249

those with >10% of sites set to N. Accessions were later retained in the dataset only for those with a

250

reported host of isolation. This resulted in a final dataset of 2533 assemblies with complete metadata with

251

the latter manually cleaned to ensure consistent reporting of host and viral species.

252

Maximum Likelihood phylogeny of Coronaviridae

253

To reconstruct the genomic diversity of the entire Coronaviridae family, we extracted the shared core

254

genes from the representative genome assemblies across all genera. First, open reading frames (ORFs)

255

were identified using the genome annotation tool Prokka v1.14.6 (49). Next, the Roary pipeline v3.11.12

256

(50) was used to cluster all Coronaviridae ORFs at a minimum amino-acid homology threshold of 30%.

257

Sequences for the four genes ORF1ab, S, M and N were each found to cluster in a minimum of 2531

258

assemblies, which were then extracted, concatenated and aligned using MAFFT v7.453 (51). The resulting

259

alignment was trimmed of gaps found in 20% or more isolates and used to build a Maximum Likelihood

260

phylogeny using RAxML v8.2.12 (52) with 1000 bootstraps for node support. We provide the curated

261

metadata of the final 2531 viral records used in our analysis in Table S1.

262

As it was not possible to include an outgroup in the Coronaviridae concatenated-core alignment, an

263

alignment-free analysis was used to identify the most basal genus with which to root the family Maximum

264

Likelihood phylogeny. All RefSeq genome assemblies belonging to the virus order Nidovirales were

265

downloaded, which contained 103 sequences accrsoss the sub-orders Arnidovirineae, Cornidovirineae,

266

Mesnidovirineae, Nanidovirineae, Ronidovirineae and Tornidovirineae. Each assembly contained a

267

ORF1ab CDS annotated ORF, the only gene shared by all members of the Nidovirales (53), which were

268

decomposed into 11-mer sequences using MASH v2.1.1 (54). Based on pairwise Jaccard Distances of

269

matched 11-mers between all ORF1ab sequences, a Neighbour-Joining tree was constructed to assess the

270

genetic relationship between members of the Nidovirales. The genus Deltacoronavirus was identified to

271

be the most basal clade of the Coronaviridae in the wider context of the taxonomic order and was therefore

272

used to force-root the family Maximum Likelihood phylogeny.

Sequence conservation analysis

274

We decomposed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (sequences retrieved from RefSeq; NC_045512.2) into 9394

277

R). In addition, we retrieved the sequences of 177 epitopes found to elicit a response in at least one

278

individual from Singapore (22), the USA (19) and Germany (23,26) from published supplementary tables.

279

The breakdown of the number of epitopes for each T-cell response type is shown in Table S5b. Translated

280

protein sequences of all ORFs from each of the 2531 assemblies were retrieved from Prokka (49) and used

281

to construct a protein BLAST database. Separately, a protein BLAST database was also constructed from

282

the protein annotations associated with the 2531 assemblies, which were downloaded using NCBI Batch

283

Entrez (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez). Subsequently, we used blastp from BLAST+

284

v2.11.0 (55) to determine the sequence similarity of the 15-mer peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome

285

and the 177 published epitopes using the two databases and. The resultant protein BLAST outputs were

286

merged by retaining only the hit with the maximum percentage identity for each assembly and query

287

combination. To maximise the number alignments obtained we set -num_alignments and -evalue

288

parameters to 109 and 2 x 109, respectively. In addition, to optimise the protein BLAST search for short

289

sequences, -task was set to blastp-short. Lastly, only alignments involving the full length of the query

290

sequence were considered by setting -qcov_hsp_perc as 99. This threshold was employed because the

291

query sequences are short and so sequence identity would only be a meaningful measure of homology in

292

alignments given the whole sequence.

293

Proportion of published epitopes and cophenetic distance

294

Using the merged output of the protein BLAST search querying the 177 published epitopes, we analysed

295

the proportion of epitopes that had detectable homology to each virus in a representative filtered dataset

296

of all combinations of unique host and virus species (n = 155). The cophenetic distance of each virus

297

relative to SARS-CoV-2 was calculated using cophenetic.phylo from the ape package v5.3 (56) in R from

298

the Maximum Likelihood tree file. A least squares regression of the proportion of epitopes with detectable

299

homology on the natural logarithm of cophenetic distance was performed using the lm function in R.

Pearson’s correlation of the two variables was calculated using the cor.test function in R. The studentised

302

Non-Coronaviridae protein BLAST

303

To determine if any proteome outside of the Coronaviridae had detectable homology to any of the 177

304

epitopes reported in the literature, we performed a protein BLAST using the online blastp suite

305

(https://tinyurl.com/y22o4t9z) against the non-redundant protein sequence database (accessed 7/12/2020),

306

while excluding sequences associated with the Coronaviridae (taxid: 11118). Protein BLAST searches

307

were conducted in eight batches of 20 and a ninth batch of 17 epitopes with the number of alignments

308

performed set to 1000 per batch. After merging the outputs of the eight batches, we filtered the resultant

309

table to exclude missing organism names, hits with descriptions containing the terms ‘synthetic’, ‘SARS’,

310

‘coronavirus’, or ‘cov’, or organism names labelled as ‘uncultured bacterium’. Additionally, we excluded

311

hits to the accession 6ZGH_A, which contains a region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence.
