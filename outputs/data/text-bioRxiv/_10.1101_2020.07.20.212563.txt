Abstract
The COVID19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has severely affected most countries
of the world including Bangladesh. We conducted comparative analysis of publicly available
whole-genome sequences of 64 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh and 371 isolates from
another 27 countries to predict possible transmission routes of COVID19 to Bangladesh and
genomic variations among the viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pathogen was
imported in Bangladesh from multiple countries. The viruses found in the southern district of
Chattogram were closely related to strains from Saudi Arabia whereas those in Dhaka were
similar to that of United Kingdom and France. The 64 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from
Bangladesh belonged to three clusters. Compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 sequence
reported from China, the isolates in Bangladesh had a total of 180 mutations in the coding
region of the genome, and 110 of these were missense. Among these, 99 missense mutations
(90%) were predicted to destabilize protein structures. Remarkably, a mutation that leads to
an I300F change in the nsp2 protein and a mutation leading to D614G change in the spike
protein were prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, and might have influenced the
epidemiological properties of the virus in Bangladesh.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID19, Bangladesh, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 Variants.

Introduction.
The pandemic of coronavirus disease referred to as COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in
Wuhan, China in December 2019 is ongoing and has now spread to 213 countries and
territories. As of July 2020, the pandemic has caused about 16 million cases and over half a
million death. This novel virus of the Coronaviridae family and Betacoronavirus genus (1, 2)
designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the
causative agent of COVID-19. Previously two other coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV have demonstrated high pathogenicity and caused epidemic with mortality rate
~10% and ~34% respectively affecting more than 25 countries each time (3–5). However,
SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be highly infectious and caused pandemic spread to over 213
countries and territories. Besides its devastating impact in North America and Europe, the
disease is now rapidly spreading in South America including Brazil, and in South Asian
countries particularly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (6).
The virus was first detected in Bangladesh in March 2020 (7). Although infections remained
low until the end of March it began to rise steeply in April. By the end of June, new cases in
Bangladesh grew to nearly 150,000 and the rate of detection of cases compared to the total
number of samples tested increased to about 22% which was highest in Asia (6).
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of nearly
30kb. The 5' end of the genome codes for a polyprotein which is further cleaved to viral nonstructural proteins whereas the 3' end encodes for structural proteins of the virus including
surface glycoproteins spike (S), membrane protein (M), envelop protein (E) and nucleocapsid
protein (N) (8). Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is also inherently prone to mutations
due to high recombination frequency resulting in genomic diversity (9–11). Due to the rapid
evolution of the virus, development of vaccines and therapies may be challenging. To monitor
the emergence of diversity, it is important to conduct comparative genomics of viruses
isolated over time and in various geographical locations. Comparative analysis of genome
sequences of various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 would allow to identify and characterize the
variable and conserved regions of the genome and this knowledge may be useful for
developing effective vaccines, as well as in molecular epidemiological tracking. Thousands
of SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes have been sequenced and submitted in public databases for
further study. This include 66 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences submitted from Bangladesh
in the Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database, till 11th June 2020
(12). We conducted comparative analysis of publicly available genome sequences of SARSCoV-2 from 27 countries to predict the origin of viruses in Bangladesh by studying a time-

resolved phylogenetic relationship. Later, we analyzed the variants present in different
isolates of Bangladesh to understand the pattern of mutations in relation to the ancestral
Wuhan strain, find unique mutations, and possible effect of these mutations on the stability of
encoded proteins, and selection pressure on genes.

Materials and methods
A total of 435 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 including 64 sequences isolated in
Bangladesh (detail information in S1 Table), and that of 5 isolates of each month between
January to May, 2020 isolated in 27 different countries with high frequency of infection were
included in this analysis. Source and number of sequence are presented in Table 1 (detail
information are provided in S2 Table). However, since only number of sequences were
reported from different African countries, we included all sequences from the African
countries and categorized collectively as African sequence (12). Reference sequence included
in various analysis was the sequence of the ancestral strain from Wuhan, China
(NC_045512.2) (13).

Selected sequences were annotated by Viral Annotation Pipeline and iDentification (VAPiD)
tool (14), and multiple sequence alignment was carried out using Mafft algorithm (15).
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed with IQ-TREE (16), the generated
tree was reconstructed based on time-calibration by TreeTime (17), and visualized on iTOL
server (18). For analysis of mutations, sequence were mapped with minimap2 (19), and
variants were detected using SAMtools (20) and snp-sites (21). A haplotype network was
generated based on mutations in genome using PopArt (22). Sequences were then put into
different clades based on specific mutations proposed in GISAID (23) and further classified
as D614G type (24, 25). Subsequently, another phylogenetic tree and haplotype network
containing only SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladeshi was constructed and categorized
using the same tools, and additionally one step further clustered with TreeCluster (26). The
direction of selection in sequences from Bangladesh was calculated by the SLAC algorithm
(27) in the Datamonkey server (28). Finally, the effects of the mutations on protein stability
were predicted using DeepDDG (29).

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences
A total of 435 Genomic Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 reported from various countries (Table 1)
which included 64 sequences from Bangladesh and the sequence of the ancestral SARS-CoV2 isolated in Wuhan, China were analyzed in the time-resolved phylogenetic tree. Sequences
from Bangladesh belonged to three different clusters of which one cluster carried 43 of the 64
sequences, and shared the same node with sequence from Germany while they had a common
ancestry with isolates from the United Kingdom (Fig 1). The remaining two clusters of
SARS-CoV-2 sequences contained 4 and 5 sequences respectively from Bangladesh, and they
shared the same node with sequence of SARS-CoV-2 reported from India, and also shared a
common ancestry with isolates from Saudi Arabia. Besides, 12 lone sequences that did not
belong to any of these clusters were found to have similarity with sequences from Europe
including United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia. One of these sequences was
closely related to sequence reported from the USA. Subsequently, all SARS-CoV-2 sequences
from representative countries were clustered based on some specific mutations sustained, into
7 different clades as mentioned by GISAID. In this analysis, the sequences from Bangladesh
were found to be distributed in all clades except V (Figs 1 and 2).

Phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh
In order to understand the evolutionary relationship and possible transmission dynamics of
SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh at a higher resolution, another time-resolved phylogenetic tree
carrying only sequences of the pathogen isolated in various regions of Bangladesh was
generated using the sequence of the first SARS-CoV-2 reported from Yuhan, China as a
reference. Of the three clusters produced in this analysis, cluster-1 included mostly isolates
from Chattogram and one isolate from Dhaka, cluster-2 included isolates from Dhaka,
Narayanganj and Chattogram districts, whereas cluster-3 included isolates from Chattogram
only. As mentioned above, the isolates from Bangladesh were found to be distributed in all 7
GISAID clades based on specific mutations, except in clade V (Fig 2). Most isolates of
Dhaka and Narayanganj (47 of 52) belonged to the GR clade, whereas those of Chattogram
belonged to five different GSID clades (G, GH, GR, O, and S).

The major international airport in Bangladesh is situated in the capital city Dhaka, whereas
the major seaport is located in Chattogram. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, all isolates of
Dhaka were the descendant of SARS-CoV-2 found in European countries, more specifically
France and the United Kingdom. On the other hand, most isolates of Chattogram were found
closely related to Saudi Arabian isolates. Moreover, considering the GSID clades, the
presence of S clade was absent among Dhaka whereas most isolates of Chattogram was found
to belong to the S clade. Clearly these two genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 were initially
imported by travelers from different countries, and the two variants initially spread in the two
areas. That the isolates of Narayanganj and two isolates of Dhaka are closely related,
indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain imported initially through international traveler to
Dhaka later spread to Narayanganj, which is a densely populated city with river ports and
large business centres.

D614G mutations in spike protein
The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were also categorized according to D614G type mutation (Fig
1). This particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position
of the Spike protein is presumed to have rapidly outcompeted other preexisting subtypes,
including the ancestral strain. The D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease
(Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein (25). All but one
sequence from Dhaka and Narayanganj were found to be of G type which carries Glycine at
position 614 whereas sequences of Chattogram carry sequences of both types (Fig 2). In
addition, the first sequence from Bangladesh carried G614 type of surface glycoprotein,
which indicate that this dominant variant was present since the first isolation of SARS-CoV-2
in Bangladesh and the mutant virus might have been imported to the country from Europe,
and the presence of the mutation might have facilitated viral transmission.

Haplotype analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
Relationships among DNA sequences within a population are often studied by constructing
and visualizing a haplotype network. We constructed a haplotype network by the Median
Joining algorithm and found that 338 of 434 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from representative
countries were alike, therefore formed a large haplo group (Fig 3A). However, there were
presences of a significant number of unique lineages too consisting of a single or multiple
SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Fig 3A). This network demonstrated the closeness of the sequences
and their pattern of mutation beyond the geographical boundary. Several SARS-CoV-2

isolates appeared to have sustained certain common mutations along with certain unique
mutations. Although a large proportion of sequences from Bangladesh belonged to the
common cluster (Fig 3A), there was a significant number of unique nodes as well due to
mutations overtime subsequent to being carried into Bangladesh (Fig 3A). Therefore analysis
of the sequences from Bangladesh provided further insight of their mutation patterns. The
haplotype network revealed that viruses isolated in Bangladesh had certain unique mutations
in them, and as a result they belonged to different haplo groups and no significant cig group
(Fig. 3A). Most of the isolates sustained a significant number of mutations compared with
each other. In addition it further confirms that most isolates from Chattogram (Fig 3B) were
not directly related to those isolated in Dhaka or Narayanganj.

Location and predicted effects of the mutations
We detected the presence of 209 point mutations in 64 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from
Bangladesh when compared to the reference sequence from Yuhan, China. In addition, 19
isolates were found to have lost significant portions of their genome, and as a result lost

sequences for some non-structural proteins such as ORF7 and ORF8 while other deletions
were upstream or downstream gene variants (S3 Table). Among the point mutations, 29
mutations were in the non-coding region of the genome and 180 were in coding regions. Ten
of the 29 non-coding mutations were in upstream non-coding region and rest was in
downstream non-coding region of the genome. Seventy mutations in the coding region were
synonymous and 110 mutations predicted substituted amino acids. Among twelve predicted
ORFs, ORF1ab which comprises approximately 67% of the genome encoding 16
nonstructural proteins had more than 60 percent of the total mutations while gene E encoding
envelope protein and ORF7b were conserved and did not carry any mutation. Though ORF1
harbored the highest number of mutations, mutation density was highest in ORF10
considering ORF lengths. Details and distribution of the mutations are presented in Table 2
and full analysis report is placed in S3 table.

In sequences from Bangladesh, 241C>T and 3037C>T changes were the two most abundant
mutations found in 58 out of 64 isolates, and often found simultaneously (Table 3). Position
241 is located in the non-coding region whereas the mutation in position 3037 was
synonymous. On the other hand, 57 sequences were found to harbor 14408C>T and
23403A>G mutations which altered amino acid Pro>Leu and Asp>Gly respectively, and
these two mutations were found to be present simultaneously as well. In addition, other coevolving mutations found were (241C>T, 3037C>T, 14408C>T, 23403A>G), (28881G>A,
28882G>A, 28883G>C), (8782C>T, 28144T>C), (4444G>T, 8371G>T, 29403A>G). Apart
from highly abundant mutations, several less common and unique mutations were also
present in the sequences analyzed (Table 2, Fig 4).

As a result of continuous mutations genes are seemingly going through natural selection.
ORF6 was predicted to have dN/dS value of 17.8 due to the presence of higher number of
missense than synonymous mutations. This finding indicates that ORF6 is rapidly evolving
and is highly divergent. The ORF6 protein is an accessory protein whose function is yet to be
fully elucidated (30). The ORF7a and Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein had dN/dS values 1.08

and 1.55 respectively which confer their strong evolution to cope up with challenges under
positive selection pressure. ORF10 is predicted to be conversed with dN/dS value 0 while
envelope protein and ORF7b did not harbor any mutation and was conserved. On the other
hand, ORF3a and surface glycoprotein might approach toward positive selection pressure and
evolve but rests of the proteins were under negative selection pressure.

Among 110 missense mutations, 99 were predicted to destabilize the corresponding proteins
while only 11 mutations predictably increase stability. Ten protein stabilizing mutations were
present in ORF1 with 1 mutation in ORF3a. On the other hand, destabilizing mutations were
distributed among most of the ORFs (Table 4). None of the mutations in structural proteins
were predicted to increase stability.

In summary, mutation analysis revealed point mutations as well as deletion of base pairs.
Deletions of the base pairs were associated with missing non-structural proteins and
predictably affected certain viral properties since ORF7a protein is the growth factor of the
coronavirus family, induce apoptosis, and promotes viral encapsulation (31–33) while ORF8
is associated with viral adaptation by playing role in host-virus interaction (34, 35).
Furthermore, we have found that some genes are under positive selection pressure indicating

that the virus is fast-evolving presumably to evade host cell’s innate immunity; which should
be taken into special consideration prior to vaccine development or other treatment strategies.
Finally, a missense mutation at 1163A>T changing the amino acid isoleucine to
phenylalanine in Nsp2 protein was found uniquely among 44 isolates in Bangladesh. Nsp2 is
a methyltransferase like domain that interacts with PHB and PHB2, and modulates the host
cell survival strategy by affecting cellular differentiation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cell
cycle progression to escape from innate immunity (35, 36). This unique and high-frequency
mutation might be a further interest of study, considering death rate against the infection rate
in Bangladesh.
