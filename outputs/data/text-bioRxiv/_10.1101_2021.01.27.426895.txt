Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people since its
beginning in 2019. The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms
adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public
health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the
mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different
lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the
effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping
from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed
genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from
Brazilian samples in 2020. From October, 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes
present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P1, P2 and
B.1.1.33) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated
mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some
insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.

Introduction
The etiological agent of COVID-19, named SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the
Coronaviridae family composed of enveloped positively oriented single-stranded RNA
viruses (Zhu et al., 2020). The first cases of the disease were reported in Wuhan province,
China, in December 2019. Since then the number of infected people has increased
exponentially worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic
on 11 March 2020. As of 24 January, 2021, the number of confirmed cases globally has
scaled up to 99 million, with over 2 million deaths. Brazil is the third country in total number
of confirmed cases, already exceeding 8.8 million infected people and 216,445 deaths
(Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2021).
Nearly 410,000 genomes sequenced by researchers from several countries are
available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (Shu and McCauley,
2017), which is crucial to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology. A
standardized nomenclature was proposed to reflect genetic characteristics and the viral
geographical spread patterns. Two ancestral lineages, A and B, have been described
containing sublineages that are distinguished by different recurrent mutations and
phylogenetic profiles (Rambaut et al., 2020a). More recently special attention has been
directed to the understanding of aspects that might impact the virulence and transmissibility
of SARS-CoV-2 (Korber et al., 2020; Li, 2020; Toyoshima et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020) and
the influence of different mutations in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and
immunotherapies (Andreano et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020).
Some viral lineages have been studied in more detail, mainly those carrying
mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein, since it is the binding site to the human ACE2
(hACE2) receptor, an essential step to invade the host cell. Currently, there are three
lineages of major worldwide concern: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. The former emerged in
England in mid-September 2020 and it is characterized by 14 lineage-specific amino acid
substitutions and has been rapidly spread across the UK and Europe ever since its first

appearance (Rambaut et al., 2020b). Two substitutions present in this lineage deserve
special attention: N501Y in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S1 and P681H near the
polybasic RRAR sequence in the furin-like cleavage region. N501Y is one of the key contact
residues interacting with hACE2 and P681H is one of four residues comprising the insertion
that creates a furin-like cleavage site between S1 and S2, which is not found in
closely-related coronaviruses (Xia et al., 2020). The second lineage probably emerged in
South Africa in August 2020 and harbors three mutations in RBD: K417N, E484K, and
N501Y (Tegally et al., 2020). The most recent lineage is P.1, derived from B.1.1.28, which
was recently identified in returning travelers from Manaus (Amazonas state, Brazil) who
arrived in Japan. It has almost the same three mutations present in RBD as the South
African lineage, except for the substitution in amino acid site 417, where the original lysine
(K) is substituted for a threonine (T), instead of an asparagine (N). Its appearance is likely to
have arisen independently (Faria et al., 2021). In Brazil, the E484K mutation (glutamic acid
to lysine substitution at amino acid 484) also arose independently and was identified in Rio
de Janeiro state (Southeast Brazil) in early-October carried by the P.2 lineage (Voloch et al.,
2020).
Currently, the E484K mutation is found in several viral genomes from Brazil. Due to
its rapid spread, the independent origins and the potential implications in vaccination and
passive immune therapies, E484K has received particular attention ever since. Importantly,
B.1.351, P.1, and P.2 carry this substitution associated with escape from neutralizing
antibodies (Baum et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020). Recently, this
mutation was also identified in a sample from a reinfected patient (Nonaka et al., 2021).
These two events are evidence of the virus’ potential for immune escape.
Moreover, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 also harbor N501Y mutation, which is associated
with enhanced receptor affinity (Starr et al., 2020) and increased infectivity and virulence in a
mouse model (Gu et al., 2020). The presence of E484K and N501Y substitutions in the
same SARS-CoV-2 genome may be particularly relevant for viral evolution. This combination
was shown to induce more conformational changes than the N501Y mutant alone,

potentially altering antibodies' complementarity to this region resulting in the above
mentioned immune escape phenomena (Nelson et al., 2021).
Structural analysis points to E484K as potentially the most crucial mutation so far. It
creates a new site for the amino acid 75 hACE-2 binding. This interaction seems even
stronger than the binding between hACE-2 and the original main site located at position 501
(at RBD and hACE-2 interface) (Nelson et al., 2021). We speculate that the consequent
neutralization escape due to E484K alone or as a part of a larger array of distinct mutations
might act as a common evolutionary solution for several different viral lineages. Due to the
independent origin of two current known lineages harboring E484K in Brazil, we aimed to
describe the mutation patterns of these lineages, investigate phylogenetic relationships and
perform positive selection tests to identify if adaptive evolution has acted as a major
evolutionary force leading to the increase of amino acid variability in the RBD sites.

Results
Comparative Genomic Analyses
Firstly detected in the South African B.1.351 lineage, the S1 protein mutation E484K
is now present in new emerging variants from Brazil. The analysis of genomes containing
E484K, downloaded from the GISAID database, showed a distribution of 169 amino acid
residues corresponding to nonsynonymous mutations and four amino acid residue deletions
in 134 Brazilian samples (Table S1) collected between October and December 2020 (Figure
S1). Regarding synonymous mutations, 217 genome positions had transitions (Figure 1 and
Table S2) and 113 genome positions had associated transversions (Figure 1 and Table S2).
The arising of E484K mutated genomes with at least four different associated mutation
patterns for lineages P.1, P.2, and B.1.1.33 can be seen over time in the aligned genomes
(Figure S1 and Table S1).
B.1.1 defining mutations were widespread in almost all sequences as expected (e. g.
S:D614G, N:R203K, N:G204R, 5’UTR: C241T, and synonymous substitutions in nucleotide
positions C3037T and C14408T) (Figure 1). As B.1.1.28 is the ancestral lineage of P.1 and
P.2, sequences from these three lineages harbor C12053T (Nsp7:L71F) and G25088T
(S:V1176F) mutations. Four sequences classified as B.1.1.33 carry its lineage-defining
mutations (T27299C (ORF6: I33T) and T29148C (N: I292T)), but have also five missense
mutations in ORF1ab and one in ORF7b (E33A). This pattern indicates a new lineage
derived from B.1.1.33, which also possesses the E484K replacement, as P.1 and P.2
sequences. A hallmark of these Brazilian lineages is the presence of multiple
lineage-defining mutations per lineage (Table 1).
The number of genetic changes associated with each E484K Brazilian lineage is
highly diverse. B.1.1.33 (E484K) carries a mean of 19.2 (range: 17-22) mutations
(considering single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion and deletion as a single event) in its
genome, while P.1 possesses on average 30.1 changes (range: 24-33). Despite harboring a
lower number of mutations (mean: 18.5), P.2 genomes have the highest standard deviation

(SD=2.2) and range (15-25) of these lineages. These data suggest that both P.1 and P.2
have been circulating in Brazil for a longer period and might be fastly evolving.
The analysis of the E484K mutated sequence EPI_ISL_832010, early detected in the
municipality of Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, shows a simpler set of nonsynonymous mutations
(n=10) when compared to others. This genome combines all the prevalent substitutions
D614G from spike protein, N:R203K, N:G204R, and Nsp12:P323L, allied to other very
frequent mutations (S:V1176F, N:A119S, N:M234I, Nnp5:L205V, and Nsp7:L71F). The
presence of spike S:D614G, N:R203K, N:G204R, and Nsp12:P323L in all sequenced
E484-containing genomes was observed.
The last samples associated with the recent public health crisis in the state of
Amazonas

showed

an

expressive

increase

in the number of divergences (26

nonsynonymous substitutions and 3 amino acid deletions - Table S1) when compared with
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2). Regarding the lineage-defining
mutations from P.1 lineages, 14 of a total of 19 genomes from the Amazonas monophyletic
group present the spike mutations L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, and R190S. In this way, the
spike protein of P.1 lineages in these Brazilian E484K mutated genomes is characterized by
the presence of a variable number of modified sites, without the fixation of all known
mutations. In fact, the P.1 and P2. clades are part of a larger monophyletic group, separated
from the B.1.1.33 and the reference genome. These results corroborate the clusterization of
these genomes in different lineages (Figure 2 and Figure S2).

B.1.1.33 lineage. There are also those mutations that are not known as lineage markers but
were found in all lineages (n=19) as Nsp3:K977Q, Nsp13:E341D, and NS3:S253P. New
specific single substitutions (S:A27V, N:T16M, N:P151L, N:A267V, Nsp13:T216N, and
Nsp14:P443S) were also evaluated. Specifically, S:A27V is located in the N-terminal
domain.

The B.1.1.33 lineage carrying the E484K mutation were found in São Paulo (n=3)
and Amazonas (n=1), while P.1 sequences were found only in the Amazonas state (n=19).
All other sequences (n=111) belong to P.2 lineage, the most widespread lineage considering
sequenced data available so far. The Northeast region was represented by sequences from
Alagoas (n=2), Paraiba (n=3), and Bahia (n=1). The North region is represented by
Amazonas sequences (n=6). Southeast sequenced 44 P.2 genomes, 36 from Rio de Janeiro
and 8 from São Paulo. Southern Brazil classified 55 genomes as P.2, 5 from Parana and 50
from Rio Grande do Sul, reinforcing its probable dissemination to all regions of Brazil (Figure
3).
The worldwide emergence of E484K began in March 2020, with three sequences
represented first. A significant increase was observed in October (n=86), followed by
successive increases in November (n=366) and December (n=374) (Figure 4A). A similar
trend was observed in Brazil, as E484K was observed in sequences obtained from October
(n=31), November (n=87), and December (n=40). Most importantly, the proportion of
genomes carrying this replacement was 39.7%, 43.9%, and 43.5% from October to
December in comparison to all genomes sequenced from Brazil (Figure 4B). We believe this
apparent slow-growing pattern in Brazil is due to heterogeneous and limited initiatives of
sequencing in the country, and probably this substitution is already widespread through
Brazilian states, as its harbored by three distinct and apparently independent evolving
lineages.

Selection Analysis
In order to obtain a reliable detection of sites submitted to positive/adaptive or
negative/purifying selection, a random set of Brazilian genomes was tested with different
approaches. Regarding individual site models, the Bayesian inference FUBAR (Fast,
Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation) identified eight sites evolving under adaptive
selection (positive selection) in the spike sequence (Table 2), with calculated synonymous

8

and nonsynonymous average rates of 1.227 and 0.857, respectively. For these residues
under adaptive pressure, six are included in known mutation sites of spike protein, including
E484K (L5F, S12F, P26S, D138Y, A688V).
The analysis with the codeml program from the PAML package confirmed all the
positively selected sites predicted by FUBAR, also indicating a highly variable selective
pressure among sites by the M3 vs. M0 (p < 0.001) comparison and positive selection by the
M2 vs. M1 and M8 vs. M8a model comparison (p < 0.05) (Table 3, 4 and 5). The substitution
calculations of M3 model reached a kappa value (ts/tv) of 2.82630 and a site proportion of
93.156% with an estimated omega (ω) value of 0.25424 (negative selection), while 3.536%
of the sites were estimated to ω = 4.90450 (positive selection) (Table 3). The ω estimative
(ω = dN/dS) is a common method to detect positive selection, since it assumes that
synonymous substitutions are neutral and the nonsynonymous are subject to selection.
Consequently, a ω statistically higher than 1 would indicate the action of positive selection or
a relaxed selective constraint, whereas low dN/dS values would mean conservation of the
gene product due to purifying selection (Tennessen, 2008). Additionally to the FUBAR
results, three sites were also considered with ω > 1 (Table 3 and 5): 222, 626 and 1263. Of
these, only site 222 is not related to the E484K-presenting lineages (A626S and P1263L/S
are known). The list of positively selected sites identified by M8 model is available on table
S4.
To avoid the potential missense effects of the function lost by the sequence mutation,
the purifying selection acts as a protective model. The FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood)
approach detected 19 sites under negative selection (Table 6). Three of them (189, 191, and
564) are near residues presenting known nonsynonymous mutations in the E484K mutated
genomes, as S:R190S and S:F565L. The SLAC (Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting)
method identified four sites (55, 856, 943, and 1215), two of which were already predicted by
FEL. The prevalence of negative selection across the spike protein is consistent with the low
genome-wide mutation rate inferred for SARS-CoV-2 (van Dorp et al., 2020).

Discussion
The permanence of a pathogen inside a population host depends on its efficiency in
key processes such as the replication, the scaping of the immune system and the binding to
the cell receptor. Mutations that create an advantageous scenario towards the host response
to infection enhance the pathogen fitness under the natural selection pressure.
Consequently, the host-pathogen coevolution represents an important mechanism to
understand the establishment and the prognostics of pathogenesis, since the infections are
possibly the major selective pressure acting on humans (Sironi et al., 2015). Therefore, the
circulation of low and moderate pathogens provides time for the pathogen adaptations, in
such a way that the modulation of the immunity may possibly promote molecular
convergence in different lineages over the time (Longdon et al., 2014).
The presence of spike S:D614G, N:R203K, N:G204R, and Nsp12:P323L in all
sequenced E484 mutated samples, reaching three different lineages, might suggest that
these lineages show increased viral replication. Considering that E484K enhances escape
from immune system antibodies, these may potentially lead to a viral advantage. The
occurrence of simultaneous mutations as N:R203K and N:G204R is already known in the
SARS-CoV-2 literature. However, the fixation of these mutations, as well as Nsp12:P323L
and D614G in all the E484K evaluated genomes may indicate a novel adaptive relationship
among these modifications resulting in viral evolutionary success.
Even as an independent evolutionary event, the potential fixation of mutations such
as E484K across lineages may indicate active mechanisms of adaptive selection and are
very relevant in planning future therapeutic strategies (for example, newer vaccines and
immunotherapy platforms). The deletion of three amino acids in the second helix of the
transmembrane protein Nsp6 in P.1 genomes may affect the virus-induced cellular
autophagy and the formation of double-membrane vesicles for the viral RNA synthesis
(Benvenuto et al., 2020).

The important role of subsequent stabilization of the flexible NTD by mutations has
been speculated (Laha et al., 2020). Typically, NTD can harbor a larger number of
evolutionary events than RBD, including mutations, insertions and deletions that could act
allosterically altering the binding affinities between RBD and hACE-2 and inducing immune
evasion. It is known that distinct positions may have a linked relationship in the final protein
structure and may display some advantage by acting together to achieve increased stability,
adaptability, viability and/or transmission efficiency (Laha et al., 2020). The potential
causality or influence of the E484K and others substitutions for the effectiveness of
neutralizing antibodies that bind the N-terminal domain of the spike protein (Chi et al., 2020)
remains uncertain.
Concerning the selection analysis, the FUBAR method was the first one to be tested.
According to Murrell (2013), the FUBAR method may have more detection power than
methods like FEL, in particular when positive selection is present but relatively weak. The
analysis

of

the

South

African

clade

V501.V2

(https://observablehq.com/@spond/zav501v2#table1) found some similar results for FUBAR
evaluation, with the detection of adaptive selection at the sites 5 (L5F), 12 (S12F), and 484
(E484K). The residues 155 and 677 are not associated with the E484K-presenting lineages,
however, recent data found evidence of evolutionary convergence of this mutation in at least
six distinct sub-lineages, which could improve proteolytic processing, cell tropism, and
transmissibility (Hodcroft et al., 2021). The amino acid residue 677 is next to the furin-like
cleavage site (678 to 688). Interestingly, some studies suggest that the emergence of the
SARS-CoV-2 in the human species resulted from a five amino acid change in the critical S
glycoprotein binding site (Fam et al., 2020).
To the best of our knowledge, the impact of E484K in different lineages have not
been deeply explored. It was structurally demonstrated that, at least in combination with
K417N and N501Y, the substitution has profound impact in shifting the main site of contact
between viral RBD and hACE-2 residues (Nelson et al., 2021). However, we still do not know
if this holds true for other sets of mutations associated with E484K.

In summary, we have demonstrated widespread dissemination of mutants harboring
E484K replacement in geographically diverse regions in Brazil. This substitution was
disseminated in our country as early as October 2020, although phylodynamics inferences
placed its emergence in July (Voloch et al., 2020). The fact that E484K was found in the
context of different mutations and lineages is suggestive that this particular substitution may
act as a common solution for viral evolution in different genotypes. This hypothesis may be
related to the profound impact of the mutation, which changes a negatively charged amino
acid (glutamic acid) for a positively charged amino acid (lysine). Since this position is present
in a highly flexible loop, it has been proposed that the presence of such mutation could
create a strong ionic interaction between lysine (K) in RBD and amino acid 75 of the hACE-2
receptor shifting the major sites of binding in S1 from positions 497-502 to 484 (Nelson et al.,
2021).
Mutations in RBD could theoretically decrease neutralizing activity of serum of
patients receiving vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 with unknown clinical consequences.
Arguably the effect of E484K could be particularly relevant. In a recent publication, this
mutation was associated with complete abolishment of all neutralizing activity in a high
proportion of convalescent serum tested (Wibmer et al., 2021). When taken together these
growing body of evidence suggest that E484K should be the target of intense virologic
surveillance. Studies testing the activity of serum from vaccinated patients against viruses or
pseudoviruses with the aforementioned substitution should be considered a high public
health priority. Second generation immune therapies and vaccines focusing on more
conserved domains (for instance, in S2 fusion domain) may deserve special attention to
assure continuous therapeutic efficacy.

Methods
Sequencing Data Retrieval
For the graphic evaluation of Brazilian lineages, all genomes available on the GISAID
database until January 18th, 2021, and presenting the E484K mutation were included in the
analysis. Genomes from Brazil and other countries submitted until January 24th, 2021, and
with collected dates between January 1st and December 31st, 2020, were selected. The
counting of genomes containing E484K was performed by the specification of the mutation in
the search fields. The monthly count was defined by the values between the first and the last
day of each month.
Comparative Genomic Analyses
The comparative genomic analysis of the E484K mutated genomes was performed
with all the 134 genomes (Table S1) presenting the E484K mutation for Brazil in GISAID until
January 18th, 2021. For these, a genomic multiple sequence alignment was performed on
the MAFFT web server (Katoh and Standley, 2013) using default options and 1PAM = k/2
scoring matrix. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs)

the best evolutionary model was performed by ModelTest-NG (Darriba et al., 2020), which
identified GTR+I (Generalised time-reversible model + proportion of invariant sites). The tree
was built by Bayesian inference in MrBayes v3.2.7 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) with
the GTR+I model and 5 million generations. The data convergence was evaluated with
Tracer v1.7.1 (Rambaut et al., 2018) and tree visualization was created by FigTree software
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
For the phylogenetic analysis using the spike protein, the multiple sequence
alignment previously obtained was edited and only the spike coding sequences were
maintained. The inference of the evolutionary model and tree construction were performed
according to the described model: ModelTest-NG model selection, MrBayes with GTR+I and
10 million generations.

Selection analysis
In total, 780 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, collected from Brazil samples between
February 1st and December 31st, 2020, available on GISAID, were used for this analysis.
After an initial filtering step of undefined nucleotides in the region of spike protein, with
deletion of genomes with a N ratio >0.01, 589 genomes were selected. The second step of
subsampling, with Augur toolkit (Huddleston et al., 2021) kept 498 genomes (approximately
119 representative genomes per lineage) for the multiple sequence alignment (Table S3).
The genomic multiple sequence alignment was performed by MAFFT (Katoh and Standley,
2013) with default options and 1PAM = k/2 scoring matrix. The selection of the genome
location for the spike protein was performed with the software UGENE (Okonechnikov et al.,
2012), using the ORF coordinates of the NC_045512 reference genome as parameter.
GTR+I was inferred by ModelTest-NG (Darriba et al., 2020) as the best evolutionary model
for the spike sequences. ModelTest-NG also indicated identical sequences, which were
removed resulting in 161 sequences. The Bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed

by MrBayes v3.2.7 using those 161 unique spike selected sequences and 5 million
generations. The data convergence was evaluated with Tracer v1.7.1.
The analysis of sites under positive and negative selection was performed by HyPhy
v2.5.23 (Pond et al., 2005) according to different approaches: (i) FUBAR (Unconstrained
Bayesian AppRoximation) (Murrell et al., 2013), (ii) FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood)
(Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005), and (iii) SLAC (Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting)
(Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005). Finally, the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum
Likelihood) (Yang, 2007) program was used for confirmation of possibly selected sites with
the codeml package. All models were run using the F3x4 option in the PAML program,
where expected codon frequencies were based upon nucleotide frequencies occurring at the
three codon positions. The one-ratio model (M0) assumes one ω ratio for all sites. The
neutral model (M1) presupposes a proportion p0 of conserved sites with ω0 = 0 and p1 = 1 p0 of neutral sites with ω1 = 1, as would occur if almost all non-synonymous substitutions
were either deleterious or neutral. The positive selection model (M2) adds an additional
class of sites with frequency p2 = 1 - p0 - p1 and ω2 is estimated from the data. In the discrete
model (M3), the probabilities (p0, p1 and p2) of each site which was submitted to purifying
selection, neutral selection and positive selection, respectively, and their corresponding w
ratios (ω0, ω1, ω2) are inferred from the data. The beta model (M7) is a null test for positive
selection, assuming a beta distribution with ω between 0 and 1. By last, the beta & ω (M8)
model adds one extra class with the same ratio ω1. The LRTs (Likelihood Ratio Tests) were
tested to investigate whether ω was significantly different from 1 for each pairwise
comparison: M1a vs. M2a, M0 vs. M3, and M7 vs. M8. LRT performs the comparison both
with the constraint of ω=1 and without such constraint: LRT = 2 (ln1 - ln2). These LRT
statistics approximately follow a chi-square distribution and the number of degrees of
freedom is equal to the number of additional parameters in the more complex model. For
rejection of the null hypothesis of neutrality, we considered p ≤ 0.05. Finally, we applied the
Naive Empirical Bayes (NEB) and Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approaches available in the
PAML package to calculate the posterior probability that each site belongs to the positively
