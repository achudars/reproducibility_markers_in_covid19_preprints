Abstract
The coronavirus induced disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide threat to
human lives, and neutralizing antibodies present a great therapeutic potential in
curing affected patients. We purified more than one thousand memory B cells specific
to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD (receptor binding domain) antigens from 11 convalescent
COVID-19 patients, and a total of 729 naturally paired heavy and light chain
fragments were obtained by single B cell cloning technology. Among these, 178
recombinant monoclonal antibodies were tested positive for antigen binding, and the
top 13 binders with Kd below 0.5 nM are all RBD binders. Importantly, all these 13
antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2,
with the best ones showing IC50s around 2-3 nM. We further identified 8 neutralizing
antibodies against authentic virus with IC50s within 10 nM. Among these, 414-1
blocked authentic viral entry at IC50 of 1.75 nM and in combination with 105-38 could
achieve IC50 as low as 0.45 nM. Meanwhile, we also found that 3 antibodies could
cross-react with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Altogether, our study provided a panel
of potent human neutralizing antibodies for COVID19 as therapeutics candidates for
further development.

Introduction
Over the last two decades in 21th century, the outbreaks of several viral infectious
diseases affected millions of people1-7. Among these, 3 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV,
MERS and SARS-CoV-28, have received significant attention especially due to
current outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, and high mortality rates of
the infected individuals. Most patients died due to severe pneumonia and multi-organ
failure4,9. Despite of rare exceptions, such as asymptomatic carriers, exist, it is
generally believed if the infected individuals could not develop effective adaptive
immune responses for viral clearance to prevent sustained infection, there are high
chances for transformation into severe acute respiratory infection. Supporting this
idea, treatment with convalescent plasma to COVID-19 patients showed significant
clinical improvement and decreased viral load within days10. However, the sources of
convalescent plasma are limited and could not be amplified, therefore, effective and
scalable treatments are still urgently needed11.

Owing to recent rapid development of single cell cloning technology, the process of
antibody identification has been much shortened, from years to even less than 1
month. Therefore, full human and humanized neutralizing antibodies represent as
great hopes for a prompt development of therapeutics in treating infectious diseases.
In support of this, cocktail treatment of 3 mixed antibodies recognizing different
epitopes, with one of them able to robustly neutralize, was successfully used in the
curation of a British Ebola patient12,13. Regarding coronaviruses, neutralizing
antibodies against MERS were tested effective in animals14. While SARS-CoV
neutralizing antibodies did not meet human due to lack of patients after the
development. Interestingly one of them, S309, was shown to be able to cross-react
with and neutralize SARS-CoV-215. However, the RBD regions (key targets for viral
neutralization, also see below) only share 74% sequence identity between the two
SARS viruses16, raising concerns about the effectiveness of SARS-CoV neutralizing
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

The spike proteins of coronaviruses play an essential role in viral entry into human
target cells. The S1 region, especially the RBD domain, primes the viral particle to
human cell surface through the interaction with the receptor protein Angiotensin I
Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)17, which then triggers infusion process primarily

mediated by S2 region18. The primary amino acid sequences of the spike proteins of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 76 % identity throughout the full coding regions,
with 79.59 % similarity and 74% identity in RBD domains16,19,20. Structure analyses
revealed high 3D similarity between the spike proteins of the two viruses, and both
trimerize and interact with ACE2 through the RBD domains 21. Importantly, the
interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 was assessed at around 1.2
nM18,22, 4 folds stronger than the SARS-CoV RBD. While this enhanced affinity may
explain a much stronger spreading ability of SARS-CoV-2, it also suggests that
finding potent neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD could also be more
challenging.

While this manuscript was under preparation, identification of multiple human
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies had been reported by a few studies23-27. While
these groups and ours all employed similar approaches and obtained authentic viral
neutralizing antibodies, the performances of these antibodies varied largely in
different assays, e.g. the correlation between binding affinities, pseudoviral and
authentic viral neutralizing abilities. Nevertheless, more human antibodies either
directly neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 or opsonizing free viral particles for rapid immune
clearances are still needed.

Here, we report the identification of 178 S1 and RBD binding full human monoclonal
antibodies from the memory B cells of 11 recently recovered patients. The CDR3
sequences of the vast majority of these antibodies are different, indicating they are
developed from different B cell clones. A total of 13 antibodies showed binding
affinities lower than 0.5 nM and pseudoviral neutralizing abilities. We further identified
8 antibodies showing robust authentic viral neutralizing capabilities. Among these, the
best one, 414-1, showed authentic viral neutralization IC50 at 1.75 nM. Moreover, we
also identified 3 antibodies cross-reacting with SARS-CoV spike protein.

Results
Serological responses and single B cell isolation
We screened 11 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, and identified 9 out of
11 individuals with strong serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and S1
protein (Figure 1 A and 1B), and 7 sera showed neutralization abilities for
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection of HEK293T cells stably expressing human ACE2
(Figure 1B). Therefore, sera from different individuals displayed a wide range of
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in our assays, consistent with a recent
report28.
The RBD domain in the S1 region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the critical region
mediating viral entry through host receptor ACE2. Using recombinant viral antigens,
we then isolated RBD and S1 binding memory B cells for antibody identification using
the PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) from 11 individuals by flow
cytometry-based sorting technology (Figure 1A). Each individual exhibited different
frequencies of viral antigen specific memory B cells (Figure S1 and Table S1).
Sequences encoding antibody heavy (IGH) and light (IGL) chains were amplified from
single B cell complementary DNA samples after reverse transcription and then cloned
through homologous recombination into mammalian expressing vectors29. Overall,
729 naturally paired antibody genes were obtained from the 11 individuals, of which
the No.71 individual failed to give any positive antibody. However, no strong
correlation was found between serological responses and the number of acquired
SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibodies (Figure 1B and Table S1), while we could not rule
out possibilities of certain technical variations being involved. Of note, No.509 blood
sample was obtained at the second day after hospitalization (Table S2), the sera
already showed weak S-specific affinity and pseudoviral neutralizing capacity,
despite that no strong antibodies were obtained from No.509 sample.

Identification and affinity characterization of human monoclonal antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2

All the 729 antibodies were further expressed in HEK293E cells and the supernatants
were tested in ELISA for S1 or RBD binding (Figure 2A and Figure S2). Among these,
178 antibody supernatants were positive for RBD or S1 binding. We then purified all
these antibodies in larger quantities to measure the precise values of Kd (EC50), and
found the values varied broadly, with the most potent one at 57 pM (8.55 pg/µl), and
13 strongest ones having Kd below 0.5 nM (Figure 2B). All the positive clones were
then sequenced. Notably, almost all (98.6%) of the sequences obtained were unique
ones (Figure 2C, left), unlike what were previously reported for HIV-1, influenza and
ZIKV29 . Subsequently, we aligned the CDR3 of heavy chain (CDR3 H) sequences of
all these 13 antibodies and found 11 sequences are different, with the exceptions of
515-1 and 505-5 (Figure 2C, right). Interestingly, 515-1 and 505-5 also shared the
same CDR3L sequences, and they indeed behaved very similarly in the subsequent
tests (see below).
As the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 tends to undergo conformation changes
during storage, we also performed flow cytometry analyses for all 729 purified
antibodies or supernatants for the binding ability of the freshly expressed spike
protein in the membrane bound form using HEK293T cells (Figure 2D). Among these
729 antibodies, 58 were obtained from B cells purified by recombinant RBD domain,
and 671 were from B cells purified by recombinant S1 protein. From the latter, 135
binders were identified, and 21 of them were able to bind S-ECD (S protein
extracellular domain) while showing low or no RBD affinity, tested by ELISA. The
result indicated that RBD regions are the primary antigen inducing antibody
generation and recognition (Figure 2A).
We also found that the results of the flow cytometry and ELISA assays were largely
consist among the top 13 antibodies (Kd < 0.5 nM) detected by ELISA, all 13 were
RBD binders and could recognize SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on cell membrane by
flow cytometry (Figure 2B). However, 4 (namely 413-3, 414-4, 105-28 and 105-41) of
13 less strong antibodies examined by ELISA (Kd between 0.5-20 nM) could not bind
cell membrane S protein (Figure 2E). On the other hand, 2 antibodies 505-17 and
515-15, barely showing ELISA signals displayed strong affinities of S protein
expressing on A549 cell membrane detected by flow cytometry (Figure S3). These

observations indicated that the membrane-bound and soluble recombinant S proteins
might have certain conformation alterations.
Identification of potent neutralizing antibodies by pseudoviral and live viral
infection assays
To identify neutralizing antibodies, we first employed pseudoviral infection assays
using HEK293T-ACE2 cells. From all the antibodies tested, we found a total of 15
pseudoviral neutralizing antibodies. The best 3 antibodies in neutralizing
pseudoviruses are 414-1, 505-3 and 553-63 (Figure 3 A and 3B, IC50 from 2.3 to 3.6
nM), all of which showed strong affinities towards RBD domain (Figure 3A and 3B, Kd
from 0.079 nM to 0.31 nM) and could also robustly block RBD and ACE2 binding
using ELISA (Figure 3C), indicating certain level of correlation between these abilities.
To our surprise, two of the 15 pseudoviral neutralizing antibodies, 413-2 and 505-8,
only bound RBD very weakly in ELISA (Table S3), but were able to strongly recognize
membrane-S protein overexpressing in HEK293T cells (Table S3), indicating there is
an alternative neutralization mechanism of non-RBD binders.
Among the 15 pseudoviral neutralization antibodies, all could bind S protein
expressed in cell membrane detected by flow cytometry analyses. To further validate
these antibodies, we employed two ACE2 competition assays. One assay was to test
the ability in blocking ACE2 and RBD binding using ELISA, and the second assay
was to compete free ACE2 binding to S protein expressing in A549 membrane using
flow cytometry (Figure 3C and Table S3). In order to perform the latter assay, we first
tested various concentrations of soluble PE-labeled ACE2 in labeling 10 thousands of
A549 overexpressing S protein, and found 50 nM ACE2 could label the vast majority
of the cells (Figure S3). Then, we used 0.1, 1 and 10 nM antibodies to compete 50
nM ACE2 for the binding of S on A549 membrane. All 15 pseudoviral neutralizing
antibodies, except for 553-20, could compete ACE2 (Figure S4A). However, the
competition abilities did not show significant correlation with neutralizing abilities. For
instances, 414-1 and 553-63 are the strongest neutralizing antibodies, however, 0.1
nM 553-63 could reach 50% competition against 50 nM ACE2 while 414-1 needed 10
nM (Figure 3C and Figure S4B).

We then performed authentic viral neutralization assay for the best 11 antibodies
using Vero-E6 (Figure 3A), and found a total of 8 antibodies showing IC50 at for below
10 nM. The best one, 414-1, was able to effectively block authentic viral entry at IC50
of 1.75 nM, and when combined with 105-38 the IC50 could further reduced to 0.45
nM (Figure 3D). To note, although 105-38 showed a much weaker neutralizing ability
by itself in pseudoviral assay, but it recognized different epitope as 414-1 (data not
shown), explaining the combinatorial enhancement. We also tested 414-1 expressing
in CHO cells, and found it could achieve ~ 300 mg/L without any optimization
suggesting for great potential in therapeutic development. Subsequently, 414-1 was
also tested in pH 5.0 for affinity maintenance by ELISA (Figure 3D), the results (Kd=
0.31 nM in pH7.4 and Kd= 0.56 nM in pH5.0) showed a good affinity performance in
low pH, indicating less probability in causing ADE. Furthermore, 414-1 was also
tested by BLI, and showed comparable Kd (Figure 3D).

Cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV Spike protein
The spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share 76% and 35% of amino acid identities with
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Therefore, we next tested whether our
antibodies could cross-react with the S proteins of these two other coronaviruses. In
order to do so, we overexpressed the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV in HEK293T, and tested the cross-reactivities by flow cytometry analyses.
After removal of the antibodies showing non-specific binding to HEK293T cells, we
focused on 30 antibodies with robust membrane SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding
abilities (Figure 4A), among them, we found 3 antibodies, 415-5, 415-6 and 515-5,
recognizing SARS-CoV S, but none could recognize MERS-CoV S (Figure 4B). 415-5
and 515-5 shared similar S protein affinities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,
but 415-6 had much lower affinity towards SARS-CoV S (Figure 4C).

Discussion

Within last few weeks, several groups had published a panel of full human
neutralizing antibodies against COVID19

23-27,30.

To date, a total of 28 human

antibodies had been reported to show neutralizing abilities against authentic
SARS-CoV-2, and here we added 11 more to the reservoir. Among these, 20
reported ones showed neutralizing IC50 within 10 nM, a general potency guideline for
potential clinical use, and here we reported 8 new ones.

In our study, in order to provide good therapeutic candidates of monoclonal
antibodies, we have implemented multiple approaches during the triage processes
before authentic viral testing. Our triage approaches included, 1) RBD and S binding
abilities by ELISA; 2) membrane S binding abilities by flow cytometry; 3) ACE2
competition abilities using both ELISA and flow cytometry; 4) pseudoviral
neutralization assay. The best 3 antibodies, 414-1, 505-3 and 553-63, showed
consistent performances in all these assays (Table S3). The other 5 antibodies with
IC50 within 10nM for authentic viral neutralization also showed relatively consistent
performances in most of the assays (Table S3). In general, the 7 of the top 8
neutralizing antibodies showed robust binding abilities in the ELISA assays. The only
one exception is 505-8, however, it functioned well in flow cytometry-based binding
and competition assays (Table S3, column 6-7, also see below), indicating that
binding affinity is a fundamental quality for neutralizing capacity in our study. And we
observed a general increase of neutralizing IC50 values compared to binding affinity
EC50 values. However, compared with other studies mentioned above, we found that
the leading antibodies reported in the studies by Cao et al23 and Yan et al27, showed
great neutralization abilities, IC50s ranging from 0.1 - 1 nM, showed EC50s of 0.8 70 nM. Similarly, a 100-fold enhancement of neutralizing activity compared to the
affinity was also reported by Chi et al for their leading antibodies25. The reason
causing such discrepancy at this point is yet unknown, however, conformation
alterations between recombinant S and RBD protein and their natural forms may be
one possibility, and assay conditions could also vary among different groups.

Among the top 30 antibodies, 24 were obtained from B cells isolated using S1 protein.
We found the majority, 18 of 24, are RBD binders, and two of them, 413-2 and 553-13,

are strong S binders but not RBD binders tested by ELISA (Table S3, last two
columns). These findings indicated that the RBD region is the primary epitope for
immune responses. Similar observations were also reported elsewhere for
SARS-CoV-223,27 as well as SARS-CoV31,32. We also found another 4 antibodies,
505-8, 505-17, 515-5 and 553-18, showed barely any ELISA signals towards both
RBD and S, but could robustly bind freshly expressed S protein in A549 membrane
(Table S3). These included one neutralizing antibody 505-8 mentioned above,
indicating that the recombinant RBD or S protein may differ from the membrane
bound S in terms of 3D conformation. We would have missed these antibodies if we
only had used ELISA for antibody triage. Therefore, future antibody study should
consider multiple approaches for the initial identification and quality control.

It's encouraging to see the increasing numbers of human neutralizing antibodies
against COVID-19. The combination of different clones of potent neutralizing human
monoclonal antibodies recognizing different vulnerable sites of SARS-CoV2 can
prevent the occurrence of mutant escapes when administered clinically. Therefore,
more candidate antibody sequences could greatly facilitate the therapeutic
development in curing COVID-19 patients.

with free ACE2 at 50nM for 30 min at room temperature, then different concentrations
of antibodies were added for 30 min, followed by incubation with PE-labeled goat
anti-human IgG-Fc antibody (1:5000; Abcam) for 30 min and analyzed by flow
cytometry.

For Figure S3, to test S protein expression on cell membrane, recombinant
ACE2-Cter-6XHis labeled by rabbit anti-His-PE antibody in 1.2:1(n:n) ratio was added
to 10 thousand cells expressing S protein. Detection was done similarly as above.

Virus neutralization assay (pseudotyped and authentic)
Coding fragments of SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009724390.1)，SARS-CoV (NP_828851.1)
and MERS (AFS88936.1) Spike proteins were synthesized (GenScript) and cloned
into pcDNA3.1. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS pseudotyped viruses were
produced as previously described33. Briefly, pseudovirus were generated by
co-transfection of 293T cells with pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- backbone and the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein expression plasmid and the supernatants were harvested after 48 hr,
and followed by centrifuge at 2,000 rpm for 5 min and stored in -80 ℃.

The neutralization assay was performed as the following steps. Pseudovirus was
diluted in complete DMEM mixed with or without an equal volume (50 μl) of diluted
serum or antibody and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were then
transferred to 96-well plate seeded with 20,000 293T-ACE2 cells for 12h and
incubated at 37 °C for additional 48 hr. Assays were developed with bright glo
luciferase assay system (Promega), and the relative light units (RLU) were read on a
luminometer (Promega GloMax 96). The titers of neutralizing antibodies and activities
of plasma were calculated as 50 % inhibitory dose (ID50) compared to virus control.

All experiments related to authentic virus were done in BSL-3. Monoclonal antibodies
were incubated with 200 PFU SARS-CoV-2 SH01 at 37 ℃ for 1 hour before added
into VERO E6 cell culture (96-well plate, 4 x 104 cells per well), and the cells were
continued for 48 hr before microscopic analyses for CPE (cytopathic effect).
