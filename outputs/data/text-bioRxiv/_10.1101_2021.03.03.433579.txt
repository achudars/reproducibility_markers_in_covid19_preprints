Abstract

2
3

Background. The prevention of COVID-19 pandemic is highly complicated by the

4

prevalence of asymptomatic and recurrent infection. Many previous immunological

5

studies have focused on symptomatic and convalescent patients, while the immune

6

responses in asymptomatic patients and re-detectable positive cases remain unclear.

7
8

Methods. Here we comprehensively analyzed the peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR)

9

repertoire of 54 COVID-19 patients in different phases, including asymptomatic,

10

symptomatic, convalescent and re-detectable positive cases.

11
12

Results. We found progressed immune responses from asymptomatic to symptomatic

13

phase. Furthermore, the TCR profiles of re-detectable positive cases were highly

14

similar to those of asymptomatic patients, which could predict the risk of recurrent

15

infection.

16
17

Conclusion. Therefore, TCR repertoire surveillance has the potential to strengthen the

18

clinical management and the immunotherapy development for COVID-19.

Introduction

2

As a highly infectious virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

3

(SARS-CoV-2) caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1, 2).

4

Despite the implementation of preventive measures, COVID-19 is spreading worldwide

5

and has affected over 20 million people to date (3). The clinical manifestations of

6

infected patients ranged from asymptomatic condition to severe symptoms (4). And

7

among the COVID ‐ 19 convalescent patients, some tested positive again after

8

discharge (i.e., re-detectable positive) (5).

9

The global efforts to end COVID-19 are complicated by the prevalence of

10

asymptomatic and recurrent infection. Many previous immunological studies have

11

focused on symptomatic and convalescent patients (6-13), while the immune

12

responses in asymptomatic patients and re-detectable positive cases remain unclear

13

(14, 15). Unlike symptomatic patients who can be effectively identified by clinical

14

features, asymptomatic carriers may inadvertently transmit virus to close contacts and

15

reshape the dynamics of infection in population (16, 17). Although most re-detectable

16

positive cases have minor symptoms and hardly disease progression upon

17

re-admission, their potential infectivity and immunological characterization remain

18

undefined (18, 19).

19

The antiviral adaptive immunity is greatly dependent on the activation of T-cells,

20

which can selectively eliminate virus-infected host cells (20). The specificity toward viral

21

antigens is determined by the structure of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (21). Based

22

on the advances in sequencing technologies, the biased TCR repertoire in various

23

infectious diseases has be revealed (22-24). Thus, in-depth study on the TCR

24

characteristics in COVID-19 is critically needed (25, 26).

25

To address the above issues, we conducted a detailed analysis on the peripheral

26

blood samples collected from 54 COVID-19 patients in different phases (including

27

asymptomatic, symptomatic, convalescent and re-detectable positive cases) along with

28

16 healthy donors. By performing high-throughput sequencing, we explored the TCR

29

repertoire associated to the disease trajectories of COVID-19. Our results presented

30

the unique immunological features of asymptomatic patients and re-detectable positive

31

cases, which could provide help for clinical management and therapy development.

Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics

4

A total of 54 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease were enrolled,

5

including 11 asymptomatic (ASY), 19 symptomatic (SYM), 14 convalescent (CON) and

6

10 re-detectable positive (RDP) cases. And 16 healthy donors (HD) were recruited as

7

the control group. As shown in Table 1, no significant difference in age or sex was

8

identified between HD group and any of the patient groups (as measured by two-tailed

9

Mann–Whitney U-test or Fisher’s exact test). Except for one patient with pre-existing

10

chronic pharyngitis, most ASY cases had no obvious clinical symptoms during the

11

whole disease course. All HD subjects and most ASY patients had no underlying

12

comorbidity, while some patient of SYM, CON and RDP groups were diagnosed with

13

hypertension, hyperlipemia, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver

14

disease or chronic kidney disease (27). The routine laboratory test results

15

(supplementary Table 1) showed that the lymphocyte levels in the SYM and CON

16

groups were significantly lower than that in the HD group (two-tailed Mann–Whitney

17

U-test p < 0.05). However, such difference was not observed in ASY or RDP group.

18
19

Patients in different phases have heterogeneous TCR characteristics

20

Among all the clonotypes identified in our samples, only a small fraction was

21

shared by different groups (Figure 1A). No significant difference in clonal diversity (as

22

measured by D50 index, Shannon entropy and accumulative frequencies of the top 10

23

clones) was detected between any two groups (Figure 1B-D), suggesting that

24

COVID-19 might not necessarily induce a fundamental change in TCR repertoire

25

composition.

26

In the context of V-J gene usage, we assumed that the dissimilarity between

27

samples can be measured by the Spearman’s correlation coefficient of V-J combination

28

profiles (i.e., stronger positive correlation indicates lower dissimilarity). The dissimilarity

29

between ASY and HD subjects was significantly lower than that between SYM and HD

30

ones (Figure 2A), which demonstrated that asymptomatic infection could be a less

31

aversive stimulus on immune system than symptomatic phase. In addition, RDP

1

showed significantly lower dissimilarity to ASY than to other groups (Figure 2B),

2

suggesting potential commonality between asymptomatic and recurrent infections.

3

Differential gene usage in different phases of COVID-19

4

Since the immune responses could progress from ASY to SYM group, we further

5

analyzed the differential V-J gene usage. A total of 73 V-J pairings exhibited monotonic

6

trend for increasing or decreasing frequency across HD, ASY and SYM groups

7

(Cuzick's test for trend p < 0.05, Figure 3A and supplementary Table 2) (28), which

8

illustrated the details of the progressive immune responses. Of note, a significant

9

portion (28.8%, hypergeometric test p = 1.56 10-12) of these 73 V-J pairings also

10

showed differential usage between RDP and HD groups (Mann–Whitney U test p <

11

0.05, Figure 3B and supplementary Table 3), suggesting that certain aspects of

12

adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 could last till recovery and be awakened

13

upon recurrent infection.



14

Since HLA molecules play a crucial role in shaping the TCR repertoire (29), we

15

also sought to determine whether the frequency of certain HLA allele was imbalanced

16

in different groups. By performing Fisher’s exact test following a previously published

17

procedure (22), we confirmed that none of the HLA alleles had significant difference in

18

frequency across groups (Figure 4 and supplementary Table 4), which consolidated our

19

findings in TCR repertoire.

20
21

Discussion

22

Asymptomatic and recurrent infections further increased the difficulty of COVID-19

23

prevention. Here we presented an immunological landscape of COVID-19 patients in

24

different phases, by investigating not only SYM and CON patients but also ASY and

25

RDP ones. Our results demonstrated the divergent trajectories of COVID-19 and

26

particularly the unique characteristics of ASY and RDP patients.

27

Despite numerous recent studies on COVID-19 patients, our analysis adds

28

understanding of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in several aspects. First of all,

29

it has been repeatedly reported that clinical manifestations tend to vary between

30

asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (14, 30-32). In agreement with such

31

observation, we corroborated that the usage of certain V and J gene segments

1

exhibited monotonic trend across HD, ASY and SYM groups, indicating a possible

2

immune progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic phase. And those V-J

3

combinations showing monotonic changes along the ASY-to-SYM progression can help

4

narrow down the search scope of virus-associated TCR signatures. Identification of

5

TCR specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens may facilitate the development of highly targeted

6

immunotherapies, such as engineered T-cells for infusion(33, 34)

7

Next, the risk factors of recurrent infection are not yet well defined (15), which

8

urges development of useful biomarker to enhance clinical management. We found that

9

many V-J combinations with monotonic changes along the ASY-to-SYM progression

10

also showed biased usage in re-detectable positive cases. Such observation indicated

11

the possibility of examining immune repertoire as a measure of clinical outcome and an

12

early predictor of high-risk individuals.

13

Several limitations of our study should be taken into consideration. Firstly, multiple

14

phases of COVID-19 were characterized by blood samples collected from different

15

individuals, rather than sequential samples from the same infected patients. Therefore,

16

additional longitudinal studies are needed to calibrate the immunological trajectories of

17

COVID-19. Secondly, the enrolled patients were treated with diverse therapies and

18

medications, which may have divergent immunomodulatory effects. Subsequent efforts

19

will optimally require well-controlled clinical trials with unified treatment protocol. In

20

addition, due to limited volume of blood that could be collected in isolation wards, the

21

HLA typing was not performed by DNA sequencing or PCR but estimated with mRNA

22

sequencing data. Thus, the uncertain relevance between HLA alleles and TCR

23

repertoire in COVID-19 should be further explored.

24

Altogether, this study provided novel insights into the TCR profiles of COVID-19

25

patients in different phases. A better understanding of the adaptive immunity in

26

COVID-19 could strengthen clinical management and immunotherapy development.

27

Further analyses on large-scale immune repertoire datasets (35, 36) would be required

28

to extend our findings.

study. Between March and May in 2020, a total of 54 patients with laboratory confirmed

4

COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, the

5

Shunde Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, the Fourth People's

6

Hospital of Foshan, and the First People's Hospital of Foshan, China. The COVID-19

7

patients were classified into four groups: 1) The asymptomatic group were defined as

8

patients without self-perception or clinically recognizable symptoms during the whole

9

disease course but diagnosed as COVID-19 according to the Protocol for Prevention

10

and Control of COVID-19 (Edition 6) of National Health and Health Commission of

11

China (37); 2) The symptomatic group were those who had evident clinical symptoms

12

and were diagnosed as COVID-19 according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol

13

for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Version 7) of National Health and Health

14

Commission of China (38); 3) The convalescent group were those who met the

15

discharge standards in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus

16

Pneumonia (Version 7) of National Health and Health Commission of China(38); 4) The

17

re-detectable positive group were defined as patients with re ‐ positive results of

18

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid during the follow-up period after discharge from hospital. The

19

16 health donors were all enrolled at Shunde Hospital of Guangzhou University of

20

Chinese Medicine, China, who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited no

21

respiratory symptoms. Patient demographics and clinical manifestations were

TCR cDNA libraries for high-throughput sequencing were prepared by 5’rapid

3

amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the SMARTScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase

4

(Clontech, USA) as previously described (39, 40). Briefly, 0.6µg of total RNA was mixed

5

with the primer BC1R (Supplementary Table 6), which is specific for human TCRβ

6

cDNA synthesis. To denature RNA and anneal the priming oligonucleotides, RNA was

TCR library preparation

15

Two-round PCR was performed for TCR library preparation. For the first round of

16

PCR amplification, 45 µl of cDNA from the synthesis reaction was mixed with primers

17

and Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix(NEB, USA). The PCR program began with an

18

initial denaturation at 95°C for 1.5minutes, followed by 18 cycles of denaturation at

19

95°C for 10s, annealing of primer to DNA at 60°C for 20s, and extension at 72°C for 40s,

20

ended with an extension at 72°C for 4 min. For the second round of PCR amplification,

21

the product from the first round of PCR was purified by QIAquick PCR Purifcation Kit

22

(Qiagen, Germany), 10 µl of the purified product was used in each 25 µl PCR reaction.

23

The reaction was performed for 14 cycles using the first round PCR temperature

24

regimen. PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purifcation Kit (Qiagen,

25

Germany). Illumina adaptors were ligated using NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep

26

Kit for Illumina® (New England BioLabs, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol

Statistical analysis

13

Categorical variables were described as count (%), and two group comparison was

14

performed using Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were expressed as median

15

and interquartile range (IQR) values and compared by Mann–Whitney U test between

16

groups. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the association

17

between two vectors of quantitative variables. The significance of monotonic trend

18

across multiple groups was assessed by Cuzick's test (28). The significance of overlap

19

between tow gene sets was assessed by hypergeometric test (the “dhyper” function of

20

R software). All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.0.2). A

21

two-sided P-value lower than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Given the

22

exploratory nature of the present study, unadjusted p-values not accounting for multiple

23

testing were used to screen COVID-19 associated TCR variables.
