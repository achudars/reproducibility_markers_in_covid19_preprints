Running title: SARS-CoV2 Susceptibility Prediction in Domestic Animals

Abstract: The current new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused globally near 0.4/6 million
confirmed deaths/infected cases across more than 200 countries. As the etiological coronavirus
(a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate
reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly
unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential
zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell
receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in
wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors,
including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression
upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to
fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across
mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals
including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict
SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as
amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve
relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host
coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and
interferon optimization.

Introduction

Erupting in China last December, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a
worldwide pandemic and caused near 0.4 million confirmed deaths and 6 million infected cases
across 200 countries by the end of May 2020 [1,2]. The etiological virus, designated as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has been identified [3] and related to the viruses
previously causing SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans in 2003 and
2012, respectively [4]. These three human-pathogenic coronaviruses putatively evolve from bat
coronaviruses, but have different animal tropisms and intermediate reservoirs before transmission
to humans [4,5]. As civet cats and camels were retrospectively determined as reservoirs for SARS
and MERS respectively, there is no conclusion about what animal species passing SARS-CoV2 to
humans [4,5]. Investigations indicated that Canivora animals including raccoon dogs, red foxes,

badgers and minks as well swine, at a less extent, are susceptible to SARS virus infections [6,7].
Although the viral nucleic acids and antibodies to MERS were detectable in multiple ruminant
species including sheep, goat, and donkeys, the virus inoculation studies did not result in a
productive infection for MERS disease in these domestic ruminants, nor in horses [8,9].
As a group of obligate pathogens, viruses need to engage cell receptors for entering cells and race
with the host immunity for effective replication and spreading to initiate a productive infection [10].
In this context, the spike proteins protruding on the coronavirus surface are responsible for cell
receptor binding and mediating viral entry [5-7]. For example, MERS-CoV adopts the dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4, a.k.a. CD26) and SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as
primary receptors for cell attachment and entry [4-9]. Several groups have reported that SARSCoV2 uses the same ACE2 receptor as SARS-CoV, but exerts higher receptor affinity to human
ACE2, which may ascribe to the efficacy of SARS-CoV2 infection in humans [11,12]. After cell
attachment via the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the N-terminal S1 region of the S protein, the
C-terminal S2 region thus engages in membrane fusion. Further cleavage of S2 from S1 by a furinlike protease will release and prime the virus entering the recipient cells. Several furin-like
proteases, especially a broadly expressed trans-membrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are
adopted for priming SARS-CoV entry [11,12]. Compared with SARS-CoV, studies showed that
SARS-CoV2 spike protein also evolutionarily obtains an additional furin-like proteinase cleavage
site within the S1/S2 junction region for efficient release from the cell surface and entry into the cells
[3,11-13].
Because TMPRSS2 is widely expressed, the tissue-specific expression of ACE2 has been shown to
determine SARS-CoV2 cell tropism in humans [11,12]. Namely, human nasal secretory cells, type II
pneumocytes, and absorptive enterocytes are ACE2-TMPRSS2 double positive and highly
permissive to SARS-CoV2 infection [14, 15]. For cross-species animal tropism, the potential
infectivity of SARS-CoV2 in both wild and domestic animals raises a big public health concern after
the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infections in humans [16,17]. This concern involves two aspects: (1)
screening to identify the animal species that serve as a virus reservoir originally passing SARSCoV2 to humans; and (2) the existing risk of infected people passing the virus to animals,
particularly domestic species, thus potentially amplifying the zoonotic cycle to worsen SARS-CoV2
evolution and prevalence [16,17]. By diagnosis of animals in close contact with COVID-19 patients
or screening of animal samples in some COVID-19 epidemic zones, studies detected that domestic
cats and dogs could be virally or serologically positive for SARS-CoV2 [18-24], as was a reported
infection in a zoo tiger [25]. Using controlled experimental infection of human SARS-CoV2 isolates,
several studies demonstrated that ferrets, hamsters, domestic cats and some non-human primate
species are susceptible to human SARS-CoV2 strains [18-25]. Obviously, it is impractical to test
SARS-CoV2 susceptibility experimentally in all animal species. By adoption of a structural
simulation based on published structures of the viral S-RBD/ACE2 complex, studies have predicted
a broad spectrum of vertebrate species with high potential for SARS-CoV2 susceptibility, which, if
true, entails unexpected risks in both public and animal health, and warrants further critical
evaluation [26-28].
ACE2 is a key enzyme catalyzing angiotensin (AGT) further conversion into numeral active forms
of AGT1-9, which are hormonal mediators in the body’s renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [29,30].
Thus, ACE2 plays a regulatory role in the blood volume/pressure, body fluid balance, sodium and
water retention, as well as immune effects on apoptosis, inflammation, and generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [29,30]. In this line, the expression of ACE2 is also inter-regulated by immune
mediators pertinent to its systemic function. Multiple physio-pathological factors, including
pathogenic inflammation, influence on RAS through action on ACE2 expression [29-31]. Interferon
(IFN) response, especially that mediated by type I and type III IFNs, comprises a frontline of
antiviral immunity to restrict viral spreading from the initial infection sites, and therefore primarily
determines if a viral exposure becomes controlled or a productive infection [32]. Several recent

studies revealed that human ACE2 gene behaves like an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) and is
stimulated by a viral infection and IFN treatment; however, mouse ACE2 gene is not [15,33,34].
Therefore, to determine the cell tropism and animal susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, the cross-species
ACE2 genetic and especially epigenetic diversity in regulation of ACE2 expression and functionality
should be evaluated [26-34]. In this study, through integration of structural analysis and key
immunogenetic factors that show species-dependent differences, we critically refine the SARSCoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation [16-25]. Along with showing a
broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis [26-28], our
results further reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve
previously unexamined immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections.
2. Materials and Methods
Protein and promoter sequence extraction and alignment: The amino acid sequences of ACE2 proteins
and DNA sequences of the proximal promoters of each ACE2 genes were extracted from NCBI
Gene and relevant databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene). ACE2 genes and corresponding
transcripts have been well annotated in most representative vertebrate species. In most cases, the
annotations were double verified through the same Gene entries at Ensembl
(https://www.ensembl.org). The protein sequences were collected from all non-redundant transcript
variants and further verified for expression using relevant RNA-Seq data (NCBI GEO profiles). The
proximal promoter region spans ~2.5 kb before the predicted transcription (or translation) start site
(TSS) of ACE2 or other genes. The protein and DNA sequences were aligned using the multiple
sequence alignment tools of ClustalW or Muscle through an EMBL-EBI port
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Other sequence management was conducted using programs at the
Sequence Manipulation Suite (http://www.bioinformatics.org). Sequence alignments were
visualized using Jalview (http://www.jalview.org) and MEGAx (https://www.megasoftware.net).
Sequence similarity calculations and plotting were done using SDT1.2
(http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~brejnev). Other than indicated, all programs were run with default
parameters.
Phylogenic analysis: The phylogenic analysis and tree visualization were performed using MEGAx
and an online program, EvoView. The evolutionary history was inferred using the NeighborJoining method. Percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the
bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) was also performed. The evolutionary distances were computed
using the p-distance method and in units of the number of amino acid differences per site. Other
than indicated, all programs were run with default parameters as the programs suggested.
Structural simulation and analysis: The structure files of human ACE2 protein and its interaction with
SARS-CoV2 S-RBD were extracted from the Protein Data Bank under the files of 6M17 and 6M0J.
The residual mutation and structure simulation were performed using UCSF Chimera and Pymol
available at https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ and https://pymol.org/, respectively. Structural
visualization were using Pymol. The binding affinity energy (ΔG), dissociation constant (Kd) and
interfacial contacts between S-RBD and each ACE2 were calculated using an PRODIGY algorithm
at https://bianca.science.uu.nl/prodigy/.
Profiling transcription factor binding sites in ACE2 promoters and PWM scoring: The regulatory
elements (and pertinent binding factors) in the ~2.5 kb proximal promoter regions was examined
against both human/animal TFD Database using a program Nsite (Version 5.2013, at
http://www.softberry.com). The mean position weight matrix (PWM) of key cis-elements in the
proximal promoters were calculated using PWM tools through https://ccg.epfl.ch/cgibin/pwmtools, and the binding motif matrices of examined TFs were extracted from JASPAR Core
2018 vertebrates (http://jaspar.genereg.net/).

RNA-Seq and data analysis: For expression confirmation, several sets of RNA-Seq data from NCBI
Gene databases, and one of ours generated from porcine alveolar macrophages (BioProject with an
accession number of SRP033717), were analyzed for verification of the differential expression of
ACE2 genes in most annotated animal species. Especially, the expression of porcine ACE2 isoforms
and relevant other genes in the porcine lung macrophage datasets. Significantly differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) between two treatments were called using an edgeR package and
visualized using heatmaps or bar charts as previously described [58].
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Vertebrate ACE2 orthologs share an functional constraint but experience intra-species diversification
in livestock with unknown selective pressure
Sequence comparison among ACE2 orthologs across 30 representative vertebrate species shows a
pairwise identity range at 57-85% (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. S1 and Excel Sheet), which is 1527% higher than the average value generated through a similarity analysis at 30-70% on gene
orthologs at a genome-wide scale [35]. This indicates that ACE2 exerts a similar and basic function
cross-species, consistent with its systemic and regulatory role as a key enzyme in RAS, an essential
regulatory axis underlying the body circulatory and execratory systems in vertebrates [29-31]. A
comparison of evolutionary rates of major genes within RAS including angiotensinogen (AGT),
ACE, and several receptors of the processed angiotensin hormones showed that ACE2 actually
evolves slightly faster than ACE [36, and unpublished data]. This implies that ACE2 may bear
pressure for RAS adapting evolution per a species-dependent physiological and pathological
requirement [29-31]. This evolutionary adaptability of ACE2 genes is demonstrated by the existence
of numerical genetic polymorphisms [37] and several transcript isoforms particularly in humans
and major livestock species (Fig. 1B and Supplemental Fig. S1 and Excel Sheet). We identified (and
verified by RNA-Seq annotation) four transcripts of ACE2 isoforms in humans (Fig. 1B) that
primarily differ in the C-terminal 50 residues within the collectrin domain. Particularly, 1-2 short
ACE2 isoforms were identified in dogs, pigs, cattle, and goats in addition to the longer ACE2
consensus to the human’s (designated as –S or –L, respectively after the animal common names in
Fig. 1B and thereafter). These livestock ACE2-S isoforms have a 70-130 residual truncation at their
N-terminal peptidase domains, which also span the region interacting with SARS-CoV spike
protein. The selective mechanisms driving the evolution of these short ACE2 isoforms in livestock
are unknown, but may relate to previous pathogenic exposure or unprecedented physiopathological pressure. To support this reasoning, short ACE2 isoforms are detected in both
domestic Bos taurus and hybrid cattle, but not in the wild buffalo and bison; and ACE2 isoforms
from each species are generally paralogous and sister each other within a clade in the phylogenic
tree (Fig. 1B).
3.2. Incongruence of predicted SARS-CoV2 susceptibility to experimental data in selected major livestock
and reference animal species
Phylogenic analysis of vertebrate ACE2 orthologs/paralogs reveals a general relationship aligning
to the animal cladistics (Fig. 1B). In this context, homologs from the fish, frog and chicken conform
to a primitive clade. All ungulate homologs form into parallel clades next to each other. The
homologs from the glires, primates and carnivores cluster into a big clade (marked with yellow
triangle node), which contains all the SARS-CoV2 susceptible species that have been verified via
natural exposure or experimental infections (Fig. 1B, marked with red/orange circles). We examined
and merged several previous studies about the prediction of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in
vertebrates based on the simulated structural analysis of S-RBD-ACE2 complex [26-28]. As
numerous vertebrate species were predicted to be high or low potential (Fig. 1B, labeled as red H or
green L) for SARS-CoV2 susceptibility, incongruence between the predicted SARS-CoV2
susceptibility and infected validation is apparent in pangolin, ferret, tiger, cat and horseshoe bat,

indicating that some other factors besides ACE2-RBD affinity should be considered [15,32-34]. We,
therefore, refined the prediction matrix to include the RBD-binding evasion of some ACE2
orthologs identified in major livestock species and the interferon-stimulated ACE2 expression
underlying SARS-CoV2 infections [15,32-34].
3.3. A broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility potential based on structural analysis
Several recent studies have elegantly demonstrated the structural interaction of the viral S protein
or its RBD in complex with human ACE2 receptor [38,39]. Showing that the contacting residues at
the RBD/ACE2 interface (Fig. 2A) involve at least 19 residues in ACE2 (Fig. 2B, listed in the Table
cells and referred to the aligned residual positions in human ACE2) and 10 residues in the SARSCoV2 RBD (Fig. 2B, blue circles with residue labels above the Table) [28,38,39]. The cross-species
residual identity (%) of these interacting residues in ACE2 are dispersed in a broader range (32100%) than the whole ACE2 sequence identity rate at 57-85% [35], indicating a faster evolution rate
of this virus-interacting region. Notably, the S-binding region spans a large part of the N-terminal
peptidase domain and S-binding may competitively block a majority of active sites of the enzyme
(Fig. 2C).
Using a similar structural analysis procedure [27,28], we modeled the ACE2 structures of animal
species of interest and simulated their interaction with SARS-CoV2 S-RBD based on a published
RBD-human ACE2 structure (Protein Data Bank File 6M0J) [38]. Fig. 3 demonstrates the S-RBD
interaction with the simulated structures of ACE2 long isoforms from the dog, pig and cattle,
respectively. The major changes of the RBD-ACE2 interacting interfaces are from the residual
exchanges in ACE2 from other species compared with human ACE2 (Fig. 2B-2D, highlighted in
red). In addition, the exchange of N90T (in pigs) and N322Y (in cattle and sheep) would destroy the
N-glycosylation site in human ACE2. ACE2 from goat (Supplement Fig. S1) exhibits identical amino
acid exchanges as in cattle in the RBD-ACE2 interfacial contacts. In contrast,when compared with
human ACE2, ACE2 from cats (Supplement Fig. S1) conserves all relevant glycosylation sites in
human ACE2 [28,38]. We also calculated the interfacial contacts using parameters of protein-protein
interaction including the predictable binding affinity energy (ΔG), dissociation constant (Kd) and
number of different interfacial contacts within the S-RBD and ACE2 contact. Although the exact
numbers may differ from previous reports [38], they provide a very comparable matrix generated
using the same algorithm (Fig. 3E) [40]. Data show that the ACE2 of most domestic animals,
including that from mouse and rat (species known to be unsusceptible to human SARS-CoV2), have
a binding affinity (ΔG) at -11.2 to -12.8 kcal/mol. This is within the binding affinity range (11.2-12.9
kcal/mol) between the RBD and the ACE2 from known susceptible species (Fig. 3E, underlined in
the left part of the table). This indicates that other factors, conceivably from genetic divergence
and/or natural immunity, also contribute to SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in animal species. Therefore,
an effective prediction matrix should include the critical immunogenetic factors to further
determine virus susceptibility in addition to the sequence/structural similarity of ACE2 receptors
(Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) [15,34,37].
3.4. Identification of livestock short ACE2 isoforms that likely evade the binding by SARS-CoV2 Spike
protein
We detected several short ACE2 isoforms in the domestic animals including dog, pig, goat and
cattle that have an N-terminal truncation spanning 10-13 key residues in the contacting network to
S-RBD but retain the enzyme active sites (Fig. 4A). Most of the splicing isoforms of ACE2 genes,
such as in zebrafish, cats and humans, share a common proximal promoter and encode ACE2
proteins containing all 19 key RBD-interacting residues [38,39]. However, these short ACE2-S
isoforms in domestic animals truncate for 71 (Cattle/Goat ACE2-S) or 132 (Dog/Pig ACE2-S)
residues at their N-termini compared with the long ACE2 isoforms in the same species (Fig. 1 and
Fig. S1). Therefore, these short ACE2 isoforms destroy 10-13 key residues in the contacting network

to S-RBD but likely retain ACE2 enzymatic function in RAS. Paired structural comparison between
the human ACE2 structure (extracted from 6M17) with each simulated ACE2-S structure from the
pig, dog, and cattle/goat, reveals that all these ACE2-S orthologs from domestic animals,
particularly the porcine one, show high structural similarity to the human ACE2 except for the Nterminal truncations (Fig. 4B-4D). This indicates that these short ACE2 isoforms in domestic
animals have little chance to be engaged by the viral S-binding, and predict an unexpected
evolutionary advantage to allay potential COVID-19 risk resulting from viral engagement and
functional distortion on the classical long ACE2 isoforms in these animal species [37,41].
3.5. ACE2 genes in vertebrates obtain different propensity in response to viral infection and interferon
stimulation
SARS-CoV2 infection induces a weak IFN response but a production of a high amount of
inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and chemokine CXCL10 in most severe
COVID-19 patients [42-45]. Studies of SARS and MERS showed that these pathogenic coronaviruses
share similar viral antagonisms, including the endoribonuclease (EndoU) encoded by nonstructural
protein 15 (nsp15), which directly blunts cell receptors responding to viral dsRNA and in turn
weaken the acute antiviral response [46]. Several recent studies revealed that SARS-CoV2 seems
more cunning in not only evading or antagonizing but also in exploiting the IFN response for
efficient cell attachment [15,42,43,46]. As a key enzyme in RAS, the expression of ACE2 gene has
been primarily investigated for physiological response to circulatory regulations, and a response to
pathological inflammation is also expected [29-31]. However, the expression of the ACE2 gene was
highly responsive to both viral infection and host IFN response, i.e. human ACE2 gene seems an
unstudied IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) [15,33]. Surprisingly, the ISG propensity of ACE2 genes is
species-dependent, for example: the mouse ACE2 gene is less IFN responsive which may partly
explain the mouse insusceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection [15].
To categorize the different IFN-inductive propensity of ACE2 genes in vertebrates, particularly in
major livestock species, we profiled the regulatory cis-elements and relevant transcription factors in
the proximal promoter regions of each ACE2 genes (2.5 Kb before TSS or ATG). Figure 5 illustrates
major regulatory cis-elements located in ACE2 genes from major livestock animals and several
reference animal species. Data show that animal ACE2 gene promoters are evolutionally different in
containing IFN- or virus-stimulated response elements (ISRE, PRDI, IFRs, and/or STAT1/3 factors)
and cis-elements responsive to pro-inflammatory mediators. All these cis-elements recruit
corresponding transcription factors (TF) to mediate differential ACE2 responses to antiviral IFNs
and inflammation that is associated with COVID-19 disease [2,3,47]. We discover that ACE2 genes
obtain species-different ISG propensity responsive to IFN and inflammatory stimuli. In most (if not
all) of the SARS-CoV2 susceptible species the ACE2 genes obtained the IFN response between the
typical robust and tunable IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) [48]. In general, the robust ISGs (ISG15 is an
example here) are stimulated in the acute phase of viral infection and play a more antiviral role; in
contrast, the later responsive tunable ISGs (IRF1 is an example) contribute more to anti-proliferation
of IFN activity [48]. In addition, unlike the promoter of the short ACE2 isoforms in cattle and goats,
which share most common promoter regions with their paralogous long isoforms, the short ACE2
isoforms of dogs (Dog-S) and pigs (Pig-S) have distinct proximal promoter regions (and different
IFN responsivity) to the paralogous long ACE2 isoforms (Fig. 5 and Fig 6). Results indicate that the
short ACE2 isoforms in pigs and dogs diversify from their long paralogs at both the levels of
genetic coding and epigenetic regulation to adapt to some evolutionary pressure, such as that from
pathogenic interaction (Fig. 7) [37,49].
3.6. Matrix scores of interferon-inductive elements in ACE2 gene promoters correspond to SARS-CoV2
susceptibility

The position weight matrix (PWM) stands as a position-specific scoring model for the binding
specificity of a transcription factor (TF) on the DNA sequences [50]. Using PWM toolsets online
(https://ccg.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/pwmtools), we evaluate mean PWM of key cis-elements in the proximal
promoters of ACE2 genes that containing binding sites for canonical IFN-dependent transcription
factors, which include ISRE/STAT, IRF1. IRF3/7 and IRF8, as well as C/EBP representing a core
transcription factor for pro-inflammation. These IFN-dependent transcription factors, particularly
IRF3/7 and ISRE/STAT for IFN stimulation, are differentially enriched in the promoter regions of
ACE2 genes in a species-dependent way. Higher enrichment of ISRE/STAT1/3 and/or IRF3/7
binding sites are detected in most SARS-CoV2/COVID19 susceptible species (indicated with solid
orange or red circles, respectively). In contrast, the PWM for IRF1 and C/EBP, which regulate
inflammation, are less differentiated in ACE2 promoters from animal species, indicating that ACE2
genes are more universally regulated by inflammation than that by the viral infection or IFNinduction in a species-dependent way (Fig. 6). As compared with the promoters of a typical human
robust ISG15 and tunable IRF1 genes, this data indicate that ACE2 genes (particularly the primate
ones) are not typical robust or tunable ISGs as represented by ISG15 or IRF1, but respond
differently to viral infection (through IRF3/7) or IFN auto-induction (via ISRE/STAT) in a speciesdependent manner (Fig. 6) [48]. Higher enrichment of ISRE/STAT1/3 and/or IRF3/7 corresponds to
SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in experimentally validated mammalian species especially primates, but
not to the phylogenically distant species such as zebrafish, which has very low potential for SARSCoV2 susceptibility due to the high disparity of ACE2 structures (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). In addition,
the proximal promoters of the pig and dog ACE2-S genes differ much in their IFN-responsive
elements to most ACE2 promoters in mammalians (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). However, they are
phylogenically sister to the ACE2 promoters from the primitive vertebrates (frog, chicken and
zebrafish) (Fig. 7, phylogenic tree). This indicates that the expression of these short ACE2 isoforms
is more conservative than the long ACE2 isoforms, which represent a more recent evolution
obtaining ACE2 epigenetic regulation by IFN-signaling (Fig. 7) [49].
3.7. Integrating ACE2 structural analysis, isoforms variants, and interferon-association for SARS-CoV2
susceptibility prediction and validation
Studies show that affinity adaption of the viral S-RBD and ACE2 receptor determines the cellular
permissiveness to the virus [28,38,39]. SARS-CoV2 not only adapts a high binding affinity to human
ACE2 for cell attachment, but also antagonizes host antiviral interferon (IFN) response and utilizes
IFN-stimulated property of human ACE2 gene to boost spreading [15,38,39,49]. In addition to
structural analysis of simulated S-RBD-ACE2 interaction, we propose that several immunogenetic
factors, including the evolution of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms in some domestic animals, the
species-specific IFN system, and epigenetic regulation of IFN-stimulated property of host ACE2
genes, contribute to the viral susceptibility and the development of COVID-19-like symptoms in
certain animal species [15,38,39,49]. A computational program in development that incorporates
this multifactorial prediction matrix and in vitro validation of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in major
vertebrate species will be necessary to address public concerns relevant to SARS-CoV2 infections in
animals (Fig. 7). It will also lead to the development of better animal models for anti-COVID19
investigations [21]. In addition, several IFN-based therapies for treatment of COVID19 have been
proposed and are in the process of clinic trails [51-54]. Considering the viral stealth of IFNstimulated property of human ACE2, a timely and subtype-optimized IFN treatment should be
delivered rather than a general injection of typical human IFN-α/β subtypes [51-54]. In this line,
domestic livestock like pigs and cattle have a most evolved IFN system containing numerous
unconventional IFN subtypes. Some of these unconventional IFN subtypes, such as some porcine
IFN-ω exert much higher antiviral activity than IFN-α even in human cells and most IFN-λ retain
antiviral activity with less pro-inflammatory activity, could be utilized for developing effective
antiviral therapies [55,56]. In summary, a predication matrix, which integrates the structural
analysis of S-RBD-ACE2 interfacial interface and the species-specific immunogenetic diversity of
ACE2 genes, was used to predict the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility and fit current knowledge about the

infectious potential already validated in different animal species (Fig. 7). More extensive validation
experiments are needed to further improve this prediction matrix. Our current results demonstrate
several previously unstudied immunogenetic properties of animal ACE2 genes and imply some
domestic animals, including dogs, pigs and cattle/goats, may obtain some immunogenetic diversity
to confront SARS-CoV2 infection and face less COVID-19 risk than may have been previously
thought. However, immediate biosecurity practices should be applied in animal management to
reduce animal exposure to the virus and prevent potential species-specific adaptation (Fig. 7). For
livestock breeding programs that targeting disease resistance to respiratory viruses, the genetic and
epigenetic diversity of ACE2 genes as well antiviral ISGs are highly recommended [48,49,55,56].
In conclusion, SARS-CoV2 evolves to fit well with human (and non-human primates) ACE2
receptor through the structural interfacial affinity, immunogenetic diversity and epigenetic
expression regulation, which results in a highly infectious efficacy [1-3,15,28,38,39]. Most mammals,
especially those that belong to glires, primates and carnivores, have a higher potential for SARSCoV2 susceptibility but in a species-different manner based on the S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms
and the difference of the IFN-inductive propensity of the major ACE2 genes. Most ungulate animals
appear have a low susceptibility potential with horses and sheep having a high potential (Fig. 7).
Current development of IFN-based anti-COVID19 therapies should consider the ISG property of
human ACE2 gene to optimize for timely application using a highly-antiviral subtype that
potentially have less anti-inflammatory activity [55-57]. The evolution of the IFN complex and
functional diversity in domestic animals (such as pigs and cattle) provides a natural model for
optimizing IFN antiviral regulation and therapy development [55,56].

different species, and transcript variants identified within some species, were extracted from NCBI (and
Ensembl) Gene databases and verified using relevant RNA-Seq expression. (A) Sequence alignment was
performed with ClustalW and pairwise identity (%) was calculated and visualized using SDT1.2. The reciprocal
proteins for comparison on the horizontal are the same order as the vertical. Only NCBI Accession numbers are
listed, see the common names in (B). (B) The phylogenic tree of major identified ACE2 orthologs/variants from
different species was built with a Neighbor-joining approach and visualized using an EvoView program under
default parameter setting. The prediction of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility is based on the sequence similarity of
each ACE2 to human ACE2 in the S-RBD binding region and simulated using a published human ACE2-RBD
structure (6M0J) and refers to two recent publications using similar procedures but different structural models
[27,28]. Compared with the currently available experimental data, incongruence of the predicted SARS-CoV2
susceptibility is clearly demonstrated in pangolin, ferret, tiger, cat and horseshoe bat, indicating that some other
factors besides ACE2-RBD affinity should be considered.

Figure 2: Prediction of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in major livestock species based on the conservation
of key interacting residues and binding capacity between the viral spike (S) protein on the host ACE2
receptor. (A) SARS-CoV-2 uses the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry
and the serine protease TMPRSS2 and furin for S protein priming. (B)

As TMPRSS2 is broadly

expressed and active with a furin-like cleavage activity, the affinity adaption of the S receptor binding
domain (RBD) and ACE2 receptor determines the viral permissiveness. The contacting residues of
human ACE2 (a distance cutoff 4.5 Å) at the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 interfaces are shown, and the
contacting network involves at least 19 residues in ACE2 (listed in the Table cells and refer to the
aligned residual positions in human ACE2) and 10 residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (blue circles
with residue labels), which are listed and connected with black lines (indicating hydrogen bonds)
and red line (represents salt-bridge interaction). The cross-species residual identity (%) of these
interacting residues in ACE2 are listed in a broad range (32-100%) [26-28]. (C) We also detected
several short ACE2 isoforms (underlined) in the domestic animals including dog, pig, goat and cattle,
which have a N-terminal truncation spanning 10-13 key residues in the contacting network to S-RBD
but keeping the enzyme active sites (indicated by Yellow triangles), thus resulting in little
engagement by the viral S protein and predicting an unexpected evolutionary advantage for relieving
potential COVID-19 risk caused by the viral engagement and functional distortion on the classical
long ACE2 isoforms in these animal species.

The NCBI Accession Numbers of the ACE2 orthologs

are listed as in Fig. 1.

domestic animals ACE2 including that from mouse and rat (species known not to be susceptible to
SARS-CoV2) have a binding affinity (ΔG) at -11.2 to -12.8 kcal/mol that is within the range (11.2-12.9
kcal/mol) between the RBD and the ACE2 from the known susceptible species (underlined in the left
part of the table), indicating that some other factors, especially those from genetic divergence and
natural immunity, contribute to the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility of different animal species.
Figure 4: Detection of several short ACE2 isoforms (ACE2-S) in the domestic animals including dog,
pig, goat and cattle. (A) In contrast to most splicing isoforms such as in cats and humans, which share
a common proximal promoter and encode ACE2 proteins with similar sequences containing all 19
key RBD-interacting residues, these short ACE2-S isoforms in domestic animals truncate for 71
(Cattle/Goat ACE2-S) or 132 (Dog/Pig ACE2-S) residues at their N-termini compared with human
ACE2 or the long ACE2 isoforms in these species, thus destroying 10-13 key residues in the contacting
network to S-RBD but retaining all enzyme active sites (Yellow triangles in the blue ACE2 domain
bar). This results in little chance to be engaged by the viral S protein binding and predicts an
unexpected evolutionary advantage to relieve potential COVID-19 risk caused by the viral
engagement and functional distortion on the classical long ACE2 isoforms in these animal species.
(B), (C) and (D) Paired structural comparison between the human ACE2 structure (6M17) with each
simulated ACE2-S structure from pig (B), dog (C) and cattle/goat (D). Human ACE2 structure are in
green, and each compared animal ACE2-S structure in magenta. The N-terminal residues of both
compared structures are in cyan (arrows indicating N-termini of the ACE2-S isoforms) and shared Ctermini are in red. The 19 key S-interacting residues in human ACE2 are shown in blue sticks. In
general, all ACE2-S orthologs, particular the porcine, show high structural similarity to the human
ACE2 except the N-terminal truncations.

ACE2 gene promoters are evolutionally different in containing IFN- or virus-stimulated response
elements (ISRE, PRDI, IFRs, and/or STAT1/3 factors) and cis-elements responsive to proinflammatory mediators, which mediate different ACE2 responses to antiviral interferons (IFNs) and
inflammation associated with COVID-19 disease. Legend:

inflammatory response. These IFN-dependent transcription factors, particularly IRF3/7 and
ISRE/STAT critical for IFN stimulation, are differentially enriched in the promoter regions of ACE2
genes in a species-dependent way. Especially, increased enrichment of ISRE/STAT1/3 and IRF3/7
binding sites are detected in the SARS-CoV2/COVID19 susceptible species (indicated with solid
orange or red circles, respectively). In contrast, the PWM for IRF1 and C/EBP, which regulate
inflammation, are less differentially enriched in ACE2 promoters from different animal species. The
promoters of a typical human robust interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 and IRF1 (a typical tunable
ISG) are used as references. Higher enrichment of ISRE/STAT1/3 and IRF3/7 corresponds to SARSCoV2 susceptibility in experimentally validated animal species and humans. Abbreviations: C/EBP,

Figure 7: Prediction matrix and in vitro validation of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in major vertebrate
species based on (1) the binding capacity of the viral spike RBD on host ACE2 receptor; (2) the
promotion of animal ACE2 gene by the interferon response. Studies show that affinity adaption of
the viral Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and ACE2 receptor determines the viral susceptibility.
SARS-CoV2 not only adapts a high binding affinity to human ACE2 for cell attachment, but also
antagonizes the host antiviral interferon (IFN) response and utilizes the IFN-stimulated property of
human ACE2 gene to boost spreading.

Figure 1: Incongruence of predicted SARS-CoV2 susceptibility to experimental data in selected major livestock and reference animal species.
Protein sequences of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologs in different species, and transcript variants identified within some
species, were extracted from NCBI (and Ensembl) Gene databases and verified using relevant RNA-Seq expression. (A) Sequence
alignment was performed with ClustalW and pairwise identity (%) was calculated and visualized using SDT1.2. The reciprocal proteins for
comparison on the horizontal are the same order as the vertical. Only NCBI Accession numbers are listed, see the common names in (B).
(B) The phylogenic tree of identified ACE2 orthologs/variants from different species was built with a Neighbor-joining approach and
visualized using an EvoView program under default parameter setting. The prediction of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility is based on the
sequence similarity of each ACE2 to human ACE2 in the S-RBD binding region and simulated using a published human ACE2-RBD structure
(6M0J) and refers to two recent publications using similar procedures but different structural models [27,28]. Compared with the
currently available experimental data, incongruence of the predicted SARS-CoV2 susceptibility is clearly demonstrated in pangolin,
ferret, tiger, cat and horseshoe bat, indicating that some other factors besides ACE2-RBD affinity should be considered. We
emphasize to integrate other factors, including the RBD-binding evasion of some short ACE2 orthologs identified in some major livestock
species and the recently identified ACE2-interferon association [15], to refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction.

Figure 2: Prediction of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in major livestock species based on the conservation of key interacting residues and binding
capacity between the viral spike (S) protein on the host ACE2 receptor. (A) SARS-CoV-2 uses the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 and furin for S protein priming. (B) As TMPRSS2 is broadly expressed and active with a
furin-like cleavage activity, the affinity adaption of the S receptor binding domain (RBD) and ACE2 receptor determines the viral
permissiveness. The contacting residues of human ACE2 (a distance cutoff 4.5 Å) at the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 interfaces are shown, and the
contacting network involves at least 19 residues in ACE2 (listed in the Table cells and referring to the aligned residual positions in human ACE2)
and 10 residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (blue circles with residue labels), which are listed and connected with black lines (indicating hydrogen
bonds) and red line (represents salt-bridge interaction). The cross-species residual identity (%) of these interacting residues in ACE2 are listed
in a broad range (32-100%) [26-28]. (C) We also detected several short ACE2 isoforms (underlined) in the domestic animals including dog, pig,
goat and cattle, which have a N-terminal truncation spanning 10-13 key residues in the contacting network to S-RBD but keeping the enzyme
active sites (indicated by Yellow triangles), thus resulting in little engagement by the viral S protein and predicting an unexpected evolutionary
advantage for relieving potential COVID-19 risk caused by the viral engagement and functional distortion on the classical long ACE2 isoforms
in these animal species. The NCBI Accession Numbers of the ACE2 orthologs are listed as in Fig. 1.

Figure 3: Binding capacity of SARS-CoV2 spike protein (S) and its cell receptors (ACE2) from different animal species. (A) Structure of the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S from SARS-CoV2 (cyan) bound to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (blue). Most
residues involved in binding are highlighted as magenta (ACE2) or orange (S) sticks and labeled as one-letter amino-acid codes plus
residual numbers in bold or regular font respectively for S or ACE2 residues. The dotted/blue lines indicate intermolecular salt bridge or
hydrogen bonds between interacting residues (generated and visualized with UCSF Chimera and Pymol from Protein Data Bank File
6M0J). (B) to (D) RBD interaction with the simulated structures of ACE2 long isoforms from the dog, pig and cattle, respectively. Amino
acid exchanges in ACE2 from another species compared with human ACE2 are highlighted in red. E) Prediction of binding affinity energy
(ΔG), dissociation constant (Kd) and interfacial contacts of the SARS-CoV2 S-RBD with ACE2 orthologs of major livestock species. Most
domestic animals ACE2 including that from mouse and rat (species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV2) have a binding affinity
(ΔG) at -11.2 to -12.8 kcal/mol that is within the range (11.2-12.9 kcal/mol) between the RBD and the ACE2 from the known susceptible
species (underlined in the left part of the table), indicating that some other factors, especially those from genetic divergence and natural
immunity, contribute to the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility of different animal species.

Figure 4: Detection of several short ACE2 isoforms (ACE2-S) in the domestic animals including dog, pig, goat and cattle. (A) In contrast to
most splicing isoforms such as in cats and humans, which share a common proximal promoter and encode ACE2 proteins with similar
sequences containing all 19 key RBD-interacting residues, these short ACE2-S isoforms in domestic animals truncate for 71 (Cattle/Goat
ACE2-S) or 132 (Dog/Pig ACE2-S) residues at their N-termini compared with human ACE2 or the long ACE2 isoforms in these species,
thus destroying 10-13 key residues in the contacting network to S-RBD but retaining all enzyme active sites (Yellow triangles in the blue
ACE2 domain bar). This results in little chance to be engaged by the viral S protein binding and predicts an unexpected
evolutionary advantage to relieve potential COVID-19 risk caused by the viral engagement and functional distortion on the
classical long ACE2 isoforms in these animal species. (B), (C) and (D) Paired structural comparison between the human ACE2
structure (6M17) with each simulated ACE2-S structure from pig (B), dog (C) and cattle/goat (D). Human ACE2 structure are in green,
and each compared animal ACE2-S structure in magenta. The N-terminal residues of both compared structures are in cyan (arrows
indicating N-termini of the ACE2-S isoforms) and shared C-termini are in red. The 19 key S-interacting residues in human ACE2 are
shown in blue sticks. In general, all ACE2-S orthologs, particular the porcine, show high structural similarity to the human
ACE2 except the N-terminal truncations.

Figure 5. Categorizing ACE2 genes based on regulatory cis-elements predicted in their proximal promoter regions (<2 Kb before TSS or
ATG). The regulatory elements (and pertinent binding factors) in the ~2 kb proximal promoter regions were examined against both
human/animal TFD Database using a program Nsite (Version 5.2013, at http://www.softberry.com), including ACE2 genes identified in
major livestock animals and several reference animal species. Data show that animal ACE2 gene promoters are evolutionally different
in containing IFN- or virus-stimulated response elements (ISRE, PRDI, IFRs, and/or STAT1/3 factors) and cis-elements responsive to proinflammatory mediators, which mediate different ACE2 responses to antiviral interferons (IFNs) and inflammation associated with
COVID-19 disease. Legend: ○, GATA-1 regulating constitutive expression; acute (◊) or secondary (◊) IFN-stimulated response element
(ISRE) and PRDI that interact with IRF, ISGF3 and STAT factors, respectively; □, cis-elements interacting with factors to mediate immune/
inflammatory responses including C/EBP, NF-kB, NF-IL6, and p53; ●, cis-elements reacting with other factors significant in other
developmental/physiological responses. The promoter features of two typical human interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), the robust
ISG15 and tunable IRF1 are shown as references to indicate that ACE2 genes obtain species-different ISG propensity responsive to IFN
and inflammatory stimuli.

ACE2 genes that contain binding sites for canonical IFN-dependent transcription factors, which include
ISRE/STAT1/3, IRF1, IRF3/7 and IRF8, as well a C/EBP as a core transcription factors for proinflammatory response. These IFN-dependent transcription factors, particularly IRF3/7 and ISRE/STAT
critically for IFN stimulation, are differentially enriched in the promoter regions of ACE2 genes in a
species-dependent way. Especially, increased enrichment of ISRE/STAT1/3 and IRF3/7 binding
sites are detected in the SARS-CoV2/COVID19 susceptible species (indicated with solid orange or
red circles, respectively). In contrast, the PWM for IRF1 and C/EBP, which regulate inflammation, are
less differentially enriched in ACE2 promoters from different animal species. The promoters of a
typical human robust interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 and IRF1 (a typical tunable ISG) are
used as references. Abbreviations: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; IRF,

Fig. 7: Prediction matrix and in vitro validation of SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in major vertebrate species based on (1) the binding
capacity of the viral spike RBD on host ACE2 receptor; (2) the promotion of animal ACE2 gene by the interferon response.
Studies show that affinity adaption of the viral Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and ACE2 receptor determines the viral
susceptibility. SARS-CoV2 not only adapts a high binding affinity to human ACE2 for cell attachment, but also antagonizes the
host antiviral interferon (IFN) response and utilizes the IFN-stimulated property of human ACE2 gene to boost spreading.
