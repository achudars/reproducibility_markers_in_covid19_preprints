Abstract

3

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (CoV) causes COVID-19, a current global pandemic.

4

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is

5

proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease

6

complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive

7

target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10

8

complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a

9

highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures,

10

including those with a blocked 3´-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10

11

in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the

12

nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating

13

aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like

14

molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major

15

protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing

16

the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

3

From late 2019 and throughout 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease

4

COVID-19, has spread across the globe, to date infecting upwards of ten million

5

people and killing over half a million of these (coronavirus.jhu.edu). A detailed

6

understanding of the mechanistic aspects of this virus’ life and infectivity cycle are

7

urgently required as are drugs that are able to curb its replication and virulence.

8
9

SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV), of the coronaviridae family in the Nidovirales

10

order. One characteristic of these CoVs is their (relatively) large single-stranded RNA

11

genomes (~30 kb in the case of SARS-CoV-2)1. Perhaps necessarily, CoVs typically

12

have a replication fidelity rate of an order of 10-6 to 10-7, which is several orders of

13

magnitude more accurate than that of most RNA viruses (typically ~10-3 to 10-5)2. In

14

order to maintain the fidelity of these genomes during replication, CoVs rely upon a

15

complex of two non-structural proteins, nsp14 (also known as ExoN) and nsp102-4.

16

The importance of this enhanced level of replication fidelity has been demonstrated in

17

studies that disrupt or inactivate the activity of nsp14-nsp10, where reduced virulence

18

and pathogenesis is seen in mouse and cellular models4-6. Therefore, targeting nsp14-

19

nsp10 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, either as a standalone option or as an

20

adjuvant to other agents that target other features of the replication cycle of the virus7.

21
22

The nsp14-nsp10 proteins form a complex where a ribonuclease activity is conferred

23

by the DEDD catalytic motif of nsp14, but where nsp10 plays a key role in conferring

24

full activity3,8,9. A study of the SARS-CoV-1 complex implied that its ribonuclease

25

activity is dsRNA selective3. This complex has been reported to possess 3′-5′

26

exonuclease activity and, based on its ability to excise terminally mismatched

27

ribonucleotides, one function ascribed to nsp14-nsp10 (by analogy with replicative

28

DNA polymerases) is ′proofreading′ activity3,10, although other key roles in viral

29

replication have been postulated11. Consistent with a role in proofreading of

30

maintaining genome stability, nuclease-inactivating mutations in CoV DEDD motifs

31

cause an elevated level of replication errors, impaired replication and in some cases

32

lethal mutagenesis4,5,12. Moreover, nsp14 interacts with the CoV RNA-dependent RNA

33

polymerase (RdRp), (i.e. the nsp12 subunit of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex),

3

2

integrating the nuclease activities of nsp14 with the replicative process, although the

3

molecular details of this interaction remain only partly characterised10,11. The nsp14

4

protein also contains a functionally distinct (from its nuclease) SAM-dependent (S-

5

adenosyl methionine) guanine-N7 methyl transferase (MTase) activity13-15. This

6

activity is required in the third step in production of the mature 5′-RNA CoV cap

7

structure (cap-1), methylating a 5′-5′ triphophosphate GpppN generating the cap-0

8

intermediate.

9
10

Here, we describe purification of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex and detailed

11

characterisation of its nuclease activity and substrate profile. We find that the complex

12

is a highly versatile nuclease able to not only potentially able act in a proofreading

13

capacity, but which is also capable of processing a structurally diverse range of RNA

14

molecules, in both ssRNA and dsRNA. Notably, some of the activities observed do not

15

require a free 3′-OH group, implying that nsp14-nsp10 exhibits both exo- and

16

endonuclease like activities. We propose that nsp14-nsp10 could act broadly to

17

remove structures accumulating within the nascent replicating RNA strand that would

18

potentially affect high fidelity extension by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA

19

polymerase (RdRp)16. We also used the assay systems we developed to screen for

20

inhibitors, identifying several drugs and drug-like molecules that might be repurposed

21

to inhibit the nuclease activity of this complex.

22
23

RESULTS

24

SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 is a dimeric nuclease

25

Employing codon optimised constructs expressed in E. coli, we purified the nsp14-

26

nsp10 complex to near homogeneity (Fig. 1a). The presence of faint protein bands

27

between the nsp14 and nsp10 proteins which were visible by SDS-PAGE were

28

confirmed to be nsp-14 degradation products by tryptic digest MS/MS analysis. The

29

complex eluted from the size-exclusion column with a volume consistent with a

30

heterodimer (Supplementary Fig. 1a), and the identity of the protein was confirmed by

31

intact mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In addition to the wild-type protein,

32

we purified a control complex bearing substitutions at residues D113 and E115

33

(nsp14D113A,E115A-nsp10) which by comparison with previously evaluated SARS-CoV-

2

1 complex is expected to be catalytically inactive (Fig. 1a)8. Moreover, we purified the

3

nsp14 (ExoN) subunit alone to determine its individual activity (bacterial expressed

4

nsp10 rapidly precipitated in solution, presumably requiring association with nsp14 to

5

maintain solubility, as previously proposed8) (Fig. 1a).

6
7

Previous studies of the CoV nsp14-nsp10 complexes have been limited to the SARS-

8

Cov-1 strain proteins3,9. In the latter study, a preferential activity on double-stranded

9

DNA (dsRNA) over single-stranded DNA (ssRNA) combined with an enhanced

10

capacity to process substrates with mismatches within 4-ribonucleotides of a 3′-OH

11

was reported. For the Sars-CoV-2 complex, we performed an extensive evaluation of

12

RNA structures, sequences and modifications to comprehensively define the major

13

activities of the complex. We initially utilised a 20-mer ssRNA substrate radiolabelled

14

at the 5′-end. It has previously been reported that while nsp14 alone is active as a

15

nuclease, its activity is substantially increased by association with nsp103,8. To test

16

this, we incubated the ssRNA substrate with nsp14 alone, and the nsp14-nsp10

17

complex. Substrate digestion was observed for nsp14 at concentrations above 250

18

nM (on 10 nM of substrate). We confirmed that nsp10 dramatically enhances the

19

activities of nsp14, as efficient digestion by nsp14-nsp10 was observed at the lowest

20

concentration employed (15 nM) (Fig. 1b). We next examined the activity of nsp14-

21

nsp10 on sequence-related ssRNA substrates of varying length. Whilst no activity

22

could be observed with a 10-mer, possibly because this substrate is too short to permit

23

stable binding of the nsp14-nsp10 complex, robust activity at concentrations above

24

250 nM was observed with a 30-mer (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Moreover, for both the

25

20-mer and 30-mer substrates a complex digestion pattern was observed

26

(Supplementary Fig. 1c). We saw RNA laddering close to the 3′-terminus, consistent

27

with the previously reported 3′-exonuclease activity of this complex, but also several

28

additional prominent additional bands representing cleavage further from the 3′-end.

29

We next precisely identified the size of the major products released by the nsp14-

30

nsp10 on the 20-mer substrate. In order to do this, we performed limited hydrolysis on

31

the 20-mer substrate to provide a single-nucleotide molecular weight marker

32

(Supplementary Fig. 1d). This enabled us to determine that the laddering products

33

observed at the top of the gel correspond to fragments digested in a single-nucleotide

2

fashion from the 3′-end, and that this processing terminates at the 8th ribonucleotide

3

from the 3′-end (labelled with *). Two additional prominent bands were identified,

4

corresponding to cleaved 10th and 13th ribonucleotides from the 3′-end, releasing a

5

10-mer and 7-mer product (labelled on Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1d as ** and

6

***, respectively).

7
8

We then confirmed that the activities we observed are intrinsic to the nsp14-nsp10

9

complex by two complementary methods. First, we purified the predicted nuclease

10

inactive complex nsp14D113A,E115A-nsp10 and assayed its activity on the 20-mer

11

substrate. No activity was observed, even at concentrations 10-fold higher that the

12

highest concentration employed with the wild-type complex (5000 nM for

13

nsp14D113A,E115A-nsp10 versus 500 nM for nsp14-nsp10; Fig. 1b). Second, we ran the

14

wild-type nsp14-nsp10 complex on a gel filtration (size exclusion) column and then

15

assayed the eluted fractions for RNase activity. The elution profile of the heterodimeric

16

protein from this column precisely coincided with the peak in the characteristic RNase

17

activity we observe (Supplementary Fig. 1e), providing further reassurance that the

18

activities we are observe are intrinsic to the complex we have purified and not due to

19

a contaminant.

20
21

Finally, as previous biochemical and structural studies imply that the nuclease activity

22

of the ExoN family of nucleases is dependent upon divalent metal cations, we sought

23

evidence that this is the case for SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp103,8,9. First, we determined

24

which divalent cations support maximal activity of the complex. Both magnesium and

25

manganese promoted the RNase activity of nsp14-nsp10, whereas zinc was inhibitory

26

(Supplementary Fig. 2a. Consistent with a requirement for metal ions for activity, three

27

metal-chelating agents, EDTA, EGTA and ο-phenanthroline were strongly inhibitory,

28

with a particular sensitivity to EDTA (Supplementary Fig. 2b). For further studies, we

29

chose to perform reactions in the presence of magnesium as this efficiently supports

30

nsp14-nsp10 activity while being highly abundant in the mammalian cytoplasm.

2

Effects of RNA sequence and 3′-terminus structure on nsp14-nsp10 activity

3

The RNA sequence dependency of CoV nsp14-nsp10 complexes has yet to be

4

examined systematically. Initially, we compared the activity of nsp14-nsp10 on the 20-

5

mer substrate employed throughout Fig. 1 with its activity on a sequence-unrelated

6

20-mer ssRNA. Both substrates are of mixed sequence and contain all four bases. It

7

is striking that the pattern and efficiency of digestion on these two substrates was

8

indistinguishable suggesting that for RNA substrates of mixed sequence, the precise

9

sequence is not a major determinant of digestion pattern (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, when

10

nsp14-nsp10 was presented with 20-mer poly(A) or 20-mer poly(U) substrates, the

11

activity of the complex was dramatically reduced and qualitatively altered (Fig. 2b).

12

For poly(U), step-wise digestion to the 11th ribonucleotide from the 3′-end was

13

observed, whereas for the poly(A) substrate the pattern of digestion was similar but

14

was curtailed at the 8th or 9th nucleotide from the 3′-terminus. However, it is important

15

to note that the concentration of enzyme required to observe any digestion on the

16

poly(U) and poly(A) substrates (250 nM) is substantially higher than those required to

17

efficiently digest RNA substrates of mixed sequence (compare Figs. 2a and 2b). We

18

tentatively propose that nsp14-nsp10 might possess reduced activity on poly(U) and

19

poly(A) sequences to prevent the degradation of the 3′-tails of both viral and host

20

transcripts, which could be inhibitory to efficient viral replication. Notably, unlike

21

poly(A) tails in positive sense viral transcripts, poly(U) sequences in negative sense

22

transcripts can act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and alert the

23

innate immune system. Poly(U) transcripts can be degraded by CoV nsp15 which is

24

perhaps dedicated to performing this reaction, but in a regulated fashion17.

25
26

A key difference between our observations and those previously reported for the

27

SARS-Cov-1 complex relate to the ability of nsp14-nsp10 to process ssRNA

28

substrates; for SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10, a strong preference for dsRNA over

29

ssRNA substrates was reported3. To examine if the Cov-2 complex also exhibits a

30

preference for ds- over ssRNA, we tested its activity on sequence-identical ssRNA,

31

dsRNA, and hybrid RNA:DNA substrates (where the RNA strand is 5′-radiolabelled)

32

(Fig. 2c). We did not observe a preference for dsRNA over ssRNA, in fact the converse

33

was observed since higher concentrations of nsp14-nsp10 were required to produce

7

2

the same extent of digestion for dsRNA when compared to ssRNA (Fig. 2c and

3

quantified in Fig. 2d). Moreover, the enzyme appears to be agnostic to the nature of

4

the strand annealed to the RNA substrate strand, since the RNA component of the

5

RNA:DNA hybrid was digested with efficiency equal to the ssRNA substrate (Fig. 2c).

6

Previous studies of SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10 concluded the complex possesses 3′-

7

exonuclease activity, since activity was reduced when the 3′-hydroxyl terminus of the

8

substrates examined was replaced by a phosphate group3. To examine this point for

9

the SARS-CoV-2 complex, we compared the activity of nsp14-nsp10 on three

10

sequence-identical substrates bearing either a 3′-hydroxyl, 3′-phosphate, or 3′-biotin

11

moiety (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the characteristic ladder of products extending from the

12

full-length substrate (at the top of the gel) was strongly reduced when the 3′-hydroxyl

13

was replaced by a biotin group only. However, the other major products (7-mer and

14

10-mer) observed on the substrate with the hydroxyl terminus were variably affected

15

when the 3′-end was replaced with a phosphate or biotin. In the presence of the 3′-

16

phosphate, the 10-mer product was still observed, being produced in approximately

17

equal amounts as for the 3′-hydroxyl substrate, while the 7-mer product was observed

18

at slightly higher concentrations (above 250 nM) compared to the 3′-hydroxyl

19

substrate. With a 3′-biotin substrate, higher enzyme concentrations were required to

20

observe cleavage with predominantly the 10-mer product being observed at

21

concentrations above 250 nM. The 12-mer product was still observed at

22

concentrations above 125 nM, albeit very faintly, whilst the 7-mer product was only

23

observed at the highest concentration (500 nM). Together, these observations strongly

24

suggest that SARS-CoV-2 not only has a 3′-exonuclease activity, which is dependent

25

upon the presence of an unblocked 3′-RNA terminus (leading to the laddering

26

products we characteristically observe at the top of the gels), but also an

27

endonucleolytic activity, cleaving at positions further from the 3′-end. These incisions

28

occur independently of the presence of a 3′-hydroxyl or phosphate group, and

29

therefore do not require engagement with a 3′-terminus prior to initial exonucleolytic

30

processing at the 3′-terminus for their production. Interestingly, in the presence of

31

manganese the main cleavage product is the 7-mer, suggesting that this ion enhances

32

the endonuclease activity (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

2

To date, CoV nsp14-nsp10 complexes have been reported to act exclusively on RNA.

3

To confirm that this is the case for the Sar-CoV-2 complex, we compared the activity

4

of nsp14-nsp10 on our 20-mer ssRNA substrate with its activity on sequence-related

5

20-mer ssDNA and DNA:RNA hybrid substrates (where the DNA strand is 5′-

6

radiolabelled) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). As expected, no activity was observed on

7

either DNA substrate. We also examined the ability of nsp14-nsp10 to act on substrate

8

containing a single ribonucleotide embedded within an 18-mer DNA duplex (3-

9

ribonucleotides form the 3′-end), analogous to the types of substrate processed by

10

ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 3a)18. Some

11

activity was observed at concentrations above 125 nM with the two products released

12

being consistent with incisions being introduced 3′- and 5′-to the site of the embedded

13

ribonucleotide. While not necessarily physiologically relevant, this activity is

14

informative regarding the proposed endonucleolytic activity of this complex, since the

15

3′-DNA terminus of this substrate is completely resistant to nsp14-nsp10, but

16

nonetheless nsp14-nsp10 can cleave adjacent to the single embedded ribonucleotide.

17
18

Impact of mismatches, flaps and chemical modification on nsp14-nsp10 activity

19

It has been reported that the SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10 complex preferentially

20

degrades substrates containing mismatches of up to 4-ribonucleotides at their 3′-

21

termini3,10. To address this possibility for the SARS-CoV-2 complex, we generated

22

substrates containing 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-ribonucleotide mismatches at their 3′-termini,

23

where the 4-ribonucleotide mismatch effectively introduces a small 3′-flap allowing us

24

to examine the impact of this secondary structure on activity. We observed no

25

substantial difference in digestion efficiency across any of these four structures (Fig.

26

3b and quantified in Supplementary Fig. 3b), although there were qualitative

27

differences in the major products released, likely reflecting differential modes of

28

association of the complex due to the structural variations in the substrates. We also

29

examined a substrate containing a single mismatch near its centre (8-ribonucleotides

30

from the 3′-end). This was also processed with an efficiency indistinguishable from

31

the other substrates, exhibiting a qualitative pattern of digestion similar to the

32

substrates containing the terminal mismatches (Fig. 3b and quantified in

33

Supplementary Fig. 3b). Taken together, our results show that mismatched termini are

2

not preferentially processed by the SARS-Co-V-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex, but rather

3

the complex is an exo- and endo-nuclease able to act on a wide variety of RNA

4

substrates, both single- and double-stranded.

5
6

Finally, we examined whether some common modifications of viral RNA impact the

7

RNase activity of nsp14-nsp10. We investigated the impact of 6-methyladenine, one

8

of the most common modifications found in cytoplasmic RNA, along with an artificial

9

base modification, 2-methyladenine. Importantly, 6-methyladenine modification has

10

been associated with viral evasion by the host innate immune system19. We also

11

examined the variant RNA base inosine, that can be generated by A-to-I editing and

12

has been reported to enhance viral recognition by the innate immune sensors20. When

13

any of these modified bases was placed two ribonucleotides from the 3′-terminus of

14

the 20-mer substrate, none affected, either qualitatively or quantitatively, activity of

15

nsp14-nsp10

16

(Supplementary Fig. 3c). We conclude that some common chemical modifications of

17

RNA do not substantially affect nsp14-nsp10 RNase activity.

Identification of nsp14-nsp10 inhibitors

20

The urgent need to identify therapeutics to treat COVID-19 then led us to scope

21

potential nsp14-nsp10 inhibitors, with a focus on compounds identified as potential

22

COVID-19 treatments and known nuclease inhibitors. Previous studies suggest that

23

inactivation of nsp14-nsp10 can lead to increased genomic instability and therefore a

24

potentially lethal mutagenesis and concomitant reduction in viral propagation. While

25

this alone might be insufficient to treat COVID-19 effectively, the possibility that nsp14-

26

nsp10 inhibitors could be combined with inhibitors of other key factors (for example,

27

the major proteases 3CLpro/Mpro or replicative RNA polymerase catalytic subunit

28

nsp12) merits exploration.

29
30

Based on the efforts of ourselves and others to identify inhibitors of RNA and DNA

31

nucleases, we first performed in silico docking experiments focusing on chemotypes

32

known to inhibit nucleases. We employed the AutoDock Vina21 platform to dock in-

33

house compounds on the entire exposed surface (blind docking) and the surface

centred on the active site of a structure of SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-10 (PDB:5NFY)10. Use

3

of a homology model of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 created using PDB:5NFY was

4

considered inappropriate due to the low resolution of this structure. The docking

5

analyses revealed a range of pharmacophores that may interact with the enzyme

6

(Supplementary Fig. 4a), and one of these, an N-hydroxyimide compound (denoted

7

A-1) was identified as potentially interacting with the nsp14-nsp10 active site (Fig. 5a;

8

Supplementary Fig. 4a).

9
10

Efforts to establish a quantitative fluorogenic assay for nsp14-nsp10 activity,

11

analogous to those we and others have devised for endo- and exonucleases

12

previously22, have as yet been unsuccessful due to the exquisite sensitivity of the

13

nsp14-nsp10 complex to substrate modification by all fluor and quench moieties

14

tested. We therefore utilised a gel-based nuclease assay employing the 20-mer

15

ssRNA described above to examine the potential inhibitory characteristics of the

16

compound A-1, and its positional isomer A-2, available to us from existing chemical

17

libraries. The chemical aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), which is a promiscuous

18

ribonuclease inhibitor used during nucleic acid extraction protocols was used as a

19

positive control23; as expected, inhibited nsp14-nsp10 with an IC50 of 7.6 ± 1.1 μM

20

(Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 5). Fig. 4a shows the inhibitory characteristics of A-1 and

21

A-2 N-hydroxyimides in the gel-based assay, each of which exhibit qualitatively

22

complete inhibition of substrate digestion (Fig. 4a). Quantification of the gel-based

23

nuclease assay data did not yield an IC50 value for A-1, however, for A-2 this was

24

determined to be 20 ± 0.5 μM (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 5). Based on the docking

25

data of A-1 and potency of A-2 in the gel-based assay, we synthesised three structural

26

variants of these compounds. We decided to remove one of the rings, and use a

27

bicyclic hydroxyimide scaffold, as has previously been used against the nucleases

28

FEN1 and XPF-ERCC124,25; these compounds were denoted A-3 and A-4. We also

29

attempted to introduce a thiocarbonyl (A-5) to examine the potential effects on

30

inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, none of these exhibited a lower IC50, and

31

therefore greater potency than A-2 (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 6). It is important to

32

note that due to nature of the gel-based assay, and the quality of the curves extracted,

33

that the absolute IC50 values should be regarded as preliminary, though complete

inhibition of nuclease activity is observed for A-1, A-2, A-3, B-1 and raltegravir at

3

concentrations of 100 µM.

4
5

The N-hydroxyimide pharmacophore based is reported to inhibit structure-selective

6

DNA nucleases, via chelation of an active site metal ion(s) (particularly Mg2+)24,25. Our

7

in silico docking shows potential for N-hydroxyimide compound binding at the nsp14-

8

10 active site, with polar inhibitor atoms positioned close to the catalytic Mg2+; wherein

9

for A-1 two of the hydroxyimide oxygen atoms are a distances of 2.4 Å and 2.6 Å from

10

the Mg2+ (Fig. 5A).The crystal structure of the human FEN1 nuclease with an N-

11

hydroxyimide-based compound, AZ13623940 (denoted AZ-B1), bound to the active

12

site has previously been reported (PDB: 5FV7)26. To allow possible mechanistic

13

insight, the docking pose of AZ-B1 and its interaction with the catalytic Mg2+ in the

14

nsp14-nsp10 model was compared with a structure of FEN1 in complex with AZ-B1

15

(Fig. 5b). While there was little overlap of the highest predicted affinity active site-

16

docked pose of AZ-B1 with the AZ-B1 binding mode in the FEN1 structure, the fourth

17

pose did align well with the Mg2+ of nsp14-nsp10, close to a FEN1 Mg2+ (Fig. 5b), also

18

validating the ability of AutoDock Vina to place compounds near divalent metal ions.

19
20

Taking advantage of previous identification and detailed characterisation of a series

21

of FEN-1 inhibitors26, we determined whether this molecule (AZ-B1), and AZ1353160

22

(denoted AZ-A1) are also capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10. While

23

some inhibition was observed (Supplementary Fig. 7), these were also inferior to A-2.

24
25

The N-hydroxypyrimidinone ring is structurally similar to N-hydroxyimide and

26

hydroxypyrimidinones inhibit nucleases through binding to the active site metal ion(s),

27

typically Mg2+27,28. Therefore, we tested the commercially available compound 5,6-

28

dihydroxyl-2-phenylpyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid (denoted B-1). B-1 exhibited a

29

comparable inhibition profile to A-2 with an IC50 value of 32.2 ± 4.5 μM (Fig. 4;

30

Supplementary Fig. 5). We also tested raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, which

31

contains a hydroxypyrimidinone ring27,28. Similar to B-1, raltegravir exhibited clear

32

inhibition of the exonuclease activity of nsp14-nsp10 with an IC50 value of 24.4 ± 2.7

33

μM (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 5). Our in silico approach modelled B-1 docked

2

proximal to the active site of nsp14-nsp10, with an oxygen atom of the

3

hydroxypyrimidinone coordinating the catalytic Mg2+, at a distance of 2.7 Å (Fig. 5c).

4

Docking shows B-1 can bind at the active site of nsp14-10, with an oxygen atom of

5

the hydroxypyrimidinone coordinating the catalytic Mg2+( 2.7 Å) (Fig. 5c). The docked

6

pose of raltegravir differed from that of B-1, however, it was again positioned close to

7

the active site Mg2+, making additional contacts within the putative substrate binding

8

pocket (Fig. 5D).

9
10

These experiments provided important insight into pharmacophores that may be

11

further developed and tested as COVID-19 treatments. However, the urgency of

12

addressing COVID-19 requires that experimental or approved drugs can be

13

repurposed for treatment. We therefore undertook at low-throughput (limited by the

14

lack of a scalable fluorescent assay) screen of candidate drugs that might be

15

predicted, on the basis of their mechanism of action, to inhibit the nuclease activity of

16

nsp14-nsp10. These included nucleoside analogues, topoisomerase poisons,

17

candidate DNA repair inhibitors, compounds reported to inhibit other COVID-19

18

targets and antivirals believed to interfere with nucleic acid metabolism. The

19

compounds tested and the results from the gel-based nuclease assay screening are

20

summarised in Supplementary Table 2). Of these, ebselen (an organoselenium

21

molecule with broad pharmacological properties29,30 and a known potent inhibitor of

22

the main CoV protease 3CLpro) and disulfuram (a carbothioamide used to treat alcohol

23

dependence31) appeared most active in our screen. Detailed analysis allowed us to

24

determine that the IC50 for ebselen and disulfuram are 3.3 ± 0.09 μM and 89 ± 33 μM,

25

respectively (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 5). We also included thiram, a non-drug

26

compound (used as a fungicide) which is also a carbothioamide related to disulfuram

27

to determine whether this chemotype more generally acts to inhibit nsp14-nsp10. The

28

IC50 for thiram was 48.2 ± 1.8 µM, suggesting that further surveys of carbothioamides

29

are warranted in the search for nsp14-nsp10 inhibitors.

30
31

To ensure the compounds that exhibited inhibitory effects were not exerting these

32

through aggregation or precipitation of nsp14-nsp10, we employed differential

33

scanning fluorimetry (DSF) under identical reaction conditions to the inhibitor nuclease

13

2

assays. None of the inhibitors showed any destabilising effect on thermal stability of

3

nsp14-nsp10, with the exception of ATA at higher concentrations (Supplementary Fig.

4

8).

5
6

Ebselen has generally well-tolerated in clinical studies investigating its effectiveness

7

for treating a range of conditions from stroke and hearing loss to bipolar disorder29.

8

One mechanism of action proposed for ebselen relates to the potential capacity of the

9

selenium to react with the thiolate ligands of zinc clusters in proteins and to release

10

zinc32-35. To test whether the selenium is critical for the inhibition of nsp14-nsp10

11

nuclease activity, we investigated an analogue of this molecule, PBIT, where a sulphur

12

atom replaces the selenium. Consistent with an important role for the selenium in

13

nsp14-nsp10 inhibition, PBIT demonstrated a dramatically reduced potency of

14

inhibition (Fig. 6a). We conclude that the best, potentially clinically useful nsp14-nsp10

15

inhibitor we have identified is the Mpro inhibitor ebselen, where the selenium moiety

16

plays an important role mediating its inhibitory effects.

17
18

In conjunction with our low-throughput nuclease assay inhibitor screening, all

19

compounds tested were screened for binding to SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10 using

20

AutoDock Vina. There was no clear relationship between the calculated docking

21

affinities and the extent of exonuclease inhibition in vitro, either for the active site or

22

full surface docking (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2), in part

23

reflecting the likely covalent inhibition by compounds such as ebselen, underlining the

24

need for experimental validation of hits proposed by computational docking

25

simulations. Interestingly, the majority of primary docked poses were located in the

26

nsp14 ExoN-MTase domain boundary, within a pore that is otherwise occupied by

27

substrates of the methyltransferase reaction, G5′ppp5′A and S-adenosyl methionine

28

(PDB: 5C8S) (Supplementary Fig. 4c–e)8. While compounds docked at this site may

29

be unlikely to have an impact on competitive inhibition of nsp14-nsp10 nuclease

30

activity, this suggests that the MTase active site may also be an attractive target,

31

whereby compounds may hinder the binding of MTase cognate substrates.

DISCUSSION

3

Here we present the first biochemical analysis of the nsp14-nsp10 protein complex,

4

that plays a key role in the genome duplication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative

5

agent for COVID-19. Previous studies of the related SARS-CoV-1 complex have

6

primarily focused on structural aspects8,10. The 3′-exonuclease activity of the CoV-1

7

was complex was reported, but it was not subject to detailed biochemical analysis.

8
9

Our study confirms the presence of a 3′-exonuclease activity in the Cov-2 nsp14-

10

nsp10 complex, which is curtailed when the 3′-hydroxyl terminus of the RNA substrate

11

is changed to a biotin group. Altering the nature of the 3′-terminus, however, revealed

12

a further feature of nsp14-nsp10 activity, i.e. the capacity of the enzyme complex to

13

catalyse incisions further into (closer to the 5′-end) of the substrate. We observed a

14

robust and almost equivalent activity of nsp14-nsp10 on both ssRNA and dsRNA.

15

Related, we did not observe preferential excision of terminally mismatched nucleotides

16

by the CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex, as has been reported for the analogue CoV-1

17

complex3. Instead, therefore, we observed that nsp14-nsp10 is capable of degrading

18

(approximately) the first eight ribonucleotides from the 3′-end of all substrates tested

19

(either ssRNA or dsRNA) in an exonucleolytic fashion. When a 3′-hydroxyl group was

20

not present the nsp14-nsp10 nuclease acted further downstream (5′-to) these sites to

21

endonucleolytically release fragments of 7- to 10-ribonucleotides endonucleolytically.

22

We therefore propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 is more than that of a proof-reader,

23

by the analogy to the 3′-exonuclease present in replicative DNA polymerase

24

complexes11. We propose nsp14-nsp10 might represent a simple replication-repair

25

system potentially capable of removing ribonucleotides from the 3′-end of elongating

26

replicating RNA strand when extension is blocked. It is likely that the activity of the

27

nsp14-nsp10 is constitutively active during viral replication. It is possible that only

28

when replication stalls due to mismatch incorporation or the presence of altered

29

ribonucleotides that cannot be further extended by the polymerase, the nuclease

30

degrades and/or cleaves the elongating strand, so removing the aberration and

31

allowing for re-engagement of the RNA polymerase and resumption of synthesis. It

32

will be important to reconstitute this replication-repair reaction in future studies to test

33

this hypothesis. We note that another key feature of nsp14-nsp10 nuclease activity is

2

its insensitivity to common RNA modifications that are associated with viral evasion

3

(6-methyladenine) or induction (inosine) of innate immune pathways.

4
5

An important question pertains to why we have observed catalytic activities not

6

previously reported in the analyses of CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10. We tentatively propose an

7

explanation based on our experience of working with nsp14-nsp10, namely that the

8

purified complex is exceptionally unstable under frozen storage, even after a period

9

as short as one week. The assays presented here were all performed on nsp14-nsp10

10

that was less than one week old; after this time elapsed, we found that its activity

11

diminished dramatically, and its behaviour altered. It is possible that degradation

12

and/or aggregation both reduces nsp14-nsp10 activity and alters its substrate

13

selectivity. It is notable that the protein concentrations we employed in our assays,

14

and which supported good activity on ssRNA and dsRNA substrates (15 nM), were far

15

lower than those employed in previous studies that reported on the activity of the CoV-

16

1 complex (several hundred nM), consistent with this suggestion3,8.

17
18

Due to the urgency of identifying new drugs and candidate agents that can treat

19

COVID-19, we also performed both an in silico docking screen to identify chemotypes

20

capable of interacting with the metal-containing active site of nsp14, and a focused

21

screen of drugs (approved and in development) that might inhibit nsp14-nsp10. Our

22

docking simulations, employing structural data for the highly homologous Co-V nsp14-

23

nsp10 complex, revealed that both N-hydroxyimide based compounds could

24

potentially interact with the active site magnesium ion. Testing supported this

25

possibility, revealing one compound from a library available to us, A-2 with an IC50 of

26

20.7 ± 0.5 µM. In the limited time available, we were able to generate several chemical

27

variants around this pharmacophore, but none to date out-performed A-2, nor did two

28

related compounds previously developed to inhibit the FEN-1 DNA nuclease26. We

29

expanded

30

hydroxypyrimidone scaffold. Compound B-1 exhibited comparable levels of inhibition

31

to the N-hydroxyimide based compounds, as did the HIV integrase inhibitor,

32

raltegravir, with IC50 values of 32.3 ± 4.5 µM and 24.4 ± 2.7 µM, respectively.

2

Using docking we were able to model binding of A-1,3–5, B-1, and raltegravir to nsp14-

3

nsp10 using with the structure of SARS-Cov-1. In accordance with previous literature,

4

the N-hydroxyimide and hydroxypyrimidone scaffolds chelated the active site

5

magnesium ion of the SARS-Cov nsp14-nsp1024,26, thus providing insight into the

6

possible mode of inhibition. Interestingly, the in silico modelling with raltegravir

7

suggests the larger compound could be accommodated well in the active site pocket,

8

potentially making additional contacts, which has the possibility of being explored

9

and/or exploited in future approaches to generate targeted inhibitors of nsp14-nsp10.

10
11

Our focused screens of drug and drug candidates with predicted potential to interact

12

with or inhibit nucleic acids processing enzymes revealed that the selenium-containing

13

drug ebselen was an effective inhibitor of nsp14-nsp10. It is interesting to note that

14

ebselen was the most potent inhibitor experimentally confirmed inhibitor of the major

15

SARS-Cov-1 protease (Mpro), and the authors demonstrated antiviral activity in cell-

16

based assays30. The potency of ebselen for nsp14-nsp10 and Mpro inhibition are

17

similar in vitro; the IC50 for Mpro was 4.67 µM, and for nsp14-nsp10 we determined an

18

IC50 of 3.3 µM. The mechanism(s) of action of ebselen in nsp14-nsp10 inhibition

19

remains unknown, but given the known role for the selenium in this compound to lead

20

to co-ordination or ejection of zinc atoms in these proteins33-35, we propose this is a

21

possible mode of action. Indeed, zinc fingers are highly represented in the proteome

22

of SARS-CoV-230, where the Mpro possesses zinc binding motifs and the SARS-CoV-

23

1 (and by extension, SARS-CoV-2, due to very high level of sequence conservation)

24

nsp10 possesses at least one zinc finger which is likely to be important for mediating

25

interactions with the RNA viral genome8,10. Interference with these zinc atoms from

26

these binding motifs might induce conformational changes that are not compatible with

27

robust activity. Given that ebselen is capable of targeting two key enzymes required

28

for the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, it is reasonable that further studies assessing the

29

utility of this agent in combatting COVID-19, as a stand-alone agent or in combination,

30

are warranted. More generally, given that many important antimicrobial medicines act

31

by binding to multiple targets (e.g. b-lactams such as penicillin and cephalosporins),

32

we suggest that polypharmacology be pursued as a matter of priority for COVID-19

33

treatment.

METHODS

3

Expression and purification of wildtype and nuclease dead (NSP14D113A/E115A)

4

NSP14-10 complex.

5

The N-terminally His-tagged nsp14-10 protein complex was expressed as a bi-

6

cistronic mRNA in which nsp14 bearing a N-terminal Histidine tag is followed by a

7

ribosome binding site and the untagged nsp10 ORF. The protein was generated by

8

transformation into E. coli BL21 Rosetta2 cells and expression in Terrific Broth media

9

supplemented with 30 µg mL-1 kanamycin and 10 mM ZnCl2. The culture was

10

incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 °C until an OD600 of 2.0 was reached. Cultures

11

were then transferred to an incubator at 18 °C for 30 min before induction with 1 mM

12

Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactoyranoside (IPTG) and incubated for 18 hours with shaking

13

(200 rpm).

14
15

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet

16

was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM

17

imidazole, 5% v/v glycerol and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and lysed

18

by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 g for 30 min, and

19

the supernatant was loaded onto an equilibrated (lysis buffer) immobilised metal

20

affinity chromatography column (IMAC) (Ni-IDA Sepharose, GE healthcare).

21
22

The immobilised protein was washed with lysis buffer and eluted with elution buffer

23

(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 5% v/v glycerol and 1 mM

24

TCEP). The protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialysed overnight at 4 °C

25

in dialysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol, and 1 mM

26

TCEP) supplemented with recombinant tobacco etch virus (rTEV) protease for

27

cleavage of the N-terminal 6xHis tag. The protein was then subjected to a second

28

IMAC step to remove His-tagged rTEV protease, cleaved His tag, and uncleaved His-

29

tagged nsp14-10 complex.

30
31

The cleaved nsp14-10 complex was concentrated to 1 mL using a 50 kDa MWCO

32

centrifugal concentrator. The protein was then further purified on to a Superdex 200

mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol, 2 mM TCEP) at 0.8 mL/min. The purified protein was

3

concentrated to 0.5 mg mL-1 and was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use.

4

Monomeric nsp14 was purified from the same vector under different induction

5

conditions (overnight growth without adding IPTG).

The presence of the nsp14-10 complex was confirmed via SDS-PAGE, and ESI-Q-

8

TOF (electrospray-ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight) mass spectroscopy (MS).

10

Generation of 5′ radiolabelled substrates

11

10 pmol of single-stranded RNA or DNA (Eurofins MWG Operon, Germany) was

12

incubated with 6.8 pmol γ-32P-dATP (Perkin Elmer), and 10 U T4 PNK (ThermoFisher

13

Scientific) at 37 oC for 1 hour. This solution was passed through a P6 Micro Bio- Spin

14

chromatography column (BioRad) to remove unbound label and diluted accordingly in

15

nuclease-free ultrapure H2O.

16
17

For double-stranded structures, radiolabelled RNA or DNA was annealed to unlabeled

18

complementary molecules at a 1:1.5 ratio to give a final concentration of 100 nM in 10

19

mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA by heating the sample to 95 oC

20

for 3 min before cooling to room temperature. A detailed list of all oligonucleotide

21

sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

22
23

Generation of a single nucleotide RNA ladder

24

Nuclease assays

6

Nuclease assays were carried out in 10 μL reactions containing 25 mM HEPES-KOH,

7

pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1.0 mM DTT, 10 nM RNA or DNA

8

substrate and serially diluted two-fold nsp14-nsp10 complex or nsp14 from 500 nM.

9

Reactions were incubated at 37 oC for 45 min, and quenched by the addition of 5 μL

10

stop solution (95% formamide (v/v), 10 mM EDTA, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25%

11

bromophenol blue) and boiling at 95 oC for 3 min.

12
13

Reactions were then analysed by 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

14

(40% solution of 19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide, BioRad) and 7 M urea (Sigma

15

Aldrich)) in 1 x TBE (Tris-borate EDTA) buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out at 525

16

V for 1.5 hours; gels were subsequently fixed for 60 min in fixing solution (50%

17

methanol, 10% acetic acid), and dried at 80 oC for two hours under a vacuum. The

18

dried gels were exposed to a Kodak phosphorimager screen and scanned using a

19

Typhoon 9400 instrument (GE).

20
21

Where applicable, gel-based nuclease assays were quantified by analysing the

22

product formation (digestion) of the radiolabelled RNA substrate(s). Gel images

23

collected on a Typhoon scanner were analysed in Image J to determine the amount

24

of substrate remaining in the well (undigested) in comparison to the amount of

25

substrate that entered the gel (product) reported as a percent digested. This was

26

plotted versus protein concentration to indicate digestion rate. Error is standard error.

27

Three or more gels were analysed for each substrate.

Nuclease inhibition assays

30

Inhibitor exonuclease assays were carried out in 10 μL volumes containing 25 mM

31

HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1.0 mM DTT and 100

32

33

reaction in the above buffer. Inhibitors were serially diluted two-fold from 100 μM and

were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with the nsp14-10 complex, before the

4

reactions were initiated by the addition of RNA substrate (10 nM), incubated at 37 oC

5

for 45 min, then quenched by the addition of 5 μL stop solution (95% formamide, 10

6

mM EDTA, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromophenol blue) and boiling at 95 oC for 3

Molecular docking

11

The structure of the best available SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10 entry in the Protein Data

12

Bank (PDB), PDB ID 5NFY with a resolution of 3.38 Å10, were aligned with another

13

SARS-CoV-1 nsp14-nsp10 structure (PDB: 5C8U, resolution 3.40 Å8) to incorporate

14

the missing active site Mg2+ in 5NFY from that in 5C8U. The coordinates were then

15

translated such that the centre of mass was closer to the origin, (0,0,0), and prepared

16

for docking with AutoDockTools. Blind docking was carried out using AutoDock Vina

17

using a grid box of 64 Å x 70 Å x 126 Å centred on (-0.476, 5.300, 8.298),

18

encompassing the entire protein surface. A second set of more focused dockings was

19

performed with AutoDock Vina focused on the active site, with the grid box specified

20

to be 30 Å x 24 Å x 24 Å centred on (-5.196, -9.373, -7.837). Predicted AutoDock Vina

21

affinities of each docked binding mode for each ligand were extracted, along with the

22

distance from the centre of the binding mode to the catalytic Mg2+, and to the centre

23

of mass of GpppA in the MTase binding site. Docked poses were analysed using

24

PyMOL and rendered with ChimeraX.

‘nuclease-dead’ complex bearing Ala-substitutions at D113 and E115 (nsp14D113A,E115Ansp10) showing the purity of the purified proteins. Predicted molecular weights are 59 463
Da for nsp14 and 15 281 Da for nsp10.
(b) Nsp14-nsp10 is an RNase that digests a 20-mer ssRNA oligo (oligo 2 as indicated in Suppl.
Table 1A) in a single-nucleotide fashion from the 3’-end terminating at the 8th ribonucleotide
from the 3’-end (labelled *); it further incises closer to the 5’-end to generate 10-mer and 7mer products (labelled ** and *** respectively). Nsp14 alone can generate the 12-mer and
10-mer products, but when using significantly higher protein concentrations. The predicted
nuclease-dead nsp14D113A,E115A-nsp10 mutant complex exhibits no discernible nuclease
activity, even at ten-fold higher concentrations compared with the wildtype complex.
Increasing concentrations of protein (as indicated) were incubated with substrate at 37oC for
45 min and reactions were subsequently analysed by 20% denaturing PAGE to visualize
product formation. Size of products was determined as shown in Suppl. Fig 1D. Main
products are labelled *, ** and *** corresponding to 12-mer, 10-mer and 7-mer respectively.

Figure 2: Nsp14-nsp10 is a versatile RNA nuclease.
(a) Nsp14-nsp10 nuclease activity is not sequence specific. The complex shows
indistinguishable digestion patterns on two 20-mer ssRNA substrates of mixed sequence and
containing all four bases. Oligos 2 and 3 were used, respectively (see Suppl. Table 1A).
(b) When presented with 20-mer Poly(U) and Poly(A) ssRNA (oligos 13 and 14 respectively;
Suppl. Table 1A), nsp14-nsp10 shows reduced and qualitatively altered activity, with a single
nucleotide step-wise digestion from the 3’-end curtailing at the 9th-11th nucleotide from the 3’end.
(c) Nsp14-nsp10 processes ssRNA, the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA hybrid, and dsRNA with no
preference for double-stranded substrates. For all structures, the labelled strand is oligo 2,
also used in Fig. 1b (see Suppl. Table 1A and B).
(d) Product formation (%) was quantified for Fig. 2 C comparing nsp14-nsp10 nuclease activity
on ssRNA, the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA hybrid and dsRNA as outlined in Methods and
Materials. All data are shown as mean ± s.e.m, and at least three biological replicates were
used for each substrate. Nsp14-nsp10 shows equivalent activity on ssRNA and the RNA
strand of an RNA:DNA hybrid with a slight decrease in activity for dsRNA.
Increasing concentrations of protein (as indicated) were incubated with substrate at 37oC for 45 min;
reactions were subsequently analysed by 20% denaturing PAGE to visualize product formation. The
s of products was determined as shown in Suppl. Fig 1D. Main products are labelled *, ** and ***

Figure 3: Nsp14-nsp10 of Sars-CoV-2 exhibits both 3’-exonuclease activity and a newlydescribed endonucleolytic activity that reaches beyond the classical role of a proofreading
nuclease.
(a) Nsp14-nsp10 is an RNA exo- and endo- nuclease. With a substrate containing a 3´-biotin
group, the characteristic laddering of the substrate is lost and only endonucleolytic cleavage
at the positions furthest from the 3´-end is observed. Substrates with a 3´-hydroxyl or
phosphate group, exhibit near identical product profiles.
(b) Nsp14-nsp10 is an exo- and endo- nuclease able to incise a variety of RNA substrates,
including RNA substrates with mismatched termini and flaps with no preference for
mismatched ribonucleotides. Quantification in suppl. Fig. 3B (mm: mismatch, int. mm:
internal mismatch).
Increasing concentrations of protein (as indicated) were incubated with substrate at 37oC for 45 min;
reactions were subsequently analysed by 20% denaturing PAGE to visualize product formation. Size
of products was determined as shown in Suppl. Fig 1D. Main products are labelled *, ** and ***
corresponding to 12-mer, 10-mer and 7-mer respectively. All oligos used are indicated in Suppl. table
1A and B.

Suppl. Figure 1: Nsp14-nsp10 is an RNA nuclease with a complex digestion pattern.
(a) Size exclusion chromatogram for nsp14 alone, wild-type nsp14-nsp10 (designated nsp14nsp10), and a control ‘nuclease-dead’ complex bearing alanine substitutions at residues D113
and E115 (nsp14D113A,E115A-nsp10). Traces of Superdex 200 16/60 runs are shown for Nsp14
alone and wild-type nsp14-nsp10 and trace of Superdex increase 10/300 run for the ‘nucleasedead’ complex. Wild-type nsp14-nsp10 complex elutes in a single peak at ~82.5 mL, Nsp14
alone at ~84.3 mL and ‘nuclease-dead’ complex at ~14.6 mL . SDS-PAGE analysis of the
fraction across the peak confirms the presence of both nsp14 and nsp10 in fractions D1–D8
(see Suppl. Fig. 1e).
(b) Intact mass spectrometry analysis of nsp14 alone, wild-type nsp14-nsp10 (designated nsp14nsp10) and a control ‘nuclease-dead’ complex bearing substitutions at residues D113 and E115
(nsp14D113A,E115A-nsp10). LC-MS chromatogram shows the observed mass of all proteins is
within range of the calculated mass.
(c) Nsp14-nsp10 digests 20-mer and a 30-mer ssRNA substrates, but not a 10-mer ssRNA.
(d) Nsp14-nsp10 is an RNA nuclease manifests a complex digestion pattern, digesting from the 3’
end in a single-nucleotide fashion until the 8th ribonucleotide, then cleaving at the 10th and 13th
ribonucleotide. A single nucleotide ladder was used to determine the size of the released
products.
(e) SDS-PAGE of the fractions before, during and after the peak used from gel filtration for wildtype nsp14-nsp10. The elution peak (D1–D8) coincides precisely with the characteristic RNAse
activity that we observe in our activity gel. The predicted molecular weight is 59 463 Da for
nsp14 and 15 281 Da for nsp10. Increasing concentrations of protein (as indicated) were
incubated with substrate at 37oC for 45 min, reactions were subsequently analysed by 20%
denaturing PAGE to visualize product formation. The size of products was determined as shown
in Suppl. Fig 1D. Main products are labelled *, ** and *** corresponding to 12-mer, 10-mer and
7-mer respectively. All oligos used are indicated in Suppl. table 1A and B. For Suppl. Figs. 1D
and E, oligo 2 was used.

Suppl. Figure 2: Nsp14-nsp10 is metal-ion dependent RNA nuclease.
(a) Nsp14-nsp10 activity is enhanced by the addition of both MgCl2 and MnCl2, but is inhibited
by ZnCl2. We determined 5 mM MgCl2 as optimal for activity.
(b) Consistent with its requirement for metal ions, nsp14-nsp10 activity is inhibited by the
addition of metal ion chelators EDTA, EGTA, and ο-phenanthroline, with a particular
sensitivity towards EDTA.
125 nM or 250 nM of protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of ions or chelators (as
indicated) on ice for 15 min before adding substrate and incubating the reaction at 37oC for 45 min.
Reactions were subsequently analysed by 20% denaturing PAGE to visualize product formation.
For Suppl. Figs. 2A and B, oligo 2 was used.

Suppl. Figure 3: Nsp14-nsp10 activity is specific to RNA only and is able to process common
chemical modifications on RNA.
(a) Nsp14-nsp10 has no discernible nuclease activity on ssDNA or the DNA strand of an
DNA:RNA hybrid. Interestingly, the complex is able to incise around an embedded
ribonucleotide in a ssDNA oligo at concentrations above 125 nM.
(b) Product formation (%) was quantified for Fig. 3 B comparing nsp14-nsp10 nuclease activity
on dsRNA and RNA substrates containing termini and internal mismatches as outlined in
Methods and Materials. All data are shown as mean ± s.e.m, and at least three biological
replicates were used for each substrate. Nsp14-nsp10 shows no preference for mismatched
oligonucleotides compared to dsRNA.

(c) Nsp14-nsp10 is able process common chemical modifications of RNA, namely 2methyladenine (m2A), 6-methyladenine (m6A) and inosine (I), both ssRNA and dsRNA with
no apparent change compared to ssRNA or dsRNA.
Increasing concentrations of protein (as indicated) were incubated with substrate at 37oC for

Suppl. Figure 4: Molecular docking of SARS-CoV nsp14-nsp10 using Autodock
(a)&(b) Nsp14-nsp10 was docked with compounds within a grid box encompassing a surface
focussed on the active. The calculated affinities of all binding modes are shown for each
compound. Compounds are grouped based on their function groups (a), and by predicted
inhibition activity (b); the dashed line describes the median of affinities for all compounds.
(c) Nsp14-nsp10 was docked with compounds within a grid box encompassing the full surface.
The affinities of binding modes were calculated for each compound and grouped based on
predicted ???activities. The colouring reflects the location of binding mode on the structure of
nsp14-nsp10; dashed line describes the median of affinities in this cohort.
(d) The positions of highest-affinity docked poses as a function of the distance from the active
site ExoN Mg2+ centre and the distance from the MTase substrate (GpppA) binding site.
(e) Three representatives of predicted inhibitor binding locations on nsp14-nsp10 are shown: + (i)
nsp-10 Zn site (disulfiram, purple), ExoN Mg2) (etoposide, salmon), and the MTase substrate

Suppl. Figure 5: Inhibition profile curves generated from gel-based nuclease assay data with
the indicated compounds
Inhibition profile curves were calculated by quantification of gel-based nuclease assay data as
outlined in Methods and Materials. A decrease in the ‘% digested’ of the substrate represents an
increase in inhibition. Data were plotted against log10 of [inhibitor] and dose response curves were
generated using non-linear regression. Where possible IC50 values were obtained. All data are shown
as mean ± sem; t least three biological replicates were used for each compound. In some cases an
IC50 value was unable to be calculated, either due to incomplete inhibition, or the inability to fit a
sigmoidal curve to the data.

Suppl. Figure 7: The N-hydroxyimide-based compounds, A-1, AZ1353160 and AZ13623940
(AZ-B1), exhibit limited inhibition of nsp14-nsp10
Increasing concentrations (as indicated, in μM) of indicated compounds were incubated with 100 nM
nsp14-nsp10 for 10 minutes at room temperature, before starting a standard nuclease assay reaction
by the addition of ssRNA, incubating at 37oC for 45 min. Reaction products were analysed by 20%
denaturing PAGE. A decrease in the generation of nucleolytic reaction products and a concomitant
increase in undigested substrate indicates inhibition of nuclease activity at increasing inhibitor
concentrations. - indicates no enzyme.

(a) ΔTm of nsp14-nsp10 with drugs and drug-like compounds. Of all the compounds tested, only
aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a known pan-nuclease inhibitor appears to aggregate the
protein at high concentration (100 µM and 50 µM).
(b) ΔTm of nsp14-nsp10 with N-hydroxyimide compounds
Samples were heated from 25–95°C in 1°C per minute increments. Fluorescence intensities were
plotted as a function of temperature to generate a sigmoidal curve with the inflection point of the
transition curve indicating the melting temperature (Tm) of the protein. The Tm of nsp14-nsp10
is around 47°C. The ΔTm for each of the compound dilutions are shown as inset table. See Suppl.
Materials and Methods for more detail.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cloning and site directed mutagenesis of wildtype and nuclease dead (NSP14
D113A/E115A)

NSP14-10 complex.

Wildtype (WT) NSP14 and NSP10 encoding DNA were codon-optimised for
Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression and were synthesised by Twist Bioscience
(California, USA). Both the NSP14 and NSP10 genes were subcloned into the
pNIC28-BSA4 vector1 to enable bicistronic expression

and appropriately

stoichiometric production of NSP14 and NSP10 proteins.

Site-directed-mutagenesis (SDM) was carried out using an ‘inverse’ PCR experiment,
whereby an entire plasmid is amplified using complementary mutagenic primers with
minimal cloning steps2. The Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (Agilent) was
utilised and SDM PCR was performed to amplify the whole plasmid, according to the
manufacturers instructions. The PCR product was then added to a standard KLD
enzyme mix (NEB) reaction and was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, prior
to transformation into chemically competent E. coli cells.

Compound synthesis
All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Fluka, Fluorochem, Abcr, or
Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. Flash column chromatography
was performed using a Biotage Isolera automated flash column chromatography
platform using Biotage KP-SNAP-Sil or SNAP Ultra columns. IR spectra were
recorded using a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer in the solid state or as a thin
film. Selected characteristic peaks are reported in cm–1. NMR spectra were recorded
using Bruker Avance spectrometers in the deuterated solvent stated. Assignments
given correspond with the numbering system as drawn; where assignments are not
given it was not possible to assign the resonances due to overlapping signals. Lowresolution mass spectra were recorded using an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity
LC-MS system fitted with a 6120 Quadrupole mass spectrometer.
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded in HPLC grade methanol using
electrospray ionisation (ESI+) on a Bruker APEX III FT-ICR mass spectrometer.

Dose-response inhibition and data analysis
Approximate IC50 values were calculated (where possible) by analysing the inhibition
of digestion of a radiolabelled RNA substrate. Gel images collected on a Typhoon
scanner were analysed using Image J (NIH)7, determining the proportion of substrate
remaining undigested (enzyme control) in comparison with the amount of that entered
the gel; results are given as a percentage of digested substrate and were plotted
against the log10 of the inhibitor concentration, dose response curves were fitted using
nonlinear regression, and where possible IC50 values calculated. The data were
plotted and IC50 values obtained in Graphpad Prism v8.3.0. Error is standard error.

Three or more gels were analysed for each inhibitor. Some data was excluded due to
user determined factors such as: the quality of the gel being insufficient to obtain
satisfactory data (e.g. gel cracked during drying), the signal of the radiation was below
a minimum threshold, or the controls run on the gel were of unsatisfactory quality (e.g.
bands running in a non-horizontal, or “smiling” format).

Differential scanning spectrometry (DSF)
DSF experiments were carried out using the method of Niesen et al8. Each of the
compounds were serially diluted in DSF buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Note that DTT was excluded for

experiments with thiram, disulfiram, and ebselen. The nsp14-10 complex (1 µM) was
incubated in the presence of the compounds for 10 minutes at room temperature prior
to the addition of SYPROTM Orange protein stain (1:10000 dilution). The fluorescence
emission was measured using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer filter (560–
580 nm) with an excitation wavelength of 450–490 nm. During the DSF experiment,
the temperature was increased from 25 to 95°C at an increment of 1°C per second.
