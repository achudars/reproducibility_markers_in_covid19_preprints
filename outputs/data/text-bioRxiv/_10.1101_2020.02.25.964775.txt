Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is newly emerging human infectious diseases, which is caused by Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV). Within two
months of the outbreak, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide. Since the human
to human transmission occurred easily and the human infection is rapidly increasing, the sensitive and early
diagnosis is essential to prevent the global outbreak. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) announced
various primer and probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 previously developed in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan,
Thailand, and USA. In this study, we compared the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the seven primerprobe sets for N gene and the three primer-probe sets for Orf1 gene. The result of the comparative analysis
represented that the ‘2019-nCoV_N2, N3’ of USA and the ‘ORF1ab’ of China are the most sensitive primer-probe
sets for N and Orf1 genes, respectively. Therefore, the appropriate combination from ORF1ab (China), 2019nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets should be selected for the sensitive and reliable
laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Firstly informed to World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019, the current outbreak of Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19) involves 78,811 confirmed cases over 28 countries as of 23 February 2020 [1]. The majority
of COVID-19 patients had pneumonia and showed symptoms include fever and cough [2, 3]. The genome
sequence of causative novel coronavirus was shared through Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) platform from 12 January 2020. The sequences of novel coronavirus (CoV) showed close similarity to
that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and the virus uses ACE2 as the
entry receptor like SARS-CoV [4-6]. The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses designated the virus as SARS-CoV-2 [7].
Molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently carried out by one-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
targetting SARS-CoV-2 by which primers and probes being suggested by institutes of China, Germany, Hong
Kong, Japan, Thailand, and USA were posted through WHO [8-10]. Clinical diagnosis methods including CT scan
are also utilized to identify COVID-19 cases in Hubei province, China, from 13 February 2020 [11]. Although
qRT-PCR assay served as a gold-standard method to detect respiratory infectious viruses such as SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV [12-15], current qRT-PCR assays targetting SARS-CoV-2 have some caveats. First, due to the high
similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV, primer-probe sets would cross-react. Second, the sensitivity of the
assays may not enough to confirm suspicious patients in early time points after admission. Indeed, cases of positive
CT scan results and negative RT-PCR results at initial presentation were reported [16]. The performance of
molecular diagnosis might be dependent on primers, probes, and reagents. There have been no comparative results
of the current qRT-PCR analysis for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.
In this present study, the qRT-PCR analysis was performed with previously reported primer-probe sets
targeting RdRp/Orf1 and N region of SARS-CoV-2. This is the first comparative analysis of various primer-probe
sets for the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and methods
Primer Information of qPCR
For the comparative analysis of laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2, ten primer-probe sets were selected
based on sequence information from the six different national institutions; the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) (USA), Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin Institute of Virology (Germany), The University
of Hong Kong (Hong Kong), National Institute of Infectious Disease, Department of virology Ⅲ (Japan), China
CDC (China), and National Institute of Health (Thailand). All of the DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized from
Neoprobe (Daejeon, South Korea). The sequences of primer-probe sets and their locations at viral RNA (GenBank
MN908947.3) were listed in Figure 1 and Table 1. Seven of the ten sets were derived from the N gene, and the
other three sets were derived from Orf1 gene (RdRp, ORF 1b-Nsp14, and ORF 1-Nsp10). All DNA
oligonucleotides were resuspended in nuclease-free water before use.

Viral RNA preparation
The infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory. African green monkey

SARS-CoV-2

(BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020 provided from Korea CDC). After 72 h, the culture medium containing mature
infectious virions (virus medium) was collected and viral RNA was isolated from the culture medium using the
QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Preparation of in vitro transcribed RNA standard
The coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein, which cloned in pET21a plasmid was PCR amplified
with T7 promoter primer (5’ – AATACGACTCACTATAG – 3’, Macrogen Inc., South Korea) and T7 terminator
primer (5’ – GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG – 3’, Macrogen) with AccuPower® PCR PreMix (-dye) kit (Bioneer
Inc., South Korea). PCR product was then used as in vitro transcription template using MEGAscript™ T7
Transcription Kit (Invitrogen Inc., CA, USA). The copy number of in vitro transcribed RNA was calculated from

RNA concentration measured with Quantus™ Fluorometer (Promega Inc., WI, USA). Standardized amounts of
in vitro produced RNA were used E primer and qRT-PCR to produce a standard curve.

Confirmatory qRT-PCR in RdRp and N
Extracted nucleic acid samples were tested for comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The Orf1 and
N region of SARS-CoV-2 were used as the target sequences for SARS-CoV-2 specific gene. Briefly, 10 μL of
purified viral RNA was amplified in a 20 μL reaction solution containing 1X 1 step RT-PCR mix (WELLS BIO
INC., South Korea), and 300 nM of primers and probes for the target detection. The qRT-PCR was performed
with a CFX 96 touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The qRT-PCR conditions
applied in this study were programmed as follows: UNG incubation, RT incubation, and enzyme activation were
serially performed at 25 °C for 2 minutes, at 55 °C for 10 minutes, at 94 °C for 3 minutes respectively. Thermal
cycling was then performed at 94 °C for 15 seconds (denaturation), and at 60 °C for 30 seconds (annealing and
amplification) for forty-five cycles.

Results and Discussion
Validation of qRT-PCR assay
The Ct value was not produced from negative control, indicating the reaction was done aseptically. The standard
curve from E gene primer-probe set also showed the reaction was done accordingly. The R2 value of the standard
curve was 0.999 and the calculated amplification efficiency was 101.6%. These indicated that the qRT-PCR
reaction was done in optimal condition. The viral concentration of supernatant and cell lysate was determined by
E gene-based assay (Table 2).

RdRp/Orf1 Assays
The Ct value of RdRp_SARSr (Germany), HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) from low
concentration (15 copies/reaction) were 43.00, 38.97, and 36.85, respectively (Table 2). The assay with
RdRp_SARSr (Germany) set showed a positive signal from the single reaction of triplicate in the concentration of
15 copies/reaction. The assay with HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) sets showed positive
signals in the concentration of 1.5 copies/reaction (data not shown). The R2 value from RdRp_SARSr (Germany),
HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) were 0.983, 0.997 and 0.997, respectively. The calculated
amplification efficiency of RdRp_SARSr (Germany), HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China)
was 101.6%, 96.1%, and 109.8%, respectively. As a result, ORF1ab (China) set may be recommended for the
laboratory confirmation of the RdRp/Orf1 gene.

N Assays
The Ct value of N (China), HKU-N (Hong Kong), NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan), WH-NIC N (Thailand), 2019nCoV_N1, N2, and N3 (USA) from low concentration (15 copies/reaction) were 34.86, 35.43, 33.13, 38.13, 34.71,
33.14, and 33.09, respectively (Table 2). The Ct value of 2019-nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N
(Japan) sets were similar to each other, and the sets could be regarded as the most sensitive sets. The moderately
sensitive assay was based on 2019-nCoV_N1 (USA) and N (China). These sets had higher Ct value than the most

sensitive sets, however, the Ct values from low concentration (15 copies/μl) were still within the cut-off value (Ct
<37). WH-NIC N (Thailand) set was less sensitive than other sets. The Ct value from low concentration (15
copies/μl) was close to the cut-off value (Ct <38). The R2 value from of N (China), HKU-N (Hong Kong),

NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan), WH-NIC N (Thailand), 2019-nCoV_N1, N2, and N3 (USA) were 0.989,
0.980, 0.987, 0.987, 0.986, 0.952, and 0.991, respectively. The calculated amplification efficiency of N
(China), HKU-N (Hong Kong), NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan), WH-NIC N (Thailand), 2019-nCoV_N1,
N2, and N3 (USA) were 89.4, 105.3, 100.7, 106.2, 95.2, 97.3, and 93.9, respectively. Therefore, 2019nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets should be beneficial for the laboratory confirmation
of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR assay of N gene.

Conclusions
Various primer-probe sets were previously reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 by the qRT-PCR assay. The sensitivity
of the assay may not enough to confirm suspicious patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Nevertheless, there have been no comparative results of the current qRT-PCR analysis for the molecular diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, the first comparative analysis of various primer-probe sets targeting
RdRp/Orf1 and N region of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by qRT-PCR for the laboratory confirmation. In the
case of targeting RdRp/Orf1 region, ORF1ab (China) set might be the most sensitive than other sets. 2019nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets may be recommended for the sensitive qRT-PCR
assay of N region. Therefore, the appropriate combination from ORF1ab (China), 2019-nCoV_N2, N3 (USA),
and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets should be selected for the sensitive and reliable laboratory confirmation of
SARS-CoV-2.
