Animal models recapitulating human COVID-19 disease, especially with severe disease, are
urgently needed to understand pathogenesis and evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics.
Here, we develop novel severe disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of
adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2
knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by the respiratory route. Both the CyPtreated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in
immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only).
Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in RAG2
KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and
found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection. Our results
suggest that functional B and/or T cells are not only important for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2,
but also play an early role in protection from acute disease.

The ongoing pandemic has led to the search for animal models faithfully recapitulating salient
features of human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for pathogenesis studies and evaluation of
vaccines and therapeutics (1). Early reports indicated that Syrian hamsters, whose ACE2 is
highly homologous to its human ortholog, were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but
did not develop severe disease (2, 3). In 2008, administration of cyclophosphamide (CyP), an
alkylating agent that suppresses B and T cell function, was used to develop a severe disease
model for SARS-CoV in Syrian hamsters (4). We reasoned that a similar approach might allow
the development of a severe disease model for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, clinical findings of
lymphopenia associated with COVID-19 (5) and its prominence in severe cases (6, 7) suggested
an immunosuppressed animal model of COVID-19 might more accurately model some aspects
of human disease. Here, we used CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters to investigate how
transient disruption, or ablation, of the adaptive immune response affects SARS-CoV-2
infection. In addition, we used the immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hamster models to
evaluate whether pre-exposure to virus through previous infection, or neutralizing antibodies,
were sufficient to limit or prevent disease.
Transient immunosuppression using CyP increased duration and severity of disease in
SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters.

Wild-type hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop weight loss of
approximately 10% 6 days post-infection (dpi) following a 100,000 plaque forming units (PFU)
intranasal challenge dose (2). We confirmed this using both a 10,000 and 100,000 PFU dose
(Fig. S1A). The maximum weight loss of each hamster was plotted for both a 10,000 and
100,000 PFU challenge dose demonstrating the high variability of wild-type hamsters in
responses to virus infection with coefficients of variation of 57% and 48%, respectively (Fig.
S1B). These hamsters developed a robust neutralizing antibody responses as measured by plaque
reduction neutralization test (PRNT80) and virus genome was cleared 11 dpi, as measured by
pharyngeal swab real time (RT)-PCR (Fig. S1C,D).
In our first experiment manipulating the adaptive immune response, we immunosuppressed
hamsters using CyP (CyP-Tx) beginning -3 dpi. Suppression of lymphocytes was confirmed by
hematology analysis just prior to challenge (Fig. 1A). On Day 0, groups of 10 hamsters were
exposed to 100, 1,000, or 10,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route. Disease
progression was monitored by weight loss (Fig. 1B) and detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal
swab using RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). Weight loss was remarkably similar between all SARS-CoV-2
exposed groups regardless of dose, with drastic weight loss beginning 6 dpi. Weight loss
remained significant relative to starting weight through 35 dpi (Table S1). In contrast, mock
(PBS) challenged hamsters treated with CyP steadily gained weight with a few exceptions (Fig.
S1C). Specifically, one cage of four mock challenged hamsters showed evidence of weight loss
9-12 dpi (Fig S2). These same animals were the only mock challenged hamsters that were
positive in the SARS-CoV-2 pharyngeal swab RT-PCR analysis starting 9 dpi (Fig 1C and Fig
S1C).
All of the SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters had detectable viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs at
the first time point assayed, 3 dpi, and remained consistent (103-105 molecules of N2 per 100ng
RNA) through the duration of CyP treatment (Fig 1C). After the last CyP treatment on 21 dpi,
most of the hamsters continued to lose weight and several hamsters began to exhibit signs of a

wasting disease, i.e. cachexia and extreme weight loss, requiring euthanasia (Fig. 1B,D). Then,
approximately 7 days after cessation of CyP the remaining hamsters started gaining weight and
viral RNA levels in pharyngeal swabs dropped below 103 molecules of N per 100 ng RNA (Fig.
1C). Viral RNA was detected in lung tissue from a subset of hamsters collected13 dpi, the day
of euthanasia of moribund animals (14-34 dpi), or euthanasia 35 dpi (end of study, Fig. 1E).
There was a statistically significant reduction in lung viral burden comparing 35 dpi to 13 dpi
lung homogenates. Serum collected from surviving hamsters 35 dpi was assayed for neutralizing
antibodies (Fig. 1F). Six of the ten infected hamsters that survived in the CyP
immunosuppression experiment never developed detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies.
Interestingly, the four hamsters that did develop neutralizing antibodies after CyP treatment
cessation rebounded more rapidly as measured by weight gain (Fig. S3). Together these data
indicate that CyP treatment allowed a persistent infection that was reversed, in most animals,
when CyP treatment was stopped and the adaptive immune response allowed to recover.
A second experiment was conducted to determine if a 3-day interval of CyP treatment might lead
to even more dramatic weight loss than the 4-day interval. The last day of CyP treatment was 9
dpi rather than 21 dpi. Comparing the weights of ten hamsters treated with CyP at 3-day versus
4-day intervals revealed almost identical kinetics of weight loss (Fig. S4A). The cessation of
CyP treatment9 dpi allowed more rapid recovery from weight loss. CyP treatment at 3-day
intervals increased the amount of viral RNA detected by pharyngeal swab RT-PCR by
approximately 1 order of magnitude relative to the 4-day interval between 3 and 7 dpi (Fig.
S4B). The apparent increase level of virus did not result in increased weight loss or lethality.
Based on these findings, we decided to use a 1,000 PFU intranasal dose and Cyp at a 4-day
interval stopping 9 dpi for future antibody passive transfer experiments.
RAG2 KO hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 results in a lethal model
RAG2 KO hamsters deficient in recombination activation gene 2 do not produce functional T or
B cells (8). Whereas CyP treatment allowed transient and partial immunosuppression, the RAG2
KO hamsters allowed us to evaluate the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of
functional lymphocytes. RAG2 KO hamsters were exposed to 10,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2 by the
intranasal route. The RAG2 KO hamsters showed significant weight loss starting 3 dpi (Fig. 2A)
and the infection was uniformly lethal with a median day-to-death of 6 days (p=0.0025, Log-rank
test, Fig. 2B). Viral RNA detected from pharyngeal swabs trended to be higher than the CyPtreated hamsters, but not statistically significant (Fig. 2C). The 10,000 PFU and PBS mock
groups from the CyP experiment shown in Fig. 1 were included in Fig. 2A-C for comparison.
Organs from the RAG2 KO animals that succumbed or met euthanasia criteria were
homogenized and evaluated for viral RNA by RT-PCR. Viral RNA was present at the highest
levels in the lung and trachea. Lower levels of viral RNA were also detected in extrapulmonary
organs including the heart, liver, spleen, intestine, brain and kidney (Fig. 2D).
Increased pathology of SARS-CoV-2-infected RAG2 KO hamsters includes hemorrhage
and severe edema
A subset of the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters from the CyP experiment shown in Fig. 1 were
euthanized 13 dpi. Lungs and nasal turbinates were formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, and

evaluated by histopathology and in situ hybridization (ISH) (Fig. 3, Fig. S5). Lung tissue from
necropsied animals demonstrated focally extensive areas consolidation of pulmonary
parenchyma admixed with dense aggregates of inflammatory cells (Fig. 3A). The bronchial
lumina are multi-focally lined by hyperplastic respiratory epithelium (Fig. 3B) and SARS-CoV-2
genomic RNA was frequently detected in alveolar pneumocytes, alveolar infiltrates, and
bronchiolar epithelial cells by ISH (Fig. 3C). At 14 dpi, immunocompetent hamsters infected
with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited only mild congestion and inflammatory infiltration indicating
recovery from viral challenge (2) supporting the hypothesis that CyP administration to disrupt
adaptive immunity exacerbates and prolongs disease in hamsters.
Lung tissue collected at the time of death of SARS-CoV-2-infected RAG2 KO hamsters contain
areas of hemorrhage and inflammation expanding the interstitium and connective tissue
surrounding bronchi and arteries (Fig. 3D). As seen in the CyP-treated hamsters, the bronchial
lumina of RAG2 KO hamsters is lined with multiple layers of infected epithelial and club cells,
containing infiltrates of lymphocytes (presumably nonfunctional), heterophils and macrophages
(Fig. 3E,G,H). There is hemorrhage within alveolar lumen and consolidation with septal
congestion. Also as observed in CyP-treated hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and viral
antigen were frequently detected in alveolar pneumocytes (Fig. 3I), alveolar infiltrates, and
bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 3F). Together these data indicate that the absence of functional
B and T cells in RAG2 KO hamsters allows increased pathology and lethality from SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Electron microscopy studies were performed on lung sections of SARS-CoV-2 infected, CyPtreated hamsters with varying lung viral loads (Fig. 1). The lungs lack a typical morphology
wherein distinct alveolar, inter-alveolar septum with capillaries, Type I and Type II pneumocytes
are clearly evident. The animal with the least viral load (106 molecules of N2 per 100ng RNA,
Fig. 3J) show some remnants of normal architecture while the animal with the highest viral load
(108 molecules of N2 per 100ng RNA, Fig. 3L) lack the prominent alveolar space and were
congested with immune cells. The lamellar bodies in the Type II pneumocytes are still
identifiable in hamsters with high viral loads.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to range in diameter from 50-160nm (with surface spikes measuring
approximately 20nm) (9-13). The low and high viral load samples show compartmentalized
vacuoles with round virus-like structure and vesicles with irregular shaped structures, resembling
multi-vesicular bodies (Fig. 3J-L). The more electron dense vesicles are suggestive of mature
virus particles whereas, the less electron dense particles are likely immature virions. In addition
to cytoplasmic vacuoles, these tissue show swollen rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER, Fig. 3L).
Swollen rER appears as a result of cellular stress and/or increased viral protein synthesis.
Immuno-gold labeling is necessary to confirm the presence of virus particles.
Tracheas from the same SARS-CoV-2 infected, CyP-treated hamsters with varying lung viral
loads were analyzed by electron microscopy. These tracheas also exhibit disruption of the
epithelial layer. Trachea from the animal with the lowest lung viral load (106 molecules of N2
per 100ng RNA) showed mostly intact ciliated cells on the surface (Fig. 4A). These cells show
several cytoplasmic vacuoles with potential immature virus particles (Fig. 4D,E). As lung viral
load increases, the presence of ciliated cells and epithelial cells lining the tracheal lumen
decrease (Fig. 4B-C, respectively). Very few ciliated cells were seen in the animals with the
heaviest viral load (108 molecules of N2 per 100ng RNA) and there is an absence of cytoplasmic
content marked by the lack of electron dense cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 4F).

Protective efficacy of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection

Nine previously infected immunocompetent hamsters from two separate experiments were
retained for a re-challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Our goal was to determine if prior infection
elicited protective immunity. To ensure that these hamsters had cleared infectious virus after the
initial challenge, hamsters were treated with 3 doses of CyP and weights monitored for 14 days
(Fig. 5A). If the animals were persistently infected, we predicted that hamsters would experience
onset of disease as measured by rapid weight loss and positive pharyngeal swab RT-PCR
following CyP administration. No significant weight loss was detected and swabs were negative
for viral RNA (Fig. 5A). All nine animals were positive for neutralizing antibodies prior to the
re-challenge (Fig. 5B). The nine previously exposed hamsters and seven naïve hamsters were
challenged with 100,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2. Weights were monitored daily and pharyngeal
swabs were collected every other day for viral RNA RT-PCR. Control animals lost weight as
predicted whereas the previously exposed animals were protected from significant weight loss.
Pharyngeal swab RT-PCR indicated a statistically significant reduction in viral RNA detected in
re-challenged animals compared to naïve animals (Fig. 5C, Table S3). In addition, viral load in
lung homogenates from animals euthanized at the end of the study indicated a statistically
significant (p=0.0164, unpaired t test) reduction in viral RNA level in the re-challenged animals
Fig. 5D). These data indicate that immunocompetent hamsters recovered from prior exposure to
the SARS-CoV-2 does not result in persistent infection, but instead elicits protective immunity.
Protective efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb

A human monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated
in a passive transfer experiment using immunosuppressed hamster. Thirty mg/kg of Centi-F1
mAb (IC50= 391 ng/mL, PRNT80=1280), a control IgG (normal) mAb, or PBS were
administered -1 dpi. On Day 0 the immunosuppressed animals were challenged with 1,000 PFU
SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing antibody levels in sera at the time of challenge were measured by
PRNT80 (Fig. 6A). Detectable levels ranging from 80 to ≥640 were found in the Centi-F1 mAb
group. Disease progression was monitored by weight change (Fig. 6B) and pharyngeal swab RTPCR (Fig. 6C). Hamsters administered the normal mAb or PBS exhibited significant weight loss
starting 5 dpi and ultimately had group weights drop to 86% and 91%, respectively (Table S4).
Hamsters Treated with Centi-F1 mAb maintained over 100% of their Day 0 weight to the
conclusion of the experiment (13 dpi, Table S4). Virus RNA was detected in pharyngeal swabs
in all groups but trending lower in Centi-F1 mAb-treated animals on Day 11 (p=0.1038, unpaired
t test, Table S4). Similarly, lung tissue collected 13 dpi (end of study) indicate comparable levels
of viral RNA detected (Fig. 6D), but significantly reduced infectious virus in Centi-F1 mAbtreated animals (p=0.0002, unpaired t test, Fig. 6E). These findings demonstrate that a SARSCoV-2 mAb can limit infection in immunosuppressed animals.
Discussion
It has been postulated that both innate immune hyperactivity and adaptive immune dysfunction
result in increased SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and drives severe disease (14). In order to
develop a small animal model of severe disease, evaluate the role of adaptive immunity, and

replicate the COVID-19 lymphopenia observed in human disease, we treated hamsters with CyP.
In this immunosuppressed model, we observe more drastic weight loss, high levels of virus in the
lung, and viral persistence that did not begin to resolve until CyP treatment was stopped (Fig. 1).
Histopathologic findings in the lungs of CyP-treated hamsters also demonstrate the prolonged
pathology and ongoing repair through hyperplastic changes of the bronchial epithelium and type
II pneumocytes that were not observed in the sampled RAG2 KO hamsters. These data
demonstrate the critical role B and T cells play in resolution of disease, and describe an animal
model for severe COVID-19 disease that can be used for rigorous testing of medical
countermeasures.
The recent development of immune function KO hamsters combined with Syrian hamster
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection allows investigation of the role of a specific immune
functions in COVID-19 pathogenesis and protection. Thus far, STAT2 KO hamsters have been
used to demonstrate that type I interferon plays a role in restricting viral dissemination and
promoting lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals (15). Herein we found,
unexpectedly, that SARS-CoV-2 challenge resulted in a uniform lethality in the RAG2 KO
hamsters. It is interesting that onset of disease, as measured by weight loss, was more rapid (by 3
days) in the RAG2 KO animals than immunocompetent, or even transiently immunosuppressed,
hamsters receiving the same challenge dose. This indicates that the absence of functional B cells
and/or T cells exacerbates pathogenesis at a very early stage (within a day or two) after exposure
to virus. The importance of T cells in viral clearance has been noted for other coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV (16) and MERS (17). In fact, depletion of CD3+ T cells correlates with severity and
adverse outcomes (18).
There have been anecdotal accounts suggesting that immunity generated from an initial SARSCoV-2 infection in humans may not be protective against a subsequent infection. Recent studies
using nonhuman primates indicated prior infection results in protective immunity (19). Here, we
show that the immune response from an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a robust
neutralizing antibody response, is protective against re-challenge. We detected reduced levels of
viral genome in pharyngeal swabs and lungs, however, despite circulating neutralizing antibody
available at the time of challenge, virus genome was still detected seven days after re-challenge.
Viral genome in pharyngeal swabs on Day 5 following re-challenge and in lung tissue on Day 7
could indicate that asymptomatic reinfection is possible. Prolonged viral shedding has been
observed in human COVID-19 cases, with detectable neutralizing antibody titers (20).
Alternatively, the genome detected in the swabs could be input virus that is slowly being cleared
from the respiratory system.
Currently, convalescent plasma is an option to treat severe cases of COVID-19 (21). Another
antibody-based options include manufactured polyclonal or mAbs that represent avenues to
prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infections as a standardized product. Several groups have reported
in vitro characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs and a number of antibodies
have been shown to protect in small animal models, including Syrian hamsters (22, 23). Here,
pre-treatment with mAb Centi-F1 resulted in weight maintenance through the experiment,
trending lower levels of viral genome detected in pharyngeal swabs and lung tissues, and most
importantly, reduced levels of infectious virus detected in the lung.
The lack of reduced viral RNA detected by RT-PCR in the passive transfer experiment of F01mAb treated animals highlights a potential confounding factor in determining the efficacy of
mAb treatment. It is possible that the Centi-F1 mAb was not able to clear genomic RNA but

were able to prevent the shedding of infectious virus. In addition to determining infectious viral
loads by plaque assay, RT-PCR to detect subgenomic RNA indicative of a productive infection
would help differentiate the persistence of input virus from productive infection.

Our results expand on the earlier findings that the Syrian hamster model is a suitable small
animal model of COVID-19 (2). Transient and reversible immunosuppression using CyP can be
used to increase the severity and duration of the disease state. Advantages of the CyP model are
that the wild type hamsters are readily available, and would produce a normal immune response
to vaccination. One disadvantage is that disruption of lymphocytes could confound the
evaluation of therapeutics that target components of the immune response, or vaccines that
require rapid mobilization of the adaptive response. For evaluation of those types of medical
countermeasures, the wild type hamster would be preferred. This is the first report that SARSCoV-2 is lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. For practical purposes, uniformly lethal models allow
fewer numbers of animals to detect significant levels of protection facilitating rapid screening of
candidate therapeutics. RAG2 KO hamsters would not be suitable for the use in active vaccine
studies but could be used for antibody passive transfer studies. For example, passive transfer of
immune serum from nonhuman primate or human vaccine studies could be an approach to
investigate mechanisms of protection. Overall, our hamster SARS-CoV-2 models with severe
diseases clinically relevant to those of COVID-19 patients provide a platform for evaluating
candidate medical countermeasures to combat the pandemic.

consolidation with dense aggregates of inflammatory cells. A) Bronchial lumen are lined by
hyperplastic folds of respiratory epithelium (asterisk) and the pleural surface is multifocal
thickened and expanded by fibrous connective tissue and inflammatory cells (arrows). B) The
bronchial lumen are lined by hyperplastic folds of respiratory epithelium (arrow). Areas of
alveolar septa lined rows of type 2 pneumocytes (asterisks). C) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was
frequently detected in alveolar pneumocytes, alveolar infiltrates, and bronchiolar respiratory
epithelial cells from CyP-treated hamsters by ISH. H&E sections (D, E) of lung tissue from
RAG2 KO hamsters collected at the time of death. D) Areas of hemorrhage (asterisk) and
inflammation (arrowheads) expanding the interstitium and connective tissue surrounding bronchi
and arteries (arrows). E) Necrotic bronchial epithelium (arrows) overlaid by hemorrhagic
exudate. Peribronchial connective tissue is expanded by lymphocytes, heterophils (asterisks) and
fewer macrophages that often contain hemosiderin (arrowheads). There is marked consolidation
in surrounding alveoli with marked septal congestion and expansion by previously mentioned
inflammatory cells. F) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was frequently detected in alveolar
pneumocytes, alveolar infiltrates, and bronchiolar epithelial cells from RAG2 KO hamsters by
ISH. (G-I) Immunofluorescence assays demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S or NP, green)
were detected in brochiolar epithelium labelled anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red, G) club
(clara) cells labelled by anti-CC10 antibody (red, H) and alveolar epithelial cells labelled by antiE-cadherin antibody (red, I) in RAG2 KO hamsters. (J-L) TEM of hamster lungs with increasing
viral loads. J) Lung section from hamster with 106 molecules of N2 per 100ng RNA. Inset shows
cytoplasmic vacuole with possible virus (black arrow). K) Lung section from hamster with 107
molecules of N2 per 100ng RNA. Potential mature viral particles (approximately 143-154nm
diameter, arrowhead) are present at the cell periphery and suspected immature virions are
detected more internally in a cytoplasmic vacuole (approximately 62-97nm diameter, black
arrow). L) Lung section from hamster with 108 molecules of N2 per 100ng RNA. Numerous
cytoplasmic vacuoles of possible virus are evident (black arrows). Inset shows an example of
swollen rER (asterisk) with virus forming within the swollen rER (black arrow). Scale bars (A,
D) = 400 microns; (B) = 100 microns; (E) = 28 microns; (C, F) = 100 microns, (G, H, I) = 50
microns. (J-L) = 1 micron.

Fig. 4. SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the tracheal epithelial layer. Tracheal sections were collected
from SARS-CoV-2 infected, CyP-treated hamsters, sorted by lung viral load and analyzed by
transmission electron microscopy. A) The animal with lung viral load of 106 molecules of N2 per
100ng of RNA showed the most intact ciliated cells on the surface of the trachea (arrowheads).
As viral load increases (from animals with lung viral load of 107 (B) and 108 (C) molecules of
N2 per 100ng RNA, respectively) the presence of ciliated cells and epithelial cells lining the
trachea lumen decrease. D) Cells from the low viral load animal show several cytoplasmic
vacuoles with potential immature viral particles (arrows). E) The release of cytoplasmic vacuole
content (possible immature virions, arrows) into the luminal space of a cell that has detached
from the epithelial layer. F) From the highest viral load animal, very few ciliated cells are noted.
Cytoplasmic vacuole with potential immature viral particles are observed (arrow). Scale bars (AC) = 1 micron; (D-F) = 500 nm.
