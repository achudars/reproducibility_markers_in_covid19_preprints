Abstract
Host proteases have been suggested to be crucial for dissemination of MERS, SARSCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, but the relative contribution of membrane versus
intracellular proteases remains controversial. Transmembrane serine protease 2
(TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S
protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry. The main cellular location where
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming occurs remains debatable, therefore hampering the
development of targeted treatments. Herein, we identified the human extracellular serine
protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor.
Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2
in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease–inhibitor
complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load
system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity.
Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS-CoV-2 infections
and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may
be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host
cells.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 2. The efficient transmission of this virus has led to exponential growth
in the number of worldwide cases. Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 entry into
host cells relies on the proteolytic processing of spike (S) protein by host proteases and
engagement of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Hoffmann et al.,
2020). Several proteases are crucial to coronavirus viral entry, and they are found at
different subcellular locations. The S protein cleavage may occur extracellularly near the
plasma membrane by cell surface proteases or intracellularly by lysosomal
endopeptidase enzymes, such as cathepsin L, that facilitate viral entry by activating
membrane fusion and subsequent cell entry through endocytosis, as in the case of
MERS-CoV (Qing et al., 2020). Despite intensive research of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle,
the cellular location where the SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming occurs remains debatable.
In particular, the interplay between the extracellular and intracellular proteases in the
membrane fusion and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is controversial.

Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a cell surface serine protease, may be
involved in cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 has been shown to cleave ACE2 at
arginine and lysine residues within ACE2 amino acids 697–716, which enhances cell
entry (Heurich et al., 2014). TMPRSS2 increases the entry of another coronavirus SARSCoV, not only by processing of the S protein, but also by processing of the host receptor
ACE2 (Heurich et al., 2014). Consistent with these findings, TMPRSS2-deficient mice
have decreased viral spread of SARS-CoV in the airways compared to that of control

mice (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019). In addition, the drug camostat mesylate (camostat),
which inhibits a number of proteases including TMPRSS2, was shown to inhibit SARSCoV-2 entry into cells in vitro. (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Matsuyama et al., 2020). Therefore,
TMPRSS2 is regarded as one of the most important proteases for S protein priming and
cell entry of SARS-CoV-2.

Herein, we developed a cell-based assay to identify TMPRSS2 inhibitors. We compared
the efficiency of TMPRSS2 inhibition by synthetic and natural serine protease inhibitors
that are cell permeable or have extracellular function, including drugs with known function
as protease inhibitors. We identified alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a novel inhibitor of
TMPRSS2. Structural modelling of the Michaelis complex between TMPRSS2 and A1AT
indicated that they dock on the cell surface in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis,
resembling similar serine protease–inhibitor complexes. We further provided proof of
concept for the potential utility of A1AT as an antiviral agent in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A1AT decreased SARS-CoV-2 copy number within target cells when applied during
infection. The effect of A1AT was comparable to the effect of camostat, which was
previously shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020). In contrast to
camostat, which is a cell permeable drug (Reihill et al., 2016), A1AT is a circulating
extracellular protein that inhibits extracellular proteases and does not possess access to
intracellular proteases (Strnad et al., 2020). These findings emphasize the importance of
extracellular proteases to viral cell entry. We suggest that by inhibiting extracellular
proteolytic activity, A1AT can potentially inhibit S protein processing and limit SARS-CoV2 cell-cell spread and dissemination.

Results

Overexpressing TMPRSS2 and measuring proteolytic activity
We aimed to establish an experimental framework for quantifying TMPRSS2 proteolytic
activity. We chose to overexpress TMPRSS2 in a human cell line, HEK-293T, because
of its high transfectability. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates revealed a band at ~60
kD in TMPRSS2-transfected cells but not in control cells (Figure 1A). GAPDH was used
as a loading control. Measurements of the proteolytic activity of the transfected cells using
the fluorogenic peptide substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (BOCQAR-AMC) revealed a >2.5-fold increase in the proteolytic activity of the TMPRSS2transfected cells compared with that of control cells (p = 0.0002; Figure 1B). The
proteolytic activity of the TMPRSS2-transfected cells increased over time compared with
that of control cells (Figure 1C). The mean proteolytic rate per minute of the TMPRSS2transfected cells was increased by >3.5 fold compared to the proteolytic rate of control
cells (p < 0.0001, Figure 1D). The proteolytic activity could be measured hours after
addition of the substrate, and the average proteolytic activity per hour was increased by
>3 fold in TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (p < 0.0001, Figure
1E). Using serial dilutions of recombinant TMPRSS2, we estimated that the amount of
TMPRSS2 that is expressed by TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells is about 100 ng/well
(Supplementary Figure 1). These collective data demonstrated that overexpression of
TMPRSS2 resulted in overproduction of functional TMPRSS2 and established an
experimental system for accurately measuring the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2.

Identifying functional TMPRSS2 inhibitors
We tested the effect of protease inhibitors on TMPRSS2 activity. As a positive control,
cells were treated with camostat mesylate, a drug that has been shown to inhibit
TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Tim Hempel, 2020). As expected, camostat mesylate
inhibited the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 with a calculated IC50 of 42 nM (Figure 2A).
We then tested whether the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) would inhibit
TMPRSS2. However, none of the tested concentrations of SLPI inhibited TMPRSS2
proteolytic activity (Figure 2B). In contrast, A1AT inhibited TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity
in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of 357 nM; Figure 2C). A1AT did not demonstrate toxic
effects in the tested concentrations as demonstrated by viability assays of HEK-293T cells
(Supplementary Figure 2).

Modeling the extracellular TMPRSS2-A1AT Michaelis complex
We modelled the Michaelis complex between TMPRSS2 and A1AT to better understand
the structural basis of TMPRSS2 inhibition prior to A1AT cleavage and covalent
attachment (Figure 3A). Our results suggest that TMPRSS2 interacts with A1AT through
its reactive center loop (RCL), driven by complementary electrostatic interactions at their
surfaces (Figure 3B). Namely, LYS390 (TMPRSS2) forms a strong bifurcated salt bridge
with GLU199/ASP202 (A1AT), while LYS340 and ASP260 form a second electrostatic
contact, whose proximity may be limited by the presence of ASP338 at the surface of
TMPRSS2. In the active site region, TMPRSS2 interacts with A1AT via an extensive
hydrogen bond network (Figure 3C). Part of these interactions stabilize a short,
antiparallel beta-sheet between GLY462 and ILE356-PRO357, similar to the one present

in 1 OPH of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data
Bank (PDB) (Dementiev et al., 2003). At the entrance of the S1 pocket, GLN438 forms
hydrogen bonds with PRO357 and SER359, fixing and orienting the A1AT backbone
around the reactive peptide bond (MET358-SER359). As a result, MET358 is buried
inside the S1 pocket, with its backbone carbonyl placed inside the oxyanion hole, forming
hydrogen bonds with the GLY439 and SER441 (TMPRSS2) backbone amides. These
predicted interactions, together with the overall orientation of the RCL and the catalytic
triad, constitute a suitable environment for the cleavage and covalent binding of A1AT to
TMPRSS2.

Analyzing the A1AT effect on TMPRSS2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infectivity

We investigated whether A1AT can inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells that are
commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 assays because of their TMPRSS2 expression
(Hoffmann et al., 2020). Caco-2 cells were either left untreated or treated with either A1AT
(10 µM) or camostat (10 µM); cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2. Twenty hours
later, quantifying the genomic SARS-CoV-2 from the intracellular RNA revealed a
significant decrease in the viral load in cells that were treated with A1AT or camostat
compared with untreated control cells (p < 0.0001 for both inhibitors; Figure 4). These
data suggest that A1AT can limit the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle by modulating the host cells’
TMPRSS2 activity, similarly to camostat. Importantly, A1AT and camostat were nontoxic
in Caco-2 cells in the tested concentrations (Supplementary Figure 3B).

Plasma A1AT levels in patients with COVID-19
A1AT is normally found at high concentrations in the blood and increases during acute
phase responses or tissue injury (Guttman et al., 2015). We hypothesized that A1AT
concentrations in plasma samples from patients with COVID-19 would correlate with
disease severity as part of the anti–SARS-CoV-2 response. To test this hypothesis, we
analyzed plasma A1AT levels in a cohort of patients who tested positive for COVID-19.
These patients were divided into 3 groups according to disease severity at the time of
emergency department disposition and the maximal severity within 30 days (1 mild –
outpatient care, 2 moderate – need for hospitalization, 3 severe – need for intensive care
unit admission; see methods section). A1AT levels were significantly different between
the group of patients with mild disease and the group of patients with moderate disease.
The mean concentration of A1AT was the highest in the group of patients with severe
disease compared to the other groups (Figure 5A). A1AT concentrations positively
correlated with maximal severity of disease (Figure 5B). Plasma A1AT concentrations
correlated with plasma IL-6 (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001), IL-10 (r = 0.33, p = 0.002), and TNFα
concentrations (r = 0.3; p = 0.002) but not plasma IL-8 concentrations (Figure 5C,D).

Discussion
Herein, we developed a cell-based methodology that allows the quantification of
TMPRSS2 activity. This methodology enables testing the effect of intracellular
compounds and extracellular compounds, thus permitting differentiation between
inhibition of intracellular and extracellular protease. Using this methodology, we revealed
that A1AT, which is approved by the FDA for the treatment of A1AT deficiency, can
efficiently inhibit TMPRSS2. Structural modeling of the A1AT-TMPRSS2 Michaelis
complex revealed that A1AT is likely cleaved and covalently bound to TMPRSS2. The
importance of A1AT in fighting coronavirus infection was supported by the finding that
plasma A1AT levels correlated with COVID-19 severity and with plasma IL-6 levels. A1AT
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection at a comparable level to camostat in Caco-2 cells, a cell
type that is efficiently infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Chu et al., 2020). Therefore, our collective
data suggest that A1AT treatment may benefit COVID-19 countermeasures by inhibiting
extracellular-mediated S protein processing and virus entry.

Though the relative contribution of intracellular proteases and extracellular proteases to
the S protein priming and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be determined, we provide
evidence that extracellular protease activity is rate-limiting in the process of SARS-CoV2 cell entry. Therefore, we suggest that extracellular protease inhibitor delivery may
provide a good strategy for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission by
modulating the exterior of the host cells. The disappointing results of hydroxychloroquine,
which interfere with the activity of intracellular cathepsins in clinical trials and in vitro
assays (Geleris et al., 2020; Kalligeros et al., 2020; Tianling Ou, 2020), are further

consistent with our findings, which support the importance of extracellular proteases.
Notably, neither A1AT nor camostat completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry. This could
be explained by slow, unprocessed ACE2-mediated cell entry in the absence of
TMPRSS2 and/or expression of other proteases, including intracellular proteases that
may cleave the S protein.

Targeting the host extracellular proteases, such as TMPRSS2, has several advantages
over targeting viral proteins. First, anti-virals can rapidly lose their effectiveness due to
the high rate of mutations that occur in the viral genome, but targeting host proteins limits
the risk of drug-resistant viruses due to the relatively low rate of mutations in the host
genome. Notably, the obstacle in targeting human proteins is the potential risk of altering
physiologic pathways. It was suggested that TMPRSS2 initiates a cascade of proteolytic
activation events that regulate processing of proteins in seminal fluid and in the lung
because TMPRSS2 regulates the sodium channel ENaC (Donaldson et al., 2002).
Nevertheless, mice deficient in TMPRSS2 lack any obvious phenotypes, suggesting that
other proteases may have redundant roles and may compensate for the loss of
TMPRSS2 (Kim et al., 2006). Therefore, delivery of TMPRSS2 inhibitors during viral
infections is likely a relatively safe strategy. Although the safety of TMPRSS2 inhibition
has not been clinically proven yet, drugs with proteolytic inhibition activity towards
TMPRSS2 (e.g., camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate) are currently being
pursued for the treatment of COVID-19 . Notably, unlike extracellular A1AT, camostat and
nafamostat are cell permeable and therefore may possess undesired intracellular
protease inhibition capacity. Second, inhibiting cell entry is an upstream intervention

method that limits the overall viral burden and the spread to and replication within tissues,
such as the salivary glands, that have important pathologic consequences involved in
viral transmission to others. Third, inhibiting cell entry may prevent several downstream
disease outcomes. For example, SARS-CoV-2–infected cells undergo cell death by
pyroptosis, a process that is thought to induce complications, such as cytokine storm and
intra-vascular thrombosis, and thereby result in severe disease outcomes. Moreover, cell
death of key alveolar cells induces tissue damage that progresses into acute respiratory
distress syndrome, a severe clinical phenotype of COVID-19. Therefore, inhibiting SARSCoV-2 infection and cell entry by inhibiting the proteolytic priming of the coronavirus S
protein is likely to decrease cell death and thereby reduce disease severity.

To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that A1AT inhibits TMPRSS2, which is
an extracellular protease with a key role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, and influenza viruses (Gierer et al., 2013; Harbig et al., 2020; Hatesuer et al., 2013;
Hoffmann et al., 2020; Sakai et al., 2014; Shirato et al., 2013). A1AT belongs to the super
family of serine protease inhibitors (SERPIN) that irreversibly inhibit serine and cysteine
proteases. Proteases interact with SERPINs as depicted in Figure 3A, forming a Michaelis
complex in which the reactive center loop (RCL) binds the protease active site (modelled
for TMPRSS2 and A1AT in this work). Cleavage of the RCL results in the formation of a
transient, covalent complex that can either undergo dissociation (lower right pathway in
Figure 3A; cleaved A1AT represented by PDB 7API (Engh et al., 1989)) or translocation
and irreversible inhibition (Bao et al., 2018) (upper right pathway in Figure 3A;
represented by PDB 2D26 (Dementiev et al., 2006) in the absence of a TMPRSS2-A1AT–

specific model). One of the fragments of the cleaved RCL is inserted into the central betasheet of A1AT in both pathways, whereas the other fragment (36-aa) is released into the
solvent. Notably, the 36-aa fragment is produced as a result of proteolytic cleavage by
several serine proteases and possesses physiologic functions (Blaurock et al., 2016;
Potere et al., 2019; Risor et al., 2017).

A1AT concentration in the blood can be increased by 6 fold as part of the acute phase of
inflammation or tissue injury (Guttman et al., 2015). A1AT is known to inhibit neutrophil
elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G. Neutrophil elastase cleaves several structural
proteins in the lungs, processes several innate immune mediators, and has been shown
to be involved in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 substrains by cleaving the S1-S2
junction of the S protein (Chandrika Bhattacharyya, 2020). In addition, A1AT promotes
clearance of apoptotic cells (Serban et al., 2017). Increased neutrophil levels have been
found in patients with COVID-19 with severe disease compared to those with mild disease
and healthy controls (Henry et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Notably,
truncated forms of A1AT were significantly increased in the serum of patients with SARS
compared to control patients, and the truncated A1AT levels correlated with disease
severity (Ren et al., 2004). These findings suggest that A1AT may be a part of a natural
protective mechanism to fight coronavirus infection and acute lung disease. Indeed, we
demonstrated that plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 severity and with
IL-6, a cytokine that has been implicated in COVID-19 pathology and as a biomarker for
disease severity (Chen et al., 2020; Henry et al., 2020; McElvaney et al., 2020; Ulhaq and
Soraya, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Notably, A1AT was shown to inhibit the infection of

H3N2 influenza A and influenza B viruses in a murine model (Harbig et al., 2020), even
though these viruses do not require TMPRSS2 priming, underscoring that A1AT can
mediate anti-viral effects via multiple mechanisms.

We suggest that treatment with extracellular protease inhibitors either alone or in
combination with other anti–COVID-19 agents may be a useful antiviral strategy to fight
COVID-19. These protease inhibitors have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry to
host cells by inhibiting S protein priming by TMPRSS2 and other extracellular proteases
and binding of the virus to ACE2 (Figure 5E). A1AT may be particularly effective as it has
dual capacity, inhibiting TMPRSS2 (and hence viral uptake and subsequent replication)
and possessing anti-inflammatory activity(Janciauskiene and Welte, 2016). We suggest
that using these inhibitors may be therapeutic in conditions in which TMPRSS2 function
is pathogenic, such as in several types of coronavirus and influenza infections. The ready
availability of and safety profile A1AT calls attention to its potential clinical use for the
COVID-19 pandemic.

TMPRSS2 quantity estimations, recombinant TMPRSS2 was subjected to gel
electrophoresis with protein lysates from TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells.

Cell viability assay
HEK-293T cells were grown for 48 hours in 96-well plates. Then cells were treated with
the indicated concentrations of A1AT for an additional 3.25 hours. Cell viability was
assessed by Alamar blue cell viability reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Caco-2 cells were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were treated with A1AT or camostat at
the indicated concentrations for 18 hours. Cell viability was estimated by CellTiter-Glo
Cell Viability Assay from Promega according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies
Caco-2 cells were plated in 12-well plates and pretreated for 1 hour prior SARS-CoV-2
infection with DMEM containing A1AT or camostat in the indicated concentrations or
DMEM alone (media-only control). Cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 (through BEI
Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2 Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR52281) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and with the indicated drugs for 1 hour. Then,
cells were washed with DMEM and incubated with DMEM containing A1AT or camostat
or DMEM alone. Twenty hours post infection, RNA was extracted from the cells, and viral
copy number was quantified by real-time, quantitative PCR.

mRNA extraction and real-time, quantitative PCR
Cells were lysed with TriZol LS, and total RNA was isolated from cells with the Direct-zol
RNA mini prep kit (Zymo research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For RNA
sequencing experiments, RNA was treated with the On-Column DNase Digestion kit
(Qiagen) according to the supplied protocol. The amount of the intracellular RNA was
estimated by real-time quantitative PCR performed with the RNA UltraSense™ One-Step
Quantitative RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems) by using the following primer sets:
CDC N1 (forward 5′- GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT, reverse 5’- TCT GGT TAC TGC
CAG TTG AAT CTG, probe 5’-FAM- ACC CCG CAT TAC GTT TGG TGG ACC -BHQ1),
18S rRNA (TaqMan Gene expression assay from ThermoFisher, Hs99999901_s1), and
GusB (TaqMan Gene expression assay from ThermoFisher, Hs99999908_m1).

Template-based molecular docking
The Michaelis complex of TMPRSS2 and A1AT was modelled using HADDOCK v2.4
(Dominguez et al., 2003), a versatile docking engine guided by structural data from
experiments and/or computational models. A complex between S195A bovine cationic
trypsin and the Pittsburgh variant of A1AT (PDB 1OPH (Dementiev et al., 2003)) was
taken as a template to drive the docking process, as well as to obtain the structure of
A1AT (chain A, reverted to its wild-type form). The structure of TMPRSS2 was obtained
from reference (Rensi et al., 2020) (homology model based on PDB 3W94). PS-HomPPI
v2.0 (Xue et al., 2011) was used for mapping the interface residues of PDB 1OPH onto
the query structures and calculating their CA-CA distances. A subset of these distances

within different cutoffs (7, 9, 10, 11, and 15 Å) was then used as unambiguous restraints
to drive the docking between TMPRSS2 and A1AT. The number of structures generated
in each of the docking phases, i.e., rigid-body, semi-flexible, and water refinement, was
kept at 1000, 200, and 200, respectively. The top 4 models generated using each of the
5 cutoffs were analyzed, and the final model was selected on the basis of visual inspection
and energetic terms.

COVID-19 plasma analysis
Adults who presented to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC) Emergency
Department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 and had a clinically indicated blood draw
were prospectively enrolled via an institutional review board–approved waiver of informed
consent. Following collection, samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4°C and
frozen at −80°C until analysis. Inclusion in this analysis was dependent on a positive
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 via a
standard-of-care nasopharyngeal swab. A total of 49 patients were included. The median
age was 46.5 years (IQR: 37–66). The plasma concentration of A1AT was measured on
a Behring Nephelometer II System (BN II, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern,
PA, USA). The plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα were quantified using
the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-Plex assay (Rockville, Maryland, USA). Patients who
were positive for COVID-19 were stratified into subgroups on the basis of disease severity
at ED disposition and maximal disease severity within 30 days of the index ED visit. Mild
COVID-19 was defined as illness requiring only outpatient care (level 1), moderate
COVID-19 was defined as illness requiring hospitalization (level 2), and severe COVID19 was defined as illness requiring Intensive Care Unit admission and/or mechanical

of A1AT with those of IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα were performed using the Spearman's
test.

Statistics
IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression by dose-response inhibition with
variable slopes. Statistical significance was determined using a t test (unpaired, twotailed). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software
Incorporated).

PLX304-TMPRSS2 vector is shown. TMPRSS2-containing V5 tag was assessed by antiV5 antibody, and anti-GAPDH antibody was used as a loading control. B. Arbitrary
fluorescence unit (AFU) measurements of control or TMPRSS-overexpressing cells
incubated with BOC-QAR-AMC for 75 minutes at 37 C are shown. Wells containing PBS
and BOC-QAR-AMC were used as background fluorescence reads. C. Fluorescence of
control or TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells was measured every 15 minutes for a total
time of 180 minutes. The average proteolytic activity rate per minute (D) or hour (E) of
control or TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells. The fluorescent signal was measured by the
UV filter (excitation 365 nm and emission 410 nm). Data in B, D, and E represent the
mean ± SD with interquartile ranges in B, D and E. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

Figure 3. Schematic inhibition of TMPRSS2 by A1AT. A. General inhibitory
mechanism of serpins applied to TMPRSS2 and A1AT are shown. The homology model
of TMPRSS2 is shown as the blue cartoon and A1AT as the grey cartoon, with the
reactive center loop highlighted in gold. B. Shown are the interactions at the interface of
the Michaelis complex model, highlighting LYS340 and LYS390 of TMPRSS2 (blue) and
GLU199, ASP202, and ASP260 of A1AT (grey). C. A close-up of the Michaelis complex
at the active site region is shown. The catalytic triad residues HIS296, ASP345 and
SER441 are depicted in black. Relevant residues are represented as sticks, hydrogen
bonds are represented as dashed black lines, and the cleavage site is indicated by a
black arrow. Note that there are hydrogen bonds at the oxyanion hole between
GLY439/SER441 of TMPRSS2 and MET358 of A1AT. A1AT, alpha 1 antitrypsin;
TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease 2.

Figure 4. The effect of A1AT and camostat on SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies.
Intracellular SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies were analyzed twenty hours after infection of
Caco-2 cells in the presence of A1AT (10 µM), camostat (10 µM), or control media. Data
represent fold change in CoV2 copy number compared to control media. Results are the
mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments performed in duplicate and/or triplicate. A1AT,
alpha 1 antitrypsin.

Figure 5. A1AT concentration in plasma samples of patients with COVID-19 and
suggested role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. A1AT plasma concentrations in patients who
were positive for COVID-19 are shown and stratified according to disease severity at the
time of disposition from the Emergency Department (a) or the maximal severity within 30
days of index Emergency Department visit (Max severity) (b) (1 = Outpatient, 2 =
Hospitalized, 3 = Intensive Care Unit or Death). In (c), correlation between plasma A1AT
concentrations and plasma IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, or TNFα concentrations. r and p values were
calculated according to Spearman correlation. d. plasma concentration of A1AT and IL-6
in each patient with confirmed COVID-19 with markers representing individual patients.
A1AT, alpha 1 antitrypsin; IL, interleukin. e. Model of SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by
extracellular proteolytic events. Extracellular proteases, such as TMPRSS2, process the
S protein on the SARS-CoV-2 envelope in a process called priming. Priming of the S
protein is necessary for binding between the S protein and the host receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Extracellular inhibitors, such as alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT),
prevent the priming of the S protein and inhibit virus entry. In addition, inhibiting
transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) prevents processing of ACE2, which
decreases the infectivity of the coronavirus.
