ABSTRACT: Covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis. The development of effective antiviral
compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein
mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein
at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is Oglycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated.
Our recently developed LC-MS/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motives on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current
knowledge of the spike protein’s glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic
activation.

The World Health Organization was informed of pneumonia
cases of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China
on 31 December 2019 1. A novel coronavirus was identified as
the cause of the disease by further investigations 2. This new
virus is related to the previously identified SARS-CoV (severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and has been named
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2). Symptoms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are
acute onset of fever, myalgia, dyspnea, cough and evidence of
ground-glass lung opacities. We do not have currently an effective vaccine or treatment for the COVID-19 patients and continued research is urgently needed to address the challenges
posed by the pandemic.
Transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2
interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
presented on the surface of human cells and mediates viral entry
3–5
. Both the viral spike and the human ACE2 (hACE2) are glycoproteins and their glycosylation affects their interactions or
vaccine design. Covid 19 spike glycoprotein forms a trimeric
structure on the surface of the virus envelope 6. Each spike protein consists of an S1 and an S2 subunit; the S1 subunit mediates
binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor while the S2 subunit
enables fusion of the virion with the cell membrane and initiates
viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 has 10 to 20 times higher affinity for
the ACE2 receptor than the SARS-CoV 3 which may be, in part,
related to glycosylation of the proteins. SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein carries 22 N-glycosylation sequons 6 and at least 3 sites
of mucin-type O-glycosylation were predicted 7 but were not
yet observed experimentally. The latest analysis shows that 20
out of the 22 N-glycosylation sequons are occupied by complex,
hybrid and oligomannosidic structures. Some of the sequons are

predominantly occupied by oligomannose structures which
could have influence on the trimeric structure. The studies also
detected one O-glycopeptide occupied at sites, distinct from the
predicted furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary 6,8,9.
In this study, we report analysis of the site-specific glycoforms
with focus on the resolution of structural motifs of the identified
O- and N- glycopeptides. To this end, we used high-resolution
LC-MS/MS with HCD fragmentation and modulated NCE 10 to
study a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S full-length protein expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Our analyses identified 9 occupied O-glycopeptides and 17 N-glycopeptides. We resolved, for the first time, LacdiNAc and polyLacNAc structural motifs associated with the N-glycopeptides and
we identified novel O-glycopeptides including a glycopeptide
near the furin cleavage site of the spike glycoprotein.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials and Methods
Materials
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (R683A, R685A, His-tag)
protein expressed in HEK 293 cell line was obtained from Acrobiosystems (Newark, DE, USA). Trypsin Gold and Glu-C,
Sequencing Grade were from Promega (Madison, WI), PNGase

Aliquots of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were dissolved in sodium bicarbonate buffer to a final concentration of 1mg/ml. The
protein solution was reduced with 5 mM DTT for 60 min at 60
°C, alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark,
and digested with Trypsin Gold (2.5 ng/μl) at 37°C in Barocycler NEP2320 (Pressure BioSciences, South Easton, MA) for 1
hour. GluC, PNGase F, neuraminidase and beta galactosidase
digests of tryptic peptides were carried out as described previously 11,12 with heat inactivation (99 °C for 10 min) prior to the
addition of any enzyme.
Glycopeptide analysis using DDA nano LC-MS/MS on the
Orbitrap Fusion-Lumos
Digested proteins were separated using a 120-minute ACN gradient on a 250 mm x 75 μm C18 pepmap column at a flow rate
of 0.3 μL/min as described previously 13. In brief, peptide and
glycopeptide separation was achieved by a 5 min trapping/washing step using 99% solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1%
formic acid) at 10 μL/min followed by a 90 min acetonitrile
gradient at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min: 0-3 min 2% B (0.1%
formic acid in ACN), 3-5 min 2-10% B; 5-60 min 10-45% B;
60-65 min 45-98% B; 65-70 min 98% B, 70-90 min equilibration by 2% B. Glycopeptides were analyzed using Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with the electrospray ionization
voltage at 3 kV and the capillary temperature at 275°C. MS1
scans were performed over m/z 400–1800 with the wide quadrupole isolation on a resolution of 120,000 (m/z 200), RF Lens
at 40%, intensity threshold for MS2 set to 2.0e4, selected precursors for MS2 with charge state 3-8, and dynamic exclusion
30s. Data-dependent HCD tandem mass spectra were collected
with a resolution of 15,000 in the Orbitrap with fixed first mass
110 and 4 normalized collision energy 10, 20 and 35%. ETD
and EThcD methods used calibrated charge dependent parameters and HCD supplemental activation was set to 15% NCE; we
used the same chromatographic method and instrument settings
for the ETD measurements as described above.
Glycopeptide analysis using cyclic ion mobility
LC-IM-MS/MS experiments were performed on a Waters Select Series cyclic ion mobility mass spectrometer with an
ACQUITY M-Class solvent system. Tryptic peptides were separated using a 75 µm x 150 mm ACQUITY BEH C18 column
with a 5 cm Symmetry C18 trap. Peptides were eluted over 60
minutes prior to electrospray ionization and analysis in positive
mode. Glycoforms of the polybasic peptide were isolated in the
quadrupole and fragmented in the trap region prior to ion mobility separations. Ion mobility methods entailing five passes of
the cyclic device were previously optimized for HexNAcHex
and HexNAcHexNeuAc oxonium ions and were used to separate and characterize the oxonium ion fragments of the targeted
glycopeptides. Traveling wave parameters within the cyclic device were kept at default values, 375 m/s and 22V for the wave
velocity and wave height, respectively. Calibration for collisional cross section was performed under a single experimental
condition for both single pass and the 5-pass methods using Major Mix, with calculated uncertainties of less than 0.25% and
1%, respectively.

Data analysis
Glycopeptide identification
Byonic software (protein metric) was used for the identification
of summary formulas of glycans associated with the glycopeptides. Independent searches were performed on the data with
different collision energy (CE) settings. All spectra of the identified glycopeptides were checked manually for the presence of
structure-specific fragments. Analysis of the ion mobility data
was performed using DriftScope (v2.9) by manual extraction of
the retention ranges associated with the glycopeptides.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
N-glycopeptide analysis
We have identified 17 tryptic N-glycopeptides of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein occupied by high mannose, hybrid and
complex glycans. We have determined their site occupancy by
PNGaseF deglycosylation in 18O water as described 11 and we
find majority of the sequons fully occupied (Table 1). We have
found that one sequon is not glycosylated ( N603), that N234 is
almost exclusively occupied by high mannose glycans. We do
not have evidency for occupancy of glycosite N17. The remaining 17 sequons are dominated by complex glycans. In addition,
we confirmed the presence of core fucosylation on 15 of the
occupied sequons (Table 1).

Structural motifs of the N-glycans using modulated collision
energy

We used our recently described workflows, using modulation
of collision energy (CE) for selective fragmentation of the glycopeptides 10, to identify structural motifs of the N-glycosylated
peptides of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We identified the LacdiNAc structural motif on all the occupied sequons of the
SARS-CoV-2 S expressed in the HEK293 cells (Table 1). The
low CE tandem mass spectrum (Figure 1) reveals structural features of an asymmetric LacdiNAc motif contained within a disialylated biantennary N-glycan. Presence of the m/z 366/407

ions distinguishes the LacNAc and LacdiNAc motifs; in addition, we observe the m/z 657/698 ions of their sialylated counterparts. In addition to the fucosylated and/or sialylated LacdiNAc, we also identified polyLacNAc structures on 5 N-glycopeptides (Table 1) and we resolved extensive fucosylation of
the core as well as the outer-arms of the N-glycopeptides as described previously 10. The presence of core fucose was confirmed on 15 sequons and we confirmed the presence of outer
arm fucosylation 11,14 on 7 sequons which is in contrast to the
previously published data 8. This might be a result of slight differences in the HEK293 expression systems used or differences
in the analytical methods. For example, our study analyzed a
modified full-length protein not cleaved by convertases which
could potentially cause some differences. It is, however, more
likely that the energy optimized workflows improve the structural resolution. We do not achieve complete assignment of all
linkages or quantification of the isobaric structures but the presence of these structural motifs, frequently associated with specific biological functions, is clearly established. The overall results show that 5 glycopeptides carry polyLacNac motifs, that

all sequons occupied by complex glycans carry LacdiNAc to
some degree, and that the LacdiNAc structures constitute majority (>50%) of the glycoforms on N165 and N1098. This may
not necessarily reflect the N-glycoforms of a virion but the
HEK293 expression system is commonly used for functional
studies of the S glycoprotein or the production of vaccine candidates which means that resolution of the structures is highly
relevant.

O-glycopeptide analysis

Previously published data describes one O-glycopeptide occupied at S323 and T325 6,8. We identified the same O-glycopeptides but, in addition, we have identified 8 O-glycopeptides occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures (Table 2 and supplemental table 1). Occupancy of the sites varies from <1% to 57%
and is very low for at least three of the glycopeptides. However,
we detect approximately 13% occupancy with core-1 and core2 structures at the T678 (Figure 2 and 3) located near the polybasic furin cleavage site between the S1 and S2 subunits which
evolved in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 7. This is relevant because O-glycans proximal to the convertase cleavage sites of
protein substrates regulate proteolysis 15 and may regulate activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Supplemental Figure 1
documents identification of an O-glycopeptide following deglycosylation with PNGaseF. This is interesting because O-glycosylation in such a close proximity to N-glycosylation is rarely
described; we do not know if this has any functional relevance
but it shows that analysis of N-deglycosylated peptides for Oglycoforms may deserve attention. Retention times of the T687
O-glycoforms (Figure 4) follow the expected trends of structure
dependent reverse phase chromatographic behavior of glycopeptides 16,17.

Structural analysis of the O-glycopeptides using cIMS
We have used cIMS to separate isomeric oxonium ion fragments
of the glycopeptides. We have used the m/z 657 ion to assign
sialylation of the core-2 monosialylated structures. We used an
optimized procedure based on a hemopexin glycopeptide standard, which we described previously 12, and we determined CCS
of the fragment 657 (Figure 6) observed by fragmentation of the
glycopeptide with sialyl-T antigen with linkage (α2-3) (CCS
234.9) and by fragmentation of an N-glycopeptide with sialylLacNAc with (α2-6) linkage (CCS 232.8) (data not shown).

influence of the peptide backbone on the structural resolution.
We were able to confirm the presence of core-2 structures by the
diHexNAc fragment m/z 407 in the HCD spectra using the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Figure 2A inset). The tandem mass spectra obtained from the cIMS instrument preserve large oxonium
ions, such as the intact detached glycan m/z 1022 (Figure 5)
which confirms that a hexasacharide occupies the O-glycopeptide

QTQTNSPR but using beam type fragmentation we could not
determine which serine or threonine is occupied. We cannot fully
exclude the possibility of contribution from a second glycan at
this peptide but neither the ETD not the HCD spectra show evidence of another occupied site besides the T678 of this peptide.
We have also confirmed the presence of an extended core-1

This is in agreement with the previously published results on the
linkages of the sialylated glycans 6,8. We resolved two major IMS
peaks in the cIMS of the fragment m/z 657 using a one pass
method (Figure 7A). With 5 passes, the first peak was partially
separated into two analytes with determined CCSs of 232.8 and
234.9 and a second peak CCS 248.5. This is reproducible for all
2HexNAc containing structures (Supplemental Figure 2). The
CCS of the first peak fits exactly the previously observed CCS of
sialylated α2-6 LacNAc while the CCS of the second peak fits
the CCS of the silylated α2-3 T-antigen. CCS 248.5 of the third
peak is in agreement with the previously described CCS of α2-3
LacNAc 19 20. The peak corresponding to the 2-6 linked sialic
acid is better visible under high collision energy (Figure 7B-D)
due to different stability of the SA-Gal bond 21. We have determined a 7/3 ratio of the GlcNAc-Gal-2-3-SA and GalNAc-Gal-23SA in the mono-sialylated core-2 structure (Figure 7, panel A).
We used the cIMS of the fragment m/z 731 (2HexNAc2Hex) to
determine the ratio of the core-2 structure and the extended
core-1 structure. We obtained 2 major peaks using 5 passes of
the cIMS (data not shown); the first peak (time:69.70; CCS:
238.8) is consistent with a core-2 structure and the second peak
(76.84; CCS: 251.5) with a linear core-1 extended structure with
terminal GalNAc(1-3)Gal as described previously 22. Ratio of the
core-1 with terminal GalNAc(1-3)Gal and the the core-2 structure
is 25/75.

regulated by the nearby O-glycans as described for other convertases. In addition, we identified 8 additional O-glycopeptides of variable occupancy and unknown functional significance. The study expands substantially the knowledge of the
glycoforms of SARS-CoV-2 S expressed in the HEK293 cells
and warrants further exploration of the impact of glycosylation
on the S protein’s function

CONCLUSION
We have used our energy optimized LC-MS/MS and ion mobility MS/MS methods to resolve structural motifs of the N- and
O-glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We identified 17 Nglycopeptides, with many glycoforms including the LAcdiNAc
and polyLacNAc structural motives. This is important for functional studies and the use of the protein as an immunization target. In addition, we identified, for the first time, an O-glycopeptide adjacent to the polybasic furin cleavage site located between the S1/S2 subunits that carries core-1 and core-2 structures capped primarily with α2-3 sialic acid at the T678. The
furin cleavage site is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to the SARS-CoV of 2002 and its cleavage is potentially
