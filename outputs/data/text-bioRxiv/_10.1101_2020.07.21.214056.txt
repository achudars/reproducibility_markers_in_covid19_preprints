Abstract
The impact of movement restrictions during the COVID-19 lockdown on the existing
endemic infectious disease dengue fever has generated considerable research interest. We
compared the Malaysia weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the
period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the
corresponding period that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the dengue
incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a
negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold
steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce
dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences
demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an
exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years. Together with our data on
Aedes mosquitoes from a district of Penang, Malaysia, we revealed that Aedes albopictus is
the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments. The abundance of the
mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong
correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible
diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate. These findings
would help authorities review the direction and efforts of the vector control strategy.

Introduction
Lockdown has been commonly implemented all over the world to halt COVID-19
transmission [1]. This is to control human movement, as physical proximity is a key risk
factor for the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 [2]. Although the physical proximity of humans
shapes the spatial spread of a pathogen, it refers mostly to directly transmitted infectious
diseases [3] such as COVID-19, but the effect on indirectly transmitted infectious diseases
such as dengue fever (DF) remains unclear.
Dengue fever (DF) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne disease in the world [4],
understanding the impacts of human (host) movement on the transmission can improve the
prevention system. Falcón-Lezama et al. [5] used a mathematical model to evaluate the effect
of people's day-to-day movement on the dengue epidemic and concluded that the vector-

host’s spatial connectivity posted epidemic risk. To simulate the actual situation, Stoddard et
al. [6] used contact-site cluster investigations in a case-control design to review the risk of
dengue infection by human movement and argued the importance of movement restriction in
managing the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue virus. However, the previous experimental
configurations were far from the real situation, especially when the mobility of the population
on a large scale is not feasible to demonstrate the direct effect on dengue transmission. With
the imposition of the COVID-19 partial lockdown in Malaysia on 13th to 20th weeks of 2020
(18 March to 12 May 2020), about 90% of people were restricted to their homes, and 10%
essential workers were allowed to carry out their daily activities for the whole country [7];
thus, the unprecedented large-scale movement restriction of host provides opportunities to
evaluate its direct impact on the dengue transmission.
To understand the direct impact of the large-scale movement restriction on Malaysia
dengue endemic, comparison between the actual incidences trend with a simulation trend that
expect no interference could be one of the approach as demonstrated by other studies on
infection diseases [8-10]. To construct a best-fitting simulation, we have to understand the
dengue endemic pattern in Malaysia, in which the dengue endemic in Malaysia is seasonal,
with variable transmission and prevalence patterns affected by the large diversity in rainfall
and spatial variation [11]. The major transmission periods of DF occur from June to
September, following the main rainy seasons; the minor transmission period is from
September to March, following monsoon rains sessions that bring higher precipitation and
lead to the greater potential breeding ground for the vector [12]. The end of the minor peak
and the start of major peaks of DF transmission often coincides with the duration of the
COVID-19 lockdown (Figure 1). We postulate the trend of dengue incidences could be
altered due to the changes of host movements, and seasonal time series analysis such as
SARIMA is a suitable approach to construct the simulation as the method usually used to
predict or forecast the infection incidences that were seasonal [8-10].
One of the key element in dengue transmission is the abundance and distribution of
the vectors - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, in which the spatial distribution is also
potentially affected by movement restrictions of humans. By using an agent-based
transmission model, Reiner et al. [13] indicated that the socially structured movement of
humans caused a significant influence on dengue transmission, and the infection dynamics
were hidden by the diffusive effect of the vectors. The implementation of lockdown in
Malaysia changed the host’s daily activities, most of the time people were contained in their

own housing area, and also to both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus that are highly
anthropophilic, in which Ae. aegypti almost exclusively rely on human blood and Ae.
albopictus is an aggressive and highly adaptive species that can easily colonize the habitat of
other mosquitoes in urban areas [14]. In addition, the spatial distribution of the host also
influenced the behavior of the vectors, and previous studies [14-18] identified a shift of the
Ae. albopictus habitat to an indoor environment where the species usually inhabit the forest
or are mostly vegetative and cause interspecies competition with other existing mosquito
species, such as Ae. aegypti. Therefore, when the COVID-19 partial lockdown restricts
humans in mostly indoor environments with minimum outdoor activities, we are interested in
the distribution of the mosquitoes as well.
We study the effect of the physical proximity restriction on humans during the
COVID-19 lockdown in Malaysia on two variables as shown in the paradigm in Fig. 2.
Country dengue incidences trend. This study aims to understand the impact of movement
restrictions on the dengue transmission by statistically comparing the trend of actual reported
dengue incidences with a SARIMA model simulation and previous years of incidences. We
establish the SARIMA model simulation that expects no MR practice from the dataset of
Malaysia weekly reported dengue incidences of previous years (2015 to 2019). We evaluate
the level of heterogeneity of actual trend from simulation and previous years according to the
phases of lockdown that implemented by Malaysia Government.
The occurrence of vectors and correlation with locally reported incidences. To rationale
the changes of country dengue incidences trend, we aim to obtain data on the abundance and
distribution of Aedes mosquitoes during the period of lockdown by conducting sampling in
the indoor and outdoor environments of areas from a district of Penang Malaysia.

Methods
Data collection
We started the analysis from the data of 2015, which recorded the second-highest dengue
incidence after 2019 [19]. We retrieved the data from the official press statement and the
Dengue Surveillance System developed by the Vector-Borne Disease Section, Ministry of
Health (MOH), Malaysia, to monitor dengue transmission using remote sensing (RS) –
iDengue [20], under the supervision of Remote Sensing Agency Malaysia. This surveillance

system monitors dengue transmission across the country by updating dengue fevers reported
in every hospital and medical institution on a daily basis, and all notified cases were followed
up by the relevant health authorities for case verification before being recorded in the registry
of the Dengue Surveillance System.

Temporal analysis of Malaysia dengue incidences during partial lockdown
We observed the previous temporal pattern of dengue incidences and found that the period of
the COVID-19 partial lockdown [13th week (March 18) to 24th week (June 9) of 2020]
coincided between the end of minor (March-May) and the start of major (June-Sept)
fluctuations of dengue transmission (Fig. 1). Therefore, to understand the heterogeneity of the
trend of Malaysia weekly incidences due to the partial lockdown, we compared the actual
trend with three reference trends, namely, a simulation, mean weekly incidence of year 20152019, and the years that recorded the highest incidences trend (2019). The simulation was
assumed to be without the interference of city lockdown and population movement control.
To construct a simulation, we applied seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average
(SARIMA) models, which are advantageous for modeling the seasonal and time-based
dependent configuration of a time series and are commonly applied for epidemiological
surveillance [8-10, 21]. We trained the models by using Malaysia weekly dengue incidences
from 1st week of 2015 to 52nd week of 2019 from the dataset, and forecasted the incidences
on 1st to 35th weeks of 2020, including the phases of partial lockdown in Malaysia (Table 1).
We constructed and selected the best SARIMA model (p,d,q) x (P,D,Q) [p is the
autoregressive lags, d is the degree of differencing, q is the moving-average lags, P is the
seasonal autoregressive lags, D is the seasonal degree of differencing and Q is the seasonal
moving-average lags] according to the methods of Box and Jenkins [22]. In addition, to
obtain the best-fitting model, each of the constructed SARIMA model of forecast incidences
before lockdown (1st to 12th weeks of 2020) was correlated with the actual weekly trend of
dengue incidences by using Spearman rank correlation at the significance level of 0.05 (SPSS
17.0, IBM Corp.). The best-fitting model was selected based on the lowest values of the
normalized Bayesian information criterion (NBIC) and the root mean square error (RMSE)
[20], and the strongest correlation coefficient with the actual trend of 1st to 12th weeks of
dengue incidences.

Furthermore, we divided the time series of 1st to 35th weeks of 2015-2020 into eight
stages (two prelockdown periods, six phases during the partial lockdown) according to the
announcement from the Malaysia government [23] (Table 1) and compared the actual weekly
dengue incidences during the period of partial lockdown with the those of the simulation and
previous years (2015-2019) using two-way ANOVA with two independent variables, namely,
trends (actual/simulation/previous years of incidences), and phases. Because the trends follow
an open-up parabolic pattern, we further distinguish the pattern by comparing the slopes for
the phases (based on incidences in three weeks) to study the rates of decline and endemic
incline.

Mosquito occurrences
We assessed the abundance and distribution of Aedes mosquitoes during the movement
restriction of human in particular the indoor and outdoor environments due to the possibility
of a decrease in artificial breeding sites reported at the beginning of lockdown [24] and the
host contained in their housing area. The sites were selected from three residential areas,
namely, Taman Bukit Jambul (5°20'06.6"N 100°17'18.7"E), Taman Permai Indah
(5°20'54.4"N 100°17'52.9"E) and Taman Jelutong (5°23'18.3"N 100°18'37.7"E) which are
located within the Northeast Penang Island District (Fig. 3) and were the dengue hotspot area
[25]. Due to the restriction of movement order from Malaysia government [26], the sampling
was conducted at limited coverage of area, with five outdoor (n=5) and indoor (n=5)
locations from each of the sampling area, respectively. For high anthropophilic mosquitoes,
the human landing catch (HLC) method is the most effective sampling method [27], although
it poses the risks of the human contracting the mosquito-borne pathogen, especially at the
location where dengue and chikungunya are endemic. Three participants were voluntarily
participated to the experiments and all their informed consents were confirmed and obtained
prior to sampling. All experimental methodologies were approved by the ethical committee
of UOW Malaysia KDU Penang University College and in accordance with the guidelines of
the ethical committee of UOW Malaysia KDU Penang University College. The caught was
performed in the early morning from 7:30 A.M. to 10 A.M. with the left arm and both legs
exposed without any artificial chemical (e.g., lotion and body shampoo) interference; the
mosquitoes were collected by a manual aspirator and transferred to a sealed container.
Mosquitoes were killed by freezing, counted, and identified using taxonomy keys. The

identification of mosquitoes was based on the distinguish features - the lyre-shaped markings
on Ae. aegypti and the white stripe marking on the thorax of Ae. albopictus, we also focused
on the clypeus-pedicel parts and mesepimeron of Ae. aegypti that consisted of distinctive
white scales. The counts of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from indoor and outdoor locations
for the eight stages of the time series during partial lockdown were obtained and correlated
with the weekly reported dengue incidences of Penang, Malaysia by using Spearman rank
correlation at the significance level of 0.05 (SPSS 17.0, IBM Corp.).

Results
Temporal analysis of dengue incidences during partial lockdown
Most of the studies on the growth of dengue incidences in Malaysia have focused on the total
cases reported annually, in which the proposed model may not be sensitive and flexible
enough to predict growth and propose necessary management. To our knowledge, this study
is the first to report a simulation model with weekly dengue incidences in 2020, including the
period of COVID-19 partial lockdown in Malaysia. To select the best-fitting simulation
model, Table 2 shows the comparison of the NBIC, RMSE, and MAPE of nine SARIMA
models, and the best-fitting forecast model for dengue incidences is SARIMA (1,1,0) (1,1,1)
model due having the lowest NBIC and RMSE, strongest correlation (r=0.718, p<0.05)
between the forecasted and actual incidences trend before partial lockdown (1st to 12th weeks
of 2020), and the model also passed the Ljung–Box Q Test (z = 19.782, p = 0.180).
As seen in Fig. 4, when we generated a simulated model on the trend of 13th to 35
weeks of 2020, which coincided with the COVID-19 partial lockdown period in Malaysia,
the actual dengue incidence trend was significantly diverted and demonstrated a stronger
negative steepness compared with the simulated trend. The actual trend is lower than the
lower confidence level of forecasted trend (Fig.4), which implied that the actual dengue
incidence trend significantly disobeyed the simulation, which presumed no lockdown,
indicating that movement control greatly impacted dengue transmission in Malaysia. To
further analyze the changes in dengue incidence trends due to the partial lockdown, we
divided the time series of endemical weeks into eight stages as described in Table 1, and Fig.
5 describes the ANOVA comparison and Table 3 showed the slopes of the eight stages for
previous years (mean weekly incidence of 2015-2019), the SARIMA model simulated trends,

year 2019 and actual dengue incidences during the COVID-19 partial lockdown. Some
researchers have proposed that the dengue incidences in 2020 were lower than those in 2019
[16], but when we averaged the weekly incidences of the previous five years (2015-2019),
2020 had significantly higher dengue incidences at prelockdown 1 and 2 even though the
slopes between the dengue incidences of the previous years and those of the year 2020 during
the period of prelockdown (1 and 2) are fairly the same. When Malaysia imposed phase 1 of
the partial lockdown, the slope declined dramatically, which was 319% steeper than in
previous years and 650% steeper than SARIMA simulated trend. These provide a strong
implication that movement control during partial lockdown significantly reduced the reported
dengue incidences. Although at phases 2 to 4, the incidences in 2020 were significantly lower
than those in previous years, when we compared the stages for the slope to become positive
(which indicates an upsurge in dengue incidences), this change in slope occurred in 2020 two
stages (4 weeks) earlier than in previous years; specifically, a positive slope was obtained at
phase 3 in 2020 compared to in previous years, in which a positive was obtained at phase 5.
Furthermore, at phase 5, the steepness of the slope of the year 2020 spiked from phase 4 to
phase 5 compared to previous years, with the steepness increasing from 22% to 227%,
suggesting a significant increase in dengue transmission.

Mosquito occurrences
To study one of the factors that contributes to the spread-out of dengue transmission during
the COVID-19 partial lockdown, we assessed the abundance and distribution of vectors
during the partial breakdown. Fig. 6 shows the total numbers of Ae. albopictus collected from
the outdoor area of the sampling locations during the period of partial lockdown. Ae.
albopictus is the predominant species in the outdoor area, with no Ae. aegypti was caught.
The abundance of Ae. albopictus showed slight fluctuation patterns during the partial
lockdown but still demonstrated a strong linear increment throughout the eight phases of
partial lockdown, and showed strong correlation with Penang reported dengue incidences
(r=0.952, p<0.001). In general, the total number of mosquitoes caught indoors was
significantly lower than that outdoors, and both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were caught
indoors, with the abundance of Ae. aegypti being relatively low and plateauing throughout
phase 3 to 6. However, Ae. albopictus demonstrated higher abundance and exponential
growth with the population during the same corresponding period (Table 4).

Discussion
The factors that contribute to dengue transmission are multifaceted, and the spatial variation
in the contact rates of the host and vector are probably the most important factors for the
dynamics of DENV [28]. With the movement restrictions (MRs) imposed in Malaysia due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, we can investigate the effect of the large-scale MRs of the host on
two interrelated variables: dengue transmission and Aedes mosquitoes occurrences. We
analyze the dengue incidence trends by comparing their significant differences among the
phases before and during the lockdown to those of the same corresponding periods for
previous years and simulation. We first reported evidence that the MRs of the COVID-19
partial lockdown significantly influenced the weekly dengue incidence trend in Malaysia. Our
findings provide direct evidence from analysis and extend the studies of Reiner et al. [13] and
Falcón-Lezama et al. [5], which demonstrated that people's movement affected dengue
transmission by using a simulation model. The early decline in dengue incidences was also
reported in India, with dengue cases dropping by 50% compared to previous years. The
decline of incidences at the beginning of the lockdown could have occurred for several
reasons: (1) fewer hosts available outdoors and therefore less vector-host contact, as Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus are exophilic [29]; (2) the alteration of the environment and
relatively fewer artificial breeding sites for the vector due to less solid waste from humans
[24]; and (3) the limited movement of infected patients due to the COVID-19 partial
lockdown.
Unfortunately, our analysis showed that the dengue incidences rebounded earlier and
spiked up at a higher rate than in previous years, indicating that the large-scale MRs of the
population are not sustainable in controlling the spread of dengue. The finding is compatible
with the situation in Singapore, which has had the most serious dengue outbreak in seven
years [30], and an agent-based simulation model study by Jindal and Rao [31] that showed a
significantly higher risk and severity of dengue transmission after the COVID-19 partial
lockdown. The stay-at-home situation makes the host available most of the time in the indoor
environment and optimizes the biting activities for endophagic Ae. aegypti to transmit the
virus. In contrast to Harrington et al. [32], who argued that people, rather than mosquitoes,
rapidly move the virus within and between rural communities and places due to the limitation

of the flight range of female Ae. aegypti, our result of Aedes mosquitoes revealed that the
element of vector dispersal plays a more crucial role in spreading the virus, when the
abundance growth of the sampling locations correlated strongly with locally reported dengue
incidences. We also suggest that Ae. albopictus could be the key substitution vector that
contributes significantly to dengue virus circulation, and therefore, the vector control
direction and strategies should be redesigned.
With no specific previous entomological data about female adult Ae. albopictus in the
corresponding period with lockdown, we refer to Rozilawati et al. [14] and Rahim et al. [33],
who studied the seasonal abundance of Ae. albopictus in Penang by sampling eggs, the
Ovitrap index, the container index (CI), the house index (HI) and the Breteau Index (BI).
Their results demonstrated that the indexes of Ae. albopictus for the corresponding period of
phase 2 to 4 of lockdown should be lower, in contrast to our finding that the abundance of Ae.
albopictus increased steadily from phases 1 to 5. There are several reasons for the increase in
Ae. Albopictus. First, as proposed by the WHO [34], the upsurge of Aedes mosquitoes may be
due to the southwestern monsoon (end of May to September), which brought a higher
frequency of precipitation and higher humidity and temperature, and therefore, a higher
breeding rate for the mosquitoes. Second, a minimum centralized vector control program can
be conducted due to the stay-at-home policy. It is relevant to any method that is intended to
reduce dengue incidences by reducing, but not eliminating, Aedes mosquito populations.
Before that, researchers [35] have associated the index of the temporal vector with dengue
occurrence, and the relationships between Aedes mosquito density and DENV transmission
indexes for Ae. aegypti density are correlated with the prevalence of human dengue infections
but are relatively weakly correlated with the incidences, indicating that other factors were
involved in determining the incidence pattern. This is supported by the participant during the
Aedes survey when a fogging activity was observed on May 28, 2020 (22nd weeks of 2020,
phase 5 – conditional movement control order), and total Ae. albopictus was significantly
lower on May 29, 2020, but the mosquitoes caught afterward remained elevated in general.
Furthermore, our findings showed the presence of both Ae. agypti and Ae. albopictus
from an indoor environment but no Ae. aegypti from the outdoors, indicating that Ae.
albopictus is better adapted to a sudden change in the environment, such as the duration of
lockdown when most of the hosts shift to the indoors. With the consistent growth rate of the
indoor and outdoor populations, we postulate that Ae. albopictus invades the habitat of Ae.
aegypti and showed a high possibility of colonizing the habitat. Our result is consistent with

Nur Aida et al. [36] and Dieng et al. [18], who found that they could increase the
invasiveness of Ae. albopictus by obtaining a high number of egg and mosquito counts from
the indoor environment of Penang Island. Previous studies [14, 16, 37] from other countries
have also reported the aggressive invasive behavior of Ae. albopictus, which shared the
habitat with other native or existing mosquitoes, including Ae. aegypti, which are commonly
predominant in indoor environments [38]. Due to the restriction of traveling during the period
of lockdown, our results provided limited area coverage, but when considering the scale of
the study as a districts-level assessment, the results propose a few important discoveries of
vector distribution and occurrence during the MRs of lockdown.
