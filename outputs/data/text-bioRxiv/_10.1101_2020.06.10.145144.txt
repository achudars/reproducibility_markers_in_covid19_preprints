Short Title: Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 models

23

One Sentence Summary: Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis/treatment showed no beneficial

24

effect in SARS-CoV-2 hamster and macaque disease models.

25
26

We remain largely without effective prophylactic/therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.

27

Although many human clinical trials are ongoing, there remains a deficiency of supportive

28

preclinical drug efficacy studies. Here we assessed the prophylactic/therapeutic efficacy of

29

hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a drug of interest for COVID-19 management, in two animal

30

models. When used for prophylaxis or treatment neither the standard human malaria dose

31

(6.5 mg/kg) nor a high dose (50 mg/kg) of HCQ had any beneficial effect on clinical disease

32

or SARS-CoV-2 kinetics (replication/shedding) in the Syrian hamster disease model.

33

Similarly, HCQ prophylaxis/treatment (6.5 mg/kg) did not significantly benefit clinical

34

outcome nor reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication/shedding in the upper and lower respiratory

35

tract in the rhesus macaque disease model. In conclusion, our preclinical animal studies do

36

not support the use of HCQ in prophylaxis/treatment of COVID-19.

37
38

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of

39

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). SARS-CoV-2 infections were initially reported in

40

China near the beginning of December 2019 (2). Following early spread through Asia, and

41

subsequently to European, American and African countries, the virus is responsible for the third

42

pandemic of the 21st Century. With currently over 6.6 million confirmed cases and >390,000

43

deaths worldwide, health systems are stretched beyond limit with largely no proven treatment or

44

prophylaxis available to reduce the burden (3). Public health measures combined with

45

increasingly severe restrictions on public life have been implemented in many countries to stop

46

SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The goal of current public health strategies is to flatten the

47

epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 curve to ease the burden on health care systems

48

challenged by the highly intensive care required for a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases.

49

Over 1,000 clinical trials are currently open or being established in different countries testing

50

drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and inhaled

51

interferon beta-1a (4). Yet, many of these treatments have not been empirically tested in relevant

52

SARS-CoV-2 animal disease models to determine preclinical efficacy, and thereby provide

53

valuable insight into prioritization of drugs to move forward in humans.

54

At the time this work was started, the US FDA had given emergency approval for the use of

55

chloroquine and HCQ in COVID-19 patients (5). In vitro data on the inhibitory effect of

56

chloroquine and HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 replication had been published (6-8) and HCQ alone or

57

in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin had been used in early clinical trials to

58

treat COVID-19 cases with varying effect (9-11). Despite ongoing clinical trials, preclinical

59

efficacy data on the effect of HCQ in SARS-CoV-2 animal disease models were lacking. Herein,

60

we assessed the efficacy of HCQ prophylaxis and treatment in two established animal disease

61

models, the Syrian hamster and rhesus macaque (12, 13).

62

First, we confirmed the in vitro inhibitory effect of HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6

63

cells. Cells were pretreated with differing drug concentrations and the effect on viral RNA load

64

in tissue culture supernatant was determined 72 hours after infection by quantitative reverse

65

transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (fig. S1). The half-maximal effective

66

concentration (EC50) value for HCQ was 164.7nM, consistent with low/sub-micromolar levels

67

previously reported for the established in vitro inhibitory effect of HCQ on SARS-CoV-2

68

replication (6-8).

69

Having confirmed in vitro efficacy, we next tested the ability of HCQ to alter the course of

70

SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster disease model (12). Five groups of hamsters (n=6 per group)

71

were prophylactically or therapeutically treated with an intraperitoneal infection of a standard

72

(6.5 mg/kg in PBS; human dose for malaria prophylaxis/treatment) or high (50 mg/kg in PBS)

73

dose HCQ regimen; control groups were treated with vehicle only. Hamsters were intranasally

74

infected with SARS-CoV-2 using a dose of 1x104 median tissue culture infectious doses

75

(TCID50). For prophylaxis, a single treatment was performed 24 hours prior to infection. The

76

therapeutic treatment started 1 hour after SARS-CoV-2 infection and was continued for 3

77

consecutive days. Disease manifestation in this model is transient and clinical signs peak

78

between days 3 and 5 post-infection with ruffled fur, increased respiration rate and reduced

79

mobility (12). Virus replication and shedding was determined by qRT-PCR in swab samples

80

(oral and rectal) collected on days 2 and 4, and lung tissue taken at necropsy on day 4 post-

81

infection. Regardless of HCQ administration, all animals showed comparable high levels of

82

genome copy numbers for oral swabs (>107 genome copies/mL) and comparable lower numbers

83

for rectal swabs (<106 genome copied/mL) decreasing in all groups over time (Fig. 1, A and B).

84

Like viral RNA loads in swabs, there was no significant difference in disease manifestation over

85

the time of the study. Gross lung pathology was similar among the groups consisting of focally

86

extensive areas of consolidation that failed to collapse upon removal (fig. S2). Viral lung loads

87

on day 4 were high (1014 genome copies/g) but indistinguishable between all groups (Fig. 1C).

88

Lung to body weight ratios were similar in all animals with no significant difference between

89

groups (Fig. 1D). Overall, HCQ administered either as prophylaxis or treatment at standard or

90

high doses did not have any significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding, nor

91

disease manifestation and progression in the Syrian hamster model.

92

Next, we assessed HCQ efficacy in the rhesus macaque; a recently developed nonhuman primate

93

model displaying mild to moderate COVID-like disease upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (13).

94

Similar to the hamster study, we investigated the effect of HCQ when administered either

95

prophylactically or as a treatment after infection. For the prophylactic arm, 10 healthy rhesus

96

macaques were randomly divided into vehicle control and HCQ prophylaxis groups (n=5 per

97

group). Animals were treated by oral gavage with either vehicle (PBS) or HCQ (6.5mg/kg in

98

PBS) three times one week apart (day -9, day -2 and day 5) (Fig. 2A). To test the efficacy of

99

HCQ as a treatment, a separate group of 10 healthy rhesus macaques were randomly divided into

100

vehicle control and HCQ treatment groups (n=5 per group). Animals were treated by oral gavage

101

with either vehicle (PBS) or HCQ (6.5mg/kg in PBS) starting 12 hours post-infection followed

102

by treatment at 18, 36, 60, 84 and 108 hours post-infection (Fig. 2B). Animals in all groups were

103

infected on day 0 with SARS-CoV-2 (total dose 2.8 x106 TCID50 by a combination of four routes

104

(intratracheal, oral, intranasal and ocular) as previously described (13, 14). Animals were

105

monitored at least twice daily using an established scoring sheet designed to assess clinical signs

106

of disease (13,15). Multiple physical examinations were performed on different days pre- and

107

post-inoculation including a clinical evaluation, radiographs, blood collection, and swabs (oral

108

and nasal). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on days 3, 5 and 7 (post-mortem) (Fig.

109

2, A and B). The endpoint for both studies was day 7 post-infection, at which time all animals

110

were euthanized and necropsied.

111

To ensure that drug was present in therapeutic quantities plasma levels of HCQ and its secondary

112

metabolites were measured. HCQ was detected in plasma samples post-administration in all

113

prophylactically or therapeutically treated animals with concentration ranging from 1.2 to

114

10.5ng/mL (3.6 nM to 31.3 nM) and 8 to 98 ng/mL (23.8 nM to 291.8 nM), respectively (Fig. 2,

115

C and D). HCQ was also detected in lung tissue at time of necropsy in all prophylactically or

116

therapeutically treated animals ranging from 0.85 to 4.18 ng/mg tissue and 1.39 to 11.54 ng/mg

117

tissue, respectively. These numbers are in good agreement with the reported long half-life and

118

large volume of distribution of HCQ (16). HCQ cytochrome p450 catalyzed secondary amine

119

metabolites desethylchloroquine and desethylhydroxychloroquine, and the primary amine

120

metabolite bisdesethylchloroquine are considered to be active forms of the drug in other disease

121

models (17). Both desethylchloroquine and desethylhydroxychloroquine were detected in

122

intermediate concentrations, while trace amounts of bisdesethylchloroquine were detected in

123

both plasma and lung homogenate suggesting substantial persistence of active drug forms over

124

the course of treatment (fig. S3). The plasma HCQ levels measured here fall within or near

125

human therapeutically relevant ranges for other disease such as malaria and systemic lupus

126

erythematosus (15 to 100 ng/mL plasma) (18,19). However, since SARS-CoV2 is a respiratory

127

disease, levels of drug in lung tissue are a better indicator of therapeutic potential.

128

Volume/concentration is difficult to estimate in tissue due to compartmentalization resulting in a

129

non-homogenous distribution of the drug. However, using a water content of 80% by weight

130

(20), day 7 levels in the lung indicated conservative estimates of at least 1 µg/mL (~3.0 uM) in

131

all animals, which is above the cell culture EC50 which we determined to be ~ 0.2 uM (164.7

132

nM, 55 ng/mL here (fig. S1).

133

Macaques in both the prophylactic and treatment arms of the study first displayed clinical signs

134

of SARS-CoV-2 infection on day 1, which peaked at day 2 and animals remained mildly to

135

moderately ill until the study endpoint at day 7 (Fig. 2, E and F). Clinical signs included reduced

136

appetite and ruffled fur followed by pale appearance and irregular increased abdominal

137

respiration (table S1). Overall, animals in the vehicle treated groups appeared to have slightly

138

higher clinical scores throughout, but daily differences were not statistically significant.

139

Hematology and serum chemistry were unremarkable for all animals in both study arms.

140

Radiographic signs in the prophylaxis, treatment and control groups were minimal over the study

141

course (fig. S4). Pulmonary infiltrates, when seen, were noted to be of a mild unstructured

142

interstitial pattern. The pattern was rarely seen in the upper lung, being more commonly found in

143

middle and caudal lung lobes. No differences were noted in severity or appearance of

144

radiographic signs between HCQ prophylaxis, treatment or control groups.

145

Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all animals of both

146

studies with the highest load on either day 1 or day 3, which then gradually decreased until the

147

end of the study (Fig. 3, A – D). Viral load in nasal swabs were consistently higher than in

148

oropharyngeal swabs. BAL samples were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 (post-mortem) and viral

149

loads were similar to nasal and oropharyngeal swabs with decreasing loads over time (Fig. 3, E

150

and F). Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in virus load and shedding

151

between HCQ- and vehicle-administered animals in the prophylaxis and treatment regimens.

152

At necropsy, gross pathology revealed consolidated lungs in animals of all groups with lesions

153

observed largely in the lower lung lobes, although some of the legions may have been the result

154

of the post-mortem BAL (Fig. 4, A and B). All other gross pathology was normal except for

155

enlarged cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes in several animals across the groups. Histological

156

analysis of the lungs of animals in the different prophylaxis and treatment groups determined a

157

comparable degree of pulmonary pathology when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 similar to what

158

had been published previously (13,14) (Fig. 4C). Lesions were mild to moderate and

159

characterized as multifocal interstitial pneumonia frequently centered on terminal bronchioles.

160

The pneumonia was evident by a thickening of alveolar septae by edema fluid and fibrin and

161

small to moderate numbers of macrophages and fewer neutrophils. Infiltration of small numbers

162

of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils were noticed in alveoli. Lungs with moderate

163

changes also had alveolar edema and fibrin with formation of hyaline membranes. There was

164

minimal to moderate type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Occasionally, bronchioles had necrosis,

165

and loss and attenuation of the epithelium with infiltrates of neutrophils, macrophages and

166

eosinophils. Perivascular infiltrates of small numbers of lymphocytes forming perivascular cuffs

167

were noticed multifocally (Fig. 4C). Overall, there was no significant difference between vehicle

168

and HCQ treated animals in either of the regimens, prophylaxis or treatment.

169

Viral RNA loads were determined in several respiratory tissues using qRT-PCR (Fig. 5, A and

170

C). Highest genome copy numbers were found in lung tissue with a marginal but not significant

171

benefit for the HCQ- over the vehicle-treated group in the prophylaxis study arm when all lung

172

lobe samples were combined (Fig. 5, B and D). Virus isolation from tissues was inconsistent

173

among animals in the different groups, but at least one sample in each group showed infectious

174

virus for almost all respiratory tissues (Fig. 5, A and C). There was no difference between

175

animals of vehicle- and HCQ-treated groups in the prophylaxis and treatment study arms, which

176

is consistent with the lack of any observed effect of HCQ on virus shedding parameters.

177

In this study we used two established COVID-like animal models (12,13) and applied the

178

standard weight-based oral administration of HCQ prophylaxis and treatment of malaria in

179

humans (21). For the Syrian hamster model, we also included a high HCQ dose regimen (7.5

180

times the standard dose regimen) both prophylactically and as a treatment. For prophylaxis we

181

used a weekly dosing regimen. For treatment, we administered HCQ starting shortly after

182

infection and continued daily until study end. HCQ pharmacokinetic studies in humans and

183

animal models have demonstrated a rapid blood bioavailability following oral administration

184

with peak levels being reached in 2 to 4 hours followed by rapid absorption in various tissues

185

including the lung (22,23). Samples for drug pharmacokinetics in plasma were collected when

186

the drug levels were low, just before the administration of the next treatment. Nevertheless, the

187

measurements taken during both studies are in good agreement with data from humans and

188

animal models and suggest accumulation of drug in the lung at therapeutic levels (18,19).

189

The use of HCQ and chloroquine as treatment options for COVID-19 patients may have been

190

partially rooted in early observations for their effect in impairing SARS-CoV-2 replication in

191

vitro (6-8). These in vitro studies, which we confirmed herein, identified HCQ (and other 4-

192

aminoquinolines) as potent inhibitors of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, with low EC50

193

values within the range of antivirals such as remdesivir (6); a drug that is now approved for

194

COVID-19 cases by the FDA. The mechanism of action of 4-aminoquinolones against SARS-

195

CoV-2 in vitro is not well defined, but increasing endosomal pH, inhibition of autophagosome-

196

lysosome fusion, impairment of enzymes important for virus replication, and effects on protein

197

glycosylation have been proposed, which may result in interference with SARS-CoV-2

198

entry/fusion, replication and spread (24, 25). However, despite the promising in vitro effect

199

observed by us and others, we did not observe any significant prophylactic or therapeutic benefit

200

of HCQ following in vivo infection in two animal disease models.

201

The use of HCQ to treat COVID-19 has been controversial since the results of the first clinical

202

trials (9-11). Nevertheless, HCQ has been promoted as a COVID-19 treatment option and

203

became part of multiple recent large-scale clinical trials including one of four initial treatment

204

options in the multinational WHO “Solidarity” clinical trial for COVID-19 (26). However, HCQ

205

treatment does not come without risks as the 4-aminoquinolones are associated with multiple

206

adverse effects such cutaneous adverse reactions, hepatic failure, and ventricular arrythmia;

207

overdose is also difficult to treat (21). The US FDA recently updated its guidance by warning

208

against use of HCQ outside of the hospital setting because of the potential for serious adverse

209

effects (27). Over past weeks, several clinical trials, such as the WHO Solidarity study, have

210

been stopped or have excluded HCQ arms due to a lack of evidence for therapeutic efficacy, and

211

an increase level of adverse effects in COVID-19 patients (26, 28, 29). One influential study that

212

had indicated a detrimental effect of HCQ in COVID-19 patients has subsequently been retracted

213

by the authors due to their inability to confirm the veracity of the data (29, 30), and the Solidarity

214

HCQ arm has been resumed (26). Similarly, a multinational UK-based (COPCOV) HCQ

215

prophylactic trial involving healthcare workers at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection was

216

paused less than a week after starting due to safety concerns (31); the impact of the retraction on

217

the status of this trial remains to be ascertained. Clearly, the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent or

218

reduce infection and thereby impact the clinical course of COVID-19 remains highly contentious

219

at this time.

220

In conclusion, HCQ prophylaxis and treatment had no beneficial effect in the two animal disease

221

models tested. There is always the consideration as to what extent animal data can be extended to

222

the situation in humans, but in general the nonhuman primate models are considered good

223

indicators and the ultimate preclinical models before moving drugs into clinical trials.

224

Independent of the safety issues associated with HCQ, the preclinical data presented here does

225

not support HCQ and likely other 4-aminoquinolines as being either an effective prophylactic

226

treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection or therapeutic for use in COVID-19 patients.

Macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and

344

ocular routes. Animals were treated by oral gavage with either vehicle (PBS) or HCQ (6.5mg/kg

345

in PBS). Administration was either one time per week for the prophylaxis arm or starting 12

346

hours post-infection followed by treatment at 18, 36, 60, 86 and 108 hours post-infection for the

347

treatment arm. Animals were scored for clinical disease twice daily and examinations were
