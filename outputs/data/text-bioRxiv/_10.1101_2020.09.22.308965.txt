Abstract
Pre-existing immune responses to seasonal endemic coronaviruses could have
profound consequences for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, either induced in
natural infection or through vaccination. Such consequences are well established
in the influenza and flavivirus fields. A first step to establish whether pre-existing
responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent
of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. We compared serum antibody and
memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike (S) proteins from pre-pandemic and
SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using a series of binding and functional assays.
We found weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum
antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we found stronger evidence of preexisting cross-reactive memory B cells that were activated on SARS-CoV-2
infection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the donors showed varying
degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS and endemic
coronaviruses. None of the cross-reactive mAbs were neutralizing except for one
that targeted the S2 subunit of the S protein. The results suggest that pre-existing
immunity to endemic coronaviruses should be considered in evaluating antibody
responses to SARS-CoV-2.

Results and discussion
Well-known examples of pre-existing immunity to viruses influencing antibody (Ab)
responses to related viruses include original antigenic sin (OAS) in influenza virus
infections and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in flavivirus infections 1-3. There
is considerable interest in establishing whether Ab or T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2,
through infection or vaccination, might be impacted by pre-existing immunity to other
coronaviruses, particularly the endemic coronaviruses (endemic HCoVs), namely the
betacoronaviruses
(-HCoV),
HCoV-HKU1
and
HCoV-OC43,
and
the
alphacoronaviruses (α-HCoV), HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, which are responsible for
non-severe infections such as common colds 4-8. In principle, pre-existing immune
perturbation effects could occur by interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with cross-reactive
circulating serum Abs or with B cells bearing cross-reactive B cell receptors (BCRs) or T
cells with cross-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs). While a number of studies have reported
on cross-reactive T cells and serum Abs 6,8-12, we investigate here both Ab and BCR
cross-reactivities.
Since individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 will generally also have been
infected with endemic HCoVs, we chose to compare COVID-19 and pre-pandemic donors
in terms of serum Abs and BCRs with specificity for the spike (S) protein. The rationale
was that the pre-pandemic donor cross-reactive responses could only be due to endemic
HCoV infection. However, the COVID-19 cohort could reveal the effects of SARS-CoV-2
infection on cross-reactive responses.
To assess serum Ab S-protein binding in the two cohorts, we used cell-surface and
recombinant soluble S proteins. First, we developed and utilized a high-throughput flow
cytometry-based cell surface spike binding assay (Cell-based ELISA; CELISA). COVID19 convalescent sera from 36 donors showed strong reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike
in the vast majority of infected donors (Fig. 1a, supplementary Fig. 1), somewhat lower
reactivity with the SARS-CoV-1 spike and much lower reactivity with the MERS-CoV spike
in a pattern consistent with sequence conservation between the 3 viruses. COVID sera
also exhibited strong cross-reactivity with endemic HCoV spikes, especially with the
HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 -HCoVs (Fig. 1a). The α-HCoV- derived HCoV-NL63
spike was least reactive among the 4 endemic HCoVs. Next, we tested sera from a cohort
of 36 healthy human donors whose samples were collected pre-pandemic. The sera
showed minimal or no reactivity to SARS-CoV-2/CoV-1 and MERS-CoV spikes but
showed strong binding to the endemic HCoV spikes, especially against the HCoV-HKU1
and HCoV-OC43 -HCoVs (Fig. 1, supplementary Fig. 1). The results suggest that the
pre-pandemic sera, at least in our cohort, possess low levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV2 circulating Abs.
To further investigate, we generated recombinant soluble S proteins of all 7 HCoVs using
a general stabilization strategy described elsewhere 13-15. ELISA showed a similar binding
pattern of the COVID and pre-pandemic sera as the CELISA (Fig. 1B, supplementary Fig.
1). The SARS-CoV-2 S specific binding of COVID sera in the two assay formats (CELISA
versus ELISA) correlated strongly (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) (supplementary Fig. 2), CELISA

being more sensitive overall. We also tested the neutralization of the COVID sera with
SARS-CoV-2 and the ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with both binding
assays (CELISA (r = 0.72, p < 0.0001), ELISA (r = 0.68, p < 0.0001)) (supplementary Fig.
2). Overall, both CELISA and ELISA revealed binding Abs to all 7 HCoV spikes in COVID
sera but only to endemic HCoVs in the pre-pandemic sera.
To assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact serum Ab titers to endemic
HCoVs, we compared Ab titers to endemic HCoV S-protein in sera from COVID and prepandemic cohorts. Higher CELISA Ab titers to endemic HCoV-HKU1 S-protein, but not
for other HCoV spikes (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) were observed in the
COVID cohort compared to the pre-pandemic cohort (supplementary Fig. 3). The result
suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may boost titers to the related HCoV-HKU1 spike
16,17. To further investigate, we divided individuals from the COVID cohort into two groups,
one with the higher SARS-CoV-2 spike Ab titers (AUC > 85,000) and the other with lower
titers (AUC < 85,000). Consistent with the above result, the COVID sera with higher
SARS-CoV-2 titers showed significantly higher binding to HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43
S-proteins compared to the low titer group (supplementary Fig. 3). The α-HCoVs HCoVNL63 and HCoV-229E spike binding antibody titers were comparable between the two
groups and served as a control (supplementary Fig. 3). Since the two cohorts are not
matched in terms of a number of parameters and are of limited size, any conclusions
should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 infection
is apparently associated with enhanced -HCoVs S-protein Ab responses. A key question
is whether the enhanced responses arise from de novo B cell responses or from a recall
response of B cells originally activated by an endemic HCoV virus infection.
We were encouraged to look more closely at the Abs involved by Bio-Layer Interferometry
(BLI). Polyclonal serum antibodies were used as analytes with biotinylated S proteins
captured on streptavidin biosensors. Since the concentrations of the S protein specific
polyclonal Abs in the sera are unknown, these measurements can provide an estimate of
antibody dissociation off-rates (koff, which is antibody concentration independent) but not
binding constants 18. Slower dissociation off-rates would indicate greater affinity
maturation of antibodies with a given S protein 19. It is important to note that the off-rates
are likely associated with bivalent IgG binding (avidity) in the format used. Consistent with
the notion of SARS-CoV-2 infection activating a recall of cross-reactive HCoV S specific
Abs, the COVID sera Abs exhibited significantly slower off-rates with HCoV-HKU1 and
HCoV-NL63 S-proteins compared to pre-pandemic sera Abs (Fig. 2A-B, supplementary
Fig. 4).
Having probed serum cross-reactivity between coronaviruses, we next investigated
memory B cells in COVID individuals. We examined the reactivities of IgG+ memory B
cells in 8 select COVID donors (based on differential binding to HCoV spikes (Fig. 1) with
SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-HKU1 (-HCoV) and HCoV-NL63 (α-HCoV) S-proteins by flow
cytometry. Up to ~8% SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, ~4.3% HCoV-HKU1 S-protein and ~0.6%
for HCoV-NL63 S-protein-specific B cells were identified (Fig. 3B) in a frequency pattern
consistent with serum antibody binding titers.

To probe the specificities of SARS-CoV-2/endemic HCoV cross-reactive Abs, we sorted
single B cells for either SARS-CoV-2/HCoV-HKU-1 or SARS-CoV-2/HCoV-NL63 CoV Sprotein double positivity. We isolated 20 S-protein-specific mAbs from 4 COVID donors,
CC9 (n=3), CC10 (n=3), CC36 (n=6) and CC40 (n=8) (Fig. 3C, supplementary Fig. 5) but
only 5 mAbs, 3 from the CC9 donor and 2 from the CC40 donor, exhibited cross-reactive
binding with HCoV-HKU1 spike (Fig. 3E). Two of the cross-reactive mAbs from the CC9
donor (CC9.1 and CC9.2) were clonally related. All 5 of the SARS-CoV-2/ HCoV-HKU-1
cross-reactive mAbs displayed binding to the genetically related -HCoV, HCoV-OC43,
spike but not to the α-HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, spikes (Fig. 3G,
supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, one mAb (CC9.3) exhibited binding to 5 out of the 7
HCoVs, including the MERS-CoV S-protein (Fig. 3G, supplementary Fig. 6) suggesting
targeting of a highly conserved epitope on -HCoV spikes. One of the 4 SARS-CoV2/HKU1-CoV S cross-reactive mAbs (CC40.8) showed weak cross neutralization against
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 viruses (supplementary Fig. 6). Except for CC9.3 mAb,
all cross-reactive mAbs were encoded by VH3 family gene heavy chains (supplementary
Figs. 5 and 6) and possessed 5.6-13.2% (median = 10.4%) VH and 3.1-4.4% (median =
3.9%) VL nucleotide SHMs (Fig. 3D supplementary Fig. 5).
In principle, the SARS-CoV-2/HCOV-HKU1 S cross-reactive memory B cells could be
pre-existing in the COVID donors and show cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 or originate
from the SARS-CoV-2 infection and show cross-reactivity with HCoV-HKU1 S protein.
The levels of SHM in the 5 cross-reactive mAbs listed above argue for the first
explanation. To gain further insight, we conducted BLI binding studies on the 3 crossreactive mAbs, CC9.2, CC9.3 and CC40.8 (Fig. 4A). Both bivalent IgGs and monovalent
Fabs showed enhanced binding affinity to HCoV-HKU1 S-protein compared to SARSCoV-2 S-protein (Fig. 4A) again consistent with the notion that the Abs (BCRs) arise from
a pre-existing HCoV-HKU1 S response. The serum and BCR data are then consistent.
The data above suggests elevated serum levels of Abs to HCoV-HKU1 S-protein in
COVID donors compared to pre-pandemic donors (Fig. 2A-B) is consistent with the notion
that SARS-CoV-2 activates B cells expressing pre-existing HCoV-HKU1 S-protein
specific BCRs to secrete the corresponding Abs.
One mechanism by which pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies might influence the
course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is ADE. Therefore, we investigated potential ADE of the
3 cross-reactive Abs using a SARS-CoV-2 live virus assay (Fig. 4B). Of the 3 crossreactive antibodies, CC9.3 mAb showed a marginal increase (2-fold) in infection of SARSCoV-2 virus in the FcγRIIa (K562) and FcγRIIb (Daudi) expressing target cells that can
mediate ADE. Further in vivo assessment would be needed to determine if this activity is
associated with any meaningful physiological effects.
To map the epitope specificities of the cross-reactive mAbs, we evaluated binding to a
number of fragments of the S-protein (Fig. 4C-D). Notably, all 5 of the SARS-CoV2/HKU1-CoV cross-reactive mAbs failed to bind any of the S1 subunit domains or
subdomains, suggesting targeting to the more conserved S2 subunit. To identify the
cross-reactive neutralizing epitope recognized by mAb CC40.8, we conducted structural
studies of the antibody with the HKU1-CoV S protein. Using single particle negative stain

electron microscopy (nsEM) we observed that CC40.8 bound to the HCoV-HKU1 S trimer
near the bottom of the S2 domain (Fig. 4E-F). The Fab density in the 2D class averages
was blurry suggesting binding to a flexible surface exposed peptide. The flexibility also
precluded further 3D reconstruction.
Despite the requirement of double positivity in the B cell sorting, 15/20 mAbs were largely
specific for SARS-CoV-2. Again, like cross-reactive mAbs above, the vast majority of
SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs were encoded by VH3 family gene-encoded heavy chains
(Fig. 3C, supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with other studies 20-26. Compared to the crossreactive mAbs, the nucleotide SHM levels in SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs were much
lower (VH, 0-17% (median = 0.7%) VL, 0-3.5% (median = 1.8%)) (Fig. 3D supplementary
Fig. 5). 3 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 S specific mAbs showed neutralization against SARSCoV-2 virus, CC40.1 being the most potent (Fig. 3F, supplementary Fig. 6). Some of the
SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs exhibited cross-reactive binding with SARS-CoV-1 S protein
but none neutralized SARS-CoV-1.
In conclusion, using a range of immune monitoring assays, we compared the serum and
memory B cell responses to the S-protein from all 7 coronaviruses infecting humans in
SARS-CoV-2 donors and in pre-pandemic donors. In sera from our pre-pandemic cohort,
we found no evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 S-protein reactive antibodies that
resulted from endemic HCoV infections. A recent study has however reported the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein reactive antibodies in a small fraction of prepandemic human sera 11. An in-depth examination for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein reactive antibodies in large pre-pandemic human cohorts is warranted to reliably
determine the frequency of such antibodies. Notably, we observed serum levels of
endemic HCoV S-protein antibodies were higher in SARS-CoV-2-experienced donors
and memory B cell studies suggested these likely arose from SARS-CoV-2 infection
activating cross-reactive endemic HCoV S-protein-specific B cells. Cross-reactive mAbs
largely target the more conserved S2 subunit on S-proteins and we identified a SARSCoV-2 cross-neutralizing epitope that could facilitate vaccine design and antibody-based
intervention strategies. Indeed, studies have shown targeting of conserved S2 subunit
neutralizing epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 infected donors and by SARS-CoV-1 nAbs that may
potentially display activities against a broader range of human coronaviruses 27-30.
Overall, our study highlights the need to understand fully the nature of pre-existing
endemic HCoV immunity in large and diverse human cohorts as vaccination of hundreds
of millions of people against COVID-19 is considered.

pre-pandemic human serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S and endemic -HCoV, HCoVHKU1 and α-HCoV, HCoV-NL63 S-proteins. Biotinylated HCoV S-proteins (100nM) were
captured on streptavidin biosensors to achieve binding of at least 1 response unit. The Sprotein-immobilized biosensors were immersed in 1:40 serum dilution solution with serum
antibodies as the analyte and the association (120 s; 180-300) and dissociation (240 s;
300-540) steps were conducted to detect the kinetics of antibody-protein interaction. koff
(1/s) dissociation rates for each antibody-antigen interaction are shown.
B. Off-rates for binding of serum antibodies from COVID donors and from pre-pandemic
donors to SARS-CoV-2 S and endemic HCoV, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, S proteins.
Significantly lower dissociation off-rates are observed for COVID compared to prepandemic sera. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were performed using a
Mann-Whitney test.

Methods
Plasmid construction for full-length and recombinant soluble proteins
To generate full-length human coronavirus plasmids, the spike genes were synthesized
by GeneArt (Life Technologies). The SARS-CoV-1 (1255 amino acids; GenBank:
AAP13567), SARS-CoV-2 (1273 amino acids; GenBank: MN908947), MERS-CoV (1353
amino acids; GenBank: APB87319.1), HCoV-HKU1 (1356 amino acids; GenBank:
YP_173238.1), HCoV-OC43 (1361 amino acids; GenBank: AAX84792.1), HCoV-NL63
(1356 amino acids; GenBank: YP_003767.1) and HCoV-229E (1173 amino acids;
GenBank: NP_073551.1) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector phCMV3
(Genlantis, USA) using PstI and BamH restriction sites. To express the soluble S
ectodomain protein SARS-CoV-1 (residue 1-1190), SARS-CoV-2 (residue 1-1208),
MERS-CoV (residue 1-1291), HCoV-HKU1 (residue 1-1295), HCoV-OC43 (residue 11300) and HCoV-NL63 (residue 1-1291), HCoV-229E (residue 1-1110), the
corresponding DNA fragments were PCR amplified and constructed into vector phCMV3
using a Gibson assembly kit. To trimerize the soluble S proteins and stabilize them in the
prefusion state, we incorporated a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif in the Cterminal of each constructs and two consecutive proline substitutions in the S2 subunit 1315. To be specific, the K968/V969 in SARS-CoV-1, the K986/V987 in SARS-CoV-2, the
V1060/L1061 in MERS-CoV, the A1071/L1072 in HCoV-HKU1, the A1078/L1079 in
HCoV-OC43, the S1052/I1053 in HCoV-NL63 and the T871/I872 in HCoV-229E were
replaced by proline residues. Additionally, the S2 cleavage sites in each protein were
replaced with a “GSAS” linker peptide. To facilitate the purification and biotin labeling of
the soluble protein, the HRV-3C protease cleavage site, 6X HisTag, and AviTag spaced
by GS-linkers were added to the C-terminus of the constructs, as needed. To express the
SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal domain-NTD (residue 1-290), receptor-binding domain-RBD
(residue 320-527), RBD-SD1 (residue 320-591), and RBD-SD1-2 (residue 320-681)
subdomains, we amplified the DNA fragments by PCR reaction using the SARS-CoV-2
plasmid as template. All the DNA fragments were cloned into the vector phCMV3
(Genlantis, USA) in frame with the original secretion signal or the Tissue Plasminogen
Activator (TPA) leader sequence. All the truncation proteins were fused to the C-terminal
6X HisTag, and AviTag spaced by GS-linkers to aid protein purification and biotinylation.
Expression and purification of the proteins
To express the soluble S ectodomain proteins of each human coronavirus and the
truncated versions, the plasmids were transfected into FreeStyle293F cells (Thermo
Fisher). For general production, 350 ug plasmids were transfected into 1L FreeStyle293F
cells at the density of 1 million cells/mL. We mixed 350 ug plasmids with 16mL
transfectagro™ (Corning) and 1.8 mL 40K PEI (1mg/mL) with 16mL transfectagro™ in
separate 50 mL conical tubes. We filtered the plasmid mixture with 0.22 μm Steriflip™
Sterile Disposable Vacuum Filter Units (MilliporeSigma™) before combining it with the
PEI mixture. After gently mixing the two components, the combined solution rested at
room temperature for 30 min and was poured into 1 L FreeStyle293F cell culture. To
harvest the soluble proteins, the cell cultures were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min on
day 4 after transfection. The supernatants were filtered through the 0.22 μm membrane
and stored in a glass bottle at 4 ℃ before purification. The His-tagged proteins were

purified with the HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Fisher). To eliminate nonspecific binding
proteins, each column was washed with at least 3 bed volumes of wash buffer (25 mM
Imidazole, pH 7.4). To elute the purified proteins from the column, we loaded 25 mL of
the elution buffer (250 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4) at slow gravity speed (~4 sec/drop).
Proteins without His tags were purified with GNL columns (Vector Labs). The bound
proteins were washed with PBS and then eluted with 50 mL of 1M Methyl α-Dmannopyranoside (Sigma M6882-500G) in PBS. By using Amicon tubes, we buffer
exchanged the solution with PBS and concentrated the proteins. The proteins were
further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300
GL column (GE Healthcare). The selected fractions were pooled and concentrated again
for further use.
Biotinylation of proteins
Random biotinylation of S proteins was conducted using EZ-Link NHS-PEG Solid-Phase
Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Scientific #21440). 10ul DMSO were added per tube for making
concentrated biotin stock, 1ul of which were diluted into 170ul water before use.
Coronavirus spike proteins were concentrated to 7-9 mg/ml using 100K Amicon tubes in
PBS, then aliquoted into 30ul in PCR tubes. 3ul of the diluted biotin were added into each
aliquot of concentrated protein and incubated on ice for 3h. After reaction, buffer
exchange for the protein was performed using PBS to remove excess biotin. BirA
biotinylation of S proteins was conducted using BirA biotin-protein ligase bulk reaction kit
(Avidity). Coronavirus S proteins with Avi-tags were concentrated to 7-9 mg/ml using
100K Amicon tubes in TBS, then aliquoted into 50ul in PCR tubes. 7.5ul of BioB Mix, 7.5ul
of Biotin200, and 5ul of BirA ligase (3mg/ml) were added per tube. The mixture was
incubated on ice for 3h, followed by size-exclusion chromatography to segregate the
biotinylated protein and the excess biotin. The extend of biotinylation was evaluated by
BioLayer Interferometry binding value using streptavidin biosensors.
CELISA binding
Binding of serum antibodies or mAbs to human coronavirus spike proteins expressed on
HEK293T cell surface was determined by flow cytometry, as described previously 31.
HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding full-length coronavirus spikes
including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoVNL63 and HCoV-229E. Transfected cells were incubated for 36-48 h at 37°C. Post
incubation cells were trypsinized to prepare a single cell suspension and were distributed
into 96-well plates. Serum samples were prepared as 3-fold serial titrations in FACS
buffer (1x PBS, 2% FBS, 1 mM EDTA), starting at 1:30 dilution, 6 dilutions. 50 μl/well of
the diluted samples were added into the cells and incubated on ice for 1h. The plates
were washed twice in FACS buffer and stained with 50 μl/well of 1:200 dilution of Rphycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG Fc antibody (SouthernBiotech
#9040-09) and 1:1000 dilution of Zombie-NIR viability dye (BioLegend) on ice in dark for
45min. After another two washes, stained cells were analyzed using flow cytometry (BD
Lyrics cytometers), and the binding data were generated by calculating the percent (%)
PE-positive cells for antigen binding using FlowJo 10 software. CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibody, and dengue antibody, DEN3, were used as
positive and negative controls for the assay, respectively.

ELISA binding
96-well half-area plates (Corning cat. #3690, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated
overnight at 4°C with 2 ug/ml of mouse anti-His-tag antibody (Invitrogen cat. #MA121315-1MG, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS plus
0.05% Tween20 (PBST) and blocked with 3% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS for 1 h. After removal of the blocking buffer, the plates were incubated with Histagged spike proteins at a concentration of 5 ug/ml in 1% BSA plus PBS-T for 1.5 hr at
room temperature. After a washing step, perturbed and lotus serum samples were added
in 3-fold serial dilutions in 1% BSA/PBS-T starting from 1:30 and 1:40 dilution,
respectively, and incubated for 1.5 hr. CR3022 and DEN3 human antibodies were used
as a positive and negative control, respectively, and added in 3-fold serial dilutions in 1%
BSA/PBS-T starting at 10 ug/ml. After the washes, a secondary antibody conjugated with
alkaline phosphatase (AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG Fc fragment specific, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories cat. #109-055-008) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS-T,
was added to each well. After 1 h of incubation, the plates were washed and developed
using alkaline phosphatase substrate pNPP tablets (Sigma cat. #S0942-200TAB)
dissolved in a stain buffer. The absorbance was measured after 8, 20, and 30 minutes,
and was recorded at an optical density of 405 nm (OD405) using a VersaMax microplate
reader (Molecular Devices), where data were collected using SoftMax software version
5.4. The wells without the addition of serum served as a background control.
BioLayer Interferometry binding
An Octet K2 system (ForteBio) was used for performing the binding experiments of the
coronavirus spike proteins with serum samples. All serum samples were prepared in
Octet buffer (PBS plus 0.1% Tween20) as 1:40 dilution, random-biotinylated S proteins
were prepared at a concentration of 100nM. The hydrated streptavidin biosensors
(ForteBio) first captured the biotinylated spike proteins for 60s, then transferred into Octet
buffer for 60s to remove unbound protein and provide the baseline. Then, they were
immersed in diluted serum samples for 120s to provide association signal, followed by
transferring into Octet buffer to test for disassociation signal for 240s. The data generated
was analyzed using the ForteBio Data Analysis software for correction and curve fitting,
and for calculating the antibody dissociation rates (koff values) or KD values for
monoclonal antibodies.
Flow cytometry B cell profiling and mAb isolation with HCoV S proteins
Flow cytometry of PBMC samples from convalescent human donors were conducted
following methods described previously 22,32,33. Frozen human PBMCs were resuspended in 10 ml RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #11875085) prewarmed to 37°C containing 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After centrifugation at 400 x g
for 5 minutes, the cells were resuspended in a 5 ml FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 2mM
EDTA) and counted. A mixture of fluorescently labeled antibodies to cell surface markers
was prepared, including antibodies specific for the T cell markers CD3(APC Cy7, BD
Pharmingen #557757), CD4(APC-Cy7, Biolegend #317418) and CD8(APC-Cy7, BD
Pharmingen #557760); B cell markers CD19 (PerCP-Cy5.5, Fisher Scientific
#NC9963455), IgG(BV605, BD Pharmingen #563246) and IgM(PE); CD14(APC-Cy7, BD

Pharmingen #561384, clone M5E2). The cells were incubated with the antibody mixture
for 15 minutes on ice in the dark. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein was conjugated to
streptavidin-AF488 (Life Technologies #S11223), the HCoV-HKU1 S protein to
streptavidin-BV421 (BD Pharmingen #563259) and the HCoV-NL63 S protein to
streptavidin-AF647 (Life Technologies #S21374). Following conjugation, each S proteinprobe was added to the Ab-cell mixture and incubated for 30 minutes on ice in the dark.
FVS510 Live/Dead stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #L34966) in the FACS buffer (1:300)
was added to the cells and incubated on ice in the dark for 15 minutes. The stained cells
were washed with FACS buffer and re-suspended in 500 μl of FACS buffer/10-20 million
cells, passed through a 70 μm mesh cap FACS tube (Fisher Scientific, #08-771-23) and
sorted using a Beckman Coulter Astrios sorter, where memory B cells specific to S protein
proteins were isolated. In brief, after the gating of lymphocytes (SSC-A vs. FSC-A) and
singlets (FSC-H vs. FSC-A), live cells were identified by the negative FVS510 Live/Dead
staining phenotype, then antigen-specific memory B cells were distinguished with
sequential gating and defined as CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD14-, CD19+, IgM-and IgG+.
Subsequently, the S protein specific B cells were identified with the phenotype of
AF488+BV421+ (SARS-CoV-2/HCoV-HKU1 S protein double positive) or
AF488+AF647+ (SARS-CoV-2/HCoV-NL63 S protein double positive). Positive memory
B cells were then sorted and collected at single cell density in 96-well plates. Downstream
single cell IgG RT-PCR reactions were conducted using Superscript IV Reverse
Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher, # 18090050), random hexamers (Gene Link # 26400003),
Ig gene-specific primers, dNTP, Igepal, DTT and RNAseOUT (Thermo Fisher #
10777019). cDNA products were then used in nested PCR for heavy/light chain variable
region amplification with HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN # 203643) and
specific primer sets described previously 34,35. The second round PCR exploited primer
sets for adding on the overlapping region with the expression vector, followed by cloning
of the amplified variable regions into vectors containing constant regions of IgG1, Ig
Kappa, or Ig Lambda using Gibson assembly enzyme mix (New England Biolabs
#E2621L) after confirming paired amplified product on 96-well E gel (ThermoFisher
#G720801). Gibson assembly products were finally transformed into competent E.coli
cells and single colonies were picked for sequencing and analysis on IMGT V-Quest
online tool (http://www.imgt.org) as well as downstream plasmid production for antibody
expression.
Neutralization assay
Under BSL2/3 conditions, MLV-gag/pol and MLV-CMV plasmids were co-transfected into
HEK293T cells along with full-length or variously truncated SARS-CoV1 and SARS-COV2
spike plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 to produce single-round of infection competent
pseudo-viruses. The medium was changed 16 hours post transfection. The supernatant
containing MLV-pseudotyped viral particles was collected 48h post transfection, aliquoted
and frozen at -80 °C for neutralization assay. Pseudotyped viral neutralization assay was
performed as previously described with minor modification (Modified from TZM-bl assay
protocol 36). 293T cells were plated in advance overnight with DMEM medium +10% FBS
+ 1% Pen/Strep + 1% L-glutamine. Transfection was done with Opti-MEM transfection
medium (Gibco, 31985) using Lipofectamine 2000. The medium was changed 12 hours
after transfection. Supernatants containing the viruses were harvested 48h after

transfection. 1) Neutralization assay for plasma. plasma from COVID donors were heatinactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes. In sterile 96-well half-area plates, 25μl of virus was
immediately mixed with 25 μl of serially diluted (3x) plasma starting at 1:10 dilution and
incubated for one hour at 37°C to allow for antibody neutralization of the pseudotyped
virus. 10,000 HeLa-hACE2 cells/ well (in 50ul of media containing 20μg/ml Dextran) were
directly added to the antibody virus mixture. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 42 to 48
h. Following the infection, HeLa-hACE2 cells were lysed using 1x luciferase lysis buffer
(25mM Gly-Gly pH 7.8, 15mM MgSO4, 4mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). Luciferase
intensity was then read on a Luminometer with luciferase substrate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, PR-E2620). 2) Neutralization assay for
monoclonal antibodies. In 96-well half-area plates, 25ul of virus was added to 25ul of fivefold serially diluted mAb (starting concentration of 50ug/ml) and incubated for one hour
before adding HeLa-ACE2 cell as mentioned above. Percentage of neutralization was
calculated using the following equation: 100 X (1 – (MFI of sample – average MFI of
background) / average of MFI of probe alone – average MFI of background)).
Antibody dependent enhancement assay
Ex vivo antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) quantification was measured using a
focus reduction neutralization assay. Monoclonal antibodies were serially diluted in
complete RPMI and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with SARS-CoV-2 strain USAWA1/2020 (BEI Resources NR- 52281) [MOI=.01], in a BSL3 facility. Following the initial
incubation, the mAb-virus complex was added in triplicate to 384-well plates seeded with
1E4 of K562 or Daudi cells and were incubated at 34°C for 24 hours. 20µL of the
supernatant was transferred to a 384-well plate seeded with 2E3 HeLa-ACE2 cells and
incubated for an additional 24 hours at 34°C. Plates were fixed with 25 ul of 8%
formaldehyde for 1 hour at 34°C. Plates were washed 3 times with 1xPBS 0.05% Tween20 following fixation. 10µL of human polyclonal sera diluted 1:500 in Perm/Wash Buffer
(BD Biosciences)was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 2 hours. The plates were
then washed 3 times with 1xPBS 0.05% Tween-20 and stained with peroxidase goat antihuman Fab (Jackson Scientific, 109-035-006) diluted 1:2000 in Perm/wash buffer then
incubated at RT for 2 hours. The plates were then washed 3 times with 1xPBS 0.05%
Tween-20. 10µL of Perm/Wash buffer was added to the plate then incubated for 15
minutes at RT. The Perm/Wash buffer was removed and 10µL of TrueBlue peroxidase
substrate (KPL) was added. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at RT then washed
once with milli-Q water. The FFU per well was then quantified using a compound
microscope. The PFU/mL of the monocyte plate supernatant was calculated and graphed
using Prism 8 software.
Negative Stain Electron Microscopy
The HCoV-HKU1 S protein was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of Fab CC40.8 for
30 mins at room temperature and diluted to 0.03 mg/ml in 1X TBS pH 7.4. 3 μL of the
diluted sample was deposited on a glow discharged copper mesh grid, blotted off, and
stained for 55 seconds with 2% uranyl formate. Proper stain thickness and particle density
was assessed on a FEI Morgagni (80keV). The Leginon software 37 was used to automate
data collection on a FEI Tecnai Spirit (120keV), paired a FEI Eagle 4k x 4k camera. The
following parameters were used: 52,000x magnification, -1.5 μm defocus, a pixel size of

2.06 Å, and a dose of 25 e−/Å2. Micrographs were stored in the Appion database 38,
particles were picked using DogPicker 39, and a particle stack of 256 pixels was made.
RELION 3.0 40 was used to generate the 2D class averages. The flexibility of the fab
relative to the spike precluded 3D reconstruction.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 8 for Mac, Graph Pad
Software, San Diego, California, USA. Median area-under-the-curve (AUC) or reciprocal
50% binding (ID50) or neutralization (IC50) titers were compared using the nonparametric unpaired Mann-Whitney-U test. The correlation between two groups was
determined by Spearman rank test. Data were considered statistically significant at * p <
0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, and **** p < 0.0001.
