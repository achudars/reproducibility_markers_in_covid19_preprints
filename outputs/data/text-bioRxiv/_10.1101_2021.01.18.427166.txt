Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2, a novel lineage of the coronavirus causing COVID-19, contains multiple mutations
within two immunodominant domains of the spike protein. Here we show that this lineage exhibits
complete escape from three classes of therapeutically relevant monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore
501Y.V2 shows substantial or complete escape from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent
plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and may
foreshadow reduced efficacy of current spike-based vaccines.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide1,2. Infected individuals
develop neutralizing antibodies that can persist for months3-5. Neutralizing antibodies are considered the
primary correlate of protection against reinfection for most vaccines, including SARS-CoV-26,7, and are
being actively pursued as therapeutics8,9.
The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) is the dominant target of the neutralizing response during
infection7,10-13. Consequently, the overwhelming majority of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies isolated
thus far from infected individuals, immunoglobulin libraries, or immunized animal models, target this
region10,11,13,14. These antibodies can be broadly divided into four main classes15, of which class 1 and class
2 antibodies target site I10 epitopes that overlap with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor
binding site. Class 1 antibodies are most frequently elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and are comprised
almost entirely of immunoglobulin V-gene (VH3-53/66) germline restricted antibodies, forming a multidonor class with highly similar epitopes only accessible in the RBD ‘up’ conformation11,15,16. Class 2
antibodies also bind to site I10,15, but can bind to both RBD ‘up’ and RBD ‘down’ conformations of spike.
Although they can use a more diverse VH-gene pool, class 2 antibodies include VH1-2 germline restricted
antibodies that form a second commonly elicited multi-donor class of public antibodies17. The RBD is also
the target of several nanobodies/sybodies that are being considered for clinical development18,19.
After the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike is the next most frequently targeted by neutralizing
antibodies, and several potent monoclonal antibodies to this region also being considered for clinical
development20-22. Remarkably, despite being derived from diverse VH-genes, almost all these antibodies
target a single immunodominant site on NTD, involving the N1-loop (NTD N-terminus), N3-loop (supersite
β-hairpin), and N5-loop (supersite loop). A subset of these antibodies also forms a third multi-donor class,
with a common VH1-24 germline restricted mode of spike recognition.
We, and others, recently described the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage in South Africa, 501Y.V2,
that included nine changes in the spike protein. These can be divided into two subsets, one cluster in NTD
that includes four substitutions and a deletion (L18F, D80A, D215G, Δ242-244, and R246I), and another
cluster of three substitutions in RBD (K417N, E484K, and N501Y). Although the 501Y change has been
associated with increased transmissibility, rather than immune pressure, the accumulation of mutations
specifically within these two immunodominant regions of spike is highly suggestive of escape from
neutralization. Indeed, mutations at 484 have been shown to reduce neutralization sensitivity23,24.
Furthermore, mutations in these same regions have also been described in a new variant, which has
recently emerged independently in Brazil25. Lastly, variants in the UK and USA, albeit with fewer potential
antibody escape mutations have also been described, suggesting the global emergence of new SARS-CoV2 variants26.
Here we show that spike mutations in the 501Y.V2 lineage confer neutralization escape from multiple
classes of SARS-CoV-2 directed monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, we observe significantly increased
neutralization resistance of 501Y.V2 to plasma from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with
implications for both rates of re-infection, and vaccine effectiveness.

Results
The SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage escapes monoclonal antibodies to dominant RBD epitopes. To evaluate
the impact of 501Y.V2 spike amino acid changes on commonly elicited neutralizing specificities, we first
assessed neutralization sensitivity of the 501Y.V2 lineage to monoclonal antibodies. An analysis of twelve
class I antibody structures revealed their epitopes to be centred on spike residue K417 (Fig.1a), which is
one of three mutations in the RBD of the 501Y.V2 lineage. Class 1 antibodies buried between 60-100% of
the K417 side chain accessible surface area in their paratopes and included key hydrogen bonds at this
site (Fig.1b). Three representative class 1 antibodies, CA1, LyCoV016 (also known as CB6 or JS016), and
CC12.1, were assessed by ELISA for binding to the RBD of both the original and 501Y.V2 lineages. All three
antibodies achieved saturated binding to the original lineage but were unable to bind 501Y.V2 RBD at 10
μg/mL (Fig.1c). Similarly, when assessed in a lentivirus-pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, all
three antibodies potently neutralized the original lineage, but were unable to neutralize the 501Y.V2
variant (at 25 μg/mL), confirming dependence on the K417 residue (Fig.1d).
An analysis of eight class 2 antibodies and five nanobodies/sybodies to this site, revealed key interactions
with spike residue E484 which buried between 75%-100% of its side chain accessible surface area in their
paratopes, and formed critical hydrogen bonds or charged interactions at this site (Fig.1e). As with the
class 1 antibodies, three representative class 2 antibodies (BD23, C119, and P2B-2F6) failed to bind to
501Y.V2 RBD (Fig.1f) and were unable to neutralize the 501Y.V2 pseudovirus (Fig.1g). These data add to
growing evidence implicating E484K (found in 501Y.V2) in escape from a broad array of class 2 antibodies.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage has effectively escaped two major classes of neutralizing antibodies
targeting an immunodominant, highly antigenic site in the RBD of the spike protein.
A three amino acid deletion in 501Y.V2 dramatically alters the antigenic landscape of a supersite in NTD.
In addition to changes in RBD, 501Y.V2 is also defined by several changes in the NTD. These include a three
amino acid deletion in the N-terminus of a relatively large, solvent exposed loop in NTD variably defined
as the N5-loop (residues 246-260)20,21, or the supersite loop (residues 245-264)22. An analysis of the
monoclonal antibody 4A8-bound spike structure showed that roughly half (47%) of the neutralization
interface with spike was buried in the N5-loop supersite (Fig.1h). 4A8 is part of the VH1-24 restricted class
of NTD neutralizing antibodies, with a common mode of recognition involving key CDR-H1 mediated
interactions with N5-loop residue R24620. Strikingly, most NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies to SARSCoV-2 recognize epitopes that incorporate the N5-loop supersite and interact with key residues R246 or
D253 (Fig.1i). Modelling the 501Y.V2 N5-loop onto the 4A8-bound spike structure revealed an apical loop
displacement of at least 8Å away from the 4A8 paratope (Fig.1j). In addition, the deletion would shift
position R246 three amino acids earlier in the registry, bringing it into proximity with R102 and creating a
potential clash that would locally disrupt the N5-loop conformation and shift it even further from the 4A8
paratope. When assessed in ELISA, 4A8 was unable to bind to recombinant 501Y.V2 NTD at the highest
concentration tested, suggesting that 501Y.V2 effectively escapes antibodies to the N5-loop supersite
(Fig.1k).

The SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage shows high levels of resistance to convalescent plasma/sera. We next
sought to evaluate the effect of 501Y.V2 spike mutations on polyclonal plasma/sera derived from
individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, including individuals who were hospitalised for severe COVID-19.
Samples were divided into two groups, half with higher titre neutralizing antibodies (22 of 44, ID50 >400)
and half with lower titres (22 of 44, 400 >ID50 >25) to the original SARS-CoV-2 D614G lineage (Fig.2a - left).
Consistent with previous studies27, when stratified by disease severity, convalescent individuals who
reported mild to moderate disease developed substantially lower neutralizing antibody titres (average
ID50 titre 488, n=30) than severely ill individuals from the hospitalized cohorts (average ID50 titre 4212,
n=14).
When these same samples were assessed against the 501Y.V2 virus, nearly half (21 of 44, 48%) had no
detectable neutralization activity, with only three samples (7%) retaining titres of ID50 >400 (Fig.2a - right).
Notably, all three of these samples were obtained from individuals reporting severe disease who had
some of the highest neutralization titres against the original virus. To define the location of dominant
escape mutations, neutralization was also assessed against the RBD chimeric viral construct containing
only three 501Y.V2 mutations (K417N, E484K, N501Y) (Fig.2a - middle). A substantial loss of neutralization
was also observed against the RBD-only mutant, with 27% of the samples losing all activity against the
RBD triple mutants, while only 23% retained higher titres of ID50 >400. These data provide more evidence
for the dominance of Class 1 and Class 2 neutralizing antibodies in polyclonal sera. However, the
differences in neutralization between the RBD-only chimera and 501Y.V2 also highlight the contribution
of 501Y.V2 NTD mutations (L18F, D80A, D215G, and Δ242-244) to neutralization escape. This was
particularly evident in the higher titre samples, which retained an average titre of ID50 680 against the
RBD-only mutant.
Convalescent plasma/serum retains high levels of binding antibodies to 501Y.V2 RBD. While neutralizing
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are dominated by the specificities defined above, non-neutralizing antibodies
are also elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection10,12. To determine whether 501Y.V2 is still recognized by nonneutralizing antibodies, the binding of polyclonal sera (from Fig.2a) to a recombinant 501Y.V2 RBD+SBD1
protein and an RBD+SBD1 from the original lineage was assessed by ELISA (Fig.2b). These data revealed
that binding of polyclonal plasma to 501Y.V2 RBD+SBD1 was only substantially affected in a minority of
cases (14 of 44 with ≥five-fold reduction, 32%). Most of the convalescent plasma/serum suffered less than
four-fold reductions in total binding activity (as measured by area under the curve), suggesting a
considerable non-neutralizing antibody component are still able to bind the 501Y.V2 spike antigen.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, with new lineages being
reported all over the world. Amongst previous lineages, D614G was shown to have faster growth in vitro,
enhanced transmission in small animals, and has subsequently become globally dominant28-30. N501Y has
been shown to increase affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which together with the repeated and
independent evolution of 501Y containing lineages25,26,31, strongly argues for enhanced transmissibility of
these new variants. Here we show that the 501Y.V2 lineage, that contains nine spike mutations, and
rapidly emerged in South Africa during the second half of 2020, is largely resistant to neutralizing
antibodies elicited by infection with previously circulating lineages. This suggests that, despite the many
people who have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 globally and are presumed to have accumulated
some level of immunity, new variants such as 501Y.V2 pose a significant re-infection risk.
While higher titres of neutralizing antibodies are common in hospitalized individuals, however most SARSCoV-2 infected people develop moderate neutralization titres3-5. Therefore, the data herein suggest that
most individuals infected with previous SARS-CoV-2 lineages will have minimal or no detectable
neutralization activity against 501Y.V2. This dramatic effect on plasma neutralization can be explained by
the dominance of RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies10,11,13. These data are supported by studies
showing reduced plasma neutralization titres mediated by the E484K change alone23,24. Importantly, here
we show that the K417N change also has a crucial role in viral escape, effectively abrogating neutralization
by a well-defined, multi-donor class of VH3-53/66 germline restricted public antibodies that comprise
some of the most common and potent neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-211,17.
The marked loss of neutralization against 501Y.V2 compared to the RBD-only chimeric virus demonstrates
the important role that mutations in the NTD play in mediating immune escape. While the L18F change
(found in 501Y.V2) has previously been linked to neutralization resistance22, we also define an important
role for a relatively small, three amino acid deletion in the 501Y.V2 NTD domain that completely disrupts
a dominant public antibody response to the N5-loop supersite20-22. This deletion predominates among
501Y.V2 variants, and occurs either alone or with an R246I substitution that has also been shown to
abrogate neutralization by several NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies22.
A recently identified lineage in Brazil also has changes at key positions shown here to affect neutralizing
antibodies (417T, 484K in RBD and 18F, 20N in NTD - the last mutation adding a glycosylation sequon)25.
Our data suggest that this lineage is also likely to exhibit significant levels of neutralization resistance,
making both lineages of considerable public health concern. The independent emergence and subsequent
selection for two distinct 501Y lineages with key mutations conferring neutralization resistance strongly
argues for selection by neutralizing antibodies as the dominant driver for SARS-CoV-2 spike diversification.
The relatively rapid acquisition of a comprehensive suite of neutralization escape mutations likely
occurred because of the large number of commonly shared public antibodies (eg: VH3-53/66, VH1-2, VH124) to both the RBD and NTD of spike, together with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the
world. The sporadic emergence of escape mutations in long-term viral shedders, including
immunocompromised individuals, may also contribute to the emergence of neutralization resistant
viruses32. Altogether, these data highlight the need for increased, ongoing surveillance and sequencing
during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Crucially, it is from these same public antibody responses that many therapeutic strategies currently under
development have been derived8,9,33. The overwhelming majority of monoclonal antibodies already on

the path to licensure target residues K417 or E484 and will therefore be ineffective against 501Y.V2.
Amongst these antibodies, some have already been granted emergency use authorization in the USA
(Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly and Company). In addition, a next generation of potent
neutralizing antibodies that target the NTD N5-loop supersite have been suggested for clinical
development but are also likely to be futile against 501Y.V2.
These data also have implications for the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which are principally
based on immune responses to the spike protein. Neutralizing antibodies have repeatedly been
demonstrated as the primary correlate of protection for most vaccines, including those designed to
prevent infection with respiratory pathogens34. Despite neutralization escape, we show here that a
significant proportion of non-neutralizing, RBD binding antibodies remain active against 501Y.V2. While
antibody effector functions elicited by infection and vaccination have been implicated in protecting from
reinfection and disease35,36, the role of non-neutralizing antibodies and the efficacy of T cell responses to
501Y.V2 remain to be elucidated. Ultimately, the correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection
and severe COVID-19 disease remain undetermined and rely upon ongoing large-scale clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the speed and scope of 501Y.V2 mediated immune escape from pre-existing neutralizing
antibodies highlight the urgent requirement for rapidly adaptable vaccine design platforms, and the need
to identify less mutable viral targets for incorporation into future immunogens.

Materials and Methods
Samples and ethics approvals
Plasma/serum samples were obtained from HIV negative individuals enrolled into one of three studies
described below.
Hospitalised Steve Biko Cohort. This study has been given ethics approval by the University of Pretoria,
Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) (247/2020). Serum samples were obtained (longitudinally)
from hospitalized patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, known HIV status and aged ≥18
years. Samples from six participants with symptom onset between May-August 2020 and were used.
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) viral shedding and clinical characterization study. This study has been given
ethics approval by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical)
M160667. Serum samples were obtained (longitudinally) from hospitalized patients with PCR confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, known HIV status and aged ≥18 years. Samples from six participants with symptom
onset between May-September 2020 and were used.
SANBS. Plasma were obtained from blood donors of the South African National Blood Service (ethics
clearance from SANBS Human Research Ethics Committee 2019/0519), who had PCR confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection, had recovered and were at least 28 days post-symptom onset. All donors met the
standard eligibility criteria for donors who donate source plasma, which includes being generally healthy,
being older than 18-years of age, weighing more than 55kg and leading a lifestyle that reduces risk of
acquiring transfusion transmissible infections. Only male and nulliparous females were accepted as CCP
donors.
Structural modelling
The closed prefusion SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was modelled on PDBID 6VXX37, while a model of the RBD
was averaged from Nab bound structures from PDBID 6LZG, 6WPS, 6XE1, 7BZ5, 7C01, 7JMP, 7K8M, 7K8S,
7K8U, 7K8V, 7K8W, 7JMO, 7K8X, 7K8Z, 7K90, 7BYR, 6WPS, and 6XDG. The 501Y.V2 NTD domain was
modelled using both antibody constrained (PDBID 7C2L21) and unconstrained structures of Spike
deposited in the protein databank38. Buried interfaces were calculated using PDBePISA
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/pistart.html) and structures were visualized in PyMol39.
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 antigens
Monoclonal antibodies or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD+SBD1 or NTD proteins were transfected in
FreeStyle 293F suspension cells (Life Technologies) using PEIMAX transfection reagent (Polysciences).
Transfections were incubated at 220 rpm, 37 °C, 9% CO2 for 6-7 days, and clarified supernatants were
purified using nickel affinity or protein A and size-exclusion chromatography.
ELISA
Recombinant RBD+SBD1 proteins were coated at 2 μg/ml onto 96-well, high-binding plates, and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then washed and incubated at 37 °C for 1-2 hours in blocking buffer
(5% skimmed milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20, 1x PBS). Plasma samples were added at 1:100 and serially
diluted 5-fold in blocking buffer. Following a 1-hour incubation at 37 °C, an anti-human horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added for 1-hour at 37 °C. The signal was developed with TMB
substrate (Thermofisher Scientific) for 5 minutes at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1M

H2SO4 stop solution. Absorbance at 450nm was measured and used to calculate area under the curve
(AUC) using Graphpad Prism v8.4.2.
Lentiviral pseudovirus production and neutralization assay
293T/ACE2.MF cells modified to overexpress human ACE2 were kindly provided by Dr Mike Farzan, Scripps
Research. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco BRL Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated
FBS and 3 μg/mL puromycin at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cell monolayers were disrupted at confluency by treatment
with 0.25% trypsin in 1 mM EDTA (Gibco BRL Life Technologies).
The SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan-1 spike, cloned into pCDNA3.1 was mutated using the QuikChange Lightning SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) to include D614G (original) or K417N, E484K, N501Y,
D614G (RBD only) or L18F, D80A, D215G, Δ242-244, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V (501Y.V2).
Pseudoviruses were produced by co-transfection with a lentiviral backbone (HIV-1 pNL4.luc encoding the
firefly luciferase gene) and either of the SARS-CoV-2 spike plasmids with PEIMAX (Polysicences). Culture
supernatants were clarified of cells by 0.45μM filter and sored at -70°C.
Plasma/serum samples were heat-inactivated and clarified by centrifugation. Pseudovirus and serially
diluted plasma/sera were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were added at 1x104 cells per well
after 72 hours incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2, luminescence was measured using PerlinElmer Life Sciences
Model Victor X luminometer. Neutralization was measured as described by a reduction in luciferase gene
expression after single-round infection of 293T/ACE2.MF cells with spike-pseudotyped viruses. Titers were
calculated as the reciprocal plasma dilution (ID50) causing 50% reduction of relative light units (RLU).
Equivalency was established through participation in the SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Assay Concordance
Survey (SNACS) Concordance Survey 1 (CS1) run by EQAPOL and VQU, Duke Human Vaccine Institute.
