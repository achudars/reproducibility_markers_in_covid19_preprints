Abstract
Immunomodulatory agents dexamethasone and colchicine, antiviral drugs
remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin, as well as antimalarial drugs chloroquine
phosphate and hydroxychloroquine are currently used in the combat against
COVID-191-16. However, whether some of these drugs have clinical efficacy for
COVID-19 is under debate. Moreover, these drugs are applied in COVID-19 patients
with little knowledge of genetic biomarkers, which will hurt patient outcome. To answer
these questions, we designed a screen approach that could employ genome-wide
sgRNA libraries to systematically uncover genes crucial for these drugs’ action. Here
we present our findings, including genes crucial for the import, export, metabolic
activation and inactivation of remdesivir, as well as genes that regulate colchicine and
dexamethasone’s immunosuppressive effects. Our findings provide preliminary
information for developing urgently needed genetic biomarkers for these drugs. Such
biomarkers will help better interpret COVID-19 clinical trial data and point to how to
stratify COVID-19 patients for proper treatment with these drugs.

Introduction
In response to the surging COVID-19 pandemic, several drugs have been
reported to show efficacy in COVID-19 patients, but clear conclusions on some of
them are still lacking. Among these drugs, dexamethasone and colchicine serve to
suppress excessive immune response that damages tissues and organs in severe
COVID-19 cases. Antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin interfere
with viral RNA polymerase and inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Antimalarial
drugs chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine, whose use in COVID-19 is
more controversial, suppress both immune response and viral replication. Currently
little is known about the genetic biomarkers that modulate these drugs’ efficacy. Such
knowledge is urgently needed to better manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
Several groups of cellular proteins may affect drug efficacy. The list includes drug
transporters, drug metabolizing enzymes, proteins that compete with the intended
therapeutic target for drug binding, as well as proteins that mitigate or exacerbate
drug-induced damage. Such proteins may differentially regulate the cellular stresses
caused by a drug. If the stresses caused by COVID-19 drugs could result in massive
cell death, it will be possible to capture genes that modify drug efficacy by analyzing
cells that survived drug treatment (Fig. 1a).
However, most of the drugs used in COVID-19 treatment are not cytotoxic. They
cannot efficiently kill commonly used cell lines even at very high concentrations (Fig.
1b), making it very difficult to conduct genome-wide screens. For antiviral drugs, there
are additional difficulties that prevented large-scale screens. For example, if a
sgRNA-mediated gene knockout in a host cell makes remdesivir more effective at
suppressing viral replication, there is just no effective means to isolate that cell from
other cells. Therefore, looking at drug’s direct impact on viral replication per se in a
pool-based large screen is hardly executable. As a result, no genome-wide screen
studies on antiviral drugs have been reported and there is very little knowledge on
genetic biomarkers for these groups of important drugs. In this report, we developed a
screen platform that could effectively solve the above problems. Using such a
platform, we performed genome-wide screening on COVID-19 drugs and identified

genes that critically regulate these drugs’ activities. Screen results for these drugs are
presented separately, with validation experiments shown at the end of this report.

Results

Screen system. The Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cell line represents a good model system for
interrogating gene-drug interactions17-21 and has led to renewed understanding of
several important drugs19,21. Importantly, with regard to drug screen, these cells are
highly apoptosis-prone and readily undergo cell death at stress levels that cannot kill
most other types of cells (Fig. 1b). The ability of Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cells to amplify
drug-induced perturbance into a cell death response is essential for the proposed
screen (Fig. 1a), as it permits the extension of genome-wide screens onto many types
of nontoxic drugs, including seven COVID-19 drugs in this study.
Using a retroviral backbone, we introduced a genome-wide sgRNA library

22

into

cas9-expressing Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cells at 200-fold coverage. For the vast majority of
genes, there were 10 different sgRNAs per gene in the screen. Around 25 million of
sgRNA-expressing cells were subjected to two rounds of treatment with a COVID-19
drug. Drug doses were adjusted so that approximately 10% to 20% of cells were alive
at the lowest viability point (Extended Data Fig. 1). By examining which sgRNAs were
highly enriched or depleted in surviving cells, we identified genes that modify the
efficacy of these COVID-19 drugs.

Colchicine. Colchicine is an immunomodulatory agent used to suppress
inflammation in gout, and more recently shown to greatly reduce cardiovascular
events and death in chronic coronary disease23. Multiple studies showed colchicine
significantly lowered death rate in COVID-19 patients

1-3

. Mechanistically, colchicine

destabilizes microtubule and damages mitotic spindles, thereby ceasing the
proliferation of immune cells and alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. In our
genome-wide screen, we identified a number of genes whose sgRNAs were
significantly enriched after colchicine treatment (Fig. 2a). Showing the validity of this

screen system, ranked at No.10 was KIF2C (Fig. 2a’), a microtubule depolymerizing
protein previously known to regulate the toxicity of microtubule destabilizers24. The top
hit gene in our screen was TMEM161B, an uncharacterized protein localized primarily
at the plasma membrane. In addition, both FLCN and FNIP were identified as top hits
in our screen, suggesting the FLCN-FNIP protein complex may regulate
colchicine-induced cell death. Other top hits include RQCD1, PTBP1, KMT2D, AP1G1,
POU2F1 and BRD7 (Fig. 2a’), most of which have not been previously implicated for
microtubule drugs.
Prior to this study, we have completed genome-wide screens on taxol, vincristine
and vinorelbine, three anticancer drugs that also target microtubule. To understand
the performance of this screen system and whether certain genes are specific to
colchicine, we referenced the other three screen results (Fig. 2b). We found that
TMEM161B and POU2F1 affect cell viability in response to microtubule destabilizers
colchicine, vincristine and vinorelbine, but not to taxol, which is a microtubule
stabilizing drug. Other colchicine screen hit genes yielded similar phenotypes in all
four microtubule drug screens, suggesting they are common crucial determinants of
cell fate in response to microtubule disruption. Of note, these genes did not show up
in our screens of other types of anticancer drugs (Fig. 2b). This analysis showed that
for drugs of similar mechanisms of action, this screen system can consistently identify
the same group of genes, highlighting Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cell as a high performance
screen platform. Importantly, the genes identified in our screen for the first time
pointed to a group of potential biomarkers for colchicine’s use. If a COVID-19 patient
carries genetic deficiency on one of these genes, colchicine may not sufficiently
suppress the immune response to alleviate symptoms. This screen also shed light on
the cytotoxic mechanisms of microtubule poisons, an important group of anticancer
drugs whose death mechanisms are very unclear.

Dexamethasone.

Dexamethasone

is

a

glucocorticoid

that

lymphocyte proliferation. It is used to treat many types of autoimmune diseases and
hematological malignancies. Multiple studies demonstrated its efficacy in lowering

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.356279; this version posted October 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

death rate of COVID-19 patients4-6 . As a cell line of B lymphocyte lineage,
Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cell serves as an ideal platform for interrogating dexamethasone’s
immunosuppressive mechanism. In dexamethasone screen, sgRNAs targeting
transcription factor NR3C1, the glucocorticoid receptor for dexamethasone, were
dramatically enriched (Fig. 2c). Such a finding is consistent with previous knowledge
that dexamethasone binding of NR3C1 initiates a transcription program that is highly
detrimental to lymphocytes25. Our screen also recovered PTGES3, a NR3C1
chaperone protein required for glucocorticoid response26, and TSC22D3, which is an
immunosuppressive gene induced by glucocorticoids27 (Fig. 2c). These results
confirmed

that

the

NR3C1-centered

transcriptional

program

is

central

to

dexamethasone’s immune suppressive effect. Considering this, we further asked
whether certain cellular proteins with transcriptional inhibitory activities might
antagonize

such

a

transcription

program

and

protect

lymphocytes

from

dexamethasone-induced cell death. sgRNAs against such genes will be significantly
depleted after dexamethasone selection. We identified one gene that fits such
category. In the dexamethasone screen, inhibitor of DNA Binding 3 (ID3) was one of
the most severely depleted genes. ID3 is capable of inhibiting transcriptional activity
and is important for the B cell lineage. It is possible that ID3 may serve to limit the
dexamethasone-NR3C1 transcription response, thereby protecting B cells from
dexamethasone. Taken together, NR3C1, PTGES3, TSC22D3 and ID3 may represent
candidate genetic biomarkers for dexamethasone’s usage in various diseases
including COVID-19.

Ribavirin. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral
activities. A recent study showed that a triple-drug combination of ribavirin,
lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon β1, or the ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir combination
significantly accelerated viral clearance compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone7. This
suggests ribavirin may exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in patients.
To suppress virus replication, ribavirin needs to be gradually converted to NTP
analog to gain the ability to inhibit RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp).

Importantly, the same antiviral NTP analog will also interfere with vital cellular proteins
including eIF4E and IMPDH28 and become detrimental to mammalian cells.
Consequently, a cell death-based screen, enabled by Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cells (Fig. 1b), will
help identity enzymes that are important for the NTP conversion of ribavirin, which will
also shed light on the antiviral effects of ribavirin (Fig 1a). Indeed, the top hit in our
ribavirin screen was adenosine kinase (Adk) (Fig. 3a), an enzyme that catalyzes the
formation of ADP from adenosine. This is consistent with a previous report that ADK is
a key determinant for the anti-HCV activity of ribavirin29. As a proof of principle result,
such an observation shows the validity of our screen rationale. Our screen uncovered
two additional enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism (Fig. 3a). Adenylosuccinate
Synthase (ADSS) catalyzes the first step of the purine salvage pathway to form AMP.
NUDT2 is a phosphatase that hydrolyzes dinucleotides to generate ATP or GTP.
sgRNAs against these two genes were significantly enriched in cells that survived
ribavirin treatment. This suggests that similar to ADK, both ADSS and NUDT2 may be
critical to the NTP conversion and antiviral activity of ribavirin in cells. It may be
interesting to analyze the SNP, copy number and expression level of these genes in
responders and non-responders of ribavirin to explore potential biomarkers for
COVID-19 ribavirin therapy.

Remdesivir. Currently, remdesivir is the only antiviral drug approved by FDA for
COVID-19 treatment. Earlier in vitro studies and subsequent compassionate use of
remdesivir indicated its potential efficacy in treating COVID-1930-32. A randomized
clinical trial in patients with severe disease failed to show superior outcome of
remdesivir over control treatment8, whereas other studies suggested remdesivir could
speed up recovery in COVID-19 patients

9,10

. In the latter studies, remdesivir closely

missed the significance threshold in terms of reduction of death rate (7.1 % with
remdesivir vs 11.9% with placebo). It is therefore interesting to explore whether
certain genetic backgrounds render remdesivir ineffective and whether excluding such
genetic non-responders from the treatment group might help push it over the

significance threshold.
Once imported into cells, remdesivir is gradually degraded to AMP analog, which
is then converted to ATP analog to interfere with viral RdRp33-35. The same ATP
analog may also compete with endogenous ATP to inhibit other cellular proteins,
which may inflict damage. Importantly, such damage is enough to cause cell death in
Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cells (Fig. 1b), which allowed for a screen to discover genes crucial for
remdesivir importation and NTP conversion. The two top hits in our remdesivir screen
fell into such categories (Fig. 3b). We identified SLC29A3, a membrane transporter
that facilitates the cellular uptake of chemical compounds. Among the more than 350
SLC proteins in the genome, only SLC29A3 was significantly enriched in our screen,
suggesting its uniqueness for the importation of remdesivir. Our screen also identified
HINT1 (Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding Protein 1), which is an enzyme that breaks
down phosphoramidate bonds on purine nucleotides. Remdesivir was designed such
that once inside cells, it is converted to AMP analog in several steps33 (Fig. 3c).
Importantly, one of which involves breakage of such a phosphoramidate bond. Our
screen results suggested this step, catalyzed by a cellular enzyme HINT1, could be
rate-limiting in generating active remdesivir metabolites inside cells. Taken together,
our study indicated SLC29A3 and HINT1 could be two cellular proteins crucial for the
cellular concentration of remdesivir and its conversion into active metabolites, pointing
to the possibility that genetic and expression differences in these two genes may
affect COVID-19 patients’ response to remdesivir treatment.

Favipiravir. Favipiravir is an antiviral prodrug that partially resembles a purine
base. Favipiravir exhibited potent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 animal models36
and multiple clinical trials showed that favipiravir significantly shortened viral
clearance time and sped up clinical recovery11,37-39 . In our screen, the enriched
sgRNAs in cells that survived favipiravir treatment were mostly targeting cell death
genes (Fig. 3d). It is possible that multiple proteins may play redundant roles in the
importation and/or activation of favipiravir, therefore the enriched sgRNA sets could
not identify specific drug importers or metabolizing enzymes for favipiravir. However,

the sgRNAs depleted from cells that survived favipiravir treatment indicated drug
inactivation mechanisms, which are discussed below.

Drug export and inactivation mechanisms. In cells that survived drug selection,
we were also able to analyze which sgRNAs were strongly depleted after drug
selection. Such sgRNAs point to genes whose deficiency enhances drug efficacy
and/or toxicity. We first examined the ABC family of drug exporters

40

. Such proteins

pump chemicals out of cells, therefore their deficiency will increase cellular drug
concentration and result in higher levels of death. We examined in our COVID-19 drug
screens, sgRNAs against which ABC genes were the most prominently depleted (Fig.
4a and a’, Extended Data Table 1). The results suggested that ABCC1 is a candidate
exporter for remdesivir, and ABCC1, ABCB1 for colchicine.
As discussed before, the efficacy of antiviral drugs strongly depends on the
cellular concentration of their respective NTP analogs. For nucleoside analogs, the
first phosphorylation step to generate NMP analog is the rate-limiting step for
activation. Consequently, nucleotidases that break down NMP analog could
significantly reduce the antiviral efficacy of such drugs. Indeed, recent animal studies
showed that for remdesivir, significant amounts of the AMP analog were
dephosphorylated into inactive adenosine analog (depicted in Fig. 3c)

34,41

, which

could greatly reduce the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir. Since this type of
dephosphorylation

is

carried

out

by

5’-Nucleotidases42,

we

examined

all

5’-Nucleotidase genes in our screen (Extended Data Table 2) and found that NT5C3B
and NT5C2 are potentially responsible for such a dephosphorylation reaction for
remdesivir. A similar analysis also suggested that NT5C2 is responsible for the
dephosphorylation of NMP analog for favipiravir (Fig. 4b and b’).
Notably, in the treatment of leukemia, NT5C2 activity is the most frequent cause
of thiopurine treatment failure and disease relapse

43

. Through dephosphorylation of

GMP analog formed by thiopurine, this enzyme inactivates thiopurine. Based on our
screen results, we asked whether NT5C2 could similarly inactivate remdesivir and
favipiravir. Indeed, increased cellular NT5C2 activity significantly reduced cytotoxicity

of both remdesivir and favipiravir in multiple cell lines (Fig. 4c and 4d), but had little
effects on ribavirin. This suggested that analogous to the case of thiopurine, NT5C2
critically reduces the NMP analog of remdesivir and favipiravir, consequently reducing
the level of active antiviral NTP analogs. Therefore, NT5C2 may also represent a
crucial point for determining the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and favipiravir.

Validation

of

sgRNA screen

results.

Our

screens,

leveraging NTP

analog-induced cell death, discovered genes that affect the import, export and
metabolism of antiviral drugs used in COVID-19 treatment. Prompted by the
observation with NT5C2, we further validated top hits for three antiviral drugs in our
study (Fig. 5a). Consistent with the screen data, sgRNAs targeting SLC29A3 and
HINT1 significantly protected cells from remdesivir, whereas sgRNAs targeting
ABCC1, NT5C2 and NT5C3B caused sensitization. Similar validation results were
also seen for genes discovered in favipiravir and ribavirin screens, highlighting their
important roles in regulating the efficacy of these drugs.
Due to lack of timely access, we could not further confirm our finding with
Sars-CoV-2 models. As an alternative, we used Zika virus, whose replication44 could
be suppressed by remdesivir and ribavirin (Fig. 5b). We knocked out SLC29A3,
HINT1, ABCC1 and NT5C2 in Huh7 cells and found that deficiencies of these genes
indeed significantly affected remdesivir’s antiviral efficacy (Fig. 5c). For example,
HINT1 or SLC29A3 deficiency reduced remdesivir’s antiviral efficacy by 30 to 100
folds. This demonstrated the essential roles of SLC29A3 and HINT1 in the importation
and activation of remdesivir. Conversely, knockout of ABCC1 or NT5C2 caused
significant enhancement of remdesivir’s antiviral efficacy, confirming their importance
as the exporter and inactivator of remdesivir.

，

In the case of ribavirin, knockout of genes identified in this study, including ADK

ADSS and NUDT2 also decreased ribavirin’s antiviral efficacy (Fig. 5d). Taken
together, these results confirmed the virological relevance of our screen strategy and
provided the first set of potential genetic biomarkers for remdesivir.

Lastly, we also cloned sgRNAs to interrogate some of the top hits in colchicine
and dexamethasone screens. We confirmed that knockout of such genes indeed
conferred resistance or hypersensitivity to corresponding drugs (Fig. 5e), indicating
they may modulate the immunosuppressive effects of these drugs. For example,
TMEM161D, RQCD1, PTBP1, FLCN and FNIP knockout significantly protected cells
from colchicine-induced death. Our results for the first time linked these genes to
microtubule poisons. We also confirmed that ID3 knockout sensitized cells to
dexamethasone. Taken together, screens conducted in this study will help advance
the understanding of the action of COVID-19 drugs, potentially pointing to genetic
biomarkers for disease management.

Discussion
Dexamethasone, colchicine, remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin have been shown
to speed up SARS-coV-2 viral clearance or reduce COVID-19 death rate by various
studies. The role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 is more
controversial13-16,45-47, with larger studies of hospitalized patients arguing against their
use14-16. We also conducted CRISPR screens on chloroquine phosphate and
hydroxychloroquine and identified nearly identical lists of resistance genes (Extended
Data Fig. 2). Our results suggest that a group of genes involved in autophagy, as well
as lipid and cholesterol synthesis significantly modulate the action of chloroquine
drugs. Such a gene list may be useful for understanding chloroquine drugs’ clinical
use.
Due to the urgency of COVID-19 situation and lack of relevant knowledge,
COVID-19 drugs have been applied with little consideration of genetic biomarkers.
Given the rapid disease progression of COVID-19 and the presence of multiple
treatment options, it is urgent to discover genetic modulators for each COVID-19 drug,
such that patients may be matched to more effective drug choice. Here we present
the first report on genome-wide CRISPR screens on these COVID-19 drugs, with data
on both resistance and sensitization mechanisms.
For antiviral drugs, low toxicity and lack of executable screen endpoints
presented two significant hurdles for genome-wide screens. Our approach, using NTP
analog-induced cell death as a surrogate screen endpoint, overcame these obstacles
and helped uncover the transport and metabolism mechanisms crucial for the antiviral
efficacy of these drugs. From a method standpoint, this screen strategy is the first that
is capable of employing genome-wide libraries to identify genetic biomarkers for
antiviral drugs. Such a screen platform is broadly applicable for other types of
nucleoside analogs used to treat existed and emerging viral diseases. Extended Data
Figure 3 summarized our findings and showed the relative uniqueness of the drug
transporters and metabolizing enzymes discovered for these COVID-19 drugs.
The clinical efficacies of several COVID-19 drugs including remdesivir remain
under debate48. Incorporation of genetic biomarkers of drugs may lead to better

assessment of their efficacy, as demonstrated by previous clinical trials of PARP
inhibitors49. Importantly, for nucleoside-based anticancer drugs that are structurally
similar to antiviral drugs, numerous clinical studies have shown that SNPs and
expression status of their relevant transporters and metabolizing enzymes dictated
clinical outcome50-54. Therefore, the transportation, activating and detoxifying
mechanisms uncovered in this screen may point to clinical biomarkers of COVID-19
drugs. If such knowledge could be established in the future, it may help better
understand the efficacy of individual drugs in the context of COVID-19. For example, a
SNP on NT5C2, present in 15% of the population, significantly affected the cellular
activity of thiopurine and its incorporation into DNA55. Our results would similarly
suggest that patients with such genetic variation may respond differently to remdesivir
and favipiravir, but not to ribavirin (Fig. 4c and 4d). In addition, medically relevant
SNPs for many of the genes identified in our screen have been reported in human
population. For example, deleterious SNPs of SLC29A3, which we discovered as the
transporter for remdesivir, underly a diverse range of disease phenotypes including
short stature, osteoporosis, diabetes, hyperpigmentation, chronic inflammation and
hearing loss56-59 . Given our finding that SLC29A3 deficiency greatly reduced
remdesivir’s antiviral effects (Fig. 5c), such a genetic background may call for further
consideration on the use of remdesivir, yet the efficacy of favipiravir and ribavirin may
be less affected. From a precision medicine perspective, our findings may provide
rationales for pairing COVID-19 patients with proper drug choice, potentially
improving the overall cure rate. Such knowledge may also be useful for the
management of other diseases that utilize these drugs, such as influenza, Dengue
and Zika virus infections.
Lastly, rational design of drug combination is still lacking for COVID-19 treatment.
Our study may also shed light on such drug interaction. For example, given that
NT5C2 causes the inactivation of both remdesivir and favipiravir, combinatorial use of
both drugs may potentially saturate NT5C2 activity, which might lead to better antiviral
outcome for these drugs.
There are several limitations to our study. As a loss of function screen, our study

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.356279; this version posted October 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

cannot identify certain kinds of genes. For example, if several proteins function
redundantly in a drug-metabolizing step, our screen will not be able to uncover such
proteins either in the enriched or depleted sgRNA dataset. Genome-wide
overexpression screens may help complement this study. Moreover, there are many
discussions that drug efficacy in COVID-19 patients may be significantly influenced by
the timing of treatment. Our screen cannot address that question either. Due to the
urgency of the situation, we also did not have time to further delve into the
mechanisms of some of the screen hits. We present our screen results in the current

Figure 1. A genome-wide screen approach to identifying genes that modify the
efficacy of COIVD-19 drugs. a) A diagram depicting the rationale of the screen. For
example, antiviral drugs suppress viral replication by generating NTP analogs, which
inhibit viral RNA polymerase. Such NTP analogs also interfere with cellular process
that utilize normal NTPs, causing cellular stress that are sufficient to induce death in
Eμ-Myc;Arf-/- cells. By introducing genome-wide sgRNA library into such cells and
analyzing which gene knockout enabled survival after antiviral drug treatment, it is
possible to uncover genes that mediate the transport of these drugs, as well as genes

Materials and Methods:

Cell lines and drugs:
Eμ-Myc;Arf −/− cells were cultured in B-cell medium (45% DMEM, 45% IMDM and
10% FBS, supplemented with L-glutamate, and 5 μM β-mercaptoenthanol). Phoenix,
HeLa, MDA-MB-231, A549, 293T and Huh7 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamate and 10% (v/v) FBS. Remdesivir,
ribavirin, favipiravir, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine were provided by
or purchased from MedChemExpress. Colchicine was purchased from Targetmol.
Dexamethasone was purchased from Selleck.
Plasmids and generation of stable cell lines:
Murine or human NT5C2 cDNA and their activating mutant forms were
synthesized by Genescripts. Cas9 was cloned to a retroviral vector. About 1% of
Eμ-Myc;Arf

−/−

was infected by such Cas9-GFP retrovirus, from which we established

a Cas9-expressing Eμ-Myc;Arf

−/−

stable cell line. Sequences of sgRNAs used in

validation experiments are listed in Extended Data Table 3.
Transfer of sgRNA libraries to a retroviral backbone:
Eμ-Myc;Arf −/− cells cannot be efficiently infected with lentivirus. Therefore, we
bulk transferred sgRNA sequences from the lentiviral library (Addgene: #1000000096)
into a pBabe-SV40-puro backbone. Such a backbone can efficiently express sgRNAs
and cause gene editing in Cas9-expressing Eμ-Myc;Arf

−/−

cells. Next-generation

sequencing confirmed the quality of the subclone library, with around 98% of sgRNAs
still present.
First, the U6-sgRNA segment from LentiGuide-Puro(Addgene #52963) was PCR
amplified

and

transferred

to

pBabe-SV40-puro

to

a

pBabe-U6sgRNA-SV40-puro vector with NheI and XhoI cloning sites.
Next, a mouse KO sgRNA pooled library (Addgene: #1000000096, 10sgRNA per
gene) was amplified at 1000X fold coverage, and the sgRNAs were digested with
NheI/XhoI from the library. The insert was gel purified twice and concentrated using

pBabe-U6sgRNA-SV40-puro vector was digested with NheI/XhoI. After ligating the
vector and sgRNA inserts, 20 tubes of 5-alpha Electrocompetent E. coli
(Takara,#9027) were transformed using electroporation and the subcloned library was
obtained by combining 4 maxipreps. The library complexity was confirmed by
streaking diluted bacteria onto plates and counting colonies. The total number of
colonies was > 100x the size of the library.
To generate a mCherry-expressing sgRNA vector used in Fig.5a, the plasmid
pBabe-U6sgRNA-SV40-puro was digested to remove puro fragment and the mCherry
fragment was cloned into the plasmid to create pBabe-U6sgRNA-SV40-mCherry.
Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB #M0531L) was used for all
cloning PCR reactions.
Generation of sgRNA-expressing retrovirus and drug screen:
Retrovirus packaging was achieved in phoenix cells using standard protocols.
Around 100 million of phoenix cells were transfected with retroviral sgRNA library
(10sgRNA per gene). Virus-containing medium was collected from these cells 2 days
after transfection, and added to 230 million of Eμ-Myc;Arf

−/−

cells for infection.

Infected cells gained puromycin resistance from the retroviral backbone, which
enabled us to determine that around 23 million of Eμ-Myc;Arf −/− cells were infected. At
such an infection rate, most cells should only contain one sgRNA. 23 million of
infected cells also roughly correlate to 100X coverage of the sgRNA library.
After expansion of these infected cells, they were divided and 25 million of such
cells were each subjected to treatment with a drug. Around 48hrs after treatment, cell
viability dropped to 10~20%. Cells were centrifugated and resuspended in normal
culture medium to allow for recovery. 3~5 days after this, cells reached viability
between 60% to 70%. They were again treated with drugs and similar protocols was
followed to remove drugs after this second round of treatment. After recovery from the
second round of drug selection, 25 million of alive cells were collected. 25 million of
no-treatment cells were also collected as a control.

Genomic DNA of the collected cells was extracted with Magen HiPure Tissue
DNA Midi Kits (D3122-03), and sgRNA sequences were PCR amplified using the Q5®
Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X master Mix. From each sample, 40μg of genomic DNA was
used for PCR reaction. 8 tubes of 50μl PCR reaction was set up for each sample.
PCR was stopped at 23 cycles. Water control was used to ensure there was no
aerosol contamination.
The 400μl PCR products were purified with thermo scientific GeneJET Gel
Extraction Kit (K0692) and dissolved in 30μl dH2O. Such products were separated
with 2.5% agarose gel to obtain the 250bp PCR products. After purification with
thermo scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (K0692), the composition of sgRNAs
was analyzed by NGS at Novagene (Beijing). After NGS, Analysis of raw sequencing
reads was performed using MAGeCKFlute analysi60. Fig. 2a and similar figures were
generated from MAGeCKFlute analysis.
To generate the data for the type of analysis in 2A’, we performed the following
analysis. If a gene knockout induced by sgRNA1.1 protected cells from a drug, this
sgRNA1.1 will be enriched in the drug-selected population. Before drug selection,

‰ of all sgRNAs from non-treated samples. After drug
selection, that percentage increased to 1‰. From such data, we can conclude that

sgRNA1.1 made up 0.0025

sgRNA1.1 was enriched by 400 fold after drug selection. Similar method was used if a
sgRNA was relatively depleted after drug selection.

GFP or mCherry-based survival competition assay to assess relative resistance
index conferred by cDNA expression or sgRNA knockout. Such experiments
were used to produce data for Fig.4C’ and Fig.5A and 5E. The overall experimental
design was previously described in Jiang et al17. Briefly, NT5C2 cDNA or its activating
mutant along with GFP was stably expressed in a small portion of Eμ-Myc;Arf −/− cells.
Remdesivir was applied to such cells at concentration that would kill 80~90% of
uninfected parental cells. Since NT5C2 inactivates remdesivir and protected cells
from remdesivir-induced cell death, after drug treatment, most of the surviving cells

will be GFP positive that express NT5C2. If the GFP percentage rose from 20% in
untreated cells to 80% in remdesivir-treated cells, it can be calculated that the relative
resistance index is (0.8-0.8*0.2)/(0.2-0.8*0.2)=16, meaning that at such drug
concentration, NT5C2-expressing cells are 16 fold as likely to survive remdesivir
compared with control cells. The rationale behind such calculation and the biological
meaning of relative resistance index is detailed in Jiang et al 17.
Certain events, such as ABCC1 knockout sensitizes cells to the killing by
remdesivir. Therefore, sgABCC1 expressing, mCherry positive cells will die more after
remdesivir treatment. In such scenario, we may observe that the mCherry positive
rate drops from 50% in untreated cells to 20% in remdesivir-selected samples. From
such numbers, it can be calculated that the relative resistance index is
(0.2-0.2*0.5)/(0.5-0.5*0.2)=0.25, meaning ABCC1 knockout cells are 4 fold as likely
to die from remdesivir-induced killing. Accordingly, we will designate a relative
sensitization index of -4 to sgABCC1.

Virus production. Zika virus stock was prepared as previously described44. Briefly, in
vitro transcribed viral RNA was electroporated into Vero E6 cells, 72h-120h
supernatants was harvested and titrated by plaque forming assay after removal of
dead cells and cell debris.
Infection of Huh7 derived cell line. Cells were seeded in 48-well plates for 24 hours
before incubation with Zika virus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) equal to 1. 4 hours
later, the unbound viruses were replaced by fresh medium containing remdesivir or
ribavirin. After 24 hours, cells were collected and lysed by TRIZOL(Tiangen) to extract
RNA. Such RNA samples were subjected to reverse transcription (Toyobo) and ZIKV
genome copies were analyzed by quantitative PCR(Toyobo) with primers targeting
ZIKV NS3. The sequences for the qPCR primers are GTTTGGCTGGCCTATCAGGT
(forward) and GTGTCTGGTCCACACCTCTG (reverse).
