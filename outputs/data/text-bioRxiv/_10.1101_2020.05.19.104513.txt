Abstract
A crucial factor in mitigating respiratory viral outbreaks is early determination of the duration of the
incubation period and, accordingly, the required quarantine time for potentially exposed individuals.
Here, we explore different genomic features of RNA viruses that correlate with the incubation times and
provide a predictive model that accurately estimates the upper limit incubation time for diverse viruses
including SARS-CoV-2, and thus, could help control future outbreaks.

Main Text
The recent outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the resulting COVID-19 disease has led to
an unprecedented worldwide emergency1. Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations,
numerous countries have taken severe preventive measures to combat and stem the spread of the
virus. A key effective measure recommended by the WHO in viral outbreaks is enforcing a period of
quarantine on individuals that are suspected to have come in contact with the causative agent until they
are proven clean of infection2,3. The length of the quarantine typically depends on the time from virus
exposure to the emergence of symptoms, i.e. the incubation period. The duration of the incubation
period is specific to the causative virus4. Underestimation of the incubation time could lead to infected
individuals being prematurely released from quarantine and spreading the disease, whereas
overestimation can have a debilitating economic impact and cause detrimental psychological effects5.
Therefore, knowledge of the upper limit of a virus incubation period is crucial to effectively combat and
prevent outbreaks while minimizing the negative consequences of the quarantine.
The length of the incubation period varies both across and within virus families4. To our knowledge,
genomic features (if any) that correlate with the incubation time are currently unknown. There is
therefore a vital need for methods to predict the incubation periods of emerging viruses. Such methods
can be deployed in future viral outbreaks for early, accurate inference of the incubation period and
immediate implementation of optimized quarantining interventions that will mitigate the spread of the
virus while minimizing the negative societal impact6.
Here, we analyzed different genomic characteristics of respiratory, non-segmented, single-strand RNA
(ssRNA) viruses and identified features that are predictive of the incubation time, and are generalizable
across virus families. Based on these features, we developed an elastic net regression model that
predicts virus incubation periods. We extensively validated the robustness of this model and the
selected features for the prediction of the incubation period across diverse viruses and virus families, to
enable accurate early estimation of the incubation period for future outbreaks.
We focused on non-segmented ssRNA viruses that cause respiratory infections, to minimize
confounders to the incubation period that could result from different genome structures and/or
different infected tissues and cell types. In total, we collected information for 14 viruses from 4 families.
Given that the quarantine time is defined as the upper limit of virus incubation time, we extracted the
upper estimates of the incubation periods for all viruses in the analyzed set (Supp. Table 1, see Methods
for details). We then curated 8 features that we hypothesized could be relevant for the incubation
period (Figure 1a), based on the complete genome nucleotide sequences and within-population genome
alignments of all sequenced strains of each virus (Supp. Datasets 1 and 2, see Methods for details).
Analysis of the pairwise associations between these features (Fig. 1a) confirmed some previously
reported associations, such as the negative correlation between genome length and mutation rate7 and
the positive correlation between GC content and codon adaptation index8 (CAI) (Fig. 1b). Strikingly, our
findings suggest that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is substantially lower than that of other human
coronaviruses (CoV), including its closest human-infecting relative, SARS-CoV (with an average of 1.4e-3

virus families. The features shown in the upper panels are family-generic, and those in the bottom
panels are family-specific.
We then sought to select features to be used for a predictive model of the incubation time. To avoid
confounding the model with features that are primarily driven by virus family, we formally quantified
whether a given feature is significantly associated with the family identity. To this end, we applied two
complementary approaches, namely, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an empirical, non-parametric
test, to estimate, for each feature, whether it varies more across virus families than within each family
(see Methods for details). The results obtained with the two approaches were equivalent,
demonstrating that half of the considered features vary more between families than within families, and
therefore may confound the model (Fig. 1c). We denote such features family-specific. By contrast, we
found that the incubation time was not significantly associated with virus family (Fig. 1d), supporting
selection of features that are not family-specific to train a model; we denote such features familygeneric. Four other features were found to be family-generic: GC content of the virus genome; variance
of the number of different nucleotides observed per position in the alignment of the virus strains;
number of protein-coding genes in the virus genome; codon adaptation index (CAI) (Fig. 1e). Thus, these
four features were included in the model.
Next, we sought to divide the analyzed dataset into training and test sets. To maintain a large enough
independent test set, we trained an elastic net model on the 7 human-infecting viruses of the family
Coronaviridae (Fig. 2a), using the four family-generic features. We found that this model, which was
trained on a single viral family, generalized well to viruses from the three other families (Fig. 2b). The
test mean absolute error was 1.63 days (Fig. 2b), attesting to a close estimation of the upper limit of the
incubation time in an independent data set. Moreover, the model predictions strongly correlated with
the ranks of the assigned incubation periods in the test set (Spearman’s ρ = 0.91, p-value = 0.005).
Specifically, for the virus with the longest known incubation period, measles, the longest incubation
time, 9.7 days, was predicted. Although measles was assigned an upper limit incubation period of 14
days in our data, the majority of the available reports are indeed in the range of 9-12 days10. The second
longest incubation period was also correctly assigned, to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with a
prediction of 9.1 days, compared to an assigned period of 8 days in our data. For parainfluenza 1-3, the
model predicted 7.3, 4.9, and 6.2 days, respectively, closely approximating the assigned 6 days.
Metapneumovirus was similarly accurately predicted to have a 6.5 days incubation period, within half a
day of its assigned 6 days. Finally, the shortest incubation time predicted was correctly assigned to
rhinovirus, with a prediction of a 1.2 day incubation period. Although rhinovirus was assigned a 4 day
incubation period in our data, most of the cases show symptoms within one day 11.
Exploration of the model indicated that the strongest predictive features were the number of proteincoding genes and GC content, with higher values in either feature corresponding to a longer incubation
time (Fig. 2c). Elucidation of the mechanisms behind these associations will require extensive
experimental work. A straightforward, even if, likely, over-simplified explanation could be that the larger
number of genes to be translated by the virus lengthens its replication cycle, under the assumption that
the number of translation initiation events and/or subgenomic RNAs that need to be transcribed are

rate-limiting factors in virus reproduction. Similarly, a higher GC content leads to the formation of
stable secondary structures in the virus RNA, with higher kinetic barriers that the ribosome then needs
to disrupt during translation, resulting in longer translation times12. Thus, one possible explanation for
the association between the number of protein-coding genes and the GC content and longer incubation
periods is that the longer cumulative translation time extends the replication cycle and consequently,
the incubation period. Alternatively or additionally, extra genes could contribute to more complex
interactions of the virus with the host organism, resulting in a longer incubation times. In particular, the
highly virulent coronaviruses with long characteristic incubation periods are known to encode
additional, accessory proteins compared to low virulence viruses that have shorter incubation times13,14.
The accessory genes are dispensable for virus reproduction in cell culture and have been implicated in
virus-host interactions15. Recent preliminary analysis has shown that some of these additional genes
encode proteins containing distinct immunoglobulin-like domains, which is compatible with roles in
interactions with the immune system of the host16.
To assess the robustness of the selected features, we tested models trained with different partitioning
of the data into train and test sets. We found that these changes did not significantly change the
performance of the models, further attesting to the robustness of the signal obtained using the four
family-generic features (Fig. 2d). By contrast, a model trained with family-specific features does not
generalize to the test set, and one trained using a mixture of family-generic and family-specific features
disregards the latter by nullifying their coefficients (Supp. Fig. 1), further demonstrating the efficacy of
relying on family-generic features only. The coefficients assigned to the family-generic features did not
vary substantially across different training sets, confirming that the method is not particularly sensitive
to the data used for training (Fig. 2c). Nevertheless, the high performance of the model that is trained
exclusively on CoV seems to suggest that this virus family provides a good representation of the
incubation period, and/or that training on a single family is preferable given the small dataset and the
possibility of confounding effects.

To evaluate the utility of our model, we examined how this method could have performed during the
early stages of the current COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we removed SARS-CoV-2 from the training
data and trained the model on the remaining 6 CoV only, with the caveat that this training set is poorly
balanced as it contains only 2 viruses with incubation times longer than 3 days, and therefore, might
underestimate when predicting viruses with long incubation times. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2
is still being determined, with the recommended quarantine time conservatively set at 14 days although

recent reports indicate that 97.5% of patients who will develop symptoms do so within a 95%
confidence interval of 8.2-15.6 days17. Despite having been trained on an imbalanced training set, the
model predicts an incubation period of 8.8 days for SARS-CoV-2, correctly placing SARS-CoV-2 in the
upper range of incubation periods, well within the confidence interval, and predicting an incubation
period duration during which the vast majority of symptomatic patients will have shown symptoms17.
Clearly, this estimate could have been useful in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 2e; similar
analysis for the other CoV is provided in Supp. Fig. 2).
In summary, we examined here genomic features that could be predictive of the virus incubation times
of human pathogenic ssRNA viruses, some of which are major causative agents of respiratory
pandemics18. We identified four family-generic genomic features that consistently predict the incubation
periods with high accuracy. Using these features, we developed a robust model that is predictive of
incubation times and can directly facilitate early and accurate estimation of the required quarantine
time for future pandemics.
Methods
Sequence Datasets
Reference genome sequences and GenBank files were downloaded from the NCBI19 for each virus (Supp.
Table 1, Supp. File 1). For each virus, additional strains were downloaded from the NCBI and aligned
using Mafft20 v7.407 with default parameters, resulting in an alignment file for each of the 14 viruses
(Supp. File 2). Phylogenetic trees were generated for each virus based on the alignment using
FastTree21,22 with the “-nt” parameter.
Incubation period assignment
The incubation time for each of the 14 viruses was collected from literature (Supp. Table 1). As
incubation periods vary, where possible, the upper limit was used, and a consensus of reports was
followed. We note that there are small variations in reports of the incubation times, and the assigned
values represent the best approximation as explained below. Changing the assigned incubation times
within the range of reports maintains a similarly high performance of the trained model (Supp. Fig. 2).
The rationale for the selected incubation times was as follows:
a. 229E-CoV, HKU1-CoV, NL63-CoV and OC43-CoV. For these coronaviruses, which are causative
agents of common colds, a 3 day incubation period was assigned, following the majority of
reports23,24.
b. MERS-CoV. A 14 day incubation period was assigned to MERS-CoV, per previous reports25.
c. SARS-CoV. The estimates show 13 days as an upper limit in the majority of reports4,26.
d. SARS-CoV-2. Although more data is needed to assess the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, we
set the duration to 14 days given the recommended quarantine times2.
e. Measles virus. There is a considerable range of reported incubation periods, with the majority of
reports indicating 9-12 days and some reports going several days beyond that. Thus, we set the
incubation period to 14 days10.

f.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). For RSV, the incubation period was set to 8 days, in accordance
with the higher range of the majority of reports27.
g. Parainfluenza. The parainfluenza incubation period was consistently reported to be between 2-6
days, and therefore was assigned the upper limit of 6 days4.
h. Rhinovirus. Per previous reports, a 4 day incubation period was assigned to Rhinovirus4.
i. Metapneumovirus. 6 days was assigned to human metapneumovirus, given the commonly
reported range of 4-6 days28.
Features
Genomic features were calculated as follows:
a. Genome length. The number of nucleotides in the reference genome sequence.
b. Number of genes. The number of genes in the reference genome’s associated GenBank file. We
verified for each virus that there were no undetected genes within its genome using
MetaGeneMark29 gene prediction software.
c. Positive or negative strand RNA. Whether the RNA virus is positive strand or negative strand.
This was set to 1 if the virus has a positive strand genome, and to 0 if it has a negative strand
genome.
d. Codon adaptation index (CAI). The CAI was used to analyze the codon usage bias of each virus in
comparison to human. The CAI was calculated by concatenating all the coding sequences (CDS)
in each virus reference genome GenBank file and using the Biopython30,31 software package
implementation with a reference human codon usage table32.
e. GC content. This was calculated for each reference genome using Biopython30.
f. Mutation rate. Raw mutation rates were estimated per each virus genome alignment, without
accounting for selection bias, by detecting the ancestral base for every base in the genome for
every non-leaf node in the tree using maximum parsimony. Then, at each branch point, the
transitions between both sides of the branch were counted, and the average count was then
divided by the length of the genome for the final estimate.
g. Average and variance of the changes in each position of the alignment. The change in alignment
position is defined as the number of different values observed in each position of the virus
alignment, divided by the number of strains in the alignment. The average and variance of these
values are used as features.
Evaluation of the specificity of the features for virus families
We sought to evaluate, for each feature, whether it is associated with the identity of the virus family
which would be a potential confounder to the model. We hence searched for features whose variance
within each virus family was not significantly smaller than its overall variance. To this end, each feature
was evaluated using two methods.
The first method is a one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA). One-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis
that the means of the measurement variable are the same for the different categories of data, against
the alternative hypothesis that they are not all the same. Hence, lower assigned p-values signify that the
null hypothesis is rejected, and that different viral families have different population means with respect
to each feature. We therefore consider features assigned with a P-value greater than 0.05, for which we

could accept the null hypothesis, and could not conclude that the feature mean was associated with the
viral family. The ANOVA test was implemented in Python using the f_oneway function in the SciPy33
package.

𝛽̂ = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝛽 (𝐿(𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝛽)) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝛽 (||𝑦 − 𝑋𝛽||2 + +𝜆1 ||𝛽||1 + 𝜆2 ||𝛽||2 )

The ANOVA test assumes that the samples are independent, taken from normally distributed
populations with equal standard deviations between the groups. These assumptions, that must be
satisfied for the associated p-value to be valid, are not guaranteed and are difficult to evaluate. We
hence implemented a second, empirical test, which is not parametric and does not rely on any
assumptions. This empirical test evaluates, for a given feature, if its variance within virus families is
smaller than would be observed by random assignment of families to viruses. We reason that a feature
which is associated with the virus family would have significantly smaller variance within the true family
assignment than within a random family assignment. The null hypothesis is that the variance of the
features within each family is similar to the variance across families, and the alternative hypothesis is
that the variance of the features within each family is smaller than the variance across families. To
perform the empirical test, the feature variance within each virus family is calculated and averaged.
Next, the feature values are randomly permuted 1,000 times and the same calculation is performed, to
generate a null distribution. Let the number of times the variance of the permuted values is less than
the variance of the real values be 𝑋. The p-value is calculated as (𝑋 + 1)/(1000 + 1). Thus, a lower pvalue indicates that the feature’s within-family variance is smaller than our null expectation. We search
for features with a p-value greater than 0.05, for which we conclude that the variance within the actual
families is not smaller than that within randomly assigned families. This evaluation does not necessarily
indicate that the family-specific features are poor predictors, rather, that, with the data available, it
would not be possible to discern whether the signal from these features is primarily driven by the
variation between virus families.
Elastic Net Model
The elastic net method34 is a generalization of LASSO using Ridge regression shrinkage, where the naïve
estimator 𝛽̂ is a minimizer of the criterion 𝐿(𝜆1 , 𝜆2 , 𝛽) by:

for any fixed, non-negative 𝜆1 , 𝜆2 . Elastic net was chosen because it has characteristics of both LASSO
and Ridge regression, which are controlled by the penalties coefficients, thus outperforming other
regularization and variable selection approaches34.
The elastic net model was constructed in Python using the scikit-learn35 ElasticNet function with default
parameters. The features were standardized before training, with the same standardization parameters
used in training applied to test data before prediction.
