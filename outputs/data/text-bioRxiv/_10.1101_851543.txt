Abstract

2

The type I interferon (IFN) response is an important component of the innate immune response to

3

viral infection. Precise control of interferon responses is critical; insufficient levels of interferon-

4

stimulated genes (ISGs) can lead to a failure to restrict viral spread while excessive ISG activation

5

can result in interferon-related pathologies. While both positive and negative regulatory factors

6

control the magnitude and duration of IFN signaling, it is also appreciated that a number of ISGs

7

regulate aspects of the interferon response themselves. However, the mechanisms underlying these

8

ISG regulatory networks remain incompletely defined. In this study, we performed a CRISPR

9

activation screen to identify new regulators of the type I IFN response. We identified ETS variant

10

transcription factor 7 (ETV7), a strongly induced ISG, as a protein that acts as a negative regulator

11

of the type I IFN response; however, ETV7 did not uniformly suppress ISG transcription. Instead,

12

ETV7 preferentially targeted a subset of known antiviral ISGs. Further, we showed the subset of

13

ETV7-modulated ISGs was particularly important for IFN-mediated control of some viruses

14

including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data assign a function for ETV7 as

15

an IFN response regulator and also identify ETV7 as a therapeutic target to increase innate

16

responses and potentiate the efficacy of interferon-based antiviral therapies.

Introduction

19

The type I interferon (IFN) response is a transient innate immune defense system that, upon

20

activation by viral infection or therapeutic IFN treatment, induces the transcription of hundreds of

21

interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1). Many ISGs have characterized antiviral roles that restrict

22

viral replication by either interfering with viral processes directly or altering cellular pathways

23

required for viral replication (2). However, because replication mechanisms and points of

24

interaction with the cell differ between viruses, individual ISGs have varying potencies against

25

different viruses (3–5). As a result, unique combinations of ISGs are thought to mediate successful

26

antiviral responses against distinct viruses (1, 6).

27
28

The canonical activation pathway of the type I IFN signaling pathway induced by viral infection,

29

or after therapeutic administration (7), is well understood (8, 9). Extracellular IFN is bound by its

30

cognate plasma membrane-localized receptor (IFNAR1/2). Downstream effectors (JAK proteins)

31

are phosphorylated to then activate formation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)

32

complex. Finally, the ISGF3 complex of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 translocates to the nucleus (8)

33

and binds the interferon sensitive response element (ISRE), with the consensus DNA motif

34

GAAANNGAAA, to activate transcription of ISGs (10).

35
36

As infection is cleared and virally-derived innate immune activators become scarce, interferon

37

production is reduced and the interferon-stimulated gene response is downregulated. To facilitate

38

this return to cell homeostasis, IFN induced negative regulators, such as SOCS1 (11) and USP18

39

(12), act at multiple levels in the signaling pathway (13). Thus, negative regulators of IFN

40

responses are an important group of IFN-stimulated genes that control the duration of ISG

41

induction and activity. Antagonism of interferon response negative regulators has been proposed

42

as a mechanism to enhance host antiviral responses to clear infection, both alone and in conjunction

43

with IFN treatment (14–16), and most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic (17). However,

44

regulators working upstream of transcription impact ISGs indiscriminately, including suppression

45

of the pro-inflammatory effectors, that when overabundant, can induce a cytokine storm; for

46

example, agonists of an IFNAR-downregulating protein, S1PR1 (18), are proposed for use against

47

pandemic influenza viruses (19) and SARS-CoV-2 (20) to instead limit excessive immune

48

responses associated with interferon signaling. An ideal negative regulator of the IFN response for

49

antiviral therapeutic targeting would enhance virus restricting ISGs specifically, without affecting

50

pro-immune cytokines.

51
52

In addition to the upstream regulators that broadly activate or suppress IFN responses, there are

53

interferon-induced transcriptional regulators that enhance, limit, or fine-tune ISG activity (21).

54

Many ISGs themselves participate in innate immune signaling to amplify IFN and other pro-

55

immune responses (22). Activators also add complexity by inducing non-canonical IFN response

56

pathways or specific groups of ISGs. Interferon responsive factors (IRFs) 1 and 7 are ISGs and

57

transcription factors that activate subsets of ISGs (23, 24). Further, recent work has shown that

58

ELF1 (E74-like ETS transcription factor) is induced by IFN and facilitates the expression of a

59

group of genes not otherwise activated by the IFN response (25). Additional regulatory steps for

60

ISGs, post-JAK/STAT signaling, likely exist to allow the cell to fine-tune its antiviral activity for

61

an effective and appropriate response. While interferon-induced positive regulators of the IFN

62

response are known to shape the complexity of ISG activation, reports of analogous roles for

63

negative regulators remain conspicuously absent.

64
65

To address this gap in knowledge and identify genes able to shape the IFN response through

66

negative regulation, we performed a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screen that selected for factors

67

sufficient to prevent expression of an ISRE-containing IFN response reporter. We identified ETV7

68

(ETS variant transcription factor 7) as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response with a role

69

in controlling the expression of specific ISGs. We further showed the ETV7-modulated ISGs are

70

important for control of some IFN-sensitive respiratory viruses. Together, these data demonstrate

71

ETV7 is a suppressive component of the complex ISG regulatory network that could be targeted

72

to enhance specific antiviral responses against influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (1, 26).

Results

75

A CRISPR activation screen identifies ETV7 as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response.

76

In order to identify negative regulators of the type I IFN response, we developed a type I IFN

77

response reporter that included seven copies of the consensus interferon sensitive response element

78

(ISRE) ahead of a minimal CMV promoter controlling expression of sfGFP (Fig. 1A). To make

79

our reporter temporally specific, sfGFP was fused to a mouse ornithine decarboxylase (MODC)

80

protein degradation domain to decrease its half-life (27). We stably introduced this construct into

81

the A549 lung epithelial cell line along with a dCAS9-VP64 fusion protein and a MS2-p65-HSF1

82

activator complex required for the SAM CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system (28). After clonal

83

selection, 99.8% of the A549-SAM-IFN response cells expressed GFP in response to type I IFN

84

treatment (Fig. 1B and C).

85
86

To perform the screen, we took the A549-SAM-IFN response cell line and introduced a lentivirus

87

library containing sgRNAs designed to activate every putative ORF in the human genome (28)

88

(Fig. 1D). After 48 hours, half of the cells were collected to determine the transduction efficiency

89

and the remaining cells were re-plated for IFN stimulation. At 72 hours post-sgRNA introduction,

90

the cells were treated with IFN-a and collected for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

91

During sorting, we eliminated reporter-positive cells and collected only cells that were

92

nonresponsive to IFN as this population should theoretically be overexpressing a negative

regulator of the IFN response. We performed two independent biological replicates of the screen

95

and sequenced the sgRNA-containing amplicons derived from our input DNA, unselected

96

transduced cells, and cells that were nonresponsive to type I IFN. Raw sequencing data was

97

aligned, mapped, and subsequently analyzed using the MAGeCK pipeline (29) to generate z-score

98

values for each gene. Genes were defined as “hits” if their z-scores exceeded two standard

99

deviations from the mean, resulting in an overlap of 10 high-confidence genes between the two

100

screen replicates (Fig. S1A, Table S1, Data files S1 and S2). We were seeking to identify

101

regulators of the IFN response that are regulated by IFN themselves; therefore, we selected hits

102

for validation previously reported to have at least a two-fold induction after IFN stimulation in the

103

Interferome database (30). This analysis identified three hits (C1GALT1, ETV7, and NUP153) as

104

potential negative regulators of the type I IFN response (Table S1).

105
106

To validate our three hits, and to eliminate any potential off-target effects of CRISPRa, we cloned

107

the three ORFs and validated overexpression of the genes in 293T cells (Fig. S1B). Co-transfection

108

of the overexpression plasmids and IFN response plasmid, followed by stimulation with IFN-a,

109

resulted in lower reporter expression compared to a control mCherry-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1E

110

and F, Fig. S1C). To verify this repressive activity was specific to the IFN response and the hits

111

were not general inhibitors of transcription or translation, we transfected the overexpression

112

plasmids along with a constitutively active GFP-expressing plasmid. We included a positive

113

control (EIF2AK1/HRI), which is known to suppress host translation when overexpressed (31).

114

None of the potential hits significantly reduced expression of the GFP-expressing plasmid (Fig.

115

1G, Fig. S1D). We therefore chose ETV7 for further characterization because: 1) NUP153 has

116

previously been shown to control the distribution of STAT1 in the cell (32), 2) ETV7 had not been

117

reported to play a role in the IFN response, and 3) it had the strongest inhibitory phenotype against

118

the IFN response reporter.

119
120

After confirming overexpression of ETV7 at the protein level (Fig. 1H), we verified that the

121

inhibitory effects of ETV7 were not restricted to the IFN response reporter plasmid. We collected

122

mRNA and protein from IFN-a stimulated ETV7 overexpression cells to quantify effects on the

123

expression of endogenous ISGs. ETV7 overexpression significantly repressed the induction of

124

three prototypical ISGs (IFIT1, MX1, and ISG15) at the RNA level (Fig. 1I). The reduction of

125

ISG expression during ETV7 overexpression was also demonstrated at the protein level for IFIT1

126

(Fig. 1J). These data together demonstrate that overexpression of ETV7 alone is sufficient to

127

repress ISG induction by type I IFN.

128
129

ETV7 acts as a transcription factor to repress IFN-induced expression.

130

ETV7 is known to be a repressive transcription factor (33, 34), although a role in repressing type

131

I IFN responses has never been reported. To determine whether ETV7 acts as a transcription factor

132

in this context, we generated a previously validated mutant of ETV7, called ETV7(KALK), which

133

is unable to bind DNA (Fig. 2A and B) (35). Overexpression of ETV7(KALK) and stimulation

135

with IFN-a had no measurable effect on expression of the IFN response reporter, in contrast to

136

WT ETV7 overexpression (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2A).

137
138

ETV7 has been reported to bind the canonical ETS family DNA motif, GGAA (36), known as an

139

“ETS” site (Fig. 2D). The original IFN response reporter design contained multiple ETS sites (Fig.

140

2E), which likely explains why it is negatively impacted by ETV7 in our screen. To test the

141

requirement of ETS sites for ETV7 repressive activity against our reporter, we generated an IFN

142

response reporter containing seven consensus ISREs from canonical ISGs that all lack ETS sites

143

(ISRE -ETS) (Fig. 2E). We transfected the two reporter plasmids (ISRE +ETS and ISRE -ETS)

144

independently into 293T cells and stimulated with IFN-a. As expected, both reporter plasmids

145

responded to IFN treatment and were repressed by overexpression of known negative regulators

146

of the type I IFN response (SOCS1, USP18) that function upstream of transcription (Fig. S2B).

147

When ETV7 was transfected into cells with the IFN response reporters and stimulated with IFN

148

however, the repressive activity of ETV7 was restricted to the reporter plasmid containing ETS

149

motifs (Fig. 2F, Fig. S2C).

151

To provide evidence of ETV7 directly binding ISRE motifs containing ETS sites, we performed a

152

DNA oligo-based pull-down experiment using the ISG15 ISRE sequence (Fig. 2G). We chose this

153

ISRE because 1) it contains an ETS binding site, 2) it was included in our initial IFN response

154

reporter, and 3) ETV7 was shown to impact ISG15 induction (Fig. 1I). In addition to the wild-

155

type ISG15 ISRE biotinylated oligos, we tested biotinylated oligos with a single nucleotide

156

mutation that eliminates the ETS site in the ISG15 ISRE (-ETS). We generated nuclear lysates

157

from 293T cells overexpressing ETV7 and treated with IFN-a, incubated the lysate with either the

158

biotinylated WT or -ETS ISG15 ISRE oligos, and pulled down the biotinylated DNA using

159

streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Western blotting for ETV7 protein revealed the transcription

160

factor bound the WT ISG15 ISRE containing the ETS site, but not the mutated version of the

161

promoter lacking the ETS site (Fig. 2H). Together, these experiments demonstrate that the

162

repressive activity of ETV7 requires both its ability to bind DNA and the presence of ETS sites in

163

the target ISG promoters.

164
165

ETV7 non-uniformly represses IFN-stimulated gene expression

166

Since consensus ISREs can either contain or lack a GGAA motif (Table S2), we hypothesized

167

ETV7 could differentially act on specific ISGs based on the presence or absence of ETS sites in

168

their ISRE sequences and promoters. To perform an unbiased examination of the effect of ETV7

169

upregulation, we performed RNA sequencing in cells with or without ETV7 overexpression and

170

IFN stimulation (Data file S3 and Fig. S2E). To identify the types of genes, processes, and

171

functions impacted by overexpression of ETV7, we generated lists of the most downregulated

172

genes during ETV7 overexpression, both before and after IFN treatment, and performed gene set

173

enrichment analyses. This analysis technique takes a gene list and returns overrepresented terms

174

from gene and protein databases (37). In the absence of IFN treatment, the most significantly

175

enriched terms were not biological pathways, but rather ETS family transcription factor binding

176

motifs (Table S3); this is expected, as ETV7 is an ETS family member and the entire family binds

177

the same core motif, GGAA. In contrast, the genes specifically downregulated by ETV7 during

178

IFN treatment were highly enriched for processes and pathways associated with responses to

179

interferon and viral infection (Table S4). To visualize the effect of ETV7 upregulation specifically

180

on ISGs, we generated a heat map of the genes induced at least 2.5-fold upon IFN treatment in our

181

RNA sequencing experiment (Fig. 2I). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found some genes were

182

suppressed by ETV7 overexpression more than others (Fig. 2I).

183
184

Although we had previously immunoprecipitated ETV7 with ISRE-containing oligos (Fig. 2H),

185

we next wanted to demonstrate ETV7 occupancy on native ISG promoters for genes targeted by

186

ETV7 via chromatin immune-precipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR). To enable

187

these experiments, we first generated a FLAG-tagged ETV7 (Fig. S2E) and demonstrated that the

188

tag does not disrupt its ability to repress the IFN response reporter (Fig. S2F). We next selected

189

the promoter of IFI44L for ChIP analysis as it was both highly affected by ETV7 and also harbors

190

many ETS sites within ISRE-like sequences in its promoter (Fig. 2I and Fig. S2G and H). To

191

perform ChIP-qPCR, we generated sheared chromatin after cross-linking cells transfected with

192

FLAG-tagged ETV7 and treated with IFN-a. We then performed immunoprecipitation using either

193

nonspecific IgG or anti-FLAG antibodies raised in mice or rabbits. After qPCR analysis, we found

194

no enrichment for a negative control region (the gene desert on chromosome 12) between the IgG

195

and anti-FLAG samples (Fig. S2I). In contrast, DNA corresponding to the IFI44L promoter was

196

significantly enriched with both the rabbit and mouse anti-FLAG samples compared to the

197

nonspecific IgG samples (Fig. S2I). These experiments demonstrate that ETV7 acts as a

198

transcription factor to bind and suppress ISG promoters that containing GGAA motifs.

201

ETV7 loss enhances antiviral IFN-stimulated gene expression.

202

Our experiments up to this point had primarily utilized overexpression of ETV7. One major

203

disadvantage of this approach is the non-physiological kinetics and magnitude of ETV7 expression

204

relative to what is observed after IFN stimulation in cells (Fig. 3A). To define the physiological

205

effects of ETV7 induction during the IFN response, we performed a series of loss-of-function

206

experiments. Our expectation was that the knockout of ETV7 would have the reciprocal effect on

207

IFN responses as protein overexpression (38). We transduced A549-IFN response reporter cells

208

(the original reporter with ISRE +ETS sites) with Cas9 and separately, two independent sgRNAs

209

targeting ETV7, KO1(sg16667) and KO2(sg16668), generated pooled lines using antibiotic

210

selection, and then stimulated with IFN-a. Both guides resulted in significantly more IFN-induced

211

sfGFP expression compared to a control sgRNA (Fig. 3B, Fig. S3A).

212
213

We next generated clonal ETV7 knockout A549 lung epithelial cell lines (KO1-1, KO1-2) lacking

214

the reporter and sequenced the resulting DNA lesions to confirm ETV7 knockout. Since ETV7 is

215

normally only expressed after IFN stimulation, we treated with IFN-a and verified a reduction in

216

ETV7 expression at the RNA level, presumably via nonsense mediated RNA decay (Fig. 3C). A

217

representative housekeeping gene (ACTB) displayed no significant increases in transcription in

218

any of the ETV7 KO clones (Fig. 3D). We then selected twelve ISGs (IFITM1, RSAD2, OAS1-

219

3, IFIT1-3, IFI44L, ISG15, BST2, and IFI44) that were highly impacted by ETV7 in our RNA

a non-targeting guide, the ETV7 KO lines showed significant increases in induction of each of the

222

twelve ISGs (Fig. 3E-K, Fig. S3B-F). Thus, the physiological induction of ETV7 after IFN

223

stimulation affects the expression of ISGs.

Suppression of ETV7 enhances IFN-mediated control of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2.

In trying to predict the physiological significance of excessive induction of these ETV7-regulated

ISGs during the type I IFN response, we noted that many have recognized antiviral functions (2,

39, 40). To determine whether the effects of ETV7 suppression of ISG expression were relevant

231

in the context of a viral infection, we wanted to identify a virus restricted by the ISGs most affected

232

by ETV7 (41). Many of these genes with well-recognized antiviral functions (IFITM1, IFIT1-3,

233

OAS1-3, BST2, RSAD2) have been reported to play important roles in the restriction of influenza

234

viruses (42). IFITM1 has been shown to prevent viral entry (43), OAS proteins activate RNase L

235

to degrade viral RNA (44), IFITs bind viral RNA and promote antiviral signaling (45), and

236

BST2/Tetherin and RSAD2/Viperin restrict viral budding and egress (46, 47). Therefore, we

237

hypothesized that ETV7 dysregulation would affect influenza virus replication and spread.

238
239

We first infected our ETV7 KO A549 cells with a laboratory-adapted H1N1 influenza A virus

240

(IAV), A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8). Using a hemagglutination (HA) assay to measure the number

241

of viral particles released over time, we observed reduced virus production in our ETV7 KO cells

242

compared to control cells (Fig. 4A). This was the anticipated outcome because loss of a negative

243

regulator (i.e. ETV7) is expected to enhance expression of antiviral ISGs. We also measured

244

infectious viral titers and found a significant reduction in our ETV7 KO cells compared to control

245

cells (Fig. S4A). Using a fluorescent reporter strain of PR8 (PR8-mNeon) (48), we next visualized

246

infection and spread. As expected, we observed fewer cells expressing mNeon in ETV7 KO cells

247

using both microscopy (Fig. 4B) and flow cytometry readouts (Fig. 4C). We also tested whether

248

this phenotype would extend to a more contemporary H1N1 IAV strain, A/California/07/2009

249

(Cal/09), as well as an unrelated Victoria lineage influenza B virus strain, B/Malaysia/2506/2004

250

(Mal/04) (49). Using fluorescent reporter strains of these viruses, we observed significant

251

decreases in the number of Cal/09- and Mal/04-infected cells when comparing ETV7 KO cells to

252

control cells (Fig. 4D and E). In order to rule out non-IFN-related effects of ETV7 on inhibition

253

of influenza viral replication, we also performed these experiments with a non-influenza virus. We

254

selected Sendai virus (SeV) because, although it is known to induce a strong IFN response,

256

previous reports (50) show SeV replication is relatively unaffected by type I IFN. Furthermore,

257

many of the ISGs most impacted by ETV7 have little to no effect against SeV, including IFITM1

258

(51), IFIT1 (52), and BST2/Tetherin (53). Using of a fluorescent reporter SeV, we observed no

259

significant change in the number of infected cells when comparing ETV7 KO cells to control cells

260

(Fig. 4F).

261
262

In addition to physiological induction of IFN after infection, exogenous IFN treatment is

263

frequently utilized or proposed as an antiviral therapy (7), either when there is difficulty

264

developing targeted antivirals (e.g. hepatitis C virus (54)) or there is an unexpected emergence of

265

a viral pathogen (e.g. swine or highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (55), SARS-CoV (56),

266

Ebola virus (57), SARS-CoV-2 (58–60)). Therefore, we wanted to assess whether suppressing

267

ETV7 could be an effective strategy to enhance the antiviral effects of therapeutic IFN

268

administration. In support of this idea, we found treatment of ETV7 KO cells with IFN-a prior to

269

infection with PR8-mNeon led to an additional 5-fold enhancement of viral restriction compared

270

to IFN-treated WT control cells (Fig. 4G). Finally, since recent reports indicate that although

271

SARS-CoV-2 infections fail to induce a strong IFN responses (61–63), the virus is susceptible to

272

IFN treatment (64–66), we wanted to test if loss of ETV7 would potentiate IFN-mediated

273

suppression of SARS-CoV-2. With the same experimental design as the influenza virus

274

experiment, we found that pre-treatment of ETV7 KO cells with IFN-a resulted in a further 10-

275

fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 vRNA compared to IFN-treated control cells (Fig. 4H). This

276

enhanced control was likely mediated via the ISG LY6E, which potently restricts SARS-CoV-2

277

(67, 68) and we found to be regulated by ETV7 (Fig. S4B). Together, these experiments

278

demonstrate the potential of targeting ETV7 to enhance either the physiological or therapeutic

279

effects of IFN to control viral infection.

280
281

Discussion

282

In this study, we performed a CRISPR activation screen to identify negative regulators of the type

283

I IFN response. Specifically, we were interested in negative regulators that contribute to the types

284

of differentiated ISG profiles that are essential for effective control of viral infections. From this

285

screen, we identified ETV7 as a negative IFN regulator and subsequently showed it acts as a

286

transcription factor to repress subsets of ISGs through its recognized DNA binding motif. We also

287

demonstrated that the regulatory activity of ETV7 impacts the replication and spread of multiple

288

strains of influenza viruses. ETV7 loss also increased the antiviral effects of exogenous interferon

289

treatment against an H1N1 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate the

290

importance of ETV7 in fine-tuning the IFN response through specificity and transcriptional

291

repression to regulate antiviral ISG targets, and its potential as a target to enhance antiviral IFN-

292

based therapeutics.

293
294

ETV7 is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. This family performs diverse

295

functions despite recognizing the same core DNA sequence, GGAA. Because these factors share

296

the same core motif, specificities are gained in other ways such as expression patterns (cell type,

297

basal expression, or immune pathway induction), active or repressive activity, and potential

298

binding partners (69, 70). ETV7 is induced as an ISG and is repressive, whereas most ETS

299

transcription factors are activators, including ETS transcription factors recognized to assist in the

300

induction of ISG expression (e.g. ELF1 (25), PU.1 (71)). We also found repeatedly in our work

301

that the reporters and genes impacted by ETV7 contained ETS sites within ISRE sequences (Fig.

302

2E-H, S2G-I, S4B). This is not unexpected because it is recognized that many ETS family

303

members bind extended motifs similar to ISREs called ETS-IRF composite elements (EICE) (72).

304

EICE-associated activity is reported to require an IRF binding partner to direct ETS transcription

305

factor activity (71, 73); therefore, it is likely ETV7 has an IRF binding partner. If ETV7 does

306

require a binding partner, this protein’s induction and distribution likely contribute to the timing,

307

gene targets, and activity of ETV7 during the IFN response. It is known that IRFs can be basally

308

expressed (IRF2, IRF3), IFN-induced (IRF1, IRF7), or IFN-responsive (IRF9) (72), and the

309

availability of a binding partner could dramatically affect the timing and magnitude of effects on

310

EICE-controlled ISGs. Future work will define if ETV7 has specific binding partners and how

311

those interactions may contribute to the nonuniform, repressive activity of ETV7 during the type

312

I IFN response reported in this study.

313
314

IFN-induced regulators control the magnitude and duration of IFN responses in addition to the

315

temporal regulation of specific waves of ISGs (74). These coordinated waves of ISG induction can

316

peak early or late during the IFN response and are thought to correspond to specific stages of virus

317

replication or immune processes (1, 6). We compared the induction of ETV7 with IFI44L, IFIT1,

318

ISG15 and RSAD2, and we observed ETV7 is upregulated at earlier time points than these

319

prototypical ISGs (Fig. 3A). We expanded our analysis to published datasets of human gene

320

expression during respiratory infections and concluded that ETV7 is generally induced earlier than

321

many ISGs (75). Although not the focus of our study, ETV7’s early induction pattern suggests it

322

may be a key regulator of the first stages of IFN-mediated gene induction. We favor a model

19

323

wherein early ETV7 expression is responsible for reducing the accumulation, or delaying the

324

expression, of ISGs controlled by ISREs and promoters containing ETS motifs.

325
326

ETV7 is induced during infections across many vertebrate species (76, 77), indicating a potential

327

conserved, relevant role in the immune response; however, ETV7 has been lost in mice and closely

328

related rodents (78). Since mice and rodents have an intact interferon response pathway, a natural

329

question is: how are the activities of ETV7 being accounted for in these animals? While we have

330

no clear answer from the data in this study, it is well-recognized that IFN responses contain many

331

redundancies (41). Accordingly, we believe other ETS family members, potentially the closely

332

related ETV6 (which is also induced by IFNs), may perform the role of ETV7 in mice (79). Future

333

studies will be required to test the hypothesis that mice induce an ETV7-related alternative during

334

the type I IFN response.

335
336

Another important question is why the IFN-induced activity of ETV7 has been maintained

337

throughout evolution. In this report, we provide evidence that ETV7’s activity reduces a cell’s

338

ability to restrict virus infection; this seems counterintuitive to ETV7 benefitting the host. We

339

hypothesize that regulators like ETV7 are important to prevent excessive inflammatory signaling.

340

It is appreciated that negative regulators of the IFN response are required to prevent extreme and

341

prolonged immune responses, which are associated with poor disease outcomes after infection

342

(80–82). ETV7 potentially contributes to the cumulative activities of negative IFN regulators to

343

limit IFN responses during pathogen clearance. Additionally, it stands to reason that individual

344

ISGs have different toxic effects on the cell. It is tempting to speculate that ETV7 suppresses ISGs

345

whose accumulation is particularly harmful to cell viability and host recovery after infection.

347

Additionally, the relevance of controlled IFN responses goes beyond infectious disease; patients

348

with dysfunctional USP18, a negative regulator of the IFN response, develop a type I

349

interferonopathy that results in a severe pseudo-TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Other agents, Rubella,

350

Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex) syndrome (83). Mouse knockouts for other negative

351

regulators of the IFN response (SOCS1, SOCS3, USP18) also develop non-pathogen associated,

352

chronic inflammatory diseases (84–87). ETV7’s lack of a murine homolog eliminates an easily

353

generated animal knockout model to experimentally show ETV7’s relevance as a general innate

354

immune repressor. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked ETV7 to

355

autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (88, 89); both of these

356

autoimmune diseases have evidence of enhanced ISG expression (90, 91). Thus, although the

357

specific contributions of ETV7 activity to IFN regulation are currently undefined, its potential role

358

is not limited to viral infections.

359
360

In conclusion, this study identified ETV7 as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response.

361

Previously, ETV7 was appreciated to be an ISG; however, a specific function during the IFN

362

response was unknown. We determined that ETV7 acts as a transcription factor to target specific

363

ISGs for repression, potentially contributing to the complex ISG transcriptional landscape.

364

Additionally, many of the ETV7-regulated ISGs restrict respiratory viruses (42, 67, 68), and we

365

showed that loss of ETV7 can further enhance the ability of type I IFN to control influenza virus

366

and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Further work is required to understand the complexity of IFN

367

regulation, while therapeutic targeting of factors like ETV7 could lead to the development of a

368

new class of host-directed antivirals that can enhance or tailor ISG responses to specific viruses.

Materials and Methods

370

Cloning

371

To generate reporters sensitive to IFN, we designed gBlocks (IDT) containing ISREs to be cloned

372

into the pTRIP vector ahead of a minimal CMV promoter controlling expression of sfGFP. To

373

clone and express the open reading frames (ORFs) of our screen hits, we designed primers for

374

cloning into the pLEX-MCS vector using Gibson Assembly (NEB). To amplify ETV7, NUP153

375

and USP18 we used cDNA templates from Transomic Technologies. To amplify C1GALT1 and

376

EIF2AK1 we used RNA from IFN-stimulated A549 cells. The DNA binding mutant ETV7,

377

ETV7(KALK) (35), and codon-optimized SOCS1 expression plasmids were generated using a

378

gBlock (IDT). FLAG-tagged ETV7, ETV7(FLAG), was generated using a primer including the

379

FLAG tag. Non-targeting and ETV7-targeting CRISPR KO sgRNAs were cloned by annealing

380

oligos encoding the desired sgRNA sequence and ligating them directly into the lentiCRISPRv2

381

vector (Addgene). DNA was transformed into NEB 5-alpha high efficiency competent cells. Insert

382

size was verified with PCR and purified plasmids were sequenced using Sanger sequencing.

383
384

Cells

385

All cells were obtained from ATCC and grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. A549 and 293T cells were

386

grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine

387

serum, GlutaMAX, and penicillin-streptomycin. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were

388

grown in minimal essential media (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, HEPES,

389

NaHCO3, GlutaMAX, and penicillin-streptomycin. The A549 CRISPR-SAM cells were

390

previously validated (92) and transduced with the IFN response reporter three times before being

391

clonally selected. The A549 CRISPR KO cells were transduced (ETV7 KO1 = sg16667, ETV7

392

KO2 = sg16668, nontargeting control) and then selected using puromycin (10 µg/mL). A549-IFN

393

response reporter ETV7 KO lines were selected with puromycin and used as pooled lines. A549

394

ETV7 KO lines were selected with puromycin and subsequently plated at a dilution to isolate

395

single cells, which were grown until colonies of an appropriate size allowed for collection. These

396

clonally selected colonies were grown up and verified to be KO lines (control, KO1-1, KO1-2,

434

The sgRNA library was packaged into lentivirus as previously described (92). After packaging

435

and titering the lentivirus, 2x108 A549-CRISPR-SAM-IFN response reporter cells were seeded

436

onto 15 cm plates (10 plates total). The next day they were transduced with the packaged sgRNA

437

library (MOI=0.5). After 48 h, the transduced cells were split and half were collected as a

438

transduction control, while the remaining half were plated back onto 15 cm plates. The next day,

439

cells were treated with IFN-a (4x103 U/mL) for 6 h. Cells were then collected and sorted on a

440

Beckman Coulter Astrios cell sorter. Specifically, gates were set to sort GFP-negative cells as the

441

population of interest, as well as GFP-positive cells as a control population of cells still capable of

442

signaling. This screen was performed in duplicate. Genomic DNA was extracted from sorted cells

443

using the Zymo Quick gDNA micro prep kit. PCR was subsequently performed using barcoded

444

primers as previously described using the NEB Next High Fidelity 2x PCR master mix (92). PCR

445

bands were gel purified using the Thermo GeneJET gel extraction kit. Samples were then

446

sequenced via next-generation Illumina MiSeq using paired-end 150 bp reads.

447
448

Screen Analysis

449

Raw MiSeq read files were aligned to the CRISPR SAM sgRNA library and raw reads for each

450

sgRNA were counted using the MAGeCK pipeline (29). sgRNA enrichment was determined using

451

the generated count files and the MAGeCK-MLE analysis pipeline. Genes were sorted based on

452

z-score and determined to be significantly enriched if their z-score was at least two standard

453

deviations above the average z-score of the entire sorted population.

Cells were trypsinized and 1x106 cells were pelleted at 800 x g for 5 min. Equal amounts of cellular

460

Primary antibodies were then incubated with the membrane overnight at 4°C. Antibodies used

461

were rabbit anti-ETV7 (Sigma, HPA029033), rabbit anti-IFIT1 (Cell Signaling, D2X9Z), mouse

462

anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165) and mouse anti-atubulin (Sigma, T5168). Membranes were washed

463

five times in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and then an anti-rabbit-HRP (Thermo, A16104) or anti-

464

mouse-HRP (Thermo, A16072) secondary antibody was added for 1 h. The membrane was then

465

washed five times and Clarity or Clarity Max ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) was added before being

466

exposed to film and developed.

483

Nuclear extract from 293T cells expressing ETV7 and treated with IFN-a (100 U/mL, 9 h) was

484

generated using NE-PER extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific). This nuclear extract was

485

incubated with poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA, 10x ligase buffer (Invitrogen), 200

486

mM EDTA, biotinylated DNA bait (either WT or -ETS ISG15 ISRE (93)), and 20x excess

487

nonbiotinylated DNA competitor for 30 min at room temperature. This mixture was then incubated

488

with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen), followed by four washes with TTBS.

489

Proteins bound to the biotinylated DNA bait captured by the streptavidin beads were eluted with

490

protein sample buffer and then detected by Western blot. Input (nuclear extract) was diluted 1:200

491

for loading. No bait (control) contained no biotinylated DNA.

492
493

RNA sequencing

494

293T cells were transfected with ETV7- or control-expressing plasmids and selected using

495

puromycin (20 µg/mL) for 24 h before treatment with IFN-a (100 U/mL). Total RNA was

496

collected at 9 h post-IFN treatment using Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kits (NEB). RNA was

497

prepped for RNA sequencing submission using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation

498

Module (NEB), NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB), and NEBNext

499

Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB). Samples were analyzed on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq

500

4000 using 50 bp single strand reads. Mapping of the raw reads to the human hg19 reference

501

genome was accomplished using a custom application on the Illumina BaseSpace Sequence Hub

502

(94). After data normalization, average read values were compared across samples. For

503

comparisons in which some samples had zero reads detected for a specific gene, one read was

504

added to all values in the sample to complete analyses that required non-zero values. The heat map

505

shows genes upregulated 2.5-fold (after normalization) with IFN treatment in the control samples.

506

Values shown are z-scores.

ChIP-qPCR

509

293T cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged ETV7-expressing plasmid, ETV7(FLAG), 48 h

510

before treatment with IFN-a (100 U/mL, 9 h). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed

511

using the ChIP-IT Express Enzymatic kit according to the manufacturer’s directions (Active

512

Motif). DNA was enzymatically sheared for 10 min. ChIP antibodies included mouse IgG (Active

513

Motif), rabbit anti-FLAG (Cell Signaling, 14793S), and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165).

514

Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) and primers targeting the Chr12

515

gene

516

TTTCATGCCTGCCTACATAC 3’, reverse primer = 5’ ATGCCAACTGCCACTAAC 3’) in a

Viruses

521

PR8-mNeon was generated via insertion of the mNeon fluorescent gene (95) into segment 4 of the

522

virus (48). Mal/04-mNeon was generated by inserting the mNeon fluorescent gene (95) into

523

segment 4 of the Mal/04 genome (49). Cal/09-sfGFP was generated via insertion of the sfGFP

524

gene (96) into segment 8 of the virus using the same scheme previously used to insert Cre

525

recombinase (97). Sendai-GFP was a gift from Benhur Lee (98). For influenza virus infections,

526

cells were either mock- or virus-infected for 1 h and then cultured in OptiMEM supplemented with

527

bovine serum albumin (BSA), penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.2 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin

528

protease (Sigma). For Sendai infections, cells were infected for 1 h and then cultured in DMEM.

529

For SARS-CoV-2 infections, cells were washed with PBS before infection with SARS-CoV-

530

2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 from BEI Resources in 2% FBS DMEM infection media for 1 hour.

531

PR8 WT, PR8-mNeon, Cal/09-sfGFP, Sendai-GFP, and SARS-CoV-2 were incubated at 37°C,

532

Mal/04-mNeon was incubated at 33°C.

Viral Growth Assays

535

Hemagglutination (HA) assays to measure the number of viral particles were performed by diluting

536

influenza infected cell supernatants collected at the indicated time points in cold PBS. An equal

537

amount of chicken blood diluted 1:40 in PBS was mixed with serially diluted virus and incubated

538

at 4°C for 2-3 h before scoring. Infectious viral titers were determined using standard plaque assay

539

procedures on MDCK cells. Infected cell supernatants were collected at 18 h, serially diluted, and

540

used to infect confluent 6-well plates for 1 h before removing the virus and adding the agar overlay.

541

Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 48 h before being fixed in 4% PFA overnight. The 4% PFA

542

was then aspirated, and the agar layer was removed before washing cells with PBS. Serum from

543

WT PR8 infected mice was diluted 1:2,000 in antibody dilution buffer (5% (w/v) non-fat dried

544

milk and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) and incubated on cells at 4°C overnight. Cells were then

545

washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-

546

conjugated sheep antibody (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:4,000 in antibody dilution buffer. Assays

547

were then washed twice with PBS and exposed to 0.5 mL of TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL)

548

for 20 min. Plates were then washed with water and dried before plaques were counted.
