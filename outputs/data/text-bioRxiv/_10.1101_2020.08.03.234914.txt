Abstract
We used two approaches to design proteins with shape and chemical complementarity to the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein near the binding site for the
human ACE2 receptor. Scaffolds were built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the RBD,
or de novo designed scaffolds were docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes. In
both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target
binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to
10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC50 values ranging
from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these — 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made
using the second approach — are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC50 ~
0.23 ng/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far. Cryo-electron microscopy
structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent
minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD
are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike
protein can be engaged simultaneously. These hyperstable minibinders provide promising
starting points for new SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, and illustrate the power of computational
protein design for rapidly generating potential therapeutic candidates against pandemic threats.
Main text
SARS-CoV-2 infection generally begins in the nasal cavity, with virus replicating there for
several days before spreading to the lower respiratory tract (1). Delivery of a high concentration
of a viral inhibitor into the nose and into the respiratory system generally might therefore provide
prophylactic protection and/or therapeutic benefit for treatment of early infection, and could be
particularly useful for healthcare workers and others coming into frequent contact with infected
individuals. A number of monoclonal antibodies are in development as systemic treatments for
COVID-19 (2-6), but these proteins are not ideal for intranasal delivery as antibodies are large
and often not extremely stable molecules and the density of binding sites is low (two per 150
KDa. antibody); antibody-dependent disease enhancement (7-9) is also a potential issue. Highaffinity Spike protein binders that block the interaction with the human cellular receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (10) with enhanced stability and smaller sizes to

maximize the density of inhibitory domains could have advantages over antibodies for direct
delivery into the respiratory system through intranasal administration, nebulization or dry powder
aerosol. We found previously that intranasal delivery of small proteins designed to bind tightly
to the influenza hemagglutinin can provide both prophylactic and therapeutic protection in
rodent models of lethal influenza infection (11).
We set out to design high-affinity protein minibinders to the COVID-19 Spike RBD that compete
with ACE2 binding. We explored two strategies: first we incorporated the alpha-helix from ACE2
which makes the majority of the interactions with the RBD into small designed proteins that
make additional interactions with the RBD to attain higher affinity (Fig 1A). Second, we
designed binders completely from scratch without relying on known RBD-binding interactions
(Fig 1B). An advantage of the second approach is that the range of possibilities for design is
much larger, and so potentially a greater diversity of high-affinity binding modes can be
identified. For the first approach, we used the Rosetta blueprint builder to generate miniproteins
which incorporate the ACE2 helix (human ACE2 residues 23 to 46 ). For the second approach,
we used RIF docking (12) and design using large miniprotein libraries (11) to generate binders
to distinct regions of the RBD surface surrounding the ACE2 binding site (Fig 1 and Fig S1).
Large pools of designed minibinders (see Methods) made using the first and second
approaches, were encoded in long oligonucleotides and screened for binding to fluorescently
tagged RBD displayed on the surface of yeast cells. Deep sequencing identified three ACE2
helix scaffolded designs (Approach 1), and 105 de novo interface designs (Approach 2) that
were enriched following fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for RBD binding. All three
ACE2-scaffolded designs and twelve of the de novo designs were expressed in E. coli and
purified. One of the ACE2-scaffolded designs expressed solubly and bound RBD with an affinity
of ~2 uM in biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments (Fig S2). Eleven of the twelve de novo
designs were soluble and bound RBD with affinities ranging from 100nM to 2uM (Fig S3).
Affinity maturation of the ACE2-scaffolded design by PCR mutagenesis led to a variant, AHB1,
which bound RBD with an affinity of ~1 nM (Fig 3A) and blocked binding of ACE2 to the RBD
(Fig S4), consistent with the design model.
For 50 minibinders made using Approach 2, we generated site saturation mutagenesis libraries
(SSMs) in which every residue in each design was substituted with each of the 20 amino acids
one at a time. Deep sequencing before and after FACS sorting for RBD binding revealed that
residues at the binding interface and protein core were largely conserved in 40 out of the 50
cases (Fig 2 and Fig S5). For most of these minibinders, a small number of substitutions were
enriched in the FACS sorting; combinatorial libraries incorporating these substitutions were
constructed for the eight highest affinity designs and again screened for binding to the RBD at
concentrations down to 20pM. Each library converged on a small number of closely related
sequences; one of these was selected for each design (LCB1-LCB8) and found to bind the RBD
with high affinity on the yeast surface in a manner competed by ACE2 (Fig 3 and Fig S6).
LCB1–LCB8 were expressed, purified from E. coli, and binding to the RBD assessed by BLI.
For six of the designs, the KD values ranged from 1–20 nM (Fig 3 and Fig S6), and for two
(LCB1 and LCB3), the KD values were below 1 nM, which is too strong to measure reliably with
this technique (Fig 3). On the surface of yeast cells, LCB1 and LCB3 showed binding signals at
5 pM of RBD following protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) treatment (Fig S7). Circular
dichroism spectra of the purified minibinders were consistent with the design models, and the
melting temperatures for most were greater than 90C (Figure 3 and FigS6). The designs
retained full binding activity after 14 days at room temperature (Fig S8).

We characterized the structures of LCB1 and LCB3 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike
ectodomain trimer at 2.7 Å and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively, revealing stoichiometric binding of
the minibinders to each RBD within the spike trimer (Fig 4 A-B, E-F and Fig S9, S11). Although
the spike predominantly harbored two open RBDs for both complexes, we identified a subset of
particles with three RBDs open for the LCB3 complex (Fig 4 A-B, E-F and Fig S9, S11). We
subsequently improved the resolvability of the RBD/LCB1 and RBD/LCB3 densities using
focused classification and local refinement yielding maps at 3.1 and 3.5 Å resolution enabling
visualization of the interactions formed by each minibinder with the RBD (Fig 4 C, G and Fig
S9-12).
LCB1 and LCB3 dock with opposite orientations in the crevice formed by the RBD receptorbinding motif through extensive electrostatic interactions and shape complementarity mediated
by two out of the three minibinder ɑ-helices (Fig 4 C-D, G-H). Similar to ACE2, the LCB1 and
LCB3 binding sites are buried in the closed S conformational state and require opening of at
least two RBDs to allow simultaneous recognition of the three binding sites (Fig 4 A-B, E-F).
Both LCB1 and LCB3 form numerous hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with the receptorbinding motif resulting in the burial of a surface area of ~1,000Å^2 and ~800Å^2, respectively
(Fig S10 and Fig S12). The extensive networks of polar and hydrophobic interactions explain
the subnanomolar affinities of these inhibitors. As designed, the binding sites for LCB1 and
LCB3 overlap with that of ACE2, and hence should compete for binding to the RBD and inhibit
viral attachment at the host cell surface.
Superimposition of the designed LCB1/RBD or LCB3/RBD models to the corresponding cryoEM
structures, using the RBD as reference, show that the binding poses closely match the design
with backbone Cɑ rmsd of 1.27 Å and 1.9Å for LCB1 and LCB3, respectively (Fig. 4D, H) and
most of the polar interactions in the design models match nicely with the CryoEM structure (Fig
S10, S12). These data show that the computational design method can have quite high
accuracy. The structure comparisons in Fig. 4D and 4H are to the original design models; the
substitutions that increased binding affinity are quite subtle and have very little effect on
backbone geometry.
We investigated the capacity of AHB1 and LCB1-5 to prevent infection of human cells by bona
fide SARS-CoV-2. Varying concentrations of minibinders were incubated with 100 focus-forming
units (FFU) of SARS-CoV-2 and then added to Vero E6 monolayers. AHB1 strongly neutralized
SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 of 35nM), whereas a control influenza minibinder showed no neutralization
activity (Fig 5A). Next, we tested the Approach 2 designed minibinders LCB1-5. We observed
even more potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by LCB1 and LCB3 with IC50 values of 34.46pM
and 48.1pM, respectively (Fig 5B). On a molar basis, these values are approximately 6-fold
lower than the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody described to date (13); on a
mass basis, because of their very small size, the designs are more potent than any of these
antibodies.
The minibinders designed in this work have potential advantages over antibodies as potential
therapeutics. Together, they span a range of binding modes, and in combination viral mutational
escape would be quite unlikely (Fig S1). The retention of activity after extended time at elevated
temperatures suggests they might not require a cold chain. The designs are 20-fold smaller than
a full antibody molecule, and hence in an equal mass have 20-fold more potential neutralizing
sites, increasing the potential efficacy of a locally administered drug. The cost of goods and the
ability to scale to very high production should be lower for the much simpler miniproteins, which
unlike antibodies, do not require expression in mammalian cells for proper folding. The small
size and high stability should also make them amenable to formulation in a gel for nasal

application, and to direct delivery into the respiratory system by nebulization or as a dry powder.
We will be exploring alternative routes of delivery in the months ahead as we seek to translate
the high potency neutralizing proteins into SARS-Cov2 therapeutics and prophylactics.
Immunogenicity is a potential problem with any foreign molecule, but for previously
characterized small de novo designed proteins little or no immune response has been observed
(11, 14), perhaps because the high solubility and stability together with the small size makes
presentation on dendritic cells less likely.
Timing is critical in a pandemic outbreak: potent therapeutics are needed in as short a time as
possible. We began to design minibinders in January 2020 based on a Rosetta model of the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike structure and switched to the crystal structures once they became available.
By the end of May 2020, we had identified very potent neutralizers of infectious virus; during
this same time, a number of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were identified. We believe that
with continued development, the computational design approach can become much faster. First,
as structure prediction methods continue to increase in accuracy, target models suitable for
design could be generated within a day of determining the genome sequence of a new
pathogen. Second, with continued improvement in computational design methods, it should be
possible to streamline the workflow described here, which required screening of large sets of
computational designs, followed by experimental optimization, to identify very high affinity
binders. The very close agreement of the cryoEM structures of LCB1 and LCB2 with the
computational design models suggest that the main challenges to overcome are not in the de
novo design of proteins with shape and chemical complementarity to the target surface, but in
recognizing the best candidates and identifying a small number of affinity increasing
substitutions. The large amount of data collected in protein interface design experiments such
as those described here should inform the improvement of the detailed atomic models at the
core of Rosetta design calculations, as well as complementary machine learning approaches,
to enable recognition and improved sequence design of the best candidates; this would enable
the rapid in silico design of pM inhibitors like LCB1 and LCB3. With continued methods
development, we believe that it will become possible to generate ultra-high-affinity, pathogen
neutralizing designs within weeks of obtaining genome sequence. Preparing against unknown
future pandemics is difficult, and such a capability could be an important component of a
general response strategy.

Material and Methods
Designing miniprotein binders based on the ACE2 helix
The crystal structure (PDB: 6M0J) of the RBD bound to ACE2 (4) was refined with the Rosetta
FastRelax protocol with coordinate constraints, and the main binding helix of ACE2 (residue 23 46) was extracted and used as the starting point for miniprotein generation. Miniprotein binder
generation began by defining a variety of 3-helical bundles using the RosettaRemodel blueprint
(15)} format with the requirement that the ACE2 helix was incorporated into one of the helices.
1,974 blueprints that differed in the lengths of the helices and the loop types were generated.
The blueprints were used to generate backbones using the Rosetta Monte Carlo-based
fragment assembly protocol (16), while keeping the ACE2 helix fixed. Specially, the RBD
structure was loaded into a hashing grid for fast clash checking to guarantee the newly
generated backbones are not clashing with the RBD. The generated miniprotein was subjected
to a 3-stage sequence design protocol. Firstly, only interface residues on the miniproteins were
designed using the PackRotamersMover to quickly select designs that could make extra
contacts with RBD basides of the ACE2 helix. The whole miniprotein except the key interacting
residues on the ACE2 helix were then designed using the FastDesign protocol, activating
between side-chain rotamer optimization and gradient-descent-based energy minimization.
Lastly, the interface residues were further optimized with another round of FastDesign to
improve shape and chemically complementary. The monomeric metrics and the interface
metrics were calculated using Rosetta. Top 5,000 designs were selected based on the protein
folding metrics (score_pre_res, buried non-polar area, local structure and sequence agreement)
and interface metrics (ddg, shape complementarity, interface buried solvent accessible area).
Both the quality of the designed monomeric structure and the accuracy of designed interface
interactions are important for successfully making miniprotein binders, which is hard to achieve
through one Monte Carlo fragment assembly trajectory. Thus, we performed a second-round
design based on the above generated design models. In detail, 273 helix hairpins that make
good contacts with the RBD are selected based on the above-mentioned interface metrics.
Starting from these helix hairpins, the third helix was built using the same fragment assembly
protocol. Sequence design was performed on the generated backbone, except the first stage
sequence design was omitted. The outputs were filtered by protein folding metrics and interface
binding metrics, and 18,000 designs were selected.
De novo binder design
The crystal structure (PDB: 6M0J) of the RBD bound to ACE2 (4) was refined with the Rosetta
FastRelax protocol with coordinate constraints, and the RBD subunit was extracted for
subsequent steps. Initial docking conformations were generated by RifDock (12). Briefly, billions
of individual disembodied amino acids were docked against the ACE2 binding region on RBD
using RifDock. The ones that passed a specific energy cutoff value (-1.5 Rosettta energy unit)
were stored and the corresponding inverse rotamers were generated. The de novo scaffold
library (11) of 19,000 mini-proteins (in length 56 - 65 residues) were docked into the field of the
inverse rotamers to produce initial docked conformations. These docked conformations were

further optimized using the FastDesign protocol to generate shape and chemically
complementary interfaces. Computational metrics of the final design models were calculated
using Rosetta, which includes ddg, shape complementary and interface buried solvent
accessible surface area. Top 100,000 designs based on the above metrics were selected and
an Agilent DNA library were ordered for DNA synthesis.

All protein sequences were padded to a uniform length (88 aa for approach 1 and 65 for
approach 2) by adding a (GGGS)n linker at the C terminal of the designs, to avoid the biased
amplification of short DNA fragments during PCR reactions. The protein sequences were
reversed translated and optimized using DNAworks2.0 (17) with the S. cerevisiae codon
frequency table. Homologous to the pETCON plasmid Oligo libraries encoding the ACE2 helix
scaffolded designs were ordered from Twist Bioscience. Oligo pool encoding the de novo
designs and the point mutant library were ordered from Agilent Technologies. The error-prone
library of the initial hit of the ACE2 helix scaffolded design was constructed by error-prone PCR
with a GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) with manufacturer's
instructions. 3 to 4 mutations were found on each sequence as verified by colony sequencing.
Combinatorial libraries were ordered as IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) ultramers with the
final DNA diversity ranging from 1e6 to 1e7.

All libraries were amplified using Kapa HiFi Polymerase (Kapa Biosystems) with a qPCR
machine (BioRAD CFX96). In detail, the libraries were firstly amplified in a 25 ul reaction, and
PCR reaction was terminated when the reaction reached half the maximum yield to avoid over
amplification. The PCR product was loaded to a DNA agarose gel. The band with the expected
size was cut out and DNA fragments were extracted using QIAquick kits (Qiagen Inc). Then, the
DNA product was re-amplified as before to generate enough DNA for yeast transformation. The
final PCR product was cleaned up with a QIAquick Clean up kit (Qiagen Inc). For the yeast
transformation, 2-3 µg of digested modified pETcon vector (pETcon3) and 6 µg of insert were
transformed into EBY100 yeast strain using the protocol as described in (11).

Research). Illumina adapters and 6-bp pool-specific barcodes were added in the second qPCR
step. Gel extraction was used to get the final DNA product for sequencing. All libraries include
the native library and different sorting pools were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq/MiSeq

S. cerevisiae EBY100 strain cultures were grown in C-Trp-Ura media and induced in SGCAA
media following the protocol in (11) . Cells were washed with PBSF (PBS with 1% BSA) and
labelled with biotinylated RBD using two labeling methods, with-avidity and without-avidity
labeling. For the with-avidity method, the cells were incubated with biotinylated RBD, together
with anti-c-Myc fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Miltenyi Biotech) and streptavidin–
phycoerythrin (SAPE, ThermoFisher). The concentration of SAPE in the with-avidity method
was used at ¼ concentration of the biotinylated RBD. The with-avidity method was used in the
first few rounds of screening of the original design to fish out weak binder candidates. For the
without-avidity method, the cells were firstly incubated with biotinylated RBD, washed,
secondarily labelled with SAPE and FITC. For the ACE2 helix scaffolded designs, three rounds

of with-avidity sorts were applied at 1 uM concentration of RBD. For the original library of de
novo designs, the library was sorted twice using the with-avidity method at 1 uM RBD, followed
by several without-avidity sort in the third round of sorting with RBD concentrations at 1uM,
100nM and 10 nM. The SSM library was screened using the without-avidity method for four
rounds, with RBD concentrations at 1uM, 100nm, 10nM and 1nM. The error-prone library and
the combinatorial libraries were sorted to convergence by decreasing the target concentration
with each subsequent sort and collecting only the top 0.1% of the binding population. The final
sorting pool of the error-prone library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq kit to identify all
beneficial mutations. The final sorting pools of the combinatorial libraries were plated on C-trpura plates and the sequences of individual clones were determined by Sanger sequencing.

For protease treatment, the cells were firstly washed with TBS (20 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl pH
8.0). Protolysis was initiated by adding 250 µL of room temperature TBS with 1 uM of trypsin
and 0.5 uM of chymotrypsin, followed by vortexing and incubating the reaction at room
temperature for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 mL of chilled PBSF, and cells
were immediately washed 4x in chilled PBSF. The cells were then labeled with RBD using the
above mentioned protocol.

Genes encoding the designed protein sequences were synthesized and cloned into modified
pET-29b(+) E. coli plasmid expression vectors (GenScript, N-terminal 8× His-tagged followed by
a TEV cleavage site). For all the designed proteins, the sequence of the N-terminal tag used is
MSHHHHHHHHSENLYFQSGGG (unless otherwise noted), which is followed immediately by
the sequence of the designed protein. Plasmids were then transformed into chemically
competent E. coli Lemo21 cells (NEB). Protein expression was performed using the Studier
autoinduction media supplemented with antibiotic, and grown overnight. The cells were
harvested by spinning at 4,000xg for 10 min and then resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mM
NaCl, 30 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, with 0.25% CHAPS for cell assay samples) with DNAse and
protease inhibitor tablets. The cells were lysed with a QSONICA SONICATORS sonicator for 4
minutes total (2 minutes on time, 10 sec on-10 sec off) with an amplitude of 80%. Then the
soluble fraction was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was
purified by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (Qiagen) followed by FPLC sizeexclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). All protein samples were
characterized with SDS-PAGE with the purity higher than 95%. Protein concentrations were
determined by absorbance at 280 nm measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific) using predicted extinction coefficients.

Far-ultraviolet CD measurements were carried out with an JASCO-1500 equipped with a
temperature-controlled multi-cell holder. Wavelength scans were measured from 260 to 190 nm
at 25, 95°C and again at 25°C after fast refolding (~5 min). Temperature melts monitored
dichroism signal at 222 nm in steps of 2°C/minute with 30s of equilibration time. Wavelength
scans and temperature melts were performed using 0.3 mg/ml protein in PBS buffer (20mM
NaPO4, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with a 1 mm path-length cuvette.

Melting temperatures were determined fitting the data with a sigmoid curve equation. 7 out of
the 9 designs retained more than half of the mean residue ellipticity values, which indicated the
Tm values are greater than 95°C. Tm values of AHB1 and LCB2 were determined as the
inflection point of the fitted function.

Biolayer interferometry binding data were collected in an Octet RED96 (ForteBio) and
processed using the instrument’s integrated software. For minibinder binding assays,
biotinylated RBD (Acro Biosystems, for de novo miniprotein binders) or Fc tagged RBD (kindly
provided by Erik Procko, for the ACE2 helix scaffolded binders) was loaded onto streptavidincoated biosensors (SA ForteBio) or proteinA biosensors (ProteinA ForteBio) at 20 nM in binding
buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P20, 0.5% nonfat dry milk) for 360 s. Analyte proteins were diluted from concentrated stocks into binding
buffer. After baseline measurement in the binding buffer alone, the binding kinetics were
monitored by dipping the biosensors in wells containing the target protein at the indicated
concentration (association step) and then dipping the sensors back into baseline/buffer
(dissociation). For the ACE2 competition assay, ACE2-Fc protein (house made) was loaded
onto proteinA biosensors (SA ForteBio) at 20 nM in binding buffer for 360 s, and the RBD
protein (house made) was used as the ligand with a concentration of 100 nM. AHB1 protein was
diluted into the ligand well at the indicated concentrations. Same Octet protocol as above
mentioned was applied for acquiring the association and dissociation spectrums.
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay
SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019 n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 was obtained from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (gift of Natalie Thornburg). Virus stocks were produced in Vero CCL81
cells (ATCC) and titrated by focus-forming assay on Vero E6 cells. Serial dilutions of
minibinders were incubated with 102 focus-forming units (FFU) of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C.
RBD binder-virus complexes were added to Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well plates and
incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Next, cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM
supplemented to contain 2% FBS. Plates were harvested 30 h later by removing overlays and
fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and sequentially
incubated with 1 µg/mL of CR3022 (5) anti-S antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-human
IgG in PBS supplemented to contain 0.1% saponin and 0.1% BSA. SARS-CoV-2-infected cell
foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an
ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies). Data was processed using Prism software
(GraphPad Prism 8.0).
Cryo Electron microscopy
To prepare SARS-CoV-2 S/LCB complexes, 10-fold molar excesses of LCB1 or LCB3 were
incubated with SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro Spike protein (18) for 1 h on ice, and the complexes were
purified on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column. 3 μL of 1 mg/ml purified SARS-CoV
S/LCB complexes were loaded onto a freshly glow-discharged (30 s at 20 mA) 1.2/1.3
UltrAuFoil grid (300 mesh) prior to plunge freezing using a vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher
Scientific) using a blot force of 0 and 5.5 second blot time at 100% humidity and 25°C. Data
were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV
and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter,
operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out
using Leginon at a nominal magnification of 130,000x with a pixel size of 0.525 Å. The dose rate
was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in super-resolution mode

fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms. 2,500 micrographs were collected with a defocus range
between -0.5 and -2.5 μm. Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrasttransfer function parameters, particle picking, and extraction were carried out using Warp.
Particle images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400 yielding a pixel size of 1.05
Å. Reference-free 2D classification was performed using CryoSPARC to select well-defined
particle images. These selected particles were subjected to 3D classification in Relion. 3D
refinements were carried out using non-uniform refinement along with per-particle defocus
refinement in CryoSPARC. Selected particle images were subjected to the Bayesian polishing
procedure implemented in Relion3.0. After determining a refined 3D structure, the particles were
then subjected to focus 3D classification without refining angles and shifts using a soft mask on
Receptor binding motif (RBM) and LCB region with a tau value of 60. articles belonging to
classes with the best resolved LCB1/3 density were selected and subject to local refinement
with CryoSPARC, resulting in 3D reconstructions with improved quality for the minibinders.
Local resolution estimation, filtering, and sharpening were carried out using CryoSPARC.
Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143
criterion and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by
high-resolution noise substitution.

(conserved) and red those of high entropy (not conserved). (C) and (D) Heat maps representing
RBD-binding enrichment values for single mutations in the design model core (left) and the

beneficial mutations in red. The depletion of most substitutions in both the binding site and the
core suggest that the design models are largely correct, while the enriched substitutions
suggest routes to improving affinity. Full SSM maps over all positions for all eight de novo
designs are provided in Fig S5.

Figure S9 | CryoEM data processing and validation of the SARS-CoV-2 structure in
complex with LCB1. A-B. Representative electron micrograph (A) and 2D class averages (B)
of SARS-CoV-2 S in complex with LCB1 embedded in vitreous ice. Scale bar: 400Å. C. Goldstandard Fourier shell correlation curves for the LCB1-bound trimer (black solid line) and locally
refined RBD/LCB1 (grey solid line). The 0.143 cutoff is indicated by horizontal dashed lines. DE. Local resolution maps calculated using cryoSPARC for LCB1/S (D) and the locally refined
RBD/LCB1 region (E). F. Zoomed-in view of the interface between LCB1 (magenta) and the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (cyan) with the corresponding region of density shown as blue mesh.

Figure S10 | The CryoEM structure of LCB1 matches de novo designed model with
atomic accuracy. The computational model (silver grey) of LCB1/RBD complex is overlaid with
its CryoEM structure (cyan for RBD and pink for LCB1). Interface interaction details are shown
from 4 different views (A-D). Polar interactions are highlighted as dashed lines in orange for the
CryoEM structure and in yellow for the design model. Representative residue indices are
labeled according to the PDB 6M0J.
