Abstract
In 2020 the world faced the pandemic of COVID-19 - severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a
new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create
molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can
produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs
are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including
immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition,
we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light
and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to
establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2
proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to
have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover,
as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect
SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.

Introduction
At the beginning of 2020 the world faced an outbreak of COVID-19 - severe acute respiratory
syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. [1, 2]. More than 20 million people were infected
during the first 8 months of the pandemic. To slow down the spread of the disease WHO put significant
effort into supporting scientific research and the development of diagnostics, vaccines and medications
against COVID-19 [3], multiple platforms were established to monitor real time distribution of the
disease all over the world [4].
Phylogenetic analysis has attributed SARS-CoV-2 to the genus of Betacoronavirus in the
Coronaviridae family [5, 6]. Despite the name and the genetical similarity, SARS-CoV-2 is not a direct
descendant of previously described SARS-CoV virus. Rather it has independently originated during
the evolution [7]. Growing number of full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have revealed multiple
mutations and deletions in coding and non-coding regions of the virus [8]. However, SARS-CoV-2
has a relatively low mutation rate due to high accuracy of the enzymes involved in virus replication
[9].
The first step of coronavirus entry into the cell is its interaction with the surface receptors of
the host. These receptors include angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 [10-12] and CD26 for MERS-CoV [13]. Spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for the
interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2. This protein contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) that
interacts with the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 with Kd of 14.7 nM [14-16]. Cryogenic
electron microscopy has revealed a molecular structure of АСЕ2*RBD protein complex [14, 15]. Due
to its’ important role and a unique structure, RBD is considered as one of the main targets for the
development of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the mentioned above, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains peptide sequences that
may bind to MHC and serve as an effective epitope for the generation of antibodies [17]. It was
previously shown that S and N proteins of SARS-CoV induce prominent and prolonged T-cell immune

responses [18], which is consistent with recent observation for SARS-CoV-2 [19]. With its currently
evolving role S protein might serve as a promising antigen for the development of vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2 [20]. To this date, more than 20 vaccines based on the S protein are undergoing clinical
trials [21].
Besides the vaccines, development of diagnostics is critically important to stop the spreading
of COVID-19. Majority of tests for SARS-CoV-2 are being performed using reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on swabs from the nasopharynx or upper respiratory tract.
Additionally, computed tomography of the chest is used to confirm the diagnosis, but its results are
nonspecific and can often coincide with other diseases, therefore the diagnostic value of this method
is limited [22, 23]. Serological tests of the immune response of patients are also important as presence
of specific antibodies allows to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 in the society and identify
people who can potentially be immune to the infection. It was also proposed to use an immunoassay
to evaluate the response to the vaccination [24, 25]. Although the presence of neutralizing antibodies
can only be confirmed by specific tests using virus-like particles [26], high titers of IgG detected by
immunoassay have been shown to positively correlate with the amount of neutralizing antibodies. To
avoid the emergence of virus resistance to the antibodies, administration of cocktails containing
multiple therapeutic antibodies was proposed as a treatment strategy [27, 28].
Currently the manufacturing of antibodies shares one of the leading places on the marked
together with the production of vaccines [29]. The number of mAbs based drugs approved for the clinic
is growing every year. In addition to human or humanized neutralizing antibodies proposed as a "magic
bullet" for the treatment of COVID-19 [30], there is now a high variety of antibodies produced in
different species against all proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies cannot be directly used to
treat patients with COVID-19, but they serve as an important tool for both basic scientific research and
for the development of vaccines and diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, none of these

antibodies were developed in the Russian Federation. However, during the pandemic it is crucial to
have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19.
In the present study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that produces mAbs
against RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We also performed extensive characterization of the obtained
mAbs and describe their usage for various applications.

Experimental procedures
Plasmid Construction
The DNA fragment encoding RBD of SARS-CoV2 was amplified by PCR using primers S2_for (AAA
AGC TAG CAA TGG CAC GAT AAC TGA CGC) and S2_rev (AAT TAA GCT TAA ACA CAT
TTG ACC CAG TTG AGT A) from pTwist-EF1a-nCoV-2019-S-2xStrep plasmid kindly provided by
Dr. Nevan J. Krogan [31]. Resulting DNA fragment was cloned into NheI/HindIII sites of pET28a+
plasmid (Novagen) to generate pET28-S plasmid. The absence of unwanted mutations in the inserts
and vector-insert boundaries was verified by sequencing.
Recombinant protein expression and purification
To produce RBD fragment of S protein in bacterial cells BL21 (DE3) Codone+ RIL E. coli cells
(Agilent) were transformed with pET28-S plasmid. Bacteria were incubated at 37oC on shaker until
OD600 reached 0.7. Next, IPTG was added to a final concentration 1mM and bacteria were incubated
for an additional 4 hours at 37oC. 200 ml media with bacteria were centrifuged for 15 min, 5000 g at
4oC and the pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of lysis buffer B (200 mM NaCl, 100 mМ NaH2PO4, 10
mМ Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 8 M Urea, 0.5 mM DTT) and incubated for 1,5 hours at room temperature. Next,
solution was centrifuged for 15 min, 20000 g at 4oC and supernatant was incubated with 2 ml of NiNTA resin for 1 hour under a constant agitation. Suspension was transferred to a column and washed
with 20 ml of buffer B and 10 ml of buffer C (same as buffer B but рН 6.3). Bounded proteins were
eluted with buffer D (buffer C with 250 mM of imidazole) and dialyzed overnight against PBS with

1mM DTT. The purity of obtained protein was assessed by electrophoresis and subsequent Coomassie
Blue staining. RBD fragment of S protein purified from HEK293 cells was kindly provided by Vassili
N. Lazarev from the Center for Precision Genome Editing and Genetic Technologies for Biomedicine,
Federal Research and Clinical Center of Physical-Chemical Medicine of Federal Medical Biological
Agency.
Cell Culture
HEK293 and HT1080 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM Na-pyruvate and
penicillin-streptomycin mixture (100μg/ml). Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine LTX
reagent (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells were stained or
injected into mice 48 hours after transfection. X63 myeloma and hybridoma cells were grown in
DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) FBS, GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher), 1mM Napyruvate and penicillin-streptomycin mixture (100μg/ml). HAT or HT supplements (Sigma) were
added at different time points after fusion as described previously [32].
Mice immunization and hybridoma fusion
5 weeks old BALB/c mice were immunized according to the standard protocol [32] with several
modifications. First immunization was performed intraperitoneally with 200μg of RBD resuspended
in 150μl of PBS and mixed with 150μl of either Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) or Freund’s
incomplete adjuvant (FIA) (Thermo Fisher). Two weeks later mice were intraperitoneally injected with
200μg of RBD resuspended in 150μl of PBS and mixed with 150μl FIA. 6 days later blood from the
tail vein was collected to perform ELISA and IF staining. At days 28, 29 and 30 after first
immunization mice were subcutaneously injected with 2*106 HEK293 cells transfected with pTwistEF1a-nCoV-2019-S-2xStrep plasmid. At day 40 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100μg of
RBD resuspended in 100μl of PBS and 4 days later mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were isolated
and subsequently fused with X63 myeloma cells according to the standard protocol [32]. All animal

experiments were carried out under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
approved protocol according to NIH guidelines.
Production of ascites
Ascites were prepared to obtain large quantities of mAbs [32]. Briefly, mice were intraperitoneally
injected with 200μl of FIA. Five days later, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2.5*106 of
hybridoma cells in 150μl of PBS. After 12 days, mice were sacrificed and ascitic fluid was harvested
from the intraperitoneal cavity and centrifuged at 20 000g at 4 °C for 15 min.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed as described previously [33]. Briefly,
0.5 μg of RBD isolated from E. coli; RBD isolated from or HEK293 cells or 0.5 μg of a control protein
isolated from E. coli were immobilized on wells of 96 well EIA plate (Corning). After blocking with
1% BSA in TBST (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20) wells were incubated with
culture medium from hybridoma cells diluted 1:1 in TBST; mouse serum diluted 1:700 in TBST; or
ascitic fluid diluted in TBST. After washing with TBST wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) (1:10000 dilution in TBST) and developed with 1Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting (WB) was performed as described previously [34]. Briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, Protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 18 000g, 4oC for 10 min.
Supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, cells were lysed by boiling at 100°C for 10
minutes in 0.5% SDS and subsequently used for deglycosylation and SDS-PAGE. After
electrophoreses proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and incubated overnight with culture
medium from hybridoma cells diluted 1:1 in TBST. After washing membrane was incubated with
HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) (1:4000 dilution in TBST with 5%

nonfat dry milk). Membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent
substrate (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed on ImageQuant LAS 500 imager (GE Healthcare).
Deglycosylation
Deglycosylation of S protein from the lysate of HEK293 cells transfected with pTwist-EF1a-nCoV2019-S-2xStrep plasmid was performed as described previously [35] using PNGase F (New England
Biolabs).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
HT1080 cells were plated in wells of Lab-Tek II chamber and co-transfected with pTwist-EF1a-nCoV2019-S-2xStrep and pTagGFP2-C (Evrogen) plasmids. Two days after transfection cells were washed
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.
Cells were washed 2 times with PBS and incubated with culture medium from hybridoma cells diluted
1:1 in PBS or with mouse serum diluted 1:700 in PBS. After 5 washes with PBS cells were incubated
with AlexaFluor555-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) (1:500 dilution in
PBS) and subsequently stained with DAPI. Images were captured with a DIAPHOT 300 fluorescent
microscope (Nikon).
Generation of SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus particles
HEK293FT cells in T75 flask were cotransfected with 6 μg of pTwist-EF1a-nCoV-2019-S-2xStrep
plasmid, 9 μg of psPAX2 plasmid and 12 μg of pCDH‐GFP‐IRES‐Puro plasmid [36]. Next day culture
media was changes and 72 hours later media with viruses was collected and filtered through 0.4 μm
filter. Pseudoviruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation as described previously [37].
Analysis of infection efficiency
HT1080 cells were plated in wells of 24 well plate to 50% confluence. 180 μl of fresh media, 180 μl
of hybridoma media (with or without Abs) and 40 μl of virus suspension were added to each well. 4
days later cells were extensively washed with PBS and genomic DNA was isolated using Lira reagent
(Biolabmix) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Obtained DNA was used for real-time PCR

with primers for 18S (GGC CCT GTA ATT GGA ATG AGT C and CCA AGA TCC AAC TAC GAG
CTT) and GFP (TGG TGA CCA CCC TCT GCT AC and GGC GCT CTT GAA GAA GTC GT).
PCR was performed on LightCycler 96 Instrument (Roche) as described previously [36].
Antibody sequencing
Sequencing of mRNAs encoding heavy and light chains of antibodies was performed using 5′ SMART
RACE method as described previously [38] with slight modifications. First strand of cDNA was
synthesized using Mint kit (Evrogen) with primers for k-chain (TTG TCG TTC ACT GCC ATC AAT
C), λ-chain (GGG GTA CCA TCT ACC TTC CAG), and heavy-chain (CTG GAC AGG GAT CCA
GAG TTC CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, cDNA encoding immunoglobulins
was amplified by conventional PCR using M1 forward primer (AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC
AGA GT) and revers primers specific for k-chain (ACA TTG ATG TCT TTG GGG TAG AAG), λchain (ATC GTA CAC ACC AGT GTG GC), and heavy-chain (GGG ATC CAG AGT TCC AGG
TC). Obtained DNA was purified and cloned into pKAN-T (Evrogen) vector that was subsequently
sequenced. At least 3 different clones were sequenced for each chain of the antibodies.
Immunoglobulin sequences were analyzed using IgBLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/),
BLASTn (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE) and SignalP5.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) software.

Results
Mice immunization with S protein of SARS-CoV2. Animal immunization is the first step in the
development of mouse mAbs. There are multiple proposed protocols to create antibodies against
different types of proteins and each of them has certain benefits and drawbacks. Thus, immunization
with DNA vectors or cells overexpressing target protein on their surface allows production of
antibodies against native protein which has correct folding and proper post-translational modifications
[39, 40]. On the other hand, immunization with synthetic peptides or recombinant protein fragments

enables the development of antibodies specific for a certain part of amino acid sequence without
contamination of antibodies raised against oligosaccharides decorating the protein [41]. In the current
study, we applied combined protocol and first immunized animals with recombinant RBD fragment
purified from E. coli and next injected mice with cells overexpressing full length S protein.
On the first step, we expressed and isolated RBD of S protein from E. coli under denaturing
conditions (Fig. 1A). Despite multiple attempts, we were unable to design a refolding protocol that
could allow us to obtain a soluble protein in a buffer suitable for immunization. Therefore, we injected
mice with a suspension of insoluble protein in PBS. The schematic representation of immunization
schedule is shown on figure 1B. First immunization was performed with recombinant protein mixed
at a 1:1 ratio with either Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) or Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA).
Interestingly, FIA allowed to obtain a significantly higher titer of specific antibodies as opposed to
FCA (Fig. 1C). This result indicates that insoluble RBD is highly immunogenic and does not require
any stimulating additives for the development of immune response. Similar data were obtained
previously during animal immunization with the surface protein of the Zika virus [41].
Next, Immunofluorescence staining (IF) of cells overexpressing full length S protein with mice
serum demonstrated that antibodies raised against insoluble RBD could detect native S protein (Fig.
1D). Therefore, both insoluble RBD and full length S protein expressed on the surface of mammalian
cells have common epitopes indicating that these proteins could be used for the production and
selection of antibodies against SARS-CoV2.

Selection of hybridoma cells secreting mAbs against S protein of SARS-CoV2. 44 days after the first
immunization splenocytes were purified from the mice and subsequently fused with X63 myeloma
cells. After the fusion cells were seeded on 20 96-wells plates and 3 weeks later 120 hybridoma
monoclones were obtained. mAbs produced by these clones were tested by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against RBD purified from HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). Primary screening

with the protein that was purified from the different sources (compared to the protein used for
immunization) allowed us to exclude clones that produced antibodies against various contaminants
that inevitably present in the samples used for immunization. It is important to note that RBD expressed
in HEK293 cells presumably has glycosylation pattern which is similar to that of native S protein and
therefore mAbs interacting with RBD from HEK293 most likely could interact with full length S.
Total of fourteen hybridomas that demonstrated the strongest immunoreactivity against RBD
were chosen for further analysis. We performed immunoblotting (WB) with the culture medium from
our clones to detect S protein in the lysates of human cells that were transfected with plasmids encoding
full length S protein or GFP as a control. Representative WBs are shown on figure 2B. Interestingly,
two clones which had highest immunoreactivity in ELISA experiment failed to detect S protein on
WB. Therefore, mAbs produced by these cells are probably nonspecific. Another important
observation is that most of the tested mAbs were able to detect endogenous human protein with
molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa. It is possible that this protein may have a common epitope
with RBD of S protein from SARS-CoV2.

Establishment of monoclones producing antibodies against S protein of SARS-CoV2. It is well
known that hybridoma cells are characterized by the high degree of genetical instability during the first
passages. Thus, descendants of a single hybridoma cell will most likely produce different antibodies
at early time points after fusion [42]. Therefore, we chose hybridoma #11 which showed highest
immunoreactivity against full length S protein (Fig. 2B) and subcloned these cells to obtain true
monoclones. Culture media from 17 subclones of hybridoma #11 were tested by ELISA against RBD
purified from E. coli, RBD purified from HEK293, and control protein purified from E. coli (Fig. 3A).
Based on our results, we picked 3 subclones for further analysis. Subsequent WB analysis
demonstrated that all monoclones produce mAbs with higher specificity compared to the original
hybridoma #11 (Fig. 3B). It is interesting to note that mAbs from monoclone #11/13 which showed

highest signal against RBD purified from E. coli but not against RBD purified from HEK293 (Fig.
3A) were only able to detect endogenous 60 kDa human protein and showed weak binding to full
length S protein. Therefore, it is possible that recombinant insoluble RBD has high epitope similarity
to the undetermined endogenous protein.

Characterization of mAbs against S protein of SARS-CoV2. Based on our results (Fig. 3) we chose
mAbs produced by monoclone #11/9 for further characterization. First, we used immunofluorescence
staining to test if these mAbs were able to bind to native nondenatured S protein. Images on figure 4A
shows that mAbs #11/9 specifically stain human cells that overexpress S protein and have little or no
binding to the neighboring nontransfected cells. Therefore, mAbs #11/9 were able to detect RBD
fragment in ELISA experiment; full length denatured S protein in WB; and full length native S protein
on a cell surface as demonstrated by IF microscopy.
It was previously shown that RBD undergoes extensive glycosylation in human cells [43].
Therefore, we aimed to test if glycosylation affects binding of mAbs #11/9 to the S protein. To this
end, we treated lysate of cells overexpressing S protein with deglycosylating enzyme PNGase F.
Figure 4B demonstrates that deglycosylation decreases molecular weight of S protein by at least 30
kDa, however it has no effect on the intensity of staining with mAbs #11/9. Thus, it is reasonable to
conclude that the region of S protein that interacts with mAbs #11/9 is not masked by glycoside groups
of the protein.
RBD plays the key role in the virus infection by interacting with the surface protein ACE2.
Hence antibodies against RBD can effectively block infection of human cells with SARS-CoV2 [26].
To test the effect of mAbs #11/9 on the infection rate, we obtained SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus particles
that encode GFP. We used these particles to transduce HT1080 cells which were previously shown to
be highly susceptible for the infection with SARS-CoV [44]. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach
more than 5% transduction efficiency. Therefore, to quantify the effect of mAbs #11/9 on the infection

rate, we determined the level of DNA encoding GFP that was incorporated into the genome of HT1080
cells after the transduction with pseudoviruses. Our results demonstrate that the presence of mAbs
#11/9 decreases the infection rate of SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus particles by at least two folds (Fig. 4C).
Finally, we aimed to produce mAbs #11/9 in higher quantities and test how these mAbs will
recognize S protein when used in the different concentrations. For this reason, we injected two mice
with corresponding hybridoma cells and 12 days later both animals formed ascites. In total 6 ml of
ascitic fluid was collected. We used this ascites for serial dilution ELISA with RBD purified from E.
coli. According to our data, mAbs #11/9 from ascites were able to detect recombinant RBD but not a
control protein in as high as 1:1000 000 dilution (Fig. 4D), indicating an efficient binding of the
antibodies to the antigen.

Identification of amino acid sequences of mAbs #11/9. During last few decades genetically modified
antibodies (humanized antibodies, single-domain antibody and etc.) were proven to be highly effective
for various therapeutic and diagnostic applications [45]. One of the techniques for the production of
such antibodies is based on the cloning of the previously identified variable domain sequences from
mAbs into the artificially designed vectors encoding constant regions of the antibodies. Therefore, we
aimed to determine the amino acid sequence of mAbs #11/9 which it responsible for the binding to S
protein. For this reason, we amplified cDNA encoding heavy and light chains of mAbs by 5′ SMART
RACE method. Using primers specific to k or λ chains we demonstrated that mAbs #11/9 contains
only k light chain (Fig. 5A). Sequencing of PCR products revealed the nucleotide and amino acid
sequence of variable domains of mAbs #11/9 (Fig. 5B). Bioinformatic analysis showed that both light
and heavy chains do not contain in frame stop codons, have the correct position of the conserved amino
acids and that the corresponding nucleotide sequences have not been published previously. Therefore,
the obtained sequences most likely represent viable antibodies originating from murine splenocytes

but not abortive rearrangement products which theoretically could appear from X63 myeloma cells
that were used for fusion.

Discussion
In this study we describe the development of mAbs against RBD fragment of SARS-CoV2 S protein.
The expression and purification of the antigen is often the most challenging step of the mAbs
production technique. In case of proteins expressed in E. coli the optimization of refolding conditions
may frequently represents a major problem and time consuming step. On the other hand, if protein is
expressed in mammalian cells it might be difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of the material for
animal injection. Here we utilized immunization of mice with insoluble protein mixed with FIA and
subsequent reimmunization with cells overexpressing target protein. The main advantage of this
protocol is the absence of steps that may require extensive optimization. The only necessary materials
are the recombinant protein fragment expressed in E. coli, and the plasmid encoding full length protein.
Both components can be easily obtained using standard well established methods. Therefore, we
believe that the protocol applied in this study might be useful for the rapid development of mAbs
against viral proteins. It became clear during the pandemic of COVID19 that such necessity may
indeed arise in the future.
Although the aim of this study was to create mAbs to S protein, we have also obtained a set of
data that might be useful for the development of the vaccines against COVID19. Thus, we
demonstrated that two injections of RBD mixed with FIA might be sufficient for the emerging of
antibodies that can target full length native S protein. On the other hand, it might be worth to note that
most of the mAbs that were established during this study could also bind to endogenous protein from
human cells. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate possible cross reactivity of antibodies
that arise against SARS-CoV2 S protein.

Another interesting observation could be made during comparison of WBs on figures 3B and
4B. Latter one has much stronger band that corresponds to S protein. Same cells were used for both
WBs, however for figures 4B we performed cell lysis by boiling in SDS solution, while for WB on
figures 3B cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer. Therefore, the discrepancy in WBs might be
attributed to the fact that S protein is tightly anchored to the cell membrane and therefore harsh
conditions are required for its’ efficient extraction, while a standard lysis protocol leaves most of S
protein in the pellet that contains insoluble cell fragments.
Finally, it is important to note, that for rigorous characterization of the mAbs obtained in this
study further experiments are needed. Thus, here we only used culture medium from hybridoma cells
or ascitic fluid in which the exact concentration of mAbs was not determined. If the mAbs developed
here prove to be useful, it will be important to repeat some of the experiments with purified antibodies
taken at various concentrations. This will allow to determine the optimal concentration of mAbs for
each application and to calculate the Kd of antibody-antigen binding. Also it will be interesting to
repeat experiment with inhibition of cell infection using different experimental models and cell lines.
However, we believe that the most useful result of the current study is, firstly, the hybridoma cells that
are able to produce mAbs against SARS-CoV2 in any quantity needed and, secondly, the amino acid
sequence of mAbs against RBD. Knowledge of these sequence might be useful for the development
of the cocktails of neutralizing antibodies against COVID19.
In summary, we developed novel mAbs that might serve as an important tool for the scientific
research of SARS-CoV2 and also could help in the establishing of diagnostic and treatment methods
for COVID-19 patients. Significant advantage of these mAbs is the presence of corresponding
hybridoma cells which could produce these antibodies in nearly any quantity with comparatively little
costs.

transfected with plasmid encoding full length S protein and lysed by boiling in SDS. Lysate was
incubated in a presence or absence of PNGase F. Membrane was stained with mAbs #11/9. С, Relative
incorporation level of GFP gene into the genome of HT1080 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus particles encoding GFP. Infection was performed in presence or absence of culture
medium from #11/9 hybridoma cells. D, Serial dilution ELISA showing reactivity of ascites formed
by monoclone #11/9 against RBD (red) or control protein (blue) purified from E. coli. **p < 0.01.
