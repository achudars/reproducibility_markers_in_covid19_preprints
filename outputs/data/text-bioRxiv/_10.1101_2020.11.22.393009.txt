ABSTRACT
Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed more
than 1.5 million lives worldwide and counting. As per the GISAID database, the genomics of
SARS-CoV2 is extensively studied with more than 500 genome submissions per day. Out of
several hotspot mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, researchers have focused a lot on
missense variants but the least work is done on the UTRs. One of the most frequent 5’ UTR
variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the C241T with a global frequency of more than 0.9.
In the present study, the effect of the C241T mutation has been studied with respect to change
in RNA structure and its interaction with the host replication factors MADP1 Zinc finger
CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (hnRNP1). The results obtained from molecular
docking and molecular dynamics simulation indicated weaker interaction of C241T mutant
stem loops with host transcription factor MADP1 indicating reduced replication efficiency.
The results are also correlated with increased recovery rates and decreased death rates of
global SARS-CoV-2 cases.

INTRODUCTION
According to WHO, COVID19 pandemic has affected over 40 million individuals from over
218 countries, areas and territories and has cost 1.1 million lives (1). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to
the Coronaviridae family, is a ssRNA virus that mostly causes respiratory infections. This
family comprises the lethal viruses like SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2.
During a viral infection, there is a critical game of host-pathogen interaction, wherein either
wants to survive and hence both pathogen and host tend to develop mechanisms for their
existence. A majority of viruses contain their genome replication through 5’cap or have some
secondary structures of RNA forming internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) to recruit host

replication factors. For viral replication, the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) makes a substantial
contribution by providing important gear to regulate various host replication initiation factors
in the case of RNA containing viruses, the majority in picornaviruses (2). Another
mechanism includes non-AUG (Methionine) initiation where a particular virus target eIF2
inhibits host cell protein synthesis and lastly, to overcome the stress of certain antigenic
peptides, few viruses use CUG (Leucine) initiation mode (3). Some viruses use another
variant for translation initiation like the shutoff mechanism, which is an eIF2 independent
mechanism, where viruses use the formation of downstream loop helix after initiation codon
for efficient translation of viral mRNA (4). These are major mechanisms by which viruses
occupy the host factors to use them for their own replication and translation. To prevent
infection of viruses, these targets can thus to be efficient candidates to shut down the viral
translation machinery (5). SARS-CoV-2 is likely to perform its replication through a 5’ capdependent mechanism (6). In SARS-CoV-2, an important helicase protein Nsp13 might be
involved in the 5’ cap-dependent mechanism of viral replication. Nsp13 has RNA50-NTPase
activity mediated by the NTPase active site of the nsp13-associated helicase domain (7) (8).
Host factors involved in coronavirus proliferation include Annexin A2, which regulates IBV
(immune bronchitis virus) frameshifting (9), hnRNP1 which binds with high affinity at MHV
(-) strand of the leader sequence of RNA, PAPBs binds at poly-A tract of 3’UTR of BCov,
TBV and TEGV (10) (11) (12), MADP1 Zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1
binds at stem-loops structures at 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and IBV (13). The involvement of
these factors is proven by wet-lab experiments involving in vitro pull-down assay and gene
expression studies (14) (15).
SARS-CoV-2 after entry in the human host through ACE2 receptors enters the lung epithelial
cells and injects its RNA into the host cytoplasm (16) (17). At the initial stage of infection,
full-length negative-sense RNA copies are generated, which further act as a template for the
synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (18). During the discontinuous replication process
of the viral genome, RNA stem-loop structures SL1, SL2, TLR-S play an important role by
interacting with host RNA binding proteins like Zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding
motif 1 MADP1. This interaction plays important role in viral replication and translation (14)
(19) (20) (13). Novel SARS-CoV-2 seems to have stem-loop structures in 5’ UTR sequence
and the translation is occurring through a cap-dependent fashion (21) (22) (23). A majority of
them are reported as SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4A, and SL5. (24), (25), (26). SL1 contains a
bipartite sequence that is possibly involved in the fine-tuning of viral RNA interaction with
host protein. SL2 contains a tremendously conserved loop sequence of 5’-CUUCU (N)-3’
among most of the coronavirus species which is likely to form a tetra loop-like structure (26)
(27). SL3 is eminently conserved among the group of gamma and beta coronavirus. SL3
comprises TRS-L (transcription regulating sequence) 5’-UCUCAA-3’, which is exposed in
the core region of SL3 and meant to be highly involved in virus replication and transcription
(22). SL4 is one of the major hairpin loops containing domain among the coronaviruses;
located downstream to the TRS-L sequence and prone to mutation. Even a single or two SNP
in SL-4 can change the frame of the sequence and be prone to abolish viral replication (25)
(24) (26).
The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is around 29-31 kb and more than 151K whole
genome sequences have been deposited in GISAID by researchers across the globe. Top
variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome include high-frequency variants including C241T,
C1059T, C3037T, C14408T, A23403G, G25563T and G28883C from which C241T variant
had a 99% frequency with 0.505 entropy by October, 2020 (28). Though lot of research is
published pertaining to the missense variants of the genome, to the best of our knowledge, no

detailed reports on effect of the 5’ UTR variant C241T on host factor binding are available
(29).
In this article, molecular docking and MD simulation studies were performed using the wild
type (T) and mutant (C) sequences from 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 with host factor MADP1
and hnRNP1. Further, the wild type and mutant RNA-Protein complexes were analyzed for
their stability by deciphering H-bonds formations, binding energy using MMGBSA,
dynamics cross-correlation matrix and Principal Component Analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
RNA secondary structure prediction
FASTA format sequence of 5’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 from RFAM database with id RF03117
was used for the prediction of the secondary structure of wild type sequence and mutant
sequence was generated using the same sequence by replacing C241 with T. RNA secondary
and tertiary structure prediction is a very crucial thing to perform during in silico experiments
to reach accurate conclusions. Strains of various SARS CoV-2 already have reported a
presence of various stem-loops structure and bulges which is addressed in RFAM database;
we took FASTA format sequence (around 300 base pairs) from RFAM id RF03117 for
studying 5’ UTR sequences of beta coronaviruses (30).
RNA secondary and ternary structures were generated in RNA composer that uses the RNA
FRABASE dictionary with the CHARM force field for generating effective minimized
energy RNA structures (31). One plus advantage of RNA composers is the ease of predicting
the ternary structures of long RNA sequences, which is a limitation of many RNA structure
prediction software. The effect of single nucleotide variation in base-pairing probabilities was
checked in mutaRNA (32). Final confirmation of folded RNA structure was confirmed in the
X3DNA-DSSR Linux-based operating system which gives accurate root mean square
deviation (RMSD) between predicted and experimentally verified (33).
Prediction of RNA-protein binding sites
MADP1 binds to SL1 of SARS-cov2, which is selected as a protein binding site for the
5’UTR region. It is also known that TRS-L is involved in binding with hnRNP1 sequence 5’
CGGCUGC 3’, which was selected as a protein binding sequence (14) (23). Prediction of
RNA residues binding to protein was also done by RNApin web server (34), where these sites
are also falling in the protein binding region.
Docking of protein-RNA complexes
In HADDOCK, molecular docking of host factors and RNA was performed (35) (36).
Haddock is a popular docking program that performs docking using a data-driven approach.
Docking encompasses three stages: rigid-body docking, semi-flexible refinement, and water
refinement. In stage one for the docking of protein and RNA in their bound conformation, a
total of 1000 structures were generated. Systematic sampling of 180 rotated solutions was
used in the rigid-body docking stage to minimize the occurrence of false positives. The best
20% structures generated from the rigid-body docking stage were used in the second stage of
semi-flexible refinement. The second stage further performs three-step refinement, rigid body
torsion angle dynamics, and simulated annealing stage at different MD steps. In the final
simulated annealing stage where 1000MD steps were performed from 300K to 50K with 2 fs
time steps. In the final stage, both the side chain and backbone of protein residues at interface
and RNA can move except the terminal base of RNA. This final stage consists of a gentle
refinement (100 MD heating steps at 100, 200, and 300 K followed by 750 sampling steps at

300 K and 500 MD cooling steps at 300, 200, and 100 K all with 2 fs time steps) in an 8 Å
shell of TIP3P water molecules (36). Docking of protein-RNA complexes were also
performed in various servers like PATCHDOCK (37) (Schneidman-duhovny, Inbar,
Nussinov, & Wolfson, 2005), NPDOCK (38), and HDOCK (39) to compare the docking
score between two structures.
Molecular dynamics simulation
Molecular dynamics simulation of Protein-RNA complexes was performed in Desmond
implemented in Schrodinger (40) (41). The selected protein-RNA complexes were first
immersed into a TIP3 water box, extending 10 Å beyond any of the complex’s atoms.
Counter ions (Na+, and Cl- ions) were added to neutralize charges. Salt concentration was set
to 0.15 M sodium, and chloride ions to approximate physiological condition. The MD was
performed in the NPT ensemble at a temperature of 300 K and 1.63 bar pressure over 20 ns
with recording intervals of 1.2 ps for energy and 20 ps for trajectory. Simulations were run
with the OPLS-3e force field compatible for Protein and nucleic acids. Plots and figures were
generated in Pymol DeLano, W. L. 2009.
Binding energy for protein RNA complex is calculated using the following equations
Binding energy components for four protein RNA complexes were calculated using PRIME
module in Schrodinger using thermal_mmgbsa.py and residue-wise decomposition using
breakdown_mmgbsa_by_resdiue.py script. The binding energy was calculated for a total of
1000 frames of the MD trajectory starting from the 1th ns until the end of the trajectory at the
100th ns. MMGBSA was calculated using the following equation.
ΔGBind= ΔGSA + ΔGSolv + ΔEMM
ΔGSA is the difference in the surface area energies for the protein – RNA complex and the
sum of the surface area energies in the protein and RNA. ΔEMM is the difference in the
minimized energies between the protein–RNA complexes. ΔGSolv is the difference in the
GBSA solvation energy of the protein–RNA complex and the sum of the solvation energies
for the protein and RNA. ΔGSA is the difference in the surface area energies for the complex
and sum of the surface area energies in the protein and RNA (15).
Principal component analysis
A vivid graphical presentation of dominant correlated motions of atoms present in the
protein-RNA complex is obtained by the covariance matrix of the Cartesian coordinate data
set. To generate covariance matrix of elements Cij for coordinates i and j is given by bellow
mentioned
formula.
Here, ri and rj were Cartesian coordinates of ith and jth Cα atoms, 〈ri〉 and 〈rj〉 stood for the
time average over all the configurations derived from the molecular dynamics simulation.
This analysis was performed using the Bio3D library as implemented in R (42) (43) (44) (45).
Dynamics cross-correlation
Cross-correlation Matrix was used to study detailed insights regarding to effect of C241T
mutation on Protein-RNA complex dynamics by analyzing how atomic displacements were
coupled. A cross-correlation coefficient Cij was calculated from Cα atoms by the following
equation.

In this equation, Δri and Δrj are the displacements from the mean position of the ith and jth
residues (or atoms), respectively. The angular brackets “〈 〉” represents the time average of
the entire trajectory. The value of Cij is from -1 to 1. The positive value means positively
correlated motion (moving in the same direction) indicated in cyan and the negative value
represents negatively correlated motion (moving in the opposite direction) indicated in
magenta. The DCCM analysis is carried out using the Bio3D packages of R (42) (43) (44)
(45).
RESULTS & DISCUSSION
Viral replication is highly dependent on the host factors, especially the transcription factors in
the case of RNA viruses. Novel SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA virus from the family
Coronaviridae is deploying 5’ CAP-dependent discontinuous replication within the human
host (24, 46). As indicated in the previous studies in SARS infection, MADP1 from the Zinc
finger protein motif 1 plays a very crucial role in deciding the replication efficiency within
host cells (13). From hnRNP family, hnRNPA-1 is highly studied concerning SARS-CoV-2,
having multiple roles in viral proliferation like RNA replication, transcription, export, import,
and translation. hnRPA-1 uses RGG (Arginine-glycine-glycine) for RNA binding; it also
binds with viral nucleocapsid protein (N) (47). While hnRNP1 is binding to the TLRS
sequence (Pyrimidine rich) of most the coronaviruses like TGEV CoV and MHV (23), its
involvement with respect to SARS CoV is yet be studied. In the present study, molecular
dynamics and interaction of two human transcription factors MADP1 and hnRNP1 were
studied with a most common 5’ UTR mutation C241T in the viral genome. MADP1 and
hnRNP1 shares highly structural similarities, where an extra beta-sheet is found in hnRNP1
(Supplementary Figure S1). Due to similarities in tertiary structure and role of hnRNP1 in
binding at TLR-s of other coronaviruses leads us to incorporate this protein in our study with
respect to TLR sequence.
Structural difference in 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2
To initiate the same, sequences of the wild type and mutant (C241T) viral 5’ UTR sequences
were taken and secondary structures were generated (Supplementary Table S1). RNA
secondary structure which is predicted in dot-bracket format in X3-DNA Linux-based
software (33) was visualized in Varna-GUI and structural differences due to C241T were
interpreted. Representation of the variation in RNA structure due to SNP is elucidated in
Table 1. The topological difference in both RNA structures is shown in Supplementary
Figure S2. While structural features of RNA stem-loops are described in Figure 1. In mutant
RNA, change is observed in SL-4 (101G-111U to 101G-112), which further leads to a change
in the loop structure of SL4 (Figure 1). Change in SL4 also changes the folding; further
inducing difference in SL1, SL2, and SL3. RNA fold was used to obtain nucleotide residue
wise entropy and base pairing probability within residues (Supplementary Figure S3). Both
RNA sequences showed structural and folding differences within SL1, SL2, and TLR

sequences. To correlate these variations in sequence with the favorable binding of host
replication factors, Protein- RNA docking and binding energy was calculated to check the
effect of binding between both sequences of wild-type and (C241T) RNA. Studies have also
shown the presence of these stem-loop structures in SARS, hence the resultant structures
were taken to perform docking and MD simulation analysis (41).
Docking of host transcription factors with 5’UTR variants
MADP1 is known to bind at SL1 and SL2 of RNA with help of Nsp1 protein for viral
replication and transcription (13). Another protein hnRNP1 is known to bind at the TLR-S
sequence of IBV, TGEV, and MHV (23). Wet lab reports of MADP1 binding to 5’ UTR of
SARS-CoV were available but not for hnRNP1 (13). 5’UTR of SARS-Cov-2 is folded such
that SL1, SL2, SL3, and SL4 shared nearby folding, which may enhance the surface area for
binding of these proteins. Our major focus was on MADP1 mediated binding at the SL1 and
SL2 regions of both variants of the 5’ UTR region. In the majority of Coronaviridae family
viruses, hnRNP1 is known to bind at TLR-S sequence of 5’ UTR (11, 14). It was
hypothesized that hnRNP1 might also bind to TLR-S of SARS-CoV-2 for viral proliferation.
After docking studies, a change in binding was also observed for host factors with both RNA
sequences. The stability of host factors-RNA complexes was also analyzed to comment on
the affinity among both 5’ UTR variants.
Docking results for wild-type and mutant RNA with host factors protein from HADDOCK
depicted the change in the folding of stem-loop 1, 2 and 3 in tertiary structures of RNA
mediates difference in binding within all four complexes.
Concerning MADP1, a total of 117 structures in 8 cluster(s) were clustered in HADDOCK
for wild type complex representing 58.5 % of the water-refined models, while 119 structures
in 8 cluster(s), were generated for the mutant sequence (C241T) which represents 59.5 % of
the water-refined models.
For HNRNP1, HADDOCK clustered 107 structures in 13 cluster(s), which represents 53.5
% of the water-refined models generated for wild-type complex, while 92 structures
in 14 cluster(s), which represents 46.0 % of the water-refined models were generated for the
mutant complex.
Based on the docking score, wild-type RNA seems to have better binding and RMSD value
for MADP1 compared to the mutated (C241T) sequence (Table 2). The binding pose of
MADP1 with RNA structure is shown in Figure 2. For hnRNP1, no significant change was
observed for docking score and RMSD values. However, the average standard deviation
(negative Z score) among clusters of wild-type RNA with host factors indicates better
docking among complexes compared to the mutant (Table 2). Based on docking result,
electrostatic energy and Van der Waals energy favors the protein-RNA complex formation
while desolvation energy hinders the same.
As per the data analysis from GISAID and Nextstrain, the variant C241T emerged in early
2020 strains of SARS-CoV-2 and currently its most predominant variant in genomes reported
from world-over (28, 48). To further validate this finding, the molecular dynamics of mutant
and wild-type complexes were studied to find binding energy and stability.
Analysis of MD simulation
Molecular dynamics simulation was performed for variants of 5’ UTR with two different host
transcription factors MADP1 and hnRNP1 after docking in HADDOCK. Simulations of four
complexes were performed for 100ns because early dissociation of MADP1 with Mutant

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.22.393009; this version posted November 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

(C241U) was observed (Supplementary Video S1 & S2). Early dissociation in mutantMADP1 is one of the important factors to comment on the stability within both variants.
Narrowing of space within SL1 and SL3 affects the binding MADP1 drastically which may
lead to early dissociation. The major purpose of the Molecular dynamics simulation study is
to comment on the stability within the 5’UTR variant and protein complexes. Various graphs
captured during simulation events of both the wild type and variant in the simulation analysis
package of Schrodinger are described in Figures 4 & 5.
With respect to MADP1, RMSD (Root mean square deviation) of wild-type complex was
5.37nm while for mutant it was 5.19nm. In the case of wild-type RNA, for the first 20ns
trajectory was fluctuating but after 30ns system reached a plateau showing that the MADP1RNA complex had formed a stable transition structure. While the trajectory of the mutant
(C241U) complex was observed to be fluctuating and reaching a plateau after 60 ns (Figure
4A). RMSF (root mean square fluctuation) values of MADP1 and RNA from both complexes
were calculated. Figure 5 explains the MADP1 residual fluctuation in both complexes, where
amino acid residues from 1 to 60 show less fluctuation in wild type complex compared to the
mutant (C241T) complex. Less fluctuation in RMSF value indicates more interaction
between RNA-protein complexes (49, 50, 51) which is also evident here in the case of a wildtype complex.
HnRNP1 and RNA complexes were also analyzed with respect of stability. RMSD of the
wild-type complex is 1.45nm which is much lower compared to mutant complex 2.35nm
(Figure 4A). Overall residual fluctuation is shown in Figure 5C & 5D. Protein residues that
are binding to RNA’s TLR-S sequence have overall less fluctuation compared to non-bound
residues, among them wild-type hnRNP1 have lower fluctuation compared to mutant (Figure
5C-box A). TLR-S (U59-C66) of the wild-type complex has significantly lower fluctuation
compare to the mutant complex (Figure 5D).
For both host replication factors, wild-type complex seems to be more favorable for the
binding compare to the mutant complex. Further, Hydrogen bond formation was analyzed,
where again in wild-type complex hydrogen bond formation is higher compared to mutant
complex. Change in hydrogen bonds during different time intervals and occupancy within the
complex was analyzed.
Hydrogen bonds occupancy within complexes
To study the interaction of amino acids in Protein-RNA complexes, hydrogen bond analysis
of those amino acid residues interacting with RNA was analyzed. Protein and RNA
interaction with respect to hydrogen bond occupancy is shown in Supplementary Table S2.
C241T mutation leads to structural changes in the folding of RNA (Supplementary Figure
S2) which in turn affects the binding of MADP1 with SL1 sequence of 5’UTR and hnRNP1
with TLR sequence within SL3. H-bonds occupancy within 3Å distance cutoff and 20°
distance was calculated using VMD (52). Based on docking results and MD simulation,
hydrogen bonding was divided in two parts. Group 1 (named SL1) captured nucleotide
resides ranging from 7G to C42 (Supplementary Figures S4 – S7), Group 2 (named TLR-S)
contained 60U to 79A (Supplementary Figures S4 – S7). Hydrogen bond occupancy is shown
for group 1 and group 2 in Tables 2 & 3, as those residues are exclusively involved in viral
RNA replication using MADP1 and hnRNP1, respectively. RNA nucleotide residues
involved in hydrogen bonding with amino-acid residues of MADP1 were shown using Pymol
during different time intervals (0ns, 30ns, 60ns, and 100ns) of MD simulation. For group 1
(SL1) and group 2 (TLR-S), it is visible that the wild-type protein RNA complex is having
more hydrogen bonds interaction with greater occupancy than the mutant (C241T) complex.

Change in the tertiary structure of RNA leads to a drastic change in the binding of amino-acid
residues for both of the proteins. Widening of a gap within the Wild-type complex leads to
the binding of diverse MADP1 amino-acid residues with RNA, enhancing the stability
compared to only one amino acid binding to two nucleotides. For example, in case of
MADP1, a SL1 residue C32 is binding to Lys50-NZ in wild type complex while in mutant
(C241T) Lys50 is binding with U9 and C32. U9 of wild-type complex is binding with Asn30ND2, for mutant complex U10 is binding with the same amino acid (Supplementary Figure
S4B & S4E). Occupancy of hydrogen bonds also increases in such type of interaction which
is correlated with percentage occupancy results of Hydrogen bonds with MADP1 using VMD
and decreased in bond length.
Some hydrogen bonds existed for the only period of time, named dynamic hydrogen bonds,
while those that existed throughout the simulation are named as static hydrogen bonds. In
group 1 there is a major change in interacting amino acids within SL1 region. Although,
overall amino acid residues showed interactions were the same but change in position of
interaction was observed, which is favoring higher occupancy of hydrogen bonds within
wild-type complexes. Other interactions were also observed in wild-type complex, forming
higher occupancy hydrogen bonds with amino acid residue in Lys-50, Asp-53, and Arg55
with 39A, 42U, and 33C respectively forming static hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Figure
S5B & S5E, S6B & S6E). Lys-52 is the major amino acid favoring complex formation within
both complexes. In wild type complex, Lys-52 was having bonds with C33, C36, and C38
throughout the simulation. In the mutant, Lys-52 was having bonds with C33 and 34A
throughout the trajectory. Arg-48 seems to have bonds with 3A in the wild-type complex
while again C33 in the mutant complex. Wild-type complex seems to cover wild range of
nucleotides with different amino acids, which might make it more prone to efficient protein
RNA complex formation. Vast varieties of dynamics of hydrogen bonds formed during the
simulation are shown in the Supplementary Material.
Interesting results were observed when MADP1 is showing binding within TLR sequence in
both complexes. In the 3D folded structure of 5’UTR, TLR-S residues share a nearby position
with respect to SL1 and SL2. This unique interaction leads to one of the parameters to yet
study, weather MADP1 is interacting in SARS-CoV-2 TLR-S sequence for viral proliferation
or another factor is required for the same. At 100ns major change involved is in the mutant
complex where protein is getting dissociated from RNA, compared to wild type complex
(Supplementary Video S1 & S2). This can lead to the conclusion that the mutant complex is
having relatively less stable interaction with host factor MADP1 compared to the wild type.
Other hypothesized protein-RNA complex (hnRNP1) is analyzed for commenting on the
structural stability of RNA with respect to protein binding and interaction. It was surprising
for us that Hydrogen bond occupancy in wild-type complex is much higher compared to the
Mutant complex (Supplementary Table S3) shown in supplementary figures 8 and 9. Here
also the same thing is repeated with respect to MADP1, where numbers of nucleotide
residues binding to HNRNP1 were more in wild-type complex compared to the mutant.
Nucleotide residues 57A, 58U, 59C, 60U, 64C, 65U, 69A, 70A were binding in wild type
complex while 57A, 58U, 64C, 65U only binding in the mutant complex (Supplementary
figure S8 & S9). However, no dissociation among both HNRNP1 and RNA was observed at
100ns.
RMSD, RMSF, H-Bonds and binding energy in form of MMGBSA indicated weak
interaction of mutant protein-RNA complex than wild-type. Results were further correlated
with DCCM and binding energy.

Hydrogen bond interactions are correlated with dynamics cross-correlation matrix, where the
interaction between protein and RNA with respect to four complexes is calculated throughout
the trajectory of 100ns.
As shown in Figure 6, Dynamics cross-correlation matrix was calculated between inter and
intra protein motions in both wild-type and mutant (C241T) complexes. As previously
discussed in paper, SL1 and SL2 sequences are main interaction point in host-protein
MADP1 for SARS-CoV-2-RNA during viral replication. DCCM of 1000 snapshots was
performed. In DCCM matrix cyan colour indicates positive cross-correlation, magenta colour
indicates negative cross-correlation, and white colour indicates no cross-correlation. DCCM
was created for protein-protein, Protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interaction of Cα atoms in both
complexes. DCCM for MADP1-RNA complexes were shown in Figure 6. SL1 and SL2
residues in wild-type complex are showing much higher cyan color intensity with respect to
mutant complex (shown in box A). While in Box B nucleotide residues from SL3 were
shown. These residues are TLR-S residues among 5’UTR sequence. MADP1 showing unique
interaction within TLR-S sequence which is also depicting in DCCM (Box: B). Residues in
Box A were showing positive correlation with C alpha atoms of protein at Cij value of 0.250.85 in wild-type complex, while in mutant complex Cij value was decreased to 0.00 to
0.125.RNA nucleotide residues no 59 to 75 shows positive cross-correlation with protein
residues Lys-16, Phe57, Ile92, Ile94, Ala79, Lys-45, Thr-54, Arg-55, Arg35, Met-8, Ser-6,
Gly-7, Pro14 and Lys68 in wild-type protein-RNA complexes with more frequency than
mutant complex; which is depicted in box B in both figure 6A and 6B. Whereas for Box B ,
Cij values for mutant complex (0.39) were lower than wild type complex (0.87). Wild-type
complex’s RNA showed positive correlation in beta sheet residues (green colored) Lys52,
Thr47, and Arg35 of MADP1, where this correlation was absent in mutant complex. Lys42,
showed more positive correlation with wild-type RNA compared to Mutant RNA (C241T).
From DCCM, it is evident that intensity of positive cross correlation in SL1-SL2 of wild type
RNA is more compare to the mutant RNA with MADP1 (cyan).
DCCM of hnRNP1 is shown in Figure 7, where RNA nucleotide residues on C59, U60, G61,
and U62 show interaction with protein amino acid residues Gln180, Lys283, Lys206, Gln253,
Ile246 and Asn-48, Gln244 by the formation of hydrogen bonds within 3Å respectively. The
intensity of TLR-S sequence is clearly visible that TLR sequence shows a strong positive
correlation with wild-type RNA compared to the mutant which is shown in box A, B, C of
both complexes (Figure 7).
From DCCM it is clearly visible that residue interaction with host initiation factors shows
strong positive correlation with nucleotide residue of wild-type complex compares to mutant
complexes.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA was used to study the distinct protein conformational states in a principal component
(PC) phase space during the MD simulations. The conformational transitions of the
complexes were studied by projecting their trajectories onto a two-dimensional
subspace2spanned by the first three eigenvectors (PC1, PC2, and PC3) with respect to Cα
residues. In Supplementary Figure S10 & S11, both complexes attained two conformational
states on the subspace (shown in red and blue). The intermediate state located between these
two conformations is shown with white dots.
For hnRNP1, PC1/PC2 and PC3/PC1 of wild-type shows thermodynamically distinct
periodic jumps with a substantial energy barrier. While PC1/PC2 and PC2/PC1 of Mutant
complex shows overlapping PC subspaces that lack energy barriers. Value PC1 in the wild-

type complex is 71.95%, compare to 31.86% of PC1 in the mutant complex. The conjoined
distributions of PC1/PC2, PC1/PC3, and PC2/PC3 of the Mutant complex shows
energetically unstable complex (more scattered blue dots) compared to PC1/PC2, PC1/PC3,
and PC2/PC3 of wild-type complex. More scattered system in the Mutant complex leads
conclusion that, it is energetically less stable compared to wild-type.PC1/PC2 and PC3/PC1
of wild-type shows thermodynamically distinct periodic jumps with a substantial energy
barrier. While PC1/PC2 and PC2/PC1 of Mutant complex shows overlapping PC subspaces
that lack energy barriers (Supplementary Figure S11).
Same thing is observed in case of MADP1-RNA complexes, PC1 in wild-type complex is
64.35% and 73.42% of PC1 in mutant complex. More scattered system is observed PC2/PC3
suggests those principle modes are unstable in both complexes. PC3/PC1 of wild-type shows
periodic jumps with sustainable energy barrier, in mutant scatterings suggests unstable
system (Supplementary Figure S10).
Overall wild-type complex seems to be more stable compared to mutant (C241T) complex
with respect to both proteins.
Binding Energy components for Protein-RNA complexes
MMGBSA calculated for both protein-RNA complexes, where delta G bind is higher for
wild-type complex compared to mutant complexes for both the proteins MADP1 and
hnRNP1 (Table 3). First output structure containing minimized energy was taken in to study
for both complexes. Residual decomposition was analysed to get the contribution of each
residue within the complexes for favorable or unfavorable binding. To get insights regarding
to energy components contributing more favourable binding of wild type complex,
electrostatic, Hbonds, Van der Waals and ligand strain energy were analyzed.
For each protein-RNA complex, electrostatic energy is major energy component contributing
to favourable binding within both complexes, while Solv GB (Generalized Born electrostatic
solvation energy) significantly opposes the protein-RNA interaction and complex formation.
Both are rather substantial in magnitude but compensate each other, overall resulting in
favourable total electrostatic contributions.
Our major aim was to study the effect the mutation C241T with respect to host replication
factor MADP1, docking and molecular simulation studies shows the effect of mutation in
favour of host. Binding energy calculations are very crucial for commenting on the
complexes formation concerning both wild-type and mutant RNA. For MADP1, binding
energy for wild-type and mutant complex is -65.58kcal/mole and -54.66kcal/mole. From
binding energy, wild-type complex seems to have more efficient complex formation compare
to mutant. In figure 9 and 10, it is clearly visible that majority part of amino acid residues are
falling in lime green-blue zone which represents near to zero value for energy contribution in
mutant complex. While in the wild-type complex, residues favouring negative spontaneous
energy are significantly high.
In wild-type complex, amino acid residues interacting more spontaneous are Ser-1, Ser-2,
Gly-7, Ser-9, Met-8, Gly-11, Tyr-34, Met-49, Ile-48, Lys-43, Arg-55 and Lys-52, showing
interfacial hydrogen bonds and intermolecular stacking interactions with nucleotide residues
A6, U9, U11, U21, U19, G23, G24, and A35. Residues decomposition graph for MADP1
residues and WT-RNA shows higher negative energy compare to other basic residues within
the complex. It is interesting to study MADP1 residues 1-11 in both complexes, where
significant change was observed with respect to interaction. In wild-type complex those

residues (Ser-1, Ser-2, Gly-7, Ser-9, Met-8, and Gly-11) are involved in direct contact with
RNA nucleotide residues C19, C21, G23, and G24 shown in figure 9E. Direct interaction
shows more compactness in structure, which is also correlating with RMSF graph of MADP1
(Figure: 5B). While in mutant complex from those amino acid residues (1-11), Gly-1, Ser-2,
Ser-5, Leu-6, Ala-7, and Pro-8 shows positive decomposition energy (and no energy), and
leads to more fluctuations, hence less compact structure Wild-type (Figure 5B). Although for
mutant complex those residues posses’ high electrostatic and Van der Waals energy but more
positive Solv-GB energy of those residues hinders the complex formation. In wild type
complex MADP-1 residues Lys-52 (25.32kcal/mole), Met-49 (-15.08kcal/mole), Gly-7 (27.30kcal/mole), and Ile-48 (-20.17kcal/mole) shows 4-5-fold higher energy decomposition
compared to other basic residues (Figure 8A & 8B). In mutant complex amino acid residues
interacting with more spontaneous energy are Ser-38, Lys-39, Tyr-40, Asp-67, Ser-70, Val46, Tyr-34, and Asn-31 (showing direct contact with nucleotide residues) (Figure 10E).
From Figures 9 and 10, it is clear that the majority of amino acids residues where electrostatic
potential, Vander Waals and H-bonds interaction are high also shows high mmgbsa energy.
Amino acid residues Lys-39 (-21.30kcal/mole), Tyr-40 (-23.60kcal/mole), Ser-38 (5.63kcal/mole), Asn-31 (-15.63kcal/mole) and Tyr-34 (10.63kcal/mole) are interacting with
nucleotide residues at SL1 region of RNA and shows higher energy decomposition compared
to the other non-interacting residues. MADP1-WT complex have 11 amino acid residues
binding to nucleotide residues of RNA, compare to 8 amino acid residues binding to the
mutant RNA. Overall MADP1 shows a higher binding affinity to SL1 region in WT RNA
compare to mutant RNA.
For hnRNP1, binding energy for wild-type and mutant complex is -69.85 Kcal/mole and 45.85 Kcal/mole. Again wild-type complex seems to bind target with higher affinity compare
to mutant in case of hnRNP1 also. Other major contributing energy components for
complexes are Vander Waals energy and hydrogen-bond energy (Table 3). These three
energies are favoring complex formation more efficiently so energy potencies of each residue
in complex were analysed. As electrostatic energy is favoring the complex formation,
residues taking part in interaction are shown in term of electrostatic energy (Supplementary
Figure S12D and S13D). With respect to protein residues, heat maps were shown to correlate
amino acid residues with respect to their energy for complex formation. Protein interface
residues binding to RNA are showing positive electrostatic potential complimentarily to
negative electrostatic potential of the phosphate backbone of RNA (Supplementary Figure
12E and 13E). Extra positive electrostatic potential of residues, Lys 218, L, Lys-259, Arg-277,
Arg-254 and Arg185 favors enhanced binding to TLR-S sequence of RNA, henceforth
favouring efficient binding of wild-type complex (shown in blue) (Supplementary Figure
12E). To identify key residue important for binding, residual decomposition was analyzed for
both complexes. For wild type complex RNA residues, U47, C59, U60, U62, U63, C64, A79,
A81, C123 and G124 are interacting hnRNP1, covering TLR-S sequence –UCUU-, SL2 and
SL4. In mutant complex RNA residues, U11, U10, C32, A31, C66, A69, A68, A73 and A74
seem to be interact with hnRNP1. It was quite surprising that the minimized structure of
mutant was interacting within SL1 region, more efficiently compare to TLR-S region.
HnRNP1 is supposed to bind at TLRs region for viral proliferation, mutated complex (energy
minimized structure) is binding less efficiently to TLR-S region. Superimposition of both
minimized structures gives the clear idea for the above statements, wt-hnRNP1 is near to SL3
having TLR-S and SL4, while mut-hnRNP1 is near to SL2 and SL3 (Supplementary Figure
S12). From free energy decomposition, it was unsurprised that residues which were having
more hydrogen bond energy and electrostatic energy will possess higher decomposition
energy which correlating in figure 8. In wild-type complex RNA residues within the TLR-S

sequence possess more spontaneous, decomposition energy U60 (21.36kcal/mole), U62
(16.89kcal/mole) and C64 (-14.56kcal/mole) compare to the average of -1.5-2 kcal/mole with
same resides of the mutant complex. While in mutant residues, C66 (-11.53kcal/mole), A69
(-5.24kcaal/mole), A73 (-10.2kcal/mole), and A74 (-15.2kcal/mole) (Figure 8D). Wild-type
sequence seems to have more favourable binding in TLR-s sequence compare to mutant, so
241C seems to be favourable for viral proliferation compare to 241U.
Epidemiological data
Structural analysis of both RNA, reveal changes in TLR-S region while folding in 3D form,
which is affecting the binding of host replication factor MADP1. According to results
obtained through MD analysis Mutant, the complex seems to be less stable compare to wild
type based on RMSD and Hydrogen bonding between protein RNA complexes. In-Silico
findings suggest weaker interaction of mutant RNA with host factor MADP1 compared to
wild-type. This suggests lesser replication efficiency in mutant SARS-CoV-2 strain. The 5’
UTR variant C241T has emerged in March, 2020 and its one of the most observed variants in
genomes sequenced in 2020, with a frequency of 0.505 (22). To further correlate this finding,
epidemiological data of global cases, death rate, and the recovery rate was obtained from
World Health Organization covid-19 dashboard. The recovery rate in global cases has
increased from 2.2% in March 2020 to 70% to date whereas the overall decline in death rate
is observed (Supplementary Figure S15). Although there are many other reasons for
increased recovery rate, but the effect of most frequent mutation in the genome can also be
not neglected. According to WHO, before the ending of March death rate is 7.1% while
recently in October the death rate is 1.46 %.
The fact that if viral RNA is binding less efficiently with host replication factors due to
structural changes, the efficiency of virus replication within the host decreases. However,
these findings can be further validated experimentally using cell lines and other In-vitro
methods.
Conclusion
5’ UTR interactions with host factors were studied and it was concluded that C241T changes
the SL4, which overall changes the folding of RNA. MADP1 and HNRNP-1 reduce binding
shows a decrease in efficiency of the virus to replicate in a host, which in terms decrease the
death rate (increasing the recovery rate). Results were correlated with the epidemiological
data which is also showing an increased recovery rate all over the world. HnRNP1 interaction
which SARS-CoV two is not yet been studied. From our studies, it can be hypothesized that
hnRNP1 is binding to the –UCUU sequence present in SARS-Cov-2.
