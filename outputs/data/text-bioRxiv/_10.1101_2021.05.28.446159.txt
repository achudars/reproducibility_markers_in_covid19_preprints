Abstract

33

The beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is at the origin of a persistent worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-

34

2 infections initiate in the bronchi of the upper respiratory tract and are able to disseminate to

35

the lower respiratory tract eventually causing acute severe respiratory syndrome with a high

36

degree of mortality in the elderly. Here we use reconstituted primary bronchial epithelia from

37

adult and children donors to follow the infection dynamic following infection with SARS-CoV-2.

38

We show that in bronchial epithelia derived from adult donors, infections initiate in multi-ciliated

39

cells. Then, infection rapidly spread within 24-48h throughout the whole epithelia. Within 3-4

40

days, large apical syncytia form between multi-ciliated cells and basal cells, which dissipate into

41

the apical lumen. We show that these syncytia are a significant source of the released infectious

42

dose. In stark contrast to these findings, bronchial epithelia reconstituted from children donors

43

are intrinsically more resistant to virus infection and show active restriction of virus spread. This

44

restriction is paired with accelerated release of IFN compared to adult donors. Taken together our

45

findings reveal apical syncytia formation as an underappreciated source of infectious virus for

46

either local dissemination or release into the environment. Furthermore, we provide direct

47

evidence that children bronchial epithelia are more resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2

48

providing experimental support for epidemiological observations that SARS-CoV-2 cases’ fatality

49

is linked to age.

50

Significance Statement

51

Bronchial epithelia are the primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our work uses reconstituted

52

bronchial epithelia from adults and children. We show that infection of adult epithelia with SARS-

53

CoV-2 is rapid and results in the synchronized release of large clusters of infected cells and

54

syncytia into the apical lumen contributing to the released infectious virus dose. Infection of

55

children derived bronchial epithelia revealed an intrinsic resistance to infection and virus spread,

56

probably as a result of a faster onset of interferon secretion. Thus, our data provide direct

57

evidence for the epidemiological observation that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

65

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-

66

CoV), caused severe respiratory infections in humans during regionally confined epidemics in

67

2002 (1) and between 2010-15 (2), respectively. In late 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia

68

in Wuhan in the Hubei province in China were shown to be infected with the novel severe acute

69

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (3-5). SARS-CoV-2 infections are associated

70

with acute respiratory illness referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Since its description,

71

SARS-CoV-2 infections are at the root of an enduring worldwide pandemic, having caused as of

72

May 2021 over 3 million deaths and more than 148 million confirmed infections (data from the

73

John Hopkins university coronavirus resource center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). SARS-CoV-2

74

is an enveloped virus with a positive single-stranded RNA of around 30 kb. The 5’ proximal two

75

thirds of the polyadenylated genome encodes ORF1a and ORF1b, which are autoproteolytically

76

processed into several non-structural proteins required for replication and transcription. The

77

distal third encodes for the 4 structural proteins, Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N)

78

and Spike (S) and seven putative ORFs encoding accessory proteins and potential virulence factors

79

(6-8). The surface exposed Spike protein gives the virus its crown-like appearance in electron

80

microscopy and mediates the attachment to the main cellular receptor ACE2 (9). Coronaviruses

81

can cause a wide range of respiratory illnesses, from mild upper respiratory tract infection up to

82

a severe acute respiratory syndrome (10). The latter is characterized by excessive cytological

83

damage and inflammation. Post mortem biopsies in patients that died from COVID-19 point to

84

airways and lungs as primary targets of the disease (11, 12) with advanced diffuse alveolar

85

damage, pulmonary thrombosis and abnormal syncytia formation (13, 14). Several studies suggest

86

that cytokine storm and inflammatory infiltrates in the alveolar space are associated with disease

87

severity and death in COVID-19 (15, 16). While SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, it

88

shows much higher effective transmissibility (17, 18). One reason for this higher contagiousness

89

is an active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract at an early stage of infection,

90

with a high number of virus copies produced four days after the beginning of symptoms, and an

91

active replication in the throat (19) (20). Furthermore, Zou et al (21) reported that the viral load

92

detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that of symptomatic patients on day 4 after

93

symptoms onset, suggesting equal transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally

94

symptomatic patients at very early stages of infection (22). Epidemiological data have

95

demonstrated that if all ages of the population are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS3

96

CoV-2 infection severity is different between children versus the adult populations and varies with

97

age (23). A recent multi-national epidemiologic study found that children under 9 years old have

98

very low case-fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to older patients (24). Moreover,

99

these studies consolidate a large discrepancy in death rates of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients

100

associated with age. Death rate in children (<9 years) is under 0.001% increasing to 8% in elderly

101

patients (>80 years). A recent metadata analysis of several studies came to the same correlation

102

between age and severity (25). The reason for this age-related discrepancy is not clear and could

103

be linked to a decreased transmission and/or viral load with SARS-CoV-2 in children compared to

104

adults. Only limited data are available about the mechanism of viral spreading over time and how

105

the virus is released from the epithelia and might participate in the transmission of the infection

106

between individuals or within an individual. Over the course of a 51 days period, infection of a

107

reconstituted human airway epithelium infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed multiple waves of viral

108

replication associated with a degradation of tight junction and a decrease in ciliary expression (26,

109

27). In this model, plaque-like cytopathic effects could be observed with the formation of multi-

110

nucleated cells (28). Regarding the inflammatory response, interferon induction appears limited

111

in the most severe clinical cases (29-31). In contrast, release of INF-l was induced at day 4 post-

112

infection of bronchial epithelia (BE). Noteworthy, viral RNA production in BE increased at day 2,

113

suggesting a delay in the induction of the cellular antiviral response. A very recent report studying

114

cell-intrinsic changes occurring in differentiated human nasal epithelial cultures from children,

115

adults and elderly, have shown that ageing contributed to viral load, transcriptional responses,

116

IFN signaling and antiviral responses (32). Yet, such data using a model mimicking the human

117

bronchial epithelium are still missing. Here, we developed a model of reconstituted bronchial

118

epithelium (BE) in air-liquid interface derived from bronchial epithelium samples of adult donors,

119

which is the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We monitored the replication of SARS-CoV-2

120

over several days and followed virus spread in the epithelia. Using high-resolution imaging, we

121

observed the massive formation and apical release of syncytia occurring between day three and

122

four post-infection. We showed that syncytia and cells released into the apical lumen are

123

infectious, suggesting they contribute to the spreading of the virus in the epithelium, and by

124

extension, may transmit virus within the patient to the lower respiratory tract or into the

125

environment. Furthermore, using reconstituted BE derived from children, we showed that viral

126

production in children epithelia is very low compared to adults, and that viral spread is restricted.

127

These results may explain the clinical and epidemiological observations that SARS-CoV-2 is more

128

likely to infect older patients than children and that older patients show more severe clinical

129

manifestations.

133

Generation of a fully differentiated bronchial epithelia model

134

One of the major initial targets for SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract. Primary infections often

135

initiate in the upper respiratory tract from which they can spread to the lower respiratory tract to

136

cause severe disease (18). Bronchial epithelia are pseudo-stratified cell layers with typical cell

137

junctions, as well as a mucus layer and beating cilia on the lumen side (33, 34). To study the SARS-

138

CoV-2 infection process in a physiologically relevant model, we established a cellular in vitro

139

model of bronchial epithelia differentiated in air-liquid interface from individual donors (Fig. S1).

140

Primary bronchial epithelial cells were collected from surgical bronchial resection or fibroscopy

141

from individual adult donors at the Bordeaux university hospital. Patients were between 46 and

142

63 years old with a normal body mass index [BMI] (Table1). Basal epithelial cells were expanded

143

in vitro in culture flask until confluence. Basal cells were then seeded on cell culture insert and

144

differentiated at the air-liquid interface for approximately 21 days (Fig. S1A).

145

differentiation protocol, we were able to generate between 12-24 individual inserts from a single

146

donor allowing comparative analysis. Immuno-fluorescence (IF) analysis confirmed the presence

147

of differentiated cell types. Specific antibodies allowed the detection of acetylated tubulin and

148

mucin, characteristic of multi-ciliated cells and goblet cells respectively (Fig. S1B, movie S1) or

149

acetylated tubulin and cytokeratin 5 (multi-ciliated cells and basal cells, Fig. S1C, movie S2). This

150

analysis confirmed the pseudostratified apical-to-basolateral organizational integrity of the

151

epithelia, e.g. a single cell layer of apical multi-ciliated cells covering a layer of basal cells and was

152

further confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. S1D). The presence of well differentiated cilia

153

structures and tight junctions was also confirmed (Fig. S1D). Next, we determined the localization

154

of ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in our model using IF analysis (Fig. S1E, movie S3).

155

Co-label with antibodies against ACE2 and acetylated tubulin confirmed that ACE2 was expressed

156

in apical multi-ciliated cells as previously reported (4, 35). Moreover, our data showed a

prominent exposure of ACE2 on individual cilia reaching into the apical lumen (orange arrows),

158

which suggests facilitated access e.g. for virus coming in through the respiratory tract.

160

SARS-CoV-2 monitoring and BE infection

161

Next, BE were inoculated on the apical side with a suspension of a reference SARS-CoV-2 strain

162

(BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.012. Apical and

163

basolateral compartments were collected 3 days post-infection (dpi) and used to infect Vero E6

164

cells (Fig. 1A). A cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in the Vero E6 cell culture as early as 2 days

165

post-infection when inoculated with the apical washes, indicating an effective infection and

166

replication of the virus (Fig. 1A). When using the basal medium, 3 days of inoculation were

167

necessary to observe a similar CPE (Fig. 1A). This faster appearance of CPE when using the apical

168

fraction may be correlated to a higher viral titre compared to the basal medium. To ascertain that

169

this CPE is indeed due to viral replication and not a toxic effect from the inoculation, we extracted

170

total RNAs from the Vero E6 supernatant on the next day (4 dpi) and quantified viral RNAs using

171

in-house qRT-PCR targeting the N-gene region. No RNA could be detected in the supernatant of

172

Vero E6 cells inoculated with either the apical or basolateral fractions obtained from non-infected

173

BE (Fig. 1B, control). In contrast, when using basolateral or the apical fraction from infected BEs,

174

the Vero E6 supernatant contained high level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, comparable to what is observed

175

with a direct infection of Vero E6 cells infected at a MOI of 0.01 (Fig. 1B). These data attest that

176

SARS-CoV-2 actively replicates in reconstituted BE and that inoculation from the apical side results

177

in an active infection. To detect virus-infected cells, we generated monoclonal antibodies against

178

the SARS-CoV-2 N nucleocapsid protein using bacterially expressed and purified full-length

179

protein as detailed in the methods section. Hybridoma supernatants were tested using western

180

blot and IF detection through confocal microscopy (Fig. S2). Of several positive clones, hybridoma

181

clone 3G9 was selected for this study as it specifically recognized the N protein of SARS-CoV-2

182

(Fig. S2A) and detected infected cells in IF staining (Fig. S2B). To investigate which cell type is the

183

primary target during SARS-CoV-2 infection, fully differentiated epithelia were infected with SARS-

184

CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.01 for 1 h from the apical side after which the viral suspension was removed.

185

Epithelia were fixed 24h post-infection in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and processed for IF

186

analysis using SARS-CoV-2-N specific antibodies. We successfully detected infected cells in the BE

187

(green signal Fig. 1C-E). Specific co-label of Muc5A showed that goblet cells were not infected

188

(magenta signal, Fig. 1C, movie S4). Similarly, no co-localization could be observed between the

189

SARS-CoV-2 N protein and CytK5 showing that basal cells were not infected either (Fig. 1D, movie

190

S5). Conversely, the signal arising for the N protein staining was systematically associated with

191

strong labelling for acetylated tubulin, a specific marker for multi-ciliated cells (orange arrow, Fig.

192

1E, movie S6). This is consistent with previous reports that apical multi-ciliated cells are the

193

primary target cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection (4, 28, 36). In addition, all BEs were co-labelled with

194

fluorescent phalloidin to mark cell boundaries for 3D imaging of the entire epithelial depth.

195

Infected cells were exclusively located at the apical surface of the BE (Fig. 1C-E). All IF data were

196

confirmed using BE generated from at least two different donors, suggesting that the primary

197

infection of epithelial cells is determined by the epithelia architecture and is not due to the genetic

198

background of the donor.

199
200

Infection kinetic of epithelia from different adult donors

201

To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in the epithelium after initial infection of multi-

202

ciliated cells, we infected BEs from four individual adult donors (A1 to A4, Table 1) and monitored

203

them over the course of 7 days. Low magnification images obtained using IF microscopy showed

204

that N protein could be detected within 24h of infection in a small number of cells (Fig. 2A).

205

Nonetheless, the signal number and intensity increased drastically from the 2 dpi time-point and

206

tended to decrease slightly towards the end of the observation period (Fig. 2A). Similar results

207

were obtained with the other two donors suggesting rapid onset of viral replication and spread

208

(not shown). We quantified the number of N-positive signals at low resolution for each donor

209

confirming that the number of infected cells strongly increased within two to three days of the

210

initial infection, reaching a maximum around day four, and consistently decreased somewhat on

211

the seventh day for all donors (Fig. 2B). Of note, much larger N protein associated signals could

212

be observed at the peak of the infection. These larger structures were co-labelled with cytokeratin

213

5, the marker for basal cells (see arrows in Fig. 2A). This observation started on the third day but

214

was most prominent on the fourth day and was observed for all donors. Therefore, we also

215

quantified the size of the N protein associated signals over time (Fig. 2C). The analysis revealed a

216

statistically significant average increase in signal size between the third and fourth day for all four

217

donors. In parallel to the imaging analysis, release of newly produced viruses into the apical mucus

218

was quantified by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2D). For all four donors, the viral RNA copy number correlated

219

with the observed cellular N protein labelling with a fast increase from day 2 reaching a plateau

220

between 3 and 4 dpi. Altogether, these data suggested that apical SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of BEs

221

resulted in efficient infection and subsequent progeny production and release into the apical

222

lumen.

223
224

Infected multi-ciliated cells form syncytia with basal cells at the apical side of the BE

225

Using high-resolution microscopy, we observed that larger N-positive signals corresponded to

226

multinucleated cellular structures reminiscent of syncytia. These syncytia could be found in all

227

regions of the epithelia (Fig. 3) and their formation at day 4 was common to all four donors tested.

228

In contrast, we did not observe any syncytia formation in non-infected control epithelia.

229

Unexpectedly, the N-positive syncytia forming on day three and four also stained positive for the

230

basal cell marker cytokeratin 5 (Fig. 3A). This was not the case at earlier time points (day one and

231

two) where basal cells rarely stained positive for N protein and did not form syncytia. Accordingly,

232

we quantified the number of double positive syncytia (i.e, nucleocapsid protein and cytokeratin

233

5) over time (Fig. 3B). The proportion of double positive cells (i.e, syncytia) increased constantly

234

and reached a maximum on the fourth day after which there is a drastic drop in double positive

235

cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Normalization of the double positive cells for either the total amount

236

of basal cells (Fig. 3B, middle panel) or the total amount of infected cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel)

237

revealed that double positive cells but not overall infected cells disappeared on day four. We also

238

observed that the newly formed multinucleated cells only partially stained for acetylated tubulin

239

(Fig. 3C). Zooming in on different regions of the epithelia revealed that newly formed syncytia

240

frequently lost their stain for acetylated tubulin (Fig. 3C side panel). Moreover, syncytia that still

241

expressed acetylated tubulin presented an amorphous staining, and rarely distinguished cilia

242

features. Similarly, part of the syncytial structures failed to stain with phalloidin (e.g. Fig. 3A, right

243

panel), that was used to delineate cells in the epithelia. Altogether, Cytokeratin 5, phalloidin and
8

244

acetylated tubulin staining patterns suggested that syncytia were formed through the fusion of

245

infected ciliated cells with basal cells, associated with the loss of cilia and reorganization of

246

cytoskeletal features including the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, three-

247

dimensional imaging of epithelia showed that syncytia formed exclusively on the apical side of the

248

epithelium and forming an elevated layer on top of the epithelia (Fig. 3A right and 3C bottom

249

panel, see also movie S7 and S8). These extrusions were also observed using EM (Fig. 3D, white

250

asterisk), but never in the context of non-infected epithelia (Fig. S1). These structures harbored

251

only reminiscent cilia structures in place of multi-ciliated cells in non-infected epithelia. This latter

252

observation is consistent with previous reports showing that SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung

253

epithelial cells trigger the partial loss of cilia (27). Importantly, using EM we observe vesicular

254

inclusions within those extruded cells that contained virus particles indicating that multi-

255

nucleated infected structures actively produced viruses (Fig. 3D, black arrows).

256
257

Infected cells and syncytia are released into the apical BE lumen and transmit infection

258

Because cells and syncytia were extruding from the epithelium, we wondered whether infected

259

cells/syncytia could be released from the epithelium and account for the spreading of the

260

infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected epithelia from two donors for three and four days.

261

Apical washes of epithelia were performed after three and four days of infection and

262

concentrated on microscope slides via cytospin. After IF processing, we showed that apical

263

washes contained individual infected cells (positive for N-protein staining) but also several

264

infected syncytia, suggesting that both are indeed released into the apical epithelial lumen (Fig.

265

4A). To test the relative infectivity, apical washes were clarified of cell material by low-speed

266

centrifugation. Both the clarified supernatant and the removed cellular fraction were used to

267

infect Vero E6 cells. After 24h, cells were fixed and analyzed by IF microscopy. Inoculation with

268

the supernatant as well as the cellular fraction of the apical wash showed efficient Vero E6 cell

269

infection (data not shown). In parallel, inoculated Vero E6 cells were monitored for the

270

appearance of a virus-induced CPE. Apical wash after 4 days of epithelia infection resulted in CPE

271

within 48h whereas a comparable CPE required 72h with an apical wash resulting from a 3 days

272

infection (data not shown). AT 96h post-infection the Vero E6 cell CPE was quantified (Fig. 4B).

273

Apical washes from non-infected epithelia produced only background levels of cell death (gray

274

bars, Fig. 4B). In contrast, significant levels of cell death occurred in Vero E6 cell after inoculation

275

with either the supernatant or the pellet (cellular fraction) of an apical wash issued from an

276

infected epithelium (black bars, Fig. 4B). Taken together this analysis shows that epithelia produce

277

and release large amounts of new viruses into the apical lumen, a significant fraction of the

278

released infectious virus dose stems from infected cells and syncytia.

279
280

Epithelia from children partially restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection but not syncytia formation

281

In our experimental model, each epithelium can be traced to an individual donor, while generating

282

enough individual inserts to allow biological repeats and kinetic studies. Our analysis showed that

283

epithelia from several adult donors responded similarly to the infection with SARS-CoV-2. A

284

striking observation was that infections spread very fast over the entire epithelia and produced

285

vast amounts of syncytia for apical release in a synchronized manner. Adult donors in this study

286

were between 46 and 63 years old (table 1), which puts them statistically into a medium/high risk

287

group to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms. In contrast, several reports have indicated that

288

children are much less susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19, while their role in spreading virus

289

infections is controversially discussed (37, 38). To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infects BEs

290

differently depending on the age of donors, we prepared epithelia through expansion and

291

differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells obtained from children (Table 1) that have undergone

292

bronchial fibroscopy for chronic bronchopathy (child C1) or bronchiectasis (children C2 and C3).

293

Fully differentiated epithelia from children showed the same cellular arrangement (epithelial

294

cells, basal cells, goblet cells) and physiological properties (cilia beating, mucus production) as

295

adult derived epithelia. A kinetic experiment was performed to compare the SARS-CoV-2 infection

296

dynamics in BEs derived from children (C1 to C3) or from adult donors (A5 and A6). The BEs were

297

fixed at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 d.p.i. with a non-infected control for each donor run in parallel and fixed

298

at day 7. Individual epithelia were fixed and processed for IF analysis using antibodies against

299

cytokeratin 5, SARS-CoV-2 N-protein and counterstained with fluorescently labelled phalloidin

300

and DAPI. As observed before (Fig. 2), infecting BEs from adult donors at a MOI of 0.012 resulted

301

in a fast increase in the presence of infected cells (within 48h) and the formation of a significant

302

amount of syncytia on the fourth day (A6, Fig. S3A). In sharp contrast, all child derived epithelia

303

showed a remarkable resistance to virus infection (Fig. S3 B-D). Of note, virus spread differed

304

significantly in BE originating from the individual child donor. A slow but substantial increase in

305

infected cells over time was observed in BE derived from donor C1 (Fig. S3B). In comparison, BE

306

derived from C2 did not support substantially increase of the number of infected cells after the

307

initial appearance of positive cells (Fig. S3C) and BE derived from the last donor, C3, only ever

308

showed very few infected cells, reminiscent of an abortive infection (Fig. S3D). Low magnification

309

imaging of the entire epithelia showed that initial infections in BE from donor C1 were limited to

310

few cells. The N-protein associated signal seemed to grow over time into foci of infection that

311

further enlarged by infecting surrounding cells at the periphery (Fig. 5A, top row, left). High-

312

resolution images confirmed that cells at the foci border stained strongly, while several cells

313

surrounding these foci were already positive for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein. This suggested the

314

existence of a front of highly replicating cells with forward cell-to-cell or short range spread as

315

infection mode (Fig. 5B). In contrast, infection spread in epithelia from donor C2 seemed to be

316

even more restricted (Fig. 5A, bottom row, left). In the case of the BE derived from the child donor

317

C2, most of the cells that were initially infected at day one/two developed into local cluster of

318

infected cells without much lateral spread. High-resolution imaging revealed that within these

319

clusters, several cells fused with basal cells to form small syncytia that had apical localization (Fig.

320

5C, movie S9), reminiscent with what was observed in adult donors. It is only after seven days of

321

infection that some spreading into small patches could be observed, mimicking observations

322

made for C1 on the second and third day of infection. Low magnification imaging of the entire

323

epithelia derived from child C3 confirmed sporadic infection signals in the BEs, while the adult-

324

derived control A7 showed massive spread of the infection throughout the entire epithelia at 4

325

d.p.i (right panel, Fig. 5A). Quantifying the total number of infected cells in each epithelium

326

confirmed our observation (Fig. 5D). In contrast to the adult control, no significant differences in

327

signal size was observed between day three and day four for either of the children derived

328

epithelia (Fig. 5E). Still, the average signal size appeared larger likely due to clustering of infected

329

cells (Fig. 5E). For all three children derived epithelia and the adult control we also measured the

330

accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the apical lumen using quantitative PCR (Fig. 5F). The quantities

331

of released virus over time accurately reflected the spread of infection observed by IF and

332

quantification of infected cells. Taken together our analysis clearly demonstrated that epithelia

333

from children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and exhibited an intrinsic resistance towards

334

virus infection and/or spread. One possible explanation for this intrinsic resistance of children BE

335

could be differences in IFN response (39, 40) or morphological differences (41). Accordingly, we

336

compared the accumulation of interferon l 1/3 and measured the concentration in BE medium

337

from adults and children in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5G). We did not find interferon

338

l at the beginning of the infection. Children BE secreted interferon l starting at day 1 post-

339

infection whereas adult BE produced detectable amount of interferon l only at day 3 post-

340

infection. Interferon l concentration increased subsequently for both age groups and reached

341

similar levels at day 4 and 7 post-infection (Fig. 5G). The difference in the kinetic for Interferon l

342

secretion between adults and children in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus provide an

343

explanation why in our model children derived BE resist better to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Still, the

344

strength of this resistance differs from donor to donor and delays virus spread to different degrees

345

or may prevent virus spread entirely.

infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in BE. Our approach uses primary cells from individual

352

patients obtained through our local hospital collected in the bronchial tree between the third and

353

fifth generation. Bronchial epithelia are an important tissue to study because following initial

354

infection in the upper airways, subsequent infection of the bronchial tissue determines whether

355

a SARS-CoV-2 infection results in severe or mild respiratory illness by controlling the spread into

356

the lower respiratory tract. These features make a distinction in our approach from similar studies

357

using primary respiratory cells from either upper airway (nasal, tracheal) (3, 26) or commercial

358

sources (27) with undefined donor material. Using this physiological model, we observed SARS-

359

CoV-2 production mainly on the apical side of the epithelia following infection. We then used

360

immunofluorescence imaging to follow and compare the infection in the BE from several

361

individual donors for seven days. This approach allowed the detection of infected cells as early as

362

24h post-infection. The infection spread throughout the whole epithelia within three to four days

363

post inoculation followed by a drop in the number of infected cells on the last day. Quantification

364

of viral RNA confirmed these observations and showed that viral replication reached a plateau

In this study, we used human reconstituted bronchial epithelia to investigate the onset of

365

around day four post-infection. Using cell specific markers, we identified that infected cells during

366

the first two days corresponded largely to multi-ciliated cells staining positive for acetylated

367

tubulin in agreement with previous studies (26, 28). We rarely observed infected basal or goblet

368

cells during this period. Interestingly, starting at day three of the infection not only the infected

369

cell number but also the signal size of infected cells increased with a statistically significant shift

370

towards larger cells between day three and four. We could show that the larger signals

371

corresponded to infected multinucleated syncytia. The formation of cell fusions in coronavirus

372

infected primary airway epithelia was previously reported (28, 42) but not systematically detected

373

(26, 27, 32). In our study, we were able to find extensive syncytia formation in all six adult donors.

374

Syncytia formation was transient and reached a maximum at day four to sharply drop towards

375

the seventh day. The fusogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 is well known and involves the Spike

376

protein and the ACE2 receptor (43, 44). When we used cell specific markers to identify the syncytia

377

cell composition we found that several syncytia were double positive for the basal cell marker

378

cytokeratin 5 as well as the cilia marker acetylated tubulin or only for the basal cell marker (Fig.

379

3). This suggested that syncytia are formed by the fusion of basal cells with infected multi-ciliated

380

cells. This is consistent with previous reports that infection of multi-ciliated cells with SARS-CoV-

381

2 results in cilia loss and cell dedifferentiation (27, 28). Fusion of initially infected multi-ciliated

382

cells with basal cells as one mode of virus cell-to-cell spread was further supported by

383

quantification of infected syncytia positive for cytokeratin 5, which constantly increased in

384

number until day four in all analyzed donors. The sharp drop on day four in the number of double

385

positive syncytia, but not in the number of overall infected cells, is consistent with our observation

386

that syncytia were extruded at the apical side of the epithelia. We found frequent syncytia

387

forming at the apical side of the epithelia positive for the N nucleoprotein and EM analysis showed

388

that they indeed contained high amounts of virus trapped in a vesicular compartment.

389

Furthermore, we were able to show that infected syncytia are released into the apical supernatant

390

and that released syncytia and infected cells are as infectious as free virus (Fig. 4). This strongly

391

suggests that infected syncytia and cell release into the apical lumen could be an important

392

contribution to the spreading of large and compact amounts of viruses into the upper respiratory

393

tract from which cell associated virus can either decent into the lower respiratory tract or reach

394

the environment increasing the actual infectious dose. Interestingly, pathology reports from

395

patients succumbed to Covid-19 show abnormal syncytia formed by pneumocytes in the lower

396

respiratory tract suggesting that our observations in the BE model find their counterpart in severe

397

forms of COVID-19 (14, 45, 46). Accordingly, such an event would be in agreement with the clinical

398

observation of hospitalized patients, which reported a high detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum

399

and its transmission by droplets (19). The fact that syncytia production is massive but transient is

400

well correlated with another report showing that virus production in a primary airway epithelium

401

is cyclic with peaks of virus release every 7-10 days (26). The authors suggest that this periodicity

402

is driven by recurrent epithelia removal and regeneration. Interestingly, such a peak in virus

403

production would provide an explanation for the phenomenon of “super spreader”, frequently

404

suggested based on epidemiological data (47). A periodicity or variability in the quantity of virus

405

released from infected tissue thus may affect contagion. Furthermore, we also observed the loss

406

of cilia in many of the syncytia, which could be responsible for a poor mucociliary clearance that

407

impedes the evacuation of viral particles and pathogens. Taken together, our findings are in

408

accordance with previous findings but highlight syncytium formation as an important mechanism

409

to explain the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and the physiopathology of bronchial epithelium infection

410

(14, 43, 45, 46). Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection is more

411

virulent in adults compared to children. We explored the bronchial epithelium infection of

412

children with SARS-CoV-2 and compared our observations with those made in BE from adult

413

donors. Strikingly, we find very different spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in children BE versus adult BE.

414

First, the overall viral production was very low in BE of children compared to adults, which is

415

reflecting the slower kinetic in the onset of virus production over time. In agreement with the

416

virus quantification, child epithelia showed a remarkable resistance to virus infection as very few

417

infected cells were observed. Rather than rapidly spreading throughout the entire epithelia, as

418

observed for adults, the infected cells in children form cluster or foci of infected cells. From these

419

foci, the infection slowly spread into the surrounding bystander cells. Yet, syncytia formation was

420

also observed, at least in one child, suggesting that the fusion of basal cells with multi-ciliated

421

cells was not restricted to adult infected BE. However, the number of syncytia was much lower

422

than in adults reflecting the low virus spread. The obvious difference in susceptibility to SARS-

423

CoV-2 infection between adults and children, which we observed in the BE model is in agreement

424

with the reduced epidemiological infection rate described for children and strong discrepancy in

425

death rate between children and adults/elderly (24, 25). A very recent study using nasal BE also

426

showed differences in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between adults and children (32).

427

The reason for this intrinsic difference between adults and children BE is unknown. One possible

428

explanation could be an age-related variation in the expression or accessibility of the primary viral

429

receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) (48). We show that children BE have a quicker induction of

430

interferon l in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection starting as soon as 1-day post-infection whereas

431

adults BE exhibit detectable level of interferon l only 3-day post-infection. Recent studies show

432

that SARS-CoV-2 blocks the interferon response by targeting the RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway (49, 50).

433

Our study is consistent with a delay of Interferon l production after SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults

434

but less so in children. This could suggest that either SARS-CoV-2 is less efficient in counteracting

435

the IFN response in children BE or alternatively, that the IFN response in children is faster and an

436

antiviral state is induced throughout the epithelia that slows down virus spread. Such an age-

437

related susceptibility of BE has been reported for other respiratory pathogens including

438

respiratory viruses such as Rhinovirus-C, Adenovirus and RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) (51,

439

52)(53) but also fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus) (54) and bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae) (55).

440

Future studies will be required to study the exact mechanism behind the differences in IFN

441

response that we observed. Taken together our data clearly demonstrate that BE from children

442

are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest that an accelerated interferon

443

response might contribute to this resistance supporting timed interferon application as

444

therapeutically beneficial concept in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections (56-58).

Viruses and cell lines

459

Vero E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco)

460

supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and gentamicin (50µg/mL) at 37°C in a humidified

461

CO2 incubator. The SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was supplied by the

462

National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Pasteur Institute (Paris, France)

463

through the European Virus Archive goes Global (EVAg platform). Agreement to work with

464

infectious SARS-CoV-2 was obtained and all work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a

465

Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions at the UB’L3 facility (TBM core, Bordeaux).

466

Viral production

467

The SARS-CoV-2 strain was produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

468

of 0.01, then incubating the cells at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator until appearance of a

469

cytopathic effect (around 72 h). The culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (5 minutes

470

at 1500 rpm) and aliquots were stored at −80°C. Stock titers were determined by adding serial

471

dilutions to 2 × 104 Vero E6 cells in supplemented DMEM in a 96-well plate. Eight replicates were

472

performed. Plates were incubated at 37°C and examined for cytopathic effect. Quantification of

473

cytopathic effect was determined using the Cell tox

474

according to manufacturer instructions and a Victor Nivo reader (Perkin Elmer). The TCID50 was

within the air-liquid interface for 21 days using PneumaCult ALI medium (Stemcell, Vancouver,

484

Canada). Such a culture allows the differentiation into pseudostratified muco-ciliary airway

485

epithelium composed of ciliated cells, goblet cells, club cells and basal cells. The complete

486

differentiation was assessed by the capacity of cilia to beat and mucus production under light

487

microscope. The study received approval from the local and national ethics committee from the

488

CNIL through the TUBE collections.

489

Infection of epithelia

490

Prior to infection, epithelia were washed three times with PBS to remove mucus and basal ALI

491

medium was exchanged with 500 µL of fresh medium. The inoculum containing 1200 PFU of virus

492

or medium-only controls were added to the apical surface to a final volume of 100 µL. Viral

493

supernatant was removed after 1 hour incubation at 37°C and infection was followed for the

494

indicated time points. Viral production was then quantified by qRT-PCR using 3 consecutively

495

collected apical washes of 100 µL PBS.

496

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by qRT-PCR

497

For quantification of viral RNA by qRT-PCR, total RNA was isolated using the High Pure Viral RNA

498

kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Viral RNA was quantified using GoTaq® 1-

499

Step RT-qPCR kit (Promega). SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA was amplified using forward (Ngene F

500

cgcaacagttcaagaaattc 28844-28864) and reverse primers (Ngene R ccagacattttgctctcaagc 28960-

501

28981). Copy numbers were calculated from a standard curve produce with serial 10-fold dilutions

502

of SARS-CoV-2-RNA. Amplification program began with the RT-step 15 min at 50°C then the

503

denaturation step 10 min at 95°C, and 10 s at 95°C, 10 s at 60°C and 10 s at 72°C (40 cycles). The

504

melting curve was obtained by temperature increment 0,5°C/s from 60°C to 95°C.

510

For antigen detection, BE were washed repeatedly with PBS to remove mucus then fixed with 4%

511

paraformaldehyde for 30min using complete insert immersion. Epithelia were then washed and

512

permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS for 10min at room temperature and blocked in IF

513

buffer (PBS containing 10% SVF and 0.5% saponin) for 1h at room temperature. Primary antibody

514

and fluorescently labeled phalloidin to stain the actin cytoskeleton was diluted in IF buffer and

515

applied to inserts for 1h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times under agitation

516

with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody diluted in IF buffer and incubated for 2h at room

517

temperature. Insert were then washed in PBS, desalted in H2O miliQ and rinsed in Ethanol 100%

518

and air-dried. Membranes were then removed from inserts and mounted in DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-

519

2-phenylindole) containing DAKO Fluorescence Mounting Medium prior to microscopy analysis.

520

Mounted samples were subsequently examined on an epifluorescence microscope (Leica inverted

521

DRMi6000 widefield microscope) at low resolution for kinetic studies. High resolution analysis

522

was performed on a SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems at the Bordeaux Imagery

523

center) using maximal pixel resolution at 20x, 40x or 63x respectively and 0.3µm Z-stacks

524

resolution. Full epithelia overviews were acquired with Leica LAS-X software in spiral mosaics

525

mode and three-dimensional reconstructions were done with Leica LAS-X software in 3D-viewer

526

mode. Image processing was done using Image J software. Signal of interest were quantified using

527

a semi-automatic macro. Briefly, Z-projections of different focal planes were generated and

528

regions of interest (ROI) were manually inserted. Signal of interest was quantified automatically

529

in each ROI, with appropriate predefined threshold and sizing for each condition. Quantification

530

were performed to measured either number or size of signal of interest. Obtained values are

531

represented either as absolute number or as normalized values (as indicated). The following

532

primary antibodies and IF dilutions were used in this study; mouse monoclonal Ab anti-SARS-CoV-

533

2-N clone 3G9 (this study, 1:500), rabbit monoclonal Ab anti-human Cytokeratin 5 (Abcam,

534

536

human-Mucin 5AC (Abcam, ab198294, 1:200). The following secondary antibodies were used in

537

this study; cross absorbed Donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 (Life technologies,

538

A212020/A31571, 1:300) and cross absorbed Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Life

For electron microscopy, epitheliums were first washed in physiological serum and then fixed with

547

France) 50/50 (v/v) during 2 hours and then in 100% resin overnight at RT. The polymerization of

548

the resin was carried out over a period between 24-48 hours at 60°C. Samples were then

549

sectioned using a diamond knife (Diatome, Biel-Bienne, Switzerland) on an ultramicrotome (EM

550

UCT, Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were picked up on copper

551

grids and then stained with uranyless and lead citrate. Grids were examined with a Transmission

552

Electron Microscope (H7650, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 80kV.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 infection of bronchial epithelia (BE). A: The left panel shows brightfield
microscopy images of Vero E6 cells at either day 2 (top row) or day 3 (bottom row) post-inoculation
with apical washes, basolateral media or a viral suspension (MOI of 0.01). B: Quantification of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Vero E6 supernatant. Total RNA were extracted 96h post-infection and
quantified by qRT-PCR. Mean and standard deviation are derived from 3 independent
determinations except for the positive control (Vero E6 infected directly with a viral suspension
instead of BE fractions). C: Differentiated BE were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and stained 24h
post-infection with anti-N (green signal) to identify infected cells and anti-Muc5A to detect goblet
cells (magenta signal) and counterstained with DAPI (grey signal). Top image shows a Z-projection,
the bottom image shows an individual Z-section of a 3D reconstruction counterstained with
phalloidin. Scale bar is 10µm, for full Z-stack see movie S4. D: Experiment and presentation as in
(B) stained with anti-N (green signal) to identify infected cells and anti-cytokeratin 5 to identify basal
cells (magenta signal) and counterstained with DAPI (grey signal). Scale bar is 10µm, for full Zstack see movie S5. E: Experiment and presentation as in (B) stained with anti-N (green signal) to
identify infected cells and anti-acetylated tubulin to identify multiciliated cells (magenta signal) and
counterstained with DAPI (grey signal). Scale bar is 10µm, for full Z-stack see movie S6.

Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetic of bronchial epithelia (BE). A: Representative widefield
microscopy images of BE from two adult donors (A3 left panel, A4 right panel) at low resolution.
Scale bar is 20µm. BE were fixed at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 as indicated to the left of each row, noninfected controls were also fixed at day 7. BE were stained with anti-N antibodies to detect infected
cells (green signal first column), anti-cytokeratin 5 to detect basal cells (magenta signal, second
column) and counterstained with DAPI (grey signal, third column) and a merge of the three signals
(forth column). Large specific signals in all channels are apparent on day four (white arrows). B:
The absolute number of N-positive signals was determined for each BE for the whole epithelia on
each day as indicated. Data shown are absolute number of N dots quantification at different days
post-infection and described in material and methods. The (#) sign marks points with partial BE
damage C: Signals quantified in (B) were classed by size and plotted as min to max Box & Whisker
plots, *** : P< 0.001 based on One way ANOVA. D: Apical washes for each BE were subject to RTqPCR analysis to determine genome copy numbers at day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 post-infection as
indicated.

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 infection of bronchial epithelia (BE) induces apical syncytia. A: High
resolution image analysis of entire BE 4 days post-infection (left panel, adult A4). BE were stained
with anti-N antibodies to detect infected cells (green signal) and anti-cytokeratin 5 marking basal
cells (magenta signal) and counterstained with DAPI (grey signal in the left panel, blue on the right
panel). The boxed inset is magnified and one individual syncytia is indicated by the orange arrow.
The syncytia is further magnified as maximum Z-projection (left) or as individual Z-stack (right, with
phalloidin counterstain in red), or as 3D image reconstruction to see its apical location. Scale bar
is 10µm, 50µm, 200µm respectively. See also movie S7. B: Estimation of the total number of double
positive (N and cytokeratin 5) was determined (top panel) and normalized for total number of basal
cells (middle panel) and total number of infected cells (bottom panel). Data shown are absolute
number of colocalisations between N and cytokeratin 5 for four different donors, as determined
using semi-automatic quantification. Absolute number of colocalisation was then normalized by
absolute number of cytokeratin 5 or N positive cells. Data are presented as mean ± SD, n = 4. C:
High resolution image analysis of entire BE 4 days post-infection. Experiment and image
representation as in (A). BE were stained with anti-N antibodies to detect infected cells (green
signal) and anti-acetylated tubulin detecting multi-ciliated cells (magenta signal) and counterstained
with DAPI (grey signal in the top panel, blue on the bottom panel). Double positive syncytia are
marked by orange arrow, single positive syncytia with white arrow. Scale bar is 10µm, 50µm,
200µm respectively. See also movie S8. D: Electron micrograph of infected BE 4 days postinfection. The large images show extruded cell on the apical side of the epithelia (white asterisk)
adjacent to multi ciliated cells (black asterisk). The insets show virus containing vacuoles in the
extruded cell as indicated by black arrows. Scale bars are provided in the image (5µm for large
images and 200nm for insert images).

Figure 4. The apical bronchial epithelia lumen contains infected cells that transmit infection. A: A
schematic of the experimental design (top panel). Apical washes at 4 days post-infection were fixed
and concentrated on slides using cytospin (bottom panel) and stained with anti-N antibodies to
detect infected cells (green signal) and anti-cytokeratin 5 marking basal cells (magenta signal) and
counterstained with DAPI (grey signal). Arrows indicate syncytia in the overview and are magnified
to the left. The boxed inset is magnified and individual syncytia are indicated by the orange arrows.
Scale bar is 10µm. B. A schematic of the experimental design (top panel). Apical washes were
separated into supernatant and cell pellet and used to infect Vero E6 cells. CPE was quantified at
96h post-infection using fluorescence readout as described in material and methods (Bottom
panel).

Figure 5. SARS-CoV-2 infection of bronchial epithelia (BE) in children. A: Overview of entire BE
from children and adult control. Donor are as listed in table 1 (C = child, A = adult control) and days
post-infection is indicated on the top. BE were stained with anti-N antibodies to detect infected cells
(green signal) and anti-cytokeratin 5 marking basal cells (magenta signal). B: High resolution
imaging of the Child C1 epithelia 7 days post-infection. Epithelia were stained with anti-N antibodies
to detect infected cells (green signal) and anti-cytokeratin 5 marking basal cells (magenta signal).
The boxed area containing an infection foci is magnified to the right. The higher magnification
shows the infection front (dashed line and white arrows) and individual infected cells in the vicinity
of the infection front (orange arrows). C: High resolution imaging of the Child C2 epithelia 4 days
post-infection. Epithelia were stained with anti-N antibodies to detect infected cells (green signal)
and anti-cytokeratin 5 marking basal cells (magenta signal) and counterstained with DAPi (grey or
blue signal). The white arrow in the overview points at a syncytium that is further magnified as
maximum Z-projection (left panel) or individual Z-stack (right panel with phalloidin counterstain in
red), or as 3D image reconstruction to see its apical location. Scale bar is 10µm, 50µm, 200µm
respectively. See also movie S9. D: The absolute number of N-positive cells throughout the BE
was estimated for three children donor (C1-3) and one adult control (A6). Color code as indicated.
E: The average size of N-positive signals from (D) was determined for two child epithelia (C1 and
C2) and one adult control (A6) at 3 and 4 days post-infection as indicated. F: Apical washes for
each BE were subject to RT-qPCR analysis to determine genome copy numbers at day 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 7 post-infection as indicated. Color code same as in (D). G: Basolateral supernatant from adults
(black, n=4) and children (red, n=3) BE were subject to ELISA to determine interferon l
concentration at day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-infection as indicated. Results are presented as mean
± SEM and * indicates significant difference between adults and children for a time point using
Mann Whitney t test.

Figure S1. Characterization of bronchial epithelia (BE). A: Schematic overview of BE generation.
Basal cells extracted from surgical dissection or bronchial brushing were expanded and
differentiated at the air-liquid interface. B: Differentiated BE were stained with anti-acetylated
tubulin to identify ciliated epithelia cells (green signal) or anti-Muc5A to detect cells (pink signal)
and counterstained with DAPI (grey in top image, blue in bottom image). Top image shows a Zprojection, the bottom image shows an individual Z-section of a 3D reconstruction counterstained
with phalloidin to detect the cell morphology via the actin cell cortex (red signal). Scale bar is 10µm.
Note that ciliated cells are located to the apical side (see movie S1 for 3D). C: As in B but the
differentiated BE was stained with with anti-acetylated tubulin (green signal) or anti-cytokeratin 5
to detect basal cells (pink signal) and counterstained with DAPI. Scale bar is 10µm. (see movie S2
for 3D). D: Electron microscopy of fully differentiated BE. The overview (a) shows ciliated epithelia
cells (black asterisk) and goblet cells (white asterisk). The magnified images show tight junctions
(b) marked by arrows and cilia either as cross-section (c) or longitudinal section (d). Scale bars are
indicated. E: As in B but the differentiated BE was stained with with anti-acetylated tubulin (green
signal) or anti-ACE2 to detect the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (pink signal) and counterstained with
DAPI. Note that arrows point at individual cilia with ACE2 signal. Scale bar is 10µm. (see movie S2
for 3D).

Figure S3. SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetic of bronchial epithelia (BE) from children and adult donor.
A: Representative widefield microscopy images of BE from one adult donor and three children (A6
top left, C1 top right, C2 bottom left and C3 bottom right) at low resolution. BE were fixed at day 1,
2, 3, 4, 7 as indicated to the left of each row, non-infected controls were also fixed at day 7. BE
were stained with anti-N antibodies to detect infected cells (green signal first column), anticytokeratin 5 to detect basal cells (magenta signal, second column) and counterstained with DAPI
(grey signal, third column) and a merge of the three signals (forth column). Note the slow virus
spread in the children derived epithelia. Scale bar is 10µm
