Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has impacted public
health, society and economy and the daily lives of billions of people in an unprecedented manner.
There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while
better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug
suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of ~20 µM, which is well
below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3
logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of
addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle,
possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin
also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further
investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19
patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.

Introduction
In December 2019, local health authorities reported an increasing number of pneumonia cases, rapidly
spreading across the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, in China (1). Further analysis showed that the
causative agent of this disease was SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a member of the
betacoronavirus genus within the coronavirus family and shares roughly 80% of genetic identity with
SARS-CoV (2, 3). Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 113 countries, leading to a coronavirus
pandemic of unprecedented magnitude, with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases globally and more
than 240,000 casualties reported by WHO on May 5th, 2020 (4).
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, that possess extraordinarily large (26 to 32 kb) positive-strand
RNA genomes (5). SARS-CoV-2 infection often causes only mild disease, but can also lead to clinical
manifestations such as high fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and headache. Although the majority of
cases may be asymptomatic or present mild symptoms with good recovery, some patients develop
more severe outcomes, such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure or death
(6).
Due to the urgency of the situation, the lack of approved specific antiviral therapy against
coronaviruses and the time it takes to develop the latter through regular preclinical and clinical
research, there is great interest in repurposing already approved drugs. This would be a fast track to
apply candidate therapeutic agents as antivirals to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be used
to fight the virus while better and more specific antivirals are being developed.
Drugs like ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir and the anti-malarial therapeutic chloroquine showed
promise in cell culture and some also appeared to show (modest) effects in early trials in humans,
which were not always conducted with the most optimal design (7). However, except for remdesivir
(8) more recent (and more appropriately conducted) clinical trials suggest that none of these drugs
provide substantial benefit in patients and that they should be used with caution due to their potential
side-effects. Therefore, it appears that options to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited and mainly
supportive care and treatments that target the immune system and inflammatory responses can be
provided to patients. This stresses the urgency of evaluating additional approved drugs as candidates
for use as antiviral therapy against this pathogen.
We now provide evidence showing that suramin can be considered as drug candidate that deserves
further assessment, as we found the compound to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in
relevant cell culture models at concentrations that can be easily reached in human serum. Suramin is
an anti-parasitic drug that is used to treat sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes. It is a
symmetrical polysulfonated compound that was synthesized for the first time around 1916 (9). Later
we and many others have shown that suramin also has broad-spectrum antiviral effects, as it inhibits
HIV (10), hepatitis C virus (11), herpes simplex type-1 virus (12), Zika virus (13), dengue virus (14),
chikungunya virus (15), and others.
In the present study, we show that suramin also exhibits antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell
culture, most likely by inhibiting viral entry. The compound had an EC50 of 20 µM in Vero E6 cells and
showed a more than 2 log viral load reduction when infected human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells
were treated. Finally, suramin reduced SARS-CoV-2 progression of infection in well-differentiated
primary human airway epithelial cells cultured at the physiological air-liquid interface. It is important
to stress that these results should not be directly translated to efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in humans
and guarantee no benefit to the patient yet. However, our results make suramin an interesting
candidate to further evaluate in in-depth pre-clinical studies (e.g. into formulation, mode of
administration, pharmacokinetics and in other ex vivo models) and suggest suramin could be explored
in carefully performed and properly controlled clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Material and Methods
Cell lines, virus and compound
Vero E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Lonza), supplemented
with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin and 100 µg/ml of
streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 2B4 (referred to as Calu-3
cells) was maintained as described (16). Primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures were
established at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC; Department of Pulmonology) and their
culture and infection are described below. All cell cultures were maintained at 37oC in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 95%–99% humidity. Infections were performed in Eagle’s minimal essential medium
(EMEM; Lonza) with 25 mM HEPES (Lonza), further supplemented with 2% FCS, L-glutamine (SigmaAldrich), and antibiotics.
The clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2/Leiden-002 was isolated from a nasopharyngeal sample at LUMC and
its sequence and characterization will be described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). SARS-CoV2/Leiden-002 was passaged twice in Vero E6 cells and virus titers were determined by plaque assay as
described before (17). Working stocks yielded titers of 5 x 106 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. All
experiments with infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level 3 facility at the LUMC.
Suramin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was dissolved in milliQ and stored at -20°C. Addition
of compound to Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells was done in infection medium and in PBS for HAE cultures.
Human airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE)
HAE cell cultures were cultured as previously described (18). Briefly, primary human bronchial
epithelial cells were isolated from tumour-free resected bronchial tissue from patients undergoing
resection surgery for lung cancer at the LUMC. Use of such lung tissue that became available for
research within the framework of patient care was in line with the “Human Tissue and Medical
Research Code of conduct for responsible use” (2011) (www.federa.org), which describes the opt-out
system for coded anonymous further use of such tissue. To achieve mucociliary differentiation, PBEC
were cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) for 21 days as previously described (18, 19). In brief,
expanded HAE cells from 3 donors at passage 2 were combined (3 x 104 cells per donor) and were
seeded on 12-well transwell membranes (Corning Costar), which were coated with a mixture of BSA,
collagen type 1, and fibronectin. In addition, cells from two individual donors were seeded on separate
sets of transwell membranes. BEpiCM-b:DMEM (B/D)-medium (1:1) was used as described
(supplemented with 12.5mM HEPES, bronchial epithelial cell growth supplement, antibiotics, 1 nM
EC23 (retinoic acid receptor agonist), and 2 mM glutaMAX). After confluence was reached, cells were
cultured at the ALI in complete medium with 50 nM EC23 for 21 days. The mucociliary differentiated
cultures were characterized by a high trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER>500 Ω∙cm2), visible
cilia beating and mucus production. Before infection, cells were incubated overnight in the BEpiCMb/DMEM 1:1 medium mixture from which EGF, BPE, BSA and hydrocortisone were omitted and that
did contain antibiotics (starvation medium).
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
RNA was isolated from cell culture supernatants and cell lysates using the TriPure Isolation Reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich). Equine arteritis virus (EAV) in AVL lysis buffer (Qiagen) was spiked into the reagent as
internal control for extracellular RNA samples. The cellular household gene PGK-1 served as control
for intracellular RNA. Primers and probes for EAV and PGK1 and the normalization procedure were
described before (20). Viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR using the TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step
Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers and probes were based on (21) but with modifications
resulting in the following primer and probe sequences: SARS-CoV-2 N-Gene FwdCACATTGGCACCCGCAATC,

containing the RT-qPCR target sequences was used for absolute quantification. A RT-qPCR program of
5 min at 50 °C and 20 s at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C, was performed
on a CFX384 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
Cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay
CPE reduction assays were performed as described (22). Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well
cell culture plates at a density of 104 cells per well. Cells were incubated with 1.7-fold serial dilutions
of suramin starting from a concentration of 120 µM. Subsequently, cells were either mock-infected
(analysis of cytotoxicity of the compound) or were infected with 300 PFU of virus per well (MOI of
0.015) in a total volume of 150 µl of medium. Cell viability was assessed three days post-infection by
MTS assay using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation kit (Promega) and
absorption was measured at 495 nm with an EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). The 50%
effective concentration (EC50), required to inhibit virus-induced cell death by 50%, and the 50%
cytotoxic concentration (CC50), that reduces the viability of uninfected cells to 50% of that of untreated
control cells, were determined using non-linear regression with GraphPad Prism v8.0.
Viral load reduction assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates at a density of 104 (Vero E6) or 6 x 104 (Calu-3) cells per
well in 100 µl culture medium. As control to determine the amount of residual virus after removal of
the inoculum and washing, cells in some wells were killed with 70% Ethanol (followed by washing with
PBS). Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells were incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of a starting concentration
of 200 µM of suramin and subsequently infected with 2 x 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 1 on Vero E6
cells). For analysis of viral RNA, supernatant was harvested from Vero E6 cells at 16 h.p.i and from
Calu-3 cells at 21 h.p.i. Intracellular RNA was collected by lysing the cells in 150 µl Tripure reagent.
Analysis of viral progeny in supernatant from Calu-3 cells was performed by plaque assay on Vero E6
cells (17). Potential cytotoxicity of the compound was tested in parallel on uninfected cells using the
MTS assay (Promega) as described for the CPE reduction assay.
Entry inhibition plaque reduction assay
A day before infection Vero E6 cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates at a density of 3.5 x 105
cells per well in 2 ml medium. 10-2 to 10-5-fold serial dilutions of a SARS-COV-2 stock were prepared in
medium containing 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 or 0 µM suramin. These were used as inoculum to infect
the Vero E6 cells in 6-well clusters. After 1 h at 37oC, the inoculum was removed and cells were
incubated in Avicel-containing overlay medium without suramin for 3 days, after which they were
fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with crystal violet and plaques were counted (17).
Time of addition assay
Vero E6 cells were seeded in 24-well clusters at a density of 6 x 104 cells per well. The next day cells
were treated with 100 µM suramin during the time intervals indicated in Fig. 3 and they were infected
at an MOI of 1. Supernatant was harvested at 10 h.p.i. for quantification of viral RNA by RT-qPCR.
Infection and suramin treatment of HAE cells
The apical sides of HAE cell cultures were washed 3 times with 200 µl PBS for 10 min at 37oC on the
day before infection to remove excess mucus. Washing was repeated once before cells were infected
on the apical side with 3 x 104 PFU SARS-CoV-2 (estimated MOI of 0.1) in 200 µl of PBS. The apical side
was treated with 100 µM suramin in 50 µl of PBS at 12 and 24 h.p.i (after first collecting a 200 µl PBS
wash to determine viral load). Control wells were treated with 50 µl of PBS. The experiment was done
in triplicate, with one insert (transwell) containing a mix of cells from 3 donors and two 'single donor'
inserts seeded with cells from two different donors. Supernatants were collected from infected PBStreated cells and infected suramin-treated cells at 12, 24 and 48 h.p.i, by incubating the apical side
with 200 µl PBS for 10 min at 37oC and collecting it. This supernatant was used for quantification of

cytotoxicity of the 48h suramin treatment, compared to PBS treatment, was done with uninfected

Results
Suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells
To determine if suramin could protect cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its toxicity,
Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with serial dilutions of suramin in a CPE
reduction assay. Suramin protected infected cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death in a dosedependent manner, with an EC50 of 20 ± 2,7 µM (Fig. 1A). In parallel, non-infected cells were treated
with the same concentrations of suramin in order to assess the compound’s toxicity. No toxicity was
observed over the range of concentrations that was used in these antiviral assays. Only at 5 mM cell
viability dropped to 67%, resulting in a CC50 > 5 mM (15). Therefore, suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with
a selectivity index (SI) higher than 250.
To more directly measure the inhibition of viral replication by suramin, viral load reduction assays
were performed. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 and they were treated
with increasing concentrations of suramin. At 16 h.p.i., supernatant was harvested to determine the
viral load by quantifying the levels of extracellular viral RNA by RT-qPCR (Fig 1B). The supernatant of
untreated infected cells contained 1011 copies/ml of viral RNA. RT-qPCR revealed that the RNA levels
decreased upon suramin treatment in a dose-dependent manner, showing a 3-log reduction at the
highest concentration tested (200 µM) (Fig. 1B). Together, these results indicated that suramin
protects Vero E6 cells from the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect and that it reduces the viral load
in these cells.

Suramin reduces the viral RNA and infectious virus load in cultured human lung epithelial cells
To assess the antiviral effect of suramin in a more relevant model, human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3)
were infected with 2 x 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of 0-200 µM suramin for 1h. After
removal of the inoculum and washing of the cells, incubation was continued in medium with suramin
(0-200 µM) for 20 hours. At 21 h.p.i., RNA was isolated from cells and supernatant and the viral titer
in the supernatant was determined by plaque assay. We observed a strong dose-dependent reduction
in intracellular (Fig. 2A) and extracellular (Fig. 2B) viral RNA levels in suramin-treated samples. At 200
µM the extracellular viral RNA levels showed a 3-log reduction, while intracellular viral RNA levels
decreased by 2-log. Figures 2A and 2B show the results of RT-qPCR reactions targeting the RNAdependent RNA polymerase coding region, but similar reductions in copy numbers were observed
with RT-qPCR reactions targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N protein gene (also detects subgenomic RNA),
although in that case absolute copy numbers -as expected- were higher than for genomic RNA (data
not shown). Plaque assays confirmed that treatment with 200 µM suramin led to an almost 3-log drop
in infectious progeny titers from infected-Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2C).
Cytotoxicity assays performed in parallel in non-infected Calu-3 cells showed that suramin was slightly
more toxic to these cells than to Vero E6 cells, although cell viability remained above 80% even at the
highest dose tested (Fig. 2D). Together these results suggest that suramin is a potent SARS-CoV-2
inhibitor with high selectivity, also in human lung cells.

Suramin acts on the early steps of viral replication
To determine which step of viral replication is affected by suramin, we performed a time-of-addition
assay. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 1) and treated with 100 µM of suramin over different
time intervals, as schematically depicted in Figure 3A. Treatment was initiated 1 hour before infection
or at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 or 8 h.p.i., and suramin remained present until 10 h.p.i., when supernatants were
harvested to determine viral load by RT-qPCR targeting the RdRp coding region. In one sample suramin
was only present for 60 min during the time of infection. After 1 hour, virus inoculum was removed
and cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation in medium with or without
suramin. At 10 h.p.i., supernatant was collected to evaluate the levels of viral RNA (Fig. 3B). When
suramin treatment was initiated 1 hour before (-1h) or at the time of infection (0h) a 2-log reduction
in viral RNA levels was observed. Treatments that started later than 1 hour post infection did not
inhibit viral replication, as viral RNA levels similar to the non-treated control were observed.
Treatment only during the infection (0-1h) resulted in the same 2-log reduction in viral RNA load as
the 0-10h treatment, indicating that suramin inhibits an early step of the replication cycle, likely viral
entry.
To confirm suramin's inhibitory effect on entry, we performed a plaque reduction assay, by infecting
Vero E6 cells with serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of
suramin, which was only present during the one hour of infection. After infection, cells were washed
3 times with PBS and were incubated with overlay medium without suramin. After 3 days, cells were
fixed, stained and plaques were counted. Suramin caused a dose-dependent reduction in the number
of plaques and even at the lowest suramin concentration (12.5 µM) titers were already reduced by
almost one log (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry.

Suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in a primary human epithelial airway cell infection model
Primary human airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE) mimic the morphological and physiological
features of the human conducting airway, arguably being the most relevant ex vivo model for human
coronavirus research (23-25). For that reason, we decided to also evaluate the antiviral effect of
suramin in this model. HAE were differentiated by culture at the air-liquid interface to achieve
mucociliary differentiation, and were infected for one hour with 30,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (estimated
MOI of 0.1 based on the number of cells present on an insert), followed by washing with PBS. At 12
and 24 h.p.i., the cultures were treated on the apical side with either 50 µl of 100 µM suramin or 50
µl PBS. The HAE apical side was washed with PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C, and this supernatant was
harvested at 12, 24 and 48 h.p.i. to analyze the viral load by RT-qPCR. RNA was also isolated from cells
to quantify the levels of intracellular viral RNA and the housekeeping gene PGK1. RT-qPCR analysis of
extracellular viral RNA levels showed that after infection approximately 107 copies/ml of viral RNA
remained at 1 h.p.i.. The viral load in the supernatant did not increase significantly at 12 and 24 h.p.i.
in untreated cells, while at 48h a more than 1 log increase in viral RNA copies was observed. This is
indicative of (very modest) viral replication in PBS-treated cells. The cultures that were treated with
suramin displayed no increase in viral load in the supernatant, but rather even a slight decrease in
copy numbers, suggesting viral replication did not progress in treated cells. At 48 h.p.i. the supernatant
of suramin-treated cells showed 2-log lower SARS-CoV-2 released genome copy numbers than PBStreated control cells (Fig. 4A). The levels of intracellular viral RNA displayed the same trend, with a
decrease in viral RNA in suramin-treated samples compared to an increase in viral RNA in PBS-treated
samples (Fig. 4B). A 1-log difference, from 106 to 105 copies per transwell was observed at 48 h.p.i.
between suramin-and PBS-treated cells (Fig. 4B). The levels of the housekeeping gene, PGK1 remained
stable in all samples, suggesting the reduction in viral RNA copies was not due to cell death. Moreover,
cell viability measured by MTS assay (Fig. 4C) and LDH assay (data not shown), suggested suramin
treatment (compared to PBS treatment) had no measurable cytotoxic effect on HAE cells. To
determine the effect of suramin on infectious progeny released by HAE cells, we performed a plaque
assay with the harvested supernatant. At 24 h.p.i., a modest difference was observed between the
infectious progeny released by PBS (3.3 x 103 PFU/ml) and suramin-treated cells (4.4 x 102 PFU/ml).
At 48 h.p.i., the supernatant of PBS-treated cells contained over 104 PFU/ml, while no infectious virus
was found in suramin-treated samples (Limit of detection 100 PFU/ml). This suggests that suramin
reduces the progression of infection in a HAE culture infection model.

Discussion
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its enormous impact on public health, society, economy and the
lives of billions around the globe has prompted a multitude of efforts to develop vaccines and
antivirals. Due to the lengthy development process of new and specific antivirals, there is a particular
interest in repurposing existing drugs for treatment of the COVID-19 disease. This could provide a
temporary solution, while better and more specific drugs are being developed. Several small-molecule
compounds like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir or remdesivir have been showing some
efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (26). However, despite promising results in preclinical studies,
recent clinical trials (27, 28) suggested that these compounds, with the exception of remdesivir (8), do
not provide much benefit to COVID-19 patients and could actually be dangerous due to possible sideeffects. This leaves us currently empty-handed and in search for other approved drugs that might be
repurposed. As an already approved antiparasitic drug, suramin would be one of the candidates for
fast development of a treatment for COVID-19. Antiviral activity of suramin against RNA viruses was
reported earlier by us and several other groups (15, 29-31) and the compound was and is also being
evaluated in several clinical trials for other diseases, providing some evidence for its safety for
therapeutic use. However, suramin can also cause several side-effects, which caused previous HIV
trials with seriously ill patients to halt (32) and therefore caution is advised and it is crucial to conduct
well controlled randomized trials, before any conclusions on possible benefits for COVID-19 patients
can be drawn. Thus far, no studies have reported about a potential antiviral effect of suramin against
coronaviruses.
In this study we assessed the antiviral activity of suramin against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.
Suramin offered full protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death in Vero E6 cells and inhibited
the virus with an EC50 of 20 µM and a SI of >250 (Fig. 1). Suramin treatment of infected Vero E6 cells
led to a reduction in extracellular viral RNA levels of up to 3 log. The highest concentration of
compound that was used proved harmless to the cells and also previously cytotoxicity was only
observed above 5 mM (15). Suramin also displayed antiviral efficacy in a human lung epithelial cell
line and we observed a >2 log reduction in infectious virus progeny in suramin-treated cells.

Suramin was previously described to have the potential to inhibit several stages of virus replication by
acting on different targets (15, 33). To assess which step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle is affected
by suramin treatment, we performed a time-of-addition assay. We observed that pre-treatment with
suramin as well as addition during the first hour of infection resulted in a marked decrease of viral
RNA in the supernatant, while treatments initiated after the first hour of infection showed no
significant effect on virus replication, suggesting that suramin inhibits binding or entry. In addition,
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was decreased in plaque assays, when suramin was present only in the
inoculum during infection, concordant with an effect on the early stages of infection (Fig. 3). This is in
agreement with other studies that also reported on the inhibition of virus binding or entry by suramin
(15, 30, 34). Our data suggest that the antiviral effect of suramin is primarily due to inhibition of
binding and/or fusion.
Finally we evaluated the effect of suramin in a more relevant model of differentiated primary human
airway epithelial (HAE) cells cultured and infected at the physiologically relevant air-liquid interface.
We infected these cells with a relatively low dose of virus (estimated MOI of 0.1) and treated them
with suramin by applying a 50 µl volume of 100 µM of suramin on the apical side at 12 and 24 h.p.i.
This would allow us to follow spread of the viral infection and assess whether suramin is able to block
progression of infection in this 'treatment model'. HAE cell cultures are a composition of highly
differentiated cells mainly containing basal, goblet, club and ciliated cells, hence representing an airliquid interface that is mimicking the lung airway epithelium (35, 36). In a recent study, it was shown
that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for
attachment in these human airway cells. Blocking of the host protease TMPRSS2, which is important
for priming the fusion activity of the spike protein, also inhibited infection in lung cells (37). To address
the variation of these proteins and the diversity of primary human airway cells within patients, we
made use of HAE cultures that were obtained from different donors. Notably, we could observe
differences in the susceptibility of cultures from different donors, in which HAE cultures from mixed
donors showed higher titers. HAE cultures might have varying susceptibility to infection, possibly
caused by a difference in cell differentiation and composition (38).
Administration of 100 µM of suramin on the apical side of the HAE cells did not appear to cause
cytotoxic effects in our study (Fig. 4). In our HAE model for progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
infected cells at a low MOI and observed a modest (~200-fold) increase in viral load by 48 h.p.i. in PBStreated cultures. Although the increase in viral load was rather modest in control cells, we found no
evidence for progression of the infection in suramin-treated cultures, as indicated by SARS-CoV-2 RNA
levels that remained equal to that at 1 h.p.i. or even decreased over time. Moreover, the infectious
progeny titer increased over time in PBS-treated HAE cultures and reached over 104 PFU/ml by 48
h.p.i, while in suramin-treated HAE cells, infectious progeny showed a modest increase at 24 h.p.i. (10
fold lower than PBS-treated cells) and dropped to undetectable levels at 48 h.p.i. Since suramincontaining samples needed to be diluted by a 100-fold to exclude interference with the plaque assay,
the limit of detection would be 100 pfu/ml. Even with this limit of detection, the supernatant collected
from suramin-treated HAE cells contains at least 100 times less virus than that from PBS-treated cells.
Much higher titers were obtained with HAE cultures from mixed donors than from single donors, but
the inhibitory effect of suramin was also observed with single donor cultures. Overall, despite the
modest level of infection in control cells, our results suggest that also in the HAE infection model,
suramin has an inhibitory effect on progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Our study demonstrates that suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in various cell culture models
and at clinically achievable concentrations (after IV administration serum levels of >10x the EC50 could
be achieved). Due to its mode of action (inhibition of entry) treatment of patients with suramin might
require administration at an early stage, although it might also prevent spread of the virus in the lungs
of already symptomatic patients or could prevent spread from respiratory tract to other organs. It
might possibly even be used to prevent virus spreading in the nasopharynx, which appears to be the
first site of infection (39-41). Standard treatment with suramin is done by intravenous administration,
which would also be an option for seriously ill COVID-19 patients that are in intensive care, but is not

ideal for other patients. As a negatively charged compound, suramin binds to various proteins and is
poorly taken up by diffusion across the cell membrane, although it can be taken up by endocytosis
(33). This poor uptake of suramin into cells might not necessarily be a problem for the efficacy against
SARS-CoV-2, as it is expected to block the virus systemically and in the extracellular environment.
Hypothetically, suramin administration into the respiratory tract in an aerosolized form could be even
considered, although this requires new safety studies.
In conclusion, our preclinical study shows that suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture,
likely by preventing entry. Suramin also appears to prevent progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a
human airway epithelial cell culture model. This is only the first step towards evaluating whether
suramin treatment could provide any benefit to COVID-19 patients. Further studies should carefully
evaluate different formulations, routes of administration, pharmacokinetics, and possible adverse
effects in cell culture and ex vivo models. Ultimately, the clinical benefits of suramin for the treatment
of COVID-19 patients should be evaluated in carefully performed and properly controlled clinical trials.
