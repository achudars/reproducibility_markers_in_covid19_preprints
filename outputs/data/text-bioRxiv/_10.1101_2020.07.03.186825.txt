The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, calls for the
urgent development of a vaccine. The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible
antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics
simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length,
fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity,
sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S
and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and
inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures,
highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has emerged as the most challenging global health crisis within a century [1]. As such,
the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs effective
against SARS-CoV-2 is absolutely urgent. As for other
enveloped viruses [2], the primary vaccine target is the
trimeric spike (S) protein in the envelope of SARS-CoV2. S mediates viral entry into the target cell [3–7]. After
binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor, the ectodomain of S undergoes a drastic transition from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation. This transition drives the fusion between viral and
host membranes, which triggers internalization of SARSCoV-2 via endocytic and possibly non-endocytic pathways [8, 9]. Locking the conformation of S or blocking
its interaction with ACE2 would prevent cell entry and
infection. However, the dense glycan coat of S effectively
shields the virus from an immune response and hinders
pharmacological targeting.
A detailed understanding of the exposed viral surface
is instrumental in vaccine design [10]. Thanks to the extraordinary response of the global scientific community,
we already have atomistic structures of S [6, 7, 11, 12] and
detailed views of the viral envelope [13–16]. However,
static structures do not capture conformational changes
of S or the motion of the highly dynamic glycans covering it. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations add a
dynamic picture of S and its glycan protective shield [17–
19]. Intriguingly, Amaro’s group predicted that glycans
also play a crucial role in the infection mechanism [18].
Recent experiments validated these results [20], confirming the potential of accurate atomistic models.

Here, we report on the ˜2 µs-long MD simulation of a
full-length atomistic model of four S trimers in the prefusion conformation, giving us in aggregate ˜8 µs of S
dynamics. The model includes the transmembrane domain (TMD) embedded in a realistic membrane, along
with realistic post-translational modification patterns,
i.e., glycosylation of the ectodomain and palmitoylation
of the TMD. Although independently developed, our S
protein model and its structural dynamics are in quantitative agreement with recent high-resolution electron
cryo-tomography (cryoET) images [15].
We identify possible immunogenic epitopes on SARSCoV-2 S by combining information on steric accessibility
and structural flexibility with bioinformatic assessments
of sequence conservation and epitope characteristics. We
recover known epitopes in the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and identify several epitope candidates on
the spike surface that are exposed, structured, and conserved in sequence. In particular, target sites for antibodies emerge in the functionally important S2 domain
harboring the fusion machinery. We propose the structural domains presenting these epitopes as possible immunogens.
METHODS

Full-length molecular model of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. Our simulation system contained four
membrane-embedded SARS-CoV-2 S proteins assembled
from resolved structures where available and models for
the missing parts (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The spike head
was modeled based on a recently determined structure
(PDB ID: 6VSB[6]) with one RBD domain in an open
conformation and glycans modeled according to [21]. The
stalk connecting the S head to the membrane was modeled de novo as trimeric coiled coils, consistent with an
experimental structure of the HR2 domain in SARS-CoV
S (PDB ID: 2FXP[22]). The TMD as well as the cytosolic

domain were modeled de novo. See SI Appendix, supplementary methods for further details and SI Appendix,
Fig. S6 for a view of the final model.
Molecular dynamics simulations. We assembled four
membrane-embedded full-length S proteins to form one
large membrane patch with proteins spaced at about
15 nm distance [23, 24], totaling ˜4.1 million atoms in the
system. We performed MD simulations of the four S proteins for 1.93 µs in the NpT ensemble with GROMACS
2019.6 [25]. We used the CHARMM36m protein and glycan force fields [26–28], in combination with the TIP3P
water model, and sodium and chloride ions (150 mM).
Rigidity analysis. We quantified the local rigidity in
terms of RMSF values. For each frame, the Cα atoms
of residues within 15 Å of the residue of interest were
rigid-body aligned to the average structure. The RMSF
values were then averaged over the Cα atoms, weighted
by the relative surface area of each residue [29]. These
flexibility profiles were averaged over the four spike copies
and three chains. The local rigidity was then defined as
the reciprocal of the flexibility.
Accessibility analysis. The accessibility of the S protein surfaces was probed by illuminating the simulation
protein in diffuse light, as detailed below, and by rigid
body docking of the Fab of the antibody CR3022 [30], as
detailed in the SI Appendix. For the illumination analysis, rays of random orientation emanate from a halfsphere with radius 25 nm around the center of mass of
the protein. They are absorbed by the first heavy atom
they pass within 1.5 Å.
Simulation structures collected at 10 ns intervals were
each probed with 106 rays. To quantify the effect of glycosylation, the analysis was performed with and without
including the glycan shield. The fraction of rays absorbed
was used as one measure of accessibility, and possible
contact with an Fab (SI Appendix) as the other.
Sequence variability analysis. To estimate the evolutionary variability of the S protein, we analyzed the
aligned amino acid sequences released by the GISAID
initiative on 25 May 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/).
We first built the consensus sequence with the most common amino acid (the mode) at each position across the
whole data set. We then kept only 1273 amino acid long
sequences, and filtered out corrupted sequences by discarding those having a Hamming distance from the consensus larger than 0.2. With the remaining 30,426 sequences, we estimated the conservation at each position
[31]. Our conservation score is defined as the normalized
difference between the maximum possible entropy and
the entropy of the observed amino
P acid distribution at a
given position, cons (i) = 1 + k pk (i) log pk (i) / log 20,
where pk (i) is the probability of observing amino acid k
at position i in the sequence.

predictions. We
estimated
the

prediction by using the BepiPred 2.0 webserver
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/),
with an Epitope Threshold of 0.5 [32].
BepiPred

2.0 uses a random forest model trained on known
epitope-antibody complexes.
Consensus score for epitope prediction. We integrated the information of the different analyses into the
consensus epitope score. We first applied a 3D Gaussian
filter with σ = 5 Å to the ray and docking scores . We
then mapped each score to the interval [0, 1], with outliers
mapped to the extremes listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.
Finally, we multiplied the individual scores together to
obtain the consensus score, which was also mapped to
[0, 1].

RESULTS
Model of full-length S

As basis for our search for possible epitopes, we constructed a detailed structural model of glycosylated fulllength S. Whereas high-resolution structures of the S
head are available [6, 7], the stalk and membrane anchor have so far not been resolved at atomic level. Moreover, the glycosylation partially resolved in the S head
structures may differ from that under infection conditions because of its passage through an intact Golgi in
the expression system [15].
We built a model of the complete S by combining experimental structural data and bioinformatic predictions.
Our full-length model of the S trimer consists of the
large ectodomain (residues 1-1137) forming the head, two
coiled-coil domains, denoted CC1 (residues 1138-1158)
and HR2 (residues 1167-1204), forming the stalk, the
α-helical TMD (residues 1212-1237) with flanking amphipathic helices (1243-1255) and multiple palmitoylated
cysteines, and a short C-terminal domain (residues 12561273). The model fits high-resolution cryoET electron
density data of S proteins on the surface of virions extracted from a culture of infected cells remarkably well
[15].

Multi-microsecond atomistic MD simulations reveal
dynamics of S and its glycan shield

We performed a ˜2 µs long atomistic MD simulation
of a viral membrane patch with four flexible S proteins, embedded at a distance of about 15 nm [23, 24]
(Fig. 1). During the simulation, the four S proteins remained folded and anchored in the membrane with wellseparated TMDs. The S heads tilted dynamically and
interacted with their neighbors (SI Appendix, Movie S1).
High-resolution cryoET images [15] and a recent MD
study [18] independently revealed significant head tilting associated with flexing of the joints in the stalk, in
strong support of our observations. Being highly mobile,
the glycans on the surface of S cover most of its surface
(Fig. 2A-C ).

Antibody binding sites predicted from accessibility,
rigidity, sequence conservation, and sequence
signature

Accessibility of the S ectodomain. Antibody binding
requires at least transient access to epitopes. The general
accessibility of S on the viral membrane and the surface
coverage by glycans was extracted from the MD simulations by (1) ray and (2) antigen-binding fragment (Fab)

docking analyses. In the ray analysis, we illuminated the
protein model by diffuse light; in the Fab docking analysis, we performed rigid body Monte Carlo simulations
of S and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody CR3022 Fab to determine the steric accessibility to an antibody Fab. To
account for protein and glycan mobility, we performed
both analyses individually for 4 × 193 snapshots taken at
10 ns time intervals from the 1.93 µs MD simulation with
four glycosylated S proteins.
The glycan shield dramatically reduces the accessibility to the S surface (Fig. 3A,B ). Ray accessibility
time traces show that the accessibility of a given site
varies considerably in time (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Even
though glycans cover only a small fraction of the protein
surface at a given moment (Fig. 1), their high mobility
leads to a strong effective shielding of S (Fig. 2). A comparison of the Fab docking results for glycosylated and
unglycosylated S further illustrates this effect (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Ray and docking analyses show that
glycans cause a reduction in accessibility by about 35%
and 80%, respectively. The most marked effect occurs
in the HR2 coiled coil close to the membrane. Without
glycosylation, HR2 is fully accessible; with glycosylation,
HR2 becomes inaccessible to Fab docking (Fig. 4A,B ).
Whereas small molecules may interact with the HR2 protein stalk, antibodies are blocked from surface access, in
agreement with recent simulations by Casalino et al. [18].
Rigidity of S. Structured epitopes are expected to
bind strongly and specifically to antibodies. By contrast,
mobile regions tend to become structured in the bound
state, entailing a loss in entropy and may not retain their
structure when presented in a vaccine construct. With
the aim of eliciting a robust immune response, we chose
to include rigidity in our epitope score. Here, we are
less concerned with the large-scale conformational dynamics associated with the flexible hinges in the stalk
and membrane anchor, as analyzed in another paper [15].
Instead, we concentrate on motions of domains on the
scale of about 1 nm. For this, we determined the rootmean-square fluctuations (RMSF) locally by superimposing local protein regions and converting the RMSF into
a rigidity score, as described in Methods.
The surface of S presents both dynamic and rigid regions (Fig. 4C ). Interestingly, the RBD and its surrounding are comparably flexible, consistent with the experimental finding of large differences in the structure of the
three peptide chains in open and closed states [7]. By
contrast, the protein surface of the S2 domain covering
the fusion machinery is relatively rigid (Fig. 4C ), possibly to safeguard this functionally critical domain in the
metastable prefusion conformation.
Sequence conservation. Targeting epitopes whose sequences are highly conserved will ensure efficacy across
strains and prevent the virus from escaping immune pressure through mutations with minimal fitness penalty. We
estimated the sequence conservation from the naturally
occurring variations at each amino acid position in the
sequences collected and curated by the GISAID initiative

(https://www.gisaid.org/). The analysis of 30,426 amino
acid sequences revealed that S is highly conserved, with
no mutation recorded for 52% of the amino acid positions.
As conservation score, we mapped the entropy at each
position to the interval between zero and one (see Methods). Even surface regions are mostly well conserved in
sequence (Fig. 4D).
Sequence-based
immunogenicity
predictor. Conserved, rigid, and accessible regions present good
candidates for binding of protein partners in general. To
complement this information, we assessed the immunogenic potential based on sequence signatures targeted
by antibodies. The epitope-like motifs in the S sequence
identified using the BepiPred 2.0 server [32] lie scattered
across the S ectodomain and include known epitopes
(Fig. 3E and Fig. 4E ), but also contain buried regions
inaccessible to antibodies.
Consensus epitope score. We combined our accessibility, rigidity, conservation, and immunogenicity scores
into a single consensus epitope score (Figs. 3F and 4F ).
By taking the product of all individual scores, we ensured that epitope candidates have high scores in all features. This rigorous requirement eliminates many candidate sites, mostly because accessibility scores (Fig. 4A,B )
and the rigidity score (Fig. 4C ) show opposite trends, in
line with the extensive occurrence of flexible loops on the
S surface.
Using our consensus score, we identified nine epitope
candidates (E1-E9; Fig. 5 and Table I). Epitope candidates E3-E6 recover known epitopes (Fig. 3F,G and
Fig. 4F ), achieving residue-level accuracy in some cases
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3); in addition, we identify epitope

reside in the structured head of S. By contrast, low accessibility and high flexibility in the hinges [15] give the
stalk low overall epitope scores.

DISCUSSION

Validation through identification of known epitopes.
Even though SARS-CoV-2 was identified only a few
months ago, several groups have already reported on
antibodies binding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [30, 33–
38]. Most notably, Yuan and co-workers structurally
characterized the binding of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody CR3022 to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain
[30, 33, 39]. Their structure reveals an epitope distal to
the ACE2 binding site that requires at least two of the
S protomers to be in the open conformation to permit
binding without steric clash. Interestingly, while our sim-

ulations do not probe the doubly open configuration, the
epitope reported by Yuan et al. [30] is still successfully
identified with a significant consensus score. Moreover,
epitopes for other reported antibodies H104 [34], CB6
[35], P2B-2F6 [36], S309 [38], and 4A8 [40] also match
regions of high consensus score. In particular, our candidate epitopes E5 and E6 overlap with the reported binding sites in the RBD for neutralizing antibodies. We
conclude that our epitope-identification methodology is
robust.
Dependence on detailed glycosylation pattern. The
complexity and variability of S glycosylation in situ remains poorly understood. Mass spectrometry on recombinant S confirmed its extensive glycosylation [21]. CyoET images of intact viral particles revealed branching
points in the glycans [15], indicative of complex glycans.
We addressed this uncertainty by repeating our docking
accessibility analysis for different glycosylation patterns.
We considered pruned (mannose-only) glycans by removing fucose, sialic acid, and galactose. Remarkably, this
pruned glycan shield impedes Fab accessibility almost as
effectively (∼60%) as the full shield (∼80%), even if epitopes E8 and E9 become somewhat more exposed with
trimmed glycans (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Overall, we
conclude that even a light glycan coverage strongly reduces the antibody accessibility of the protein.
Structural and dynamic characteristics of candidate
epitopes. Epitopes E1-E3 are part of the N-terminal domain, which is formed mostly of antiparallel β sheets
(residues 1-291). All three epitopes include flexible loops

and folded β strands (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Epitope
E4 is located on a two-turn α-helix flanked by a short
twin α-helix and lying on a five-strand antiparallel βsheet. This arrangement provides the epitope with remarkable stability (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B ). Epitopes E5
and E6 are located on the apical part of S in the RBD,
and are composed mostly of flexible loops. E5 and E6
jointly span a contiguous surface in chain A, which is
in the open conformation. By contrast, in the closed
chains B and C, this surface is altered and E6 is buried
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4C ). The epitope E7 is part of a
stable helix that connects neighboring β-sheets (SI Appendix, Fig. S4D). E8 comprises two quite long and flexible loops (residues 634-641 and 674-693), and two shorter
and less flexible ones (SI Appendix, Fig. S4E ). Finally,
E9 is located on a short and flexible loop (SI Appendix,
Fig. S4F ).
Guidance for immunogen and vaccine design. Having
identified accessible, relatively structured, and conserved
epitope sequences, one of the challenges is to present
these epitopes in an immunogenic manner to induce a robust antibody response. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S
comprises distinct domains with residue numbers (A) 26290, (B) 591-699, and (C) 1071-1138. Domains A and B
encompass the predicted epitopes E1, E2 and E3, respectively, and E8 is contained within domain B. We speculate that these domains may fold independently, possibly
after suitable sequence redesigns, and could thus be used
to present the epitopes faithfully.

Glycans as epitopes. There have been reports of
glycan-mediated antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 S [18]
and to HIV-1 Env [41]. While this could open up possibilities for epitope binding, the natural variability of the
glycan shield [21], along with its extensive structural dynamics demonstrated here, currently preclude a systematic search for glycan-involving epitopes. Moreover, with
human and viral proteins carrying chemically equivalent
glycan coats, the risk of autoreaction is significant [41].
Therefore, we concentrated here on amino acid epitopes.

We identified epitope candidates on the SARS-CoV-2
S protein surface by combining accurate atomistic modelling, multi-microsecond MD simulations, and a range of
bioinformatics and analysis methods. We concentrated
on sites that are accessible to antibodies, unencumbered
be the glycan shield, and fairly rigid. We also required
these sites to be conserved in sequence and to display
signatures expected to elicit an immune response. From
all these features, we determined a combined consensus
epitope score that enabled us to predict nine distinct epitope sites. Validating our methodology, we recovered five
epitopes that overlap with experimentally characterized
epitopes, including a “cryptic” site [30].
Highly dynamic glycans shield a large fraction of the S
surface. Even though the instantaneous surface coverage
of the glycans is low, the long-time average density of
few well placed glycans covers most of the protein surface. In particular, only three N-glycosylation sites per
protein chain suffice to shield the stalk domain and block
antibody binding to this functionally critical part of the
protein. New and conflicting reports emerge on the glycan types on the S surface [21, 42], with glycan composition possibly varying from host to host. We considered
both light and heavy glycan coverages in our analysis,
which should encompass most of the glycan variability.
Both extremes show that glycosylation strongly protects
S from interactions with antibodies.
The different epitopes we predicted are the starting
point to engineering stable immunogenic constructs that
robustly elicit the production of antibodies. A fragmentbased epitope presentation avoids the many challenges
of working with full-length S, a multimeric and highly
dynamic membrane protein, whose prefusion structure
is likely metastable. Epitopes E1, E2, E3, and E8 are
particularly promising candidates. They are located on
distinct S domains that could fold independently and
present these epitopes in a native-like manner. Additionally, epitopes that are distributed on the surface of
S will make the onset of resistance due to mutations less
likely. The approach we introduced in this paper could
be extended to predict epitopes from an integrated analysis of diverse betacoronaviruses, with the ultimate aim
of producing a universal vaccine that guarantees broad
protection against the whole virus family.

SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS

Full-length molecular model of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. The modeling procedure of the
full-length SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is outlined in Fig. S5. We based our model of the SARSCoV-2 S1/S2 S domain on a recently determined structure (PDB ID: 6VSB[1]). We added missing
loops using MODELLER [2]. We modeled the stalk connecting the S head to the membrane as
two distinct coiled coils (CCs, henceforth denoted CC1 and HR2) based on CC predictions [3, 4].
CC1 and HR2 at positions 1138-1158 and 1167-1204 are predicted with low and high confidence,
respectively. However, since the N-terminal ends of the three helices in CC1 have been resolved in
the experimental structures [1, 5], we modeled both segments as trimeric CCs with CCBuilder [6],
using the heptad repeat register prediction of [3] and generously extending all termini by several
residues to prevent destabilization of the CCs from solvation effects at the termini. Thus, the
first model of CC1 comprised residues 1137-1163, while HR2 comprised residues 1161-1214. We
then performed 1 µs-long MD simulations of the solvated CC1 and HR2 models individually with
procedures and parameter settings as described below. In CC1 and HR2, residues 1138-1158 and
1167-1204 retained stable CC structures, respectively (Fig. S7). The CC structures of snapshots at
390 ns (CC1) and 166 ns (HR2) were integrated into a model of full-length SARS-CoV-2 S.
Glycosylation of S ectodomain and connector domain. There are 22 N-glycosylation sequons
present on the surface of S, all of which have been confirmed recently by mass spectrometry of a
recombinant protein [7]. Distinct glycan types are preferred on various sequons, with the majority
being oligomannose, followed by sialylated and fucosylated complex glycans and a minority of the
hybrid type. Here we selected the most abundant species at each site, as shown in Fig. S8. All
fucose residues were linked in α-1,3 position and sialic acid in α-2,3. Consistent with the low glycan
occupancy in the structure in situ [8], O-glycosylation in positions 323 and 325 was not included.
Contrary to some observations [9], the complete glycosylation pattern including heavy glycosylation
of the stalk seems to reflect better the situation in situ [8].
Modeling of the transmembrane domain. Lacking a structure for the S transmembrane domain
(TMD), we used a hierarchical procedure to model the TMD trimer. Secondary structure predictions
revealed that the TMD is likely to be formed of two helical stretches with a long transmembrane
helix (residues 1212-1237), followed by a shorter C-terminal helix (residues 1242-1249) with features
of an amphipathic helix. The remaining 24 C-terminal residues were predicted as disordered. We
hypothesized that the C-terminal helix extends to K1255 and encompasses all cysteine residues,
leaving a total of 18 disordered residues at the C-terminus.

We used a manually curated sequence alignment to build a homology model of the S protein
TMD trimer helical core (residues 1208-1237) with MODELLER [2]. We palmitoylated all cysteines, inserted the trimer into a lipid bilayer (see below and Table S2), and relaxed the system
using molecular dynamics (MD; see parameters below) for 1 µs, to properly equilibrate the relative
orientation of the protomers.
Separately, we built an L-shaped TMD monomer model by appending the C-terminal helix
(residues 1243-1265, modeled as an ideal α-helix) to the TMD core helix (residues 1208-1237).
The C-terminal helix was oriented such that all cysteines pointed into the hydrophobic core of
the membrane. The five residues connecting the TMD and C-terminal helix, as well as the 18
C-terminal residues were modeled as unstructured loops using MODELLER [2]. All cysteines
were palmitoylated and the monomer was inserted into a lipid bilayer, then relaxed by molecular
dynamics for 1 µs for proper positioning of the C-terminal helix with respect to the lipid head
groups.
Finally, a TMD trimer model was obtained by structurally fitting the relaxed L-shaped monomer
onto the relaxed transmembrane trimer. In two out of three monomers, this resulted in an outwardpointing, clash-free C-terminal helix. In the third monomer, the C-terminal helix was manually
rotated around the z-axis to relieve clashes.
Assembly of full-length S model. A full-length model of S was built by manually matching the
separate structural domains using PyMOL [10], and then building missing connecting residues as
unstructured linkers with MODELLER [2].
Membrane lipid composition. Coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are assembled in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [11]. We therefore modeled the viral envelope with an ER-like
composition [12] as detailed in Table S2. The transmembrane domain structures described above
were inserted into the ER-like membrane using CHARMM-GUI [13–17].
Molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with GROMACS 2019.6 [18], using the CHARMM36m protein and glycan force field [19–21], in combination
with the TIP3P water model [22]. Ions parameters were those by Luo and Roux [23].
After energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm for 55 000 steps, the system was
equilibrated in the NVT ensemble for 375 ps with a time step of 1 fs, followed by 1500 ps with a
time step of 2 fs. In the equilibration runs, the Berendsen thermostat [24] was used for temperature
coupling, with the coupling constant τ = 1 ps. After 250 ps, we used the Parrinello-Rahman barostat
[25] to apply semiisotropic pressure coupling, using τ = 5 ps and compressibility 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1 .
LINCS constraints[26] were applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms, allowing us to use a 2 fs

integration timestep for equilibration. During equilibration, restraints on positions and dihedrals
were gradually decreased from 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−2 to 0.
Due to the large system size, we adopted specific strategies to enhance the simulation speed
during production. We used an integration timestep of 4 fs. All hydrogen masses were doubled,
corresponding to deuterium, to avoid instabilities from high frequency vibrations. Cutoffs for
non-bonded interactions were set to 1 nm. In addition, temperature control was switched to the
V-rescale thermostat [27]. We used MDBenchmark to perform scaling studies and determine the
optimal hardware configuration and run settings (MPI ranks/OpenMP threads) [28].
Rigid-body docking. We probed the steric accessibility for antibody binding using rigid-body
docking. The Fab of antibody CR3022 (PDB ID: 6W41 [29]) was used for a coarse-grained rigidbody Monte Carlo (MC) docking analysis, following the procedure described in [30]. Backbone Cα
atoms were recorded every 10 ns of the MD simulation. Each snapshot was centered in a 24.5 nm ×
24.5 nm × 36 nm orthorhombic simulation box. The Fab was subjected to 2 × 105 translation and
rotation MC moves, recorded every 20 moves.
In a first step, we probed the steric accessibility of the protein surface without glycans using rigidbody MC simulations at high temperature (T = 10 000 K). Contacts between the complementaritydetermining region of the Fab (heavy chain residues 31-35, 50-65, 95-102; and light chain residues
24-34, 50-56, 89-97) and S were then counted based on a distance criterion of twice the sum of van
der Waals (vdW) radii of the amino acids involved in the contact (with radius definitions following
[30]). In a second step, we assessed the influence of glycans on the steric surface coverage by
excluding all snapshots in which the Fab clashed with glycans. The full glycans and a mannose-only
(“pruned”) version of the glycans were considered. Every sugar residue of a glycan was represented
by a pseudoparticle positioned at the residue center of mass. The effective vdW radius of this sugar
bead was estimated from the sugar residue radius of gyration and found to be roughly equal to the
vdW radius of an alanine residue, as defined in [30]. A distance cutoff of the sum of Fab residue
vdW radius and glycan (≈ alanine) vdW radius was used to determine clashes.

SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS

Evaluation of the accessibility reduction due to the glycan shield.

We quantified the glycan cov-

erage by comparing global accessibility (to rays or to the rigid, coarse-grained Fab) of the S surface
with full glycans and without glycans. First, the global accessibility was computed as the sum over
all residues of the numbers of hits for a given probing method and glycosylation pattern. Then, we

considered the ratio of global accessibility with glycans over global accessibility without glycans.
Finally, the relative accessibility reduction due to glycan coverage was taken as the complementary
of this global accessibility ratio (relative accessibility reduction = 1 − global accessibility ratio).
