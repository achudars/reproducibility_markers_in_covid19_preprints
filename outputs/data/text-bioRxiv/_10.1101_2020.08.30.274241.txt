Abstract – 50 words

12

We report the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces under indoor, summer and

13

spring/fall conditions. The virus was more stable under the spring/fall condition with virus

14

half-lives ranging from 17.11 to 31.82 hours, whereas under indoor and summer conditions

15

the virus half-lives were 3.5–11.33 and 2.54–5.58 hours, respectively.

The Study

19

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which first emerged in a wet market in

20

Wuhan, China, is responsible for the current pandemic. Although transmission of SARS-

21

CoV-2 mainly occurs through infectious droplets or close contact with an infected person, the

22

virus droplet can survive and remain infectious on inanimate surfaces, which can contribute

23

to the spread of the virus (1). Previous studies showed that virus remained infectious from

24

hours to days on various type of surfaces under various temperature-controlled environmental

25

conditions (2-4). However, virus stability on surfaces under different climate conditions

26

which could be used to predict seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, is poorly understood. In this

27

manuscript, we evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on different types of surfaces under

28

indoor, summer and spring/fall conditions to estimate the biological half-life of the virus.

29

We tested SARS-CoV-2 stability on 12 material surfaces including nitrile glove, Tyvek, N95

30

mask, cloth, Styrofoam, cardboard, concrete, rubber, glass, polypropylene, stainless steel and

31

galvanized steel (see Technical Appendix). Each material surface was placed in a 6-well or

32

12-well plate and 50 μl of virus inoculum consisting of 5×104 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (strain

33

USA-WA1/2020) in DMEM with 5% FBS was added onto each material. The positive

34

control had the same amount of virus in medium in a sealed 2mL tube. The virus was air-

35

dried inside a biosafety cabinet (approximately 4.5 hours). The plate with the virus-

36

contaminated material was incubated under three different conditions: 21°C/60% relative

37

humidity (RH), 25°C/70% RH and 13°C/66% RH, environmental conditions simulating

38

indoor setting, summer, and spring/fall conditions for the Midwestern U.S., respectively

39

(Technical Appendix Table 1). At each time point indicated, infectious virus was recovered in

40

2 mL media through vigorous vortexing for 10 seconds. Cardboard was soaked with media

41

for 5 minutes and vortexed for 10 seconds. The recovered virus was titrated on Vero E6 cells

42

and virus titer was calculated by the Reed-Muench method. The assay was performed in

43

triplicate. A best-fitting line was estimated using a linear regression model in order to

44

calculate the virus half-life on each surface as a -log10(2)/slope and tested for statistical

45

significance using default analysis which is compatible to analysis of covariance in GraphPad

46

Prism 5.

47

SARS-CoV-2 was relatively stable in medium throughout the study phase, showing a 1.17-

48

log reduction of virus titer at 96 hours post-contamination (hpc) at 25°C/70% RH (Figure 1).

49

We found a 1-log reduction of virus after 4.5 hours at room temperature (21oC/60% RH) on

50

all materials (103.3 to 104.2 TCID50), except for cloth (102.4 to 102.7 TCID50), which served as

51

the starting titers for the linear regression model. At 21°C/60% RH, infectious virus was

52

recovered from cloth up to 24 hpc, from concrete, polypropylene, stainless steel and

53

galvanized steel up to 72 hpc, and from nitrile gloves, Tyvek, N95 mask, Styrofoam,

54

cardboard, rubber and glass up to 96 hpc. In contrast, viable virus disappeared quickly under

55

summer conditions (25°C/70% RH) and was undetectable on cloth, cardboard, concrete and

56

stainless steel at 48 hpc, and on nitrile gloves, Tyvek, N95 mask, Styrofoam, rubber, glass,

57

polypropylene, galvanized steel at 72 hpc. However, we observed longer survival times at

58

spring/fall conditions (13°C/66% RH). Virus titers on surfaces ranged from 101.1 to 102.3

59

TCID50 at 168 hpc, except for cloth with virus only detectable up to 72 hpc. Half-lives of

60

SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces ranged from 3.5 to 12.86 hours at 21°C/60% RH, 2.54 to 5.58

61

hours at 25°C/70% RH, and 17.11 to 31.82 hours at 13°C/66% RH (Table 1). The virus

62

survived significantly longer on all surfaces at spring/fall conditions (13°C/66% RH) when

63

compared to summer and indoor conditions. Similarly, we found a significant difference in

64

virus survival on surfaces between indoor and summer conditions except for cloth.

65

Potential modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 include direct contact with an infected

66

person via droplets, inhalation of aerosol or infectious body fluids, and exposure to

67

contaminated surfaces (fomite). To date, there is no scientific report which demonstrates

68

SARS-CoV-2 infection via contaminated surfaces. However, the role of fomites in

69

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is debated because the virus has been detected on

70

environmental surfaces as well as personal protective equipment in hospitals and households

71

(5, 6). In addition, indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been supported by a cluster of

72

SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in a shopping mall, in which contact tracing failed to find any

73

evidence for direct contact to an infected person, only to sharing of facilities (7). In this

74

respect, our study highlights the possible role of contaminated surfaces in SARS-CoV-2

75

transmissions because SARS-CoV-2 remained viable and infectious on surfaces for 1 to 4

76

days at indoor conditions (21°C/60% RH), 1 to 3 days during summer conditions (25°C/70%

77

RH) and over 7 days during spring/fall conditions (13°C/66% RH).

78

Van Doremalen et al. (3) described that the SARS-CoV-2 half-life which ranges from 3.46 to

79

6.81 hours on cardboard, plastic and stainless steel at 22°C/40% RH. Chin et al (2) reported a

80

half-life of 4.8 to 23.9 hours on glass, banknotes, inner and outer mask layers, polypropylene

81

and stainless steel at 22°C/65% RH. We found the half-life on most surfaces at 21°C/60% RH

82

is 6.93–12.86, but the virus is quickly inactivated on cloth with a 3.5 hours half-life. The

83

difference might be explained by the composition of the virus inoculum (e.g., FBS

84

concentration), the volume of inoculum, different preparation of material and the different

85

environmental conditions. However, our results, along with other two studies, showed that

86

SARS-CoV-2 is able to survive on some surfaces for several days under indoor conditions,

87

which might play a potential role in virus transmission. The longest half-life of the virus was

88

found in spring/fall conditions (13°C/66% RH), followed by indoor conditions (21°C/60%

89

RH) and summer conditions (25°C/70% RH); this suggests that virus stability on surfaces is

90

highly dependent on temperature and RH. Prolonged virus survival on surfaces in spring/fall

91

and winter might support SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contaminated fomites and

92

potentially contribute to new outbreaks and/or seasonal occurrence in the post-pandemic era,

93

a scenario described for influenza virus and other human coronaviruses (8).

94

Our study showed a remarkable persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on various types of

95

surfaces, especially under spring/fall climate conditions. However, virus stability was highly

96

dependent on the substrate as well as temperature and humidity. Previous studies showed

97

reduced virus stability in human nasal mucus and sputum when compared to culture medium

98

(9) even at 4°C/40% RH, whereas addition of bovine serum albumin into the virus inoculum

99

increased SARS-CoV-2 survival times (10). In addition, exposure to simulated sunlight

100

accelerated the inactivation of the virus on stainless steel (11), indicating that additional

101

factors play a role in SARS-CoV-2 survival on surfaces in field settings.

102

In conclusion, our study determines the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 on diverse surfaces under

103

different climatic conditions, which correlates to the potential risk of contaminated surfaces

104

to spread the virus. It clearly demonstrates, that the virus survives longer under spring/fall not

105

summer conditions. Therefore, practice of good personal hygiene and regular disinfection of

106

potentially contaminated surfaces remains a critical tool to minimize the risk of infection

107

through contaminated surfaces.

types of surfaces. Each figure represents the virus decay on each surface. Total 50 μl of virus

161

inoculum (5×104 TCID50, black dot) was added onto each material and dried for 4.5 hours

162

inside a biosafety cabinet. The virus survival was evaluated under three different conditions:

163

at 21°C/60% RH (grey), 25°C/70% RH (red) and 13°C/66% RH (green). The infectious virus

164

was recovered at 4.5 (after drying period), 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-contamination (hpc)

165

at 21°C/60% RH and 25°C/70% RH and 4.5, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hpc at 13°C/66% RH.

166

Virus titer at each time point was expressed as mean log10 transformed titer with standard

167

deviation. Linear regression models were estimated; the solid line and its shade area represent

168

an estimated best fit model and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. Limit of detection

169

(LOD) in each titration assay was 100.968 TCID50 and a negative result is represented as a half

170

value of LOD, 100.667 TCID50. The dash line shows LOD in triplicate, 100.767 TCID50, when

171

there was LOD in one replicate, but negative in two other replicates. Statistical significance

172

between two slopes of linear regression models is represented as * (p < 0.05), ** (p < 0.01),
