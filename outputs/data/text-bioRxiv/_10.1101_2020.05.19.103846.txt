Abstract
Since spilling over into humans, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe,
accumulating significant genetic diversity. The structure of this genetic diversity, and
whether it reveals epidemiological insights, are fundamental questions for understanding the
evolutionary trajectory of this virus. Here we use a recently developed phylodynamic
approach to uncover phylogenetic structures underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We find
support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different
demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example,
Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the
exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize
Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions
responsible for viral replication and cell entry. Even though Lineages A and B had distinct
demographic patterns, they were much more difficult to distinguish. Continuous application
of phylogenetic approaches to track the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages
will be increasingly important to validate the efficacy of control efforts and monitor
significant evolutionary events in the future.

Introduction
The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 represents an
unparalleled global health threat1. Within four months of emerging from Wuhan in Central
China, SARS-CoV-2 has now spread to nearly every country and is a major source of
mortality1. The first cases of the virus outside China occurred in Thailand on January 13, and
by January 30 there were 83 cases in 18 countries. As of May 19, there were over 4.5 million
cases in 203 countries or territories1. Coronaviruses (order: Nidovirales, family:
Coronaviridae) are enveloped positive-sense non-segmented RNA viruses that infect a variety
of mammals and birds. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified infecting
humans. The closest relatives (RaTG13 and RmYN02, 96% and 93% nucleotide identity
respectively) derive from the Intermediate Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) and the
Malayan Horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus malayanus)2, although the original host is yet to be
conclusively identified 3. Since spilling over to humans, the virus has diverged rapidly, but it
is unclear whether these mutations have resulted in SARS-CoV-2 lineages with different
epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics 4–9. Several lineages have been highlighted
for potential significance 4–6,9. For consistency, we adopt the nomenclature outlined in 8
which classifies the initial lineages as A and B (previously labelled ‘S’ and ‘L’4). There is
some evidence that Lineage A is ancestral to the more recent Lineages B 8, even though the
earliest assembled genomes from December 2019 belong to Lineage B 4,8. Sequences within
Lineage A and the closest known bat virus share two nucleotides in ORF1ab and ORF8 genes
that are not found in Lineage B 8. More recently, a new lineage ‘G’6 has been documented
originating Europe in February 6. For consistency we call this Lineage C. It is currently
unclear if these lineages differ phenotypically, or whether these lineages show distinctive
demographic signatures (i.e., diversity increasing, plateauing or declining). Any further
population sub-structure within these three lineages is also unknown at this point.

Pathogen population structure can provide key insights into the epidemiology of an outbreak,
such as whether intervention strategies are working to contain spread 7. Population structure
may also align with geography, reflecting the contact structure of the host population.
Understanding these variations is important both for vaccine development and evaluating the
impact of control efforts across the globe. Detecting structure, particularly in recently
emerged outbreaks, is a challenge as these patterns within the data can be cryptic 8. For
example, some lineages within a population can be rapidly expanding whereas others can be
stationary 8. Utilizing large numbers of sequences provided by GISAID 9and recently
developed phylodynamic tools, we interrogate SARS-CoV-2 population patterns to identify
‘hidden’ structure in the pandemic and investigate whether lineages are geographically
partitioned and/or are on distinct demographic trajectories.

Three distinct lineages
Our analyses show support for three distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 actively spreading
around the world (Fig. 1). We demonstrate that they are not only phylogenetically separate
but also have different demographic trajectories. Based on our maximum likelihood and
Bayesian time-scaled phylogenies (see Methods), we estimated that Lineage A (and SARSCoV-2 overall) diverged from its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in November 2019
(95% high posterior density/confidence intervals November – December 2019, Fig. 1).
Estimates from both approaches are comparable to other studies that have analysed greater
numbers of sequences 9. Since emerging in China, our demographic analysis 13 suggests that
the growth rate of the effective population size of Lineage A increased in early January (Fig.
2a), then decreasing throughout February before increasing once more. This dip coincides
with control of the pathogen in China 14 and subsequent uncontrolled spread in Europe and

North America. We found a similar pattern when we analyzed the complete dataset (Fig. 3a).
The majority of sequences belonging to Lineage A originated from China in January to early
February, whereas sequences from the US, and Washington State in particular, make up the
majority of the sequences collated in March.

Our results support other analyses suggesting that Lineage B was derived from Lineage A
and was not an independent introduction, even though Lineage B contains the earliest
available genomes 4,8. Linked mutations in ORF1ab (8782, synonymous) and ORF8 (28144,
non-synonymous) help to separate these lineages (as in 4,8). Non-synonymous mutations in
ORF14 (28881-3) also partially define these lineages. However, there is a high degree of
phylogenetic uncertainty about the node representing their most recent common ancestor and
this lineage may be polyphyletic (Fig. 1, Fig. S1). Soon after diverging from Lineage A, the
growth rate of Lineage B was at its highest but then formed a pattern of peaks and troughs
with the credible interval including zero (representing no growth) from January onwards (Fig.
2b). The peak growth rate coincided with that of Lineage A (Fig. 2) indicating that this first
wave of SARS-CoV-2 through China generated a relatively large amount of the genetic
diversity. As many sequences classified in Lineage B originate from China (Fig. 1) the
subsequent decline of this lineage may also be linked to control of the virus. There is also
evidence for a spike in growth rate of both Lineage A and Lineage B when spread increased
outside of China and this coincides with the divergence date for Lineage C (Fig. 2).

Lineage C, in contrast, was predominantly European with no evidence that it circulated in
China (Fig. 1). This lineage was well supported as monophyletic (node posterior support =
0.99, 91% bootstrap support, Fig. 1) and diverged from Lineage B in late January (95% HPD

late January – early February). Linked non-synonymous mutations differentiated this lineage
in the S gene (sites 23402-04) and ORF1ab (14407-09) regions. The mutations in the
ORF1ab gene alter the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that are crucial for the
replication of RNA from the RNA template. There is evidence that this RdRp mutation may
increase the mutation rate of the virus overall by reducing copy fidelity7. The growth rate of
Lineage C was initially high in late February, prior to the rapid increase of cases in Europe,
but then declined, with one further peak around February 27, although the short duration
suggests this may not be significant and could represent sampling noise. Accordingly, the
effective population size of Lineage C increased rapidly during February – March, whereas
there was only a small increase estimated for Lineage A and a decline in Lineage B (Fig. 2).
Real-time phylogenetic reconstruction in Nextstrain 15 has subsequently shown (as of May 18
2020) that this lineage has further expanded and is the most frequently sampled across the
globe. Given the potential significance of the RdRp and spike gene mutation and subsequent
rapid expansion across the globe, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mutations
in Lineage C have increased transmissibility compared to the other lineages 6. However, our
results on their own can not rule out the possibility that the expansion of this lineage was the
result of a founder effect 6 (i.e., the rapid expansion of Lineage C was because it was the first
broadly transmitted in Europe). More analysis of these co-circulating lineages at a local level
would be required to evaluate the relative fitness of the lineages.

The growth and decline of SARS-CoV-2 lineages
We were able to identify three lineages that were not only genetically distinctive but also had
unique demographic signatures, revealing insights into the underlying epidemiology of this
pandemic. The number of cases increases day-by-day, as does the effective population size of

the virus overall (Fig. 3b); both to be expected by their linear relationship in the early phase
of a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model 16. It appears that this increase
is not distributed evenly across the phylogeny, with all lineages showing some evidence of
decline at different times. However, there is bias in countries represented in the GISAID
dataset we accessed, with, for example, no sequences in our dataset from the Middle East
even though there was a significant (and ongoing) outbreak in this region. Even though the
outbreak is only months old at the time of writing, there is already sufficient genetic diversity
to track the demographic trajectories of each lineage. Approaches such as the one presented
here, combined with workflows quantifying geographical lineage dispersal 17, will be even
more useful in the coming months to assess the longer-term impacts on SARS-CoV-2 control
measures across the globe.

Methods
We downloaded 779 complete “high coverage only” SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from
GISAID 9 (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; https://www.gisaid.org/) on the
24th March 2020. We aligned these sequences with MAFFT 18 using the CIPRES 19 server and
visually checked the results. We trimmed the first 130 bp and last 50 bp of the aligned
sequences to remove potential sequencing artefacts in line with Nextstrain protocol 15. We
tested for recombination in our alignment using RDP4120. We removed all duplicate
sequences and sequences with more than 10% missing data. We then constructed a Maximum
Likelihood tree using IQ tree with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps21 using the inbuilt model
selection algorithm (‘ModelFinder’ 22). We confirmed that there was a significant temporal
signal in the dataset using root to tip regressions in TempEst21 (R2 = 0.19, correlation
coefficient = 0.42). We removed sequences from Washington State and China that likely had
some sequence error as they were strong outliers in the TempEst analysis. This reduced the
dataset to 587 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

We used both the maximum likelihood-based treedater method 24 and a Bayesian approach to
reconstruct the timing and spread of SARS-CoV-2 . We employed the computationally
intensive Bayesian methodology (BEAST version 1.10.4 25 with BEAGLE 26 computational
enhancement) to validate our maximum likelihood MRCA estimates and to provide dating
estimates for internal nodes of interest. For the BEAST analysis, as there is strong evidence
that the pandemic is growing, we assumed an exponential growth coalescent model.
Preliminary analyses revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in
evolutionary rate estimates using either a strict or relaxed molecular clock. Thus, we assumed
a strict molecular clock and used uninformative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)

reference prior to estimate substitution rate across time. We also tested a relaxed clock model
and found very little rate variation across the tree and very similar estimates of the MRCA.
We performed each BEAST analysis in duplicate and ran the MCMC chains for 200 million
iterations sampling every 20 000 steps. We visualized these results using Tracer 27 and
ensured that all parameter estimates had converged with an effective sample size (ESS) >
200. We generated a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator, discarding
20% as burn-in.
Our previously described ML tree was used as input of the treedater method 24 to produce a
ML time-scaled phylogeny. Treedater is an efficient maximum likelihood method that
implements both a strict clock model using a Poisson process and a relaxed clock model
using a Gamma-Poisson mixture. We estimated the confidence intervals for the dates of
ancestors in this tree using parametric bootstraps.

We then used this time-stamped ML tree to test for structure within the tree using the nonparametric treestructure approach 11. Briefly, this method partitions the tips and internal
nodes of a tree into discrete sets characterized by comparable coalescent patterns. See 11 for
analytical details. Given the relatively low levels of genetic diversity, we constrained our
structure analysis to be able to identify a maximum of four lineages by making the minimum
clade size 145 sequences and performed 100,000 tree simulations (with a significance
threshold of 0.05). We could not perform the same analysis on our Bayesian tree as it
included negative branch lengths, which violates the assumptions of treestructure.

For the complete dataset and each lineage subset, we modelled the effective population size
growth rate through time using the skygrowth package11. Skygrowth is a non-parametric

Bayesian approach that applies a first-order autoregressive stochastic process on the growth
rate of the effective population size. We parameterized our skygrowth models assuming that
SARS-CoV-2 effective population size could change every three days. We used an
exponential distribution with a mean of 0.1 to estimate the precision parameter (Τau). We
ran the MCMC for 20 million generations thinning every 1000th sample and considered each
analysis to be converged if the ESS >200. We compared our skygrowth models to Skygrid
models using the R package ‘phylodyn’ 24 using the default settings. The ML tree and code
used to perform these analyses are available here: https://github.com/nfj1380/covid19_evolution.
