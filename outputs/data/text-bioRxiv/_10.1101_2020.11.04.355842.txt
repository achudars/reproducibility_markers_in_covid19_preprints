SARS-CoV-2 can mutate to evade immunity, with consequences for the efficacy of
emerging vaccines and antibody therapeutics. Herein we demonstrate that the
immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding motif (RBM) is the most
divergent region of S, and provide epidemiological, clinical, and molecular
characterization of a prevalent RBM variant, N439K. We demonstrate that N439K S
protein has enhanced binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor, and that N439K virus
has similar clinical outcomes and in vitro replication fitness as compared to wildtype. We observed that the N439K mutation resulted in immune escape from a panel
of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, including one in clinical trials, as well as from
polyclonal sera from a sizeable fraction of persons recovered from infection. Immune
evasion mutations that maintain virulence and fitness such as N439K can emerge
within SARS-CoV-2 S, highlighting the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to
guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and expanded
globally, resulting in over 41 million confirmed cases as of October 2020. Molecular
epidemiology studies across the world have generated over 135,000 viral genomic
sequences and have been shared with unprecedented speed via the GISAID Initiative
(https://www.gisaid.org/). These data are essential for monitoring virus spread (Meredith et
al., 2020) and evolution. Of particular interest is the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 surface
protein, spike (S), which is responsible for viral entry via its interaction with the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor on host cells. The S protein is the
target of neutralizing antibodies generated by infection (Jiang et al., 2020) or vaccination
(Folegatti et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020; Keech et al., 2020) as well as monoclonal
antibody (mAb) drugs currently in clinical trials (Hansen et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020;
Pinto et al., 2020).
A SARS-CoV-2 S variant, D614G, is now dominant in most places around the globe
(Callaway, 2020). Studies in vitro indicate that this variant may have greater infectivity
while molecular epidemiology indicates that it spreads efficiently and likely maintains
virulence (Hu et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Amino
acid 614 is outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S, the domain targeted by 90% of
neutralizing antibody activity in serum of SARS-CoV-2 survivors (Piccoli et al., 2020). Initial

studies suggest that D614G actually exhibits increased sensitivity to neutralizing
antibodies, likely due to its effects on the molecular dynamics of the spike protein (Hou et
al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020). Therefore, this dominant variant is unlikely to escape
antibody-mediated immunity.
The low numbers of novel mutations reaching high frequency in sequenced SARSCoV-2 isolates may relate to the moderate intrinsic error rate of the replication machinery
of SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al., 2020c; Robson et al., 2020) and to this new human coronavirus
requiring no significant adaption to humans (MacLean et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the
increasing number of infected individuals and the large reservoir of individuals susceptible
to infection increases the likelihood that novel variants that impact vaccine and therapeutic
development will emerge and spread. Moreover, the full impact of immune selection, which
can drive variant selection, likely has not yet had a dominant influence on the pandemic,
since herd immunity has not yet been attained. As population immunity increases and
vaccines are deployed at scale this might change. The potential for circulating viral variants
to derail promising vaccine or antibody-based prophylactics or treatments, even in the
absence of selective pressure from the drug or vaccine, is demonstrated by the failure of a
Phase III clinical trial of a mAb targeting the respiratory syncytial virus (Simoes et al.,
2020), and the need for new influenza vaccines on a yearly basis. It is therefore critical to
understand whether and how SARS-CoV-2 may evolve to evade antibody-dependent
immunity.
Here, we examined the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif
(RBM), the primary target of the neutralizing Ab response within the RBD (Piccoli et al.,
2020) and found it to be less conserved than the RBD or the entire spike protein in
circulating viruses. To understand the implications of this structural plasticity for immune
evasion, we defined the clinical and epidemiological impact, the molecular features, and
the immune response to an RBM variant, N439K. This variant has arisen independently
twice, in both cases forming lineages of more than 500 sequences. As of October 2020, it
has been observed in 12 countries and is the second most commonly observed RBD
variant worldwide. We find that the N439K mutation is associated with a similar clinical
spectrum of disease and slightly higher viral loads in vivo compared with isolates with the
wild-type N439 residue, and that it results in immune escape from polyclonal sera from a
proportion of recovered individuals and a panel of neutralizing mAbs. N439K provides a
sentinel example of immune escape, indicating that RBM variants must be evaluated when
considering vaccines and the therapeutic or prophylactic use of mAbs. Long term control of
the pandemic will require systematic monitoring of immune escape variants and selection
of strategies that address the variants circulating in targeted populations.
RESULTS
The RBM is the least conserved region in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
Competing pressures influence the evolution of the spike RBM. First, the RBM
mediates viral entry (Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b) and
therefore it must maintain sufficient affinity to engage the entry receptor hACE2. Second, it
is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Wec

et al., 2020) and could be a primary location for the emergence of immune escape
mutations. We set out to understand these competing pressures by evaluating the
landscape of RBM sequence divergence observed in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and
in other viruses of the Sarbecovirus lineage.
We used published X-ray structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD:hACE2
complexes (Lan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005) to define the RBM residues using a 6 Å
distance cutoff (Figures 1A-C). We evaluated ~130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences
deposited in GISAID as of October 7, 2020 and observed a high number of variants
occurring in the RBM (Figure 1A). To understand how the divergence of the RBM
compares to the divergence of the entire RBD and the whole spike protein, we divided the
spike protein into three non-overlapping regions: the RBM, the RBD outside of the RBM,
and the full S protein outside of the RBD. We counted individual variants occurring at least
ten times, and quantified substitutions of different amino acids at the same position as
separate variants. We found that the RBM is the least conserved region of S (Figure 1B).
To understand this result further, we evaluated a published deep mutational
scanning (DMS) data set of the RBD (Starr et al., 2020) and compared it to sequences of
circulating viruses. The DMS data defines the effect of each possible single amino acid
change on both expression of the RBD and its capacity to bind hACE2. For each position
in the RBM, we compared the DMS results for all amino acid substitutions at that position
versus only substitutions that have been observed in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates
(Figure 1C). A subset of residues shows the largest loss of hACE2 binding upon mutation
(top ~1/3 of RBM residues in Figure 1C) and, as would be expected, few natural variants
of these residues have been observed to be circulating to date. Surprisingly, these
conserved residues each contribute weakly to the RBD:hACE2 total interaction energy (the
sum of pair-wise interaction energies for all residues at the binding interface in the X-ray
structure; “binding energy” in Figure 1C). For the majority of the RBM (bottom ~2/3 of RBM
residues in Figure 1C), variation in circulating virus sequences confirms the tolerance to
mutation predicted by the DMS data. Notably, several RBM residues forming the strongest
interactions with the receptor, e.g. K417 and E484, are not highly conserved despite their
predicted importance. These results suggest that the RBM has a degree of structural
plasticity whereby it is able to accommodate mutations without disrupting hACE2 binding.
Evolutionary analysis of Sarbecoviruses provides further support for RBM plasticity
(Boni et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b; Rambaut et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV RBM is highly
divergent from the SARS-CoV-2 RBM (Figure S1A-B) while maintaining hACE2 binding
affinity. Additionally, there are many sequence changes in the RBM across a panel of
related coronaviruses from animal isolates (Figure S1A-B, Table S1). To determine the
ability of members of the Sarbecovirus lineage to bind hACE2, we produced nine
recombinant RBD proteins corresponding to seven animal isolates, SARS-CoV-2, and
SARS-CoV and evaluated their binding to recombinant hACE2 (Figure S1C). We found
that three of the RBDs from animal isolates showed strong affinity for hACE2: GD
Pangolin, which has a highly similar RBM to SARS-CoV-2, and GX Pangolin and Bat CoV
WIV1, which have highly divergent RBMs (Figure S1A-B). This further supports the
conclusion that the RBM is structurally plastic, while retaining binding with hACE2 as a
receptor. Given this plasticity, we next considered whether an RBM variant can lead to
immune evasion while retaining virulence.

N439K is a prevalent SARS-CoV-2 RBM variant with increased ACE2 affinity
The two most commonly observed circulating RBD variants as of October 2020
contain mutations in the RBM (S477N and N439K). We first identified the N439K variant in
March 2020, circulating in Scotland from lineage B.1 (Rambaut et al., 2020) on the
background of D614G (Da Silva Filipe et al., 2020). Using phylogenetic analysis, we
determined this variant represented a single lineage (Figure 2A) that increased in
frequency to 553 sequences by June 20, 2020 (~10% of the available Scottish viral
genome sequences for this time period). Numbers of N439K and all other isolates
decreased in Scotland concurrent with control of the pandemic by initiation of stringent
public health measures and this lineage has not been detected in Scotland after June.
However, the N439K variant has been observed in >659 sequences in a second lineage in
Europe, first sampled in Romania on May 13, 2020, then Norway on June 23, 2020 and is
now circulating in 12 countries, as well as arising independently in the U.S. (Figure 2A-C).
As of Oct 6, 2020, all 1201 N439K variants arose from a C-to-A transversion in the third
codon position, though these counts are heavily influenced by sampling frequency which
varies widely between countries. As Scotland has a high sampling frequency for its
population size (~5.5M), it is possible to calculate a growth rate (Voltz and Frost, 2017)
based on a comparison of the Scottish lineages. We find that the growth rate is similar to
what has already been shown for the D614G background with no evidence for a faster rate
of growth than N439 lineages (Figure S2A).
In addition to its frequency and spread, the N439K variant stood out from other
circulating RBM variants as having a plausible mechanism for maintenance of viral fitness.
The equivalent position to N439K in the SARS-CoV RBM is also a positively-charged
amino acid (R426), which forms a salt bridge with hACE2 (Li et al., 2005). We therefore
hypothesized that the N439K SARS-CoV-2 variant may form this additional salt bridge at
the RBD-hACE2 interface (RBD N439K:hACE2 E329). Structural modeling supported that
this salt bridge could form without disrupting the binding interface, including the two original
salt bridges (RBD K417:hACE2 D30 and RBD E484:hACE2 K31) (Figure 3A-C). A salt
bridge is the strongest type of non-covalent bond and the N439K mutation could plausibly
increase the number of salt bridges at the binding interface from two to three, presenting
the hypothesis that the N439K variant may have enhanced binding for hACE2.
To test this hypothesis, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to evaluate
binding of recombinant N439K S or RBD protein to recombinant hACE2. We also
evaluated the N439R and K417V variants, each of which is found in SARS-CoV at these
positions. Across multiple assay formats, we found that the N439K and N439R variants
exhibited a ~2-fold enhanced binding affinity for hACE2 as compared to the original N439
variant (termed herein WT) (Figure 3D). The magnitude of this enhancement was
paralleled by a ~2-fold loss of binding affinity for the K417V variant relative to WT. Lastly,
we also tested the effect of the N439K/R and K417V mutations in combination. These
double variants form the same number of salt bridges at the hACE2 binding interface as
compared to WT, but one is at RBD position 439 rather than 417; we found they had an
hACE2 affinity similar to the WT (Figure 3D). These data indicate that acquisition of the
N439K mutation enhances binding affinity, which could have implications in vivo in the
context of natural infection. Also, the enhanced affinity could plausibly compensate for

other mutations that would otherwise be detrimental (e.g. K417V), further highlighting the
plasticity of the RBM.
N439K SARS-CoV-2 maintains fitness and virulence
The enhanced hACE2 affinity of the N439K variant, its geographical emergence as
independent lineages as well as its prevalence among circulating viral isolates is
consistent with maintained viral fitness. We set out to directly examine fitness by
evaluating clinical data and outcomes of virus carrying the N439K mutation versus WT
N439, as well as by direct in vitro viral growth and competition.
We used qPCR to evaluate viral load (as measured by cycle threshold, Ct) in 1,918
Scottish patients whose viral isolates had been sequenced (Figures 4A-B). Viral isolates
were either N439K/D614G (n=406), N439/D614G (n=978) or ancestral (N439/D614)
(n=534). Our analysis found strong evidence that the N439K/D614G genotype was
associated with marginally lower cycle threshold (Ct) than the N439/D614G genotype
(mean Ct value difference between N439K/D614G and N439/D614G: -0.65, 95% CI: -1.22,
-0.07) (Figure 4B). As Ct measurements were carried out in multiple sites, a sub-analysis
of viral load using RNA standards was carried out with available samples and showed a
near-complete correlation with Ct (Figure 4B). D614G has previously been associated with
higher viral loads/lower Ct values than D614 (Korber et al., 2020) but we did not detect this
difference in this statistical analysis due to the intercept of the model being imprecisely
estimated (Table S2).
Clinical outcomes were also obtained for a subset of these patients (n=1,591), who
were scored for severity of disease based on oxygen requirement: 1. No respiratory
support, 2: Supplemental oxygen, 3: Invasive or non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal
cannulae, 4: Death (Figures 4C and S2B). Genotype counts for this analysis were
N439K/D614G (n=399), D614G (with N439) (n=735) or ancestral (N439/D614) (n=457).
Analysis based on our ordinal scale indicated that the N439K/D614G viral genotype was
associated with similar clinical outcomes compared to D614G or ancestral genotypes
(posterior mean: 0.06, 95% CI: -1.21, 1.33) (Table S3). All other results from the severity
analysis were qualitatively similar to a previous analysis of the D614G mutation (Volz et al.,
2020). These clinical data indicate that the N439K virus is not attenuated.
We next tested growth of two representative SARS-CoV-2 isolates, GLA1 (WT
N439) and GLA2 (N439K), both with the D614G background (Table S4). Culture was
carried out for 72 hours in Vero E6-ACE2 cells either with or without TMPRSS2
expression. There was no significant difference between the growth of these strains after
inoculation at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.005 and 0.01. The N439K strain
replicated slightly faster early after inoculation (Figure 4D). These data indicate that the
N439K mutation does not exhibit dominant negative effects on viral growth, and most likely
supports normal replication. To further assess fitness for replication in cultured cells, we
carried out a cross-competition assay using inoculation of cells at a matched MOI followed
by quantitation of N439 and N439K by metagenomic NGS over time (Figure 4E). The
N439K strain demonstrated similar fitness as the WT N439 strain, with a possible fitness
advantage for N439K in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Taken together with the clinical
outcomes, these results indicate that the N439K mutation results in viral fitness that is
similar or possibly slightly improved compared to the wild-type N439.

The N439K variant evades antibody-mediated immunity
Having established that virus carrying the N439K mutation is fit, we sought to
understand whether this mutation evades antibody-mediated immunity by evaluating
recognition of the N439K variant by monoclonal antibodies and by polyclonal immune
serum from 445 recovered individuals, including 6 donors who were infected by the
SARS-CoV-2 N439K variant. 7.4% of the tested sera showed a greater than 2-fold
reduction in binding to N439K RBD as compared to WT RBD (Figures 5A-B and S3). In
some individuals the RBD response was diminished to low titers of <1:30 by the N439K
mutation. Thus, the response to the RBD is significantly influenced by the N439K mutant
within the immunodominant RBM domain (Piccoli et al., 2020) in a significant portion of
persons potentially immune to WT SARS-CoV-2. The majority of sera demonstrating loss
of binding were those that had overall lower responses to WT RBD, indicating lower Ab
titers. The sera from the six individuals known to have recovered from infection with SARSCoV-2 N439K virus showed no change in binding levels to WT RBD as compared to
N439K RBD (Figures 5A-B and S3). This may reflect a true variant-specific response or
that differential binding could not be measured due to the limited number of samples
analyzed.
To understand our results at the level of individual antibodies, we evaluated a panel
of 144 mAbs isolated from individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection early in the
pandemic (likely with N439 WT virus) (Piccoli et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020), as well as
clinical-stage mAbs REGN10933, REGN10987, LY-CoV555, and S309 (the parent of VIR7831) (Baum et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020). 15.5%
of these mAbs demonstrated a >2-fold reduction of RBD binding in response to the N439K
mutation (Figures 5C-D and S4). For comparison, we also evaluated the K417V mutation
which eliminates one salt bridge at the RBM:hACE2 interface and the N439K/K417V
double mutation. A similar percentage (12.8% for K417V vs 15.5% for N439K) of mAbs lost
>2-fold binding to these variants, including several (13.5%) which were not sensitive to
either single mutant but were sensitive to the double mutant (Figures 5C-D). The reduced
binding of mAbs to these RBD mutants were also confirmed by bio-layer interferometry
analysis (BLI) (Figures 5E and S5A).
To define the potential biological importance of these mutations for evasion of
antibody-mediated neutralization, we tested mAbs against pseudoviruses expressing S
variants N439K, K417V or N439K/K417V (Figures 5F-H and S5B). Neutralization of
pseudoviruses containing these mutations was significantly diminished for certain mAbs,
including some that are in clinical development. As predicted by its non-RBM epitope
(Pinto et al., 2020), S309 was capable of neutralizing each of these variants. Sensitivity of
some neutralizing mAbs to mutations at these positions have also been reported in other
studies (Baum et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Weisblum et al., 2020)
but combinations of mutations have not typically been evaluated. Overall, our results
demonstrate that mutations compatible with viral fitness can result in immune evasion from
both monoclonal and polyclonal antibody responses.

DISCUSSION
The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, a critical epitope for vaccine response and
therapeutic mAbs, will depend on the fitness of RBM variants. The findings herein describe
an example of a naturally-occurring RBM variant which can evade antibody-mediated
immunity while maintaining fitness. Fitness of this variant, N439K, was demonstrated by
repeated emergence by convergent evolution, spread to multiple countries and significant
representation in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases, the fact that the N439K RBD
retains a high affinity interaction with the hACE2 receptor, efficient viral replication in
cultured cells, and no disease attenuation in a large cohort of infected individuals.
The fitness of N439K is consistent with our findings that the RBM is the most
divergent region of S. This divergence indicates an ability of SARS-CoV-2 to accommodate
mutations at the RBM while retaining the functional requirement of hACE2 binding, and is
likely to be linked to immune pressure from neutralizing Ab responses. There is precedent
for the most immunogenic region of a viral surface protein to be the fastest mutating
despite harboring the receptor binding site; for example, the immunogenic globular head
domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin surface protein, which contains the sialic acid
receptor binding site, evolves faster than the stalk region (Doud et al., 2018; Kirkpatrick et
al., 2018). The ability to accommodate mutations in the RBM indicates a high likelihood
that immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants compatible with fitness will continue to
emerge, with implications for reinfection, vaccines, and both monoclonal and polyclonal
antibody therapeutics.
In our profile of immune escape from the N439K variant, we observed resistance to
a mAb currently being evaluated in clinical trials as part of a two-mAb cocktail. The
promise of using cocktails of mAbs is that they should significantly lower the likelihood of
drug-induced selection of resistant viruses (Baum et al., 2020). However, if circulating viral
strains already carry resistant mutations to one antibody in the cocktail, this could reduce
the cocktail to a monotherapy. Additionally, considering the high level of plasticity of the
RBM demonstrated in the present study, there could be many combinations of RBM
mutations compatible with viral fitness while leading to immune escape. This is supported
by our result that N439K can compensate for a mutation (K417V) that otherwise decreases
receptor binding affinity (Figure 3D). This particular combination of mutations is plausibly
compatible with fitness as it parallels SARS-CoV RBM:hACE2 interactions (salt bridge at
SARS-CoV RBD position R426 and no salt bridge at V404, Figure 3A). Notably, several
mAbs which were not sensitive to these mutations individually were sensitive to them in
combination, including the two-mAb cocktail (Figure 5C-H).
We propose two approaches that will be critical for minimizing the impact of mAb
escape mutations. One is to develop mAbs with epitopes that are highly resistant to viral
escape. This may include epitopes outside of the RBM and/or epitopes that are crossreactive across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, indicating conserved epitopes with a low
tolerance for mutation (Pinto et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020a). A
comparison of epitopes of RBM-targeting mAbs with the most conserved regions of the
RBM (Figure 1C) may also identify RBM mAbs with a higher barrier to escape. The
second approach is to screen patients, likely at the population level, for the presence of
potential resistance variants prior to drug administration. The availability of multiple

different mAb therapeutics in the clinic could provide the opportunity to tailor the choice of
therapeutic to local circulating variants.
In general, given that access to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies via clinical trials
and emergency use authorization is expanding, and as more people develop immune
responses to the wildtype virus, monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 will be
increasingly critical. Although SARS-CoV-2 is evolving slowly and at present should be
controllable by a single vaccine (Dearlove et al., 2020), variation accumulating in the RBM
could put this at risk, especially for individuals with a moderate Ab response to vaccination
or infection. While we only report on evasion of antibody-mediated immunity here, it would
be surprising to us if similar changes are not observed to evade T cell immunity and innate
immunity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample donors
Samples from 439 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were obtained from the Ticino
healthcare workers cohort (Switzerland), described previously (Piccoli et al., 2020), and
under study protocols approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Canton Ticino
Ethics Committee, Switzerland). All donors provided written informed consent for the use
of blood and blood components (such as PBMCs, sera or plasma). In the Ticino region of
Switzerland and during the time period of collection (February-March 2020) no N439K
SARS-CoV-2 isolates were reported.
Samples from six N439K variant infected individuals were obtained from the
ISARIC4C consortium (https://isaric4c.net/). Ethical approval was given by the South
Central-Oxford C Research Ethics Committee in England (reference 13/SC/0149), and by
the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/SS/0028). The study was
registered at https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN66726260.
Residual nucleic acid extracts derived from the nose-throat swabs of 1918 SARSCoV-2 positive individuals whose diagnostic samples were submitted to the West of

Structural analysis
RBM residues were determined based on the RBD:ACE2 complex crystal structures
2AJF for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) and 6M0J for SARS-CoV-2 (Lan et al., 2020). The
2AJF structure was obtained from the PDB-REDO server (pdb-redo.eu) and was
subsequently prepared in the molecular modeling software MOE (v2019.0102,
https://www.chemcomp.com) using the structure preparation, protonation and energy
minimization steps with default settings. RBD residues within 6.0A distance of any ACE2
atoms (determined using MOE) were determined for each of the two copies of the complex
in the asymmetric unit, and then were combined to obtain the RBM. 6M0J was obtained
from the Coronavirus Structural Task Force server (https://github.com/thornlab/coronavirus_structural_task_force) and was further refined (using Refmac5 v5.8.0258),
manually fitted (using Coot v0.9) and prepared (using MOE, as described above) in
multiple iterative cycles. The final structure was analyzed for RBD-ACE2 contact residues
with a 6.0A cutoff to obtain the RBM (using MOE). The final list of RBM residues (Figure
1C) was arrived at by combining the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 results.
Using MOE, the pairwise binding energy between each residue in SARS-CoV-2
RBD and each residue in ACE2, and the total binding energy for all interactions, was
determined at cutoff distances 3.0A, 3.5A, 4.0A, 4.5A, 5.0A, 5.5A, 6.0A, 6.5A and 7.0A.
The percentage of the total binding energy for each interacting RBD residue was
calculated for each distance cutoff and was then averaged over all cutoffs. The resulting
values are shown in green in Figure 1C.
Determining conservation from deposited GISAID sequences
Differential accumulation of amino acid variants in the RBM, RBD or Spike protein
was computed taking into account only the presence or absence of a variant at any
residue. Each variant called present counts one. A variant is called present if there are at
least X number of supporting sequences deposited in GISAID, where X varies from 2 to
20. The number of variants is then normalized to the size of the domain (number of
residues).
Evaluation of deep mutational scanning (DMS) data
DMS data was retrieved from (Starr et al., 2020). Variant-level DMS scores were
aggregated to residue-level by taking the minimum (most disruptive variant) or the average
score across all variants of a residue, except for the reference residue and the stop codon.
Alternatively, minimum and average scores are computed only across variants that have
been observed as naturally occurring. Data were represented as a heatmap annotated
with: frequency of non-reference amino acids in deposited GISAID sequences (n ≈
130,000, at least 4 sequences were required to call a variant as present), in Log10 scale;
number of countries in which a variant was observed; and percentage of total binding
energy computed from an X-ray crystal structure (cf. structural analysis methods section).

Recombinant glycoprotein production
Prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants (residues 14-1211,
containing the 2P and Furin cleavage site mutations (Walls et al., 2020) with a muphosphatase signal sequence and a C-terminal Avi-8xHis-EPEA-tag in a pD2610-V5
vector (ATUM Bio) were expressed in Expi293F cells at 37°C and 8% CO2 according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell culture supernatant was
collected after four days and purified over a 5 mL C-tag affinity matrix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Elution fractions were concentrated and injected on a Superose 6 Increase
10/300 GL column with 1x PBS pH 7.4 as running buffer.
SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants (residues 328-531 with a C-terminal thrombin-cleavage
site-TwinStrep-8xHis-tag, and N-terminal signal sequence) were expressed in Expi293F
cells at 37°C and 8% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Transfection was performed using
ExpiFectamine 293 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell culture supernatant was
collected three days after transfection and supplemented with 10x PBS to a final
concentration of 2.5x PBS (342.5 mM NaCl, 6.75 mM KCl and 29.75 mM phosphates), or
3.2x for RBD N439R. SARS-CoV-2 RBDs were purified using 1 or 5 ml HisTALON
superflow cartridges (Takara Bio) and subsequently buffer exchanged into Cytiva 1x HBSN buffer or PBS.
RBDs from other sarbecoviruses were expressed in Expi293F cells at 37°C and 8%
CO2. Cells were transfected using PEI MAX. Cell culture supernatant was collected seven
days after transfection. Proteins were purified using a 5 ml Strep-Tactin XT Superflow high
capacity cartridge followed by buffer exchange to PBS using HiPrep 26/10 desalting
columns.
For S binding measurements, recombinant ACE2 (residues 19-615 from Uniprot
Q9BYF1 with a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site-TwinStrep-10xHis-GGG-tag, and Nterminal signal sequence) was expressed in Expi293 cells at 37°C and 8% CO2 in a
humified incubator. Transfection was performed using ExpiFectamine 293 reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell culture supernatant was collected seven days after
transfection, supplemented with buffer to a final concentration of 80 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
100 mM NaCl, and then incubated with BioLock solution for one hour. After filtration
through a 0.22 µm filter, ACE2 was purified using a 1 ml StrepTrap HP column (Cytiva)
followed by isolation of the monomeric ACE2 by size exclusion chromatography using a
Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated in PBS (Gibco 10010-023).
For binding measurements with surface-captured RBD, recombinant ACE2
(residues 19-615 from Uniprot Q9BYF1 with a C-terminal AviTag-10xHis-GGG-tag, and Nterminal signal sequence) was expressed in HEK293.sus using standard methods (ATUM
Bio). Protein was purified via Ni Sepharose resin followed by isolation of the monomeric
ACE2 by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL
column pre-equilibrated with PBS.
For binding measurements with surface-captured ACE2, recombinant ACE2
(residues 18-615 with a C-terminal GS-IgG2a-Mm-Fc tag, and N-terminal signal sequence)
was stably transfected in CHO-K1 GS knock-down cell line (ATUM Bio). Protein was
purified via protein A and buffer exchanged into PBS.

Binding measurements using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
SPR binding measurements were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument. S
protein was surface captured via anti-AviTag pAb covalently immobilized on a CM5 chip,
RBD protein was surface captured via StrepTactin XT covalently immobilized on a CM5
chip, and ACE2-mFc was surface captured via covalent immobilization of the Cytiva
Mouse antibody capture kit on a C1 chip. Running buffer was Cytiva HBS-EP+ (pH 7.4)
and all measurements were performed at 25 °C. All experiments were performed as singlecycle kinetics, with a 3-fold dilution series of monomeric ACE2 starting from 300 nM, each
concentration injected for 180 sec, or a 3-fold dilution series of RBD starting from 50 nM,
each concentration injected for 240 sec. All data were double reference-subtracted and fit
to a binding model using Biacore Evaluation software. For one representative replicate,
capture levels were normalized to WT for visualization. Binding data with ACE2 as analyte
were fit to a 1:1 binding model. Binding data with RBD as analyte were fit to a
Heterogeneous Ligand binding model, due to an artifactual kinetic phase with very slow
dissociation that arises when RBD is an analyte; the lower affinity of the two KDs reported
by the fit is reported as the KD of the RBD-ACE2 interaction (the two reported KDs are
separated by at least two orders of magnitude for all fits). The measured KD for ACE2
binding to S is likely influenced by conformational dynamics of the RBDs in the context of
the prefusion S trimer. Reported KDs are an average of 3-4 replicates measured on at least
two separate days, with error given as SEM.
Epidemiological and genome surveillance
A national sequencing collaboration formed at the start of the epidemic in the UK,
CoG-UK consortium (consortiumcontact@cogconsortium.uk, 2020), has facilitated the
tracking of SARS-CoV-2 sequences across Scotland since the start of the outbreak in
February 2020 (6,825 sequences by Oct 6, 2020) and real-time monitoring of genetic
changes in the Spike gene that might be associated with changes in virulence or
transmissibility. Sequencing was carried out using an amplicon-based protocol in real-time
at a rate of up to 300 genomes per week. 50% of samples were selected as surveillance
samples, representing Scottish health boards proportionately based on population size,
while 50% were selected to allow intervention with local issues such as nosocomial
infection in hospitals and nursing homes. A gradual increase in the prevalence of the
N439K polymorphism was noted to become increasingly prevalent during April 2020. This
was noted to be particularly common in the Greater Glasgow & Clyde NHS health board
region but spread to adjacent Scottish health boards also.
Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the ARTIC nCoV-2019 described
in detail at https://artic.network/ncov-2019. Briefly, PCR amplicons were generated using
the nCoV-2019 PrimalSeq sequencing primers using 25-35 cycles of amplification.
Generated amplicons were used to prepare either Oxford Nanopore or Illumina sequencing
libraries. Oxford Nanopore libraries were prepared as described in the link above and
sequenced in a flow cell R9.4.1 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Part Number FLOMIN106D), using MinKNOW version 19.12.6. Raw FAST5 files were basecalled using
Guppy version 3.2.10 in high accuracy mode with a minimum quality score of 7. Reads
were size filtered, demultiplexed and trimmed with Porechop

(https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), and mapped against reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1
(MN908947). Variants were called using Nanopolish 0.11.3 and accepted if they had a loglikelihood score of greater than 200 and minimum read coverage of 20. For Illumina
sequencing, amplicons were used to prepare libraries using the Kapa HyperPrep kit (Kapa
Biosystems, Part Number KK8504) and further processed as described in the competition
assay sequencing method. Sequencing was carried out on Illumina’s MiSeq system
(Illumina, Part Number SY-410-1003) using a MiSeq Reagent v2 500 cycle kit (Illumina,
Part Number MS-102-2003). Reads were trimmed with trim_galore
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) and mapped with BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009)) to the Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947) reference sequence, followed by
primer trimming and consensus calling with iVar (Grubaugh et al., 2019) and a minimum
read coverage of 10.
Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis
UK sequences were obtained from the COG-UK
consortium, https://www.cogconsortium.uk. Global sequences were obtained from the
GISAID Initiative, https://www.gisaid.org on Oct 19 2020. The sequences were mapped
using minimap2 and padded against the Wuhan/WH04/2020 reference. The sequences
were downsampled with weights that normalise sequence count per epiweek, maximise
the number of countries and lineages represented, and enriching for sequences with the
N439K mutation. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE
with the the following parameters: -czb -blmin 0.0000000001 -m HKY --runs 5 and all other
parameters set to default. The tree was visualised with custom python code using the
baltic library, https://github.com/evogytis/baltic.
For the phylodynamic analysis, Scottish “introduction” lineages were identified
(Lycett et al., 2020, in prep and see http://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/RiseFallScotCOVID), and the
skygrowth package in R was used to estimate the effective population size over time, and
the growth rate of the lineage within Scotland (Volz and Frost, 2017).
Evaluation of clinical samples
Clinical samples submitted to the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre for
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic rt-PCR testing were selected for sequencing as part of the
COVID-19 UK Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) project, resulting in 1918 whole
genome sequences originating from the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board
region. Sequences were linked to electronic patient records and basic metadata including
sample date, age, sex, admission to hospital and mortality at 28 days post diagnosis
extracted. The electronic patient records of a subset of 1591 patients underwent full casenote review and clinical severity was recorded based on a 4-level ordinal scale: 1. no
requirement for respiratory support, 2. treatment with supplemental oxygen via facemask
or low-flow nasal cannulae, 3. intubation and ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or oxygen
delivery by high flow nasal cannulae devices, 4. death within the 28 days following
diagnosis. We modified the WHO ordinal scale to these 4 points as described previously
(Volz et al., 2020) to avoid using hospitalisation as a criterion of severity because 1) many
patients in nursing homes had severe infection but were not admitted to hospital, and 2)

early in the outbreak, all cases were hospitalised irrespective of the severity of their
infection.
These data had previously been analysed to test for an effect of the D614G
mutation on the severity of disease (Volz et al., 2020); we extend that analysis here using
the same methodology to test for an effect of the N439K mutation. Additionally, we perform
a new analysis using a model with the same structure to test for an effect of both the
D614G mutation and the D614G/N439K mutation combination on the viral load of infected
patients, as measured by cycle threshold value. In both cases we cannot estimate the
marginal effect of the N439K mutation, as we only have the mutation on the 614G genetic
background, so the individual effect of N439K cannot be separated from any potential
epistatic interactions between the mutations.
Briefly, the structure of the model used previously (Volz et al., 2020) and in the
present study is a phylogenetic generalised additive model with mutation being the primary
predictor of interest. The model controls for biological sex, age and the number of days
since the first reported case in the dataset, with the latter two being included as penalised
splines with a maximum of 30 knots. If the patient was part of a cluster of cases, this was
included as a random effect, with individuals not part of clusters being assigned their own
levels. Correlations driven by the rest of the genome are controlled for by a phylogenetic
random effect using a correlation matrix generated under a Brownian motion assumption
from a phylogeny estimated in IQ-TREE 2 v. 2.0.6 (Minh et al., 2020) using a HKY + Γ
model, masking the positions recommended by De Maio et al. as of 22/7/2020
(https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473/13), rooted on the first
sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome (Wu et al., 2020). The priors for the severity model were
those used in the previous analysis of this data. The priors for the model of the viral load
were a student-t (mean = 20, scale = 10, degrees of freedom = 3) prior on the model
intercept, a Gaussian (mean = 0, standard deviation = 10) prior over the fixed effects, and
an exponential (lambda = 0.1) prior over the random effect, penalised spline and residual
standard deviations.
There are two key structural differences between the model used previously (Volz et
al., 2020) and the model used here. Firstly, mutation is a three level rather than two level
factor (D614/N439, D614G/N439 and D614G/N439K) with the ancestral D614/N439 being
the reference level. Secondly, as we are now interested in two mutations, we estimated the
phylogeny used to control for the effect of the rest of the genome excluding both the
nucleotide position underlying the D614G mutation and the nucleotide position underlying
the N439K mutation (in addition to the sites from De Maio et al mentioned above).
The severity model used a cumulative error structure while the model on the CT
values used a Gaussian error structure. In both cases, the models were estimated in brms
v. 2.13.5 (Bürkner, 2018) . The presented models had no divergent transitions, Rhat values
less than 1.01, and appropriate bulk and tail effective sample sizes for all parameters.
Shortest probability intervals were calculated using the R package SPIn v. 1.1 (Liu et al.,
2015). Analysis code is available at https://github.com/dpascall/SARS-CoV-2-mutationanalysis.

qPCR of clinical samples
All samples were tested in duplicate using the 2019-nCoV_N1 assay RT-qPCR
assay (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). Ready-mixed primers and probe
were obtained from IDT (Leuven, Belgium). PCR was carried out using NEB Luna
Universal Probe One-Step Reaction Mix and Enzyme Mix (New England Biolabs, Herts,
UK), primers and probe at 500 nM and 127.5 nM, respectively, and 5 µl of RNA sample in
a final volume of 20 µl. No template negative controls were included after every seventh
sample. Six ten-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards were tested in duplicate in
each assay; standards were calibrated using a plasmid containing the N sequence that
had been quantified using droplet digital PCR. Thermal cycling was performed on an
Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast PCR instrument running SDS software v2.3
(ThermoFisher Scientific) under the following conditions: 55 °C for 10 minutes and 95 °C
for 1 minute followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 58 °C for 1 minute. Assays were
repeated if the reaction efficiency was <90% or the R2 value of the standard curve was
≤0.998. Where possible, testing of samples was repeated if the %CV of the duplicates was
<10%.
Viral growth curve
VeroE6-ACE2 cells (VeroE6 cells induced to overexpress Ace2) either with or
without TMPRSS2 overexpression (Rhin et al., 2020 under review) were seeded in a 12well plate and inoculated with an MOI of 0.01 with either the GLA1 (N439/D614G) or GLA2
(N439K/D614G) virus isolates for 1hr before washing the cells three times in PBS and
replacing with 2% DMEM. 100ul of media was removed at each timepoint, RNA
was extracted, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 determined using 2019-nCOV-N1 assays
(IDT) with an NEB Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit. A standard curve was
used to determine the copy number present per ml of cell culture media. 100ul of the fresh
media was also tested for the presence of virus, which was undetectable in all wells.
Competition assay
Three T25 Flasks were seeded with VeroE6-Ace2 or VeroE6-Ace2-TMPRSS2 and
inoculated with either single viruses or both GLA1 and GLA2 virus strains at an MOI of
0.01 for 1 hr. The flasks were washed three times with PBS, with 100 ul of the final wash
being retained to determine the presence of free virus, before adding 5 ml of fresh 2%
DMEM. At 24, 48, and 72 hrs, 500 ul of media was removed, which was replaced with 500
ul fresh media. 300 ul was used for RNA extraction and NGS analysis of the frequencies of
the specific positions within the spike protein. The single virus inoculations showed no
alternations in the frequency of the amino acid positions and the final wash showing no
free virus in the supernatant. We used an unbiased metagenomic NGS sequencing
pipeline to quantify variation across the whole viral genome on the Illumina NGS Next Seq
platform. Briefly, extracted nucleic acid was incubated with DNaseI (Thermo Fisher, Part
Number AM2222) followed by cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III (Thermo Scientific,
Part Number 18080044) and NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand
Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs, Part Number E6111L). Samples were further

processed using the Kapa LTP Library Preparation Kit for Illumina Platforms (Kapa
Biosystems, Part Number KK8232) and indexed with the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for
Illumina 96 Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs (New England Biolabs, Part Number E6442S).
Libraries were sequenced on Illumina’s NextSeq 550 System (Illumina, Part Number SY415-1002), generating 10 million pairs of reads per sample.
Ab discovery and recombinant expression
Human mAbs were isolated from plasma cells or memory B cells of SARS-CoV or
SARS-CoV-2 immune donors, as previously described (Corti et al., 2011; Pinto et al.,
2020; Tortorici et al., 2020). LY-CoV555 mAb was obtained from Eli Lilly and Company.
REGN10933 and REGN10987 mAbs were produced recombinantly based on published
sequences (Hansen et al., 2020).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
A total of 148 human monoclonal antibodies or 445 human sera were tested for
binding to RBD WT and mutants. Spectraplate-384 plates with high protein binding
treatment (custom made from Perkin Elmer) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 µg/ml
(for mAbs) or 5 ug/ml (for sera) SARS-CoV-2 RBD WT, N439K, K417V or N439K/K417V in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. Plates were subsequently blocked with Blocker
Casein 1% supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room
temperature. The coated plates were incubated with serial dilutions of the monoclonal
antibodies or of the sera for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed with
PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T), and alkaline phosphatase-goat anti-human IgG
(Southern Biotech) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washing
steps with PBS-T, P-NitroPhenyl Phosphate (pNPP, Sigma-Aldrich) substrate was added
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance of 405 nm was measured
by a microplate reader (Biotek). Fitting was performed using a 4-parameter logistic (4PL)
model, yielding dose-response curves from which the area under the curve (AUC) between
5 and 500 ng/ml was computed. The AUC allows to capture, in a single metric, shifts of
interest in two parameters of the 4PL model: EC50 and upper asymptote.
Binding measurements using BLI
BLI binding measurement was performed on a selection of human monoclonal
antibodies tested by ELISA. Antibodies were diluted to 2.7 µg/ml in kinetic buffer (PBS
supplemented with 0.05% BSA) and immobilized on Protein A Biosensors of an Octet
RED96 system (FortéBio). Antibody-coated biosensors were incubated for 5 min with a
solution containing 5 µg /ml of SARS-CoV2 RBD WT, N439K, K417V or N439/K417V in
kinetic buffer. A dissociation step was then performed by incubating the biosensors for
5 min in kinetic buffer. Change in molecules bound to the biosensors caused a shift in the
interference pattern that was recorded in real time and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8
software.

VSV Pseudovirus generation
Replication defective VSV pseudovirus (Takada et al., 1997) expressing SARSCoV-2 spike protein were generated as previously described (Riblett et al., 2016) with
some modifications. Plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike variants were generated by
site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)-spike-D19 (Giroglou et
al., 2004). Lenti-X™ 293T cells (Takara, 632180) were seeded in 10-cm dishes at a
density of 1e5 cells/cm2 and the following day transfected with 5 µg of spike expression
plasmid with TransIT-Lenti (Mirus, 6600) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One
day post-transfection, cells were infected with VSV-luc (VSV-G) (Kerafast, EH1020-PM) for
1 h, rinsed three times with PBS, then incubated for an additional 24 h in complete media
at 37°C. The cell supernatant was clarified by centrifugation, filtered (0.45 µm), aliquoted,
and frozen at -80°C.
Pseudovirus neutralizations
Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were seeded into clear bottom white 96 well plates
(Costar, 3903) at a density of 2e4 cells per well. The next day, mAbs were serially diluted
in pre-warmed complete media, mixed at a 1:1 ratio with pseudovirus and incubated for 1 h
at 37°C in round bottom polypropylene plates. Media from cells was aspirated and 50 µL of
virus-mAb complexes were added to cells and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. An
additional 100 µL of prewarmed complete media was then added on top of complexes and
cells incubated for an additional 16-24 h. Conditions were tested in duplicate wells on each
plate and at least six wells per plate contained uninfected, untreated cells (mock) and
infected, untreated cells (‘no mAb control’). Virus-mAb-containing media was then
aspirated from cells and 100 mL of a 1:4 dilution of Bio-glo (Promega, G7940) in PBS was
added to cells. Plates were incubated for 10 mins at room temperature and then were
analyzed on the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Relative light units (RLUs) for
infected wells were subtracted by the average of RLU values for the mock wells
(background subtraction) and then normalized to the average of background subtracted
“no mAb control” RLU values within each plate. Percent neutralization was calculated by
subtracting from 1 the normalized mAb infection condition. Data were analyzed and
visualized with Prism (Version 8.4.3). IC50 curves were calculated from the interpolated
value from the log(inhibitor) vs. response – variable slope (four parameters) nonlinear
regression with an upper constraint of <100. Each neutralization infection was conducted
on three independent days.

Figure 1. The RBM exhibits significant natural diversity in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates
(GISAID, Oct 7, 2020, n≈130,000).
(A) RBD variants with a minimum of 10 observed isolates in the RBM (blue) and outside the RBM (gray)
mapped onto an X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB ID: 6M0J).
(B) Number of observed variants in three non-overlapping S regions (RBM, non-RBM RBD, non-RBD S)
normalized by the total number of residues in each region, where the number of observed isolates
required to define a variant is varied. Inset: barplot representation where at least 10 isolates are observed
per variant.
(C) Heatmap of Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) hACE2 binding and expression data for RBM residues
(Starr et al., 2020). DMS score is the binding or expression fold change over WT on a Log10 scale.
Aggregated DMS data is shown for each residue by taking the minimum (most disruptive variant) or the
average score across all possible variants of a residue, except for the reference residue and the stop
codon (‘mutagenesis’ columns). Alternatively, minimum and average scores are computed only across
variants that have naturally occurred (‘observed variants’ columns). When no natural variants have been
observed, cells are grey. The heatmap is annotated with frequency of non-reference amino acids in
deposited sequences (at least 4 sequences were required to call a variant), in Log10 scale; number of
countries in which a variant was observed; and percentage of total binding energy between RBD and
hACE2 computed from an X-ray crystal structure. Data were sorted on the leftmost DMS column.

lineages
(A) Phylogenetic tree showing relationship between all global SARS-CoV-2 variants as of Oct 6, 2020,
with N439K variants highlighted in orange circles. Two significant N439K lineages, one in Scotland (blue box)
and one in multiple European countries (light orange box), each >500 sequences, have been detected to date.
The N439K mutation has also been detected independently in the US in four linked infections and in several
incidental infections. Vertical bars indicate global lineage, presence of N439K (orange), or presence of D614G
(light orange).
(B) Growth of the N439K lineages relative to sampling time and their country of occurrence. The emergence
of the European lineage in Scotland is denoted as Scotland (ii).
(C) Growth of the two N439K lineages over time (top panels) and their relative contributions (lower panels) in
Scotland, England and the Republic of Ireland.

Figure 3. N439K enhances RBD affinity for hACE2, likely by formation of a new salt bridge
at the RBD:hACE2 binding interface
(A-B) X-ray structures of the (A) SARS-CoV and (B) SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with hACE2
(based on 2AJF and 6M0J, respectively). Interface salt bridge residues are shown as sticks.
SARS-CoV-2 salt bridge RBD E484:hACE2 K31 is not labeled. hACE2 is shown in orange and
RBD in gray.
(C) SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with hACE2 highlighting the observed K417:D30 salt bridge
and the putative K439:E329 salt bridge, which was modeled in-silico.
(D) Binding affinity of RBD and Spike variants for hACE2 measured by surface plasmon
resonance. Monomeric hACE2 is injected successively at 11, 33, 100 and 300 nM onto surfacecaptured spike ECD or RBD; alternately, RBD is injected successively at 3.1, 12.5 and 50 nM
onto surface-captured hACE2. All spike ECD contain the D614G mutation. Bar graph – Affinity
measurements (averages of 3-4 replicates) expressed as a fold change relative to WT binding
within each experiment format. WT KD values measured as: 95 ± 1.6 nM (Spike surface), 63 ± 1.0
nM (RBD surface), 19 ± 3.3 nM (ACE2 surface); errors are SEM.

Figure 4. Clinical outcomes and virological evaluation of the ‘Scottish’ N439K lineage indicate
maintenance of fitness relative to WT virus
(A) Epidemiological growth of the D614/N439, D614G/N439 or D614G/N439K virus in the NHS Greater
Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area (NHS GGC) relative to sampling time in epi weeks (top) and
their relative contributions (bottom) for 1918 patients whose diagnostic samples were sequenced.
(B) Top – Real-time PCR data for N439/D614, N439/D614G and N439K/D614G groups, same patient
population as in (A). The N439K genotype was associated with marginally lower Ct values than the
N439 genotype (posterior mean Ct value difference between N439K/D614G and N439/D614G: -0.65,
95% CI: -1.22, -0.07). Bottom – Correlation between Ct and quantitative viral load.
(C) Severity of disease within NHS GGC for a subset of 1591 patients. Ordinal scale scored by
requirement for supplementary oxygen: 1. No respiratory support, 2: Supplemental oxygen, 3: Invasive
or non-invasive ventilation or oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannulae, 4: Death. Analysis based
on the ordinal scale indicated that the N439K viral genotype was associated with similar clinical
outcomes compared to the N439 genotype (posterior mean: 0.06, 95% CI: -1.21, 1.33).
(D) Growth curves for GLA1 (N439/D614G) or GLA2 (N439K/D614G) virus isolates in VeroE6-ACE2
cells either with or without TMPRSS2 expression.
(E) Competition of GLA1 and GLA2 virus isolates for growth in VeroE6-ACE2 cells either with or
without TMPRSS2 expression, after inoculation at a matched MOI. Quantification was by tracking the
frequency of N439K within the spike gene using metagenomic NGS.

antibodies and sera
(A-B) Binding of serum and plasma samples from 445 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals
against WT and N439K RBD, plotted as (A) ELISA AUC for each RBD and (B) fold change
relative to WT. Blue dots indicate sera with at least 2-fold loss of binding to the N439K RBD
variant as compared to WT. Purple dots indicate sera from individuals infected with SARSCoV-2 N439K variant.
(C-D) Binding of 144 mAbs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals plus four clinical-stage
mAbs against WT, N439K, K417V, and N439K/K417V RBD, plotted as (C) ELISA AUC for
each RBD and (D) fold change relative to WT. For all, the non-gray dots/lines indicate mAbs
demonstrating at least 2-fold loss of binding to the variant RBD as compared to WT; for
N439K/K417V, the mAbs corresponding to red-colored dots/lines also show a loss of binding
to one of the single-site variants, whereas the mAbs corresponding to black lines/whitecolored dots only lose binding to the double mutant.
(E) Binding to RBD variants by Octet for four of the mAbs tested.
(F) Neutralization of four VSV-pseudovirus strains by four of the mAbs tested.
(G) Bar graph: Neutralization results for all mAbs tested, expressed as a fold-change relative
to D614G (all strains are in the background of D614G). Black dots: IC50 of neutralization of
D614G.
(H) Correlation of ELISA-binding fold change and Neutralization fold change for each variant
relative to WT (where a smaller ELISA AUC and therefore a smaller ratio represents loss of
binding, and a larger IC50 and therefore a larger ratio represents loss of neutralization)

RBM divergence
(A) Top – Pairwise similarity to SARS-CoV-2 (sliding window size of 30 amino acids) for
seven related Sarbecoviruses (see figure key) across the RBD region of the Spike protein.
Bottom – Site-specific entropy plot across the RBD protein alignment of SARS-CoV-2 and 68
related viruses (Data S1). Entropy for each position l (H(l)) was calculated using Shannon’s
entropy formula with a natural log as implemented in Bioedit (H(l) = -Σf(a,l)ln(f(a,l)); f(a,l) being
the frequency of amino acid a at position l). Sites constituting the RBM are annotated in blue;
the x-axis refers to absolute positions in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence. Right –
box plot of site-specific entropy values for the RBM sites (blue) and remaining non-RBM RBD
sites (gray).
(B) Sequence alignment (left) and identity for RBM and RBD (right) to SARS-CoV-2 of the
RBD sequences showing binding to hACE2. RBM residues indicated by blue boxes.
(C) Binding of hACE2 to human, pangolin and bat Sarbecovirus RBDs by BLI. Bat CoV
RaTG13, Bat CoVs ZC45, BtKY72 and BGR2008 have also been tested and did not bind
hACE2.

Figure S5B. VSV pseudovirus neutralization curves of all mAbs tested.
Representative of n=3, bars = STD

Table S1. Details of the sarbecovirus sequences used for Figure S1. The top 8
sequences shaded in gray were used for the similarity plot and all 69
sequences were used for the entropy plot.

Table S2 Parameter estimates on the link scale from the model estimating the impact
of the N439K mutation on the Ct value of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in
Scotland. Credible intervals represent 95% the shortest posterior density intervals.
The difference between D614G/N349 and D614G/N349K was estimated by direct
subtraction of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samples of the D614G/N349K estimate
from the D614G/N349 estimate. Ct value did not appear strongly correlated with
biological sex or age after controlling for the other factors. Patients infected with
related viral genomes had correlated Ct values at testing potentially implying that
there are other undescribed mutations in the genome that are affecting the viral load.

Table S3 Parameter estimates on the link scale from the model estimating the impact
of the N439K mutation on the severity of infection of patients infected with SARS-CoV2 in Scotland. Credible intervals represent 95% the shortest posterior density intervals.
Thresholds correspond to the positions of the boundaries between the different
severity classes.
