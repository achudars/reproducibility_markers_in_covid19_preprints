Abstract

14

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determined the

15

X-ray crystal structure of a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV30, isolated from a patient

16

infected with SARS-CoV-2, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD). The structure reveals

17

CV30’s epitope overlaps with the human ACE2 receptor binding site thus providing the structural basis

18

for its neutralization by preventing ACE2 binding.

Main

22

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization1. As of June 11th,

23

2020, there were ~ 7.4 M infections and over 415,000 deaths worldwide2. It is caused by a coronavirus

24

of the beta family, named SARS-CoV-23, as it is closely related to SARS-CoV4. Their genomes share 80%

25

identity and they utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor for entry5-11. Viral entry

26

depends on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, a class I fusion protein comprised of two subunits, S1

27

and S2. S1 mediates ACE2 binding through the receptor binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit

28

mediates fusion. Overall the spike shares 76% amino acid sequence homology with SARS4. High

29

resolutions structures of the SARS-CoV-2 stabilized spike in the prefusion revealed that the RBD can be

30

seen in a ‘up’ or ‘down’ conformation5,6.It‘s been shown that some of the neutralizing antibodies bind

31

the RBD in the ‘up’ conformation similar to when the ACE2 receptor binds12. Currently there is no

32

vaccine available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and highly effective therapeutics have not been

33

developed yet either. The host immune response to this new coronavirus is also not well understood.

34

We, and others, sought to characterize the humoral immune response from infected COVID-19

35

patients12-14. Recently, we isolated a neutralizing antibody, named CV30, which binds the receptor

36

binding domain (RBD), neutralizes with 0.03 μg/ml and competes binding with ACE215. However, the

37

molecular mechanism by which CV30 blocked ACE2 binding was unknown. Herein, we present the 2.75

38

Å crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with the Fab of CV30 (Extended Data Table 1).

39
40

CV30 binds almost exclusively to the concave ACE2 binding epitope (also known as the receptor binding

41

motif (RBM)) of the RBD using all six CDR loops with a total buried surface area of ~1004 Å2, ~750 Å2

42

from the heavy chain and ~254 Å2 from the kappa chain (Fig. 1A). 20 residues from heavy chains and 10

43

residues from the kappa chain interact with the RBD, forming 13 and 2 hydrogen bonds, respectively

44

(Fig. 1C and Extended Data Table 2). There are 29 residues from the RBD that interact with CV30, 19

45

residues with the heavy chain, 7 residues with the light chain, and 3 residues with both (Extended Data

46

Table 2). Of the 29 interacting residues from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, only 16 are conserved in the SARS-

47

CoV S protein RBD (Fig. 2c), which could explain the lack of cross-reactivity of CV30 to SARS-CoV S15. The

48

CV30 heavy chain is minimally mutated with only a two-residue change from the germline and both of

49

these residues (Val27-Ile28) are located in the CDRH1 and form nonpolar interactions with the RBD. We

50

reverted these residues to germline to assess their role. Interestingly, the germline CV30 (glCV30)

51

antibody bound to RBD with ~100-fold lower affinity (407 nM affinity) (Fig 1d and Extended Data Table

52

3) compared to CV30 (3.6 nM15) with a very large difference in the off-rate. glCV30 neutralized SARS-

53

CoV-2 with ~500-fold difference with an IC50 of 16.5 vs 0.03 μg/mL for CV30 (Fig. 1e). Val27 forms a

54

weak non-polar interaction with the RBD Asn487 and sits in a pocket formed by CDRH1 and 3. Although

55

it is unclear, Phe27 presents in glCV30 could change the electrostatic environment. The Ile28 sidechain

56

forms non-polar interactions with the RBD Gly476-Ser447, particularly the Cγ atom, which the glCV30

57

Thr would be incapable of making. Thus, minimal affinity maturation of CV30 significantly impacted the

58

ability of this mAb to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

59
60

CV30 competes with ACE2 for binding to the RBD15 and we therefore examined the structural

61

mechanism of the receptor blocking by superimposing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB: 6LZG)9

62

with the CV30 Fab/RBD complex. The structure of the RBD was used to align the two complexes and

63

showed that CV30 binding did not induce any conformational changes in the RBD from the ACE2-bound

64

complex. The aligned RBD had a RMSD of 0.353 Å over 166 Cα atoms. The structure reveals that the

65

CV30 epitope overlaps almost completely with the ACE2 epitope. A total of 26 residues of the SARS-CoV-

66

2 RBD interact with hACE2, CV30 binds to 19 of these residues (Fig. 2A), indicating that CV30 neutralizes

67

the virus by preventing the binding of ACE2 to RBD by direct steric interactions.

69

Recently, the structure of two potent neutralizing anti-RBD antibodies were published, B38 and CB612,14.

70

CV30 shares a similar germline heavy chain V-genes but all three have diverse germline kappa V-genes

71

(CV30 is IGKV3-20*01, B38 is IGKV1-9*01, CB6 is IGKV1-39*01, Extended Data Fig. 1). Both CV30 and

72

B38 use IGHV3-53*01 while CB6 uses IGHV3-66*01, which is only one amino acid different than 3-53*01

73

(Val12 which does not make contact with the epitope). CV30 and CB6 each have higher affinities, 3.6 nM

74

and 2.5 nM, respectively, than B38, 70.1 nM12,14,15. Differences in affinity translate into differences in

75

neutralization potency (the IC50s for CV30 and CB6 are 0.03 and 0.036 μg/mL, respectively, and that of

76

B38 is 0.177 μg/mL). Interestingly, Thr28 was also mutated from germline to Ile in B38 but Phe27 was

77

not. CB6 lacks both mutations found in CV30. Differences in other regions of the antibody, such as the

78

CDRH3 and light chain are likely responsible for the overall potency all these antibodies (see below). To

79

investigate the binding mechanism of the three antibodies, a superposition of the structures was

80

created. All three bind in a nearly identical manner with the same angle of approach and similar

81

footprints (Fig. 2b). The alignment of the Fv regions of B38 and CB6 to the Fv region of CV30 had a RMSD

82

of 0.240Å over 100 Cα atoms and 0.329Å over 98 Cα atoms, respectively. Mapping the binding

83

interactions of the RBD to each of the antibodies reveals a close overlap in the binding mechanism (Fig.

84

2c-d). The footprint of the heavy chain is nearly identical, as expected from the shared germline V-gene

85

and sequence similarity. CV30 and CB6 both have longer CDRH3 and bind with higher buried surface

86

area, ~263 and ~251 Å2, respectively, than B38 (~203 Å2) (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 1). The large

87

difference is in the light chain. CV30 has the smallest binding interaction at ~254 Å2, B38 has the largest

88

interaction at ~497 Å2 and then CB6 at ~354Å2. One of the more interesting findings was the interaction

89

of Thr56 in the CV30 CDRK2 which reaches across the RBD and interacts Phe486, an interaction that is

90

not found in the other two antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 1).

92

In conclusion, our structure indicates that potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 bind the

93

receptor binding motif in the RBD, overlapping the ACE2 binding site, but recognize residues that are

94

specific for SARS-CoV-2 only, thus explaining the lack of cross neutralization with SARS-CoV. It is

95

noteworthy that potently neutralizing antibodies isolated from multiple individuals use the same or

96

similar VH gene to target their epitope. Additionally, the minimal affinity maturation observed 21 days

97

after infection in the VH gene of CV30 showed ~100-500-fold increase in affinity and neutralization

98

potency, indicating that further affinity maturation may increase potency and potential cross-reactivity.

99

Our studies indicate that the RBD is a promising target for vaccine design and that these potently

100
101

neutralizing antibodies should be explored as a treatment for COVID-19 infection.

Methods

124

Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification

125

The plasmid encoding the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fused to a monomeric

126

Fc (pαH-RBD-Fc) has been previously described5 and was a gift from Dr. Jason McLellan.

127

1L of 293SGlycoDelete cells16 were cultured to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transiently transfected

128

with 500μg of pαH-RBD-Fc using 2 mg of polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences, Cat# 24765). Cultural

129

supernatant was harvested 6 days post-transfection by centrifugation and sterile filtered using a 0.22μm

130

vacuum filter. The RBD was purified using protein A agarose resin (GoldBio, Cat# P-400) and cleaving the

131

Fc domain using HRV3C protease (made in house) on-column. The eluate containing the RBD was further

132

purified by SEC using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated

133

in 2mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl. Protein was aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at -80°C until

134

needed.

136

500mL of 293EBNA cells were cultured to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transiently transfected with

137

125μg each of CV30 Heavy and Kappa chains using 1 mg of PEI. Cultural supernatant was harvested 6

138

days post-transfection by centrifugation and sterile filtered using a 0.22μm vacuum filter. IgG was

139

purified using protein A agarose resin and eluted using Pierce IgG Elution Buffer (Thermo Scientific, Cat#

140

21004). Eluate was pH adjusted to 7.5 using 1M HEPES, pH 7.5. IgG was further purified by SEC using a

141

HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column. Antigen binding fragment (Fab) was generated by incubating

142

IgG with LysC (New England Biolabs, Cat# P8109S) at a ratio of 1μg LysC per 10mg IgG at 37°C for 18hrs.

143

Fab unexpectedly stuck to protein A resin and was eluted as mixture of Fab, undigested IgG, and

144

digested Fc product using the IgG elution buffer. Fab and Fc product was purified by SEC. The CV30-Fab

145

and SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex was obtained my mixing Fab and Fc product with a 2-fold molar excess of

146

RBD and incubated for 90min at RT with nutation followed by SEC. The complex was verified by SDS-

147

PAGE analysis.

148
149

Crystal Screening and Structure Determination

150

The complex was concentrated to 10mg/mL for initial crystal screening by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion in

151

the MCSG Suite (Anatrace) using a NT8 drop setter (Formulatrix). Diffracting crystals were obtained in a

152

mother liquor (ML) containing 0.2M (NH4) Citrate, tribasic, pH 7.0 and 12% (w/v) PEG 3350. The crystals

153

were cryoprotected by soaking in ML supplemented with 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Diffraction data was

154

collected at Advanced Photon Source (APS) SBC 19-ID at a 12.662 keV. The data set was processed using

155

XDS17 to a resolution of 2.75Å. The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement using

156

Phaser18 with a search model of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDBid: 6lzg)9 and the Fab structure (PDBid: 5i1e)19

157

divided into Fv and Fc portions. Remaining model building was completed using COOT20 and refinement

was performed in Phenix21. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended

159

160

BLI

161

For kinetic analyses glCV30 was captured on anti-Human IgG Fc capture (AHC) sensors at a

162

concentration of 20 μg/mL and loaded for 100s. After loading, the baseline signal was then recorded for

163

1min in KB. The sensors were immersed into wells containing serial dilutions of purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD

164

in KB for 150s (association phase), followed by immersion in KB for an additional 600s (dissociation

165

phase). The background signal from each analyte-containing well was measured using VRC01 IgG control

166

reference sensors and subtracted from the signal obtained with each corresponding glCV30 loaded

167

sensor. Kinetic analyses were performed at least twice with an independently prepared analyte dilution

168

series. Curve fitting was performed using a 1:1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software.

169

Mean kon, koff values were determined by averaging all binding curves that matched the theoretical fit

170

with an R2 value of ≥0.98.

171

Neutralization Assay

172

HIV-1 derived viral particles were pseudotyped with full length wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S22. Briefly,

173

plasmids expressing the HIV-1 Gag and pol (pHDM540 Hgpm2), HIV-1Rev (pRC-CMV-rev1b), HIV-1 Tat

174

(pHDM-tat1b), the SARS-CoV-2 spike (pHDM-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ) and a luciferase/GFP reporter (pHAGE-

175

CMV-Luc2-IRES542 ZsGreen-W ) were co-transfected into 293T cells at a 1:1:1:1.6:4.6 ratio using 293

176

Free transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 72 hours later the culture

177

supernatant was harvested, clarified by centrifugation and frozen at -80˚C.

178

293 cells stably expressing ACE2 (HEK-293T-hACE2) were seeded at a density of 4x103 cells/well in a 100

179

µL volume in 96 well flat bottom tissue culture plates. The next day, CV30 and germline CV30 were

180

serially diluted in 30 µL of cDMEM in 96 well round bottom 27 plates in triplicate. An equal volume of

181

viral supernatant diluted to result in 2×105 luciferase units was added to each well and incubated for 60

182

min at 37 ˚C. Meanwhile 50 μL of cDMEM containing 6 µg/mL polybrene was added to each well of

183

293T-ACE2 cells (2 µg/mL final concentration) and incubated for 30 min. The media was aspirated from

184

293T-ACE2 cells and 100 µL of the virus-antibody mixture was added. The plates were incubated at 37˚C

185

for 72 hours. The supernatant was aspirated and replaced with 100 μL of Steadyglo luciferase reagent

186

(Promega). 75 µL was then transferred to an opaque, white bottom plate and read on a Fluorskan

187

Ascent Fluorimeter. Control wells containing virus but no antibody (cells + virus) and no virus or

188

antibody (cells only) were included on each plate.

189

% neutralization for each well was calculated as the RLU of the average of the cells + virus wells, minus

190

test wells (cells +mAb + virus), and dividing this result difference by the average RLU between virus

191

control (cells+ virus) and average RLU between wells containing cells alone, multiplied by 100. The

192

antibody concentration that neutralized 50% of infectivity (IC50) was interpolated from the

193

neutralization curves determined using the log(inhibitor) vs. response -- Variable slope (four

194

parameters) fit using automatic outlier detection in Graphpad Prism Software.
