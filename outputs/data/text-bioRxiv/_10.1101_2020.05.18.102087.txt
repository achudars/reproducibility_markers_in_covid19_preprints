Abstract
The coronavirus (CoV) viral host cell fusion spike (S) protein is the primary immunogenic target for virus
neutralization and the current focus of many vaccine design efforts. The highly flexible S-protein, with its
mobile domains, presents a moving target to the immune system. Here, to better understand S-protein
mobility, we implemented a structure-based vector analysis of available Œ≤-CoV S-protein structures. We found
that despite overall similarity in domain organization, different Œ≤-CoV strains display distinct S-protein
configurations. Based on this analysis, we developed two soluble ectodomain constructs in which the highly
immunogenic and mobile receptor binding domain (RBD) is locked in either the all-RBDs ‚Äòdown‚Äô position or is
induced to display a previously unobserved in SARS-CoV-2 2-RBDs ‚Äòup‚Äô configuration. These results
demonstrate that the conformation of the S-protein can be controlled via rational design and provide a
framework for the development of engineered coronavirus spike proteins for vaccine applications.

Introduction
The ongoing global pandemic of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2) coronavirus presents an urgent
need for the development of effective preventative and treatment therapies. The viral S-protein is a prime
target for such therapies owing to its critical role in the virus lifecycle. The S-protein is divided into two regions:
an N-terminal S1 domain that caps the C-terminal S2 fusion domain. Binding to host receptor via the Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD) in S1 is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the spike by host proteases1. Large
conformational changes in the S-protein result in S1 shedding and exposure of the fusion machinery in S2.
Class I fusion proteins, such as the CoV-2 S-protein, undergo large conformational changes during the fusion
process and must, by necessity, be highly flexible and dynamic. Indeed, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
structures of SARS-2 spike reveal considerable flexibility and dynamics in the S1 domain1,2, especially around
the RBD that exhibits two discrete conformational states ‚Äì a ‚Äòdown‚Äô state that is shielded from receptor binding,
and an ‚Äòup‚Äô state that is receptor-accessible.
The wealth of structural information for Œ≤-CoV spike proteins, including the recently determined cryoEM structures of the SARS-2 spike1-11, has provided a rich source of detailed geometric information from which
to begin precise examination of the macromolecular transitions underlying triggering of this fusion machine.

The transmembrane CoV S-protein spike trimer is composed of interwoven protomers that include an Nterminal receptor binding S1 domain and a C-terminal S2 domain that contains the fusion elements (Figure 1A
and B).2 The S1 domain is subdivided into the N-terminal domain (NTD) followed by the receptor binding
domain (RBD) and two structurally conserved subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Together these domains cap the
S2 domain, protecting the conserved fusion machinery. Several structures of soluble ectodomain constructs
that retain the complete S1 domain and the surface exposed S2 domain have been determined. These include
SARS-21,3, SARS4-8, MERS4,9, and other human2,10 and murine11 Œ≤-CoV spike proteins. These structures
revealed remarkable conformational heterogeneity in the S-protein spikes, especially in the RBD region. Within
a single protomer, the RBD could adopt a closed ‚Äòdown‚Äô state (Figure 1A), in which the RBD covers the apical
region of the S2 protein near the C-terminus of the first heptad repeat (HR1), or an open ‚Äòup‚Äô state in which the
RBD is dissociated from the apical central axis of S2 and the NTD. Further, cryo-EM structures strongly
suggest a large degree of domain flexibility in both the ‚Äòdown‚Äô and ‚Äòup‚Äô states in the NTD and RBD. While these
structures have provided essential information to identify the relative arrangement of these domains, the

degree to which conformational heterogeneity may be altered via mutation during the natural
evolution of the virus and in a vaccine immunogen design context remains to be determined.
In this study we have quantified the variability in the S1 and S2 geometric arrangements to reveal
important regions of flexibility to consider and to target for structure-based immunogen design. Based on these
analyses, we have designed mutations that alter the conformational distribution of the domains in the Sprotein. We visualized the effect of our designs using a structural determination pipeline relying first on single
particle analysis by negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) for rapid and low-cost assessment of the spike
ectodomains at low resolution, followed by cryo-EM for high-resolution information on the changes introduced
by these mutations. Our results reveal a heterogeneous conformational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
that is highly susceptible to modification by the introduction of mutations at sites of contact between the S1 and
S2 domains. We also present data on modified SARS-2 ectodomain constructs stabilized in conformations that
have not yet been seen in the current available structures, with great interest and direct application in vaccine
design.

Detailed structural schema defining the geometry and internal rearrangements of movable domains of the SARS2 spike.
To characterize the unique arrangement of distinct domains in the Œ≤-CoV spike, we first aimed to develop a
precise quantitative definition of their relative positions. Examination of available SARS and MERS S-protein
structures revealed: 1) the NTD and RBD subdomains and internal S2 domain move as rigid bodies, and 2)
these domains display a remarkable array of relative shifts between the domains in the S1 region and the S2
region‚Äôs Œ≤-sheet motif and connector domain (CD) (Figure 1B-F). In order to quantify these movements, we
have analyzed the relevant regions of motion and their structural disposition in all available Œ≤-CoV ectodomain
spike structures including 15 SARS4,5,7,8, 10 MERS4,12, a HKU12,10 , an OC432,10, a murine Œ≤-CoV, and three
SARS-213,14 structures (Figures 1E-F and 2). Each protomer in those structures displaying asymmetric
‚Äòup‚Äô/down‚Äô RBD states was examined independently yielding a dataset of 76 structural states. The NTD was
split into a primary N-terminal section and a secondary C-terminal section based upon visual inspection of this
region in the various Œ≤-CoV structures (Figures 1B-C and 2). We next analyzed S-protein geometry using a
vector-based approach. Specifically, vectors connecting each region‚Äôs CŒ± centroids were generated and used
to define the relative dispositions of the domains (Figure 1C and 2). The vector magnitudes and select angles
and dihedrals were used to identify the breadth of differences in domain positioning and compare between
strains. The results indicated that Œ≤-CoV spike proteins in various strains differ markedly from one another and
that considerable variability in the domain arrangements within strains exists, especially in the SARS
ectodomains (Figures 1E-F and 2A-H). In particular, both ùúΩ1 and …∏1 (Figure 2A-B), describing the angle
between the SD2 to SD1 and SD1 to RBD vectors as well as the SD1 to RBD dihedral, respectively, effectively
report on the ‚Äòup‚Äô and ‚Äòdown‚Äô configurations while indicating substantial differences between SARS and MERS
in both the ‚Äòup‚Äô and ‚Äòdown‚Äô states. The angular disposition of the NTD elements further indicated differences in
SARS and MERS with a particularly marked shift from the examined Œ≤-CoV spikes in the murine structure
(Figure 1E). Additional S1 differences are observed between vectors involving SD2. The disposition of the S2
domain relative to S1 defined by the dihedral about the vector connecting SD2 to the S2 CD differs markedly
between MERS/SARS-2 and SARS as well with the angle between the vectors connecting the NTD‚Äô to SD2
and SD2 to the CD demonstrating a shift in SARS-2. Finally, the disposition of the CD to the inner portion of S2
measured as an angle between a vector connected to an interior S2 Œ≤-sheet motif and the vector connecting

the CD to SD2 indicates SARS differs from both MERS and SARS-2. Interestingly, the MERS disposition
appears to respond to RBD triggering, displaying a bimodal distribution. These results demonstrate that, while
the individual domain architectures and overall arrangements are conserved (Figure 1D), important differences
between these domains exists between strains, suggesting that subtle differences in inter-domain contacts
could play a major role in determining these distributions and thereby alter surface antigenicity and the
propensity of the domains to access ‚Äòup‚Äô and ‚Äòdown‚Äô RBD states.

Identification of sites for differential stabilization of the SARS-2 ectodomain spike RBD orientation.
Based on the observed variability in the geometric analysis of Œ≤-CoV spikes, we asked whether the propensity
for the RBD to display the ‚Äòdown‚Äô and ‚Äòup‚Äô states could be modified via mutations without altering exposed
antigenic surfaces. To this end, we identified protomer to protomer interactive sites amenable to modification
and down selected mutations at these sites using the Schr√∂dinger Biologics suite38,39,40. In an effort to eliminate
exposure of the receptor binding site of the RBD, we examined the potential for disulfide linkages between the
RBD and its contact with S2 near the C-terminus of HR1 to prevent RBD exposure. We identified a double
cysteine mutant, S383C and D985C (RBD to S2 double mutant; rS2d; Supplemental Figure S1), as a candidate
for achieving this goal. The transition from the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state to the ‚Äòup‚Äô state involves shifts in the RBD to NTD
contacts. Therefore, in an effort to prevent these shifts, we identified a site in an RBD groove adjacent to the
NTD for which we prepared a triple mutant, D398L, S514L, and E516L (RBD to NTD triple mutant; rNt,
Supplemental Figure S1). As SD1 acts as a hinge point for the RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô/‚Äôdown‚Äô transitions (Figures 1A-C, 2I-J),
we hypothesized that enhanced hydrophobicity at the SD1 to S2 interface might shift the position of SD1, thus
influencing the hinge and potentially the propensity for RBD triggering. A double mutant, N866I and A570L
(Subdomain 1 to S2 double mutant; u1S2d, Supplemental Figure S1), as well as quadruple mutant, A570L,
T572I, F855Y, and N856I (Subdomain 1 to S2 quadruple mutant; u1S2q), were identified for this purpose. Finally,
we asked whether linking SD2 to S2 would alter the conformational distribution of the RBDs. The double cysteine
mutant, G669C and T866C (Subdomain 1 to S2 double mutant; u2S2d, Supplemental Figure S1), was identified
for this purpose. These mutants were prepared in the context of a previously published SARS-2 ectodomain
construct3.

NSEM analysis of the SARS-2 spike ectodomain proteins.
To assess the quality of the purified spike proteins and to obtain low resolution visualization of the structures,
we performed NSEM analysis. The micrographs showed a reasonably uniform distribution of particles consistent
with the size and shape of the SARS-2 spike ectodomain (Figure 3). 2D class averages showed spike
populations with well resolved domain features. The data were subjected to 3D-classification followed by
homogeneous refinement. The unmutated construct was resolved into two classes of roughly equal proportions.
The two classes differed in the position of their RBD domains. One class displayed all three RBDs in their ‚Äòdown‚Äô
positions, whereas, the other class displayed one RBD in the ‚Äòup‚Äô position. This was consistent with published
cryo-EM results15 that described a 1:1 ratio between the ‚Äòdown‚Äô and ‚Äò1-up‚Äô states of the SARS-2 spike
ectodomain. The mutant spikes were analyzed using a similar workflow as the unmutated spike. All of the
mutants displayed well-formed spikes in the micrographs, as well as in the 2D class averages. Following 3D
classification, for the rS2d construct, we observed only the ‚Äòdown‚Äô conformation; the 1-RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state that was
seen for the unmutated spike was not found in this dataset. The u1S2q mutant presented another striking finding,
where we observed a new conformational state with 2 RBDs in the ‚Äòup‚Äô position. The 2-RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state has been
reported before for the MERS CoV spike ectodomain12 but has not been observed thus far for either the SARS
or the SARS-2 spikes. Based on the NSEM analysis we selected the rS2d and u1S2q constructs for high
resolution analysis by cryo-EM.

Cryo-EM analysis of the SARS-2 spike ectodomain proteins.
To visualize the mutations and their effect on the structure of the spike, we collected cryo-EM datasets for the
rS2d and u1S2q constructs (Figure 4-7, Table 1, Supplemental Figures S2 and S3). Consistent with what was
observed in the NSEM analysis, after multiple rounds of 2D and 3D-classification to remove junk particles and
broken and/or misfolded spikes, we found a population of ‚Äòdown‚Äô state spike in the rS2d dataset through ab initio
classification in cryoSparc. We then implemented additional exhaustive ab initio classifications, as well as
heterogeneous classifications using low-pass filtered maps of known open conformations of CoV spikes to
search for open state spikes in the dataset. We were unable to find any such states, confirming that the SARS2 spike was locked in its ‚Äòdown‚Äô conformation in the rS2d mutant. The rS2d disulfide-linked density at the mutation
site confirmed disulfide formation in the double mutant (rS2d) (Figure 5). Comparison of the domain

arrangements of this construct with that of the unmutated ‚Äòdown‚Äô closed state structure indicated the protein
structure was otherwise unperturbed (Supplemental Figure S4A).
In contrast to the rS2d design, the u1S2q design displayed widespread rearrangement of the S1 domains
(Supplemental Figure S1B). In the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state structure, density in the mutated S2 position remained in the
configuration observed in the unmutated construct, with the N855I and F856Y residue loop in close proximity the
S2 residue L966 and S1 residue P589. This suggested these mutations had little impact on the observed shifts.
However, the S2-interactive SD1 displayed a rigid body movement relative to both the rS2d and unmutated
constructs with ùúΩ1 and …∏3 displacements of 3.4¬∞ and 1.8¬∞, respectively (Figure 5A and B). This resulted in
displacement of the A570L+T572I containing loop from the unmutated position which resides near the S2 L966
residue (Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure S1C). The S2 contact disruption is accompanied by an angular shift
of the NTD away from the primary trimer axis owing to SD1 to NTD‚Äô contacts, yielding ùúΩ3 and …∏3 shifts of 5.4¬∞
and 7.7¬∞, respectively (Figure 6C). The subdomain rearrangement impacts the positioning of the RBD with only
a minor shift in the …∏1 dihedral of 0.1¬∞ indicating the RBD moved with SD1 indicated in the ùúΩ1/…∏3 shifts. The newly
acquired arrangement in both the RBD and NTD was further accompanied by an apparent increase in their
flexibility suggesting conformational heterogeneity. These ‚Äòdown‚Äô state shifts were observed in both the single
RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô structure and the two RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô structures (Figure 6). Interestingly, the extent to which the SD1 shift
differed from that observed in the unmutated construct was context dependent in the 1 RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state. While the
‚Äòdown‚Äô state RBD in contact with the up state RBD displayed the large shift in position observed in the all ‚Äòdown‚Äô
state, the down state RBD with its terminal position free displayed an intermediate SD1 configuration. The up
state RBD in the u1S2q construct resided largely in the position occupied in the unmutated construct. This
indicated the effect of the mutations was primarily isolated to the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state and suggested these mutations
act to destabilize the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state rather than to stabilize the ‚Äòup‚Äô state. These features were largely recapitulated
in the u1S2q 2 RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state conformation with subdomain 1 retaining the shift in the down state RBD (Figure
7). The structural details presented here indicate that, while locking the ‚Äòdown‚Äô state RBD into its unmutated
position had little impact on the overall configuration of S1, altering the disposition of SD1 had wide ranging
impacts, consistent with the observed strain-to-strain differences in the geometric analysis described in Figures
1 and 2.

Discussion
Conformational plasticity is a hallmark of enveloped-virus fusion-protein structure, owing to the necessity of
protecting the conserved viral fusion elements from host immune responses while retaining a sufficiently steep
free-energy gradient to enable host cell fusion16. Exposed elements are generally well conditioned to be
permissive and responsive to mutations through genetic drift and host immune adaptation. Conformational
plasticity, however, presents an important difficulty in the context of vaccine and drug design. Indeed, lessons
learned in the continued effort to produce a broadly protective HIV-1 vaccine have demonstrated the importance
of a detailed understanding and control of fusion protein dynamics17-28. The novel SARS-CoV-2 is likely no
exception in this regard and indeed the conformational plasticity of the SARS-2 S-protein appeared greater than
that of the HIV-1 Env. We aimed to develop a quantitative understanding of Œ≤-CoV structural states between
strains and within each RBD ‚Äòdown‚Äô and ‚Äòup‚Äô state configuration. The wide breadth of domain arrangements along
with the relatively small contact area between the S1 and S2 subunits observed here suggested that, despite a
relatively low mutation rate, dramatic changes in S-protein structure may occur from few mutations. Indeed,
recent evidence for a mutation in the SD2 to S2 contact region suggests a potential fitness gain for acquisition
of such interfacial residues29. Based upon our results, this mutant, D614G, may indeed alter the conformational
landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.
From the perspective of immunogen development, the constructs developed here present an opportunity to
examine the ability of differentially stabilized S-protein particles to induce two different, yet important antibody
responses. First, the disulfide-linked ‚Äòdown‚Äô state locked double mutant (rS2d) would presumably eliminate
receptor binding site targeting antibodies which make up the majority of observed responses30,31. Indeed, a
study of MERS responses suggests non-RBD responses (particularly NTD and S2 epitopes) will play an
important role in vaccine induced protection32. From a theoretical perspective, the wide control over the RBD
‚Äòup‚Äô/‚Äòdown‚Äô distribution available to the virus suggests that, by analogy to known difficult to neutralize HIV-1
strains, conformational blocking of antibody responses would not be unusual. Although this may result in a
fitness cost to the virus, it would not necessarily make the virion non-infectious. Using the double mutant rS2d
as an immunogen provides a platform from which to induce such non-RBD responses that may be needed to
protect against such an evasion. The second area of interest concerns cryptic pocket targeting antibodies
which have proven effective in the neutralization of SARS. These antibodies target an epitope presented only

in the ‚Äòup‚Äô state RBDs and appear to require a two RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô configuration33. The current stabilized ectodomain
construct in wide use in SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials was demonstrated previously, and recapitulated here by
NSEM, to display only the ‚Äòdown‚Äô and one RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô states. However, the u1S2q, SD1/S2 targeting design
developed here display a prominent two RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state distribution compatible with these cryptic-epitope
targeting MAbs. This suggests it is capable of inducing such antibodies. While complicating factors, such as a
potential for vaccine enhancement, may favor the use of truncated, single domain constructs which may
display fewer potentially weakly or non-neutralizing epitopes, these, along with the designs presented here will
allow for a detailed characterization of not only vaccine immunogenicity but also antigenicity, paving the way
for next generation vaccines for the novel SARS-CoV-2 and the eventual development of a broadly neutralizing
Œ≤-CoV vaccine. Thus, while the previous generation of stabilizing mutations ensure well folded trimer, the
rational design approach developed here provides a means by which precisely controlling the RBD orientation
distribution, thus allowing exploratory efforts to understand the role of conformational dynamics from the
perspective of vaccine and drug development.

Methods
Vector based analysis
Vector analysis was performed using available cryo-EM structures for SARS-213,14, SARS4,5,7,8, MERS4,12, and
other human2,10 and murine11 Œ≤-CoV spike proteins. Domains for the vector analysis were selected based upon
visual inspection of alignments between SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 structures. Specifically, CŒ± centroids
for the S1 NTD, RBD, SD1, SD2 (SARS-CoV-2 residues, 27-43 and 54-271, 330-443 and 503-528, 323-329
and 529-590, 294-322 and 591-696, respectively; equivalent SARS/MERS/Murine/HKU1/OC43 residues
selected based upon structural alignment with SARS-CoV-2) as well as a Œ≤-sheet motif in the NTD (residues
116 -129 and 169-172) and a helix motif in the RBD (residues 403-410) were determined. The NTD was split
into two regions with the SD1 contacting, SD2 adjacent portion referred to here as the NTD‚Äô (residues 44-53
and 272-293). CŒ± centroids in the S2 domain were obtained for a Œ≤-sheet motif (residues 717-727 and 10471071) and the CD domain (711-716 and 1072-1122). Vector magnitudes, angles, and dihedrals between these

centroids were determined and used in the subsequent analysis. Vector analysis was performed using the
VMD34 Tcl interface. Principal component analysis performed in R with the vector data centered and scaled35.

Rational, structure-based design
Structures for SARS (PDB ID 5X584), MERS (PDB ID 6Q0436), and SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 6VXX15) were
prepared in Maestro37 using the protein preparation wizard38 followed by in silico mutagenesis using
Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cysteine mutation39 and residue scanning40 tools. Residue scanning was first performed for
individual selected sites allowing mutations to Leu, Ile, Trp, Tyr, and Val followed by scanning of combinations
for those which yielded a negative overall score. Scores and visual inspection were used in the selection of the
prepared constructs.

Protein expression and purification
The SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain constructs were produced and purified as described previously (refWrapp et al., McLellan). Briefly, a gene encoding residues 1‚àí1208 of the SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank:
MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a ‚ÄúGSAS‚Äù substitution at the furin cleavage site
(residues 682‚Äì685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a
TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pŒ±H. All
mutants were introduced in this background. Expression plasmids encoding the ectodomain sequence were
used to transiently transfect FreeStyle293F cells using Turbo293 (SpeedBiosystems). Protein was purified on
the sixth day post-transfection from the filtered supernatant using StrepTactin resin (IBA).

Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
Purified SARS-CoV-2 spike preparations were diluted to a concentration of ~1 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200
mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. 2.5 ¬µL of protein was deposited on a CF-1.2/1.3 grid that had been glow
discharged for 30 seconds in a PELCO easiGlow‚Ñ¢ Glow Discharge Cleaning System. After a 30 s incubation
in >95% humidity, excess protein was blotted away for 2.5 seconds before being plunge frozen into liquid
ethane using a Leica EM GP2 plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems). Frozen grids were imaged in a Titan Krios
(Thermo Fisher) equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan). Data were acquired using the Leginon system41. The

dose was fractionated over 50 raw frames and collected at 50ms framerate. This dataset was energy-filtered
with a slit width of 30 eV. Individual frames were aligned and dose-weighted. CTF estimation, particle picking,
2D classifications, ab initio model generation, heterogeneous refinements, and homogeneous 3D refinements
were carried out in cryoSPARC42.

Cryo-EM structure fitting
Structures of the all ‚Äòdown‚Äô state (PDB ID 6VXX) and single RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state (PDB ID 6VYB) from the previously
published SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain were used to fit the cryo-EM maps in Chimera43. The 2 RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state was
generated in PyMol using the single RBD ‚Äòup‚Äô state structure. Mutations were made in PyMol44. Coordinates
were then fit manually in Coot45 followed by iterative refinement using Phenix46 real space refinement and
subsequent manual coordinate fitting in Coot. Structure and map analysis were performed using PyMol and
Chimera.
