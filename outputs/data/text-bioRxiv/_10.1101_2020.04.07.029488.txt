SUMMARY
The global pandemic of COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus, has produced an urgent requirement and search for improved treatments whilst
effective vaccines are developed. A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels
of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential
damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage
to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive
glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most
susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2
proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional
domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues,
suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine
residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are
activated towards modification by MG – residues with predicted or expected low pKa by
neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the
spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related
coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular
MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity,
doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of
SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin
and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate
therapeutic index may be established.

INTRODUCTION
A global pandemic of COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus has developed from January 2020. It has produced a global public health
emergency with currently (20th July 2020) over 14 million infections and ca. 600,000 deaths,
with both rapidly increasing. New treatments are urgently required for COVID-19 disease
until effective vaccines are developed. A rapid route to achieve this is repurposing of existing
drugs with previously undisclosed activity against coronavirus infection.
As a strategy to identify drugs for repurposing, we sought to explore whether the
SARS-CoV-2 may have vulnerabilities in the viral proteome to modification by endogenous
reactive metabolites. Pharmacological increase of reactive metabolites will then produce a
virucidal effect and therapeutic response for COVID-19 disease. Important reactive
metabolites producing major quantitative modification of the proteome in physiological
systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and methylglyoxal (MG) (Winterbourn,
2008;Rabbani and Thornalley, 2015). Key to characterizing the vulnerability of the viral
proteome to reactive metabolites, ROS and MG, is location of their susceptible amino acid
residue targets in functional domains of viral proteins and activation of these residues
towards reaction with reactive metabolites. ROS are formed by mitochondria through trace
leakage of electron flux in oxidative phosphorylation, by oxidases and other sources. They
are metabolized by antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione
peroxidase and peroxiredoxins (Murphy et al., 2011). The reactive dicarbonyl metabolite,
MG, is formed mainly by trace level degradation of triosephosphate glycolytic intermediates,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate, and is mainly metabolised by
glutathione-dependent glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) of the glyoxalase pathway (Rabbani et al., 2016b)
(Figure 1A). The most susceptible targets in proteins to modification by ROS are cysteine
residues which are oxidised to cystine and cysteine sulfenic and sulfonic acids (Winterbourn,

2008). The most susceptible targets in proteins to modification by MG are arginine residues
which are glycated to hydroimidazolone MG-H1 with loss of charge, all related electrostatic
interactions and, typically, resistance to proteolytic cleavage close to the site of modification
(Rabbani et al., 2016b) (Figure 1B).
Key to exploring if reactive metabolites of the host can be exploited to produce a
virucidal response against SARS-CoV-2 is to identify proteomic vulnerabilities of the virus.
Currently it is unknown if target amino acid residues of reactive metabolites are enriched in
functional domains of the viral proteome, and if these targets amino acids are activated
towards modification by reactive metabolites. It also unknown if there are investigational
new drugs or current clinically approved drugs that increase reactive metabolites to virucidal
levels in the cellular environment where SARS-CoV-2 undergo cell fusion and propagation.
To address these gaps in knowledge, we initiated a series of studies using bioformatics tools,
available proteomics data and a cell model used in SARS-CoV-2 virus propagation. Herein
we report the susceptibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to increased MG or “dicarbonyl stress”
(Rabbani and Thornalley, 2015). This is based on enrichment of arginine residues in
functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and predicted activation of many of these
arginine residues to modification by MG through neighbouring group interactions. We also
identified two clinical antitumor drugs that increase the cellular concentration of MG to
virucidal levels and are candidates for consideration for repurposing for evaluation for
treatment of COVI-19.

Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel, monoclonal anti-Glo1 antibody (rat), anti-Rat IgG (whole
molecule)–Biotin conjugate, D-Lactic dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Poole, Dorset, UK). Geneticin G-418 (potency rating – 700 µg) was purchased from Fisher
Scientific (Loughborough, UK). S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopenyl diester (BBGD)
was prepared an purifeid in-house, as described (Thornalley et al., 1996). The HEK293 cell
line was purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Virginia, USA).
Plasmids, pIRES2-GLO1-EGFP and pIRES-EGFP, PJT laboratory were prepared and
purified in-house, as described (Ahmed et al., 2008).

Sequences of SARS CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERs and human host proteins.
Reference sequences of the 29 proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Table S1) and
sequences of analogous proteins of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) coronaviridae were obtained from the NBCI reference sequence database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Sequences of reviewed proteins of the human proteome, 18,821 –
excluding fetal proteins, were obtained from the UniProtKB database (www.uniprot.org).

Receptor binding domain analysis
Receptor binding domain (RBD) analysis is a protein primary sequenced based informatics
method to deduce amino acid residues in functional domains of proteins – defined as sites of
protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid and protein-ligand or substrate interaction. It is
applicable to any protein. The optimised protocol uses a window of 5 amino acid residues
moved sequentially along the sequence of a protein, assuming a gyration angle between two
consecutive residues in the sequence of 100°, to deduce sequential mean Eisenberg
hydrophobicity and mean dipole moment for the central amino acid. Values cannot be
deduced for the two amino acids at the N- and C-termini of proteins and they are therefore

missing from the amino acid residue prevalence reports (Gallet et al., 2000). This approach
had 80% accuracy when validated against a database of known interacting proteins (Gallet et
al., 2000). We developed an R script to obtain mean hydrophobicity and hydrophobic
moment for all UniProtKB proteins and SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

Prediction of arginine residues activated for methylglyoxal modification
Arginine residues of proteins are activated towards reaction with MG by decrease of pKa of
the guanidino side chain which facilitates formation of the MG-guanidino sidechain
encounter (Rabbani and Thornalley, 2012;Rabbani et al., 2016a). Arginine residue sidechain
pKa is decreased by interaction with neighbouring amino acid residues with positively
charged sidechains. For an α-helix, interactions with lysine or arginine residues at positions 4, -3, +3 and +4 in the sequence with respect to the target arginine residue are expected to
decrease the arginine target residue pKa by side chain interaction along the side of the helix
axis. Longer range interactions occur between these and other types of secondary structure
domains in the tertiary structures of proteins where arginine residue pKa may be predicted
from crystallographic data. We explored the peptide environments of arginine residues in
predicted functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, identifying arginine residues
with neighbouring interacting lysine and arginine residues, predicted secondary structure and
predicted arginine residues target pKa where crystallographic data are available. Information
om predicted secondary structure was extracted from in silico predicted models: nsp1,
YxJyvF; nsp3, 5hYU6g; M-protein, 9LzAZz (http://3dbionotes.cnb.csic.es/ws/covid19)
(Waterhouse et al., 2018). Arginine side chain predicted pKa values are given, deduced by
DelPhiPKa program (Wang et al., 2016) using nucleoprotein crystal structure (pdb file
6VYO; Chang et al., to be published) and AMBER forcefield (predictions were similar with

CHARMM and PARSE forcefields). To identify similar arginines residues in SARS-CoV and
MERS proteins, we used the Clustal Omega software on-line (Madeira et al., 2019).

Culture of HEK293 cells in vitro.
The HEK293 cell line, seeding density 2 x 104 cells cm-2, was cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) containing phenol red, L-glutamine and 4500 mg/L
glucose, supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 U penicillin and 0.1
mg/ml streptomycin. pIRES2-GLO1-EGFP plasmid (Glo1+ vector) and pIRES-EGFP
plasmid (empty vector) were prepared as described (Ahmed et al., 2008). HEK293 cells were
stably transfected with Glo1+ and empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (plasmid DNA: Lipofectamine 2000, 1:4). After 48 h, cells were
sub-cultured, G-418 disulphate was added (2 mg/ml; 405 µg/mg potency) culture continued.
Transfected colonies with GFP fluorescence were selected using a cloning disc (3.2 mm) and
glass cylinder selector (8 mm, 150 µl) and cultured further with G-418 disulphate (1 mg/ml,
705 µg/mg potency) containing medium. Assessment of Glo1 activity and protein, as
described (Arai et al., 2014;Xue et al., 2014), indicated a 4 - 5 fold increase in Glo1 activity
and protein. HEK293 cells stably tranfected with empty and GLO1+ vectors were incubated
with and without cell permeable Glo1 inhibitor, S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopenyl
diester (BBGD) (Thornalley et al., 1996), doxorubucin and paclitaxel at the concentrations
indicated (diluted from 100 mM stock solution in DMSO) for 2 days and effect on cell
growth assessed by viable cell number counts, using the Trypan blue exclusion method and
median growth inhibitory concentrations GC50 deduced. Cellular MG concentration and flux
of formation of D-lactate, a surrogate measure of flux of formation of MG, was assayed as
described (Rabbani and Thornalley, 2014;Irshad et al., 2019).

Statistical analysis
Datasets were checked for normality of distribution and parametric statistical tests for
assessment of significance of difference between study groups applied: Student’s t-test for
two groups and one-way ANOVA for 3 or more study groups.

RESULTS

Enrichment of arginine residues in the functional domains in the SARS-CoV-2
proteome.
We acquired primary amino acid sequences of the 29 proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome
(Table S1) and also, for comparison, 18,821 reviewed protein sequences of human host
proteins from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB; www.uniprot.org). We found a
similar prevalence of cysteine and arginine residues in the viral proteome: 3.14% and 3.63%,
respectively (Table 1). We applied RBD analysis to identify functional domains of viral
proteins and to thereby deduce the prevalence and enrichment of cysteine and arginine
residues therein. The RBD analysis outcome is illustrated as a plot of mean hydrophobicity
against mean dipole moment for the widow of 5 amino acid residues moved sequentially
along the sequence of a protein. An example of the RBD analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein is given in Figure 1C. Functional domains are located in a trapezium-shaped domain
on the top-left side of the plot – regions of low mean hydrophobicity and high mean dipole
moment of proximate groups of amino acid residues. This analysis showed that 4.8% of
cysteine residues were in functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome whereas a much
greater proportion of arginine residues, 30.7%, were in functional domains. The enrichment
of arginine residues in functional domains was 4.9-fold – the highest of any amino acid,
whereas there was a slight negative enrichment, 0.8-fold, or depletion of cysteine residues in

functional domains. Other amino acid residues susceptible to oxidative damage were also
depleted in functional domains: met 0.6, tyr 0.8 and trp 0.3 (Table 1). The SARS-CoV-2
proteome is, therefore, resistant to oxidative inactivation but susceptible to functional
inactivation by MG. For individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the majority had arginine residue
enrichment in the functional domains greater than the mean of the human host proteome of
ca. 3.5: range 2.3 – 13.5 (Figure 1D).

Arginine residues activated for methylglyoxal modification by predicted neighboring
group interaction
We next sought to identify of arginine residues in the predicted functional domains of SARSCoV-2 proteins are activated towards modification by MG based on potentially neighbouring
group side-chain interaction with arginine and lysine residues and, where crystallographic
data are available, predicted target arginine residue pKa. For example, in human serum
albumin, neighbouring group interactions with R186, R218 and R410 decrease the pKa values
of their sidechain guanidino groups to 12.5, 12.2 and 12.5 from the basal pKa of 13.8 (Fitch et
al., 2015). The reactivity with MG of these arginine residues increases by 20 – 40 fold
through increase of the trace level conjugate base of the sidechain guanidino group (Fitch et
al., 2015;Rabbani et al., 2016a). In low-level extent of modification of albumin by MG in
experimental investigations in vitro and similar low-level extent of modification by MG of
human serum albumin found similarly in vivo, MG was detected on these residues
preferentially (Ahmed et al., 2005).
Applying RBD analysis and inspecting sequences for arginine or lysine residues at
positions -4, -3, +3 and +4 with respect to the target arginine, we found the following number
of arginine residues reactive towards MG modification and protein inactivation in predicted
functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 proteins: nsp1, 2; nsp2, 3; nsp3, 3; nsp8, 1; nsp12, 1;

nsp15, 2; spike protein, 2; M-protein, 1; NC, 10; and ORF10, 1. There were 25 functional
arginines potentially activated for MG modification: 5 sites were in predicted α-helices and 2
in NC with predicted pKa lowered by neighboring group interaction and thereby activated
towards MG-modification (Table 2).
Uniquely for related coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has an interacting
arginine triad, R682RAR685, at the S1/S2 cleavage site (Andersen et al., 2020) with both R682
and R685 predicted sites susceptible to MG modification (Figure 2A). Modification of this
triad by MG is expected to confer resistance to proteolytic cleavage by transmembrane serine
proteases (TMPRSSs) and blocking cell fusion for virion entry into pulmonary alveolar
epithelial and other cell target sites, uncoating and replication (Meng et al., 2020). Trapped in
the extracellular environment, there is excepted to be an improved host immune response to
the virus; cf. viral host immunity boosted by similar aldehyde-modifying agents (HerreraRodriguez et al., 2019).
SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein is highly susceptible to modification and functional
inactivation by MG. Nucleoprotein binds the 3’ end of the viral single strand RNA genome of
SARS-CoV-2 and it is arginine-rich, as is typical of RNA-binding proteins (Tan and Frankel,
1995). By analogy with SARS-CoV, residues 42-187 are involved with RNA binding with
R93 playing a critical role (McBride et al., 2014). It is predicted to have sites susceptible to
MG modification. The crystal structure of a segment of nucleoprotein, residues 50 – 173, is
available and this enabled prediction of pKa values of arginine residues in this region. pKa
shifts from 13.8 of inactivated arginine (Fitch et al., 2015) for R93 and R95 indicated ca. 16
and 40-fold increased reactivity towards MG modification, compared to non-activated target
residue. These residues lie in a pentad of reactive arginine residues where MG modification
at R93 and R95 is expected to inactive the nucleoprotein (Figure 2B). The SR-rich region of
182 – 196 is important for virus replication (Tylor et al., 2009) and is also a target for MG

modification and inactivation at 3 sites: R185, R 191 and R195. MG modification of the
nucleoprotein, and also membrane protein, will block viral replication and virion assembly,
respectively.
There are similar MG modification sites in functional domains of related
coronaviridae. The proteome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
had 23 similar MG modification sites to those of SARS-CoV-2, and MERS coronavirus
proteome had 12 similar MG modification sites. In all of these coronaviridae there were
multiple MG modification sites in functional domains of the nucleoprotein (Table 2). Given
the high activation of multiple arginine residues in functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2
proteome, it is likely that pharmacological increase of endogenous MG concentration will
produce modification at multiple susceptible and functional sites, producing protein
inactivation and antiviral response.

Pharmacological increase of cellular methylglyoxal to virucidal levels by cell permeable
glyoxalase 1 inhibitor and clinical antitumor drugs, doxorubicin and paclitaxel
Antiviral activity of supraphysiological concentrations of MG was reported historically (De
Bock et al., 1957). More recently, inhibition of cytopathic effect of strains of influenza B by
MG was investigated. The most sensitive strain gave a median inhibitory concentration of 23
± 7 µM MG (Charyasriwong et al., 2016). These studies assessed antiviral activity by effect
assessed by cytopathic response – concentration of MG required to prevent 50% lysis of
infected cells, using relatively high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Median effective
concentrations for antiviral effects of pharmacological agents tend to be lower in
physiologically relevant range of MOI than in pathogenic response assessment (Wang et al.,
2020b). These studies also used exogenous MG in cellular in vitro models where MG is
rapidly metabolized by Glo1 and onward through the glyoxalase pathway to D-lactate

(Rabbani et al., 2016b). The cellular concentration of MG is 1 – 4 µM and the plasma
concentration 130 – 250 nM (Rabbani and Thornalley, 2014;Xue et al., 2016;Irshad et al.,
2019). The optimum approach to achieve an antiviral effect is to increase cellular MG
concentration by inhibition of Glo1. BBGD is a potent cell permeable Glo1 inhibitor prodrug.
It delivers the Glo1 competitive inhibitor, S-p-bromobenzylglutathione (Ki = 160 nM), into
cells and has established antitumor and antimalarial activity (Thornalley et al.,
1994;Thornalley et al., 1996) (Figure 3A). We studied the effect of BBDG and clinically
approved antitumor drugs on the cellular concentration of MG in human HEK293 cells – a
cellular model employed for SARS-CoV-2 propagation (Chien et al., 2016). BBGD
increased the endogenous concentration of cellular MG by 4-fold to ca. 20 µM – a level
similar to that which inhibited viral cytopathic activity (Charyasriwong et al., 2016).
We have a longstanding interest in anticancer activity of Glo1 inhibitors and
overexpression of Glo1 in multidrug resistant tumors (Thornalley et al., 1996;Rabbani et al.,
2018). Hence, we have been studying the likely involvement of increased MG in the
mechanism of action of clinical antitumor drugs. Interestingly, we found clinical antitumor
agents, doxorubicin and paclitaxel (Figure 3A), also increased cellular MG by a similar
extent (Figure 3B). Increased MG concentration induced by doxorubicin and paclitaxel is
linked to increased glucose metabolism and related increased formation of MG as a
byproduct of glycolysis. Indeed, flux of formation of D-lactate - a surrogate indicator of flux
of formation of MG - was increased by both drugs (Figure 3C).
Increase of cellular MG also likely contributes to the antiproliferative effect of BBGD
(Rabbani et al., 2018). The involvement of MG in the antiproliferative activity of doxorubicin
and paclitaxel is unknown. We explored this by determining the effect of overexpression of
Glo1 on inhibition of HEK293 cell growth. Vector-derived stable transfectant HEK293 cells
lines were prepared with Glo1 expression increased 4 – 5 fold and empty vector transfectant

control (Figure 3D and 3E), imposing a 4 – 5 fold increased rate of MG metabolism in Glo1
overexpressing cells. When these transfectant cell lines were treated with growth inhibitory
concentrations of drugs, there was an increase of median growth inhibitory concentration
GC50 value and resistance to inhibition of cell growth in HEK293 cells with stable
overexpression of Glo1 (Figure 3F and 3H). The GC50 values were (mean ± SD; empty
vector vs Glo1+): doxorubicin, 3.54 ± 0.28 nM vs 55.9 ± 3.4 nM (16-fold resistance);
paclitaxel – 6.8 ± 1.0 nM vs 56.4 ± 7.2 nM (8-fold resistance). For treatment with BBGD
there was an antiproliferative effect with limited change in GC50 value with Glo1
overexpression: 4.78 ± 0.18 µM vs 7.37 ± 0.30 µM (2-fold resistance). The limited effect on
antiproliferative effect of BBGD is expected as the delivered Glo1 inhibitor also inhibits the
overexpression factor, Glo1.

DISCUSSION
The enrichment of arginine residues in functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome
provides important evidence to support an arginine-modifying agent strategy for inactivation
of the virus and virucidal activity. Arginine residues are also enriched in the human host
proteome but less so that in SARS-CoV-2; 3.6 versus 4.9. This characteristic of the human
proteome was noted previously (Gallet et al., 2000) – now updated herein with UniProtKB
current sequence information. In addition, in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome there is a high
number of arginine residues activated by neighbouring groups for reaction with MG. This
particularly applies to the nucleoprotein and, uniquely for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, to
the furin cleavage site of the spike protein. For the 25 arginine residues identified with
predicted reactivity towards MG modification in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, there is
supporting secondary structure and predicted low pKa value evidence for 7 of them. These
arginine residue targets are in key proteins: nucleoprotein, M-protein and Spike protein. A

further important feature for susceptibility of viral proteins to MG modification is protein
abundance: high abundance of a protein increases its susceptibility to reaction with MG.
Previous earlier studies of the SARS virion suggested proteins of highest abundance were:
nucleoprotein, M-protein, Spike protein and nsp3 (Neuman et al., 2008). Assuming a similar
relative abundance of proteins in SARS-CoV-2, multiple arginine residues reactive towards
modification and inactivation by MG were found in the 4 most abundant proteins of the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome.
We also explored use of proteomics data from previous studies where MG
modification was detected at 411 in different sites in the cytosolic extract of human
endothelial cells in culture (Irshad et al., 2019) in an attempt to identify a proteomic MG
modification motif to map onto the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (data not shown). Although we
could determine amino acid frequencies round the MG-modified arginine targets, there was a
dropout of peptides (failure to detect) without lysine and arginine residues on the N-terminal
side of the arginine target in mass spectrometric detection. In comparisons with unmodified
arginine target peptide sequences, this led to an artifactual enrichment of lysine and arginine
residues on the N-terminal side of the MG-modified arginine target. This peptide dropout was
likely due to an additional missed cleavage by trypsin when the target arginines were
modified by MG, making the related tryptic peptides difficult to detect in mass spectrometry
analysis due to the loss of arginine residue charge and increased sequence length. This
requires further investigation and likely studies with other proteases other than trypsin in
which MG modification changes tryptic peptide formation.
SARS-CoV-2 was rich with arginine residues in functional sites activated to MG
modification. Other coronaviridae - SARS-CoV-2 and MERS - had similar MG modification

pharmacological agents increasing cellular concentration of MG, inducing dicarbonyl stress,
may have virucidal activity against multiple coronaviridae.
Doxorubicin and paclitaxel are clinical antiproliferative antitumor agents with
mechanisms of action targeting inhibition of topoisomerase-II in DNA replication and
stabilization of the interphase and microtubular network and mitotic spindle in mitosis,
respectively (Schiff et al., 1979;Tewey et al., 1984). Herein, we show that increase in MG
contributes to their mechanism of antiproliferative activity. Doxorubicin increases glucose
metabolism by increasing expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 and hexokinase-2
(Demel et al., 2015). Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules, decreasing free tubulin concentration;
the latter increasing mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) activity and
thereby in situ activity of hexokinase (Maldonado et al., 2010). These mechanisms are
available in the lung epithelial cells primarily targeted by SARS-Cov-2 (Pezzulo et al.,
2011;Lottes et al., 2014). Increased glucose metabolism produces a corresponding increase in
the formation of MG – evidenced herein by increase in flux of formation of D-lactate; there
may be disproportionately large increase in MG if expression of enzymes of onward
metabolism of triosephosphates, triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, are not increased along with hexokinase activity and glycolysis becomes
dysregulated or unscheduled (Irshad et al., 2019;Rabbani and Thornalley, 2019).
In the search for drugs to repurpose for COVID-19 disease, we suggest doxorubicin
and paclitaxel be considered. These drugs have not been proposed hitherto although they
have been evaluated for antiviral activity, particularly with respect to inhibition of viral
helicase (Ash and Diekema, 1987;Bergamini et al., 1992;Borowski et al., 2002;Briguglio et
al., 2011). Paclitaxel also suppressed inflammation in a murine model of bacterial
pneumonia (Mirzapoiazova et al., 2007). However, a concern is the established adverse
effects of these drugs found in cancer chemotherapy: bone marrow suppression (primarily

neutropenia) and peripheral neuropathy for paclitaxel, and cumulative congestive heart
failure for doxorubicin. Toxicity is related to dose and duration of treatment (Rowinsky,
1997;Barrett-Lee et al., 2009). Drug treatment of COVID-19 may be shorter than in cancer
chemotherapy: for example, median hospitalization time of patients surviving severe
symptoms of COVID-19 was 28 days (Wang et al., 2020a) and a typical course of cancer
chemotherapy with paclitaxel and doxorubicin is 6 months or longer (Rowinsky,
1997;Barrett-Lee et al., 2009). If high potency antiviral effect of these agents is found, low
dose and short duration of treatment is expected to decrease risk of adverse effects.
The approach to drug repurposing for COVID-19 developed herein addresses the
intrinsic vulnerability of SARS CoV-2 proteome to endogenous reactive metabolites, with
respect to the human host, and identified drugs to exploit this. Other strategies for
repurposing drugs are based on SARS CoV-2 protein interactions with human host proteins
and drugs targeted to them, virion endosomal processing and viral protease inhibition (Chen
et al., 2020;Gordon et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020b).

CONCLUSIONS
We provide evidence of vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to modification and inactivation by
MG. We also reveal, for the first time, increase in cellular concentration of MG in the
antiproliferative activity of doxorubicin and paclitaxel – thereby providing a mechanistic
rationale for repurposing of these drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19
disease. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel may have potential for application for treatment of
COVID-19 and may now be considered for evaluation in SARS-CoV-2 live virus cultures
and animal models.
