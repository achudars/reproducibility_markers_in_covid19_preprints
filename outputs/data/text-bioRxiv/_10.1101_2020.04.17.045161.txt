Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has exploded
throughout the global human population. This pandemic coronavirus strain has taken
scientists and public health researchers by surprise and knowledge of its basic biology
(e.g. structure/function relationships in its genomic, messenger and template RNAs) and
modes for therapeutic intervention lag behind that of other human pathogens. In this
report we used a recently-developed bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the
RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We recapitulate known
elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift
signal. Our results find that the SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and
likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a huge reservoir of potential
drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Our results also predict regions that are
accessible for intermolecular interactions, which can aid in the design of antisense
therapeutics. All results are made available via a public database (the
RNAStructuromeDB) where they may hopefully drive drug discovery efforts to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
INTRODUCTION
There are four subfamilies within Coronaviridae – Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,
Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. SARS-CoV 2 (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2) falls under Betacoronavirus, with the subgenus Sarbecovirus1.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a roughly 30kb, positive sense (i.e. translation
competent), 5 capped single-stranded RNA molecule. The first two-thirds of
Coronavirus genomes contain the ORF1ab gene, which consists of 16 non-structural
proteins (NSP). ORF1ab consists of two large polyproteins (ORF1a and ORF1b) that
are processed into smaller subunits. Translation begins in ORF1a, and following an
RNA structural frameshift element (FSE) translation resumes into the -1 frame of
ORF1b; each are then processed into smaller units via proteases2. The latter third
consists of the main viral structural elements (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M),
and nucleocapsid (N)) as well as at least 13 known downstream ORFs. Upon infection
of the host cell, viral RNA is translated into a series of NSP that replicate viral genomic
(g)RNA and subgenomic (sg)RNA2. The replication-transcription complex (RTC) is
capable of either continuous (genomic) or discontinuous (subgenomic) transcription into
negative templates. Due to the method of template generation observed in SARS-like
coronaviruses, negative sense templates share the same 5 and 3 end, differing in
length based on their transcription regulatory sequences (TRS)2. TRS core sequences
(AGCAAC or CUAAAC) have been previously observed to be highly conserved3 and
facilitate addition of the nascent transcript to the 5 leader TRS via complementary base
pairing interactions between RNA structural elements. Both the 5 leader and 3 end
sequences contain conserved RNA structural elements which are thought to serve
function at both the genomic and subgenomic level. Viruses utilizing similar replication
and expression strategies are known to contain a variety of RNA structural elements to
direct these processes, however in the novel SARS-CoV-2 genome (and many other

coronaviruses), the extent of functional RNA structural elements is still under
investigation.
The recent global pandemic has put significant pressure on the academic community to
provide structure and mechanism to the many unknowns associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Particular focus is on the development of novel therapeutic agents to target and inhibit
processes critical to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. To help address this
important need, we have analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 genome using an RNA structural
analysis and motif discovery pipeline, ScanFold, which has been previously applied to
two other RNA viruses: Zika and HIV-14; as well as human mRNAs for MYC5 and synuclein6. A significant innovation of ScanFold is that unique consensus secondary
structural motifs are generated from bases pairs with the strongest evidence of being
functional, while not necessarily focusing on evolutionary conservation (as in a recent
analysis of SARS-CoV-27). This provides a means of deducing novel structural
elements that may only occur in this most recent pathogenic strain and, additionally,
gives a global view of local structure that may not be forming specific structures – but
still makes use of molecular stability. In addition to improving our basic understanding of
RNA secondary structure, these results provided leads for the rational design of smallmolecule drugs against SARS-CoV-2 RNAs8.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
SARS-CoV-2 ScanFold Analysis
Computational characterizations of RNA molecules of this size require special routines
(typically a scanning analysis window) to perform the most accurate thermodynamic and
statistical predictions of RNA folding. The program ScanFold was designed for this
purpose and, in this study, has been applied to the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2
(NC_045512.2); it has previously been used to characterize other positive-strand viral
genomes including HIV-1 and Zika virus (ZIKV)4. The ScanFold method attempts to
highlight regions most likely to have functional structure and generates unique 2D
models for highly-structured and likely functional motifs2. This method is not only
valuable for functional RNA structured motif discovery and mapping the general RNA
folding landscape9, but for identifying structures likely to be available for targeting via
small molecules as well8,10. The full output of these results can be seen in
Supplementary Dataset 1 and are available for browsing at
https://www.structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2.

ScanFold-Scan Analysis
Using ScanFold-Scan (performs initial scanning window analysis1), a variety of RNA
folding metrics were calculated across the genome, which are described in detail in
Methods section. Using a step size of 1 nt and a window size of 120 nt resulted in the
generation of 29,783 analysis windows. The parameters used were previously found to
perform optimally at detecting known structures in viral genomes that were consistent

with experimental biochemical structure probing data2. The full SARS-CoV-2 scan
results can be accessed at structurome.bb.iastate.edu/jbrowse where raw metrics are
mapped directly alongside the genome sequence (and can be viewed in table format as
well in Table S1).
Two of the most revealing metrics are shown in Figure 1a: the minimum free energy
(MFE) G°, which reports the predicted change in the Gibb’s free energy for the most
stable predicted RNA 2D structure and the G° z-score, which measures the number of
standard deviations more thermodynamically stable this MFE is vs. random sequences
of the same nucleotide composition (Eq. 1; Methods). In this way, the G° z-score
attempts to characterize the propensity of a sequence to be ordered to adopt a
particular fold, implying potentially functional roles for the structure (where negative zscores are ordered to be more stable than expected for their composition). The MFE
values across the genome ranged from -8.8 to -47.5 and averaged -26.1 kcal/mol
(where MFE values mostly corresponded to changes in nucleotide content; Table S1).
The G° z-scores across the genome ranged from -6.4 to +2.74 and strikingly, yielded
an average G° z-score of -1.50. For comparison, this value is one standard deviation
more stable on average than the previously scanned human pathogen positive strand
RNA genomes of HIV-1 and ZIKV which had average G° z-scores of -0.45 and -0.55
respectively. In each case, the z-scores are normally distributed around a negative
median value (Fig. 1b) however, SARS-CoV-2 is sufficiently shifted into the negative
(i.e. a median G° z-score <-1) to be classified as having globally ordered RNA
structure11-13. Local regions of highly negative z-scores and MFE values are found
throughout the entirety of the genome and do not immediately appear concentrated in
any given genomic region. However, two known RNA structural motifs annotated for
human coronaviruses in Rfam14,15 overlapped regions predicted with negative z-scores:
SL1-2 and the FSE (Fig. 1c and 1d).

Positive G° z-score regions can be seen throughout the genome as well, but are less
frequent and smaller in size. Previous analyses found that such regions were more
likely to be reactive to structure probing molecules2 (i.e. suggesting they are
unstructured or highly dynamic)—potentially to facilitate intermolecular or long-range
intra-genomic interactions. Of the 118 windows overlapping the start codon of ORF1a,
70 windows (i.e. 60%) had positive G° z-scores (Fig. 2a) suggesting a preference for
weak structures localizing around the start codon; consistent with previous analyses of
RNA folding near start codons5,16. Another notable positive G° z-score region is the
3 UTR, which was found to yield mostly positive z-scores; despite a higher than average
GC content for this region (0.45 on average; Table S1), MFE values here were less
stable than expected, averaging G° z-scores of +0.98 (or roughly one standard
deviation less stable than random). Scans were also performed in the negative sense of
the genome, revealing slightly less propensity for structure. The MFE values ranged
from -42.9 to -6.0 and averaged -23.25 kcal/mol; z-scores in the negative sense had a
similar range of G° z-scores as the positive sense (-5.76 to 2.66) but averaged lower
at -1.12 (Table S1). Interestingly, G° z-scores for the 3 UTR in negative sense were
more skewed to the negative (finding minimums as low as -2.32) resulting in an average
z-score of 0.16 for the region.

ScanFold-Fold Analysis
To predict the RNA secondary structures responsible for negative G° z-score metrics,
ScanFold-Fold was used to generate local RNA structural models based on the
genome-wide ScanFold-Scan results. Here, each base pair observed throughout the
scan is recorded along with corresponding metrics. Throughout the scan, each
nucleotide was typically found to pair with multiple different partners as the scanning
window stepped along the sequence; the ScanFold-Fold algorithm creates a
comprehensive pair list (as well as all associated metrics) and highlights which base
pairs consistently yielded low G° z-scores1. This process is performed for each
nucleotide, ultimately generating a single structural model. During the initial scan,
61,774 unique bp were observed (Table S2); utilizing the ScanFold-Fold algorithm to
select only those base pairs with the most favorable G° z-score metrics resulted in
7,235 bp (Table S3). Of these base pairs, 6,134 had average G° z-scores less than or
equal to -1 and, remarkably, 2,956 had average z-scores less than or equal to -2 (or
around ~41% of all base pairs, spanning 19.8% of the genome). This dramatic
prevalence of ordered RNA folding is consistent with a recent study which found almost
half the SARS-CoV-2 genome contained regions with conserved RNA structure11.

Results in the 5 UTR
′

The full ScanFold-Scan results for the 5 UTR can be seen in Figure 2a. ScanFold-Fold
modeled four of the known stem loops in the 5 UTR leader region with z-scores < -2
(Fig. 2b). The start codon has been modeled as being unpaired, as opposed to
previous global models which placed the start codon within a large multibranch structure
(known as SL5; Fig. S1)7,17,18. As reported above, the scanning data around the start
codon resulted in positive G° z-scores, which in this case favor the formation of a
small hairpin where the 5 end of the SL5 basal stem would form and keeps the start
codon nucleotides unpaired (Fig. 2b). However, since the basal stem base pairs span
>120 nt (the window size used), we would not expect ScanFold to identify it. The
ScanFold model leaves 75% of the basal stem nucleotides unpaired, indicating that
local folds may not strongly compete against formation of the larger stem. Further,
though the basal stem of SL5 is not present in the ScanFold model, the terminal stem
loops (SL5a-c) are modeled consistent with recent global models of SL57,18 (Fig. 2b).

Frameshift Element
The FSE is an RNA structural motif which incorporates nucleotides of the overlapping
frames of ORF1a and ORF1b (nt 13476 to 13542; Fig. 3a). The full ScanFold-Scan
results for the FSE region can be seen in Figure 3a, where the 120 nt windows fully
incorporating those nucleotides (i.e. windows around nt 13,420, or 120 nt upstream of
the elements end) were found to yield the most negative z-scores. The base pairs which
correspond to these negative values are shown in the ScanFold-Fold model (Fig. 3b).
The ScanFold-Fold model of the FSE is largely consistent with recent models7,19. This
model consists of two stable hairpins: the first of which contains a loop sequence which

forms a pseudoknot by pairing with nucleotides upstream of the second hairpin (Fig.
3b). ScanFold cannot predict the pseudoknot directly, however the generated model
does leave the pseudoknot forming nucleotides sufficiently unpaired to allow for the
interaction to occur. Functional elements upstream of these hairpins are placed into an
alternative model by ScanFold. Here, the attenuator hairpin is embedded in a
multibranched structure along with the slippery sequence, which is predicted to form a
small three base pair stem. Notably, the only bps which had average z-scores < -2 for
the FSE region are found in the basal stem of this previously unreported multibranched
structure. These findings suggest the full frameshift element may incorporate more
nucleotides than previously described.
Results in the 3 UTR
′

The 3 UTRs of the Sarbecovirus genomes contain two RNA structural elements; a 3
UTR pseudoknot structure presumably required for replication20 and a mobile genetic
element with an undetermined function known as the 3 stem-loop II-like motif (s2m)21.
Under the current genome annotation (NC_045512.2) much of the previous 3 UTR
sequence is now found within an upstream open reading frame named ORF10
(however this has been recently reported as being an untranslated ORF as well22).
ScanFold’s model partially recapitulates a recent model of the region7 (blue pairs; Fig.
S2a), however, overall metrics for the region (including high ensemble diversity values
and positive G° z-scores; Table S1) suggest the region is unstructured and/or highly
dynamic. As such, the ScanFold model predicts the downstream region to be mostly
absent of structured elements. However, as mentioned earlier, the 3 UTR in the
negative sense actually yielded several significantly low z-score windows. Here,
ScanFold-Fold predicts this signal to arise from a large internally looped hairpin whose
terminal stem consists of the reverse complemented nucleotides of the s2m element
(Fig. S2b). Notably, the internal loop of the negative strand 3 UTR structure, as in the
forward strand, consists of a deeply conserved eight nucleotide primary sequence motif
17
. The unpaired nucleotides opposite this sequence are predicted to have highly
negative z-scores, suggesting flanking nucleotides may be ordered to encourage
internal loop formation (Fig. S2b). This structure in many ways mirrors the structure
reported for the positive sense (Fig. S2) which is not uncommon for RNA structured
elements23. In the negative strand however, the structure is more thermodynamically
stable yielding a more negative z-score - properties which provide evidence that RNA
structure may play a functional role in the negative strand as well23.

Novel Motifs with Strong Predicted Metrics for Structure/Function
Beyond recapitulating elements of described structure within the 5 UTR, FSE, and 3
UTR, ScanFold-Fold predicted over 500 individual motifs with strong predicted metrics
for structure/function. All motif models can be accessed on the RNAStructuromeDB
(https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/download/sars-cov-2-extractedstructures) and in
Table S4. Many motifs have better prediction metrics than either of the previously
described motifs. For example, the most negative G° z-scores are found downstream
of ORF1b (Fig. 1a). Notably, this region of the genome is discontinuously transcribed

into negative-sense RNA fragments which serve as intermediates during the generation
of positive sense sgRNAs. Although the mechanism of discontinuous transcription is
currently unknown, structural elements are known to play a functional role in terminating
negative strand transcription and/or generating sgRNA in other viral genomes.
There are seven core TRS sequences (5 -ACGAAC-3 ) present in the genome. These
are found between sgRNA coding regions and are involved in the addition of the 5
leader region of the genome onto each sgRNA. The mechanism is still unclear,
however, current models suggest leader addition is directed by base pairing between
nascent negative strand TRS sequences to the positive strand leader TRS22. All of the
TRS core sequences are present in ScanFold predicted motifs (Table S4). The region
encompassing the E coding sequence (ECDS) contains two of these TRS sequences in
relatively close proximity (the ECDS is a small ORF spanning only 228 nt). ScanFold
results for this region are shown in Figure 4. Notably, the start codon here is
overlapped by negative z-score windows (Fig. 4a), with individual windows reaching as
low as -5. The ScanFold-Fold predicted model for the region finds these low z-scores
generated via two hairpins near the start codon. The first hairpin incorporates both the
TRS sequence and the start codon into its loop and the second hairpin is a stable
structure, with average z-scores as reaching as low as -3.88 (Fig. 4b). Interestingly,
each of these structures are predicted to resemble transcription terminator hairpins24-26,
which could suggest a potential functional role.
′

′

′

Immediately upstream of Ecds is a region in the ORF3acds which generated the lowest zscore windows of the genome (as low as -6.4). This is presumably due to a stretch of 10
predicted hairpins which each generate z-scores < -2 (when folded individually; Table
S4). ScanFold finds this amount of ordering highly significant and models the 3 end of
the coding sequence to be mostly bound up in stable hairpins (Fig. S3).

Conservation of ScanFold Predicted Structural Elements
To determine the prevalence of ScanFold predicted RNA structures between
pathogenic coronavirus strains, a structural conservation analysis was performed
between SARS-Cov, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. Recent analyses indicated the MERS
genome was decidedly divergent from SARS-CoV-2, with only ~50% pairwise identity
between the genomes27 and too distant to yield powerful structural covariation support
for conserved structure7. However, the pathogenic SARS genomes are much less
distant, residing in the same Sarbecovirus genus of the Coronaviridae family27;
suggesting a greater likelihood of harboring identical RNA secondary structural motifs.
In order to determine the structural conservation of ScanFold models between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2, an alignment was generated using MAFFT28,29. The alignment
was consistent with earlier analyses resulting in a 79.0% pairwise identity for the
primary structure with similar results for the secondary structure, finding 4,860 of the
6,134 bp with average z-scores <= -1 being completely conserved (79%). Mutations
between the genomes were present in 2796 of ScanFold predicted base pairs with 1522
of those consistent with the predicted base pair and 1274 mutations inconsistent. While

the overall secondary structures for each genome correlate mostly with primary
structure, local regions were found to have higher degrees of conservation.
Consistent with their functional conservation across several Coronaviridae
genomes30,31, the FSE and 5 UTR regions had higher base pair conservation on
average. The 5 UTR stem loops (SL1-4 and SL5a-c) base pairs are 100% conserved
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and when mutations were present, they were
consistent with the ScanFold model (Fig. 2b). The two hairpins of the FSE had 20 of 21
base pairs conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with a single mutation
present in the base of the second stem (Fig. 3b). The multibranch structure upstream,
consisting of the attenuator and slippery sequence however, contained 8 mutations, 4 of
which are directly within, and inconsistent with the SARS-CoV attenuator hairpin
secondary structure (Fig. 3b). This provides little evidence for conservation of specific
base pairs in the attenuator, but rather, preservation of hairpin structures at these sites
in both viruses. The novel base pairs which extend the FSE model were conserved
between both genomes suggesting the basic architecture of this proposed extended
structure could be present and functional in both genomes.
′

′

The ScanFold predicted structures corresponding to previously observed structural
elements in the 3 UTR (blue pairs; Fig. S2a) are completely conserved between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2. The corresponding structured motifs detected in the negative
strand are similarly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S2b). The
negative strand motif consisting of the large internal loop, is conserved between
genomes as well, but as in the positive strand, mutations do occur within the s2m
region.
′

The novel motifs predicted near the Ecds TRS sequences have some evidence of
conservation (with two consistent mutations found in the stem of the first putative
terminator hairpin, and four consistent mutations in the final hairpin of the model
containing the start codon of the M coding region; Fig. 4b). The structures found in the
ORF3a region (Fig. S3) do not show evidence of specific base pair conservation,
however, the same region in SARS-CoV does appear similarly structured, yielding zscores as low as -5.49 (data not shown). This homologous region in SARS-CoV
however is only ~68% similar at the primary structure level and utilizes a different gene
architecture (with two overlapping reading frames).
METHODS
In silico analyses
The SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) genome sequence was downloaded from the NCBI
nucleotide database. ScanFold-Scan was run using a 120 nt window moving with a
single nucleotide step size. Each window was analyzed using the RNAfold algorithm
implemented in the ViennaRNA package (2.4.14)32. For each window the MFE G°
structure and value was predicted using the Turner energy model33,34 at 37°C. To

native sequence (MFEnative) is compared to MFE values calculated for 100 shuffled
version of the sequence with the same nucleotide composition (MFErandom) as shown in
Eq. 1; using an approach adapted from Clote et. al.35 Here, the standard deviation ( ) is

The p-value corresponds to the number of MFErandom values which were more
stable (more negative) than the MFEnative. In addition to these metrics, RNAfold partition
function calculations are utilized to characterize the potential structural diversity of the
native sequence. These include the ensemble diversity (ED) and the centroid structure.
The centroid structure depicts the base pairs which were “most common” (i.e. had the
minimal base pair distance) between all the Boltzmann-ensemble conformations
predicted for the native sequence. The ED then attempts to quantify the variety of
different structures which were present in the ensemble (where higher numbers indicate
multiple structures unique from the predicted MFE and low numbers indicate the
presence of a dominant MFE structure highly represented in the ensemble).
For comparisons made between the Sarbecovirus genomes, the SARS-CoV genome
(NC_004718.3) was aligned to SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) using the MAFFT
webserver28 with default settings (in this case the FFT-ns-i method13 was implemented).
CONCLUSION
This work lays out the predicted local RNA folding landscape of the SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome. In addition to general trends in RNA structure, we present unique motifs
from base pairs that contribute most to the exceptional thermodynamic stability of
SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. This work lays out the potential druggable RNA structurome of
SARS-CoV-2 to drive forward both basic research into structure/function as well as
efforts to target this virus using small molecule therapeutics.

Figure 3. Full analysis of the FSE region from SARS-CoV-2. a) The results of the full
ScanFold pipeline are shown. ScanFold metrics and base pairs have been loaded into
the IGV desktop browser36. Metric type and ranges are listed on the left side of the
panel (metric descriptions can be found in the Methods section). Arc diagrams for
ScanFold model base pairs are colored based on their average z-score (blue for <= -2,
green for <= -1, and yellow for <= 0). b) The ScanFold RNA 2D structures for the full
FSE region are shown. All differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
primary structure are reported directly next to the corresponding nucleotide of SARSCoV-2 (with the corresponding SARS-CoV nucleotide in a red circle). Structures have
been visualized here using VARNA37.

Figure 4. ScanFold results of the region encompassing the Ecds. a) The full ScanFoldScan metrics are shown. b) ScanFold-Fold predicted model for the region is shown
here. Nucleotides here are colored according to their average z-score from Table S2.
The TRS nucleotides have been highlighted and labeled with a dark blue outline, and
the start and stop codons have been highlighted and labeled green and red
respectively. Differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been annotated
as described in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure S2. Model of the forward and reverse strand of the 3′ UTR of SARS-CoV-2.
a) Model of the SARS-CoV-2 3 UTR from Rangan et. al. annotated with ScanFold
metrics. b) ScanFold model of the negative strand of the 3 UTR. Here the region was
refolded in RNAfold using base pairs with z-score averages <-2 as constraints. Base
pairs here are colored based on their presence in the ScanFold model of the region,
and nucleotides are colored based on the average z-score from Table S2.
