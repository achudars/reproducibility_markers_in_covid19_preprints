Abstract
The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target.
PLpro is involved in the cleavage of viral polyproteins and antagonizing host innate
immune response through its deubiquitinating and deISG15ylating activities, rendering it
a high profile antiviral drug target. Through a FRET-based high-throughput screening,
several hits were identified as PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values at the single-digit
micromolar range. Subsequent lead optimization led to potent inhibitors with IC50 values
ranging from 0.56 to 0.90 µM. To help prioritize lead compounds for the cellular antiviral
assay against SARS-CoV-2, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP assay that is
suitable for quantifying the intracellular enzymatic inhibition potency of PLpro inhibitors in
the BSL-2 setting. Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP-PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2
and Jun9-72-2, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 hACE2 cells with EC50
values of 8.89 and 8.32 µM, respectively, which were 3-fold more potent than GRL0617
(EC50 = 25.1 µM). The X-ray crystal structures of PLpro in complex with GRL0617
showed that binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational change in
the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation. Overall, the PLpro inhibitors identified in
this study represent promising starting points for further development as SARS-CoV-2
antivirals, and FlipGFP-PLpro assay might be a suitable surrogate for screening PLpro
inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to 120,105,958 confirmed cases and 2,657,629
deaths as of March 15, 2021, rendering it the worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish
flu. The etiological agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded positive sense
RNA virus that belongs to the beta coronavirus family. Two additional coronaviruses
within the same family, the SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have caused epidemics in
humans with mortality rates of 9.6% and 34.3%, respectively. Although SARS-CoV-2
has a lower mortality rate of 2.2% compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it has led
to far greater death tolls due to its higher transmission. SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARSCoV and MERS-CoV in that it has a long incubation time after the initial infection (~ 2
weeks), and a large percentage of infected patients continue to shed the virus while
being asymptomatic, presenting a daunting task for surveillance and containment.
Three mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna, and Johnson and
Johnson have been approved by FDA in the United States. For small molecule antivirals,
remdesivir received FDA approval on October 22, 2020. Although the polymerase of
SARS-CoV-2 has proof-reading function, it continues to mutate at a rate about 10-6 per
site per cycle.1 Several mutant viruses have already emerged and widely circulated
among humans since the beginning of the pandemic.2 Therefore, there is a dire need of
additional antivirals with a novel mechanism of action. Antivirals are not substituents of
vaccines, but rather an important complement to help combat the pandemic. Among the
viral proteins that have been actively pursued as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug targets, the
main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are the most promising ones.3,4
Both Mpro and PLpro are involved in the proteolytic digestion of the viral polyproteins

pp1a and pp1ab, yielding individual functional viral proteins for the replication complex
formation. PLpro cleaves at three sites with the recognition sequence “LXGG XX”.5 PLpro
has been shown to play additional roles in dysregulating host immune response and
impairing the host type I interferon antiviral effect through its deubiquitinating and
deISG15ylating (interferon-induced gene 15) activities, respectively.6-8 SARS-CoV-2
PLpro cleaves ISG15 and polyubiquitin modifications from cellular proteins, and inhibition
of PLpro led to the accumulation of ISG15-conjugates and poly-ubiquitin-conjugates.9
While SARS-CoV PLpro prefers ubiquitinated substrates, the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro prefers
the ISGlyated proteins as substrates.6-8 PLpro is part of a membrane anchored multidomain protein named non-structural protein 3 (nsp-3), an essential component of the
replicase-transcriptase complex. The multi-functional roles of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro render
it a prominent antiviral drug target. A substantial morbidity and mortality associated with
COVID-19 infection is caused by cytokine storm,10 and suppressing host immune
response using dexamethasone and baricitinib has been shown to provide therapeutic
benefits in the treatment of severe infections.
A significant progress has been made in developing SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
inhibitors3,4,11-13 and the Pfizer compound PF-07304814 currently in phase 1 clinical
trial.14 In comparison, PLpro represents a more challenging drug target, and GRL0617
remains one of the most potent PLpro inhibitors reported to date despite several highthroughput screening and medicinal chemistry optimization campaigns.8,15 GRL0617
was originally developed against SARS-CoV PLpro.16 As SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
PLpro share a sequence identity of 83% and similarity of 90%, GRL0617 was also
repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and it was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with

IC50 values of around 2 µM and the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with EC50 values
around 20 µM from multiple studies.8,9,15,17
In this study, we report our progress in developing novel SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
inhibitors. Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, we conducted a high-throughput
screening against the Enamine 50K diversity compound library and identified two hits
Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 with single-digit micromolar IC50 values. Upon validating the
hits using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and native mass spectrometry binding
assays, a focused library of structural analogs were designed and tested to dissect the
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Several compounds have been identified to
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with submicromolar potency. To prioritize lead compounds for
the antiviral assay against SARS-CoV-2, we developed the FlipGFP assay that is
suitable for quantifying the intracellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL2 setting.
Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2,
showed 3-fold improvement than GRL0617 in the cellular antiviral assay against SARSCoV-2. X-ray crystal structures showed that binding of GRL0617 to the wild-type (WT)
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro induced a conformational change in the BL2 loop to the more closed
conformation. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro reported herein represent promising hits
for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and FlipGFP PLpro assay might be
useful in testing the cellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting.

Two constructs of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were expressed in E. Coli, one with Hig-tag
(PLpro-His) and another without the tag (PLpro). To profile the proteolytic activity of PLpro
in cleaving the viral polyprotein, we developed a FRET based enzymatic assay with the
peptide substrate 4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)benzoic acid (Dabcyl)–
FTLRGG/APTKV–5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (Edans), which
corresponds to the nsp2-nsp3 junction from the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein. The
enzymatic activity kcat/Km of PLpro-His and PLpro were 340 M-1S-1 and 255 M-1S-1 (Table
S1), respectively, which were similar to previous reports,8,17 suggesting both constructs
were enzymatically active. The SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was also reported to have
deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities. Accordingly, we characterized the
deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro using the Ub-AMC
and ISG-AMC substrates, respectively, in the enzymatic assay. It was found that the
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is more efficient in cleaving the ubiquitin (Ub) and ISG15 (ISG)
modifications than the viral polyprotein, with kcat/Km values of 1,070 and 1.67x105 M-1S-1
(Table S2), respectively. This substrate preference is in agreement with results reported
by Gal et al,17 and SARS-CoV PLpro was also reported to have similar substrate
preference.18 Significantly, the deISGylating activity is 156-fold higher than the
deubiquitinating activity, which is consistent with previous reports that the SARS-CoV-2
PLpro prefers ISG15 over ubiquitin as a substrate.5-9

The HTS assay was optimized in 384-well plates using the FRET substrate, which
gave a Z’ factor of 0.668 with a signal to noise ratio (S/B) of 11.2, indicating that this
was a robust assay (Fig. 1). We then performed the HTS against the enamine library,
which consists of 50,240 structurally diverse compounds. GRL0617 was included as a
positive control.

representative control plate (column 1 to 20 with PLpro protein, column 21 to 24 with
buffer only; 1 µl DMSO was added to column 1 to 10 and 21 to 24; 1 µl GRL0617 was
added to column 11 to 20), the signal to base ratio (S/B) is 11.2, and the calculated Z’
factor is 0.688.

Hits showing more than 50% inhibition were repurchased from Enamine and titrated

in the FRET-based enzymatic assay to determine the IC50 values (Fig. 2A and Table

secondary assay to characterize the binding of the hits with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (Fig. 2B

and Table S3). The most potent two hits Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 (Fig. 2C) had IC50
values of 7.29 ± 1.03 and 6.67 ± 0.05 µM, respectively. Compounds Jun9-13-7 and
Jun9-13-9 also increased the thermal stability of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by 2.98 ± 0.09 and
2.18 ± 0.29 oC (Table S3), which is consistent with their enzymatic inhibition. In
comparison, GRL0617 had an IC50 value of 2.05 ± 0.12 µM, and increased the protein
stability by 3.52 ± 0.27 oC in the DSF assay (Table S3). The potency of GRL0617 in
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro from our study is consistent with recent reports.6-9 The rest
of the hits had weak enzymatic inhibition (IC50 > 10 µM) and showed marginal binding to
PLpro, therefore they were not further pursued (Table S3). Both compound Jun9-13-7
and Jun9-13-9 also inhibit the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities with IC50
values ranging from 4.93 to 12.5 µM (Fig. 2D and Table S4). In contrast, neither of
these two compounds inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at up to 200 µM (fig. S2),
suggesting the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by these two compounds are specific.
The binding of Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was further
characterized using the native mass spectrometry (Fig. 2E). It was shown that both
Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 showed dose-dependent binding to PLpro with binding
stoichiometry of one drug per PLpro, similar to the positive control GRL0617. Enzymatic
kinetic studies showed that compounds Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9 are non-covalent
inhibitors with Ki values of 3.96 and 2.10 µM, respectively (fig. S3). The LineweaverBurk plots yielded an intercept at the Y-axis, suggesting that both compounds are
competitive inhibitors similar to GRL0617 (fig. S3).

Lead optimization of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors.
To further optimize the enzymatic inhibition of Jun9-13-7 and Jun9-13-9, 13
structural analogs were purchased from Enamine (Fig. 3A) and 34 compounds were
synthesized (Fig. 3B) to elucidate the structure-activity relationships (SAR). It was found
that the hydroxyl substation at the left phenyl ring is critical for the activity as
methylation led to significant loss of enzymatic inhibition (Jun9-13-9 vs Jun9-25-4). The
methylene linker and the methyl substation on the link are both important for the
enzymatic inhibition (Jun9-13-9 vs Jun9-26-2). Similarly, the ortho-methyl or chloride
substation on the right phenyl ring is critical for the activity (Jun9-13-7 vs Jun9-29-5;
Jun9-13-7 vs Jun9-13-4). Next, guided by this initial SAR results, 34 analogs were
designed and synthesized (Fig. 3B). Nine compounds had IC50 values less than 1 µM
including Jun9-75-4 (IC50 = 0.62 µM), Jun9-85-1 (IC50 = 0.66 µM), Jun9-84-3 (IC50 =
0.67 µM), Jun9-87-1 (IC50 = 0.87 µM), Jun9-72-2 (IC50 = 0.67 µM), Jun9-87-2 (IC50 =
0.90 µM), Jun9-87-3 (IC50 = 0.80 µM), Jun9-75-5 (IC50 = 0.56 µM), and Jun9-53-2 (IC50
= 0.89 µM). Among them, Jun9-75-4 was the most potent PLpro inhibitor with an IC50 of
0.62 µM, a 10-fold increase compared to Jun9-13-9 (IC50 = 6.67 µM). Jun9-75-4 is also
3-fold more potent than GRL0617 (IC50 = 2.05 ± 0.12 µM), representing one of the most
potent PLpro inhibitors reported to date.

Development of FlipGFP assay for testing the cellular activity of SARS-CoV-2
PLpro inhibitors.

One of the challenges in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug discovery is that SARS-CoV-2
is a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) pathogen, which limits the number of drug candidates that
can be screened. To help prioritize lead compounds for the antiviral assay with
infectious SARS-CoV-2, we developed a cell-based FlipGFP assay for SARS-CoV-2
PLpro that is suitable for testing the intracellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL2
setting. The advantages of cell-based PLpro assay over the FRET-based enzymatic
assay include but not limited to: 1) it can eliminate compounds that either cytotoxic or
membrane impermeable; 2) In contrast to the standard FRET-based assay, PLpro
cleaves the substrate in the cell cytoplasm in the FlipGFP assay, which is a close
mimetic of the viral polyprotein cleavage by PLpro in virus-infected cell. It is known that
cysteine proteases are susceptible to re-dox active compounds as well as non-specific
alkylating chemicals such as ebselen.19,20 The FlipGFP PLpro assay is expected to rule
out such promiscuous compounds as the substrate is cleaved under the reducing
intracellular environment.
In the assay design, the 10th and 11th β-strands from the GFP protein were
separated from the rest of the GFP β-barrel (β-strands 1-9) (Fig. 4A).21,22 The 10th and
11th β-strands were linked through the PLpro cleavage site and a heterodimerized coiled
coils E5/K5. In the absence of the PLpro, the 10th and 11th β-strands are conformationally
restrained and unable to associate with the GFP β-barrel 1-9. When the cleavage site is
digested by the PLpro, the 11th β-strand can then flip its orientation and associate with
GFP β-barrel 1-9 together with the 10th β-strand, leading to restoration of the green
fluorescence signal (Fig. 4A). A red fluorescent protein mCherry was included within the
construct via a “self-cleaving” 2A peptide to act as the transfection control (Fig. 4B), and

the normalized ratio of green fluorescence signal over red fluorescence signal is
proportional to the enzymatic activity of PLpro. Cells transfected with FlipGFP-PLpro but
without the PLpro showed no green fluorescence signal (Fig. 4C, 6th row), suggesting
host proteases are unable to cleavage the PLpro substrate sequence, thereby
eliminating the background signal interference. A strong green fluorescence signal was
observed only when there was a match between the cleavage site and the
corresponding protease (Fig. 4C, 2nd and 7th rows). Specifically, little or no GFP signal
was observed when the cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and a construct
containing either the TEV cleavage site (FlipGFP-TEV) (Fig. 4C, 4th row) or the Mpro
cleavage site (FlipGFP-Mpro) (Fig. 4C, 3rd row). Similarly, little or no GFP signal was
observed when the cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and a construct
containing the PLpro cleavage site (FlipGFP-PLpro) (Fig. 4C, 5th row). In contrast, strong
green fluorescence signals were observed when the cells were transfected with PLpro
and FlipGFP-PLpro (Fig. 4C, 7th row) or Mpro and FlipGFP-Mpro (Fig. 4C, 2nd row).
With the established assay condition, we then screened nine most potent PLpro
inhibitors with IC50 values less than 1 µM from the FRET-based enzymatic assay (Fig.
3). GRL0617 and GC376 were included as positive and negative controls, respectively.
The initial hit Jun9-13-9 was also included. Compounds were added 3 h post
transfection, and GFP and mCherry fluorescence signals were measured at 48 h post
transfection using the Cytation 5 imager reader. A dose dependent decrease of the GFP
signal was observed with increasing concentrations of GRL0617 (Fig. 4D), and
quantification of the normalized GFP/mCherry ratio gave an EC50 value of 9.29 ± 3.45
µM. In contrast, GC376 had no effect on the intensity of green fluorescence signal

(EC50 > 60 µM) (Fig. 4E), suggesting the FlipGFP assay is suitable for the screening of
PLpro inhibitors. Among the ten compounds tested in the cell-based FlipGFP assay,
compounds Jun9-53-2, Jun9-72-2, Jun9-75-4, Jun9-85-1, and Jun9-87-1 had EC50
values less than 10 µM, while compounds Jun9-84-3, Jun9-87-2. And Jun9-87-3 were
less active and had EC50 values between 10.16 to 17.07 µM. Compound Jun9-75-5 was
not active (EC50 > 60 µM), despite its potent activity in the FRET-based enzymatic
assay (IC50 = 0.56 µM).

Cellular antiviral activity of PLpro inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2
Based on the FlipGFP-PLpro assay results, we selected two compounds Jun9-53-2
and Jun9-72-2 and tested their cellular antiviral activity against the infectious SARSCoV-2 in two cell lines, the Caco-2 hACE2, and the Vero E6. The Caco-2 hACE2 cell
line expresses endogenous TMPRSS2 and was transfected to overexpress hACE2,
rending it a physiological relevant cell line model that is close to the human airway
epithelial cells. GRL0617 was included as a positive control. It was found that all three
compounds had more potent inhibition in Caco-2 hACE2 cells than the Vero E6 cells
(Fig. 5). Consistent with the enzymatic inhibition results, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2 had

X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with GRL0617.
The complex structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with GRL0617 was determined at 2.50
Å resolution, providing insight to its mechanism of inhibition. There are two monomers
per asymmetric unit in the P21 space group. Unambiguous electron density reveals
GRL0617 binds to the S3-S4 subpockets of the PLpro active site in a noncovalent
manner (Fig. 6A). The naphthalene ring is positioned in the S4 site, where it forms
hydrophobic interactions with Pro247 and Pro248. Upon ligand binding, Tyr268 flips
towards the central domain of GRL0617 (Fig. 6B) to π-stack with the naphthalene and
benzene rings. At the 1-napthalene position is a carbon stereocenter that is substituted
with an (R) methyl group that sticks directly into the core of the S4 subpocket. This
stereocenter and the methyl group are nearly superimposable with the γ and δ1 carbons
of the P4 leucine for the ISG15 substrate in the previously determined complex
structure (Fig. 6C), demonstrating the non-polar features of the S4 site as well as the
complementarity of the methyl moiety with the core of this subpocket.23 The
carboxamide nitrogen of GRL0617 serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the
sidechain of Asp164, while the oxygen accepts a hydrogen bond from the mainchain
amide of Gln269. The disubstituted benzene spans the central substrate channel,
partially occupying the P5-P3 substrate mainchain binding site, where it forms π- π
interactions with the sidechains of Tyr268/Gln269, and the backbone amides of
Gly163/Asp164. The ortho-methyl group projects towards the catalytic core forming
hydrophobic interactions with the S2 site, forcing Leu162 slightly outwards compared
with the apo structure , while the meta-nitrogen orients towards the S5 site, causing
Gln269 to swing inwards to accept a hydrogen bond. The conformational changes of

multiple active site residues upon GRL0617 binding highlights the flexibility of the
substrate recognition sites, which corresponds to the broad substrate profile of SARSCoV-2 PLpro and can be leveraged in future inhibitor design.

rearrangement is observed in the loop comprising residues Asn267-Cys270 upon
GRL0617 binding. These movements are indicated with arrows. (C) Superimposition

catalytic mutant C111S in complex with GRL0617 (PDB ID 7JIR, light blue and dark

One of the unique aspects of GRL0167 is that it does not interact with the catalytic
core, but instead binds to a distal portion of the active site. Other research groups have
determined complex structures of PLpro with GRL0617 with its catalytic cysteine, Cys
111, mutated to a serine, presumably to increase its propensity to crystallize (PDB IDs:
7JIR (2.1 Å) and 7CJM (3.2 Å)).24,25 When the three structures are compared, the
GRL0167 adopts a nearly identical pose. Minor differences in the side chain
conformations of Glu167 and Gln269 are observed. However, there is a significant
difference in the pose of Leu162 between the WT and the C111S mutants (Fig. 6D). In
our WT structure, Leu162 inserts into the core of the protein, where it maintains an
interatomic distance of 3.4 Å with the catalytic cysteine. In contrast, Leu162 of both
C111S structures flip outwards, towards the solvent. In the higher resolution structure
(PDB ID 7JIR), an acetate from the crystallization condition is modelled in the active site.
When superimposed with our WT structure, this acetate clashes with Cys111 (closest
distance 2.5 Å) and Leu162 (3.0 Å). In the lower-resolution C111S mutant complexed

with GRL0617 (PDB ID 7CJM), no acetate is modelled, but Leu162 adopts the same
conformation as the higher-resolution C111S structure (PDB ID 7JIR). Further
inspection of the 2Fo-Fc map of 7JCM reveals there is unmodeled density corresponding
to the acetate from PDB ID 7JIR. Interestingly, this experiment did not use acetate in
their crystallization condition. Therefore, the density in the catalytic core of both C111S
structures likely corresponds to a species of unknown identity that preferentially
interacts with a serine residue.

CONCLUSION
Given the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV outbreak
in 2003 was a dire warning that was gravely overlooked in retrospect. Looking forward,
it is imperative that therapeutics are developed that are not only effective against SARSCoV-2, but against future strains of similar coronaviruses. PLpro is a high profile drug
target, partly because it is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
sharing 83% sequence similarity. Furthermore, inhibitors like GRL0617 are equally
effective against both viruses, with a Ki of 0.49 µM and 0.57 µM, against SARS-CoV
PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro.26 Likewise, all critical active site residues that interact with
GRL0617 are conserved, consequently, the binding poses are nearly identical (fig.
S4).26 These similarities would indicate that PLpro inhibitors might retain their activity
against future strains of SARS coronaviruses.
Previous attempts to discover SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors through HTS by others
have failed to identify hits with improved enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral
activity.8,9 Structural analogs of GRL0617 were also designed and synthesized,

however, none of them showed improved enzymatic inhibition.15 Part of the reason for
the difficulty in targeting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is the lack of S1 and S2 pockets, which
leaves only S3 and S4 pockets for inhibitor binding. Among the reported SARS-CoV or
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors, GRL0617 is one of the most potent compound. However,
it had weak antiviral activity (EC50 > 20 µM). In this study, we attempted to identify more
potent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors through a HTS. Based on two promising hits Jun913-7 and Jun9-13-9, a library of analogs was designed and synthesized, among which
several compounds had submicromolar IC50 values in the FRET-based enzymatic assay.
To alleviate the burden of relying on BSL-3 facility to test the antiviral activity of PLpro
inhibitors, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP PLpro assay, which can be used to
quantify the intracellular enzymatic inhibition of PLpro in a BSL-2 lab. The FlipGFP PLpro
assay is a close mimetic of the virus-infected cell in which PLpro cleaves its substrate in
the native intracellular reducing environment. The advantage of the FlipGFP PLpro assay
overt the standard FRET-based enzymatic assay is that it can rule out compounds that
are either cytotoxic or membrane impermeable or non-specifically modify the catalytic
cysteine through oxidation or alkylation. GRL0617 showed an EC50 of 9.29 µM in the
FlipGFP PLpro assay, while the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor GC376 was not active (EC50 >
60 µM), suggesting this assay was suitable for testing PLpro inhibitors. Among the ten
PLpro inhibitors tested in the FlipGFP PLpro assay, five compounds Jun9-53-2, Jun9-72-2,
Jun9-75-4, Jun9-85-1, and Jun9-87-1 had EC50 values less than 10 µM. Next, two
prioritized hits Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2 were advanced to the cellular antiviral assay
against SARS-CoV-2. Both compounds showed improved antiviral activity than

GRL0617 and the EC50 values were consistent between the FlipGFP PLpro assay and
the cellular antiviral assay.
We also solved the X-ray crystal structure of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in
complex with GRL0617. Binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational
change in the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation. In contrast, a larger inhibitor
VIR251 stabilizes the BL2 loop in the open conformation.5 The intrinsic flexibility of the
BL2 loop implies that structurally diverse inhibitors might be able to fit in the S3-S4
pockets.
In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors developed in this study represent
promising hits for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and the FlipGFP PLpro
assay is a suitable surrogate for testing the cellular activity of PLpro inhibitors in the BSL2 setting.

Protein expression and purification.
Detailed expression and purification of C-terminal His tagged SARS-CoV-2 PLPro (PLproHis) were described in our previous publication.4 Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 papain-like
protease (PLpro) gene (ORF 1ab 1564−1876) from strain BetaCoV/ Wuhan/WIV04/2019
with E. coli codon optimization in the pET28b(+) vector was ordered from GenScript.
The pET28b(+) plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and protein expression
was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG when OD600 was around 0.8 for 24 h at 18 °C. Then

Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) in a 10 000 kDa molecular weight cutoff
dialysis tubing.
The expression and purification of un-tagged SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (PLpro) was carried out
as follows: the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro gene (ORF 1ab 1564−1876) was subcloned from
pET28b(+) to pE-SUMO vector according to the manufacturer’s protocol (LifeSensors

For the measurements of Km/Vmax: with Peptide-Edans as a substrate, the final PLpro
protein concentration is 200 nM, and substrate concentration ranges from 0 to 200 µM;
with Ub-AMC as a substrate, the final PLpro protein concentration is 50 nM, and Ub-AMC

The main protease (Mpro) enzymatic assays were carried out in Mpro reaction buffer
containing 20 mM HEPES pH 6.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol and 4
mM DTT as described previously.3,4,19,20

Cell-based FlipGFP PLpro assay
Plasmid pcDNA3-TEV-flipGFP-T2A-mCherry was ordered from Addgene (Cat #
124429). SARS CoV-2 PLpro cleavage site LRGGAPTK or SARS CoV-2 Mpro cleavage
site AVLQSGFR was introduced into pcDNA3-flipGFP-T2A-mCherry via overlapping
PCRs to generate a fragment with SacI and HindIII sites at the ends. SARS CoV-2 Mpro
and PLpro expression plasmids pcDNA3.1 SARS2 Mpro and pcDNA3.1 SARS2 PLpro was
ordered from Genscript (Piscataway NJ) with codon optimization.
For transfection, 96-well Greiner plate (Cat # 655090) was seeded with 293T cells to
overnight 70-90% confluency. 50 ng pcDNA3-flipGFP-T2A-mCherry plasmid and 50 ng
protease expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 were used each well in the presence of
transfection reagent TransIT-293 (Mirus). 3 hrs after transfection, 1 µl testing compound
was added to each well at 100-fold dilution. Images were acquired 2 days after
transfection with Cytation 5 imaging reader (Biotek) GFP and mCherry channels; and
were analyzed with Gen5 3.10 software (Biotek). SARS CoV-2 PLpro protease activity
was calculated by the ration of GFP signal sum intensity over mCherry signal sum
intensity. FlipGFP-PLP assay IC50 value was calculated by plotting GFP/mCherry signal
over the applied compound concentration with a 4 parameters dose-response function
in prism 8. The mCherry signal alone was utilized to determine the compound
cytotoxicity.

Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF).
The thermal shift binding assay (TSA) was carried out using a Thermal Fisher
QuantStudioTM 5 Real-Time PCR System as described previously.3,4,19,20 Briefly, 4 µM
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein (PLpro) in PLpro reaction buffer was incubated with 40 µM of
compounds at 30 °C for 30 min. 1X SYPRO orange dye was added and fluorescence of
the well was monitored under a temperature gradient range from 20 °C to 90 °C with
0.05 °C/s incremental step. Measured Tm was plotted against compound concentration
with one-site binding function in Prism 8.
Native Mass Spectrometry.
Before MS analysis, the protein was buffer exchanged using two Micro Bio-Spin
columns (Bio-Rad) and diluted into 0.2M ammonium acetate to a concentration of 10
µM. Each drug was diluted with 100% ethanol to concentrations of 100, 200, and 400

μM. Imidazole, a charge reducing reagent, was added to each sample to stabilize the
drug bound state at final concentration of 40 mM. For each sample, 0.5 μl ligand was
added and dried down in each tube prior to the addition of 0.5 μL of 40 mM DTT, 0.5 μl
of 400 mM imidazole, and 4 μl of protein for a final concentration of 4 mM DTT and 8

μM protein. Final ligand concentrations were either 10, 20, or 40 μM.

DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS. Immediately before the viral inoculation, the tested
compounds in a three-fold dilution concentration series were also added to the wells in

Crystallization and structure determination
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-His (PLpro-His) protein was concentrated and loaded to a HiLoad

Tris pH 8.0 and 5 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and incubated with GRL0617 in
a 1:1 molar ratio for 1 hour at room temperature, then concentrated to 8 mg/mL. PLpro
crystals were grown in a hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion apparatus by mixing 0.75 µl of 8
mg/mL PLpro-GRL0617 with 0.75 ul of well solution (30 % PEG 4,000, 0.2 M Li2SO4,
