Abstract
In the light of the recent accumulated knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its mode
of human cells invasion, the binding of viral spike glycoprotein to human Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor plays a central role in cell entry. We designed
a series of peptides mimicking the N-terminal helix of hACE2 protein which contains
most of the contacting residues at the binding site and have a high helical folding
propensity in aqueous solution. Our best peptide mimics bind to the virus spike protein
with high affinity and are able to block SARS-CoV-2 human pulmonary cell infection
with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar range. These first in class
blocking peptide mimics represent powerful tools that might be used in prophylactic
and therapeutic approaches to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a pandemic,
claiming at the time of writing more than 600,000 deaths and over 14.5 million
confirmed cases world-wide between December 2019 and July 2020.1 Since SARSCoV-2 discovery2,3 and identification, the energy deployed by the scientific community
has made it possible to generate an extraordinary wealth of information. Whatever, to
date, clinically approved vaccines or drugs are lacking.4 Indeed, no specific drugs
targeting the virus are available5 and many clinical trials have been engaged with
SARS-CoV-2 non-specific treatments.6 The structural and biochemical basis of
infection mechanism has been investigated, highlighting that the virus cell-surface
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is targeting human receptors.4,7 Human Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and the cellular Transmembrane Protease Serine 2
(TMPRSS2) have been identified as major actors of the virus entry into human cells.
With the goal of preventing the SARS-CoV-2 from infecting human cells,
blocking the interaction between hACE2 and the virus spike protein has been
validated. Indeed, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissues
using clinical-grade soluble ACE2 was recently demonstrated.8 Likewise, an
engineered stable mini-protein mimicking three helices of hACE2 to plug SARS-CoV2 spikes9 was described, but its capacity to block viral infection was not demonstrated.
If several in silico designed peptides were proposed to prevent formation of the fusion
core,10 first attempts to design a peptide binder derived from hACE2 proved to be a
difficult task, leading to mitigated results.11
Thus, starting from the published crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike
receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound to hACE2,12 we designed peptide mimics of the

N-terminal hACE2 helix which interact with spike protein. We report here the strategy
implemented to optimize the design of our peptide mimic, its high helical folding
propensity in water and its ability to block cells infection by SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50
in the nM range upon binding to spike RBD with strong affinity. We also demonstrate
the non-toxicity of our mimic at concentrations 150 times higher than IC50 on pulmonary
cell lines.
Results
Design of peptides mimicking helix H1 of hACE2
We first examined the complex between hACE2 and the surface spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB 6m0j)12 in order to highlight the important contacts and some
relevant characteristics of the interacting hACE2 sequence (Figure 1).

hACE2 interacting with spike protein are colored in red. Apart from H1 helix, 8 additional residues from
hACE2 are indicated in black. 1C. H1 helix sequence showing 12 interacting residues in red. Residue
positions in green were considered as possible substitution sites for helical peptide design.

Twenty residues from hACE2 were identified12 as close contacts, using a
distance cut-off of 4 Å. These interactions occur mainly through the N-terminal a-helix
H1 of hACE2 (Figure 1A). This a-helix, composed of 27 residues (from S19 to L45,
Figure 1C) contains 12 residues (highlighted in red in Figure 1B) involved in
hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.12
Our strategy was to design a peptide with high helical folding propensity and
retaining most of the binding affinity of hACE2 to spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2, using
natural amino acids13. Indeed, we preferred not using complex chemical tools known
to stabilize a-helix14,15 in order to limit developability constraints. To design our mimics,

we set up an optimization process with the dual aim of optimizing the helical content
and limiting the antigenicity, to avoid triggering a neutralizing immune response that
would compromise the peptide therapeutic potential. A combination of the Agadir
program,16 an algorithm developed to predict the helical content of peptides, and the
semi-empirical method reported by Kolaskar17,18 to highlight the number of antigenic
determinants (AD), was iteratively used.
We observed that the N-terminal sequence of H1 helix, composed of 4 residues
(S19TIE22), corresponds to a consensus N-capping box motif (SXXE).19 A capping box
features reciprocal backbone-side-chain hydrogen-bonds favoring helix initiation.
Although this sequence does not adopt the H-bonded capping conformation in the
crystal structure of the full protein, it could still be an important stabilizing element in
the isolated helix when extracted from the protein context. These observations led us
to keep 14 residues from the native H1 helix of hACE2 as contact residues or putative
stabilizing capping box. The 13 left residues that are not essential for the interaction
were considered as possible sites for amino acid substitutions (Figure 1C). We thus
substituted non-essential positions by Ala and/or Leu residues displaying higher helical
folding propensities and calculated the peptide helical content after each substitution
(Table S1).
A peptide sequence optimization was then realized to lower the antigenicity
while keeping the helical propensity thanks to an iterative residue scanning and
calculation of the helical content variation upon new substitutions (Table S2). This
strategy highlighted the influence of the residue N33 in the native sequence. Indeed, if
the N33/L33 substitution systematically improved the helical content, it was always at
the expense of antigenicity. Conversely, the L33/N33 substitution reduced the
antigenicity at the expense of helical content. The solution was found by L33/M33
substitution decreasing the number of AD.
The H1 helix of ACE2 adopts a kinked conformation in the crystal structure,
leading to a distorted CO/HN hydrogen bond network between H34/D38 and E35/L39
residues. Therefore, we considered introducing a proline as this residue is known to
induce local kinks or distortions in natural helices.20,21 D38 was classed as a contact
residue, while L39 side chain is not involved in any direct interaction. Consequently,
L39 position was selected for substitution by proline (peptide P5, Table 1).
In order to increase the helical content to a maximum level, this iterative study
was also applied to longer peptide sequences starting from the 29-mers native one,
albeit at the expense of antigenicity. Diverse combinations of N- and C-terminus

capping groups were also considered (free extremities or N-acetyl, C-carboxamide
groups).
Finally, we examined the possibility of promoting additional side chain contacts
provided by ACE2 residues that do not belong to H1 helix. Y83 residue appeared as a
good candidate as it lies very close in space to A25 in H1 helix. Molecular modeling
was carried out on H1 helix analogs in which A25 was replaced by tyrosine or homotyrosine (hTyr) residues (Figure S1). Calculations showed that hTyr residue was able
to project the phenol ring in the adequate 3D space to mimic Y83 position. Of note,
hTyr is a natural amino acid.22
Three peptides were selected as controls in our optimization process, P1 (native
sequence), P1scr (Scrambled peptide from P1) and Ppen (described by Pentelute &
al. in a longer biotinylated and pegylated construct and termed SBP1 as a putative
spike binder).11
The results highlighting the progression in the helical content and the number
of antigenic determinants is reported in Table 1 for the most relevant peptide mimics
(see table S1, S2 and S3 for all peptide mimics designed and/or synthesized). These
peptides were synthesized on a 5 to 20 mg scale from Fmoc-protected amino acids
utilizing standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods on rink amide resin
(See Methods).

The designed peptides highlight an excellent correlation between calculated and
experimentally determined helical content by circular dichroism in aqueous
media
The conformation of synthesized peptides in aqueous solution was investigated
by CD spectroscopy.24 Figure 2 shows the superimposed CD spectra of 12 peptides,
including the control ones, i.e. P1 (native sequence), P1scr (Scramble), Ppen. The
CD spectra of peptides P1 (native), P1scr (scrambled) are characteristic of a
predominant random coil structure with a negative minimum near 200 nm, as expected.
Similarly, Ppen described as a helical peptide sequence11 adopted also a random coil
conformation in solution. For all other peptides, the CD spectra exhibit the canonical
a-helix signature, with a double minimum around 208 and 222 nm, with the exception
of the proline containing P5 peptide. The deconvolution of the CD spectra using
DICHROWEB allowed estimating the helical population for each peptide, which is
reported in Table 1. Overall, an excellent agreement was observed between the
AGADIR-computed values and the experimental helical population inferred from CD
data. The native hACE2 H1 helix sequence (peptides P1, Ppen) has a weak propensity
to fold into an a-helix in aqueous solution (below 10%). In contrast, sequence
optimization lead to H1 analogs exhibiting a high helical propensity (between 50 and
80%). The introduction of a proline residue in peptide P5 has a strong destabilizing
effect on helical conformation (17%) whereas L/hY substitution only led to a slight
decrease of helical content (P7 versus P6 and P10 versus P8).

Peptide mimics of hACE2 show high anti-infective efficacy and are devoid of cell
toxicity
To determine whether our peptide mimics of hACE2 H1 helix block SARSCoV2 cell infection, antiviral assays25 were performed on VeroE6 cell line (ATCC CRL1586) (Figure 3) with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate obtained from Bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) of a symptomatic infected patient (#SARS-CoV-2/PSL2020) at PitiéSalpêtrière hospital, Paris (France) (See M). We first measured inhibition of viral
replication in VeroE6 cell cultures exposed to 10 µM of the first set of peptide mimics
(P2 to P8, P1, P1scr and Ppen being used as controls), for 48h (Figure 3A). These
preliminary assays helped us to identify two peptide mimics that stand out (P7 and P8)
for their ability to block the viral infection, highlighting a potential role of homotyrosine
(Y). This observation helped us in the peptide mimics structure optimization process.
Two new peptides were designed, P9 and P10 incorporating the hTyr residue and
evaluated with P8 for their ability to block viral infection on VeroE6 cells through the
measurement of infectious virus production and viral genome.26 In order to get insight
on their ability to block viral infection on human pulmonary cells, Calu3 cell line (ATCC
HTB55) was chosen. This pulmonary epithelial cell line acts as respiratory models in
preclinical applications27 on which SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently.28
We first observed a dose-dependent reduction in virus titer (Figure 3B) and then
calculated average median inhibitory concentration (IC50) on VeroE6 and Calu3 cells
for P8, P9 and P10, with respectively (IC50) of 800 nM, 300 nM and 60 nM (Figure 3C)
and 94 nM, 76 nM and 84 nM (Figure 3D). Importantly, no cytotoxicity was observed
in similarly treated uninfected culture cells at 10 µM (concentration more than 150
times higher than IC50 for the most potent peptide mimics, Figure 3E and 3F and SI).
Collectively, these data demonstrate the high antiviral potency of peptide analogs P9
and P10.

P1scr and Ppen as controls)) at 10 µM for 2 hr, after which the virus was removed and cultures were
washed, incubated for 48 h, before supernatant was collected to measure virus replication by Elisa.
Data are combined from 3 to 6 independent experiments and expressed as compared to untreated
SARS CoV-2-infected Vero cells. The black line is at the median. B. SARS-CoV-2 titer reduction. Vero
cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2/PSL2020 P2 stock in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 0.5 in the presence of different concentration (from 0.01 to 10 µM) of peptides P8, P9 and P10 for 2
hr, after which the virus was removed, and cultures were washed in, incubated for 72 h to measure virus
production by plaque assay. C and D. Concentration dose-responses. VeroE6 cells (3C) and Calu3 cells
(3D) were infected with SARS-CoV-2/PSL2020 P2 stock at respectively a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 0.1 and 0.3 in the presence of different concentration (from 0.01 to 10 µM) of peptides P1, P1 scr,
P7, P8, P9, P10, for 2 hr, after which the virus was removed, and cultures were washed in, incubated
for 48 h, before supernatant was collected to measure virus replication by Elisa. Data are combined
from 3 to 6 independent experiments and expressed as percent of inhibition compared to untreated
SARS CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Dotted line at 50 % inhibition served to the measure of the IC50. E and
F. Cell viabilities of VeroE6 cells (3E) and Calu3 cells (3F) were measured by MTT assays after
treatment with vehicle 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 µM of P8, P9 or P10 for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cell death was measured
by flow cytometry using annexin-V-APC and PI staining in CALU-3 or Vero-E6 cells treated with vehicle
or 10 µM P8, P9 or P10 for 24, 48, or 72 h. The plots represent the means (+-SD) of three independent
experiments.

The designed peptides bind to SARSCoV-2 spike RBD with high affinity
Finally, the peptides able to block the cell infection with IC50 in the nM-sub µM
range (P8, P9 and P10) were evaluated for their ability to bind to SARSCoV-2 spike
RBD (Figure 4) using Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) with an Octet RED96e (FortéBio).29
hACE2 and P1 were used as respectively positive and negative controls.
Even though this technique presents some drawbacks and at least poor
sensitivity when the immobilized sample is a protein of high molecular weight and the
binding partners are peptides, it remained useful to identify and rank binding peptides.
Of note, only association rates could be quantified accurately, dissociation ones being
very slow, highlighting strong binding properties of some peptides. Data indicate that

8

the most efficient peptides P9 and P10 bind with estimated Kd below 1 nM, whereas
P1 does not bind to spike RBD in the conditions tested here.

The sensortip was then dipped into 100 nM hACE2 (Sanyou Biopharmaceuticals Co. Ltd, His Tag)
(Figure 4A) or 1 µM of any tested peptide (Figure 4B) to measure association before being dipped into
a well containing only running buffer to measure dissociation. Data were reference subtracted and fitted
to a 1:1 binding model using Octet Data Analysis Software v11.1 (FortéBio) and reported in table 1 as
the Kd value.

Discussion
The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is at the origin of an unprecedented
health crisis. The medical world has found itself helpless in the face of this virus, having
to deal with the absence of specific effective treatment. To date, clinically approved
vaccines or specific drugs addressing SARS-CoV-2 targets are lacking.30 Among all
possible viral targets, the virus spike protein/hACE2 interaction has been validated and
the design of compounds able to block this interaction upon binding to spike protein is
a promising approach. However, developing a specific drug at a pandemic speed is a
hard task and this specific drug cannot be a small molecule. Indeed, beyond the time
required for the identification and validation of a lead compound after a library
screening, followed by structure-activity relationship studies and clinical development,
small molecule drugs are associated with a high attrition rate partly due to their offtarget toxicity observed during pharmacological studies.
Peptides appear here as a possible solution for design and development at
pandemic speed. Peptides are widely recognized as promising therapeutic agents for
the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, and metabolic, infectious, or
cardiovascular diseases31,32 Across the world and to date, about 70 peptide drugs have
reached the market and 150 are currently under clinical development.28,29 Special
advantages that peptides show over other drugs include their high versatility, targetspecificity, lower toxicity, and ability to act on a wide variety of targets33 which are
9

directly responsible for greater success rate than small molecules (approval rate of
around 20% versus 10%)34,35. The syntheses and the development of long therapeutic
peptides (over 30 residues) are no more a challenge, as highlighted by the success
story of many GLP-1 analogs.36 Their possible antigenicity can be evaluated using
prediction tools in the design.37
Of course, even for peptides, the development of a drug at a pandemic speed
requires some considerations. Our aim was to design a peptide with reasonable helical
folding propensity in water in order to mimic the H1 helix of hACE2 in the protein
context, considering this helical folding as a prerequisite to compete with hACE2 upon
interaction with viral spike protein. The design was realized using only natural amino
acids38 and avoiding complex tools known and validated to stabilize a-helix.39,40
Stabilizing a-helical structure of medium size peptide sequences (up to 15 residues)
using only natural amino acids is a hard but achievable task.41 Our choice was guided
by the desire to build a simple peptide easy to produce quickly on a large scale, without
technical constraints requiring sometimes laborious development. We also assumed
that the use of mostly natural amino acids can facilitate the essential stages of the
development of therapeutic tools in the event of success, particularly around
pharmacokinetics, pre-clinical and clinical toxicity aspects. This seems to us to be a
fair compromise between designing a-helix peptide with optimized binding affinity and
developing an effective tool within short deadlines by integrating the constraints of
developability.
Using a combination of validated methods, we improved the helical folding
propensity of the native a-helix extracted from the protein context, thanks to leucine
and alanine scanning (See tables 1, S1 and S2), designing and synthesizing a first set
of peptides (P1 to P8). These peptides demonstrated to have a high helical content
(up to 80% for P6). However, increasing this helical content to maximum level led to
increasing mean hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment (see Table S4) that proved
to be detrimental to solubility and efficacy. The substitution of a leucine residue by the
homoTyrosine residue led to peptide analogue P7 with a slight increase in solubility
and a weak efficiency to block SARS-CoV-2 cell infection (IC50=7 µM). In this first
generation of peptides, the 27 residue P8 peptide appeared to be highly soluble with
high helical folding propensity (70%), and an ability to block SARS-CoV-2 cell infection
at 10 µM with an IC50 of 800 nM on VeroE6 cells.
In order to improve the potency of our peptides, we designed a new set of
mimics combining the properties of peptides P7 and P8, i.e. P9 and P10. If the
Leu/hTyr substitution led to a slight decrease of experimental helical content, this was
10

at the advantage of the mean hydrophobicity (see Table S4) also highlighted by lower
HPLC retention times (see Table S3). These peptides proved to be highly efficient in
blocking SARSCoV-2 cell infection (100% efficacy at 1 µM) on VeroE6 cells together
on pulmonary cells with IC50 in the nM ranges. This blocking property is related to their
ability to bind to SARSCoV-2 spike RBD with affinity estimated in the sub-nanomolar
range (Tables 1 and S6). Finally, these peptides proved to be devoid of cell toxicity at
150 times the IC50 concentration (Figures 3E and F and SI) highlighting their
therapeutic potential.
Conclusions and perspectives
We demonstrated here the feasibility of designing hACE2 peptide mimics with
high helical folding propensity in water. The folding propensity promotes interaction
with spike RBD and blocks SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary cell infection. Devoid of cell
toxicity even at high doses, these mimics might be considered for prophylactic or
therapeutic purposes upon adequate formulation. Targeting prophylaxis first might
shorten the drug development time scale. Formulated as a sublingual tablet or oral
spray, these peptides might be aimed at blocking the infectivity of the virus in a
preventive manner. Their biodistribution would be limited to the upper airways (oral
cavity ...) and it would be degraded in the digestive tracks without any toxic residues.

Methods
1. General chemistry
13

1.1. Peptides syntheses
Peptides were produced manually synthesized from Fmoc-protected amino
acids utilizing standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods. Solid-phase
peptide syntheses were performed in polypropylene Torviq syringes (10 or 20 mL)
fitted with a polyethylene porous disk at the bottom and closed with an appropriate
piston. Solvent and soluble reagents were removed through back and forth
movements. The appropriate protected amino acids were sequentially coupled using
PyOxim/Oxyma as coupling reagents. The peptides were cleaved from the rink amide
resin with classical cleavage cocktail TFA/TIS/H2O (95:2.5:2.5). The crude products
were purified using preparative scale HPLC. The final products were characterized by
analytical LCMS. All tested compounds were TFA salts and were at least 95% pure.
The relevant peptides after CD spectra analyses were selected and produced by
Genecust France on 20mg scale.
1.2. Purification
Preparative scale purification of peptides was performed by reverse phase
HPLC on a Waters system consisting of a quaternary gradient module (Water 2535)
and a dual wavelength UV/visible absorbance detector (Waters 2489), piloted by
Empower Pro 3 software using the following columns: preparative Macherey- Nagel
column (Nucleodur HTec, C18, 250 mm × 16 mm i.d., 5 μm, 110 Å) and preparative
Higgins analytical column (Proto 200, C18, 150 mm × 20 mm i.d., 5 μm, 200 Å) at a
flow rate of 14 mL/min and 20 mL/min, respectively. Small-scale crudes (<30 mg) were
purified using semipreparative Ace column (Ace 5, C18, 250 mm × 10 mm i.d., 5 μm,
300 Å) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. Purification gradients were chosen to get a ramp of
approximately 1% solution B per minute in the interest area, and UV detection was
done at 220 and 280 nm. Peptide fractions from purification were analyzed by LC−MS
(method A or B depending of retention time) or by analytical HPLC on a Dionex system
consisting of an automated LC system (Ultimate 3000) equipped with an autosampler,
a pump block composed of two ternary gradient pumps, and a dual wavelength
detector, piloted by Chromeleon software. All LC−MS or HPLC analyses were
performed on C18 columns. The pure fractions were gathered according to their purity
and then freeze-dried using an Alpha 2/4 freeze-dryer from Bioblock Scientific to get
the expected peptide as a white powder. Final peptide purity (>95%) of the
corresponding pooled fractions was checked by LC−MS using method A.
1.3. Analytics
Two methods were conducted for LC−MS
analysis.
14

Method A. Analytical HPLC was conducted on a X-Select CSH C18 XP column (30
mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 2.5 μm), eluting with 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B), using the following elution gradient: 0−3.2 min,
0−50% B; 3.2−4 min, 100% B. Flow rate was 1.8 mL/min at 40 °C. The mass spectra
(MS) were recorded on a Waters ZQ mass spectrometer using electrospray positive
ionization [ES+ to give (MH)+ molecular ions] or electrospray negative ionization [ES−
to give (MH)− molecular ions] modes. The cone voltage was 20 V.
Method B. Analytical HPLC was conducted on a X-Select CSH C18 XP column (30
mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 2.5 μm), eluting with 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B), using the following elution gradient: 0−3.2 min,
5−100% B; 3.2−4 min, 100% B. Flow rate was 1.8 mL/min at 40 °C. The mass spectra
(MS) were recorded on a Waters ZQ mass spectrometer using electrospray positive
ionization [ES+ to give (MH)+ molecular ions] or electrospray negative ionization [ES−
to give (MH)− molecular ions] modes. The cone voltage was 20 V.
2. CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-815 CD spectropolarimeter equipped
with a Peltier temperature controller. Data were obtained at 25°C over a wavelength
range between 185 and 270 nm, using a wavelength interval of 0.2 nm and a scan rate
of 20 nm/min. Peptide samples were prepared at a concentration of 60 µM in 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a quartz cell of 1 mm path length. CD experiments
were processed and plotted with R program. CD spectra were analyzed using
DICHROWEB web server and CDSSTR deconvolution algorithm.24
3.Anti-infectivity study on Vero-E625 and Calu3 cells
3.1. Cells and virus preparation.
VeroE6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and Calu3 (ATCC HTB55) cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with non-essential amino
acids (NEAA), penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS).
SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate was obtained from Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of a
symptomatic infected patient (#SARS-CoV-2/PSL2020) at Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital,
Paris (France). BAL (0.5 mL) was mixed with an equal volume of DMEM without FBS,
supplemented with 25mM Hepes, double concentration of P/S and miconazole
(Sigma), and added to 80% confluent Vero-E6 cells monolayer seeded into a 25 cm

2

tissue culture flask. After 1 h adsorption at 37°C, 3 mL of infectious media (DMEM
supplemented with 2% FBS, P/S and miconazole) were added. Twenty-four hours
15

post-infection another 2 mL of infectious media were added. Five days post-infection,
supernatants were collected, aliquoted and stored at -80°C (P1). For secondary virus
2

stock, Vero-E6 cells seeded into 25 cm tissue culture flasks were infected with 0.5 mL
of P1 stored aliquot, and cell-culture supernatant were collected 48 h post-infection,
and stored at -80°C (P2). Infectious viral particles were measured by a standard plaque
assay previously described with fixation of cells 72 hr post infection, as described
(Mendoza et al, 2020). Accordingly, the viral titer of SARS-CoV-2/PSL2020 P2 stock
is about 5.3 105 PFU/mL.
3.2. Experiments of peptide-neutralization.
VeroE6 or Calu3 (1 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded into 24 wells plates in infectious
media and treated with different concentrations of the peptides (from 0.1 to 10 µM).
After 30 min at room temperature, cells were infected with 0.1 moi (VeroE6) or 0.3 moi
(Calu3) of SRAS-Cov2 (SARS-CoV-2/PSL2020 P2 stock) in infectious media. All
conditions were tested in triplicate.
Cell supernatants were collected at 48 h post-infection for Elisa assay using SARSCoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Nucleoprotein / NP ELISA Kit from Sino biological, according the
manufacturer’s instruction, and standard plaque assay.
4.Toxicity study on Vero-E6 cells and Calu3
Cell viability was measured by MTT assays after treatment with 0, 0.1, 1.0 or 10 µM of
the indicated peptide for 24, 48, or 72 h.
Methodology: 96-well plates were used to seed 104 CALU-3 or Vero-E6 cells per well,
which were let to adhere. Vero-E6 cells reached ~50% confluency the day after, while
CALU-3 did it after 48 h. When this was reached, the medium in the wells was replaced
and cells were either left alone (0 µM) or treated with 0.1 µM, 1 µM or 10 µM of the
corresponding peptide. MTT (2 mM) was added to each well after 24 h, 48 h or 72 h of
treatment and incubated 4 h in a controlled, humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37
ºC. Supernatant in each well was discarded from the wells using a vacum pump and
formazan salts were disolved in 100 µL DMSO to read plate absorbance at 570 nM.
Absorbance in each well was normalized with untreated controls. The plots represent
the means (± SD) of an experiment performed in triplicates
5-Biolayer Interferometry experiments
Fc-tagged 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 (Sanyou Biopharmaceuticals Co. Ltd) was
immobilized to an anti-human capture (AHC) sensortip (FortéBio) using an Octet
16

RED96e (FortéBio). The sensortip was then dipped into 100 nM hACE2 (Sanyou
Biopharmaceuticals Co. Ltd, His Tag) or 1 µM of any tested peptide to measure
association before being dipped into a well containing only running buffer composed
of DPBS (Potassium Chloride 2.6mM, Potassium Phosphate monobasic 1.5mM,
Sodium Chloride 138mM, Sodium Phosphate dibasic 8mM), 0.05% Tween 20 and
0.5% bovine serum albumin to measure dissociation.
Data were reference subtracted and fit to a 1:1 binding model using Octet Data
Analysis Software v11.1 (FortéBio) and reported on figure 4.
