Abstract

2

Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) are generally triggered by stress-induced

3

translation arrest for storing mRNAs. Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-

4

viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of

5

innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA virus, coronavirus, mutates

6

frequently and circulates among animals, imposing great threat to public safety and

7

animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infections is largely

8

unknown. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s

9

and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provide

10

evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation

11

via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we

12

observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately

13

80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat

14

shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We show that the intrinsic endoribonuclease

15

activity of nsp15 is responsible for the inhibition of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-

16

defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs,

17

along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV

18

failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A triggered

19

transcription of IFN-β which in turn greatly affected recombinant virus replication.

20

Further analysis showed that SGs function as antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the

21

attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells.

22

Additional evidence includes the aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to

23

the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease

24

nsp15 of IBV suppresses the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the

25

accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually

26

ensuring productive virus replication. We speculate that coronaviruses employ similar

27

mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation for efficient virus

28

replication, as the endoribonuclease function of nsp15 is conserved in all coronaviruses.

Author summary

31

It has been reported that stress granules (SGs) are part of the host cell antiviral

32

response. Not surprisingly, viruses in turn produce an array of antagonists to counteract

33

such host response. Here, we show that IBV inhibits the formation of SGs through its

34

endoribonuclease nsp15, by reducing the accumulation of viral dsRNA, evading the

35

activation of PKR, and by subsequently inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation and SGs

36

formation. Nsp15 also inhibits SG formation independent of the eIF2α pathway,

37

probably by targeting host mRNA. Depletion of SG scaffold proteins decreases IRF3-

38

IFN response and increases the production of IBV. All coronaviruses encode a

39

conserved endoribonuclease nsp15, and it will be important to determine whether also

40

other (non-avian) coronaviruses limit the formation of anti-viral SGs in a similar

41

manner.

42

Introduction

43

RNA viruses must generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in order to replicate

44

their genome. Host cells consequently employ a variety of pattern recognition (PRRs)

45

receptors to detect dsRNA and trigger innate antiviral responses, which play a pivotal

46

and critical role in fighting viral infections [1]. The host dsRNA-activated protein

47

kinase R (PKR) is a key element of innate antiviral defenses [2]. Following binding to

48

dsRNA, PKR undergoes auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylates the alpha subunit of

49

eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2α) on serine 51 [2, 3]. Phospho-eIF2α tightly binds to

50

eIF2β, prevents the recycling of ternary complex tRNAMet-GTP-eIF2, and inhibits 43S

51

translation complex formation, leading to global translation shut off, severely impairing

52

virus replication [4]. In addition to PKR, there are three other eIF2α kinases involved

53

in translation inhibition: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), general

54

control nonderepressible protein 2 (GCN2), and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI),

55

which senses unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nutrient

56

starvation/UV[5, 6], and oxidative stress, respectively [7-9]. The translation inhibition

57

leads to polysome disassembly and the subsequent assembly of stress granules (SGs),

58

a membrane-less, highly dynamic warehouse for storing mRNA and translation

59

components [10]. SGs assembly is driven by aggregation-prone cellular RNA-binding

60

proteins: Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T cell-restricted

61

intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), and TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) [11-13] . Meanwhile,

62

the post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, poly (ADP)-ribosylation,

63

O-linked N-acetyl glucosamination, phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation, regulate

64

the SGs formation by modifying the components of SGs [14, 15]. Once stress is relieved

65

and translation activities are restored, SGs are disassembled and mRNAs rapidly

66

resume translation [16].

67

In addition to PKR, there are other two groups of PRRs to recognize dsRNA,

68

namely Toll like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) [17, 18]. One of the

69

TLRs, TLR3, located on the endosomal membrane, senses dsRNA and single stranded

70

RNA (ssRNA) generated by RNA virus or DNA virus. This in turn activates either the

71

NF-κB or IRF3/7 pathway, resulting in boosting the production of proinflammatory

72

cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) [19]. Another group of essential PRRs, RLRs,

73

composed of RIG-I and MDA5, ubiquitously exist in the cytoplasm of mammal cells,

74

recognize 5’-pppRNA and long dsRNA derived from RNA virus, respectively.

75

Activation of RLRs by viral RNA leads to the aggregation of MAVS and recruitment

76

of a series of signaling intermediates, transmits the signaling to transcription factor

77

IRF3, IRF7, or NF-κB, eventually promoting the transcription of proinflammatory

78

cytokines and type I IFN [20-22]. Consequently, the secretion of type I IFN stimulates

79

the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the JAK-STAT pathway, which

80

protect neighboring cells from virus infection [23].

81

Recent evidence has shown that PKR and RLRs are localized to SGs during virus

82

infection [24]. It is proposed that SGs exert speciﬁc antiviral activities by providing a

83

platform for interaction between antiviral proteins and non-self RNA. To accomplish

84

efﬁcient replication, some viruses have evolved various mechanisms to circumvent the

85

formation of anti-viral SGs. For instance, Influenza A Virus (IAV) NS1 protein and

86

Vaccinia virus E3L sequester dsRNA from PKR [25, 26], Ebola virus sequesters SG

87

core proteins to viral inclusion body, thereby inhibiting the formation of SGs [27]. For

88

some picornaviruses, leader protease and 3C protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus

89

(FMDV) and 2A protease of Enterovirus 71, disassemble the SGs by cleaving G3BP1

90

or G3BP2 [28-31]. As for coronaviruses, recent studies show that middle east

91

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 4a accessory protein limits the

92

activation of PKR by binding to dsRNA, thereby inhibiting the formation of SGs and

93

ensuring viral protein translation and efﬁcient virus replication [32, 33]. Mouse

94

hepatitis virus (MHV) replication induces host translational shutoff and mRNA decay,

95

with concomitant formation of stress granules and processing bodies [34]. Porcine

96

transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced SG like granules correlated with

97

viral replication and transcription [35]. Several SG proteins (including caprin and G3BP)

98

have been reported to be associated with IBV-N protein [36]. A recent report shows

99

that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection results in the formation of SGs in

100

approximately 20% of infected cells and inhibits eIF2α-dependent/eIF2α-independent

101

SG formation by unknown mechanisms [37].

102

Coronaviruses harbor the largest positive-stranded RNA genome among the RNA

103

viruses, with size from 27 kb to 32 kb. The two-third of the 5’ terminus encodes

104

replicase polyproteins (1a and 1ab), while one-third of the 3’ terminus encodes spike

105

protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and

106

accessory proteins. The proteolysis of overlapped polyproteins is processed by two self-

107

encoded proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), into

108

15-16 mature non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16). Most of the nsps assemble into a

109

replication and transcription complex (RTC) responsible for virus replication, while

110

several nsps mediate the evasion of host innate immune responses. For example, severe

111

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV nsp1 suppresses

112

host gene expression by mediating host mRNA degradation [38]; the PLpro nsp3 of

113

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV harbors deubiquitinase activity and interferes with type I

114

IFN responses [39, 40]; feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FCoV) and porcine

115

deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) nsp5 inhibits type I IFN response by cleaving NEMO [41,

42]; porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp16 restricts IFN production and

117

facilitate virus replication [43]; MHV nsp15 endonuclease activity is key to evade

118

double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing by host sensors and ensures efficient

119

coronavirus replication [44].

120

IBV is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and infects avian species [45]. It

121

causes a prevalent disease that has led to substantial economic losses in poultry farm

122

for many decades. Elucidating host responses to IBV infection is fundamental to

123

understand virus replication and identify targets for therapeutic control. In this study,

124

we infected three types of cells with IBV, and found that approximately 80% of infected

125

cells did not display SGs formation. IBV also hindered SGs formation triggered by

126

different canonical stress stimuli. Further analysis showed that IBV nsp15 was involved

127

in the inhibition of SG formation, and that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15

128

particularly played a pivotal role. Compared to wild type IBV, infection with the nsp15

129

endoribonuclease catalytic mutant, rIBV-nsp15-H238A, led to accumulation of higher

130

levels of dsRNA, activation of PKR, and formation SGs, concomitantly with a higher

131

production of IFN-β and lower viral replication. We further demonstrate that SGs play

132

an anti-viral role by using SG-defective cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report

133

describing the role of coronavirus nsp15 in the suppression of integral stress response

134

as well as innate antiviral response.

Results

137

IBV prevents SGs formation in the majority of infected cells

138

In this study, we employed chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells in most experiments; in

139

specific cases, to facilitate the detection of cellular proteins, and due to the

140

unavailability of antibodies against chicken proteins of interest (see Table 1), we also

141

included mammalian H1299 and Vero cells lines, which also support replication of the

142

IBV-Beaudette strain. To determine whether IBV replication induces SGs formation,

143

H1299, Vero, and DF-1 cells were infected with IBV-Beaudette strain at MOI=1. The

144

occurrence of SGs was assessed by visualizing G3BP1 granules formation while IBV

145

infection was monitored by visualizing the N protein. We determined the kinetics of

146

SGs formation upon infection at 4 hours intervals, by counting the cells with IBV-N

147

protein expression and by calculating the proportion of these that was also positive for

148

G3BP1 granules. In all the three cell types, despite efficient virus infection, as indicated

149

by the expression of N protein and syncytia formation, no SGs formation could be

150

detected from 0 to 8 hours post-infection (h.p.i.), whereas from 12 to 24 h.p.i., G3BP1

151

granules could be detected, but only in approximately 5%-25% of infected cells (Fig

152

1A-C). These observations indicate that IBV effectively suppresses SGs formation, and

153

that the inhibition mechanisms employed are not restricted to a specific cell type. In

154

SGs positive cells, another SGs marker, TIAR, was found to colocalize with G3BP1

155

granules, altogether demonstrating that IBV induces canonical SGs (Fig 1D-E). Due to

156

the lack of antibodies specific for chicken TIAR and lack of cross-reactivity of the anti-

157

human TIAR to chicken TIAR, we displayed the colocalization of TIAR with G3BP1

158

in Vero and H1299 cells.

159
160

Phosphorylation status of PKR and eIF2α during IBV infection

161

Although SGs can be generally induced through eIF2α-dependent or -independent

162

pathways, during viral infections SGs are mainly induced via the PKR-eIF2α pathway.

163

Several past studies demonstrate that some viruses impede SGs formation by

164

preventing the activation of PKR, or by cleaving the SG scaffold protein G3BP1 [46,

165

47]. To elucidate the inhibition mechanism of SG formation by IBV, we investigated

166

whether IBV interfered with the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α or directly affected

167

TIA-1 and G3BP1 protein levels. After having assessed that IBV prevents SGs

168

formation not only in chicken cells but also in two different mammalian cell lines, due

169

to the availability of antibodies directed against mammalian proteins and their lack of

170

cross-reactivity to the chicken proteins of interest, we next proceeded with H1299 and

171

Vero cells. In IBV-infected H1299 cells, PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation was

172

comparable to that observed in mock infected cells (Fig 2A). In Vero cells, however,

173

PKR, but not eIF2α, phosphorylation was slightly increased at 20 and 24 h.p.i. (Fig 2B),

174

altogether suggesting that the PKR-eIF2α-SGs pathway is not obviously triggered by

175

IBV infection. In parallel, we did not observe any cleavage product of either G3BP1 or

176

TIA-1 throughout IBV infection in both H1299 and Vero cells (Fig 2), altogether

177

indicating that IBV may avoid PKR activation to prevent SGs formation.

178
179

IBV blocks both eIF2α-dependent and -independent SGs formation

180

During the course of our study, it was reported that IBV inhibits eIF2α-dependent

181

and -independent SGs induction in Vero cells [37] . Here, we used H1299 and DF-1

182

cells to further investigate the inhibition of SGs by IBV. H1299 and DF-1 cells were

183

infected with IBV and treated with three different stress stimuli (sodium arsenite, heat

184

shock and NaCl) to induce canonical SGs formation. Sodium arsenite or heat shock

185

promotes phosphorylation of eIF2α in an HRI kinase-dependent manner, leading to

186

translational arrest and subsequent formation of SGs [48], whereas NaCl may enhance

187

the local concentration of mRNAs and cellular proteins by decreasing the cell volume,

188

thereby inducing SGs in an eIF2α-independent manner [49]. In non-infected cells, more

189

than 90% of cells were positive for SGs formation after treatment with these stress

190

stimuli; interestingly, IBV infection prevented SGs formation triggered by these stimuli,

191

as evidenced by the absence of G3BP1 granules exclusively in IBV-positive cells (Fig

192

3A-C). These results indicate that IBV infection blocks both eIF2α-dependent and

193

independent SGs formation in both, mammalian and avian cells. Sodium arsenite

194

treatment inefficiently triggered G3BP1 aggregation in DF-1 cells due to unknown

195

reasons (data not shown). We next explored whether IBV interfered with the

196

phosphorylation of eIF2α triggered by sodium arsenite or heat shock. We observed a

197

significant upregulation of phospho-eIF2α by sodium arsenite or heat shock treatment

198

in H1299 cells; however, there was no reduction of phospho-eIF2α by IBV infection

199

(Fig 3D-E). Collectively, these data indicate that IBV infection restricts both eIF2α-

200

dependent and -independent SG formation, probably by interfering with SG assembly

201

or disassembly and not with direct eIF2α phosphorylation.

203
204

Endoribonuclease nsp15 is responsible for inhibition of SG formation

205

To screen the IBV proteins involved in the suppression of SGs formation, we

206

expressed individual Flag-tagged IBV protein in H1299 cells and triggered the

207

formation of SGs with heat shock. The schematic diagram of proteins encoded by IBV

208

was shown in Fig. 4A. In cells expressing nsp2, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9,

209

nsp12, nsp16, 3b, E, 5a, 5b, M, or N, SGs formation remained intact (Fig 4B),

210

suggesting that alone these proteins have no inhibitory effect on the formation of SGs.

211

Interestingly, only in nsp15-expressing cells, the heat shock-induced SGs were absent

212

(as indicated by white arrow), suggesting that nsp15 may be the viral protein

213

responsible for efficient suppression of SGs formation. We also investigated, but failed

214

to detect, the expression of nsp3, nsp10, nsp13, nsp14, S, and 3a, therefore it cannot be

215

excluded that also these viral proteins might be involved in inhibition of SG formation.

216

These results however demonstrate that nsp15 alone is sufficient to block SGs

217

formation.

218

Nsp15 is a conserved endoribonuclease of coronaviruses. It has been reported that

219

its activity is involved in evasion of dsRNA sensing and interference with the type I

220

IFN response [44, 50]. The conserved histidine (H) 223 and H238 of IBV nsp15 are

221

critical for the endoribonuclease activity [51]. To examine whether the

222

endoribonuclease activity is involved in the inhibition of SGs formation, we introduced

223

an alanine (A) substitution in the catalytic core residues H223 or H238, to abrogate the

224

catalytic activity. We next compared the ability of wild type nsp15 and mutant nsp15-

225

H223A or nsp15-H238A to prevent SGs formation in H1299 cells. As expected, wild

226

type nsp15 blocked the formation of SGs induced by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or

227

NaCl (indicated with white arrow), while nsp15-H223A and nsp15-H238A did not (Fig

228

5A-C). Thus, the nsp15 endoribonuclease activity is required for the suppression of

229

eIF2α-dependent and -independent SGs formation.

230

In a preliminary investigation of how nsp15 may prevent SG formation, we

231

examined whether nsp15 interferes with the phosphorylation of eIF2α. We observed a

232

significant increase of phospho-eIF2α by sodium arsenite or heat shock treatment (Fig

233

3D-E); however, in agreement with the Fig 3D-E data on IBV-infected cells, no

234

reduction of phospho-eIF2α was observed in nsp15-expressing cells (Fig 5D). No

235

difference was observed also in the protein levels of G3BP1 and TIA-1 in nsp15-

236

expressing cells, compared to control cells. Taken together, these data indicate that

237

nsp15 interferes with the formation of SGs downstream of eIF2α.

238
239

Nsp15-defective rIBV-nsp15-H238A induces canonical SGs by accumulation of

240

dsRNA and activation of PKR

241

To further confirm the involvement of the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 in

242

the disruption of SGs formation, we constructed nsp15-defective recombinant virus

243

rIBV-nsp15-H238A in which the nsp15 catalytic site H238 was replaced with an

244

alanine (Fig 6A). We also constructed, but failed to recover nsp15-defective rIBV-

245

nsp15-H223A, possibly due to the effect of the disruption of the catalytic site on virus

246

replication. We compared the ability of wild type IBV and rIBV-nsp15-H238A to

247

induce the formation of SGs in H1299 and DF-1 cells. At 20 h.p.i., only 18% of H1299

248

cells and 17% of DF-1 cells infected with wild type IBV showed the presence of SGs,

249

whereas approximately 78% of the H1299 cells and 75% of DF-1 cells infected with

250

rIBV-nsp15-H238A showed SGs formation (Fig 6B). Treatment with cycloheximide

251

(CHX), a chemical which disassembles bona ﬁde SGs, dissolved the rIBV-nsp15-

252

H238A-induced G3BP1 and G3BP2 granules (Fig 6C), confirming that rIBV-nsp15-

253

H238A induces canonical SGs.

In

agreement,

rIBV-nsp15-H238A

256

7A). Thus, nsp15 endoribonuclease activity is involved in antagonizing PKR activation,

257

the well characterized dsRNA sensor and IFN-β inducer. We noted that the replication

258

of rIBV-nsp15-H238A was impaired, as evidenced by the decreased level of IBV-S,

259

IBV-M, and IBV-N protein synthesis, compared to wild type IBV (Fig 7A). Moreover,

260

although rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication was low, it significantly stimulated the

261

transcription of IFN-β at 20 h.p.i., which was approximately 25-fold higher than that

262

induced by wild type IBV in H1299 cells (Fig 7B, left panel), and approximately 380-

263

fold higher than that by wild type IBV in DF-1 cells (Fig 7B, right panel). Taken

264

together, the activation of PKR by rIBV-nsp15-H238A and associated induction of type

265

I IFN might be responsible for the lower replication of this recombinant virus.

266

The activation of PKR by rIBV-nsp15-H238A prompted us to measure and

267

compare the levels of dsRNA during infection by using the specific J2 monoclonal

268

antibody, which binds dsRNA greater than 40 nucleotides in length [51] and was

269

previously successfully used during IBV infection in chicken cells [52].

270

Immunofluorescence analysis at 20 h.p.i., revealed evident accumulation of dsRNA in

271

rIBV-nsp15-H238A infected H1299 cells, compared to wild type IBV infected cells

272

(Fig 7C). The dsRNA produced by rIBV-nsp15-H238A however, did not colocalized

273

with G3BP1 granules, suggesting the dsRNA is not recruited to SGs (Fig 7C). In DF-1

274

cells, we also observed higher levels of dsRNA accumulation during infection with

275

rIBV-nsp15-H238A than with wild type IBV (Fig 7D). dsRNA dot blot analysis also

276

supported the observation that infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A leads to higher

277

accumulation of dsRNA than with wild type IBV (data not shown). Although the

278

dsRNA in wild type IBV infected cells partially co-localized with IBV-N, the dsRNA

279

produced by rIBV-nsp15-H238A did not co-localize well with IBV-N (Fig 7C-D). We

280

speculate that when compared to wild type IBV, rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication leads

281

to higher accumulation of dsRNA and that the excess dsRNA may escape from

282

replication-transcription complex (RTC). The “free” dsRNA in turn, triggers the

283

activation of PKR and phosphorylation of eIF2α, results in translational shut off,

284

eventually promoting the formation of SGs and activation of the type I IFN response.

285

RT-PCR examination of the level of viral RNA showed that rIBV-nsp15-H238A indeed

286

increases the ratio of negative strand RNA : positive strand RNA, compared to wild

287

type IBV (supplementary Fig S2), suggesting the functional nsp15 is required for

288

maintaining the ratio of viral (-:+) RNA. Altogether, these data indicate that intact

289

nsp15 endoribonuclease activity acts to reduce the intracellular levels of dsRNA,

thereby preventing activation of PKR and SGs formation.

291
292

Nsp15-defective rIBV-nsp15-H238A strongly activates the IRF3-IFN signaling via

293

the formation of SG

294

To examine the role of SGs in IBV infection, we knocked out the SGs core protein

295

G3BP1 and G3BP2 in H1299 cells by a CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Depletion of G3BP1/2

296

resulted in the absence of SGs during sodium arsenite stimulation and rIBV-nsp15-

297

H238A infection (Fig 8A). In G3BP1/2 knock out cells, the levels of phospho-TBK1

298

and phospho-IRF3 triggered by rIBV-nsp15-H238A infection were greatly decreased

299

(Fig 8B); consequently, the transcription of IFN-β and ISG IFIT1 induced by rIBV-

300

nsp15-H238A infection were decreased (Fig 8C). These results suggest that the

301

formation of SGs is necessary to elicit IRF3-IFN signaling in response to rIBV-nsp15-

302

H238A infection. It was worth noting that rIBV-nsp15-H238A infection did not

303

significantly stimulate p65 phosphorylation, and knock out of G3BP1/2 had no obvious

304

effect on phospho-p65 levels (Fig 8B); thus, SGs formation is not involved in NF-κB

305

signaling during IBV infection. Interestingly, upon G3BP1/2 knock out, we observed

306

higher levels of IBV-S, IBV-M, and IBV-N (Fig 8B) and in agreement, more infectious

307

progeny virus particles were produced, as evidenced by TCID50 assay (Fig 8D). This is

308

in line with our previous suggestion that activation of the type I IFN signaling might be

309

the factor limiting rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication; failure to trigger an IFN-β response

310

in G3BP1/2 knock out cells however, promotes virus replication even in the absence of

311

nsp15 endoribonuclease activity.

312

To investigate whether the involvement of SGs in IRF3-IFN signaling is restricted

313

to specific virus infections, we examined the IRF3-IFN signaling upon poly I:C

314

stimulation. Results showed that in G3BP1/2 positive cells, poly I:C strongly stimulated

315

phosphorylation of IRF3 and to a lesser extent of TBK1 (Fig 9A), and promoted IRF3

316

nuclear translocation (Fig 9B, 34% of total cells display nuclear IRF3); however, in the

317

absence of G3BP1/2, poly I:C stimulation led to reduced TBK1 phosphorylation, and

318

to a greater extent, to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig 9A), as well as less IRF3

319

nuclear translation (Fig 9B, 9% of total cells with nuclear IRF3). As a consequence,

320

transcription of IFN-β and IFIT-1 was significantly decreased upon poly I:C stimulation

321

of G3BP1/2 knock out cells (Fig 9C). Altogether, these results demonstrate that SGs

322

positively regulates IRF3-IFN signaling and that such a mechanism is not restricted to

323

a specific virus infection.

324
325

Aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to SGs during IBV infection

326

A previous report showed that the dsRNA sensors PKR, MDA5, and RIG-I are

327

located to SG and sense dsRNA [24]. In this study, we examined the subcellular

328

localization of PRRs and signaling intermediates during IBV infection. In the small

329

proportion of IBV-infected cells that displayed the presence of SGs, PKR, MDA5,

330

TLR3 and MAVS aggregated and colocalized with G3BP1 granules (Fig 10A). These

331

results demonstrate that SGs indeed recruit PRRs and their signaling intermediates

332

during IBV infection. We further examined the subcellular location of signaling

333

intermediates, results showed that TRAF3, TRAF6, TBK1, and IKKε all aggregated to

334

G3BP1 granules (Fig 10B). These data, combined with the positive role on IRF3-IFN

335

signaling, demonstrate that SGs may function as a platform for PRRs and downstream

336

signaling intermediates.

Discussion

339

SGs formation or inhibition has been reported for different groups of

340

coronaviruses: MHV and TGEV induce SGs or SG-like granules [34, 35], whereas

341

MERS-CoV does not [32, 33], and IBV was reported to induce SGs formation but only

342

in 20% of infected Vero cells [37], yet the biological significance of SGs in coronavirus

343

replication is unclear. In this study, we report that IBV indeed induces SGs formation

344

in a small proportion of infected cells and it does so not only in mammalian (H1299

345

and Vero) cells, but also in chicken DF-1 cells. Furthermore, consistent with previous

346

reports [53], also in our study we found that IBV inhibits both eIF2α-dependent (heat

347

shock, sodium arsenite) and -independent (NaCl) SGs formation. We also assessed SGs

348

formation by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, only 10%-20% of

349

PEDV-infected Vero cells were SGs positive (data not shown). Combined with the

350

inhibition of SGs formation by MERS-CoV [33], our results suggest that the inhibition

351

of SG formation by coronavirus might be a universal phenomenon, not only restricted

352

to a specific coronavirus. Screening of viral proteins involved in inhibition of SGs

353

formation, revealed that nsp15 is a specific stress response antagonist: overexpression

354

of nsp15 resulted in disruption of both eIF2α-dependent and -independent SGs

355

formation, which could be attributed to its endoribonuclease activity; abrogating nsp15

356

endoribonuclease function in vivo led to impaired virus replication, efficient formation

357

of SGs, accumulation of dsRNA, robust activation of PKR, and activation of IRF3-IFN

358

signaling. Thus, functional nsp15 is specifically required for efficient virus replication

359

as it plays a role in inhibition of SG formation and subsequent activation of an anti-

360

viral response.

361
362

Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the host cell

363

cytoplasm. The viral RNA synthesis is performed in RTCs that include viral and cell

364

proteins, connected with convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles [54,

365

55]. Replication of the coronavirus genome requires continuous RNA synthesis,

366

whereas transcription is a discontinuous process unique among RNA viruses.

367

Transcription includes a template switch during the synthesis of sub-genomic negative

368

strand RNAs to add a copy of the leader sequence [56-58]. The negative strand RNAs

369

is the replication intermediate of genomic RNA and of sub-genomic RNA. During the

370

replication and transcription process, positive and negative strand RNA form dsRNA.

371

It has been reported that nsp13 and cellular helicases help to unwind the dsRNA for

372

efficient replication and transcription. The amount of negative strand intermediates is

373

approximately 10% of the positive strand RNA [59]. It is believed that the proper ratio

374

of positive and negative stand RNA is important for efficient replication and

375

transcription, as well as subsequent genome packaging and mRNA translation. How do

376

coronaviruses modulate the ratio of positive and negative strand RNA? Coronavirus

377

nsp15 has uridylate-specific endoribonuclease activity on single-stranded RNA and

378

dsRNA [60, 61], is considered an integral component of the RTC and co-localizes with

379

viral RNA [62]. It has been reported that nsp15 is involved in efficient viral RNA

380

synthesis [63, 64]. Nsp15-null MHV exhibits severe replication defects in macrophages

381

and is highly attenuated in mice [44, 50]. As the negative strand RNA intermediates

382

harbor a poly (U) sequence, which is complementary to the positive strand RNA poly

383

(A) tail, we propose that nsp15 targets negative strand intermediates or dsRNA

384

intermediates within stalled RTCs that are no longer active in viral RNA synthesis. This

385

is supported by the observation that, compared to wild type IBV, infection with nsp15-

386

null virus rIBV-nsp15-H238A leads to substantial accumulation of dsRNA

387

intermediates that do not localize with RTCs and to an increased ratio of negative

388

strand:positive strand RNA . In this way, nsp15 controls viral RNA quantity for

389

efficient replication/transcription, thereby facilitating the proliferation of virus.

390

Recently, Hackbart reports that nsp15 cleaves the 5′-poly(U) from negative-sense viral

391

RNA intermediates [65], confirming our hypothesis.

392
393

Previous reports show that coronavirus nsp15 and arterivirus nsp11 act as IFN

394

antagonists [51]. Overexpression of SARS-CoV nsp15 inhibits the IFN response and

395

MAVS-mediated apoptosis [66]. Interestingly, Hackbart find that the poly(U)

396

containing negative-sense viral RNA is sufficient to stimulate MDA5, and nsp15 is

397

responsible for the cleavage of the poly(U) containing negative-sense viral RNA,

398

thereby antagonize the IFN response [65]. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized

399

role of coronavirus nsp15 in the evasion of PKR activation and interference with SGs

400

formation. RNA viruses that replicate via dsRNA intermediates can be detected as

401

“non-self” by host dsRNA sensors: PKR, RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3, eventually

402

stimulating the production of type I IFN [19, 20, 22, 67]. It is likely that dsRNAs are

403

shielded within double-membrane vesicles and replication intermediates are likely

404

protected by the RTC and N protein. In this study, by generating nsp15-defective

405

recombinant virus, we find that compared to the wild type virus, infection with rIBV-

406

nsp15-H238A leads to dsRNA accumulation, PKR activation, robust formation of SG

407

as well as up-regulation of IFN-β, which ultimately coincided with impaired rIBV-

408

nsp15-H238A replication. Therefore, IBV nsp15 acts as IFN antagonist, likely through

409

removal of dsRNA intermediates at sites of RNA synthesis, thereby efficiently evading

410

integrated stress and innate anti-viral host responses. The involvement of the viral

411

ribonuclease in degrading viral dsRNA and antagonizing IFN responses has also been

412

reported in pestivirus and Lassa virus [68-70].

413

Several reports show that SGs serve as platform for viral dsRNA sensing by RLRs

414

and subsequent activation of viral immune responses [71, 72]. Recent studies reported

415

that several other IFN regulatory molecules, such as MEX3C, Riplet, DHX36 and

416

Pumilios, also localize to SGs [73]. It is thus reasonable that viruses evolved

417

mechanisms to suppress SGs formation in order to promote their propagation. Influenza

418

A virus (IAV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is reported to be involved in subversion

419

of PKR-dependent SG formation [25]; importantly, during NS1-null IAV infection,

420

viral RNAs and nucleocapsid protein co-localize in SGs together with RIG-I, PKR and

421

SGs markers G3BP1/TIAR; knock down of the G3BP1 or PKR genes abrogated NS1-

422

null IAV-induced IFN production, concomitantly with defects in SGs formation. Here,

423

we find that wild type IBV triggers the formation of SGs only in 20% infected cells,

424

and that PRRs (PKR, MDA5, TLR3) and signaling intermediates (MAVS, TRAF3,

425

TRAF6, TBK1, IKKε) aggregate to the IBV-induced SGs. Nsp15-null recombinant

426

IBV robustly activates PKR, efficiently induces SGs formation (80% infected cells with

427

SGs formation), and strongly induced the transcription of IFN-β; but in SGs’ core

428

proteins defective cells, either by nsp15-null recombinant IBV infection or poly I:C

429

stimulation, the induction of IFN-β signaling is severely impaired. These data thus

430

further confirm that SGs play a positive regulatory role in the IRF3-IFN signaling,

431

leading to the initiation of anti-viral innate responses, and that this is not restricted to a

432

specific virus infection. These observations strongly suggest that the formation of SGs

433

is critical for virus-induced antiviral innate immunity and SGs may function as a

434

scaffold for viral RNA recognition by RLRs.

435

Virus-encoded endoribonucleases not only modulate viral RNA, but also target the

436

majority of cellular mRNAs, likely enabling viral mRNAs to better compete for limiting

437

translation components and directing the cell from host to virus gene expression.

438

Targeting host mRNA for degradation not only restricts host gene expression, but also

439

subverts SGs by depleting the core component of SG, RNA. Thus, the ribonuclease is

440

a unique strategy for viruses to subvert SGs. It has been well characterized that the

441

herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV2 employ the virion host shutoff (VHS)

442

endoribonuclease to impede the SGs formation [74, 75]. Infection with a mutant virus

443

lacking VHS (ΔVHS) results in PKR activation and PKR-dependent SGs formation in

444

multiple cell types [76, 77]. Destabilization of host mRNAs by VHS may directly

445

contribute to its disruption of SG formation [78]. In addition to be important in virus

446

replication, coronavirus nsp15 may also target host mRNA and subsequently inhibit

447

host protein translation. Interestingly, we previously showed that differently from

448

alphacoronaviruses such as MHV and SARS-CoV [79, 80], wild-type IBV affects host

449

protein synthesis leading to host-protein shut off, but without affecting mRNA stability

450

[81]. In the current study, when nsp15 was overexpressed, it was worth noting that

451

nsp15 located to nucleus (Fig 4, Fig 5A-C). Taken all our observations together, we

452

speculate that nuclear nsp15 may interfere with the host pre-mRNA processing or

453

nuclear export. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms used by
17

454

nsp15 to target to host protein expression system.

455

Altogether, there are several possibilities that may account for the lack of SGs

456

formation upon transfection of nsp15 or infection with IBV (Fig 11): (1) as SGs are

457

dynamic foci, nsp15 might be involved in the disassembly of SGs. The requirement for

458

nsp15 endoribonuclease activity for the disruption of both eIF2α-dependent or eIF2α-

459

independent SGs, implies that removal of mRNA from SGs promotes their disassembly

460

and predicts that intact RNA is crucial for maintaining the integrity of SGs; (2) during

461

IBV infection, nsp15 endoribonuclease activity may be involved in the regulation of

462

virus genomic RNA replication and sub-genomic mRNA transcription, consequently

463

functioning as a “gatekeeper” to sequester viral dsRNA within replication complexes

464

and away from host sensor PKR, resulting in absence of SG formation; (3) nsp15

465

prevents the assembly of SGs by promoting the destruction of mRNAs present in

466

polysome, free mRNA, or by blocking the processing of pre-mRNA and nuclear export

467

of mRNA, thus preventing a crucial step in SGs assembly pathway. Our unpublished

468

data show that nsp15 interferes with the host protein translation and retains poly(A)

469

binding protein 1 (PABP1) in the nucleus, and that the endoribonuclease activity is

470

specifically required for this function. Thus, nsp15 probably also targets host mRNA to

471

prevent SGs assembly. As the nsp15 endoribonuclease is conserved, we speculate that

472

coronaviruses employ similar mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs

473

formation for efficient virus proliferation. Altogether, this study is the first to

474

demonstrated that IBV coronavirus antagonize the formation of antiviral hubs SGs

475

through the activity of its endoribonuclease nsp15, and that this is required for efficient

476

virus proliferation.

513

The plasmids encoding IBV nsp2, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp15,

514

nsp16, 3b, E, 5a, 5b, M and N were generated by amplification of cDNA from IBV

515

Beaudette-infected Vero cells using corresponding primers (Table 2) and cloned into

516

PXJ40F. The restriction endonuclease sites for most inserts were BamH I and Xho I,

517

while the restriction endonuclease sites for M are EcoR I and Xho I. The catalytic mutant

518

plasmids of IBV nsp15 was cloned by using Mut Express II Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2

519

(Vazyme) as further detailed below. The mutagenesis primers are shown in table 2.

520

Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in a 24 wells cluster (25,000 cells/well). The

521

indicated plasmids were transfected into cells using Fugene HD (Promega) according

522

to the manufacturer’s handbook. Briefly, 0.5 μg plasmid and 1.5 μl Fugene HD

523

(m/v=1:3) were diluted and incubated in 0.25 ml OptiMEM (Gibco). After 5 min,

524

plasmid and Fugene HD were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min,

525

allowing the formation of lipid-plasmid complex. Finally, the complex was added to

526

the cultured cells and incubated for 24 h.

Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy

529

Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in a 24 wells cluster (25,000 cells/well) and the

530

next day were infected with virus or transfected with various plasmids or with poly I:C

531

(0.25 μg/well). At the indicated time points, cells were treated with heat shock (50℃，

532

20 min), sodium arsenite （ 1 mM, 30 min） , NaCl (200 nM, 50 min), or

533

cycloheximide (CHX-100 μg/ml, 1 h) , in the latter case DMSO was used as negative

534

control. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room

temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton

536

X-100 in PBS for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS) for 1 h.

537

Cells were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (as indicated

538

in Table 1) overnight at 4℃, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor conjugated

539

secondary antibody diluted with 1:500 in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37℃. In case of

540

double staining, cells were incubated with a different unconjugated primary antibody,

541

followed by incubation with the corresponding conjugated secondary antibody and

542

incubated as described before. Between and after each incubation step, the cell

543

monolayer was washed three times with blocking buffer. DAPI was then applied to

544

stain nuclei for 15 min. Finally, cells were washed once with PBS and examined by

545

Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

548

Total cellular RNAs were extracted using Trizol reagent (Ambion). cDNAs were

549

synthesized from 2µg total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and M-MLV reverse

550

transcriptase system (Promega). cDNA was used as template for quantitative PCR using

551

a Bio-Rad CFX-96 real time PCR apparatus and SYBR green master mix (Dongsheng

552

Biotech). PCR conditions were as follow: an initial denaturation at 94℃ for 3 min, 40

553

cycles of 94℃ for 15 s, 60℃ for 15 s and 72℃ for 20 s. The specificity of the amplified

554

PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis after each reaction. The primers

555

used were: for human IFN-β, 5’-GCTTGGATTCCTACAAAGAAGCA-3’ (F) and 5’-

556

ATAGATGGTCAATGCGGCGTC-3’ (R); for human IFIT1, 5’-GCCATTTTCTT

Western blotting analysis

572

Cells were lysed in 2x protein loading buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 100 mM DTT,

573

20% glycerol, 0.016% bromophenol blue). Cell debris was pelleted at 15000 ⅹg for

574

10 min and 10 μg of the cleared cell lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and

575

transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane (GE life Sciences). Membranes were

576

blocked in blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk, TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, followed

577

by incubation with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer as indicated in S2 table

578

overnight at 4℃. The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies

579

diluted in blocking buffer as indicated in S2 table for 1 h at room temperature. Between

580

and after the incubations, membranes were washed three time with washing buffer (0.1%

581

Tween in TBS). The signals were developed with luminol chemiluminescence reagent

582

kit (Share-bio) and detected using Tanon 4600 Chemiluminescent Imaging System (Bio

587

For quantification of SGs formation, images from 20 random high-powered fields were

588

captured. The number of infected cells (IBV-N positive) in the acquired fields was

589

counted. Cells displaying IBV-N expression and G3BP1 foci were counted as positive

590

for SGs formation. The relative percentage of infected cells showing SGs formation

591

was calculated as: (number of cells with G3BP1 granules and IBV-N protein expression

Generation of G3BP1/2 knock out cell

597

Lenti CRISPRv2 was ligated with a pair of guide sequences targeting G3BP1/2 exon 1

598

which were designed by Zhang’lab (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources). The

599

sgRNA of G3BP1 is 5’- CACCGTGTCCGTAGACTGCATCTGC-3’ and G3BP2 is 5’-

600

CACCGTACTTTGCTGAATAAAGCTC-3’. The recombinant plasmid (14.5 μg),

601

together with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (14.5 μg) and pMD2.G (10 μg), were

602

transfected into 70% confluence of HEK 293T cells in a 10 cm dish with Fugene

603

(m/v=1:3) to package lentiviruses. The supernatants containing lentiviruses were

604

collected at 48 h post-transfection and concentrated by centrifugation (2000 ⅹ rpm, 15

605

min). H1299 cells were then infected with lentiviruses containing 8 μg/ml polybrene.

606

After 48 h.p.i., puromycin (2 μg/ml) was applied to select for G3BP knockout cells.

607

The G3BP1 and G3BP2 stably knockout cells were obtained after 5-6 passages and the

608

absence of G3BP1/2 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis and genome

609

sequencing.

625

PBS were co-transfected into Vero cells by electroporation (450 v, 50 μF, 3 mSec,

626

GenePulser Xcell, BIO-RAD). After 48 h, the supernatant was collected and used to

627

inoculate new Vero cells. When syncytia appeared, the supernatant was collected again

628

and passaged on Vero cells for 3 to 5 times. Finally, the virus-containing medium was

629

collected and sequenced. Viral titer was determined by TCID50.

809

and PKR, MDA5, TLR3, MAVS, TRAF3, TRAF6, TBK1, IKKε (green) were detected

810

with corresponding antibodies. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Shown are

Fig 11. The working model of inhibition of anti-viral stress granule formation by

814

infectious bronchitis virus nsp15. 1) IBV genome replication and mRNA

815

transcription produce dsRNA. Nsp15 functions to cleave viral dsRNA and reduce its

816

accumulation. Thus, virus avoids activation of PKR and impedes SGs formation. 2)

817

Absence of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in rIBV-nsp15-H238A, results in the

818

accumulation of viral dsRNA, activation of PKR, and subsequent formation of SGs.

819

The aggregation of PRRs and signaling intermediates to SGs facilitates the signaling

820

transduction and IRF3 activation, finally inducing the expression of IFN-β. Production

821

of IFN-β in turn, effectively limits rIBV-nsp15-H238A proliferation. 3) In parallel,

822

nsp15 may also cleave host mRNA or interfere with host mRNA nuclear export or

823

processing thereby preventing the assembly of SGs or promoting their disassembly.
