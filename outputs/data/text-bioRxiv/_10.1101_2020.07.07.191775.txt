Abstract

11

Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials

12

to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Here we used a Syrian hamster model to

13

assess the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its

14

pharmacokinetics. When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had

15

a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation

16

of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of

17

mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. The antiviral efficacy observed in this

18

study was achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human

19

clinical trials and was associated with weight losses in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and

20

tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans.

Introduction

24

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a

25

pandemic1. The COVID-19 outbreak was originally identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and

26

spread rapidly around the world within a few months. The severe acute respiratory syndrome

27

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, belongs to the Coronaviridae family and

28

is closely related to the SARS-CoV which emerged in China in 20022. After an incubation period of about

29

5 days, disease onset usually begins with an influenza-like syndrome associated with high virus

30

replication in respiratory tracts3,4. In some patients, a late acute respiratory distress syndrome,

31

associated with high levels of inflammatory proteins, occurs within one to two weeks3. As of 7 July

32

2020, more than 11.6 million cases of COVID-19 have resulted in more than 538,000 deaths5. In the

33

face of this ongoing pandemic and its unprecedented repercussions, not only on human health but

34

also on society, ecology and economy, there is an urgent need for effective infection prevention and

35

control measures.

36

Whilst host-directed and immune-based therapies could prove useful for the clinical management of

37

critically ill patients, the availability of safe and effective antiviral molecules would represent an

38

important step towards fighting the current pandemic. As conventional drug development is a slow

39

process, repurposing of drugs already approved for any indication was extensively explored and led to

40

the implementation of many clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-196. However, the development

41

of effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, should, as much as possible, rely on robust

42

pre-clinical in vivo data, not only on efficacy generated in vitro. Accordingly, rapid implementation of

43

rodent and non-human primate animal models should help to assess more finely the potential safety

44

and efficacy of drug candidates and to determine appropriated dose regimens in humans7,8.

45

Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamine) is an anti‐influenza drug approved in Japan

46

that has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a variety of other RNA viruses9-15. Favipiravir

47

is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly into its active ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate form that

48

acts as a nucleotide analogue to selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and induce lethal

49

mutagenesis16,17. Recently, several studies reported in vitro inhibitory activity of favipiravir against

50

SARS-CoV-2 with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) ranging from 62 to >500µM (10 to >78µg/mL)18-

51

20

52

are ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). In the present study, a Syrian hamster model (Mesocricetus

53

auratus) was implemented to explore the in vivo safety and efficacy and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of

54

several dosing regimens of favipiravir.

. Based on these results, more than 20 clinical trials on the management of COVID-19 by favipiravir

Results

56

In vitro efficacy of favipiravir

57

Using VeroE6 cells and an antiviral assay based on reduction of cytopathic effect (CPE), we recorded

58

EC50 and EC90 of 32 and 52.5 µg/mL using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, 70.0 and >78.5µg/mL

59

with an MOI of 0.01 (Figure S1) in accordance with previous studies18-20. Infectious titer reductions

60

(fold change in comparison with untreated cells) were ≥2 with 19.6µg/mL of favipiravir and ranged

61

between 11 and 342 with 78.5µg/mL. Using CaCo2 cells, which do not exhibit CPE with SARS-CoV-2

62

BavPat1 strain, infectious titer reductions were around 5 with 19.6µg/mL of favipiravir and ranged

63

between 144 and 7721 with 78.5µg/mL of the drug. 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) in VeroE6 and

64

CaCo2 cells were >78.5µg/mL.

65

Infection of Syrian hamsters with SARS-CoV-2

66

Following Chan et al., we implemented a hamster model to study the efficacy of antiviral compounds7.

67

Firstly, we intranasally infected four-week-old female Syrian hamsters with 106 TCID50 of virus. Groups

68

of two animals were sacrificed 2, 3, 4 and 7 days post-infection (dpi). Viral replication was quantified

69

in sacrificed animals by RT-qPCR in organs (lungs, brain, liver, small/large bowel, kidney, spleen and

70

heart) and plasma. Viral loads in lungs peaked at 2 dpi, remained elevated until 4 dpi and dramatically

71

decreased at 7 dpi (Figure 1a). Viral loads in plasma peaked at 3 dpi and viral replication was detected

72

in the large bowel at 2 dpi (Figure 1b and Table S1). No viral RNA was detected in almost all the other

73

samples tested (Table S1). Subsequently, we infected animals with two lower doses of virus (105 and

74

104 TCID50). Viral RNA was quantified in lungs, large bowel and plasma from sacrificed animals 2, 3, 4

75

and 7 dpi (Figure 1a and 1b). Viral loads in lungs peaked at 2 and 3 dpi with doses of 105 and 104 TCID50

76

respectively. Maximum viral loads in lungs of animals infected with each dose of virus were

77

comparable. Viral RNA yields in plasma and large bowel followed a similar trend but with more

78

variability, with this two lower doses. In addition, clinical monitoring of animals showed no marked

79

symptoms of infection but significant weight losses from 3 dpi when compared to animals intranasally

80

inoculated with sodium chloride 0.9% (Figure 1c).

87

In vivo efficacy of favipiravir

88

To assess the efficacy of favipiravir, hamsters received the drug, intraperitoneally, three times a day

89

(TID). We used three doses of favipiravir: 18.75, 37.5 and 75mg/day (corresponding to 340±36, 670±42

90

and 1390±126 mg/kg/day respectively).

91

In a first set of experiments, treatment was initiated at day of infection (preemptive antiviral therapy)

92

and ended at 2 dpi. We infected groups of 6 animals intranasally with three doses of virus (106, 105 and

93

104 TCID50) and viral replication was measured in lungs and plasma at 3 dpi (Figure 2a). When analysis

94

of virus replication in clarified lung homogenates was based on infectious titers (as measured using

95

TCID50 assay), the effect of favipiravir in reducing infectious titers was dose dependent, in particular

96

when low doses of virus were used to infect animals (Figure 2b). At each dose of virus, mean infectious

97

titers for groups of animals treated with 75mg/day TID were significantly lower than those observed

98

with untreated groups (p≤0.0001): reduction of infectious titers ranged between 1.9 and 3.7 log10. For

99

animals infected with 105 or 104 TCID50, significant infectious titer reductions of around 0.8 log10 were

100

also observed with the dose of 37,5mg/day TID (p≤0.038). Drug 90% and 99% effective doses (ED90 and

101

ED99) were estimated based on these results and ranged between 31-42mg/day and 53-70mg/day

102

respectively (Table 2). When analysis of virus replication in clarified lung homogenates were assessed

103

on viral RNA yields (as measured using quantitative real time RT-PCR assay), significant differences

104

with groups of untreated animals, ranging between 0.7 and 2.5 log10, were observed only with the

105

higher dose of favipiravir (p≤0.012). Once again, this difference was more noticeable with lower doses

106

of virus (Figure 2b). Since we found higher reductions of infectious titers than those observed with viral

107

RNA yields, we estimated the relative infectivity of viral particle (i.e. the ratio of the number of

108

infectious particles over the number of viral RNA molecules). Decreased infectivity was observed in all

109

treated groups of animals. These differences were always significant with the higher dose of favipiravir

(p≤0.031) and were significant with the dose of 37.5mg/day TID for animals infected with 105 or 104

111

TCID50 of virus (p≤0.041). We then measured plasmatic viral loads using quantitative real time RT-PCR

112

assay and found, with the higher dose of favipiravir and the groups of animals infected with 106 or 104

113

TCID50, significant reductions of 2.1 and 2.62 log10, respectively (p≤0.022) (Figure 2b).

126

In a second set of experiments, we assessed, over a period of 7 days, the impact of treatment on the

127

clinical course of the disease using weight loss as the primary criterion (Figure 3a). Beforehand, we

128

evaluated the toxicity of the three doses of favipiravir with groups of four non-infected animals treated

129

from day 0 to day 3 (Figure 3b). High toxicity was observed with the dose of 75mg/day TID with

130

significant weight loss noticed from the first day of treatment (Table S4). We also found a constant,

131

but moderate, toxicity with the dose of 37.5mg/day TID that was significant at day 4 and 5 only. No

132

toxicity was detected with the lower dose of favipiravir. To assess if the toxicity observed with the

133

highest dose of favipiravir was exacerbated by the infection, we compared weight losses of infected

134

and non-infected animals treated with the dose of 75mg/day TID. Regardless of the dose of virus, no

135

significant difference was observed at 1, 2 and 3 dpi (Figure S3). After this evaluation of favipiravir

136

toxicity, we intranasally infected groups of 10 animals with two doses of virus (105 or 104 TCID50).

137

Treatment with a dose of 37.5mg/day TID was initiated on the day of infection (preemptive antiviral

138

therapy) and ended at 3 dpi (Figure 3a). With both doses of virus, treatment was associated with

139

clinical alleviation of the disease (Figure 3c-d). With the dose of 105 TCID50, mean weights of treated

140

animals were significantly higher than those of untreated animals at 5 and 6 dpi (p≤0.031). Similar

141

observations were made with the dose of 104 TCID50 at 5, 6 and 7 dpi (p<0.0001).

150

0.05 respectively (details in Table S2 and S4).

151

In a third set of experiments, treatment was started one day before infection (preventive antiviral

152

therapy) and ended at 2 dpi. We intranasally infected groups of 6 animals with 104 TCID50 of virus and

153

viral replication was measured in lungs and plasma at 3 dpi (Figure 4a). Once again, an inverse

154

relationship was observed between lung infectious titers and the dose of favipiravir (Figure 4b). Mean

155

infectious titers for groups of animals treated with 37.5 and 75mg/day TID were significantly lower

156

than those observed with untreated groups (p≤0.002). Of note, undetectable infectious titers were

157

found for all animals treated with the higher dose. Estimated ED90 and ED99 were 35 and 47mg/day

158

respectively (Table 2). Significant reductions of viral RNA yields of 0.9 and 3.3 log10, were observed with

159

animals treated with 37.5 and 75mg/day TID respectively (p≤0.023). Resulting infectivity of viral

160

particle was decreased, with a significant reduction only for the higher dose of favipiravir (p=0.005).

161

Finally, we found significantly reduced plasmatic viral loads with animals treated with 37.5 and

162

75mg/day TID (p≤0.005).

174

Favipiravir pharmacokinetics (PK) in a hamster model

175

We first assessed the PK and lung distribution of favipiravir in a subgroup of uninfected animals. Groups

176

of animals were treated respectively with a single dose of favipiravir administrated intraperitoneally:

177

6.25mg, 12.5mg and 25mg. In each dose group, we sacrificed 3 animals at specific time points post-

178

treatment (0.5, 1, 5 or 8 hours) for determination of favipiravir in plasma. Drug concentration in lung

179

tissue was determined at 0.5 and 5 hours post-treatment. Subsequently, we assessed the favipiravir

180

concentration after multiple dose in animals intranasally infected with 105 TCID50 of virus. Groups of 9

181

animals received the three doses evaluated for 3 days (Figure 2a): 18.75mg/day, 37.5mg/day and

182

75mg/day TID and were sacrificed at 12-hours after the last treatment dose. Favipiravir was quantified

183

in plasma (n=9) and lung tissue (n=3).

184

Results are presented in Table 3 and Figure S4. The single dose PK analysis showed that the maximum

185

concentration of favipiravir was observed at 0.5 hour at all doses, then plasma drug concentrations

186

decreased exponentially to reach concentrations below 10µg/ml at 12 hours. Favipiravir PK exhibited

187

a non-linear increase in concentration between the doses. After multiple doses, trough concentrations

188

(12 hours) of favipiravir also exhibited a non-linear increase between doses. The extrapolated 12 hours

189

post-treatment concentrations after a single dose were calculated in order to determine the

190

accumulation ratio. Accumulation ratios were respectively 6, 16 and 21 at the 3 doses, confirming the

191

non-proportional increase between doses. The average concentration after single dose administration

192

over 0 to 12-hour intervals was calculated and the respective values obtained were 10.1µg/mL,

193

38.7µg/mL and 100.5µg/mL for the 3 favipiravir doses.

194

Favipiravir lung concentrations were 1.6 to 2.7-fold lower than in plasma for both administration of

195

single and multiple doses. After a single dose, the mean lung to plasma ratio ranged from 0.37 to 0.62

196

according to the time post-treatment and was similar between the 3 doses of favipiravir at 0.5 hours.

197

A high ratio 5 hours post-treatment was observed at the highest dose (25mg) with an increase by a

198

factor 1.6 to 1.8 compared with the lower doses. After multiple doses, the lung penetration of

199

favipiravir was confirmed with a mean lung to plasma ratio ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Favipiravir was

200

not detected in the lungs at the lowest dose (18.75mg/day).

Mutagenic effect of favipiravir

208

To understand which genomic modifications accompanied favipiravir treatment, direct complete

209

genome sequencing of clarified lung homogenates from animals intranasally infected with 106 TCID50

210

of virus and treated with the two highest doses of drug (preemptive antiviral therapy; Figure 2) was

211

performed. Data were generated by next generation sequencing from lung samples of four animals

212

per group (untreated, 37.5mg/day TID and 75mg/day TID). The mean sequencing coverage for each

213

sample ranged from 10,991 to 37,991 reads per genomic position and we subjected substitutions with

214

a frequency ≥1% to further analysis. The genetic variability in virus stock was also analyzed: 14

215

nucleotide polymorphisms were detected of which 5 recorded a mutation frequency higher than 10%

216

(Table S6).

217

In order to study the mutagenic effect of favipiravir, we used the consensus sequence from virus stock

218

as reference and all the mutations simultaneously detected in a lung sample and in virus stock were

219

not considered in the further analysis (1 to 4 mutations per sample, see Table S6). Overall, no majority

220

mutations were detected (mutation frequency >50%), mutations were distributed throughout the

221

whole genome and almost all of them exhibited a frequency lower than 10% (Figure 5a and 5b).

222

Results revealed a relationship between the number of mutations detected per sample and the dose

223

of favipiravir (Figure 5c): the mean number of mutations increased by a factor 2 and 4.8 with groups

224

of animals treated with 37.5 and 75mg/day TID, respectively. The difference is significant only with a

225

dose of 37.5mg/day TID (p=0.029). This increase of the number of mutations is mainly the consequence

226

of the occurrence of a large number of G→A substitutions and, to a lesser extent, C→U substitutions.

227

Consequently, regardless of the dose of favipiravir, mean frequency of G→A substitutions was

228

significantly increased by a factor of 4.2 (p≤0.009). This rise of these transition mutations led to

229

increased frequency of all transition mutations (significant only at dose of 37.5mg/day TID; p=0.037)

230

and increased frequency of non-synonymous mutations (significant only at dose of 75mg/day TID;

231

p=0.009) (Figure 5d). We investigated whether or not effectiveness in treated animals was linked with

232

the characteristics of the mutations detected on viral populations and found that infectious titers in

233

lungs were negatively associated with frequency of non-synonymous and G→A mutations, and

234

positively associated with frequency of synonymous mutations (p<0.03; Figure 5e). Finally, our

235

experiments revealed some parallel evolution events; 32 substitutions in viral sub-populations were

236

detected in two independent animals. Notably, 18 of these shared mutations were detected only with

237

treated animals, 14 of them being non-synonymous (Table S8). These mutations are located in nsp2,

238

3, 4, 5, 6, 14, N protein, Matrix, ORF 3a and 8. At this stage, one cannot conclude if these substitutions

239

reflect the adaptation to the hamster model or are the result of the antiviral selection.

Discussion

255

In the current study, we used a hamster model to assess efficacy of the favipiravir against SARS-CoV-

256

2. Following infection, viral RNA was mainly detected in lungs, blood, and, to a lesser extent, in the

257

large bowel. Peak of viral replication was observed at 2-3 dpi followed by observation of significant

258

weight losses, in line with recently reported investigations that involved 6-10 weeks old hamsters7,21.

259

Clinically, the main symptom was weight loss, observed from the first day of infection and followed by

260

recovery at 6dpi. This confirmed that the in vivo model, with younger animals (4 weeks-old), is suitable

261

for preclinical evaluation of antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2.

262

Using a preemptive strategy, we demonstrated that doses of favipiravir of around 700-1400mg/kg/day

263

TID reduced viral replication in lungs of infected animals and allowed clinical alleviation of the disease.

264

In the most favourable situation, where high doses were used as a preventive therapy, favipiravir led

265

to undetectable viral replication in lung and plasma. These results showed that the use of high doses

266

of favipiravir could expand its in vivo spectrum against RNA viruses.

267

Reduction of viral replication was greater when estimated on the basis of infectious titers than on total

268

viral RNA as previously observed in non-human primates treated with Remdesivir22. However, the

269

effective doses of favipiravir were higher than those usually used in rodent models (≈100-

270

400mg/kg/day)10,12,23-26. This can be correlated with the high favipiravir EC50 found in vitro for SARS-

271

CoV-2. Moreover, effective doses were associated with significant toxicity in our hamster model. This

272

observed toxicity reflected only the adverse effects of favipiravir and was not exacerbated during SARS-

273

CoV-2 infection. Indeed, similar weight losses were measured among infected and non-infected

274

animals treated with the highest dose of favipiravir at 1, 2 and 3dpi.

275

In the present study, reduction of viral replication was correlated with the dose of favipiravir

276

administrated and inversely correlated with the dose of virus inoculated. In a recent study, favipiravir

277

administrated per os twice daily (loading dose of 600mg/kg/day followed by 300mg/kg/day) revealed

278

a mild reduction of lung viral RNA yields using a similar hamster model with high doses of virus (2x106

279

TCID50)21. These results are in accordance with ours at the lower dose of favipiravir (around

280

340mg/kg/day TID).

281

With influenza viruses, favipiravir acts as a nucleotide analogue. It is metabolized intracellularly to its

282

active form and incorporated into nascent viral RNA strands. This inhibits RNA strand extension and

283

induces abnormal levels of mutation accumulation into the viral genome16,17. Recently, it was shown

284

in vitro that favipiravir has a similar mechanism of action with SARS-CoV-2 through a combination of

285

chain termination, reduced RNA synthesis and lethal mutagenesis20. Our genomic analysis confirmed

286

the mutagenic effect of favipiravir in vivo. Indeed, we found that favipiravir treatment induced

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775; this version posted July 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

287

appearance of a large number of G→A and C→U mutations into viral genomes. This was associated to

288

a decrease of viral infectivity probably because alteration of the genomic RNA disturb the replication

289

capacity. Similar findings were described in vitro and in vivo with other RNA viruses9,16,27,28. Of note, we

290

also observed a strong inverse association between infectious titers in lungs and the proportion of

291

non-synonymous mutations detected in viral populations. Because random non-synonymous

292

mutations are more deleterious than synonymous mutations29, this suggests that they were randomly

293

distributed over the three positions of the codons and that no compensatory mechanism was triggered

294

by the virus to eliminate them (i.e. negative selection). Finally, the inverse correlation between lung

295

infections titers and the frequency of G→A substitutions showed that an increased proportion of these

296

mutations beyond an error threshold might be expected to cause lethal mutagenesis.

297

Genomic analyses revealed that 18 mutations detected in viral sub-populations were shared only with

298

treated animals. Two of them were located in the nsp14 coding region involved in the proof-reading

299

activity of the viral RNA polymerisation30,31. However, they were located in the N7 MTase domain

300

involved in viral RNA capping32,33. By comparison, resistance mutations selected against Remdesivir in

301

β-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus model were obtained in the RdRP (nsp12) coding sequence34.

302

Further investigations are needed to assess the impact of these mutations on the antiviral effect of

303

favipiravir.

304

Favipiravir PK in our hamster model displayed a non-linear increase in plasma exposure between the

305

doses as already reported in nonhuman primates35. The observed favipiravir concentration versus time

306

profiles were in agreement with previous results of a PK study performed in 7-8 week-old hamsters

307

orally treated with a single dose of 100mg/kg of favipiravir36. The maximum plasma drug concentration

308

occurred at 0.5 h after oral administration, earlier than in humans, and then decreased rapidly in

309

agreement with its short half-life37. After repeated doses, plasma exposure confirmed non-linear PK

310

over the entire range of doses, further emphasized by accumulation ratios. The important

311

accumulation observed at the highest dose could explain in part the toxicity observed in hamsters at

312

this dose. Favipiravir undergoes an important hepatic metabolism mainly by aldehyde oxidase

313

producing an inactive M1 metabolite and inhibits aldehyde oxidase activity in a concentration- and

314

time-dependent manner. These properties explain the self-inhibition of its own metabolism as

315

observed in our study in which the highest dose of favipiravir led to a greater increase in favipiravir

316

concentrations38.

317

A good penetration of favipiravir in lungs was observed with lung/plasma ratios ranging from 35 to

318

44% after repeated doses, consistent with its physicochemical properties. Lung exposure was also in

319

accordance with previous studies36.

320

The medium dose of favipiravir used in this study (670mg/kg/day TID) is within the range of the

321

estimated doses required to reduce by 90% (ED90) the level of infectious titers in lungs (ranging

322

between 570 and 780mg/kg/day). Animals treated with this dose displayed significant reduction of

323

viral replication in lungs, limited drug-associated toxicity and clinical alleviation of the disease.

324

Regarding the accumulation ratio after repeated doses and the good penetration of favipiravir in lungs,

325

effective concentrations can be expected in lungs, throughout the course of treatment using this dose

326

of 670mg/kg/day TID.

327

How clinically realistic are these results? To address this question we compared the drug

328

concentrations obtained in the hamster model with those obtained in patients. In 2016, a clinical trial

329

evaluated the use of favipiravir in Ebola infected patients39. The dose used in Ebola infected patients

330

was 6000mg on day 0 followed by 1200mg BID for 9 days. The median trough concentrations of

331

favipiravir at Day 2 and Day 4 were 46.1 and 25.9µg/mL, respectively. This is within the range observed

332

here in hamsters treated with the highest dose (around 1400mg/kg/day), with a mean trough

333

concentration of 29.9µg/mL. However, additional investigations are required to determine whether or

334

not similar favipiravir plasma exposure in SARS-COV-2 infected patients are associated with antiviral

335

activity. The major differences in PK between hamster and humans, and the toxicity observed at the

336

highest doses in our animal model limits the extrapolation of our results. Therefore, whether safe

337

dosing regimens in humans may achieve similar plasma exposure and recapitulate the profound effect

338

on viral replication is unknown. Further, the intracellular concentration of the active metabolite was

339

not determined and which parameter of the drug pharmacokinetics best drives the antiviral effect

340

remains to be established.

341

In summary, this study establishes that high doses of favipiravir are associated with antiviral activity

342

against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster model. The better antiviral efficacy was observed using a

343

preventive strategy, suggesting that favipiravir could be more appropriate for a prophylactic use. Our

344

results should be interpreted with caution because high doses of favipiravir were associated with signs

345

of toxicity in our model. It is required to determine if a tolerable dosing regimen could generate similar

346

exposure in non-human primates, associated with significant antiviral activity, before testing a high

347

dose regimen in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, subsequent studies should determine if an increased

348

antiviral efficacy can be reached using favipiravir in association with other effective antiviral drugs,

349

since this strategy may enable to reduce the dosing regimen of favipiravir. Finally, this work reinforces

350

the need for rapid development of animal models to confirm in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds

351

and accordingly, to determine appropriate dose regimens in humans before starting clinical trials.

Methods

353

Cells

354

VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37) were grown at 37°C with 5% CO2 in

355

minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS),

356

1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% non-essential amino acids (all from ThermoFisher Scientific).

357

Virus

358

All experiments with infectious virus were conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory. SARS-CoV-2

359

strain BavPat1, supplied through European Virus Archive GLOBAL (https://www.european-virus-

360

archive.com/), was provided by Christian Drosten (Berlin, Germany). Virus stocks were prepared by

361

inoculating at MOI of 0.001 a 25cm2 culture flask of confluent VeroE6 cells with MEM medium

362

supplemented with 2.5% FBS. The cell supernatant medium was replaced each 24h hours and

363

harvested at the peak of infection, supplemented with 25mM HEPES (Sigma), aliquoted and stored at

364

-80°C.

365

In vitro determination of EC50, EC90, CC50 and infectious titer reductions

366

One day prior to infection, 5×104 VeroE6 cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates (5×104 cells/well

367

in 100µL of 2.5% FBS medium (assay medium). The next day, seven 2-fold serial dilutions of favipiravir

368

(Courtesy of Toyama-Chemical; 0.61µg/mL to 78.5µg/mL, in triplicate) were added (25µL/well, in assay

369

medium). Eight virus control wells were supplemented with 25µL of assay medium and eight cell

370

controls were supplemented with 50µL of assay medium. After 15 min, 25µL of virus suspension,

371

diluted in assay medium, was added to the wells at an MOI of 0.01 or 0.001 (except for cell controls).

372

Three days after infection, cell supernatant media were collected to perform TCID50 assay (at

373

concentration of 78.5, 39.3, 19.6µg/mL), as described below, in order to calculate infectious titer

374

reductions and cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Blue reagent (Promega) following

375

manufacturer’s intructions. Fluorescence (560/590nm) was recorded with a Tecan Infinite 200Pro

376

machine (Tecan). The 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50, EC90) were determined using

377

logarithmic interpolation (% of inhibition were calculated as follows: (ODsample-ODvirus control)/(ODcell control-

378

ODvirus control)). For the evaluation of CC50 (the concentration that induced 50% cytoxicity), the same

379

culture conditions were set as for the determination of the EC50, without addition of the virus, then

380

cell viability was measured using CellTiter Blue (Promega). CC50 was determined using logarithmic

381

interpolation.

In vivo experiments

383

Approval and authorization

384

In vivo experiments were approved by the local ethical committee (C2EA—14) and the French

385

‘Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche et de l’Innovation’ (APAFIS#23975) and

386

performed in accordance with the French national guidelines and the European legislation covering

387

the use of animals for scientific purposes. All experiments were conducted in BSL 3 laboratory.

388

Animal handling

389

Three-week-old female Syrian hamsters were provided by Janvier Labs. Animals were maintained in

390

ISOcage P - Bioexclusion System (Techniplast) with unlimited access to water/food and 14h/10h

391

light/dark cycle. Animals were weighed and monitored daily for the duration of the study to detect the

392

appearance of any clinical signs of illness/suffering. Virus inoculation was performed under general

393

anesthesia (isoflurane). Organs and blood were collected after euthanasia (cervical dislocation) which

394

was also realized under general anesthesia (isofluorane).

395

Hamster Infection

396

Anesthetized animals (four-week-old) were intranasally infected with 50µL containing 106, 105 or

397

104 TCID50 of virus in 0.9% sodium chloride solution). The mock group was intranasally inoculated with

398

50µL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.

399

Favipiravir administration

400

Hamster were intra-peritoneally inoculated with different doses of favipiravir. Control group were

401

intra-peritoneally inoculated with a 0.9% sodium chloride solution.

402

Organ collection

403

Organs were first washed in 10mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution and then transferred to a 2mL or

404

50mL tube containing respectively 1mL (small/large bowel pieces, kidney, spleen and heart) or 10mL

405

(lungs, brain and liver) of 0.9% sodium chloride solution and 3mm glass beads. They were crushed

406

using a the Tissue Lyser machine (Retsch MM400) for 5min at 30 cycles/s and then centrifuged 5min à

407

1200g. Supernatant media were transferred to a 2mL tube, centrifuged 10 min at 16,200g and stored

408

at -80°C. One milliliter of blood was harvested in a 2mL tube containing 100µL of 0.5M EDTA

409

(ThermoFischer Scientific). Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,200g and stored at -80°C.

410

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays

411

To avoid contamination, all experiments were conducted in a molecular biology laboratory that is

412

specifically designed for clinical diagnosis using molecular techniques, and which includes separate

413

laboratories dedicated to perform each step of the procedure. Prior to PCR amplification, RNA

414

extraction was performed using the QIAamp 96 DNA kit and the Qiacube HT kit and the Qiacube HT

415

(both from Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Shortly, 100 µl of organ clarified

416

homogenates, spiked with 10µL of internal control (bacteriophage MS2)40, were transferred into an S-

417

block containing the recommended volumes of VXL, proteinase K and RNA carrier. RT-qPCR (SARS-CoV-

418

2 and MS2 viral genome detection) were performed with the Express one step RT-qPCR Universal kit

419

(ThermoFisher Scientific) using 3.5µL of RNA and 6.5µL of RT-qPCR mix that contains 250nmol of each

420

primer and 75nmol of probe. Amplification was performed with the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time

421

PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the following conditions: 50°C for 10min, 95°C for 20s,

422

followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3s, 60°C for 30s. qPCR (ɣ-actine gene detection) was perfomed under

423

the same condition as RT-qPCR with the following modifications: we used the Express one step qPCR

424

Universal kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the 50°C step of the amplification cycle was removed.

425

Primers and probes sequences used to detect SARS-CoV-2, MS2 and ɣ-actine are described in Table S9.

426

Tissue-culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay

427

To determine infectious titers, 96-well culture plates containing confluent VeroE6 cells were

428

inoculated with 150μL per well of serial dilutions of each sample (four-fold or ten-fold dilutions when

429

analyzing lung clarified homogenates or cell supernatant media respectively). Each dilution was

430

performed in sextuplicate. Plates were incubated for 4 days and then read for the absence or presence

431

of cytopathic effect in each well. Infectious titers were estimated using the method described by Reed

432

& Muench41.

433

Favipiravir pharmacokinetics

434

Animal handling, hamster infections and favipiravir administrations were performed as described

435

above. A piece of left lung was first washed in 10mL of sodium chloride 0.9% solution, blotted with

436

filter paper, weighed and then transferred to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.9% sodium chloride

437

solution and 3mm glass beads. It was crushed using the Tissue Lyser machine (Retsch MM400) during

438

10min at 30 cycles/s and then centrifuged 5min à 1200g. Supernatant media were transferred to 2mL

439

tubes, centrifuged 10 min at 16,200g and stored at -80°C. One milliliter of blood was harvested in a

440

2mL tube containing 100µL of 0.5M EDTA (ThermoFischer Scientific). Blood was centrifuged for 10 min

441

at 16,200g and stored at -80°C.

442

Quantification of favipiravir in plasma and lung tissues was performed by a validated sensitive and

443

selective validated high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry

444

method (UPLC-TQD, Waters, USA) with a lower limit of quantification of 0.1 µg/mL. Precision and

445

accuracy of the 3 quality control samples (QCs) were within 15% over the calibration range (0.5 µg/mL

446

to 100 µg/mL) (Bekegnran et al., submitted). Favipiravir was extracted by a simple protein precipitation

447

method, using acetonitrile for plasma and ice-cold acetonitrile for clarified lung homogenates. Briefly,

448

50 µL of samples matrix was added to 500µL of acetonitrile solution containing the internal standard

(favipiravir-13C,15N, Alsachim), then vortexed for 2min followed by centrifugation for 10min at 4°C.

The supernatant medium was evaporated and the dry residues were then transferred to 96-well plates

451

and 50 µL was injected. To assess the selectivity and specificity of the method and matrix effect, blank

452

plasma and tissues homogenates from 2 control animals (uninfected and untreated) were processed

453

at each run. Moreover, the same control samples spiked with favipiravir concentration equivalent to

454

the QCs (0.75, 50 and 80 µg/mL) were also processed and compared to the QCs samples.

455

Noncompartemental analysis conducted using software Pkanalix2019R2 (www.lixoft.com). Areas

456

under the plasma concentration time curve were computed using medians of favipiravir

457

concentrations at 0.5, 1, 5 and 8 hours, and extrapolated until T=12h. Ctrough were extrapolated at

458

T=12h using lambda-z loglinear regression on the decreasing slope of concentrations.

459

Sequence analysis of the full-length genome

460

200µL of lung clarified homogenate or infectious cell supernatant (virus stock) was inactivated with an

461

equal volume of VXL lysis buffer (Qiagen) and viral RNA was extracted using an EZ1 Advanced XL robot

462

with the EZ1 mini virus 2.0 kit (both from Qiagen) and linear acrylamide (ThermoFisher Scientific) in

463

place of carrier RNA. cDNA was generated in a final volume of 40µL using 14µL of nucleic acid extract,

464

random hexamer and the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). A

465

specific set of primers (Table S10) was used to generate thirteen amplicons covering the entire genome

466

with the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR mixes (final volume 25µL)

467

contained 2.5µL of cDNA, 2µL of each primer (10µM) and 12.5 µL of Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix.

468

Amplification was performed with the following conditions: 30 sec at 98°C, then 45 cycles of 15 sec at

469

98°C and 5 min à 65°C. Size of PCR products was verified by gel electrophoresis. For each sample, an

470

equimolar pool of all amplicons was prepared and purified using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (New

471

England Biolabs). After DNA quantification using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer

472

(ThermoFisher Scientific), amplicons were fragmented by sonication into fragments of around 200bp

473

long. Libraries were built by adding barcodes, for sample identification, and primers using AB Library

474

Builder System (ThermoFisher Scientific). To pool equimolarly the barcoded samples a quantification

475

step by real time PCR using Ion Library TaqMan Quantitation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) was

476

performed. Then, emulsion PCR from pools and loading on 530 chip was performed using the

477

automated Ion Chef instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sequencing was performed using the S5 Ion

478

torrent technology v5.12 (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. Consensus

479

sequence was obtained after trimming of reads (reads with quality score <0.99, and length <100pb

480

were removed and the 30 first and 30 last nucleotides were removed from the reads). Mapping of the

481

reads on a reference (determine following blast of De Novo contigs) was done using CLC genomics

482

workbench software v.20 (Qiagen). A de novo contig was also produced to ensure that the consensus

483

sequence was not affected by the reference sequence. Mutation frequency for each position was

484

calculated as the number of reads with a mutation compared to the reference divided by the total

485

number of reads at that site. Only substitutions with a frequency of at least 1% were taken into account

486

for the analysis (Table S6).

487

ED50, ED90 and ED99 determination

488

We conducted a nonlinear regression of infectious viral load against dose, using an Emax model, giving

489

𝑉𝐿 = 𝑉𝐿0 × (1 − (𝐷𝛾 +𝐷𝛾 )) with 𝑉𝐿0 being infectious viral load of untreated animals. We estimated

𝐷𝛾

50

490

𝐷50 the dose required to decrease viral load by 50%, using a coefficient 𝛾 to account for the high

491

sigmoidicity of the relation between dose and titers. 𝛾 coefficient was chosen as the one maximizing

492

𝛾
likelihood of the model. We extrapolated the 𝐷90 and 𝐷99 using 𝐷90 = √9 × 𝐷50 and 𝐷99 =

493

𝛾

𝛾

𝛾
√99 × 𝐷50
, as well as their 95% confidence interval using the delta method.

494

Statistical analysis

495

Graphical representations and statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism 7 (Graphpad

496

software) except linear/nonlinear regressions and their corresponding graphical representations that

497

were performed using R statistical software (http://www.R-project.org). Statistical details for each

498

experiments are described in the figure legends and in corresponding supplemental tables. P-values

499

lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
