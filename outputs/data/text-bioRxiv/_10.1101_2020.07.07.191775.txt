Summary

12

There is a need for safe and effective antiviral molecules with which to combat COVID-19 pandemics.

13

Recently, in vitro inhibitory activity of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 was reported. Here, we used a

14

Syrian hamster model to explore the pharmacokinetics of this molecule and its in vivo efficacy against

15

SARS-CoV-2. Results revealed that high doses (700-1400mg/kg/day) significantly reduced virus

16

replication in the lungs accompanied by clinical alleviation of the disease. However, these high doses

17

were associated with significant toxicity in hamsters. Favipiravir pharmacokinetics displayed non-linear

18

increase in plasma exposure between the doses and good lung penetration. Analysis of viral genomes

19

in vivo showed that favipiravir induced a mutagenic effect. Whilst the plasma trough concentrations

20

observed in this study were comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials, this

21

potential toxicity requires further investigation to assess whether a tolerable dosing regimen can be

22

found in humans that effectively reduces virus replication.

Introduction

26

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a

27

pandemic (WHO, 2020). The COVID-19 outbreak was originally identified in Wuhan, China, in

28

December 2019 and spread rapidly around the world within a few months. The severe acute

29

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, belongs to the

30

Coronaviridae family and is closely related to the SARS-CoV which emerged in China in 2002 (Zhu et

31

al., 2020). After an incubation period of about 5 days, disease onset usually begins with an influenza-

32

like syndrome associated with high virus replication in respiratory tracts (Huang et al., 2020, He et al.,

33

2020). In some patients, a late acute respiratory distress syndrome, associated with high levels of

34

inflammatory proteins, occurs within one to two weeks (Huang et al., 2020). As of 7 July 2020, more

35

than 11.6 million cases of COVID-19 have resulted in more than 538,000 deaths (Dong et al., 2020). In

36

the face of this ongoing pandemic and its unprecedented repercussions, not only on human health but

37

also on society, ecology and economy, there is an urgent need for effective infection prevention and

38

control measures.

39

Whilst host-directed and immune-based therapies could prove useful for the clinical management of

40

critically ill patients, the availability of safe and effective antiviral molecules would represent an

41

important step towards fighting the current pandemic. As conventional drug development is a slow

42

process, repurposing of drugs already approved for any indication was extensively explored and led to

43

the implementation of many clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 (Mercorelli et al., 2018).

44

However, the development of effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, should, as much

45

as possible, rely on robust pre-clinical in vivo data, not only on efficacy generated in vitro. Accordingly,

46

rapid implementation of rodent and non-human primate animal models should help to assess more

47

finely the potential safety and efficacy of drug candidates and to determine appropriated dose

48

regimens in humans (Chan et al., 2020, Rockx et al., 2020).

49

Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamine) is an anti‐influenza drug approved in Japan

50

that has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a variety of other RNA viruses (Guedj et al.,

51

2018, Yamada et al., 2019, Segura Guerrero et al., 2018, Tani et al., 2018, Jochmans et al., 2016,

52

Takahashi et al., 2003, Rosenke et al., 2018). Favipiravir is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly

53

into its active ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate form that acts as a nucleotide analogue to selectively

54

inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and induce lethal mutagenesis (Baranovich et al., 2013,

55

Sangawa et al., 2013). Recently, several studies reported in vitro inhibitory activity of favipiravir against

56

SARS-CoV-2 with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) ranging from 62 to >500µM (10 to >78µg/mL)

57

(Wang et al., 2020, Jeon et al., 2020, Shannon et al., 2020). Based on these results, more than 20 clinical

58

trials on the management of COVID-19 by favipiravir are in progress (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). In the

Results

62

In vitro efficacy of favipiravir

63

Using VeroE6 cells and an antiviral assay based on reduction of cytopathic effect (CPE), we recorded

64

EC50 and EC90 of 32 and 52.5 µg/mL using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, 70.0 and >78.5µg/mL

65

with an MOI of 0.01 (Figure S1) in accordance with previous studies (Wang et al., 2020, Jeon et al.,

66

2020, Shannon et al., 2020). Infectious titer reductions (fold change in comparison with untreated cells)

67

were ≥2 with 19.6µg/mL of favipiravir and ranged between 11 and 342 with 78.5µg/mL. Using CaCo2

68

cells, which do not exhibit CPE with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 strain, infectious titer reductions were around

69

5 with 19.6µg/mL of favipiravir and ranged between 144 and 7721 with 78.5µg/mL of the drug. 50%

70

cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) in VeroE6 and CaCo2 cells were >78.5µg/mL.

71

Infection of Syrian hamsters with SARS-CoV-2

72

Following Chan et al., we implemented a hamster model to study the efficacy of antiviral compounds

73

(Chan et al., 2020). Firstly, we intranasally infected four-week-old female Syrian hamsters with 106

74

TCID50 of virus. Groups of two animals were sacrificed 2, 3, 4 and 7 days post-infection (dpi). Viral

75

replication was quantified in sacrificed animals by RT-qPCR in organs (lungs, brain, liver, small/large

76

bowel, kidney, spleen and heart) and plasma. Viral loads in lungs peaked at 2 dpi, remained elevated

77

until 4 dpi and dramatically decreased at 7 dpi (Figure 1a). Viral loads in plasma peaked at 3 dpi and

78

viral replication was detected in the large bowel at 2 dpi (Figure 1b and Table S1). No viral RNA was

79

detected in almost all the other samples tested (Table S1). Subsequently, we infected animals with two

80

lower doses of virus (105 and 104 TCID50). Viral RNA was quantified in lungs, large bowel and plasma

81

from sacrificed animals 2, 3, 4 and 7 dpi (Figure 1a and 1b). Viral loads in lungs peaked at 2 and 3 dpi

82

with doses of 105 and 104 TCID50 respectively. Maximum viral loads in lungs of animals infected with

83

each dose of virus were comparable. Viral RNA yields in plasma and large bowel followed a similar

84

trend but with more variability, with this two lower doses. In addition, clinical monitoring of animals

85

showed no marked symptoms of infection but significant weight losses from 3 dpi when compared to

86

animals intranasally inoculated with sodium chloride 0.9% (Figure 1c).

91

93

In vivo efficacy of favipiravir

94

To assess the efficacy of favipiravir, hamsters received the drug, intraperitoneally, three times a day

95

(TID). We used three doses of favipiravir: 18.75, 37.5 and 75mg/day (corresponding to 340±36, 670±42

96

and 1390±126 mg/kg/day respectively).

97

In a first set of experiments, treatment was initiated at day of infection (preemptive antiviral therapy)

98

and ended at 2 dpi. We infected groups of 6 animals intranasally with three doses of virus (106, 105 and

99

104 TCID50) and viral replication was measured in lungs and plasma at 3 dpi (Figure 2a). When analysis

100

of virus replication in clarified lung homogenates was based on infectious titers (as measured using

101

TCID50 assay), an inverse relationship was observed between infectious titers and the dose of

102

favipiravir (Figure 2b). This trend was even more important when low doses of virus were used to infect

103

animals. At each dose of virus, mean infectious titers for groups of animals treated with 75mg/day TID

104

were significantly lower than those observed with untreated groups (p≤0.0001): reduction of infectious

105

titers ranged between 1.9 and 3.7 log10. For animals infected with 105 or 104 TCID50, significant

106

infectious titer reductions of around 0.8 log10 were also observed with the dose of 37,5mg/day TID

107

(p≤0.038). Drug 90% and 99% effective doses (ED90 and ED99) were estimated based on these results

108

and ranged between 31-42mg/day and 53-70mg/day respectively (Table 2). When analysis of virus

109

replication in clarified lung homogenates were assessed on viral RNA yields (as measured using

110

quantitative real time RT-PCR assay), significant differences with groups of untreated animals, ranging

111

between 0.7 and 2.5 log10, were observed only with the higher dose of favipiravir (p≤0.012). Once

112

again, this difference was more noticeable with lower doses of virus (Figure 2b). Since we found higher

113

reductions of infectious titers than those observed with viral RNA yields, we estimated the relative

114

infectivity of viral particle (i.e. the ratio of the number of infectious particles over the number of viral

115

RNA molecules). Decreased infectivity was observed in all treated groups of animals. These differences

116

were always significant with the higher dose of favipiravir (p≤0.031) and were significant with the dose

117

of 37.5mg/day TID for animals infected with 105 or 104 TCID50 of virus (p≤0.041). We then measured

118

plasmatic viral loads using quantitative real time RT-PCR assay and found, with the higher dose of

119

favipiravir and the groups of animals infected with 106 or 104 TCID50, significant reductions of 2.1 and

120

2.62 log10, respectively (p≤0.022) (Figure 2b).

133

In a second set of experiments, we assessed, over a period of 7 days, the impact of treatment on the

134

clinical course of the disease using weight loss as the primary criterion (Figure 3a). Beforehand, we

135

evaluated the toxicity of the three doses of favipiravir with groups of four non-infected animals treated

136

from day 0 to day 3 (Figure 3b). High toxicity was observed with the dose of 75mg/day TID with

137

significant weight loss noticed from the first day of treatment (Table S4). We also found a constant,

138

but moderate, toxicity with the dose of 37.5mg/day TID that was significant at day 4 and 5 only. No

139

toxicity was detected with the lower dose of favipiravir. To assess if the toxicity observed with the

140

highest dose of favipiravir was exacerbated by the infection, we compared weight losses of infected

141

and non-infected animals treated with the dose of 75mg/day TID. Regardless of the dose of virus, no

142

significant difference was observed at 1, 2 and 3 dpi (Figure S3). After this evaluation of favipiravir

143

toxicity, we intranasally infected groups of 10 animals with two doses of virus (105 or 104 TCID50).

144

Treatment with a dose of 37.5mg/day TID was initiated on the day of infection (preemptive antiviral

145

therapy) and ended at 3 dpi (Figure 3a). With both doses of virus, treatment was associated with

146

clinical alleviation of the disease (Figure 3c-d). With the dose of 105 TCID50, mean weights of treated

147

animals were significantly higher than those of untreated animals at 5 and 6 dpi (p≤0.031). Similar

148

observations were made with the dose of 104 TCID50 at 5, 6 and 7 dpi (p<0.0001).

significant difference between treated and untreated animals with a p-value <0.0001 and ranging between 0.01-

157

0.05 respectively (details in Table S2 and S4).

158

In a third set of experiments, treatment was started one day before infection (preventive antiviral

159

therapy) and ended at 2 dpi. We intranasally infected groups of 6 animals with 104 TCID50 of virus and

160

viral replication was measured in lungs and plasma at 3 dpi (Figure 4a). Once again, an inverse

161

relationship was observed between lung infectious titers and the dose of favipiravir (Figure 4b). Mean

162

infectious titers for groups of animals treated with 37.5 and 75mg/day TID were significantly lower

163

than those observed with untreated groups (p≤0.002). Of note, undetectable infectious titers were

164

found for all animals treated with the higher dose. Estimated ED90 and ED99 were 35 and 47mg/day

165

respectively (Table 2). Significant reductions of viral RNA yields of 0.9 and 3.3 log10, were observed with

166

animals treated with 37.5 and 75mg/day TID respectively (p≤0.023). Resulting infectivity of viral

167

particle was decreased, with a significant reduction only for the higher dose of favipiravir (p=0.005).

168

Finally, we found significantly reduced plasmatic viral loads with animals treated with 37.5 and

169

75mg/day TID (p≤0.005).

181

Favipiravir pharmacokinetics (PK) in a hamster model

182

We first assessed the PK and lung distribution of favipiravir in a subgroup of uninfected animals. Groups

183

of animals were treated respectively with a single dose of favipiravir administrated intraperitoneally:

184

6.25mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg. In each dose group, we sacrificed 3 animals at specific time points post-

185

treatment (0.5, 1, 5 or 8 hours) for determination of favipiravir in plasma. Drug concentration in lung

186

tissue was determined at 0.5 and 5 hours post-treatment. Subsequently, we assessed the favipiravir

187

concentration after multiple dose in animals intranasally infected with 105 TCID50 of virus. Groups of 9

188

animals received the three doses evaluated for 3 days (Figure 2a): 18.75mg/day, 37.5mg/day and

189

75mg/day TID and were sacrificed at 12-hours after the last treatment dose. Favipiravir was quantified

190

in plasma (n=9) and lung tissue (n=3).

191

Results are presented in Table 3 and Figure S4. The single dose PK analysis showed that the maximum

192

concentration of favipiravir was observed at 0.5 hour at all doses, then plasma drug concentrations

193

decreased exponentially to reach concentrations below 10 µg/ml at 12 hours. Favipiravir PK exhibited

194

a non-linear increase in concentration between the doses. After multiple doses, trough concentrations

195

(12 hours) of favipiravir also exhibited a non-linear increase between doses. The extrapolated 12 hours

196

post-treatment concentrations after a single dose were calculated in order to determine the

197

accumulation ratio. Accumulation ratios were respectively 6, 16 and 21 at the 3 doses, confirming the

198

non-proportional increase between doses. The average concentration after single dose administration

199

over 0 to 12-hour intervals was calculated and the respective values obtained were 10.1 µg/mL, 38.7

200

µg/mL and 100.5 µg/mL for the 3 favipiravir doses.

201

Favipiravir lung concentrations were 1.6 to 2.7-fold lower than in plasma for both administration of

202

single and multiple doses. After a single dose, the mean lung to plasma ratio ranged from 0.37 to 0.62

203

according to the time post-treatment and was similar between the 3 doses of favipiravir at 0.5 hours.

204

A high ratio 5 hours post-treatment was observed at the highest dose (25 mg) with an increase by a

205

factor 1.6 to 1.8 compared with the lower doses. After multiple doses, the lung penetration of

206

favipiravir was confirmed with a mean lung to plasma ratio ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Favipiravir was

207

not detected in the lungs at the lowest dose (18.75 mg/day).

Mutagenic effect of favipiravir

215

To understand which genomic modifications accompanied favipiravir treatment, direct complete

216

genome sequencing of clarified lung homogenates from animals intranasally infected with 106 TCID50

217

of virus and treated with the two highest doses of drug (preemptive antiviral therapy; Figure 2) was

218

performed. Data were generated by next generation sequencing from lung samples of four animals

219

per group (untreated, 37.5mg/day TID and 75mg/day TID). The mean sequencing coverage for each

220

sample ranged from 10,991 to 37,991 reads per genomic position and we subjected substitutions with

221

a frequency ≥1% to further analysis. The genetic variability in virus stock was also analyzed: 14

222

nucleotide polymorphisms were detected of which 5 recorded a mutation frequency higher than 10%

223

(Table S6).

224

In order to study the mutagenic effect of favipiravir, we used the consensus sequence from virus stock

225

as reference and all the mutations simultaneously detected in a lung sample and in virus stock were

226

not considered in the further analysis (1 to 4 mutations per sample, see Table S6). Overall, no majority

227

mutations were detected (mutation frequency >50%), mutations were distributed throughout the

228

whole genome and almost all of them exhibited a frequency lower than 10% (Figure 5a and 5b).

229

Results revealed a relationship between the number of mutations detected per sample and the dose

230

of favipiravir (Figure 5c): the mean number of mutations increased by a factor 2 and 4.8 with groups

231

of animals treated with 37.5 and 75mg/day TID, respectively. The difference is significant only with a

232

dose of 37.5mg/day TID (p=0.029). This increase of the number of mutations is mainly the consequence

233

of the occurrence of a large number of G→A substitutions and, to a lesser extent, C→U substitutions.

234

Consequently, regardless of the dose of favipiravir, mean frequency of G→A substitutions was

235

significantly increased by a factor of 4.2 (p≤0.009). This rise of these transition mutations led to

236

increased frequency of all transition mutations (significant only at dose of 37.5mg/day TID; p=0.037)

237

and increased frequency of non-synonymous mutations (significant only at dose of 75mg/day TID;

238

p=0.009) (Figure 5d). We investigated whether or not effectiveness in treated animals was linked with

239

the characteristics of the mutations detected on viral populations and found that frequency of non-

240

synonymous, synonymous and G→A mutations were associated with infectious titers in lungs (p<0.03;

241

Figure 5e). Finally, our experiments revealed some parallel evolution events; 32 substitutions in viral

242

sub-populations were detected in two independent animals. Notably, 18 of these shared mutations

243

were detected only with treated animals, 14 of them being non-synonymous (Table S8). These

244

mutations are located in nsp2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, N protein, Matrix, ORF 3a and 8. At this stage, one cannot

245

conclude if these substitutions reflect the adaptation to the hamster model or are the result of the

246

antiviral selection.

Discussion

262

In the current study, we used a hamster model to assess efficacy of the favipiravir against SARS-CoV-

263

2. Following infection, viral RNA was mainly detected in lungs, blood, and, to a lesser extent, in the

264

large bowel. Peak of viral replication was observed at 2-3 dpi followed by observation of significant

265

weight losses, in line with recently reported investigations that involved 6-10 weeks old hamsters

266

(Kaptein et al., 2020, Chan et al., 2020). Clinically, the main symptom was weight loss, observed from

267

the first day of infection and followed by recovery at 6dpi. This confirmed that the in vivo model, with

268

younger animals (4 weeks-old), is suitable for preclinical evaluation of antiviral compounds against

269

SARS-CoV-2.

270

Using a preemptive strategy, we demonstrated that doses of favipiravir of around 700-1400mg/kg/day

271

TID reduced viral replication in lungs of infected animals and allowed clinical alleviation of the disease.

272

Reduction of viral replication was greater when estimated on the basis of infectious titers than on total

273

viral RNA as previously observed in non-human primates treated with Remdesivir (Williamson et al.,

274

2020). However, the effective doses of favipiravir were higher than those usually used in rodent models

275

(≈100-400mg/kg/day) (Sidwell et al., 2007, Smither et al., 2014, Julander et al., 2009, Tani et al., 2018,

276

Oestereich et al., 2016, Yamada et al., 2019). This can be correlated with the high favipiravir EC50 found

277

in vitro for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, effective doses were associated with significant toxicity in our

278

hamster model. This observed toxicity reflected only the adverse effects of favipiravir and was not

279

exacerbated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, similar weight losses were measured among

280

infected and non-infected animals treated with the highest dose of favipiravir at 1, 2 and 3dpi.

281

In the present study, reduction of viral replication was correlated with the dose of favipiravir

282

administrated and inversely correlated with the dose of virus inoculated. In a recent study, favipiravir

283

administrated per os twice daily (loading dose of 600mg/kg/day followed by 300mg/kg/day) revealed

284

a mild reduction of lung viral RNA yields using a similar hamster model with high doses of virus (2x106

285

TCID50) (Kaptein et al., 2020). These results are in accordance with ours at the lower dose of favipiravir

286

(around 340mg/kg/day TID).

287

By characterizing the dose response curve, we estimated that the dose required to reduce by 90%

288

(ED90) the level of infectious titers in lungs is in the range of 570-780mg/kg/day. In the most favourable

289

situation, where high doses were used as a preemptive therapy, favipiravir led to undetectable viral

290

replication in lung and plasma. These results showed that the use of high doses of favipiravir could

291

expand its in vivo spectrum against RNA viruses.

292

With influenza viruses, favipiravir acts as a nucleotide analogue. It is metabolized intracellularly to its

293

active form and incorporated into nascent viral RNA strands. This inhibits RNA strand extension and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775; this version posted July 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

294

induces abnormal levels of mutation accumulation into the viral genome (Baranovich et al., 2013,

295

Sangawa et al., 2013). Recently, it was shown in vitro that favipiravir has a similar mechanism of action

296

with SARS-CoV-2 through a combination of chain termination, reduced RNA synthesis and lethal

297

mutagenesis (Shannon et al., 2020). Our genomic analysis confirmed the mutagenic effect of favipiravir

298

in vivo. Indeed, we found that favipiravir treatment induced appearance of a large number of G→A

299

and C→U mutations into viral genomes. This was associated to a decrease of viral infectivity probably

300

because alteration of the genomic RNA disturb the replication capacity. Similar findings were described

301

in vitro and in vivo with other RNA viruses (Baranovich et al., 2013, Guedj et al., 2018, Escribano-

302

Romero et al., 2017, Arias et al., 2014). Of note, we also observed a strong inverse association between

303

infectious titers in lungs and the proportion of non-synonymous mutations detected in viral

304

populations. Because random non-synonymous mutations are more deleterious than synonymous

305

mutations (Cuevas et al., 2012), this suggests that they were randomly distributed over the three

306

positions of the codons and that no compensatory mechanism was triggered by the virus to eliminate

307

them (i.e. negative selection). Finally, the inverse correlation between lung infections titers and the

308

frequency of G→A substitutions showed that an increased proportion of these mutations beyond an

309

error threshold might be expected to cause lethal mutagenesis.

310

Genomic analyses revealed that 18 mutations detected in viral sub-populations were shared only with

311

treated animals. Two of them were located in the nsp14 coding region involved in the proof-reading

312

activity of the viral RNA polymerisation (Eckerle et al., 2007, Ferron et al., 2018). However, they were

313

located in the N7 MTase domain involved in viral RNA capping (Chen et al., 2013, Ma et al., 2015). By

314

comparison, resistance mutations selected against Remdesivir in β-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus

315

model were obtained in the RdRP (nsp12) coding sequence (Agostini et al., 2018). Further

316

investigations are needed to assess the impact of these mutations on the antiviral effect of favipiravir.

317

Favipiravir PK in our hamster model displayed a non-linear increase in plasma exposure between the

318

doses as already reported in nonhuman primates (Madelain et al., 2017). The observed favipiravir

319

concentration versus time profiles were in agreement with previous results of a PK study performed

320

in 7-8 week-old hamsters orally treated with a single dose of 100mg/kg of favipiravir (Gowen et al.,

321

2015). The maximum plasma drug concentration occurred at 0.5 h after oral administration, earlier

322

than in humans, and then decreased rapidly in agreement with its short half-life (Madelain et al., 2016).

323

After repeated doses, plasma exposure confirmed non-linear PK over the entire range of doses, further

324

emphasized by accumulation ratios. The important accumulation observed at the highest dose could

325

explain in part the toxicity observed in hamsters at this dose. Favipiravir undergoes an important

326

hepatic metabolism mainly by aldehyde oxidase producing an inactive M1 metabolite and inhibits

327

aldehyde oxidase activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These properties explain

328

the self-inhibition of its own metabolism as observed in our study in which the highest dose of

329

favipiravir led to a greater increase in favipiravir concentrations (Madelain et al., 2020).

330

A good penetration of favipiravir in lungs was observed with lung/plasma ratios ranging from 35 to

331

44% after repeated doses, consistent with its physicochemical properties. Lung exposure was also in

332

accordance with previous studies (Gowen et al., 2015).

333

How clinically realistic are these results? To address this question we compared the drug

334

concentrations obtained in the hamster model with those obtained in patients. In 2016, a clinical trial

335

evaluated the use of favipiravir in Ebola infected patients (Sissoko et al., 2016). The dose used in Ebola

336

infected patients was 6000mg on day 0 followed by 1200mg BID for 9 days. The median trough

337

concentrations of favipiravir at Day 2 and Day 4 were 46.1 and 25.9µg/mL, respectively. This is within

338

the range observed here in hamsters treated with the highest dose (around 1400mg/kg/day), with a

339

mean trough concentration of 29.9µg/mL. However, additional investigations are required to

340

determine whether or not similar favipiravir plasma exposure in SARS-COV-2 infected patients are

341

associated with antiviral activity. The major differences in PK between hamster and humans, and the

342

toxicity observed at the highest doses in our animal model limits the extrapolation of our results.

343

Therefore, whether safe dosing regimens in humans may achieve similar plasma exposure and

344

recapitulate the profound effect on viral replication is unknown. Further, the intracellular

345

concentration of the active metabolite was not determined and which parameter of the drug

346

pharmacokinetics best drives the antiviral effect remains to be established.

347

In summary, this study establishes that high doses of favipiravir are associated with antiviral activity

348

against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster model. The better antiviral efficacy was observed using a

349

preventive strategy, suggesting that favipiravir could be more appropriate for a prophylactic use. Our

350

results should be interpreted with caution because high doses of favipiravir were associated with signs

351

of toxicity in our model. It is required to determine if a tolerable dosing regimen could generate similar

352

exposure in non-human primates, associated with significant antiviral activity, before testing a high

353

dose regimen in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, subsequent studies should determine if an increased

354

antiviral efficacy can be reached using favipiravir in association with other effective antiviral drugs,

355

since this strategy may enable to reduce the dosing regimen of favipiravir. Finally, this work reinforces

356

the need for rapid development of animal models to confirm in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds

357

and accordingly, to determine appropriate dose regimens in humans before starting clinical trials.

Methods

379

Cells

380

VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37) were grown at 37°C with 5% CO2 in

381

minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS),

382

1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% non-essential amino acids (all from ThermoFisher Scientific).

383

Virus

384

All experiments with infectious virus were conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory. SARS-CoV-2

385

strain BavPat1, supplied through European Virus Archive GLOBAL (https://www.european-virus-

386

archive.com/), was provided by Christian Drosten (Berlin, Germany). Virus stocks were prepared by

387

inoculating at MOI of 0.001 a 25cm2 culture flask of confluent VeroE6 cells with MEM medium

388

supplemented with 2.5% FBS. The cell supernatant medium was replaced each 24h hours and

389

harvested at the peak of infection, supplemented with 25mM HEPES (Sigma), aliquoted and stored at

390

-80°C.

391

In vitro determination of EC50, EC90, CC50 and infectious titer reductions

392

One day prior to infection, 5×104 VeroE6 cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates (5×104 cells/well

393

in 100µL of 2.5% FBS medium (assay medium). The next day, seven 2-fold serial dilutions of favipiravir

394

(Courtesy of Toyama-Chemical; 0.61µg/mL to 78.5µg/mL, in triplicate) were added (25µL/well, in assay

395

medium). Eight virus control wells were supplemented with 25µL of assay medium and eight cell

396

controls were supplemented with 50µL of assay medium. After 15 min, 25µL of virus suspension,

397

diluted in assay medium, was added to the wells at an MOI of 0.01 or 0.001 (except for cell controls).

398

Three days after infection, cell supernatant media were collected to perform TCID50 assay (at

399

concentration of 78.5, 39.3, 19.6µg/mL), as described below, in order to calculate infectious titer

400

reductions and cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Blue reagent (Promega) following

401

manufacturer’s intructions. Fluorescence (560/590nm) was recorded with a Tecan Infinite 200Pro

402

machine (Tecan). The 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50, EC90) were determined using

403

logarithmic interpolation (% of inhibition were calculated as follows: (ODsample-ODvirus control)/(ODcell control-

404

ODvirus control)). For the evaluation of CC50 (the concentration that induced 50% cytoxicity), the same

405

culture conditions were set as for the determination of the EC50, without addition of the virus, then

406

cell viability was measured using CellTiter Blue (Promega). CC50 was determined using logarithmic

407

interpolation.

In vivo experiments

409

Approval and authorization

410

In vivo experiments were approved by the local ethical committee (C2EA—14) and the French

411

‘Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche et de l’Innovation’ (APAFIS#23975) and

412

performed in accordance with the French national guidelines and the European legislation covering

413

the use of animals for scientific purposes. All experiments were conducted in BSL 3 laboratory.

414

Animal handling

415

Three-week-old female Syrian hamsters were provided by Janvier Labs. Animals were maintained in

416

ISOcage P - Bioexclusion System (Techniplast) with unlimited access to water/food and 14h/10h

417

light/dark cycle. Animals were weighed and monitored daily for the duration of the study to detect the

418

appearance of any clinical signs of illness/suffering. Virus inoculation was performed under general

419

anesthesia (isoflurane). Organs and blood were collected after euthanasia (cervical dislocation) which

420

was also realized under general anesthesia (isofluorane).

421

Hamster Infection

422

Anesthetized animals (four-week-old) were intranasally infected with 50µL containing 106, 105 or

423

104 TCID50 of virus in 0.9% sodium chloride solution). The mock group was intranasally inoculated with

424

50µL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.

425

Favipiravir administration

426

Hamster were intra-peritoneally inoculated with different doses of favipiravir. Control group were

427

intra-peritoneally inoculated with a 0.9% sodium chloride solution.

428

Organ collection

429

Organs were first washed in 10mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution and then transferred to a 2mL or

430

50mL tube containing respectively 1mL (small/large bowel pieces, kidney, spleen and heart) or 10mL

431

(lungs, brain and liver) of 0.9% sodium chloride solution and 3mm glass beads. They were crushed

432

using a the Tissue Lyser machine (Retsch MM400) for 5min at 30 cycles/s and then centrifuged 5min à

433

1200g. Supernatant media were transferred to a 2mL tube, centrifuged 10 min at 16,200g and stored

434

at -80°C. One milliliter of blood was harvested in a 2mL tube containing 100µL of 0.5M EDTA

435

(ThermoFischer Scientific). Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,200g and stored at -80°C.

436

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays

437

To avoid contamination, all experiments were conducted in a molecular biology laboratory that is

438

specifically designed for clinical diagnosis using molecular techniques, and which includes separate

439

laboratories dedicated to perform each step of the procedure. Prior to PCR amplification, RNA

441

(both from Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Shortly, 100 µl of organ clarified

442

homogenates, spiked with 10µL of internal control (bacteriophage MS2) (Ninove et al., 2011), were

443

transferred into an S-block containing the recommended volumes of VXL, proteinase K and RNA carrier.

444

RT-qPCR (SARS-CoV-2 and MS2 viral genome detection) were performed with the Express one step RT-

445

qPCR Universal kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) using 3.5µL of RNA and 6.5µL of RT-qPCR mix that contains

446

250nmol of each primer and 75nmol of probe. Amplification was performed with the QuantStudio 12K

447

Flex Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the following conditions: 50°C for 10min,

448

95°C for 20s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 3s, 60°C for 30s. qPCR (ɣ-actine gene detection) was

449

perfomed under the same condition as RT-qPCR with the following modifications: we used the Express

450

one step qPCR Universal kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and the 50°C step of the amplification cycle was

451

removed. Primers and probes sequences used to detect SARS-CoV-2, MS2 and ɣ-actine are described

452

in Table S9.

453

Tissue-culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay

454

To determine infectious titers, 96-well culture plates containing confluent VeroE6 cells were

455

inoculated with 150μL per well of serial dilutions of each sample (four-fold or ten-fold dilutions when

456

analyzing lung clarified homogenates or cell supernatant media respectively). Each dilution was

457

performed in sextuplicate. Plates were incubated for 4 days and then read for the absence or presence

458

of cytopathic effect in each well. Infectious titers were estimated using the method described by Reed

459

& Muench (REED and MUENCH, 1938).

460

Favipiravir pharmacokinetics

461

Animal handling, hamster infections and favipiravir administrations were performed as described

462

above. A piece of left lung was first washed in 10mL of sodium chloride 0.9% solution, blotted with

463

filter paper, weighed and then transferred to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.9% sodium chloride

464

solution and 3mm glass beads. It was crushed using the Tissue Lyser machine (Retsch MM400) during

465

10min at 30 cycles/s and then centrifuged 5min à 1200g. Supernatant media were transferred to 2mL

466

tubes, centrifuged 10 min at 16,200g and stored at -80°C. One milliliter of blood was harvested in a

467

2mL tube containing 100µL of 0.5M EDTA (ThermoFischer Scientific). Blood was centrifuged for 10 min

468

at 16,200g and stored at -80°C.

469

Quantification of favipiravir in plasma and lung tissues was performed by a validated sensitive and

470

selective validated high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry

471

method (UPLC-TQD, Waters, USA) with a lower limit of quantification of 0.1 µg/mL. Precision and

472

accuracy of the 3 quality control samples (QCs) were within 15% over the calibration range (0.5 µg/mL

473

to 100 µg/mL) (Bekegnran et al., submitted). Favipiravir was extracted by a simple protein precipitation

474

method, using acetonitrile for plasma and ice-cold acetonitrile for clarified lung homogenates. Briefly,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775; this version posted July 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

475

50 µL of samples matrix was added to 500µL of acetonitrile solution containing the internal standard

476

(favipiravir-13C,15N, Alsachim), then vortexed for 2min followed by centrifugation for 10min at 4°C.

477

The supernatant medium was evaporated and the dry residues were then transferred to 96-well plates

478

and 50 µL was injected. To assess the selectivity and specificity of the method and matrix effect, blank

479

plasma and tissues homogenates from 2 control animals (uninfected and untreated) were processed

480

at each run. Moreover, the same control samples spiked with favipiravir concentration equivalent to

481

the QCs (0.75, 50 and 80 µg/mL) were also processed and compared to the QCs samples.

482

Noncompartemental analysis conducted using software Pkanalix2019R2 (www.lixoft.com). Areas

483

under the plasma concentration time curve were computed using medians of favipiravir

484

concentrations at 0.5, 1, 5 and 8 hours, and extrapolated until T=12h. Ctrough were extrapolated at

485

T=12h using lambda-z loglinear regression on the decreasing slope of concentrations.

486

Sequence analysis of the full-length genome

487

200µL of lung clarified homogenate or infectious cell supernatant (virus stock) was inactivated with an

488

equal volume of VXL lysis buffer (Qiagen) and viral RNA was extracted using an EZ1 Advanced XL robot

489

with the EZ1 mini virus 2.0 kit (both from Qiagen) and linear acrylamide (ThermoFisher Scientific) in

490

place of carrier RNA. cDNA was generated in a final volume of 40µL using 14µL of nucleic acid extract,

491

random hexamer and the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). A

492

specific set of primers (Table S10) was used to generate thirteen amplicons covering the entire genome

493

with the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR mixes (final volume 25µL)

494

contained 2.5µL of cDNA, 2µL of each primer (10µM) and 12.5 µL of Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix.

495

Amplification was performed with the following conditions: 30 sec at 98°C, then 45 cycles of 15 sec at

496

98°C and 5 min à 65°C. Size of PCR products was verified by gel electrophoresis. For each sample, an

497

equimolar pool of all amplicons was prepared and purified using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (New

498

England Biolabs). After DNA quantification using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer

499

(ThermoFisher Scientific), amplicons were fragmented by sonication into fragments of around 200bp

500

long. Libraries were built by adding barcodes, for sample identification, and primers using AB Library

501

Builder System (ThermoFisher Scientific). To pool equimolarly the barcoded samples a quantification

502

step by real time PCR using Ion Library TaqMan Quantitation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) was

503

performed. Then, emulsion PCR from pools and loading on 530 chip was performed using the

504

automated Ion Chef instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sequencing was performed using the S5 Ion

505

torrent technology v5.12 (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. Consensus

506

sequence was obtained after trimming of reads (reads with quality score <0.99, and length <100pb

507

were removed and the 30 first and 30 last nucleotides were removed from the reads). Mapping of the

508

reads on a reference (determine following blast of De Novo contigs) was done using CLC genomics

509

workbench software v.20 (Qiagen). A de novo contig was also produced to ensure that the consensus

510

sequence was not affected by the reference sequence. Mutation frequency for each position was

511

calculated as the number of reads with a mutation compared to the reference divided by the total

512

number of reads at that site. Only substitutions with a frequency of at least 1% were taken into account

513

for the analysis (Table S6).

514

ED50, ED90 and ED99 determination

515

We conducted a nonlinear regression of infectious viral load against dose, using an Emax model, giving

516

𝑉𝐿 = 𝑉𝐿0 × (1 − (

517

𝐷50 the dose required to decrease viral load by 50%, using a coefficient 𝛾 to account for the high

518

sigmoidicity of the relation between dose and titers. 𝛾 coefficient was chosen as the one maximizing

519

𝛾
likelihood of the model. We extrapolated the 𝐷90 and 𝐷99 using 𝐷90 = √9 × 𝐷50 and 𝐷99 =

520

𝐷𝛾

𝛾
𝐷 𝛾 +𝐷50

)) with 𝑉𝐿0 being infectious viral load of untreated animals. We estimated

𝛾

𝛾

𝛾
√99 × 𝐷50
, as well as their 95% confidence interval using the delta method.

521

Statistical analysis

522

Graphical representations and statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism 7 (Graphpad

523

software) except linear/nonlinear regressions and their corresponding graphical representations that

524

were performed using R statistical software (http://www.R-project.org). Statistical details for each

525

experiments are described in the figure legends and in corresponding supplemental tables. P-values

526

lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
