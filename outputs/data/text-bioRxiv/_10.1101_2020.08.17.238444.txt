Abstract
The human microbiota has a close relationship with human disease and it remodels
components of the glycocalyx including heparan sulfate (HS). Studies of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest
that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a
codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS
and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change
with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode
HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of
key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age
in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible
mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial
glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike
binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human
microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could
predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community
composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and
diagnosis of susceptibility.

Introduction
All living cells are coated with a dense forest of glycans and glycoconjugates called the
glycocalyx. Many viral pathogens have evolved mechanisms to attach to host glycans in order to
bind to tissues and pass through the glycocalyx to engage protein receptors in the plasma
membrane required for cell entry (Cagno et al., 2019). Of these, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Lang et al., 2011), dengue (Chen et al., 1997), human
papillomavirus (Giroglou et al., 2001), hepatitis B (Schulze et al., 2007), herpes simplex virus
(Spear et al., 1992), human immunodeficiency virus (Connell and Lortat-Jacob, 2013), and
others, target heparan sulfate (HS), a highly negatively charged linear polysaccharide present on
the surface of all mammalian cells (Esko and Selleck, 2002). Infection by SARS-CoV-2, the
causative agent of COVID-19, can be blocked with the HS derivative heparin (Kim et al., 2020;
Mycroft-West et al., 2020; Clausen and Sandoval et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 attachment and
infection requires binding to both HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via distinct
regions of the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Clausen and Sandoval et al., 2020). Reducing the
interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host-cell HS is therefore an attractive
approach to reduce viral docking and subsequent infection.
Several bacterial taxa produce enzymes that modify specific classes of the
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family, including HS, and much of GAG research has been advanced
using purified bacterial enzymes (Linhardt et al., 1986). Polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) are
co-localized and co-regulated genes responsible for complex carbohydrate detection and
degradation in bacteria (Grondin et al. 2017). PULs have been annotated in Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron (human gut isolate; Cartmell et al., 2017; Ndeh et al., 2020; Ulmer et al., 2014)
and Flavobacterium heparinum (soil isolate; Galliher et al., 1981). These PULs allow the

bacteria to degrade and catabolize many complex carbohydrates including HS. The interplay of
bacterial and viral utilization of host glycocalyx GAGs provides a mechanism for transkingdom
interaction (Pfeiffer and Virgin, 2016) through modulation of pathogen adhesion spanning the
eukaryotic host, bacteria in the microbiome, and SARS-CoV-2. Removal of cell-surface HS via
heparin lyase (HSase) purified from F. heparinum effectively eliminates SARS-CoV-2 virus
infection and spike protein binding (Clausen and Sandoval et al., 2020).
Here we show a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the capacity of the
human microbiome to catabolize HS, a critical host factor involved in mediating SARS-CoV-2
infection. A computational model of HS catabolism was developed to assess the capacity of
human microbes to catabolize HS. HS-modifying bacteria are reduced in patients with COVID19. Moreover, the microbial HS-modifying capacity is reduced with age, and enriched in females
compared to males, both major COVID-19 susceptibility factors. Finally, evidence shows that
common commensal bacteria have the capacity to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding by
degrading host HS. These results suggest that differences in human microbiome composition
may influence SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and help explain the observed sex and age-associated
heterogeneity of COVID-19 rates across populations.

Results
Common human-associated microbes possess a high capacity for HS modification
Bacteria rely on host glycans for binding, immunological recognition, and as an energy
source (e.g. carbon and nitrogen catabolism). For this purpose, bacteria produce a variety of
enzymes encoded in PUL capable of degrading the complex glycans making up the host cell
glycocalyx. PUL have been annotated in hundreds of bacterial genomes, providing insights into

the carbohydrates each species can catabolize (Terrapon et al., 2015, 2018). These activities have
also been formulated in a computational modeling platform to simulate PUL activity (Eilam et
al., 2014). As a further generalization of PUL estimation beyond comprehensive genome
annotation or mechanistic modeling, we used a pathway-based approach by modeling catabolism
of each major glycan as a metabolic task in order to predict bacteria involved in catabolism of
HS (Richelle et al., 2018, 2019, 2020).
Recent work demonstrated the necessity of HS for SARS-CoV-2 cellular binding and
efficient infection (Fig. 1A) (Clausen and Sandoval et al., 2020), suggesting that the microbial
HS catabolic capacity in the native human gut microbiome might affect infection. We curated a
metabolic task (i.e. a group of catabolic reactions necessary to transition between metabolites
(Richelle et al., 2020)) that describes HS modification (Fig. 1B). Using this task, we quantified
the total counts aligned to each glycosylation-associated gene in each microbe in the FINRISK
2002 dataset, a fecal shotgun metagenomic dataset spanning over 6,000 samples from
participants ranging from 25–74 years old (Borodulin et al. 2015; Salosensaari et al., 2020).
These counts allowed us to calculate HS catabolic “capacity” (a continuous measure of aggregate
gene abundance within a pathway to estimate the amount of flux an organism can pass through
the pathway) and “completeness” (binary indication of the presence or absence of all HScatabolism genes in a microbe) (Fig. 1C). Specific inclusion criteria for HS modification genes
and HS catabolic measures are described in Materials and Methods. Of the 7,490 species
identified in the FINRISK 2002 dataset 463 species of bacteria, which we refer to as HSmodifying bacteria, contained the complete HS catabolic (completeness=1) task with high HS
catabolic capacity (capacity>90th percentile). Three Bacteroides species, B. xylanisolvens, B.
thetaiotaomicron and B. vulgatus, were predicted to have extremely high capacity (99th

percentile) for HS catabolism consistent with prior reports (Cartmell et al., 2017; Ndeh et al.,
2020; Ulmer et al., 2014).

HS-modifying bacteria are reduced in COVID-19 patients
Based on the prevalence of bacteria that can potentially catabolize HS, we hypothesized
that their presence within the microbiome might naturally limit HS-binding sites for SARS-CoV2 and that the prevalence of bacteria encoding these genes might associate negatively with
COVID-19 susceptibility (Graphical Abstract). To test this hypothesis, we explored the
prevalence of predicted HS-modifying bacteria in COVID-19 patient samples. Human and
SARS-CoV-2 reads were filtered out of previously published RNA-Seq datasets from 33
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from adult COVID-19 (n=13) and healthy control
(n=20) subjects (Shen et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2020) to obtain microbial reads (Poore et al.,
2020). Gene expression from HS-modifying bacteria (N-strains numerator = 239, denominator =
1851) was decreased in COVID-19 compared to healthy control samples (Fig. 2A). Microbial
RNA-Seq reads coding for heparin lyase (class I, II, & III) (Fig. 2B), and N-acetylglucosamine6-O-sulfatase (Fig. 2C), both HS-modifying enzymes, were also reduced in COVID-19 patients
compared to healthy controls. These differences were not explained by variation between the two
datasets included (Fig. S1). These findings suggest that COVID-19 patients have altered lung
microbiomes that may favor SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Bacteria with capacity for HS modification decrease with age
To determine if HS-modifying bacteria could reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
we explored their prevalence across age and sex, two established COVID-19 risk-factors. Strong

age and sex disparities in SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility has been reported across
numerous populations, with adults twice as likely to be infected as those under the age of 20
(Davies et al., 2020) and men having higher risk than females (Williamson et al., 2020).
Microbial communities age naturally and predictably with their human hosts in a sex-dependent
manner (McDonald et al., 2018; de la Cuesta-Zuluaga et al., 2019; Claesson et al., 2011; Huang
et al., 2020; Koenig et al., 2011), suggesting that aging and sex may be associated with a
reduction in HS-modifying bacteria.
To test this hypothesis, we measured the prevalence of HS-modifying bacteria across age
for both men and women in the FINRISK 2002 study. The log-ratio of bacteria predicted to
catabolize HS versus all other bacteria (N-strains numerator = 687, denominator = 5987)
decreased with age and in men compared to women as did the normalized abundance of bacterial
HS-modifying genes (Fig. 3A-B, Table S1). This finding was validated in an independent
dataset by mapping the Web of Life (WoL) microbial genomes (Zhu et al., 2019) to 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from over 20,000 samples in the American Gut Project
(AGP), a citizen-science dataset with participants ranging in age from 1-80 years (McDonald et
al., 2018). A similar age and sex-dependent decrease in HS-modifying bacteria was observed (Nstrains numerator = 244 & denominator = 1605) (Fig. 3C).
Additional risk factors for COVID-19 identified in the OpenSAFELY study (Williamson
et al., 2020) including diabetes, smoking, BMI, cancer, asthma, liver fibrosis or cirrhosis,
cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases were not observed to have significant changes by HSmodifying bacterial abundance in the FINRISK 2002 dataset (Table S1). The alpha diversity of
both the AGP and FINRISK datasets exhibited a previously observed plateau after the age of 40
and an increase in women over men between the ages of 30 to 60 (de la Cuesta-Zuluaga et al.,

2019; Fig. S2A&B). Alpha diversity and HS-modifying bacteria had a weak negative correlation
for both men and women in the AGP and FINRISK datasets (Table S2).

Common human gut commensal bacteria are capable of degrading HS.
To provide more direct evidence for our hypothesis, in vitro experiments were conducted
to test the catabolic capacity of human microbiome species to degrade HS. Axenic cultures of B.
ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron, highly prevalent human gut bacterial isolates known to
catabolize HS (Cartmell et al., 2017) found in 80% of AGP and 99% of FIRNISK 2002
participants, were grown on minimal medium in the presence of heparin (100 µM) with and
without glucose (22 mM). Both species were able to grow with heparin as the sole carbon source
and electron donor (Fig. 4A-B). Furthermore, all cultures were verified to catabolize heparin in
culture by comparing the concentration of heparin in the medium before and after stationary
growth (Fig. 4C-D). Cell-surface HS on H1299 human lung cells was reduced by 60% upon
exposure to cell-free supernatants from mid-log phase cultures of B. ovatus or B.
thetaiotaomicron compared to 100% reduction by purified heparin lyase from Flavobacterium
heparinum (F. hep. HSase; IBEX pharmaceuticals), as measured by binding of the anti-HS
monoclonal antibody 10E4 (Fig. 4E).
To determine the effect of bacterial HS modification on SARS-CoV-2 binding, H1299
human lung cells were treated with the supernatant of Bacteroides cultures or purified F. hep.
HSase, and then incubated with biotinylated trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and assessed
cell-surface binding by flow cytometry. Cells treated with Bacteroides culture supernatant
caused a significant reduction (20-30 fold) in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to cells
incubated with Bacteroides culture supernatants compared to untreated H1299 cells (B. ovatus t-

statistic = 31.25, p-value = 7.019 x 10-5; B. thetaiotaomicron t-statistic = 30.99, p-value = 7.023 x
10-5), similar to the reduction observed by pre-treatment with purified Hsase (t-statistic = 23.89,
p-value = 7.59 x 10-5) (Fig. 4F).

Discussion
We provide evidence for a role of the human microbiome in mediating SARS-CoV-2
infectivity via modification of the host glycocalyx. HS-modifying bacteria, identified in the
human gut microbiome, were depleted in BALF of COVID-19 patients. Although no protective
mechanism has been demonstrated yet, HS-modifying Bacteroides strains have previously been
shown to be more frequent in healthy controls compared to COVID-19 patients (Trottein and
Sokol, 2020; Zuo et al., 2020). B. ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron can catabolize cell-surface HS
and block SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding. In two independent gut microbiome datasets, we
observed reduced HS-modifying bacteria, including Bacteroides, with increasing age and in men
compared to women, which may help explain increased susceptibility to COVID-19 among men
and older populations. Finally, we showed experimentally that B. ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron
can catabolize cell-surface HS and block SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding.
Human-associated microbes, including the Bacteroides species tested here, may alter
viral infectivity in other ways. For example, ACE2, the plasma membrane receptor necessary for
viral uptake, was downregulated in germ-free mice mono-colonized by B. ovatus or B.
thetaiotaomicron (Fig. S3, Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017). Bacteroides species, including B. ovatus
and B. thetaiotaomicron, have previously been found to be negatively associated with host age
(Galkin et al., 2020). Recent work has demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of SARSCoV-2, unlike previous SARS-like coronaviruses, must be pre-activated by the proprotein

convertase furin to effectively bind ACE2 (Walls et al., 2020, Hoffman 2020). Certain bacteria
can also produce furin-like proteases and may provide another layer of regulation on top of hostproduced furin proteases (Pavlova 2019). More generally, the effect of the microbiome on
immune system development and decay has been widely documented (Thaiss et al., 2016), and
may also influence an individual’s susceptibility to COVID-19.
We observed in the FINRISK 2002 dataset that non-modifiable COVID-19 predisposing
factors such as host age and sex exhibit differences by bacterial HS-modification. Other risk
factors such as diabetes identified in the OpenSAFELY project (Williamson et al., 2020) showed
no clear trends by HS-modification. This highlights a possible critical role for microbial
modulation in populations with non-modifiable risk factors, while other factors may be more
accessibly modified by treating underlying metabolic imbalances. Furthermore, microbial
communities obtained from other body sites such as saliva may also alter viral susceptibility in
similar ways. For example, the human oral microbiome from the AGP dataset demonstrated an
age dependent change in HS-modifying bacteria similar to the gut microbiome samples (Fig.
S4). However, there are not comparably large oral microbiome datasets which could be used to
explore other risk factors.
Positioned at the cell-environment interface, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), like HS, play
critical roles in intercellular and host-pathogen interactions ranging from peptide exchange to
migration (Weiss et al., 2017). Removal of critical molecules like HS may mitigate SARS-CoV2 infection, but their depletion could also result in the loss of its endogenous function, for
example in signaling reactions and tissue repair processes. Further studies are required to
determine the target sulfation pattern for SARS-CoV-2 binding, but our results suggest that Nacetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfatase is decreased in the microbial populations present in COVID-19

patients. Activation of host 6-O-sulfotransferases decreased spike protein binding and
dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissue culture (Clausen and Sandoval et al.,
2020), suggesting that 6-O-sulfation of HS may provide a more specific target to disrupt the
SARS-CoV-2/HS interaction without broad degradation of host cell surface or extracellular
matrix HS.
This report provides evidence for the role of glycocalyx-microbiota interactions as a
novel competitive mechanism in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Additional work will clarify and
quantify the translational implications for microbial modulation of host GAGs and SARS-CoV-2
infectivity. It remains unclear which specific microbial enzymes modify GAGs to interrupt
SARS-CoV-2 binding, and whether these enzymes can be exploited to limit the spread of the
virus during an active infection. Additionally, the role of the respiratory tract microbiome, which
has a strikingly different microbial community and functional repertoire from the gut
microbiome (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Beck et al., 2015; Lloyd-Price et
al., 2017), remains to be explored. The analyses presented here describe a key mechanism by
which host microbiomes might play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, provide a potential
explanation for health disparities among age groups in COVID-19 disease and highlight the
importance of characterizing the potential future molecular arms race between humans and
viruses. Exploration of the vast interplay between host-microbes and viral infection could allow
for improved risk stratification, prevention, and intervention.

The HS modification gene set is a metabolic task, i.e. a group of reactions necessary to
transition between metabolites (Richelle et al., 2020) used to describe a complete pathway of HS
modification. Pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, ec00531,
(Kanehisa et al., 2017)), in combination with literature annotation of these pathways for specific
bacteria (Hobbs et al., 2018; Robb et al., 2017; Ndeh et al., 2017), were used to identify reactions
(enzyme commission (EC) numbers) associated with the modification task. (Table S3) Finally,
we used CAZy, dbCAN, and CUPP (Barrett and Lange, 2019; Lombard et al., 2014; Yin et al.,
2012; Zhang et al., 2018) to map EC numbers to microbial genes associated with glycan
modification (Table S3).
We created two metrics to describe the HS-catabolic capabilities of microbes. For each
microbe in the FINRISK2002 dataset, we estimated pathway “Completeness,” a binary
indication of the presence or absence of all genes in the task, and pathway “Capacity,” a
continuous indication of the magnitude of flux that could travel through the task. Expression of
genes associated with glycan catabolism were quantified by the total number of reads (total
count) mapped between the HS-modification gene set and FINRISK 2002 sample shotgun data
through Bowtie2. A pseudocount was added to each count and log-transformed,
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 + 1), to stabilize variance.
HS-catabolic completeness (𝐸- ) for each organism, i, with gene, g, is an indication that all
reactions in a task are represented in an organism. Specifically, for each reaction (EC) in the HS
task, we sum the log-counts aligned to glycosylation-related genes within an organism associated
with that EC. If the sum of log counts aligned to an EC exceeds a threshold, t, the EC was
marked as active in that organism. The threshold, t, was set at the 5th percentile of log-counts

To quantify the HS-catabolic capacity (𝐴- ) of each organism, i, with genes, g, we analyzed the
expression of all glycosylation-related genes within the catabolic task. Adapted from metabolic
task analysis (Richelle et al., 2018, 2019, 2020), the catabolic capacity of a microbe is a contextsensitive measure that accommodates rate-limiting or low-abundance enzymes and can therefore
accommodate microbial gene transience. Activation of the glycan degrading metabolic task
(Richelle et al., 2020), was calculated as the minimum EC activation; the maximum activation of
genes performing the EC reaction within an organism. Log of total counts was used to stabilize
variance. The capacity is the minimum EC activation in a pathway where EC activation is the
maximum gene activity score for each EC within a microbe. The log of total counts aligned to
each gene in the FINRISK 2002 dataset was used for the gene activity score:

Differential abundance or expression of HS-modifying bacteria was determined by the

modification relative to those without predicted capacity. Functional gene abundance or
expression was determined with a log-ratio of the total mapped reads to that gene relative to the
sum of counts of total mapped reads from a set of housekeeping genes in each sample. The

dnaJ, gyrA, gyrB, infB, pheS, proC, rpoA ,rpoB, and rpoD obtained from RefSeq (Pruitt et al.,
2007). Significance between groups of log-ratios was determined with an unpaired t-test though
SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020).

COVID-19 RNA-Seq dataset
Previously, COVID-19 metatranscriptomes have been analyzed for microbial taxonomy
and function (Shen et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020; Haiminen et al. 2020). RNA-Seq data from two
separate studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Shen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) were
downloaded from the National Genomics Data Center (Project Accession PRJCA002202) and
NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (Project Accession PRJNA605983). Human and SARS-CoV-2
reads were filtered out by aligning reads to the human genome (Genome Reference Consortium
Human Build 38) (Church et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2017) and SARS-CoV-2 genome using

Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with the fast-local parameter set, following the protocol
described by Poore et al. In the case of paired-end reads, forward and reverse reads files were
treated as unpaired. Reads were aligned to the Web of Life database of 10,575 bacterial and
archaeal genomes using Shogun (Hillmann et al., 2018) in the Bowtie2 alignment mode.
Alignments were summarized into taxonomic profiles at the phylum, genus, and species level
using the classify function in the Web of Life (Zhu et al., 2019).

Mapping of WoL to AGP 16S ASVs
To reconcile the evolutionary relationships among 16S rRNA gene sequencing amplicon
sequence variants (ASV) and shotgun metagenomic data, we mapped the ASVs to the “Web of
Life” (WoL) (Zhu et al., 2019) reference phylogeny of bacterial and archaeal genomes. First, 16S
rRNA genes were annotated from each of the 10,575 genomes included in the phylogeny using
RNAmmer 1.2 (Lagesen et al., 2007), using domain-specific models (bacteria and archaea,
respectively). Second, filtered 150 bp length 16S V4 American Gut Project (McDonald et al.,
2018) ASVs (n=15,486) were aligned to the WoL 16S rRNA genes using BLASTn 2.7.1+
(Altschul et al., 1990), with an e-value threshold of 1e-5 and up to 100 target sequences per
query. Top hits with identical bit scores of each query were retained and subjected to taxonomic
classification. At each designated rank, taxonomic assignments of all top hits were recorded. For
feature table generation, the hits were counted and normalized by the total number of hits. As an
example, assuming one ASV aligned equally well to five reference full-length 16S sequences,
and they belong to genus A (two sequences) and genus B (three sequences), then the two genera
were counted as 2/5 (A) and 3/5 (B), respectively. Per-query counts were summed across each
AGP sample and rounded to integers.

Cultivation of Bacteroides strains
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides ovatus were cultured in 50 mL anaerobic
brain heart infusion (BHI) medium with overnight incubation at 37°C in an anaerobic serum
bottle. The next day, 1 mL of cells from the BHI culture were washed in anaerobic PBS and were
passed into 15mL of minimal medium containing no carbon sources or electron donors other
than glucose (22 mM final) and/or heparin (1 mg/mL final). Growth on the minimal medium was
measured by optical density at 600 nm every 12 hr. Aliquots of 3 mL of culture were taken
before inoculation, immediately after inoculation, at mid-log phase (24 hr), and in stationary
phase (45 hr). Heparin degradation in culture was measured through a Blyscan
glycosaminoglycan assay (Biocolor Ltd., Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland) using 100 µL of time
0- and 45-hr culture media. All cultivation and HS-modification experiments were conducted in
triplicate.
To verify strain taxonomy a 1 mL aliquot of each culture was extracted using PowerFecal
DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio cat. 12830). Extracted DNA was quantified via Qubit™ dsDNA HS
Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 5 ng of input DNA was used in a 1:10 miniaturized Kapa
HyperPlus protocol (Sanders et al., 2019). The pooled library was sequenced as a paired-end
150-cycle run on an Illumina NovaSeq at the UCSD IGM Genomics Center. Resulting sequences
were adapter trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) and human read filtered
with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Paired-end reads were merged using Flash
v1.2.11 (Magoč and Salzberg, 2011). Each axenic sample was assembled through SPAdes
(Bankevich et al., 2012) and verified through average nucleotide identity (Lee et al., 2016) of

greater than 99% between the assembled genome and the putative type-strain genome obtained
from NCBI (Pruitt et al., 2007).

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein production
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encoding residues 1-1138 (Wuhan-Hu-1;
GenBank: MN908947.3) with proline substitutions at amino acids positions 986 and 987 and a
“GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (amino acids 682-682), was produced in ExpiCHO
cells by transfection of 6 x106 cells/ml at 37 ºC with 0.8

g/ml of plasmid DNA using the

ExpiCHO expression system transfection kit in ExpiCHO Expression Medium (ThermoFisher).
One day later the cells were refed, then incubated at 32 ºC for 11 days. The conditioned medium
was mixed with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Recombinant protein was
purified by chromatography on a Ni2+ Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (1 ml, GE LifeSciences).
Samples were loaded in ExpiCHO Expression Medium supplemented with 30 mM imidazole,
washed in a 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 30 mM imidazole and 0.5 M NaCl.
Recombinant protein was eluted with buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.3 M imidazole. The
protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200,
prep grade. GE LifeSciences) in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 M NaCl.

Biotinylation
For binding studies, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was conjugated with EZLinkTM Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (1:3 molar ratio; Thermo Fisher) in Dulbecco’s PBS at room
temperature for 30 min. Glycine (0.1 M) was added to quench the reaction and the buffer was
exchanged for PBS using a Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher).

SARS-CoV-2 spike binding experiments
NCI-H1299 from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in RPMI medium
containing 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate under an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells at 50-80% confluence were lifted in 10 mM EDTA in
PBS (Gibco) and washed in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Cells were seeded into a 96 well plate at
105 cells per well. The cells were then treated with 2.5 mU/mL Flavobacterium heparinum
HSase I, 2.5 mU/mL Flavobacterium heparinum HSase II, and 5mU/mL Flavobacterium
heparinum HSase III (IBEX Pharmaceuticals) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA (100 µL) or 100 µL
Bacteroides ovatus and thetaiotaomicron minimal media culture cell-free supernatant
supplemented with 10% BSA) for 30 min at 37 °C. A portion of the cells was treated with
HSase mix for 30 min at 37°C in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were washed twice in
PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were then stained with 20 µg/mL biotinylated S protein
(S1/S2) or 1:1000 Anti-HS (Clone F58-10E4) (Fisher Scientific, NC1183789) in PBS containing
0.5% BSA, for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed twice and then stained with StreptavidinCy5 (Thermo Fisher) at 1:1000 (S protein) or Anti-IgM-Alexa488 at 1:1000 (Anti-HS) in PBS
containing 0.5% BSA, for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed twice and then analyzed using a
FACSCanto instrument (BD bioscience). Data analysis was performed in FlowJo and statistical
analyses were done in Prism 8.

Graphical Abstract. Diagram of hypothesis for bacterial mediation of SARS-CoV-2
infection through heparan sulfate (HS). It is well known that host microbes groom the mucosa
where they reside. Recent investigations have shown that HS, a major component of mucosal
layers, is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we examine the impact of microbial
modification of HS on viral attachment.

Figure 1. Prediction of bacterial capacity for modification of heparan sulfate (HS). Multiple
studies have demonstrated microbial grooming of mucosal surfaces while separate studies have
demonstrated the reliance of viruses on mucosal quality and quantity. Recently reliance on
specific forms of HS, a major mucosal component, was demonstrated in SARS-CoV-2 (A). Here,
we examine the abundance of HS-modifying genes in microbes measured in the FINRISK 2002
dataset and aggregate across the modification pathway to quantify the HS catabolic capacity of
abundant microbes (B). Bacterial tree of life colored by superphylum groups and phyla
containing predicted HS-modifying species. The bar chart represents the predicted capacity for
HS modification of each species colored by phyla (C).

Figure 2. Bacteria species encoding heparan sulfate (HS) lyase (HSase) are depleted in
COVID patients compared to controls. BALF RNA-seq data from healthy subjects (control)
and COVID-19 patients (COVID) (x-axes) compared by log-ratios (y-axes) of predicted HSmodifying species relative to non-HS-modifying (A), HSase relative to housekeeping set (B),
and N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfatase relative to housekeeping set (C). Significance was

female (black) and male (gray). All log-ratio plots annotated by the number of subjects at that
time point. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Presented p-values and test
statistics are from unpaired two-tailed t-test evaluated on each host age group between host sex.

Figure 4. HS-modifying bacteria degrade HS and reduce SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
binding when applied to human lung cells. Growth of Bacteroides ovatus (A) and Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron (B) measured by optical density (y-axis) across time from inoculation (x-axis)

heparin (blue), or minimal media with 100 µM heparin (red). Comparison of heparin
