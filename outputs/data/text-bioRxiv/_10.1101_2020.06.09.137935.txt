Abstract
Despite the worldwide efforts to avoid disease progression of COVID-19 into a severe acute
respiratory syndrome and avoid its severe impact on health systems; the situation remains critical.
Effective diagnosis, treatment, and prophylactic measures are required to meet the worldwide
demand: recombinant antibodies such as alpaca Nanobodies fulfill these requirements. Here, we
develop a fast track for nanobody isolation against the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) SARSCoV-2 Spike protein following an optimized immunization, efficient construction of the VHH library
for E. coli surface display, and single-step selection of high-affinity nanobodies using a simple
density gradient centrifugation of the bacterial library. Following this procedure, we isolate and
characterize an alpaca Nanobody against Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in the sub-nanomolar
range.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the name given by the World Health Organization to the
illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, a novel coronavirus identified in China that is related to
pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction, constituting an unprecedented threat to health and
economy worldwide (1-4). Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs that can effectively contain
the pandemic, and to flatten the curve and avoid the collapse of health systems, nonpharmacologic public health measures such as social distancing, border closures, and lockdowns
have been enforced globally (5, 6). Genetic studies determined that the pathogen responsible for

this outbreak belongs to the Coronaviridae family, genus Beta-coronavirus, sub-genus
sarbecovirus (7). It has high sequence homology with the bat coronavirus RaTG13, providing
evidence that the new virus may have originated in bats (8).
The SARS-CoV-2 sequence contains 29903bp, which includes 14 open reading frames (ORFs)
coding for the replicase ORF1ab, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N)
structural proteins, and several non-structural (nsps) and accessory proteins (9, 10). The Spike
on the surface of the virus is responsible for the attachment and invasion of host cells (11). Spike
is a highly glycosylated trimeric class I fusion protein and contains two subunits, S1 and S2 (12).
CryoEM studies showed that it remains in a metastable pre-fusion conformation with a hinge-like
movement of the S1 subunit, which attaches by the Spike receptor binding domain to host cells
that express the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. After attachment, the S1
sheds and leaves the S2 subunit in a stable post-fusion conformation. The latter mediates
membrane fusion and is responsible for the invasion of the host cell (13, 14).
The ACE2 appears to be the molecular entryway to the host (13, 15-17), as the SARS-CoV-2
Spike binds to this receptor. The virus requires priming proteolysis by the TMPRRS2 serine
protease, which attacks a furin-like cleavage site on the S protein. The conformational change
then stabilizes the complex, allowing the virus to infect the host cell (18, 19). The presence of
ACE2 has been confirmed in different tissues (20-22), that are related to clinical manifestations of
COVID-19 (23). This mechanism mediated by S glycoprotein highlights the importance of this
protein as a target for the development of therapies such as neutralizing antibodies and vaccines
(24-28). In this sense, isolation of specific antibodies could be instrumental in the development of
effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools against the virus.
Some naturally occurring antibodies that lack light chains are known as single-domain antibodies
(HCAb). They are derivates of IgG and occur in the entire camelidae family (29). The camelidae
family comprises of camels, dromedaries, llamas, vicuñas, guanaco, and alpacas (30). The
antigen-binding fragment of an HCAb contains a single variable VHH domain consisting of 3

hypervariable regions. When isolated, the VHH domain is also known as a Nanobody. Nanobodies
can be used as therapeutic bullets against tumors, pathogens, and chronic diseases (31-33).
Nanobodies are in general more stable than conventional antibodies and their expression is
efficient in the periplasm. In fact, several milligrams can be produced from one liter of culture (31,
34-37). More novel strategies using Nanobodies as intrabodies to target specific proteins for
selective degradation might allow the therapeutic ablation of intracellular targets (38-40).
Nanobodies derived from camelid HCAbs are obtained after immunization with the target protein
plus adjuvant. Our platform has developed an improved procedure for the production of
Nanobodies using Alpacas as donor species. To isolate the genetic sequences of the targetspecific Nanobodies produced after immunization, peripheral blood B-lymphocytes are isolated to
obtain total RNA, followed by cDNA preparation to finally amplify the Nanobody region (41). The
cDNA fragment encoding the Nanobody is as short as 360nt, and up to ~ 3x106 single clones can
be obtained from 120 mL blood: a safe and harmless procedure for our alpacas. Afterward, a
bacterial display system was used to clone the full single Nanobodies. Here, we report an
optimized, fast, efficient, inexpensive and simple density gradient method for Nanobody selection,
and a sub-nanomolar affinity Nanobody against the Spike receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2.

Results
The process of classic nanobody generation and selection takes months. For instance, full
immunization requires on average 8 weeks, and the process also comprises the construction of
the Nanobody library and affinity selection of clones, which can take an additional 6 months. Here
we show a method to fast track immunization of an alpaca with the full-length Spike of SARSCoV-2. We obtained the lyophilized protein raised in a baculovirus expression system. Previous
to immunization, protein integrity was tested by SDS-Page and Coomassie staining (Figure 1a).
Then, an alpaca called Buddha (Figure 1b) was immunized twice over 14 days with 100 µg of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.137935; this version posted June 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

full Spike protein. The animal´s health was monitored throughout the study period by clinical
examination, hematology analysis, and serum biochemistry. The immune response of the
alpaca´s serum before immunization revealed a fortunate basal cross-reaction against the Spike
protein, and after the second immunization, we observed a significant increase of IgG antibodies
in the alpaca´s serum. This was done in a rapid qualitative manner by Dot blot analysis,
immobilizing the epitope to a nitrocellulose membrane and using alpaca serum as a source of
primary antibodies (Figure 1c). We also detected IgG antibodies by ELISA using the full Spike
protein immobilized to the plate with the alpaca´s serum as a source of primary antibodies (Figure
1d). The Bacterial Display system takes advantage of the high-efficiency of transformation of E.
coli and avoids the need of bacteriophage infections or shuttling into yeast cells for surface display
of the Nanobodies (42). Importantly, this Nanobody display system can drive the specific adhesion
of E. coli bacteria to abiotic and cellular surfaces with the cognate antigen (43, 44). Thus, we
rapidly constructed a bacterial display library with a complexity of 2.3 x106 independent clones
was quickly achieved by a electroporation of E. coli DH10B-T1R strain with 0.7% religation of the
vector(44-46) (see Materials and Methods).
We applied a novel procedure for the selection of Nanobodies based on a simple Ficoll density
gradient, an inexpensive reagent available all around the world used for blood fragmentation. We
were inspired by the main observation that red cells accumulate at the bottom of the Ficoll density
gradient, while PBMCs stay in the upper fraction. Using conventional NHS-activated Sepharose
beads in a Ficoll gradient, we found that the density of the beads was sufficient to precipitate to
the bottom of a 15mL tube. Further, the same assay was performed with free bacteria, and as
expected the bacteria remained in the upper fraction. Since a single Nanobodies type is expressed
by every bacterium of the library(42). In the bacteria display system used, E. coli bacteria express
upon IPTG-induction intimin-Nanobody protein fusions that anchor in the outer membrane and
expose the functional Nanobody to the extracellular milieu for antigen recognition. These intiminNanobodies fusions also contain a common epitope (myc-tag) at the C-terminus for

immunodetection (45). Therefore, we hypothesized that bacteria expressing specific Nbs on their
surface would bind NHS-beads coated with the protein of interest (i.e. Spike SARS-CoV-2) and
will migrate all the way through to the bottom of the Ficoll density gradient, leaving unbound
bacteria in the upper fraction (Figure 1e). Indeed, we demonstrated that specific Nanobodies from
a bacterial display library can be rapidly and inexpensively selected with our protocol using
common reagents and a conventional centrifuge. A full description is provided in the Methods
section.
We optimized conditions to extract the

intimin-Nanobody fusions from the bacterial outer

membrane and used these protein extracts directly for assaying binding to Spike protein applying
two different methods: Dot blot analysis and high-content microscopy: For Dot blot analysis and
High-content microscopy. After nanobody selection using our simple Ficoll based density gradient
protocol, we obtained ~ 1000 colonies on LB-agar plates from the Sepharose-antigen coated
fraction. 100 colonies were analyzed, the bacteria were inoculated in liquid LB media and further
induce the expression of intimin-Nanobody of single clones. Bacterial pellets were lysed under
optimized conditions and the extract was used as a source of Nanobodies -as primary antibodiesfor the second binding screening. For Dot blot analysis a negative control of an unrelated protein
was applied next to the same amount of full-length Spike on the nitrocellulose strips. Single Dot
blot strip tests were incubated with the bacterial extracts containing Nanobodies. Nanobodies
binding to Spike were unveiled by sequential incubation with mouse anti-myc antibody and an
anti-mouse HRP-conjugate. Of the first 100 clones, we focus on two strongly bound to the fulllength Spike in the Dot blot analysis (W23UACh and W25UACh). Furthermore, we used high
content microscopy as a second confirmation method. Therefore, a single 10 cm-plate was
transfected with a Spike-GFP vector for 24h, and cells were seeded onto 96 well-plates. After 24
hours, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and individual extracts of our 100 selected bacterial
display clones were incubated as a source of Nanobodies. Nanobodies were myc tagged after
incubation with a mouse anti-myc antibody and an anti-mouse Alexa647 secondary antibody was

used for immunofluorescence assays. HeLa cells had a transfection efficiency of ~20%. In this
case, a low transfection rate is desired because it allows us to evaluate unspecific binding to untransfected cells in the same image. Consistent with the Dot blot analysis, the W23UACh and
W25UACh Nanobodies bound to the Spike-GFP expressed in human cells (Figure 2b). We
observed colocalization of W23UACh and W25UACh to Spike-GFP, while no colocalization was
observed with negative control extracts (Figure 2b). We also observed that W25UACH does not
bind to the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 tagged to a GFP protein (Supplemental Figure-1b):
confirming that W25UACh binds specifically to Spike and not to GFP. The selected clones were
sequenced and the alignment of the amino acid sequences showed a high similarity between the
two nanobodies, CDR3 was exactly the same in both antibodies, therefore we concluded the two
nanobodies are members of the same family and were most likely generated from a common
origin during the Alpaca´s immunoreaction against the Spike protein (Figure 2c). Here we have
presented a method that rapidly performs secondary screening selection of Nanobodies, using
bacterial extracts from selected clones of the bacterial display library, using either conventional
biochemical methods such as Dot blot analysis or high content microscopy immunofluorescencebased assays.
After cloning the W25UACh nanobody into the pHen6 vector for periplasmic bacterial expression
large amounts of purified W25UACh nanobody were obtained (Supplemental Figure-1c & 1d). We
demonstrated a direct interaction between the Spike RBD and the W25UACh nanobody by
pulldown assay, with pure recombinant RBD protein or BSA protein as a control. The above were
covalently immobilized to NHS-Sepharose beads, further binding to W25UACh was tested to RBD
and control beads, and we showed that the selected W25UACh nanobody binds to RBD (Figure
3a). The purified W25UACh nanobody was used for immunofluorescence of HeLa cells transiently
transfected with a Spike tagged to a GFP vector in Figure 3b. The W25UACh nanobody
specifically recognized the Spike-GFP in a sensitive manner (Figure 3b), given that we observed
colocalization of Spike-GFP and W25UACh to ruffles in HeLa cells (Figure 3b). Thus, our

experiment suggests the use of the W25UACh nanobody as a measure for the direct diagnosis of
infected cells by immunofluorescence. We demonstrated proper folding of the RBD domain and
the nanobody using a label-free Tycho measurement, yielding inflection temperatures (Ti) of
52.4°C and 57.9°C which is indicative of thermal stability. Mixing the RBD domain with the
nanobody led to strong thermal stabilization of the RBD domain at around 14°C, thus confirming
the tight interaction between the RBD domain and the nanobody (Figure 3c). To finally quantify
the interaction affinity between the RBD domain and W25UACh, Microscale Thermophoresis
(MST) was applied. The MST experiment resulted in an affinity of W25UACh for the RBD domain
of 295 ± 84 pM (Figure 3d). Thus, our procedure using simple gradient selection can select subnanomolar affinity Nanobodies against the RBD domain of the Spike of SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
Currently selection of nanobodies from bacterial display is performed by affinity purification based
on magnetic beads binding the labelled antigen or by FACS Sorter or selection on cells transfected
with the antigen (46). Herein, we describe a novel simple method for the selection of Nanobodies
from E. coli bacterial display libraries. Our method used only conventional laboratory instruments
and an inexpensive Ficoll gradient for the selection of Nanobodies from a highly complex and
diverse bacterial library. The success rate depends on the immune response of the alpaca to the
epitope. Nevertheless, which in this case could have been unwittingly aided by prior undetermined
exposure to cross-reactive camelid coronaviruses (47-49). Nevertheless, here we have shown a
successful example based on an immunization program of two week´s duration and 100 clones
analysis; thus, our methods can accelerate the identification of nanobodies, enabling the
generation of diagnostic and potentially therapeutic measures against Covid-19 and other
infectious and emergent viruses.

The medical, social, and economic consequences of COVID-19 impact the lives of everyone on
the planet and while vaccines and effective therapies are not available, sensitive diagnostic tools
are urgently needed. Currently, convalescent plasma transfusion has been applied as an
emergency treatment for COVID-19, aiming to enhance the immune response of the patients (50,
51). In the late phase of disease progression, an inflammatory cytokine storm has been reported.
Antibody administration at this stage by convalescent plasma transfusion is under discussion,
especially for critically ill patients (52). Nanobodies might become an alternative for
immunotherapy to replace or complement convalescent plasma transfusion. Here we
characterized the affinity properties of novel Nanobodies against the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2. We demonstrated that W25UACh could be suitable for diagnostic and pathology studies since
it can detect Spike expressed in human cells, the yield of production of W25UACh is high and
inexpensive; several milligrams of the Nanobody can be obtained from a single liter of bacterial
culture as shown in the Supplemental Figure 1C. Using fast thermal denaturation, we were able
to determine the folding of RBD and W25UACh with a Ti of 52.4°C and 57.9°C, respectively. Clear
evidence of binding between these two proteins is the Ti shift to 66.8°C, stabilizing at ~14°C:
further determined by Thermophoresis that the Nanobody W25UACh affinity for the RBD domain
of Spike is KD ~295 ± 84 pM. The other three research groups have been reported Nanobodies
against Spike RBD: VHH 72 with an Kd of 39nM (53), Ty1 with an Kd of 8 ± 1.5 nM at normal salt
conditions (54), and a large set over eighteen humanized single-domain antibodies, across the
selected antibodies the highest affinity was shown by the clone n3021 Kd of 0.63 ±0.01 nM. Thus,
to date the monomeric W25UACh Nanobody reported here shows the highest affinity for the Spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2, however further experiments are needed to determine whether
W25UACh can also neutralize the infection of cells by disrupting the interaction of Spike RBD to
the ACE2 cellular receptor.

In a nutshell, we provide a powerful method to accelerate the generation of Nanobodies against
pathogens and a sub-nanomolar affinity nanobody obtained against the Spike protein of SARSCoV-2.

Material and Methods
Immunization and VHH library construction
The alpaca immunization process followed the protocol the guidelines established by the Bioethics
Committee of the Austral University of Chile certifications 338/2019 and 388/2020. One day before
immunization, 5 mL of blood was collected for pre-immune serum tests. For immunization (day 1),
100 µg of full-length Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (SINOBiological) was used. The cold
lyophilized protein was dissolved in 2 mL of adjuvant (Veterinary Vaccine Adjuvant, GERBU
FAMA) diluted 1:1 in sterile water and injected subcutaneously into a male alpaca (Vicugna
pacos). A total volume of 4 mL was injected into four different locations in the alpaca. A 5 mL blood
sample was collected seven days after the first immunization. On day 14, the alpaca was
immunized again with 100 µg Spike, and on day 15 a sample of 120 mL blood was collected from
the jugular vein in tubes containing 3.8% sodium citrate as an anti-coagulant. The uncoagulated
blood sample was mixed with the same volume of HBSS medium without calcium (Gibco), divided
into aliquots of 10 mL and each aliquot was added on top of a 5 mL of Ficoll-Paque Premium (GE
Healthcare) in 15 mL sterile Falcon tubes. After centrifugation (1.200 × rpm, 80 min, RT), the
PBMC fraction was recovered from the interphase, washed twice in PBS by centrifugation (3.500
× rpm, 10 min), resuspended in 4 mL of sterile PBS (Gibco). RNA extraction and cDNA production
were performed using the commercial RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription

Kit

(Qiagen)

respectively

according

instructions.

Approximately 2 µL of each cDNA synthesis procedure were used as templates in 50 µL PCR
reactions with oligonucleotides CALL001 (5´-GTC CTG GCT CTC TTC TAC AAG G-3´) and
CALL002 (5´-GGTACGTGCTGTTGAACTGTTCC- 3´)(55). The amplified fragments of ∼0.6 kb,

corresponding to VHH-CH2 domains, and ∼0.9 kb, corresponding to conventional VH-CH1-CH2
domains, were separated in 1.2% (w/v) low melting agarose gels and the ∼0.6 kb band was
purified (QIAEX II Gel Extraction kit, Qiagen). This fragment was used as a template in a second
PCR reaction with oligonucleotides VHH-Sfi2 (5´-GTC CTC GCA ACT GCG GCC CAG CCGGCC
ATG GCT CAG GTG CAG CTG GTG GA-3’) and VHH-Not2 (5´- GGA CTA GTG CGG CCG CTG
AGG AGA CGG TGA CCT GGG T-3´) to finally obtain the amplified fragments of ∼0.4 kb,
corresponding to VHH domains. The amplified VHH fragments were digested with SfiI and NotI
(Thermo Scientific) restriction enzymes and ligated into the same sites of the purified vector
pNeae2 (46). Ligations were electroporated in E. coli DH10B-T1 R cells obtaining a library size of
∼3 × 106 individual clones, as determined by plating on LB-Chloramphenicol agar plates with 2%
w/v glucose incubated at 30°C. Less than 0.7% of re-ligated vectors were estimated from a control
ligation performed in parallel without the DNA insert. Transformed bacteria were scraped from
plates and stored at -80°C in LB broth with 30% glycerol.

Coupling epitopes to beads
1 mL of NHS-activated sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads were washed with 2 mL of cold 1 mM HCI
immediately before use, then washed 5 times with cold sterile PBS. 200 µg of purified protein in
PBS 1X was added to the beads and incubated with rotation overnight. Non-reacted groups in the
medium were blocked by adding ethanolamine to a final concentration of 0.5 M. Beads were
washed 5 times with PBS and stored at 4°C.

ELISA Assay
10 ng of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein diluted in PBS 1X pH 7,4 were bound in each well of the
ELISA Plate, incubated at 37°C for 1h. Followed by a 3 x 5 min wash with PBS-T(PBS 0.1%
Tween20). Serial dilutions (1:5000in PBS 1X) of Pre and Post immunization serum were
incubated at 37°C for 1h. Followed by a 3 x 5 minutes wash with PBS-T. Secondary detection

was done with peroxidase-labeled anti- Llama IgG (1:5000 in PBS-T), followed by a 3 x 5 min
wash with PBS-T and visualized using 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA (THERMO), 5 min at 37°C.
Signal was measured at 650nm in a microplate reader after 10 min incubation.

Density gradient separation
1 mL of glycerol stock from the library was inoculated in a flask containing 20 mL of LB medium
with 25 μg/mL of chloramphenicol and 2% glucose. The flask was incubated (pre-inoculum)
overnight at 37ºC with 200 rpm agitation. The same procedure was repeated with control bacteria
that were transformed with a kanamycin resistant plasmid (negative control). The pre-inoculum
was pelleted and resuspended in LB medium with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol and then diluted to
0.02 OD600 in 100 mL of fresh LB medium with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol without glucose,
incubated at 37ºC with 200 rpm agitation until it reached 0.45 - 0.6 OD600. IPTG was added to a
final concentration of 50 µM to induce protein expression for 3 hours at 30ºC and 200 rpm. OD600
absorbance of library and control bacteria cultures was measured. 50 mL of both cultures was
washed three times with 10 mL of filtered PBS. Centrifugation was always performed at 3000 x g
for 5 min. Libraries culture (chloramphenicol resistant) and the negative control (kanamycin
resistant) were resuspended in a final volume of 10 mL PBSX. 2 mL of library culture and 2 mL of
negative control cultures were mixed (if final OD600nm were same, if not the volume of the control
bacteria was adjusted based on OD in order to add an equal amount of bacteria) and incubated
with 300 µL of NHS beads coupled to epitope protein on a 15 mL conical tube on a rocking platform
for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was slowly added on the top of 6 mL of Ficoll (FicollPaqueTM PLUS GE Healthcare) in a 15 mL conical tube, centrifuged at 200 x g for 1 min. The
unbound fraction was discarded (upper fractions), leaving a visible pellet of beads that was
resuspended in 4 mL PBS and rotated for 5 min at room temperature. This step was repeated six
times. Finally, 1 mL of LB medium was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, then
50 μL were plated on LB agar plates with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 2% glucose, 50 μL were plated

on LB agar plates with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 2% glucose and the rest in at least two LB
chloramphenicol/glucose agar plates, incubated at 37ºC overnight (>20hrs recommended). The
colony number of the first two plates were counted as a measurement of specific enrichment of
Nanobodies expressing bacteria from the library.

Expression, sub-cloning and purification of Nanobodies
The selected VHH cDNA fragments were digested with SfiI and NotI (Thermo Scientific) restriction
enzymes and ligated into the same sites of the purified vector pHen6 (56). For periplasmic
expression the E. coli wk6 strain was used, the pHen6-W25UACh vector was transformed and a
single clone was selected from the agar plates and inoculated in 20 mL of liquid LB-medium
containing 100μg/ml ampicillin and glucose 1%. The bacteria were cultured at 37 °C with agitation
for 16 h. The cells were then diluted into 1L Terrific Broth (TB) medium containing 100μg/ml
ampicillin, 2mM MgCl2, 0,1% glucose and grew at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6–0.9. The expression
of the nanobodies was induced by adding 1 mM of IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside)
for 20h at 28 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C. The harvested
cells were resuspended in a 12 mL TES buffer (0.2 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose)
and incubated for 1h on ice, then incubated for another hour on ice in a 18 mL TES buffer, diluted
4 times and centrifuged at 8000 rpm at 4°C to pellet down cell debris. The supernatant was loaded
on 5mL of HisPur Ni-NTA agarose resin which was pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (Tris
50mM, NaCl 500 mM, imidazole 10 mM pH 7,5). The lysed cells containing His tagged nanobodies
were added to the column followed by adding the column´s volume in binding buffer for a total of
8 times. The column was washed by adding 8-fold the column´s volume with wash buffer (Tris
50mM, NaCl 500 mM, imidazole 30 mM pH a 7.5), and eluted with 15mL of elution buffer (Tris
50mM, NaCl 150 mM, 150 mM imidazole, 1mM DTT pH 7.5). Purified nanobodies were verified
by SDS-PAGE Coomassie staining analysis.

In vitro Pulldown assay
100 µL of recombinant W25UACh (1 µg/µL) was incubated with 100 μL NHS-activated sepharose
4 Fast Flow beads coupled to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein plus 800 µL of PBS1x pH 7,4 and
bovine serum albumin coupled beads (negative control) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by
3 x 3 h wash with PBS-T(PBS 0.1% Tween20), 3 x 5 min wash with PBS 500 mM NaCl and 3 x 5
min wash with PBS 1X . The pulled down materials were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer,
separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with coomassie blue. Recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike S1 Protein (RBD) from Trenzyme, Germany was used for the
assays.

Cell culture
HeLa were maintained at 37°C in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 units/mL of
penicillin and streptomycin. Plasmid transfection was performed in 10 cm plates using 25 µg of
DNA, 24h after transfection cells were split into 96 well plate ~10000 cells per well. Transfection
was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and media were supplemented with Normocin during transfection (Invivogen).

Dot Blot analysis screening
Individual colonies obtained from a density gradient separation protocol were inoculated into 2 mL
of LB medium and incubated overnight at 37ºC with 200 rpm agitation. 100 µL of Pre-inoculum
was added to 1.9 mL of fresh LB medium with 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol, incubated at 37ºC with
200 rpm agitation until it reached 0.45-0.6 OD600. To induce protein expression IPTG was added
at a final concentration of 50 µM for 3 h at 30ºC and 200 rpm. The culture was pelleted and
resuspended in 1mL PBS 1X 0.2% TritonX100, sonicated for 10 seconds at 40% on ice, then
centrifuged at 14.000 x g for 30 mins at 4°C and the supernatant was recovered to obtain a total

protein extract from each clone. 1 µl of protein SARS-CoV2 Spike protein (200 ng/uL) and a E.
coli total protein extract were spotted within a pre marked grid onto a 0.2 µm pore–size
nitrocellulose membrane (Merk Millipore). The membrane was left to dry to fix the proteins for 30
min at room temperature. Non-specific sites were blocked with blocking solution (PBS- 0.1%
Tween20 with 5 % bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature with agitation. The
blocking solution was discarded and each membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with agitation at a dilution of 1:10 for the total protein extract of each clone in 5 ml of TBS-T
containing 5% BSA, followed by 3 x 5 min wash with PBS-T. Secondary antibody incubation was
performed with Mouse Anti-Myc antibody (9B11, Cell Signalling) 1:3000 in PBS-T containing 5%
BSA for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 3 x 5 min wash with PBS-T. After this, the membrane
was incubated with a Goat anti mouse IgG antibody coupled to HRP (Invitrogen) 1:5000 in PBST containing 5% BSA, for 1h at room temperature, followed by 3 x 5 min wash with PBS-T and
visualized using the ECL reagent (Pierce).

High content microscopy
Cells were grown on a 96 well optical plate (Themofisher) were washed with PBS 1X 3 times and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. After fixation, cells were washed
with PBS 1X and permeabilized in PBS 0.2% Triton X 100. After washing the cells 3 times in PBS
1X they were then incubated to either extract containing Nanobodies or Purified Nanobodies
during 45 minutes at 37°C, after further washing another 3 times with PBS 1Xa secondary antimyc (Cell Signaling) was used at 1:3000 and incubated during 45 minutes at 37°C. Directly
afterward the cells were washed 3 x times in PBS 1X and incubated with an anti-mouse Alexa 647
during 35 minutes at 37 C. For nuclei staining, cells were washed with PBS 1X and incubated for
10 min at room temperature with 0.1 mg/mL DAPI. After the final wash, cells were maintained in
the 96 well optical plates in 100 uL PBS 1X. Images of fixed cells were acquired with a high content
automatic microscope, Celldiscoverer 7 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany).

Structural integrity and functionality tests using Tycho NT.6.
The binding of W25UACh and the structural integrity of Spike RBD was verified using a label-free
thermal shift assay with Tycho NT.6 (Nanotemper Technologies GmbH) using intrinsic Tryptophan
and Tyrosine fluorescence. 10 µL solutions of Spike RBD (2 µM), W25UACh (2 µM) and Spike
RBD mixed with W25UACh (2 µM each) were prepared and loaded into Capillaries Tycho NT.6
(TY-C001, NanoTemper Technologies GmbH). The Tycho instrument applies a quick thermal
ramp from 35°C to 95°C with a heating rate of 30°C/min and the unfolding of proteins can be
monitored through changes in the 350 nm / 330 nm fluorescence emission ratio. Recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike S1 Protein (RBD) from Trenzyme, Germany was used for the
assays.

Binding affinity measurements using MST.
For the dissociation constant (Kd) between the W25UACh nanobody and SARS-CoV-2 S1, Spike
RBD was measured by microscale thermophoresis (MST) using a Monolith NT.115PICO
instrument (Nanotemper Technologies GmbH). Purified W25UACh was buffer exchanged into a
PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and its concentration was adjusted to 10 µM using UV-absorbance. Next,
W25UACh was fluorescently labeled with the Monolith Protein Labeling Kit RED – NHS 2nd
Generation (MO-L011, NanoTemper Technologies GmbH) following the protocol established in
the manual. Labeled W25UACh was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to eliminate precipitates.
A 16-point serial dilution series of recombinant Spike RBD (250 nM – 7.6 pM) was applied in PBS
buffer containing 0.01% Pluronic F-127 and mixed with a final concentration of 1 nM labeled
W25UACh. Affinity measurements were conducted in Premium Capillaries Monolith NT.115 (MOK025, NanoTemper Technologies GmbH) and repeated three times. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2
(2019-nCoV) Spike S1 Protein (RBD) from Trenzyme, Germany was used for the assays.

A) SDS- Page to ensure protein integrity of full-length Spike of SARS-CoV-2 before immunization.
B) Adult alpaca immunized with Spike. C) Evaluation of the alpaca´s immune response by Dot
blot. Image shows the reaction to decreasing amounts of Spike-1 and Bovine serum albumin
(negative control) using a pre-immunization control, and after one immunization (1 week), or two

antibody source followed by an anti-camelid IgG-HRP secondary antibody. D) ELISA assay before
and after the second immunization (3 weeks). E) Schematic representation of novel protocol for
isolation of Nanobodies using density gradient separation. The bacterial display library expressing
the Nanobodies on the surface of bacteria is briefly incubated with conventional Sepharose beads
coated with the epitope of interest. Directly after the mixture is deposited on a Ficoll gradient conic
tube and centrifuged at 200 x g for 1 min, the beads drive through the gradient to the bottom of
the tube with the bacteria expressing specific Nanobodies, while the unbound bacteria remain on
the surface of the gradient. The beads are then resuspended, and bacterial clones are isolated for
biochemical binding confirmation.
