The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the
RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1-3. The N
protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4.
Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome
transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription
complex (RTC)7-11. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we
show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular
condensates12-15. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on
multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of
these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric
states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer
that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like
compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could
therefore serve as antiviral therapy.
Introduction
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a ~30 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA
genome, packed tightly inside the ~100 nm virion in a poorly-defined structure called the
nucleocapsid16-19. Following viral entry and disassembly of the nucleocapsid, the genome is
translated to produce RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and numerous non-structural proteins
(Nsps)1,20-22.These proteins rearrange membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum to form the
RTC7-11, which is thought to provide a scaffold for the viral proteins that perform genome
replication and transcription, and which might also shield these processes from the host cell’s
innate immune response.
Using genomic (+) RNA as a template, the viral polymerase produces (-) RNA transcripts of
subgenomic regions encoding the four major viral structural proteins (S, E, M, and N)1,20-22.
Subgenomic transcription involves a template-switching mechanism in which the polymerase
completes transcription of a structural protein gene and then skips to a transcription-regulating
sequence (TRS) at the 5’ end of the genome, resulting in subgenomic (-) RNA fragments –
which are then transcribed to produce (+) RNA for translation. N protein is encoded by the most
abundant subgenomic RNA and is translated at high levels early in infection. The N protein is
among the most abundant viral proteins in the infected cell2,3 and accumulates in dynamic

clusters at RTCs11,23-25, where it is thought to help promote the RNA structural rearrangements
required for subgenomic transcription5,26,27.
The structural features of the N protein are well conserved among coronaviruses. The ~46 kDa
N proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are ~90% identical. The N protein contains two
globular domains, the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD), surrounded by intrinsically
disordered regions4 (Figure 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1). N protein is highly basic (pI~10), and
multiple RNA-binding sites are found throughout the protein28. The NTD is an RNA-binding
domain29-32. The CTD forms a tightly-linked dimer with a large RNA-binding groove33-36, and the
fundamental unit of N protein structure is a dimer37,38. Under some conditions, the dimer selfassociates to form oligomers that depend on multiple protein regions33,35,39-44. The biochemical
features and function of these oligomers are not known.
The central disordered linker contains a conserved serine-arginine (SR)-rich sequence that is
likely to serve as a key regulatory hub in N protein function. Early in infection, the SR region is
rapidly phosphorylated at multiple sites by cytoplasmic kinases5,6,45-50. Phosphorylation leads to
association with the RNA helicase DDX1, which promotes RNA structural changes required for
transcription of long subgenomic RNAs in the RTC5. Later in infection, nucleocapsid formation
and viral assembly do not seem to require N protein phosphorylation, which is substantially
reduced in the nucleocapsid of MHV and SARS-CoV virions5,6. We have little understanding of
the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation influences N protein function.
N protein of SARS-CoV-2 forms RNA-dependent biomolecular condensates
To gain a better understanding of N protein structure and function, we explored the
oligomerization of the N protein from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Purified N protein produced in bacteria migrated on gel filtration as a dimer in high
salt but as a large oligomer in physiological salt (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Light microscopy
revealed the presence of liquid-like droplets in the presence and absence of added RNA
(Extended Data Fig. 2b). We noted, however, that purified N protein contained nucleic acid,
even after RNAse treatment, raising the possibility that structures seen in the absence of added
RNA were due to tightly-bound contaminating RNA. Following removal of RNA by protein
denaturation and renaturation, the protein displayed few microscopic structures, but addition of
viral RNA greatly enhanced the formation of structures similar to those in the native preparation

(Fig. 1b). We conclude that RNA is required for the formation of the higher-order oligomers seen
in the microscope. All subsequent studies were performed with denatured and renatured
proteins (Extended Data Fig. 3a).
We first analyzed the effects of three mid-sized viral RNA fragments: (1) 5’-400, containing the
400 nt at the 5’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is thought to include multiple secondary
structure elements and the leader TRS51-53; (2) PS-318, a sequence near the end of ORF1b in
SARS-CoV, proposed as a packaging sequence54,55 but of unknown function51,56; and (3) N1260, containing the open reading frame of the N gene near the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV-2
genome. RNA encoding firefly luciferase (Luc-1710) was a nonviral control. N protein structures
were analyzed by microscopy 30 minutes after addition of RNA at room temperature (Fig. 1b).
At 10 µM N protein, the three viral RNAs rapidly generated branched networks of liquid-like
beads. Higher N protein concentrations produced large liquid-like droplets several microns in
diameter. Nonviral RNA led to amorphous filamentous aggregates with partial liquid-like
appearance.
Incubation at higher temperature (30°C or 37°C) had little effect on droplet formation in a 30minute incubation (Extended Data Fig. 3b), and longer incubations did not transform filamentous
networks into droplets (Extended Data Fig. 3c). High salt dissolved N protein structures,
indicating that they depend primarily on electrostatic interactions (Extended Data Fig. 3d).
N protein structures displayed different features at different ratios of N protein to 5’-400 RNA
(Fig. 1c). At low RNA concentration (0.125 µM), 10 µM N protein formed small spherical
droplets. Higher RNA concentrations led to filamentous structures. At RNA concentrations
approaching that of N protein, no structures were formed. These results suggest that
condensates depend on the crosslinking of multiple N proteins by a single RNA.
We tested the importance of multivalent RNA binding by measuring the effects of a 10nucleotide RNA carrying the TRS sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The TRS sequence is thought to
bind primarily to the NTD, with some contribution from the adjacent SR region57,58. Surprisingly,
addition of the TRS RNA triggered the rapid formation of droplets, without the filamentous
structures seen with longer viral RNAs (Fig. 1b, c). Also in contrast to results with longer RNAs,
droplet formation was greatly reduced when the N protein was in molar excess over the TRS
RNA (Fig. 1b, c), indicating that RNA-free N protein exerts a dominant inhibitory effect on the

formation of TRS-bound oligomers. Droplets formed when TRS RNA was equimolar with or in
excess of N protein (Fig. 1c), suggesting that these droplets depend on binding of a single TRS
RNA to each N protein. Monovalent TRS binding appears to alter N protein structure to enhance
low-affinity protein-protein interactions leading to droplet formation. In the more physiologically
relevant context of long RNAs, these weak protein-protein interactions are presumably
augmented by multivalent RNA-protein interactions.
We next explored the roles of N protein disordered regions. We analyzed mutant proteins
lacking the following regions (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 1): (1) the 44-aa N-terminal extension
(NTE), a poorly conserved prion-like sequence with a basic cluster that contributes to RNA
binding28; (2) the 31-aa SR region, a basic segment implicated in RNA binding,
oligomerization44, and phosphorylation5,6,45-50; (3) the 55-aa C-terminal extension (CTE),
implicated in oligomerization35,42-44; and (4) the CTD basic patch (CBP), a 33-aa basic region
that forms the RNA-binding groove on the surface of the CTD33-35, which can be deleted without
affecting CTD dimer structure36.
When combined with viral 5’-400 RNA, none of the deletions completely prevented droplet
formation at high protein concentrations (Fig. 2a), indicating that no single disordered segment
is essential for the interactions that mediate droplet formation. CTE deletion stimulated the
formation of abundant filaments, suggesting that this region normally inhibits interactions.
Deletion of the NTE or CBP abolished filaments. Droplets were also observed after deletion of
both the NTE and CTE, showing that the central regions are sufficient for droplet formation.
Turbidity analyses (Fig. 2b) showed that full-length N protein structures increased abruptly
between 5 and 10 µM, supporting a cooperative mechanism of oligomer assembly. CTE
deletion reduced the saturating concentration and NTE deletion increased it, further supporting
the negative and positive roles, respectively, of these regions. Deletion of both NTE and CTE
resulted in an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 2b).
Further insights arose in studies of deletion mutants and the 10-nt TRS RNA (Fig. 2a). By
minimizing the contribution of multivalent RNA binding, these studies illuminated critical proteinprotein interactions that contribute to condensate formation. As in the experiments with long
RNA, CTE deletion enhanced droplet formation, NTE deletion abolished it, and the double
deletion had little effect, pointing to these regions as opposing but nonessential modulators of
protein-protein interactions. As in the wild-type protein (Fig. 1b), a molar excess of N protein

suppressed droplet formation by TRS RNA in most mutants; only the CBP deletion caused
abundant droplets when the protein was in excess of RNA, suggesting that the CBP is
responsible for the reduced droplet formation seen with high N protein concentrations. In
contrast to results with long RNA, deletion of the SR region abolished TRS-mediated
condensates (Fig. 2a). TRS binding to the NTD is known to be enhanced by the basic SR
region, but SR deletion has only a moderate impact on affinity57. At the RNA concentration used
in our experiments, it is unlikely that SR deletion abolished RNA binding. We therefore suspect
that the SR region, perhaps in association with part of the RNA, is required for TRS-dependent
droplet formation because it mediates a weak interaction with another N protein44.
Phosphorylation promotes more liquid-like N protein condensates
N protein phosphorylation depends on a poorly understood collaboration between multiple
kinases5,6,49. A central player is the abundant cytoplasmic kinase GSK-3, which generally
phosphorylates serines or threonines four residues upstream of pre-phosphorylated ‘priming’
sites59. Studies of the N protein of SARS-CoV6 support the presence of two priming sites, P1
and P2 (Fig. 3a), where phosphorylation initiates a series of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation
events, each primed by the previous site, resulting in a high density of up to ten phosphates.
The kinases responsible for priming phosphorylation are not known, but the P2 site (S206 in
SARS-CoV-2) is a strong consensus sequence (S/T-P-x-K/R) for Cdk1, a major cell cycle
kinase49.
To produce phosphorylated N protein, we first tested the possibility that Cdk1 primes the protein
for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK-3. We found that Cdk1-cyclin B1 phosphorylated N
protein in the SR region, and mutation of S206 reduced Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation (Fig.
3b). Phosphorylation might also occur at T198, a nearby Cdk1 consensus site. A combination of
Cdk1 and GSK-3 enhanced phosphorylation. Clear evidence for priming by Cdk1 was obtained
by extensive unlabeled phosphorylation by Cdk1, followed by analysis of radiolabeled
phosphorylation with GSK-3 (Fig. 3c).
Phosphorylation of N protein with a combination of Cdk1 and GSK-3 reduced filamentous
structures and promoted the formation of liquid-like droplets (Fig. 3d). GSK-3 alone had no
effect, whereas Cdk1 alone promoted droplets to a small extent. We conclude that

phosphorylation in the SR region shifts the behavior of N protein to promote the formation of
liquid-like condensates.
We explored the role of phosphorylation in depth with studies of a phosphomimetic mutant in
which the ten serines and threonines in the SR region were replaced with aspartate (the 10D
mutant). When combined with the 5’-400 viral RNA, the 10D protein rapidly formed condensates
with a spherical droplet morphology that was clearly distinct from the filamentous structures of
the wild-type protein (Fig. 3e). All three large viral RNAs were effective in driving droplet
formation, although N-1260 appeared to reduce the saturating concentration (Extended Data
Fig. 4a). NTE deletion in the 10D protein reduced droplet formation, showing once again the
positive role of this region (Fig. 3f). Importantly, the 10D mutation had a greater impact on
condensate morphology than an SR deletion (Fig. 2a), suggesting that phosphorylation does not
just block SR function but might also interfere with other interactions. One possibility, for
example, is that the abundant negative charge of the phosphorylated SR region interacts
intramolecularly with one or more of the positively-charged patches on the adjacent NTD or
CTD, thereby interfering with multivalent RNA-protein interactions.
Droplet formation by TRS RNA was abolished in the 10D mutant (Fig. 3e), just as we observed
with TRS RNA and the SR deletion (Fig. 2a). These results support the notion that
phosphorylation blocks the weak protein-protein interactions mediated by the SR region.
Phosphorylated N protein is thought to be localized at the RTC48. The N protein of mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV) is known to interact directly with the N-terminal Ubl1 domain of Nsp323,60, a
large transmembrane protein localized to RTC membranes23,60. We found that a GFP-tagged
Ubl1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 partitioned into N protein droplets and filamentous structures
(Extended Data Fig. 4b), providing a potential mechanism for association of the RTC with N
protein condensates.
To gain a better understanding of the properties of N protein structures, we analyzed the fusion
dynamics of different structures over time. During a short (90 s) time course, the filamentous
structures of 10 µM wild-type protein remained immobile and did not fuse, while the spherical
droplets of the 10D mutant were highly dynamic and fused rapidly (Fig. 4a). We also found that
the droplet-like structures at higher concentrations of unmodified protein displayed relatively
slow fusion activity compared to the more dynamic droplets of phosphorylated N protein (Fig.

4b). Thus, unmodified protein forms gel-like condensates that are relatively rigid, while
phosphorylated N protein forms condensates that behave more like liquid droplets.
We used negative-stain electron microscopy to further analyze mixtures of 10 µM N protein and
1 µM RNA (Fig. 4c). These images represent the saturated protein-RNA solution surrounding
condensates. Unmodified wild-type protein and viral RNA formed uniform particles of ~20 nm
diameter, reminiscent of structures seen in previous studies of partially disrupted MHV
nucleocapsids17. 2D classification of these particles revealed a uniform size and architecture
(Extended Data Fig. 4c). Thus, the gel-like filamentous condensates of the unmodified protein –
and possibly the nucleocapsid – are likely to be assembled on a foundation of discrete structural
building blocks. In contrast, the mixture of 10D mutant and RNA formed nonuniform, diffuse
chains (Fig. 4c), suggesting that phosphorylation disrupts the structural units of the unmodified
protein to help create a more liquid-like condensate.
Discussion
We conclude that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, assembles into
multiple structural forms that depend on a complex blend of intra- and intermolecular
interactions. The more rigid filamentous condensates of the unmodified protein likely depend on
high-avidity interactions mediated by multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions.
The latter might include prion-like interactions between NTEs, binding of the SR region to the
CTD44, or helical CTD polymers that depend on the CBP17,33. Long RNAs augment these
protein-protein interactions by interacting with the numerous RNA-binding sites on the protein.
Our results also support a model in which phosphorylation of the SR region blocks SR-mediated
protein-protein interactions and interferes intramolecularly with RNA binding at other sites,
resulting in a loss of affinity that generates a more dynamic liquid droplet.
The different forms of N protein oligomers seem well suited for its two major functions. In the
nucleocapsid, where extremely compact RNA packaging is the goal, the organized structures of
the unmodified protein could represent an underlying structural framework that is supplemented
by liquid-like condensation – much like chromosome packaging depends on underlying
nucleosome structure and the liquid-like behavior of chromatin proteins61,62.

The more liquid-like behavior of phosphorylated N protein droplets might be particularly
important at the RTC. There is abundant evidence linking N protein phosphorylation with
localization and function in the RTC. N protein is fully phosphorylated soon after synthesis and
rapidly associates with large membrane structures that presumably represent the RTC48. N
protein is the only viral structural protein that localizes to the RTC63, where it is seen in
immunoelectron microscopy adjacent to the double-membrane vesicles and convoluted
membranes of this organelle11. GFP-tagged N protein forms large clusters at RTCs, and
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates that N protein is dynamically associated
with these clusters25. N protein helps control subgenomic transcription in the RTC, and inhibition
of phosphorylation blocks this function5,26,27. With these lines of evidence in mind, our work
points to the possibility that a liquid-like matrix of phosphorylated N protein and loosely bound
RNA, linked to RTC membranes by Nsp3, provides a compartment to concentrate and protect
the viral replication and transcription machinery. Similar mechanisms are likely to exist in
negative-sense RNA viruses, where replication is focused in dynamic biomolecular condensates
64-66

. In Measles virus, these condensates have also been implicated in nucleocapsid

assembly67. We also note that others have recently observed SARS-CoV-2 N protein
condensates68-71.
Small chemical inhibitors of GSK-3 kinase activity disrupt MHV genome processing and reduce
the production of virions by MHV- or SARS-CoV-infected cells5,6, consistent with the importance
of N protein phosphorylation in genome replication. These inhibitors, perhaps together with
inhibitors of priming kinases such as Cdk1, have the potential to serve as antiviral therapy in the
early stages of COVID-19.

Methods
Plasmid construction and RNA preparation
All expression vectors were constructed by Gibson assembly and confirmed by sequencing.
Codon-optimized DNAs encoding SARS-CoV-2 N protein (aa 1-419) and Nsp3 Ubl1 domain (aa
819-920 of polyprotein 1a) were ordered as gBlocks from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
and cloned into pET28a expression vectors. N protein mutants were constructed by sitedirected mutagenesis and Gibson assembly. A 6xHis-SUMO tag was added to the N-terminus
of all N protein constructs. Nsp3 Ubl1 domain was engineered with a C-terminal GFP-2xStrep
tag. Codon-optimized DNAs encoding human Cdk1 (untagged) and Cyclin B1 (N-terminal
6xHis-4xMyc tag) were ordered as gBlocks from IDT and cloned individually into the baculovirus
expression vector pLIB for construction of recombinant baculoviruses72. Human GSK-3b was
purchased from Promega (V1991).
Sequences of the three viral RNAs and firefly luciferase RNA are shown in Extended Data Fig.
5. Templates for transcription in vitro of 5’-400 RNA and PS-318 RNA were ordered as gBlocks
from IDT and PCR-amplified with a 5’ primer carrying a T7 promoter sequence. The template for
N-1260 was PCR-amplified with a 5’ primer containing a T7 promoter from a PET28a vector
carrying PCR-amplified ORF DNA from the 2019-nCoV_N positive control plasmid from IDT.
The N-1260 RNA includes 152 nucleotides from the pET28a plasmid backbone. All RNA
synthesis was performed using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA synthesis kit (NEB E2040S)
according to the manufacture’s protocol. Luc-1710 RNA was included as a positive control
template in the RNA synthesis kit. The SARS-CoV-2 TRS RNA (UCUAAACGAA, tagged with
FAM fluorescent dye) was ordered from IDT.
Protein purification
N protein vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21 star (Thermo #C601003) for expression.
Freshly transformed cells were grown in TB-Kanamycin (50 µg/ml) to OD 0.4 at 37°C. The
temperature was lowered to 16°C until the cells reached a density of 0.8. Protein expression
was then induced with 0.4 mM IPTG for 16 h. Harvested cells were washed with PBS, snap
frozen in LN2, and stored at -80°C until lysis.
To remove contaminating nucleic acid, N protein was purified under denaturing conditions as
previously described47,73. Frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM

Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 6 M urea) and lysed by
sonication on ice. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C to remove cell
debris. Clarified lysate was added to Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) and incubated for 45 min
at 4°C. Ni-NTA beads were then washed with 3 x 10 bed volumes of buffer A, and N protein was
eluted with 3 bed volumes buffer B (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 250 mM
imidazole, 6 M urea). The eluate was concentrated to ~1 ml using centrifugal concentrators (30
kDa cutoff, Amicon) and renatured by overnight dialysis against 2 l buffer C (50 mM Hepes pH
7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) at 4°C. 100 µg recombinant Ulp1 catalytic domain (expressed
in and purified from bacteria) was added to renatured protein for 10 min on ice to cleave the
6xHis-SUMO tag. Mutants lacking the NTE were not cleaved as efficiently by Ulp1, and
complete cleavage required incubation with Ulp1 at 25°C for 4 h. Cleaved protein was then
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and injected onto a Superdex 200 10/300 size exclusion
column equilibrated in buffer C. Peak fractions were pooled, frozen in LN2, and stored at -80°C.
In early experiments, N protein was purified under native conditions. Frozen cell pellets were
thawed and resuspended in buffer D (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20
mM imidazole) supplemented with benzonase, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice
and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Clarified lysate was added to Ni-NTA agarose
beads and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. Ni-NTA beads were then washed with 3 x 10 bed
volumes buffer D, and N protein was eluted with 3 bed volumes buffer D + 500 mM imidazole.
The eluate was concentrated to ~1 ml using centrifugal concentrators (30 kDa cutoff, Amicon)
and injected onto a Superdex 200 10/300 size exclusion column. Peak fractions were pooled,
snap frozen in LN2, and stored at -80°C. Protein concentration was measured by nanodrop, and
a major A260 peak was observed. The A260 peak was insensitive to treatment with DNase I,
RNase A, RNase H, or benzonase. Additionally, small RNA species were observed on native
TBE gels stained with Sybr gold.
Nsp3 Ubl1-GFP was expressed in E. coli as described above. Frozen cell pellets were thawed
and resuspended in buffer E (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT)
supplemented with benzonase, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and 1
mM PMSF. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at
4°C. Clarified lysate was then added to a 5 ml StrepTrap HP prepacked column (GE). The
column was washed with 10 column volumes buffer E and eluted with 4 column volumes buffer

E supplemented with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. Peak fractions were pooled, snap frozen in LN2, and
stored at -80°C.
Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes were prepared as follows. Two 666 ml cultures of SF-900 cells
(1.6×106 cells/ml) were infected separately with Cdk1 or cyclin B1 baculovirus and harvested
after 48 h. The two cell pellets were frozen in LN2. Frozen pellets were thawed and each
resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mM

sonication. To generate an active Cdk1-cyclin B1 complex phosphorylated by Cdk-activating
kinase in the lysate74, the two lysates were combined, brought to 5 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2,
and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The combined lysates were centrifuged at
55,000 rpm for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered and passed over a HisTRAP nickel
affinity column, washed with wash buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol)
and eluted with the same buffer plus 200 mM imidazole. Peak fractions were pooled,
concentrated to 0.75 ml, and injected on an S200 size exclusion column in wash buffer. Peak
fractions containing the Cdk1-cyclin B1 complex were pooled, concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml, and
snap frozen in LN2.
Light microscopy
Glass was prepared as described previously75. Individual wells in a 384-well glass bottom plate
(Greiner #781892) were incubated with 2% Hellmanex detergent for 1 h. Wells were then
washed 3 times with 100 µl ddH2O. 1 M NaOH was added to the glass for 30 min, followed by
washing 3 times with 100 µl ddH2O. The glass was dried, and 20 mg/ml PEG silane dissolved in
95% EtOH was added to individual wells and incubated overnight (~16 h). The glass was then
washed 3 times with 100 µl ddH2O and dried before sample addition.
The day prior to imaging, protein was thawed and dialyzed against droplet buffer (25 mM Hepes
pH 7.5, 70 mM KCl) overnight at 4°C. Protein concentration was then quantified by nanodrop.
Reactions containing protein and RNA were combined and mixed immediately before adding to
individual wells in the PEG-treated 384-well plate. All reactions were incubated for 30 min at
room temperature, unless otherwise indicated, before imaging on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M
microscope with a 40x oil objective.

Protein was dialyzed into droplet buffer the night before performing turbidity measurements, as
stated above. Protein was then serially diluted into room temperature droplet buffer. After
dilution, RNA was added and mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before
measuring the absorbance at 340 nm on a Spectramax M5 plate reader.
Kinase reactions
1 µM N protein was incubated with either 0.14 µM GSK3-b, 0.91 µM Cdk1-Cyclin B1, or both, in
a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 500 µM ATP, 25 mM Hepes pH
7.8, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.001 mCi/ml 32P-g-ATP. After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, reactions
were quenched with 10 µl SDS loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and visualization with
a Phosphorimager. For the priming experiment in Fig. 3c, 19 µM of each N protein variant was
incubated with 2.5 µM Cdk1-Cyclin B1 overnight at 25°C in kinase buffer A (20 mM Hepes pH
7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP). Reactions were desalted into kinase
buffer B (20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 500 µM ATP). 10 µM of desalted N
protein was incubated with 0.17 µM GSK3-β and 0.05 µCi 32P-g-ATP. After various times,
reactions were quenched with SDS loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and visualization
with a Phosphorimager.
Phosphorylated protein for droplet analysis was prepared in reactions containing 25 µM N
protein, 1 µM Cdk1-cyclin B1, 0.2 µM GSK-3b, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM MgCl2, 15 mM Hepes pH 7.5,
300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 8 mM phosphocreatine (Sigma 10621714001), and
0.016 mg/ml creatine kinase (Sigma C3755). The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 30°C and
then dialyzed overnight into droplet buffer at 4°C. RNA addition and droplet visualization were
carried out as described above.
Electron microscopy
N protein (10 µM) and RNA (1 µM PS-318) were mixed in 10 µl droplet buffer and incubated 15
min at room temperature. 3.5 μl of this solution was adsorbed onto glow-discharged (PELCO
EasiGlow, 15 mA, 0.39 mBar, 30 s) carbon-coated grids (200-400 mesh copper, Quantifoil) for 1
min at room temperature. Sample was blotted off, stained and blotted 5 times with 0.75% uranyl
formate, and allowed to air dry. Negative stain images were collected with a Tecnai T12
microscope (FEI) with a LaB6 filament, operated at 120 kV, and a Gatan Ultrascan CCD camera
