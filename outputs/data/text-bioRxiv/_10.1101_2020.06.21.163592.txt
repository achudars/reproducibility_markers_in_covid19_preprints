RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE FROM SARS-COV-2.
MECHANISM OF REACTION AND INHIBITION BY
REMDESIVIR

Juan Aranda 1 & Modesto Orozco1,2*

We combine sequence analysis, molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to obtain the first description of the mechanism
of reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and of the inhibition of the
enzyme by Remdesivir. Despite its evolutionary youth, the enzyme is highly optimized to have
good fidelity in nucleotide incorporation and a good catalytic efficiency. Our simulations
strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into
the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an
unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir
at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the
exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify
delayed inhibition. However, after the incorporation of three more nucleotides we found a
hydrated Serine which is placed in a perfect arrangement to react through a Pinner’s reaction
with the nitrile group of Remdesivir. Kinetic barriers for crosslinking and polymerization are
similar suggesting a competition between polymerization and inhibition. Analysis of SARS-CoV2 mutational landscape and structural analysis of polymerases across different species support
the proposed mechanism and suggest that virus has not explored yet resistance to Remdesivir
inhibition.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 (Covid19) emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread over the world,
causing a world-wide health threat. At the beginning of June 2020 Covid19 pandemic has
caused around 400,000 fatalities and at least 6 million people have been infected, producing
an unprecedent stress to the health-care systems.1 From a phylogenetic point of view SARSCoV-2 belongs to the b- genus of the coronavirus family which includes other highly infective
pathogens such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) or the severe acute
respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).2 SARS-CoV-2 has a large (30 kb of positive RNA)
genome, which forces it to a high fidelity in replication and accordingly to a relatively low
mutational rate.3,4 A high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a proof-reading
exonuclease5 are the crucial elements for maintaining the stability of the viral genome.
RdRp is the core of the replication machinery of the virus, and the largest protein in the viral
genome (932 residues). It binds to nsp7 and nsp8 to form an active complex,6 that using as
template the sense RNA generates a negative copy, which in a second cycle is used to generate
new copies of genomic and sub-genomic RNAs. At least two other proteins are involved in the
replication process: a 601-residue helicase and a 527-residue proof-reading exonuclease.7 A
simple BLAST8 query shows that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is highly conserved within the Coronavirus
family, but no homologs are found out of it. This would suggest that we are in front of a quite
new protein, which, in principle, did not have enough evolutionary time to optimize its
function. Unfortunately, the extremely high infectivity of the virus suggests that despite its
youth, RdRp is very effective. How the enzyme achieves a good specificity and an excellent
catalytic power is still unclear, generating an important gap in our knowledge on SARS-CoV-2
replicative cycle.
Due to its central role in the viral infective cycle, RNA polymerases are a major target for
fighting RNA-viruses.6,9 As today, the only FDA-approved drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2
infection10 is a RdRp inhibitor Remdesivir (R), a C-nucleoside (see Supplementary Fig. 1) which
was in clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola,11 a negative single strand RNA virus very distant
from SARS-CoV-2, but whose replication is also dependent on the action of a RdRp. The
mechanism of inhibition of RdRp by Remdesivir is mostly unknown and conflicting hypothesis
have emerged the last months. This lack of knowledge dramatically hampers our ability to
develop new and more active derivatives.
We present here a comprehensive theoretical study on the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV2 RdRp. MD simulations show that despite its youth the enzyme has a discriminant active site
which should guarantee high replication fidelity. MD and QM/MM simulations demonstrate
that the enzyme follows a canonical 2-ions reaction mechanism with a catalytic efficiency
similar to that of the highly evolved eukaryotic polymerases. The same type of calculations
demonstrates that Remdesivir triphosphate (RTP; the expected bioactive form of Remdesivir)
can be recognized and incorporated into a nascent RNA with an efficiency only slightly lower
than natural nucleotides, i.e. R is not an inhibitor of nucleotide incorporation. Extended MD
simulations failed to detect any dramatically distortion in the RNA duplex due to the presence
of Remdesivir which would justify inhibitory properties. Furthermore, no steric clashes were
detected when the nascent RNA duplex was displaced along the exit channel (see below),

which argue against the hypothesis that steric clashes could explain a delayed inhibition.
However, the same analysis suggests that when three more nucleotides are incorporated to
the RNA after Remdesivir, the C1’ nitrile group of Remdesivir reaches the proximity to Ser861
favoring an unexpected crosslinking reaction. Activation barriers of polymerization and
crosslinking are comparable, raising an interesting scenario of competition between
polymerization and inhibition which can explain the unique inhibitory properties of
Remdesivir. In summary, our results provide then, not only the first atomistic description of
the mechanism of action or SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase, but also a plausible explanation for
the inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir.

METHODS
RdRp complex set-up. The cryo-EM structure of the RdRp (nsp12) of SARS-CoV-2 complexed to
nsp8 and nsp712 cofactors was used as our starting model. We aligned it with the RdRp from
Hepatitis-C virus X-ray structure13 from which RNA, the two catalytic metal ions and the
diphosphate group of an NTP analogue were extracted (see Supplementary Methods for
details). During the preparation of this manuscript a cryo-EM structure of RdRp in complex
with a full RNA strand appeared14, confirming the accuracy of our model (see Supplementary
Fig. 2). Afterwards, we built a UTP or RTP molecule inside the active site in the expected
orientation required for incorporation into the nascent RNA strand. The system was solvated
and neutralized prior to optimization, thermalization (T=298K) and equilibration (see
Supplementary Methods for details). The final equilibrated structure was the starting point for
further MD simulations. The progression of the polymerization process was simulated by
adding additional base pair steps to the RNA duplex, moving the r(R·U) pair from i+1 to i+4
position keeping constant the reactive alignments at the i-position (see Supplementary Fig. 3).
These structures allowed us to trace the sliding of the nascent RNA duplex along the exit path
and check for potential reasons for the R-induced delayed termination of the polymerization
reaction.
MD simulations on RdRp. Classical trajectories were used to refine and check the stability of
complexes prior to running QM/MM simulations, as well as to determine the impact of Rincorporation in RNA. Minimization, thermalization and equilibration were performed using
standard procedures as described in Supplementary Methods. Production simulations were
carried out using the AMBER 18 program15 and state-of-the art conditions for a total time of at
least 0.5 µs. Water molecules were described through the TIP3P16 model, parameters of
Magnesium ions were taken from Allner et al.,17 Carlson et al.18 parameters were used for
triphosphate groups, PARMBSC0-chiOL3 for RNA.19–22 and ff14SB23 for the proteins. Parameters
and charges of UTP, RTP, Remdesivir nucleotide and 3’ terminal U and R were derived to be
compatible with the force fields making use of the RED server.24 Additional details of the
simulation setups can be found in Supplementary Methods.
QM/MM systems. Two families of systems were generated to explore enzyme reactivity. The
first was created to follow nucleotide incorporation, while the second was intended to study a
potential crosslinking between Ser861 and the nitrile group of RNA-incorporated Remdesivir.

QM subsystems used in reactivity calculations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The QM part
was described at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory, using the link-atom to join QM and MM
regions.15 The hybrid QM/MM models were built using randomly selected snapshots obtained
in the last ns of unrestrained MD simulations, which were then minimized and re-equilibrated
at the B3LYP/6-31G**/MM level of theory. A spherical droplet was extracted to compute twodimensional B3LYP/6-31G**/MM potential energy surfaces (PES) in both forward and reverse
directions. Selected reaction coordinates for the phosphoryl transfer are shown in Fig. 2 B and
those for the crosslink of Ser861 with Remdesivir are shown Fig. 3 B, (see also Supplementary
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods). The AMBER program interfaced with Terachem 1.925,26
was used for the QM/MM calculations. Electrostatic embedding was used in all hybrid
calculations.
QM/MM Exploration of the Minimum Free Energy Paths and Potential of Mean Force.
QM/MM-MD simulations were performed to obtain minimum free energy paths (MFEPs) by
means of the string method.27,28 This method allowed us to explore different reaction
mechanisms and select the preferred one in terms of free energy. From 60 to 120 string nodes
were used. Afterwards, a path collective variable (CV)28 was defined to obtain the potential of
mean force (PMF) using from 60 to 120 umbrella sampling29 windows. The chosen set of CVs
that followed the progress of the reactions, the breaking and forming bonds, are shown in Fig.
2 B, Fig. 3 B and Supplementary Methods (see Supplementary Fig. 4). MFEPs were obtained at
the DFTB330,31/MM level and the PMFs were corrected at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level. The
error of the free energy barriers was calculated as 95% confidence intervals and reached
values within ± 1 kcal·mol-1. Each of the sampling windows consisted on 20ps of equilibration
followed by 200ps of production. The AMBER program15 with electrostatic embedding was
used for the QM/MM calculations. Corrections at the high level of theory were made with
Gaussian1632 (see Supplementary Methods).
MD simulations on nascent RNA. We performed MD simulations on two duplexes:
r(CGCGAAUUGCGC)·r(GCGCAAUUCGCG) and r(CGCGARUUGCGC)·r(GCGCAAUUCGCG) to
determine the structural impact of the introduction of a Remdesivir in a canonical RNA duplex.
Starting structures were those expected for a canonical RNA duplex as implemented in
AMBER. Systems were hydrated, minimized, thermalized and equilibrated using standard
protocols33,34 before 1 µs long MD trajectories at constant temperature (T=298K) and pressure
(P=1 atm). Details of simulations are shown in Supplementary Methods.
Sequence analysis. Mutations affecting RdRp were reconstructed using the augur pipeline to
infer nucleotide changes at the internal nodes35 applied to 12397 GISAID samples obtained on
30/05/2020. The consequence type of the RdRp mutations was annotated using a customized
implementation of the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP version 92) using the first SARSCoV-2 sequenced genome (NCBI ID: NC_045512v2) as a reference. Afterwards, mutations were
mapped on the MD-refined structure of the RdRp-RNA complex to locate their proximity to
crucial functional regions. The aggressiveness of each individual mutation was evaluated from
BLOSUM80 matrices.36 Homolog search were performed with BLASTP8 as implemented in the
ncbi web server (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Alignments were performed using EMBOSS
program37 as implemented in the EBI webserver (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site suggests good fidelity and activity. The viral protein (see Fig. 1 A)
has a quite canonical active site similar to those of other polymerases. Two essential Mg2+
coordinate the b and g phosphate groups of the incoming triphosphate nucleotide as well as
Asp618, Asp760, Tyr609, and the O3’ terminal of the negative RNA strand (see Fig. 1 B), which
according to the circular reaction mechanism for polymerases by de Vivo and coworkers is
expected to be ionized.38 Two Arginine residues (Arg624 and Arg553) coordinate the phosphates
of the incoming nucleotide aligning the gamma phosphate for an effective transfer (see Fig. 1
C). The affinity for ribonucleotides triphosphate substrates can be explained by the need for
North puckering (otherwise reactive groups are not well aligned), as well as by a myriad of
specific H-bonds between the 2’OH group of the NTP and the catalytic site Asp623 and Ser683
side chains (see Fig. 1 C). Additional hydrogen bonds are found between i+1 2’OH and Ser759
(see Fig. 1 D). The base-specificity is controlled by the complementarity of hydrogen bonding
with the template nucleobase (see Fig. 1 E, Supplementary Fig. 5), by the phosphate
coordination, as well as by the residues surrounding the active site that embrace the pairs
introducing strong isosteric requirements that make very unlikely a non-Watson-Crick pairing
scheme (see Fig. 1 E). Overall the active site emerging from EM structures12,14,39,40 and
atomistic simulation strongly suggest that despite the reduced evolutionary refinement, SARSCoV-2 RdRp has all the structural requirements to be an efficient RNA polymerase, both in
terms of catalysis and substrate specificity.

The RNA-pol reaction mechanism. QM/MM simulations were used (see Methods and
Supplementary Methods) to study the ability of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to incorporate a natural triphosphate (NTP, exemplified here by UTP), as well as RTP (Remdesivir-TP) into a nascent RNA.
Careful analysis of trajectories and of the free energy profiles shows that the calculation is well
converged leading to a smooth free energy profile with a single maximum (Transition State,
TS), a free energy of activation of 15.8 kcal·mol-1 for UTP (see Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Video 1) and a negative free energy of reaction (around 5 kcal/mol prior to PPi
release). Very interestingly, kinetic parameters for RdRp compare well to those associated to
prokaryotic or eukaryotic polymerases,41–43 which combined with the similarity in the reaction
mechanism allow us to conclude that the enzyme can be quite novel in evolutionary terms, but
it is as efficient as the highly evolved eukaryotic polymerases.
Trajectories show that RTP fits very well into the active site showing strong canonical Watson
Crick interactions with the uridine in the template RNA. Its isosterism with adenosine allows a
perfect shape complementarity at the binding site showing an arrangement of reactive groups
that predicts that it will be a substrate rather than an inhibitor. This hypothesis is confirmed by
accurate QM/MM simulation that show that incorporation of RTP can happen with a free
energy barrier only slightly larger than that of a natural substrate (10% up to 17.4 kcal·mol-1;
see Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Video 2). Such an increase is due mostly to
a slight misalignment of the Oa-Pa-O3’ attack angle (161 ± 8º for RTP and 172 ± 5º for UTP;
see also Supplementary Fig. 6-8). Thus, in agreement with recent EM experiments14 we can
rule out the possibility of Remdesivir inhibiting RdRp by blocking the ATP-binding site of RNA
polymerase. On the contrary, our simulation strongly suggests that RTP can be efficiently
incorporated in front of uridine in a nascent RNA strand.

Remdesivir is well tolerated in an RNA duplex. Remdesivir is a C-nucleoside that may produce
distortions in the helix which might result in a delayed inhibition of the enzyme due to
incorrect displacement of the nascent duplex along the exit channel. To explore this possibility,
we performed MD simulations of two RNA duplexes differing only in the substitution of a
central r(A·U) pair by r(R·U) one (see Methods). Results summarized in Fig. 3 strongly suggest
that Remdesivir is well tolerated in an RNA duplex and does not introduce any major structural
distortion which could justify termination of RNA synthesis. Particularly, there are not
significant differences between the hydrogen bonding stability of r(A·U) and r(R·U) pairs (see

8

Fig. 3 C). With the required cautions derived from the well-known uncertainties of RNA forcefield and of the limited sampling (1 µs), our results argue against the idea that a dramatic
structural alteration of the RNA duplex is the key responsible for Remdesivir-induced
termination of the RNA synthesis.

Remdesivir can crosslink RNA and RdRp. Trying to explore alternative reasons for the
inhibitory properties of Remdesivir we slide the nascent RNA duplex along the exit tunnel of
RdRp to make the r(R·U) pair by simulating addition of extra nucleotides. This allows us to scan
interactions of the RNA at several positions along the exit tunnel. After R was incorporated we
were not able to detect any point of steric clash that could justify stopping the polymerase
progression (see Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, when three more nucleotides were
incorporated, we found a Ser861 whose side chain locates at around 3.7±0.3 Å from the nitrile
group of Remdesivir (see Supplementary Fig. 10 A B). The distance does not justify however a
steric clash considering the large flexibility of the Ser sidechain, especially in a well-solvated
microenvironment (see Supplementary Fig. 10 A), arguing against the hypothesis that nitrileSer861 steric clash can explain the inhibitory properties of Remdesivir.10 However, a close look
to the trajectories shows that the Ser861 side chain is frequently pointing towards the nitrile
group of Remdesivir in an arrangement suitable for a nucleophilic attack and in the presence
of water that spontaneously enters into the cavity (see Supplementary Fig. 10 C D). In
summary, it is placed in an optimal position as to act as a general acid/base catalyst. Note that,
while not suggested for this protein, attacks of serine and cysteine to nitrile groups have been
characterized for other proteins,44,45 which drives us to explore in more detail this potential
reaction mechanism by using a QM/MM strategy similar to that used to describe the
polymerization reaction (see Methods). Results (see Fig. 4, QM/MM PES in Supplementary Fig.
11, and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4) show a concerted reaction mechanism where, while
hydroxylic group of Ser861 attacks the carbon atom of the nitrile group, a water molecule (see
Supplementary Fig. 10 D) abstracts one proton from the hydroxyl group of Ser861, donating it to
the N atom of nitrile group (see Fig. 4 D, Supplementary Video 3). The structures sampled
along the minimum free energy profile agree with the electronic flow for a Pinner reaction.46
Our calculations suggest an exergonic (-10.7 kcal·mol-1; see Fig. 4 A) process showing a single
TS (as expected from a concerted mechanism; see Figure 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11) with an
activation barrier of 14.7 kcal·mol-1; see Fig. 3 A), which compare with the activation barrier of
polymerization of a UTP (15.8 kcal·mol-1) and RTP (17.4 kcal·mol-1).
QM/MM calculations suggest the existence of a kinetic competition between UTP
incorporation and crosslinking leading to enzyme inhibition. In principle, barrier for UTP
incorporation is slightly larger than that of crosslinking, which suggests that the RNA will be
kinetically trapped stopping the extension of the RNA, and inhibiting then the activity of the
enzyme. However, we can expect residual polymerization leading to longer transcripts, as
experimentally observed.9 A larger concentration of Remdesivir might favor the inhibition by a
double mechanism: by increasing the probability of RTP incorporation into nascent RNA and
also by enlarging the gap in relative activation free energy between polymerization and

10

crosslinking (from 1.1 kcal·mol-1 to 2.7 kcal·mol-1), and driving then the kinetic balance towards
the inhibition side.
The proposed covalent inhibition mechanism is consistent with the incorporation of three
more nucleotides after incorporation of Remdesivir to RNA9 and agrees with a myriad of
indirect evidences other than the delay inhibitory properties of Remdesivir. For example,
mutational analysis shows that Ser861 has a crucial role in R-induced inhibition of RdRp.40
Furthermore, large and systematic efforts to substitute the nitrile group by less problematic
substituents (the nitrile group appears as a “probably undesired” consequence of the
Remdesivir synthetic pathway) resulted in molecules with a lower inhibitory profile.47 Finally,
Pinner reaction has not been described for RdRp, but has been experimentally validated for
many several nitrile-containing drugs designed to inhibit cysteine or serine proteases.48,49
Altogether, results strongly suggest that Remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by a covalent
mechanism.

Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-pol agrees with the proposed reaction mechanisms.
Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 viruses have been sequenced, showing that RdRp accumulates a
non-negligible number of mutations, which lead to viable virus, i.e., to active RdRp. We should
then check whether some of these mutations invalidate our reaction mechanism. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 12, this is not the case, missense variant leading to amino-acid changes are
typically mild according to BLOSUM80 matrices and are located in loops on the surface of the
protein (Supplementary Fig. 12 A). Particularly, the active site and the exit tunnel are very well
conserved during the viral evolution (see Supplementary Fig. 12 B, C). Moreover, virus has not
explored yet mutational landscape in the region of the Ser861 (see Supplementary Fig. 12 D).
Remdesivir is not likely to affect human RNA polymerases. Remdesivir enters in human cells
and is transformed into RTP also by human enzymes. Considering the similarity in the
mechanism of reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and human polymerases we could expect
Remdesivir being incorporated into RNA, which could rise to inhibition of the human enzyme
with toxic consequences. To check this possibility we explored the extension of the nascent
RNA along the exit channel to trace close interactions between the nitrile group and serine or
cysteine residues in the two crystallized human RNA polymerases (RNA polymerase50 and
human RNA polymerase II51). We did not find any of these residues in the expected
displacement path of Remdesivir once incorporated into the nascent RNA (see Supplementary
Fig. 13). In other words, no significant inhibition of the human polymerases is expected. Note
that this explains the reduced toxicity of Remdesivir in humans.52,53
Inhibition mechanism can be common to other viruses. Ser861 is highly conserved in other
CoVs RdRps (see Supplementary Fig. 14), placing a constant position in an alpha helix that
adopts a highly conserved 3D arrangement (compare SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
structures)12,14,39,40,54 and this position is well preserved in those cases for which CoV RdRps
structure is available. This would suggest that Remdesivir might be effective against many
other CoV RdRps. The mechanism of inhibition of other distant RNA-viruses (Marburg virus,
Ebola, Hepatitis C and many others) might be similar, but needs to be elucidated. It is tempting
to believe that enzymes evolved to discriminate between DNA (2’deoxyribose) and RNA
(ribose) might be decorated with a large number of serine, tyrosine or threonine in the exit
channel, suggesting a general delay inhibitory mechanism like that suggested here. Note that
this would agree with the delayed inhibition of Ebola RdRp by Remdesivir.55 The lack of
structural information and the poor sequence similarity between the RdRps precludes to
confirm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is a protein common to other coronaviruses, but showing little homology
out of the family. As CoVs are just a few thousand years old, the protein has had a limited
evolutionary period and we could expect low efficiency. However, our calculations show that it
has a well refined reaction site able to select the entering nucleotide and to catalyze its
addition to a nascent RNA. The viral enzyme follows a mechanism that is similar to that of
bacterial or eukaryotic polymerases with the transferred phosphate being stabilized by 2 Mg2+

12

ions exquisitely coordinated by acidic residues of the catalytic site, while the phosphates of the
incoming nucleotide being stabilized by a network of basic residues.
Our simulations very clearly suggest that RTP is not inhibiting the active site by competing with
ATP at the catalytic site, but that it is incorporated into the nascent RNA in front of a uridine.
The resulting duplex does not show dramatic structural changes which would hinder
displacement of the nascent duplex along the exit channel. In fact, analysis of the
displacement of the RNA-containing Remdesivir along the exit tunnel fail to detect points of
steric clashes, but show the spontaneous formation of a catalytical arrangement that justifies a
Pinner reaction (between the nitrile group of Remdesivir and Ser681), leading to the formation
of a protein-RNA covalent bond. However, we cannot determine whether this inhibition will be
reversible or not, as inspection of the free energy curve (Fig. 4D) and the behavior of similar
inhibitors49 for other proteins suggest that it may display slow reversibility.49,56 This potential
reversibility combined with the kinetic competition between crosslinking and polymerization
might explain the unusual inhibitory properties of Remdesivir. Results presented here open
then the possibility to design better inhibitors of CoVs RdRps and to a rethinking on the use of
covalent inhibitors of pathological proteins.
