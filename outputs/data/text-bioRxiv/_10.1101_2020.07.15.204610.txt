Summary

17
18

The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be at least partially driven by the selective

19

pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of

20

high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell

21

epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than

22

non-epitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the

23

SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope

24

positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most

25

immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time-frames

26

indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is

27

evolving to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells might benefit the

28

virus.

Introduction

40
41

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae Study

42

Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy,of Viruses, 2020). Most likely, SARS-CoV-2

43

originated and evolved in bats, eventually spilling over to humans, either directly or through an

44

intermediate host (Killerby et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sironi et al., 2020; Wong et

45

al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). Sustained human-to-human transmission determined

46

the global spread of the virus, which has now resulted in an unprecedented global sanitary crisis. In

47

fact, whereas the majority of COVID-19 cases are relatively mild, a significant proportion of patients

48

develop a serious, often fatal illness, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (Wu and

49

McGoogan, 2020). Both viral-induced lung pathology and overactive immune responses are thought to

50

contribute to disease severity (St John and Rathore, 2020; Vabret et al., 2020).

51

Ample evidence suggests that coronaviruses can easily cross species barriers and have high zoonotic

52

potential. Indeed, seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans and all of them originated in

53

animals (Cui et al., 2019; Forni et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2020). Among these, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-

54

HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E have been circulating for decades in human populations and

55

usually cause limited disease (Bucknall et al., 1972; Forni et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2005). They are thus

56

referred to as “common cold” coronaviruses. Conversely, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, whose

57

emergence in the 2000s preceded that of SARS-CoV-2, can cause serious illness and respiratory

58

distress syndrome in a non-negligible proportion of infected individuals (Petrosillo et al., 2020). Like

59

all coronaviruses, these human-infecting viruses have positive-sense, single stranded RNA genomes.

60

Two thirds of the coronavirus genome are occupied by two large overlapping open reading frames

61

(ORF1a and ORF1b), that are translated into polyproteins. These latter are processed to generate 16

62

non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). The remaining portion of the genome includes ORFs for the

63

structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and a variable number of accessory

64

proteins (Cui et al., 2019; Forni et al., 2017).

65

Analysis of the bat viruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 indicated that, in analogy to SARS-

66

CoV, the virus most likely required limited adaptation to gain the ability to infect and spread in our

67

species (Boni et al., 2020; Cagliani et al., 2020). Nonetheless, since its introduction in human

68

populations SARS-CoV-2 must have been subject to the selective pressure imposed by the human

69

immune system. In fact, as with most other viruses, data from COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients

70

indicate that both B and T lymphocytes play a role in controlling infection (Channappanavar et al.,

71

2014; St John and Rathore, 2020; Vabret et al., 2020).

72

Recent efforts predicted B cell and T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Grifoni et al., 2020a) and

73

validated such predictions using sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients (Grifoni et al., 2020b).

74

These works, as well as others (Farrera et al., 2020; Poh et al., 2020), revealed that the cell-mediated

75

responses against SARS-CoV-2 are not restricted to the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins, but

76

rather target both structural and non-structural viral products. In parallel, analyses of B cell responses

77

in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed that the S and N proteins are the major target of the antibody

78

response and identified specific B cell epitopes in the S protein (Farrera et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020;

79

Poh et al., 2020). We exploited this growing wealth of information to investigate whether, after a few

80

months of sustained transmission, the selective pressure exerted by the human adaptive immune

81

response is already detectable in the SARS-CoV-2 population and to investigate how the virus is

82

evolving in response to such a pressure.

87
88

To analyze B cell epitope diversity in SARS-CoV-2, we randomly selected 10,000 high-quality viral

89

genomes from those available in the GISAID database (as of June 5th, 2020) (Elbe and Buckland-

90

Merrett, 2017). Potential epitopes were predicted using Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) tools, as

91

previously described (Grifoni et al., 2020a). Specifically, because they are the major targets of the

92

humoral immune response (Channappanavar et al., 2014; St John and Rathore, 2020; Vabret et al.,

93

2020), we predicted both linear and conformational B epitopes for the S and N proteins, whereas only

94

linear epitopes were predicted for the other viral proteins (Table S1). A good correspondence was

95

observed between B cell epitope predictions for the S protein and epitopes identified in two works that

96

systematically mapped antibody responses in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients (Farrera et

97

al., 2020; Poh et al., 2020) (Figure 1).

98

Variability at each amino acid site of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 was quantified using

99

Shannon's entropy (H). Specifically, only predicted proteins longer than 60 amino acids were analyzed.

100

Because most positions in SARS-CoV-2 genomes are invariable across the sampled genomes, the

101

distribution of H is zero-inflated, making the use of conventional statistical tests inappropriate

102

(McElduff et al., 2010). We thus calculated statistical significance by permutations - i.e., by reshuffling

103

epitope positions as amino acid stretches of the same size as the predicted epitopes. This approach also

104

has the advantage of accounting for the possibility that, as a result of locally varying selective

105

constraints, H is not independent among continuous protein positions.

106

Using this methodology, we found that, for the N and nsp16 proteins, positions mapping to predicted B

107

cell linear epitopes are significantly more variable than those not mapping to these epitopes. Higher

108

diversity of B cell epitopes was also observed for S, although it did not reach statistical significance

109

(Figure 2). However, the H distribution for the spike protein includes a clear outlier represented by

110

position 614 (Figure 1). Recent works indicated that the D614G variant, which is now prevalent

111

worldwide, enhances viral infectivity without affecting neutralization by convalescent patient plasma

112

(Korber et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b). Hence, the frequency increase of

113

this variant is unlikely to be related to immune evasion. We thus repeated the analyses after excluding

114

position 614 and we observed that predicted B cell linear epitopes in the spike protein are significantly

115

more variable than non-epitope positions (Figure 2). The same analysis for B cell conformational

116

epitopes in the N and S proteins indicated a similar trend, although statistical significance was not

117

reached (not shown). This is most likely due to the small number of positions in these epitopes.

118

Overall, these data fit very well with the observation that most humoral immune responses against

119

SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses are directed against the S and N proteins (Farrera et al.,

120

2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Poh et al., 2020). These results also support the notion that the selective

121

pressure exerted by the human antibody response is already detectable in the SARS-CoV-2 population.

122

We next assessed whether epitopes for cell-mediated immune responses are also more variable than

123

non-epitope positions. We thus retrieved predicted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes from a previous

124

work (Grifoni et al., 2020a). These epitope predictions were shown to be reliable, as they capture a

125

significant proportion of T cell responses in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients (Grifoni et al.,

126

2020b). Analysis of entropy values indicated that CD4+ T cell epitopes are significantly less variable

127

than non-epitope positions for the N and nsp16 proteins (Figure 2). A similar trend was observed for

128

ORF8, E, and S, although significance was not reached. Reduction of variability was also observed for

129

CD8+ T cell epitopes for the N protein, as well as for ORF3a. Higher variability in epitope positions

130

was observed for nsp8 and nsp14 for CD4+ T cells alone (Figure 2). Because several epitopes for T

131

cells co-map with B cell epitopes, which tend to show higher diversity, we compared positions within

132

CD4+ or CD8+ T cell epitopes only (not overlapping with B cell epitopes) with positions not mapping

133

to any of these epitopes. A significant reduction of variability was observed for S, N, ORF8, nsp15, and

134

nsp16, whereas higher diversity was still evident for nsp8 (Figure 2).

135

Overall, these data indicate that T cell epitopes in the most immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, N,

136

ORF3a, and ORF8) (Grifoni et al., 2020b; Peng et al., 2020b) tend to be more conserved than non-

137

epitopes. However, this was not the case for other proteins targeted by T cell responses, namely M,

138

ORF7a, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6.

139

Clearly, protein sequence variability is strongly influenced by functional and structural constraints. We

140

thus reasoned that if the observations reported above were secondary to the incidental co-localization of

141

T cell epitopes with more constrained regions, a similar pattern should be observed for H values

142

calculated on an alignment of proteins from other sarbecoviruses. In fact, all these viruses, with the

143

exclusion of SARS-CoV, were sampled from bats. Thus, whereas structural/functional constraints are

144

expected to be maintained across long evolutionary time frames, the pressure exerted by the human

145

cell-mediated immune response is not, as, in different species, antigen processing within host cells

146

results in the preferential presentation of diverse viral epitopes to T lymphocytes depending on the

147

MHC gene repertoire and on distinct preferences of the antigen processing pathway (Abduriyim et al.,

148

2019; Burgevin et al., 2008; Hammer et al., 2007; Lu, Dan AND Liu, Kefang AND Zhang, Di AND

149

Yue, Can AND Lu, Qiong AND Cheng, Hao AND Wang, Liang AND Chai, Yan AND Qi, Jianxun

150

AND Wang, Lin-Fa AND Gao, George F. AND Liu,William J., 2019; Wynne et al., 2016). Conversely,

151

epitopes for antibodies tend to be conserved across species (Tse et al., 2017; Wiehe et al., 2014) and

152

consequently the selective pressure acting on these positions is expected to be constant across time and

153

hosts.

154

We thus aligned the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences of proteins showing decreased or increased

155

variability in T cell epitopes with those of 45 sarbecoviruses (Table S2). Calculation of H indicated a

156

significant difference only for CD4+ T cell epitopes in the N protein. Conversely, B cell epitopes were

157

more variable than non-epitope positions for the S, N and nsp16 proteins (Figure 3). Overall, these

158

results indicate that the variability within SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes is not primarily driven by

159

functional/structural constraints, but most likely results from the interaction with the human adaptive

160

immune response.

161
162

Comparison with other human coronaviruses

163
164

Given the results above we set out to determine whether the other human coronaviruses show the same

165

tendency of reduced and increased variability at T cell and B cell epitopes, respectively. For these

166

viruses, analyses were restricted to the N and S proteins, as they are the most antigenic proteins and

167

because the number of complete viral genomes is relatively limited (Table S3).

168

SARS-CoV, the human coronavirus most similar to SARS-CoV-2, caused the first human outbreak in

169

2002/2003 after a spill-over from palm civets, followed by human-to-human transmission chains (Shi

170

and Wang, 2017). A second zoonotic transmission occurred in December 2003 and caused a limited

171

number of cases (Shi and Wang, 2017; Wang et al., 2005). Viral genomes sampled during the second

172

outbreak were not included in the analyses because their evolution occurred in the civet reservoir

173

(Table S4). Four other human coronaviruses – HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 (members of the

174

Embecovirus subgenus), HCoV-229E (Duvinavirus subgenus), and HCoV-NL63 (Setracovirus

175

subgenus) - have been transmitting within human populations for at least 70 years (Forni et al., 2017).

176

Thus, all available S and N sequences were included in the analyses (Table S4). Conversely, MERS-

177

CoV displays limited ability of human-to-human transmission and outbreaks were caused by repeated

178

spill-over events from the camel host (Cui et al., 2019). For this reason MERS-CoV was excluded from

179

the analyses.

180

Quantification of sequence variability by H calculation indicated that B cell epitopes in the S protein

181

are significantly more variable than non-epitopes for SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1

182

(Figure 4). Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes in these viruses indicated no increased diversity

183

for epitope compared to non-epitope positions, with the exclusion of the S protein of SARS-CoV for

184

CD4+ T cells. However, when positions within B cell epitopes were excluded from the analysis, this

185

difference disappeared and T cell epitopes were found to be significantly less variable than non-

186

epitopes for the spike proteins of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for the N protein of

187

HCoV-229E (figure 4). Thus, the lack of antigenic diversity at T cell epitopes is a common feature of

188

human coronaviruses, which instead tend to maintain sequence conservation of such epitopes.

189
190

Discussion

191

The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still uncertain and it is presently unknown whether the virus spilled over

192

from a bat or another intermediate host. The hypothesis of a zoonotic origin is strongly supported by

193

multiple lines of evidence, although it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 transmitted cryptically in

194

humans before gaining the ability of spreading efficiently among people (Andersen et al., 2020; Sironi

195

et al., 2020). Whatever the initial events associated with the early phases of the pandemic, it is clear

196

that circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses shared a common ancestor at the end of 2019 (Li et al., 2020; van

197

Dorp et al., 2020). Due to its recent origin, the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 population is still

198

limited. This is also the result of the relatively low mutation rate of coronaviruses (as compared to other

199

RNA viruses), which encode enzymes with some proofreading ability (Denison et al., 2011; Forni et

200

al., 2017). Nonetheless, the huge number of transmissions worldwide have allowed thousands of

201

mutations to appear in the viral population and, thanks to enormous international sequencing efforts,

202

more than 14,000 amino acid replacements have currently been reported (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk).

203

Irrespective of the host, most variants are expected to be deleterious for viral fitness, or to have no

204

consequences (Cagliani et al., 2020; Grubaugh et al., 2020; van Dorp et al., 2020). However, a portion

205

of replacements may favor the virus and some of these may contribute to adaptation to the human host.

206

In particular, the recent and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be at least partially

207

driven by the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. Indeed, antigenic drift or

208

immune evasion mutations have been reported for other zoonotic viruses such as Lassa virus (Andersen

209

et al., 2015) and Influenza A virus (Su et al., 2015). The emergence of immune evasion variants was

210

also observed during an outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea, when mutations in the spike proteins

211

were positively selected as they facilitated viral escape from neutralizing antibodies, even though the

212

same variants decreased binding to the cellular receptor (Kim et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Kleine-

213

Weber et al., 2019; Rockx et al., 2010). This exemplifies a phenomenon often observed in other

214

viruses, most notably HIV-1 (Liu et al., 2007; Martinez-Picado et al., 2006; Schneidewind et al., 2007;

215

Schneidewind et al., 2008), whereby the virus trades off immune evasion with a fitness cost. As a

216

consequence, immune evasion mutations may be only transiently maintained in viral populations. For

217

this reason we decided to quantify epitope variability in terms of entropy, rather than relying on

218

measures based on substitution rates (dN/dS), which were developed for application to variants that go

219

to fixation in different lineages over time (Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin, 2008).

220

The MERS-CoV mutants responsible for the outbreak in South Korea also testify the relevance of the

221

antibody response in coronavirus control and the selective pressure imposed by humoral immunity on

222

the virus (Kim et al., 2019; Kleine-Weber et al., 2019; Rockx et al., 2010). This is most likely the case

223

for SARS-CoV-2, as well, as recent report indicated that the sera of most COVID-19 convalescent

224

patients have virus-neutralization activities and antibody titers negatively correlate with viral load

225

(OKBA et al., 2020; Vabret et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). Nonetheless, studies on

226

relatively large COVID-19 patient cohorts reported that patients with severe disease display stronger

227

IgG responses than milder cases and a negative correlation between anti-S antibody titers and

228

lymphocyte counts was reported (Jiang et al., 2020; Vabret et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,

229

2020a; Zhao et al., 2020). Consistently, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were recently

230

reported to have lower virus-specific IgG levels than COVID-19 patients (Long et al., 2020). These

231

observations raised concerns that humoral responses might not necessarily be protective, but rather

232

pathogenic, either via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or other mechanisms (Cao, 2020;

233

Iwasaki and Yang, 2020; Wu et al., 2020).

234

Clearly, gaining insight into the dynamic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the human immune

235

system is of fundamental importance not only to understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, but also

236

to inform therapeutic and preventive viral control strategies. We thus exploited the availability of a

237

large number of fully sequenced high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as validated predictions

238

of B cell and T cell epitopes, to investigate whether the selective pressure exerted by the adaptive

239

immune response is detectable in global SARS-CoV-2 population, and if the virus is evolving to evade

240

it. Results indicated that B cell epitopes in the N and S proteins, which represent the major targets of

241

the antibody response, have higher diversity than non-epitope positions. The same was observed for the

242

spike proteins of HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV, although data on the latter virus should

243

be taken with caution as they derive from a relatively small number of sequences sampled over a short

244

time frame. Conversely, no evidence of antibody-mediated selective pressure was evident for HCoV-

245

229E and HCoV-NL63. The reasons underlying these differences are unclear, but recent data on a

246

relatively small population of patients with respiratory disease indicated that the titers of neutralizing

247

antibodies against HCoV-OC43 tend to be higher compared to those against HCoV-229E and HCoV-

248

NL63 (HCoV-HKU1 was not evaluated), suggesting the two latter viruses elicit mainly non-

249

B cell epitopes within nsp16 were also found to be variable, although this protein was not reported to

251

be immunogenic (Grifoni et al., 2020b). However, the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has presently

252

been systematically analyzed in a relatively small number of patients and most studies focused on

253

structural proteins. It is thus possible that, during infection, antibodies against nsp16 are raised but they

254

have not been detected yet. An alternative possibility is that B cell epitopes in nsp16, which is highly

255

conserved in SARS-CoV-2 strains (Cagliani et al., 2020), coincide with regions of relatively weaker

256

constraint. This hypothesis is partially supported by the observation that these same positions also

257

display higher diversity when entropy is calculated on an alignment of sarbecovirus nsp16 proteins.

258

More intriguingly, this result may indicate that nsp16, together with S and N, is a target of B cell

259

responses in the bat reservoirs. In fact, as mentioned above, antibody binding sites tend to be conserved

260

across species (Tse et al., 2017; Wiehe et al., 2014) and thus the selective pressure exerted on B cell

261

epitopes is likely to be constant across hosts. Whereas the immunogenicity of nsp16 remains to be

262

evaluated, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to elude the host humoral immune

263

response. We however note that this observation does not necessarily imply that antibodies against

264

SARS-CoV-2 are protective and it does not rule out the possibility that humoral responses contribute to

265

COVID-19 pathogenesis.

266

In COVID-19 patients, antibody titers were found to correlate with the strength of virus-specific T cell

267

responses (Ni et al., 2020). Surprisingly, we found that, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for

268

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are not more variable than non-epitope positions. Conversely, a significant

269

reduction in epitope variability was observed for a subset of viral proteins, in particular for some of the

270

most immunogenic ones (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a) (Grifoni et al., 2020b; Peng et al., 2020a). To check

271

that the result was not due to stronger structural/functional constraints acting on epitope positions, we

272

again used H values calculated on an alignment of sarbecovirus genomes, all of which, with the

273

exclusion of SARS-CoV, were sampled in bats. T cell responses are initiated by the presentation of

274

antigenic epitopes by MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I and class II molecules. Different

275

mammals have diverse MHC gene repertoires and thus present distinct antigens. In particular, recent

276

data from various bat species indicated that many MHC class I molecules have a 3- or 5-amino acid

277

insertion in the peptide binding pocket, resulting in very different presented peptide repertoires

278

compared to the MHC class I molecules of other mammals (Abduriyim et al., 2019; Lu, Dan AND Liu,

280

Chai, Yan AND Qi, Jianxun AND Wang, Lin-Fa AND Gao, George F. AND Liu,William J., 2019; Ng et

281

al., 2016; Papenfuss et al., 2012; Wynne et al., 2016) . Thus, the selective pressure acting on T cell

282

epitopes is most likely volatile and not conserved in humans and bats. Analysis of sarbecovirus proteins

283

indicated that, apart from CD4+ T cell epitopes in the N protein, the T cell epitopes predicted in SARS-

284

CoV-2 proteins are not less diverse than non-epitope positions, suggesting that epitope conservation is

285

not simply secondary to structural or functional constraints, but may result from interaction with human

286

T cell responses. Of course, another possible explanation for this finding is that the prediction tools

287

failed to identify real epitopes. However, we retrieved epitopes from a previous work and the authors

288

validated their predictions using the sera of 20 patients who recovered from COVID-19 (Grifoni et al.,

289

2020a; Grifoni et al., 2020b). Moreover, if a general artifact linked to epitope prediction was

290

introduced, we would not expect to observe significant differences and not specifically in the proteins

291

that represent the major targets of T cell responses.

292

Unexpected conservation of T cell epitopes was previously observed for HIV-1 and Mycobacteriun

293

tuberculosis (MTB), both of which cause chronic infections in humans (Comas et al., 2010; Coscolla et

294

al., 2015; Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2015; Sanjuán, Rafael AND Nebot, Miguel R. AND Peris, Joan

295

B. AND Alcamí,José, 2013). In the case of HIV-1, immune activation most likely favors the virus by

296

increasing the rate of CD4+ T cell trans-infection (Sanjuán, Rafael AND Nebot, Miguel R. AND Peris,

297

Joan B. AND Alcamí,José, 2013). Conversely, the mechanisms underlying MTB epitope conservation

298

are not fully elucidated. A possible explanation is that conserved epitopes generate a decoy immune

299

response and advantage the bacterium. An alternative possibility is that T cell activation results in lung

300

tissue inflammation and damage (cavitary tuberculosis), which favors MTB transmission by aerosol

301

(Coscolla et al., 2015; Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2015). Although these mechanisms are unlikely to be

302

at play in the case of SARS-CoV-2, a deregulated immune response has been associated with COVID13

303

19 pathogenesis (Hannan et al., 2020). Specifically, recent data indicated that patients recovering from

304

severe COVID-19 have broader and stronger T cell responses compared to mild cases (Peng et al.,

305

2020b). This was particularly evident for responses against the S, membrane (M), ORF3a, and ORF8

306

proteins (Peng et al., 2020b). Although this observation might simply reflect higher viral loads in

307

severe cases, the possibility that the T cell response itself is deleterious cannot be excluded. Moreover,

308

the same authors reported that CD8+ T cells targeting different virus proteins have distinct cytokine

309

profiles, suggesting that the virus can modulate the host immune response to its benefit (Peng et al.,

310

2020b). Additionally, a post-mortem study on six patients who died from COVID-19 indicated that

311

infection of macrophages can lead to activation-induced T cell death, which may eventually be

312

responsible for lymphocytopenia (chen et al., 2020). However, we also found a trend of lower diversity

313

of T cell epitopes for common cold coronaviruses, indicating that epitope conservation per se is not

314

directly linked to disease severity. Moreover, other SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic proteins such as M and

315

ORF7 did not show differences in T cell epitope conservation, which was instead observed for nsp16

316

and nsp15. These latter are not known to be T cell targets (Grifoni et al., 2020b). Clearly, further

317

analyses will be required to clarify the significance of T cell epitope conservation in SARS-CoV-2. An

318

interesting possibility is that both for SARS-CoV-2 and for common cold coronaviruses, conservation

319

serves to maintain epitopes that elicit tolerizing T cell responses or induce T cells with regulatory

320

activity. Indeed, we considered T cell epitopes as a whole, but differences exist in terms of variability

321

and, most likely, antigenicity. This clearly represents a limitation of this study, but the modest amount

322

of genetic diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 population does not presently allow analysis of single epitope

323

regions. Moreover, more detailed and robust analyses will indubitably require the systematic,

324

experimental definition of T and B cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.

Material and Methods

328

Epitope Prediction

329

Epitope prediction was performed using different tools from The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)

330

(https://www.iedb.org/), as previously suggested (Grifoni et al., 2020a). Protein sequences from

331

reference strains of human coronaviruses were used as input for all prediction analyses (SARS-CoV-2,

332

NC_045512; SARS-CoV, NC_004718; Human coronavirus 229E, NC_002645; Human coronavirus

333

NL63, NC_005831; Human coronavirus OC43, NC_006213; Human coronavirus HKU1, NC_006577).

334

In particular, for linear B cell epitope prediction, we used the Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction 2.0

335

tool (Jespersen et al., 2017) with a cutoff of 0.550 and epitope length > 7. Conformational B epitopes

336

for the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using Discotope 2.0 (Kringelum et al., 2012)

337

with a threshold = -2.5 and published 3D protein structures (PDB IDs: 6VSB, spike; 6M3M (N-term)

338

and 7C22 (C-term), nucleocapsid protein).

339

SARS-CoV-2 predicted T cell epitopes were retrieved from a previous work (Grifoni et al., 2020a). For

340

all other coronaviruses, we applied the same methodology used by Grifoni et al. (Grifoni et al., 2020a).

341

CD4+ cell epitopes were predicted using TepiTool (Paul et al., 2016) with default parameters. CD8+

342

epitopes were predicted by using MHC-I Binding Predictions v2.23 tool (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/).

343

The NetMHCpan EL 4.0 method (Jurtz et al., 2017) was applied and the 12 most frequent HLA class I

344

alleles in human populations (HLA-A01:01, HLA-A02:01, HLA-A03:01, HLA-A11:01, HLA-A23:01,

345

HLA-A24:02, HLA-B07:02, HLA-B08:01, HLA-B35:01, HLA-B40:01, HLA-B44:02, HLA-B44:03)

346

were analyzed with a 8-14 kmer range. Only epitopes with a score rank ≤ 0.1 in one of the 12 HLA

347

classes were selected.

350

SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were downloaded from the GISAID Initiative (https://www.gisaid.org)

351

database (as of June, 5th). All protein sequences were retrieved and several filters were applied. Only

352

complete genomes flagged as “high coverage only” and “human” were selected. Positions

353

recommended to be masked by DeMaio and coworkers (https://virological.org/t/masking-strategies-for-

354

sars-cov-2-alignments/480, last accessed June, 5th, 2020) were also removed.

355

Finally, for each SARS-CoV-2 protein, we selected only strains that had the same length as the protein

356

in the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain (NC_045512), generating a set of at least 23625 sequences for

357

each ORF. Proteins with less than 60 amino acids were excluded from the analyses.

358

The list of GISAID IDs along with the list of laboratories which generated the data is provided as Table

359

S5.

360

For all the other human coronaviruses, as well as for a set of non-human infecting sarbecoviruses,

361

sequences of either complete genome or single ORFs (i.e. nucleocapsid and spike protein) were

362

retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBI,

363

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For all human coronaviruses, the only filter we applied was the host

364

identification as “human”. SARS-CoV strains sampled during the second outbreak were excluded from

365

the analyses. NCBI ID identifiers are listed as Table S2 and Table S4.

366

Alignments were generated using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013).

367
368

Protein variability and statistical analysis

369

Variability at each amino acid position was estimated using the Shannon's entropy (H) index using the

370

Shannon Entropy-One tool from the HIV database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index), with

371

ambiguous character (e.g. gaps) excluded from the analysis. For SARS-CoV-2 strains, H was calculated

372

on alignments of 10000 randomly selected sequences for each protein. For each protein we evaluated

373

the difference D between average H values at epitope and non-epitope positions.

374

Most positions of analyzed viruses are invariable along the alignments, so the distribution of H is zero-

375

inflated. We thus calculated statistical significance by permutations. For each protein, the predicted

376

epitope intervals were collapsed to a single position while non-epitope intervals were left unchanged.

377

After randomly shuffling this collapsed sequence it was expanded back to full length and the difference

378

between shuffled epitope and non-epitope H values was calculated. This procedure was repeated 1000

379

times and the proportion of repetitions showing a difference more extreme than D was reported as p-

380

value. An in house R script was written and is available as supplementary text S1.
