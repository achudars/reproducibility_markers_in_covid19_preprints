To date, the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than

21

SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire

22

open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients

23

in Singapore. The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence

24

(TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also

25

found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks.

26

During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in

27

the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-

28

related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or

29

deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the

30

virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the

31

outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that

32

may be associated with host adaptation [1]. We therefore hypothesise that the major

33

deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2.

34
35

On 1 December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged from Hubei province in China and

36

infected people visiting the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan [3]. The virus demonstrated

37

efficient human-to-human transmission within mainland China and subsequently spread

38

across many countries. The virus was soon identified as 2019-nCoV, more recently

39

designated SARS-CoV-2, while the disease is referred to as COVID-19. On 30 January 2020,

40

the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International

41

Concern. As of 10 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to 113,702 confirmed cases

42

and 4,012 deaths globally [4]. Zoonotic viruses have crossed the species barrier from animals

43

to humans and the success of an interspecies transmission is the ability of a novel virus to

44

adapt, via genetic mutation events, to a new host and cause sustained transmission that can

45

lead to a significant outbreak.

46
47

Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from hospitalized patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 in

48

Singapore were subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis, with and without

49

passaging in Vero-E6 cells. The NGS data revealed a 382-nt deletion towards the 3’ end of

50

the viral genomes obtained from multiple patients (Suppl. Table 1). To confirm this

51

observation, specific PCR primers were designed flanking the deleted region and Sanger

52

sequencing performed (Suppl. Fig. 1). This verified the deletion at positions 27,848 to 28,229

53

of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interrogation of the NGS assemblies of these 382-nt deletion

54

variants (referred to hereafter as ∆382) indicated that the virus populations were

55

homogenous.

56
57

Apart from the 382-nt deletion, the genome organization of the ∆382 viruses is identical to

58

that of other SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A). Closer examination of the deletion indicated that it

59

spans an area of the ORF7b and ORF8 that includes the ORF8 transcriptional regulator

60

sequence (TRS), eliminating ORF8 transcription (Fig. 1B). The ORF8 region has been

61

identified as an evolutionary hotspot of SARSr-CoVs. For instance, sequences of human

62

SARS-CoV TOR2 and LC2 exhibit 29-nt and 415-nt deletions, whereas those of bat SARS-

63

CoV JTMC15 have discontinuous deletions in ORF7/8 (Fig. 1B) [5-8]. The ORF8 region of

64

SARS-CoVs has been shown to play a significant role in adaptation to the human host

65

following interspecies transmission [7] and virus replicative efficiency [2]. Similarly the

66

disruption of ORF8 region in ∆382 viruses may be a result of human adaptation after the

67

emergence of SARS-CoV-2.

69

To investigate the possible effects of the TRS deletion, we calculated and compared the total

70

number of transcripts per million (TPM) of each gene between wild-type (WT) and ∆382

71

viruses. For each gene, we counted unambiguous reads that uniquely mapped to the gene-

72

specific transcripts that include the joint leader and TRS sequences [9]. We analysed three

73

WT and two ∆382 sequences for which two independent NGS library preparations were

74

available. Our results indicate differential patterns of TPM level between WT and ∆382

75

viruses (Fig. 2A). The ∆382 sequences displayed a greater level of TPMs in the ORF6,

76

ORF7a and N genes compared to WT. More specifically, the ∆382 N gene, downstream of

77

ORF8, showed a significant increase in the TPM level. To further determine the impact of the

78

382-nt deletion on the transcription of the N gene, we conducted qPCR to measure the

79

relative abundance of the RNAs from 2 genes (E and N) located upstream and downstream of

80

the deleted region, respectively. Results shown in Figure 2B confirm the enhancement of N

81

gene transcription in ∆382 viruses. This enhancement was consistently observed regardless of

82

the sample type, whether directly from swab samples or passaged viruses.

83
84

The global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 (Suppl. Fig. 2) revealed a comb-like appearance in

85

the phylogenetic tree and a general lack of phylogenetic resolution, reflecting the high

86

similarity of the virus genomes. This tree topology is a typical characteristic of a novel

87

interspecies transmission, wherein the viruses are infecting immunologically naïve

88

populations with sustained human-to-human transmission, as previously shown for the early

89

stages of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [10]. Notably, we observe an emerging virus lineage

90

(tentatively designated as “Lineage 1” in Suppl. Fig. 2) that consists of sequences from

91

various newly affected countries with recent virus introductions. All viruses from this recent

92

lineage possess an amino acid substitution at residue 250 (from lysine to serine) on the ORF8

93

gene [11], which is known to undergo strong positive selection during animal-to-human

94

transmission [7].

95
96

To estimate the divergence times among lineages of SARS-CoV-2, we reconstructed a dated

97

phylogeny based on 137 complete genomes, including data from this study. The estimated

98

rate of nucleotide substitutions among SARS-CoV-2 viruses is approximately at 8.68×10-4

99

substitutions per site per year (95% HPD: 5.44×10-4 –1.22×10-3), which is moderately lower

100

than SARS-CoV ([12]: 0.80–2.38×10-3) and MERS-CoV (with a mean rate [13] of: 1.12×10-3

101

and 95% HPD: 58.76×10-4 –1.37×10-3) as well as human seasonal influenza viruses (ranging

102

1.0–5.5×10-3 depending on individual gene segments [10, 14-16]. In contrast, the estimated

103

rate of SARS-CoV-2 viruses is greater than estimates for human coronaviruses by a

104

magnitude order of 4×10-4 [17].

105
106

The mean TMRCA estimates indicate the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into humans (Fig. 3.

107

node A) occurred in the middle of November 2019 (95% HPD: 2019.77–2019.94) (Table 1),

108

suggesting that the viruses were present in human hosts approximately one month before the

109

outbreak was detected. A single amino-acid mutation was fixed on the ORF8 region of all

110

full-genome Lineage 1 viruses (Fig. 3, node B), with the TMRCA estimate of 22 December

111

2019 (95% HPD: 2019.9–2020.0). The ∆382 viruses form a monophyletic group within

112

Lineage 1, and dating estimates indicate that they may have arisen in the human population in

113

Singapore around 07 February 2020 (95% HPD: 2020.12–2020.06), consistent with the date

114

of collection of the ∆382 positive samples (17–19 February 2020). The three ∆382 viruses

115

shared a high level of nucleotide similarities (99.9%) with only 5 nucleotide differences

116

between them. Although the dated phylogeny indicates that ∆382 viruses clustered together

117

and are possibly derived from a single source, there is a general lack of statistical support in

118

SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies due to its recent emergence, and evolutionary inferences should be

119

made with caution.

120
121

In this report we describe the first major evolutionary event of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

122

following its emergence into the human population. Although the biological consequences of

123

this deletion remain unknown, the alteration of the N gene transcription would suggest this

124

may have an impact on virus phenotype. Recent work has indicated that ORF8 of SARS-CoV

125

plays a functional role in virus replicative fitness and may be associated with attenuation

126

during the early stages of human-to-human transmission [2]. Given the prevalence of a

127

variety of deletions in the ORF8 of SARSr-CoVs, it is likely that we will see further deletion

128

variants emerge with the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Future research

129

should focus on the phenotypic consequences of ∆382 viruses in the transmission dynamics

130

of the current epidemics and the immediate application of this genomic marker for molecular

131

epidemiological investigation.

205

To understand possible effects of the TRS deletion on the ORF8 region, we analysed the total

206

number of transcripts per million (TPM) of each gene between wildtype and ∆382 variants.

207

For each gene, unambiguous reads which uniquely mapped to the specific joint leader and

208

TRS sequences are counted. We analysed three patients of SARS-CoV-2 wild type and two

209

patients of SARS-CoV-2 variants and independent NGS library preparations were performed

210

twice for each sample. The Wuhan-Hu-1 was used as the reference sequence for genomic

211

coordinates. Leader RNA sequence is situated at the 5’ UTR region of the genome and the

212

core sequence consists of 26 nt: UCUCUAAACGAACUUUAAAAUCUGUG. Each of the

213

coding genes is preceded by a core transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) which is highly

214

conserved (i.e. ACGAAC), resembling the leader core sequence. The leader RNA is joined to

215

the TRS regions of different genes and the joining is required for driving subgenomic

216

transcription. Coding sequence (CDS), leader and TRS sequences annotations were generated

217

in Geneious and followed published SARS-CoV studies [9]. To characterize the differential

218

levels of TRS for each gene, 70 nt leader sequence and 230 nt downstream of each TRS

219

sequence were annotated individually to form a 300bp leader-TRS transcript for the splicing-

220

aware aligners in R package rtracklayer (v 1.44). NGS raw fastq reads were then mapped to

221

the reference genome by Geneious RNA-Seq mapper with the annotation of splice-junctions

222

for the leader-TRS. For each gene, the TPM of leader-TRS was then calculated in Geneious

223

by excluding ambiguous reads which may come from other TRS. The resulting TPM data

224

was generated in Geneious and graphs plotted using ggplot 2 (v3.2.0) in R v3.6.1. Wilcoxon

225

one-sided tests were performed in R to test the significant differences between WT and ∆382

226

samples. We also compared individual Ct values of E and N genes between WT and ∆382

227

viruses using qRT-PCR assays as previously described [18]. Samples used in this analysis

228

included nasopharyngeal swabs from three WT patient samples and both nasopharyngeal

229

swabs and passaged samples from two ∆382 patients (n=7). Significance between groups was

230

assessed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in PRISM v8.3.1.

231
232

Phylogenetic analyses. All available genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with associated virus

233

sampling dates were downloaded from the GISAID database. Genome sequence alignment

234

was performed and preliminary maximum likelihood phylogenies of complete genome were

235

reconstructed using RAxML with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in Geneious R9.0.3 software

236

(Biomatters Ltd). Any sequence outliers were removed from subsequent analyses. To

237

reconstruct a time-scaled phylogeny, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock model with an

238

exponential growth coalescent prior and the HKY85+Γ substitution model was used in the

239

program BEAST v1.10.4 [20] to simultaneously estimate phylogeny, divergence times and

240

rates of nucleotide substitution. Four independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs

241

of 100 million generations were performed and sampled every 10,000 generations. The runs

242

were checked for convergence in Tracer v1.7 [21] and that effective sampling size (ESS)

243

values of all parameters was >200. The resulting log and tree files were combined after

244

removing appropriate burn-in values using LogCombiner [20], and the maximum clade

245

credibility (MCC) tree was subsequently generated using TreeAnnontator [20].

Figure 2. Comparison of transcription of the transcription of the N gene in wild-type (WT) versus
∆382 viruses. A. Abundance of mapped reads relative to transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS)
positions across the genome. 70 bp of leader sequence and 230 of each TRS-downstream sequence
were merged in a splice-junction in the annotation. Transcripts per million reads (TPM) was calculated
from reads mapped specifically to each leader-TRS region and a whisker and scatter plot was drawn for
each gene. A Wilcoxon test was applied to the TPM for each gene of ∆382 to WT (*: p ≤ 0.05 **: p ≤ 0.01).
B. Relative abundance of the RNAs of the E gene in comparison to the N gene of WT versus ∆382
SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.002) using qPCR. Horizontal bars indicate the mean of each group.
