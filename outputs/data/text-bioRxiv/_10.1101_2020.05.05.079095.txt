Summary Paragraph
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused already over 3.5 million COVID-19 cases and 250,000 deaths
globally. There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human
disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As
primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using
human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids,
particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of
chemokines and cytokines with little type I/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed
amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using
hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib
and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these
drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung
organoids. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-derived lung cells infected by SARS-CoV2 can model human COVID-19 disease and provide a valuable resource to screen for FDAapproved drugs that might be repurposed and should be considered for COVID-19 clinical trials.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global event that requires the immediate
deployment of effective clinical therapeutics while vaccine candidates are identified and tested.
Arguably the most rapid means of addressing this issue is through the repurposing of existing drugs
that are FDA-approved which may indirectly interfere with aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology.
While this strategy is being pursued, most high throughput screens focus on the use of transformed
cell lines which fail to capture the physiologically relevant dynamics of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In an effort to improve on these cell lines, we developed and describe here lung organoids as an
improved in vitro platform for screening purposes.
In the last several years, a series of protocols have been reported to direct hPSC differentiation to
various lung lineages1-14. We differentiated hPSCs to lung organoids using a previously reported
stepwise strategy4,15, including the progressive differentiation first into definitive endoderm (DE),
followed by specification to anterior foregut endoderm (AFE), AFE/lung progenitor cells (LPs),
and finally lung organoids (Extended Data Fig. 1). Single cell transcriptomic profiles were
generated and analyzed in the differentiated lung organoids at day 50 and identified alveolar type
II (AT2) cells (SP-B+, SP-D+, ABCA3+), alveolar type I (AT1) cells (PDPN+APQ5+), stromal cells,
and proliferating cells (Fig. 1a, 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2b). We also detected a low number
of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (ASCL1+, CALCA+) and airway epithelial cells (Fig. 1a and
Extended Data Fig. 2a, 2b). ACE2, the putative receptor for SARS-CoV-216, is mainly detected
in cluster 1, which represents AT2 cells (Fig. 1c, 1d). TMPRSS2, a key transmembrane protease
for SARS-CoV-2 infection16, is also enriched in AT2 cells and AT1 cells (Fig. 1c, 1d). Consistent
with scRNA-seq data of adult lung17, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression are detected in only a subset of the AT2 cells, likely due to the depth limitation of 10X scRNA-seq. Immunostaining results
further validated that ACE2 is expressed in SP-B+/SP-C+ AT2 cells (Fig. 1e).

To determine the relative permissiveness of hPSC-derived lung organoids to SARS-CoV-2 viral
entry, we first used a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) based SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, for
which the backbone was provided by a VSV-G pseudo-typed Î”G-luciferase virus with the SARSCoV-2 Spike protein incorporated at the surface of the viral particle (See Methods for details)18,19.
Robust luciferase activity was readily detected in the infected hPSC-derived lung organoids (Fig.
1f).

To generate an in vivo model using human lung organoids, we implanted subcutaneously day 25
lung progenitor cells in immuno-deficient NSG mice (Fig. 1g). Within 4 months the xenografts
developed organized alveolar-like structures (Fig. 1h). Immunostaining confirms the existence of
SP-B+ AT2 cells, which co-express ACE2 (Fig. 1i). Infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus
was tested in this mouse model carrying hPSC-derived lung xenografts. Expression of luciferase
from the SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus was detected by immunofluorescence staining 24 hours
after intra-xenograft inoculation (1X104 FFU). LUC is mainly detected in SP-B+ AT2 cells (Fig.
1j).

The potential of the hPSC-derived lung organoid platform to model COVID-19 was then tested by
infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cultures. 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) with the SARSCoV-2 virus (USA-WA1/2020, MOI=0.01), qRT-PCR using primers targeting N sgRNA
transcripts confirmed that a significant amount of replicating viral RNA was detected in the
infected lung organoids (Fig. 2a). Immunostaining confirmed the detection of SARS-S protein in

the infected lung organoids (Fig. 2b). At 24 hpi, RNA-seq was performed on mock and SARSCoV-2 infected cells. Alignment with the viral genome confirmed robust viral replication in hPSCderived lung organoids (Fig. 2c). Moreover, plotting these datasets by principle component
analysis (PCA) suggested that the infected lung organoids clustered distinctly compared to mockinfected lung organoids (Fig. 2d). Volcano plots of SARS-CoV-2 infected hPSC-derived lung
organoids compared to mock treatment revealed robust induction of chemokines and cytokines
with no detectable levels of type I and III IFNs (Fig. 2e). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
comparing mock-infected versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung organoids revealed over-represented
pathway networks including TNF signaling, IL-17 signaling, chemokine signaling pathway, and
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Fig. 2f). These profiles were further compared with
primary tissues from healthy and COVID-19 patients. Compared with healthy lung, lung tissues
of COVID-19 patients revealed robust induction of chemokines, including CXCl2, CCL2, CXCL3
as well as IL1A, BCRC3, AADAC, and ATPB4 (Fig. 2g), which is markedly similar to SARS-CoV2 infected lung organoids. Finally, IL-17 signaling was also found to be significantly changed in
lung tissues of COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infected lung organoids
(Fig. 2h).

To identify drug candidates capable of blocking SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus infection, hPSCderived lung organoids were deposited onto 384-well plates. After six hour of incubation,
organoids were treated at 10 Î¼M with a library of FDA-approved drugs (the Prestwick collection).
Two hour post-treatment, the organoids were innoculated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus
at MOI=0.01. At 24 hpi, the organoids were analyzed for luciferase activity. The wells in which Z
score<-2 were chosen as primary hit drugs (Fig. 3a). The hits were evaluated for efficacy and

cytotoxicity at different concentrations. Four drugs were confirmed to block luciferase activity in
a dose-dependent manner, independent of cytotoxicity, including imatinib (EC50=4.86 Î¼M,
IC50=37.3 Î¼M Fig. 3b, 3e), mycophenolic acid (MPA, EC50=0.15 Î¼M, Fig. 3c, 3f), quinacrine
dihydrochloride (QNHC, EC50=2.83 Î¼M, IC50=22 Î¼M, Fig. 3d, 3g), chloroquine (EC50=3.85 Î¼M),
and prochlorperazine (EC50=23.7 Î¼M, IC50=30 Î¼M) (Extended Data Fig. 3). Interestingly, three
hit compounds, MPA, QNHC, and chloroquine, were also identified from our independent screen
using hPSC-derived colonic organoids20. Immunostaining confirmed a significant diminishment
of LUC+ cells detected among SP-C+ AT2 cells in lung organoids treated with 10 ÂµM imatinib, 3
ÂµM MPA or 4.5 ÂµM QNHC at 24 hpi (Fig. 3h).

To evaluate the drug activities in vivo, we used humanized mice carrying hPSC-derived lung
xenografts after 4 months maturation in vivo (Fig. 3i). The humanized mice were treated with 400
mg/kg imatinib mesylate, 50 mg/kg MPA, or 25 mg/kg QNHC. 3 hours post-treatment, SARSCoV-2 pseudo-entry virus (1X104 FFU) was delivered by intra-xenograft inoculation. At 24 hpi,
luciferase staining was detected in mice treated with vehicle. The number of LUC+ cells was
significantly decreased in mice treated with imatinib mesylate, MPA or QNHC (Fig. 3j, 3k).

Finally, hPSC-derived lung organoids pre-treated with 10 ÂµM imatinib, 3 ÂµM MPA or 4.5 ÂµM
QNHC were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI=0.5. At 24 hpi, qRT-PCR confirmed
significantly decreased replicating viral RNA in lung organoids treated with imatinib, MPA or
QNHC (Fig. 4a). Immunostaining confirmed a significant loss of SARS-CoV-2+ cells in imatinib,
MPA or QNHC-treated hPSC derived-lung organoids (Fig. 4b). To determine the therapeutic

potential of imatinib, MPA and QNHC, hPSC-derived lung organoids were infected with SARSCoV-2 virus (MOI=0.5). Three hours later, lung organoids were treated with 10 ÂµM imatinib, 3
ÂµM MPA or 4.5 ÂµM QNHC. At 24 hpi, both viral RNA (Fig. 4c) and SARS-CoV-2+ cells (Fig.
4d) were significantly decreased in the lung organoids treated with each drug, highlighting the
therapeutic potential. Transcriptional profiling was applied to compare DMSO and imatinibtreated lung organoids, and PCA plots showed these clustered separately (Fig. 4e). Volcano plots
and GSEA analysis highlight the change of pathways caused by imatinib, related to fatty acid
biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and PPAR signaling pathway (Fig. 4f,
4g). Viruses have been known to target lipid signaling, synthesis, and metabolism to remodel their
host cells into an optimal environment for their replication. Fatty acid is involved in multiple steps
of viral circle, including membrane fusion during the entry process, virion envelopment during
particle maturation, as well as virus replication21. The fact that fatty acid biosynthesis and
metabolism pathways are changed in the imatinib-treated lung organoids suggests that imatinib
might also affect virus replication and particle maturation. Finally, qRT-PCR and western blotting
experiments confirmed the ability of imatinib to block anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Vero cells
(Extended Data Fig. 4).

The lung is the most vulnerable target organ for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and respiratory failure is
the primary disease outcome for COVID-19. Yet the primary model currently used for SARSCoV-2 studies are African green monkey kidney derived Vero cells, which have clear limitations
for modeling complex human pulmonary or other organ systems. Therefore, the development of
physiologically relevant human cell models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection is critically important.
Here, we present an hPSC-derived lung organoid platform, including SP-B+ AT2 cells that express

ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two key factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is consistent
with the previous reports22. RNA-seq of infected organoids revealed upregulation of
cytokine/chemokine signaling, which phenocopies the cytokine and chemokine changes observed
in primary human COVID-19 pulmonary infection23. Finally, we used the hPSC-derived lung
organoids in a high throughput screen for FDA-approved drugs. We identified several drugs that
decreased the luciferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus including imatinib, MPA and
QNHC, both in vitro and in vivo. The anti-viral activity of these drugs was further validated against
patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Imatinib is an inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes, including Abl, c-kit, PDGF-R and
others. Previous studies have also suggested imatinib as a potent inhibitor of SARS and MERS
coronavirus fusion proteins24. Using HIV SARS-S and MERS-S pseudotyped virions, imatinib
was shown to substantially block coronavirus S protein-induced fusion and prevent endosomal
entry25. Imatinib has been widely used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and other cancers,
and should be considered for repurposing as a drug candidate for COVID-19 patients. Very
recently, three clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04346147, NCT04357613,
NCT04356495) were registered to apply imatinib to treat COVID-19 patients. Our study provides

experimental data to support these trials.

Methods.
hPSC lung differentiation.
Protocols for maintenance of hPSCs and generation of lung cells were slightly modified from
previous studies4,15. The hESC line RUES2 was cultured on irradiated mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (Global Stem, cat. no. GSC-6001G) at a density of 20,000- 25,000 cells/cm2 in a
medium of DMEM/F12, 20% knockout serum replacement (Life Technologies), 0.1 mM Î²mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml bFGF (R&D Systems), and medium was changed
daily. hESC cultures were maintained in an undifferentiated state at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2/air
environment until stem cells reached about 90% confluence.

hESC differentiation into endoderm was performed in serum-free differentiation (SFD) medium
of DMEM/F12 (3:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with N2 (Life Technologies), B27, 50
Î¼g/ml ascorbic acid, 2 mM Glutamax, 0.4 Î¼M monothioglycerol, 0.05% BSA at 37 Â°C in a 5%
CO2/5% O2/95% N2 environment. hESCs were treated with Accutase and plated onto low
attachment 6-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Tewksbury MA), resuspended in endoderm
induction medium containing 10 Î¼M Y-27632, 0.5 ng/ml human BMP-4, 2.5 ng/ml human bFGF,
100 ng/ml human Activin A, for 72-84 hours dependent on the formation rates of endoderm cells.
On day 3 or 3.5, the endoderm bodies were dissociated into single cells using 0.05% Trypsin/0.02%
EDTA and plated onto fibronectin-coated, 24-well tissue culture plates (~100,000â€“150,000
cells/well). For induction of anterior foregut endoderm, the endoderm cells were cultured in SFD
medium supplemented with 1.5 Î¼M dorsomorphin dihydrochloride (R&D Systems) and 10 Î¼M
SB431542 (R&D Systems) for 36-48 h, and then switched to 36-48 h of 10 Î¼M SB431542 and 1

Î¼M IWP2 (R&D Systems) treatment. For induction of early stage lung progenitor cells (day 6â€“
15), the resulting anterior foregut endoderm was treated with 3 Î¼M CHIR99021, 10 ng/ml human
FGF10, 10 ng/ml human FGF-7, 10 ng/ml human BMP-4 and 50-60 nM all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA), in SFD medium for 8â€“10 d. The day 10â€“15 cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2/air
environment. On days 15 and 16, the lung field progenitor cells were replated after one minute
trypsinization onto fibronectin-coated plates, in the presence of SFD containing either a
combination of five factors (3 Î¼M CHIR99021, 10 ng/ml human FGF10, 10 ng/ml human FGF7,
10 ng/ml human BMP-4, and 50 nM ATRA), or three factors (3 Î¼M CHIR99021, 10 ng/ml human
FGF10, 10 ng/ml human FGF7) for day 14-16. Day 16â€“25 cultures of late stage lung progenitor
cells were maintained in SFD media containing 3 Î¼M CHIR99021, 10 ng/ml human FGF10, 10
ng/ml human FGF7, in a 5% CO2/air environment. For differentiation of mature lung cells (day 25
to 55), cultures were re-plated after brief trypsinization onto 3.3% Matrigel-coated 24-well plates
in SFD media containing maturation components containing 3 Î¼M CHIR99021, 10 ng/ml human
FGF-10; 10 ng/ml human FGF7, and DCI (50 nM Dexamethasone, 0.1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP
(Sigma Aldrich ) and 0.1 mM IBMX (3,7-dihydro-1-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-1H-purine-2,6dione) (Sigma Aldrich)). 1 ÂµM DAPT was added to the maturation media for induction of
pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and Tuft cells. The protocol details are summarized in
Figure S1A.

. HEK293T cells were grown to 80% confluency before transfection with

pCMV3-SARS-CoV2-spike (kindly provided by Dr. Peihui Wang, Shandong University, China)
using FuGENE 6 (Promega). Cells were cultured overnight at 37Â°C with 5% CO2. The next day,
the media was removed and VSV-G pseudotyped Î”G-luciferase (G*Î”G-luciferase, Kerafast) was
used to infect the cells in DMEM at an MOI of 3 for 1 hr before washing the cells with 1X DPBS
three times. DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 100 I.U. /mL penicillin and 100 Î¼g/mL
streptomycin was added to the infected cells and they were cultured overnight as described above.
The next day, the supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 300xg for 10 min
before aliquoting and storing at âˆ’80Â°C.

SARS-CoV-2 Viruses.
SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was deposited by the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. SARS-CoV-2 was
propagated in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM Lglutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES as
described previously23.

All work involving live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility
of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai in accordance with institutional biosafety requirements

SARS-CoV-2 entry virus infections.
For lung organoids, organoids were seeded in 24-well plates, pseudo-typed virus was added for
MOI=0.01 and centrifuged the plate at 1200g, 1 hour. At 24 hpi, organoids were fixed for
immunohistochemistry or harvested for luciferase assay following the Luciferase Assay System
protocol (E1501, Promega)

SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.
hESC-derived lung organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the indicated MOI and
incubated for 24 h at 37Â°C. Where indicated, hESC-derived lung organoids were pretreated with
DMSO, 10 ÂµM imatinib, 3 ÂµM MPA or 4.5 ÂµM QNHC for 3 h prior to infection as well as during
the course of infection. Where indicated, hESC-derived lung organoids were treated with DMSO,
10 ÂµM imatinib, 3 ÂµM MPA or 4.5 ÂµM QNHC 3 hpi. At the time point of harvest, cells were
washed three times with PBS and harvested for either RNA analysis or immunofluorescence
staining.

Approximately 2.5 Ã— 105 Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with DMSO, 10 ÂµM imatinib, 3 ÂµM MPA

Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. At 24 hpi, cells were washed three times with
PBS before harvesting for RNA or protein analysis.
Cells were either lysed in TRIzol for RNA analysis or in RIPA buffer for protein analysis or fixed
in 5% formaldehyde for 24 h for immunofluorescent staining, prior to safe removal from the BSL3 facility.

Xenograft formation.
1 million hESC-derived cells at lung progenitor stage (at day 25) were subcutaneously injected
into 6-8 weeks old NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1WjI/SzJ (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar
Harbor, Maine). When xenograft size becomes 1-2 CM3, they were sacrificed immediately,
necropsy performed, and cells were harvested for further histological or molecular study.

Immunohistochemistry.
Histology on tissues from mice was performed on paraffin-embedded or frozen sections from
xenografts and corresponding normal tissues as previously described27. Tissues were fixed
overnight in 10% buffered formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol, followed by paraffin
embedding, or tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and transferred to 30% sucrose,
followed by snap frozen in O.C.T (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Adjacent sections stained
with Hematoxylin and Eosin were used for comparison. Living cells in culture were directly fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, followed with 15 min permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100.
For immunofluorescence, cells or tissue sections were immunostained with primary antibodies at

4Â°C overnight and secondary antibodies at RT for 1h. The information for primary antibodies and
secondary antibodies are provided in Table S3. Nuclei were counterstained by DAPI.

Western blot.
Protein was extracted from cells in Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer
containing 1X Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and 1X Phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (Sigma Aldrich) prior to safe removal from the BSL-3 facility. Samples were analysed by
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected using rabbit
polyclonal anti-GAPDH (Sigma Aldrich, G9545), mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2
Nucleocapsid [1C7] and mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike [2B3E5] protein (a kind gift
by Dr. T. Moran, Center for Therapeutic Antibody Discovery at the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai). Primary antibodies were detected using Fluorophore-conjugated secondary goat
anti-mouse (IRDye 680RD, 926-68070) and goat anti-rabbit (IRDye 800CW, 926-32211)
antibodies. Antibody-mediated fluorescence was detected on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx imaging
system and analyzed using Image Studio software (LI-COR).

qRT-PCR.
Total RNA samples were prepared from cells/organoids using TRIzol and Direct-zol RNA
Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. To quantify viral
replication, measured by the expression of sgRNA transcription of the viral N gene, one-step
quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step
qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen) with primers specific for the TRS-L and TRS-B sites for the N gene as

well as ACTB as an internal reference. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on
a LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche). Delta-delta-cycle threshold (Î”Î”CT) was determined
relative to the ACTB and mock infected /treated samples. Error bars indicate the standard deviation
of the mean from three biological replicates. The sequences of primers/probes are provided in
Table S4.

Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.
We filtered cells with less than 200 or more than 6000 genes detected as well as cells with
mitochondria gene content greater than 30%, and used the remaining 14263 cells for downstream
analysis. We normalized the gene expression UMI counts using a deconvolution strategy
implemented by the R scran package (v.1.14.1). In particular, we pre-clustered cells using the
quickCluster function; we computed size factor per cell within each cluster and rescaled the size
factors by normalization between clusters using the computeSumFactors function; and we
normalized the UMI counts per cell by the size factors and took a logarithm transform using the
normalize function. We identified highly variable genes using the FindVariableFeatures function
in the R Seurat (v3.1.0) 28, and selected the top 3000 variable genes after excluding mitochondria
genes, ribosomal genes and dissociation-related genes. The list of dissociation-related genes was
originally built on mouse data

29

; we converted them to human ortholog genes using Ensembl

BioMart. We scaled the normalized counts and performed PCA on the highly variable genes using
the ScaleData and RunPCA functions in the R Seurat package 28. We selected the top 20 PCs for
downstream visualization and clustering analysis. We ran UMAP dimensional reduction using the
RunUMAP function in the R Seurat package with the number of neighboring points setting to 35
and training epochs setting to 500. We clustered cells into fifteen clusters by constructing a shared

nearest neighbor graph and then grouping cells of similar transcriptome profiles using the
FindNeighbors function and FindClusters function (resolution set to 0.2) in the R Seurat package.
We identified marker genes for each cluster by performing differential expression analysis
between cells inside and outside that cluster using the FindMarkers function in the R Seurat
package. After reviewing the clusters, we merged them into nine clusters representing nine cell
types (AT1 cells, AT2 cells, bronchiolar epithelial cells, stromal cells_1, stromal cell_2,
proliferating cells, stromal cells_3, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNEC) and airway epithelial
cells) for further analysis. We re-identified marker genes for the merged nine clusters and selected
top positive marker genes per cluster for heatmap plot using the DoHeatmap function in the R
Seurat package. The rest plots were generated using the R ggplot2 package.

RNA-Seq before and following viral infections.
Organoid infections were performed at an MOI of 0.1 and harvested at 24 hpi in DMEM
supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine and 1 Î¼g/ml TPCKtrypsin.
Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and DNase I treated using Directzol RNA
Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. RNAseq libraries of
polyadenylated RNA were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) or
TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. The resulting single end
reads were checked for quality (FastQC v0.11.5) and processed using the processed using the nfcore RNA-seq (v.1.4.2) workflow. Samples had adapters trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.4) then
ribosomal reads removed using SortMeRNA (v.2.1)before being aligned to human reference

genome (GRCh38) using STAR aligner30 (v.2.6.1). Raw gene counts were quantified using
Subread (v.1.6.4) featureCounts.

After further filtering and quality control, R package edgeR31 was used to calculate RPKM and
Log2 counts per million (CPM) matrices as well as perform differential expression analysis.
Principal component analysis was performed using Log2 CPM values and gene set analysis was
run with WebGestalt 32. Heatmaps and bar plots were generated using Graphpad Prism software,
version 7.0d.

High Throughput Chemical Screening.
hPSC-derived lung organoids were dissociated using TrypLE for 10 min in a 37â„ƒ waterbath and
replated into 10% Matrigel-coated 384-well plates at 10,000 cells/40 Âµl medium/well. Six hour
after plates, compounds from an in-house FDA-approved drug library (Prestwick) were added at
10 ÂµM. DMSO treatment was used as a negative control. Two hours late, cells will be infected
with SARS-CoV-2 pseudo virus (MOI=0.01). After 24 hpi, hPSC-COs were harvested for
luciferase assay following the Luciferase Assay System protocol (Promega).

QUANTIFICATION AND STATSTICAL ANALYSIS
N=3 independent biological replicates were used for all experiments unless otherwise indicated.
n.s. indicates a non-significant difference. P-values were calculated by unpaired two-tailed
Studentâ€™s t-test unless otherwise indicated. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001.
