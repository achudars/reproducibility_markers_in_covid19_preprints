Abstract
Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting SARS-CoV-2
associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, as well as how boosting alters
immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply
profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable
recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels,
administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M™. While antigen
dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall
titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints.
Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with
distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined,
but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective
immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving
maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose
may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2
and emerging variants.

Key words: NVX-CoV2373 vaccine, Matrix-M™ adjuvant, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein,

Introduction

61

SARS-CoV-2 causes a spectrum of respiratory disease from asymptomatic to mild and severe

62

coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Since it crossed into humans, the virus has spread globally

63

with over 90 million confirmed cases and over 2 million deaths1. COVID-19 manifests with a

64

range of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to severe disease, with 50-75% of infected

65

individuals exhibiting asymptomatic infection and only a small proportion (2-5%) developing

66

severe disease, requiring mechanical ventilation2-4. The vaccines authorized for emergency use,

67

mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, have been successful in preventing severe infections and inducing

68

anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and potent neutralizing antibody responses5-7.

69

However, whether these vaccines confer protection against transmission as well as disease

70

remains unclear.

71
72

Emerging Phase 3 data suggest that vaccine-mediated protection emerges as early as 10 days

73

following primary vaccination8,9, at a time when neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable5-

74

7

75

vector SARS-CoV-2 vaccination point to a potential additional role for added antibody effector

76

functions, in collaboration with neutralization, as key correlates of immunity against SARS-

77

CoV-210,11. However, whether these responses evolve following the prime or the boost, provide

78

differential protection across the upper and lower respiratory tract, and provide protection against

79

variants remains unclear.

. Similarly, emerging correlates of immunity following administration of DNA- and adenoviral-

81

In this study, we deeply interrogated humoral correlates of protection in a cohort of rhesus

82

macaques immunized with one or two doses 5 or 25 µg of a stabilized recombinant full-length

83

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) with 50 µg Matrix-M adjuvant. Animals

84

immunized with the two-dose regimen, regardless if given the high (25μg) or low (5μg) antigen

85

dose, were protected against upper and lower respiratory infection (URTI and LRTI) and

86

shedding of replicating virus, while a single vaccine injection (regardless of antigen dose) was

87

only partially protective against infection. Distinct combinations of Fc-features and neutralizing

88

antibody responses were associated with protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract,

89

pointing to potential mechanistic differences required to control the virus at these distinct

90

immunological locations. Critically, the NVX-CoV2373 generated binding and functional

Results

97

Subgenomic virus mRNA in respiratory samples

98

Emerging Phase 3 data from mRNA vaccine platforms suggest that vaccine-induced protection

99

against disease is observable as early as 10 days following vaccine priming, prior to the presence

100

of robust neutralizing antibody levels8,9. However, whether these responses are associated with

101

complete sterilizing immunity remains unclear. To define the specific humoral profiles that track

102

with protective immunity against disease and infection, we profiled the humoral immune

103

response induced by a stabilized, full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) vaccine (NVX-CoV2373)

104

following a prime-only or prime/boost vaccine regimen administered at 2 different antigen doses

105

(5 and 25μg) with Matrix-M adjuvant (50μg). Groups of rhesus macaques (n=5) were immunized

106

with one vaccine dose (study day 0) or two vaccine doses, spaced 3 weeks apart (study day 0 and

107

21). Control animals (n=4) received one or two injections of formulation buffer (placebo). Serum

108

was collected prior to immunization (day 0) and 21 and 31/32 days after the first dose (Fig 1A).

109
110

Protection was assessed by analyzing viral loads across the upper (nasal washes and nasal

111

pharyngeal swabs) and lower (bronchoalveolar lavage; BAL) respiratory tract on days 2-8 post-

112

infection (dpi). The highest levels of viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) were observed in placebo

113

animals across the upper and lower-respiratory tract samples, with peak viral loads observed 2dpi

114

and persistent sgRNA until day 7/8 (Fig 1B, C, D). Animals immunized with a single dose of

115

5μg or 25μg NVX-CoV2373 had lower levels of replicating virus at day 2 in all tissues

116

compared to placebo, however the 25μg dose was able to clear sgRNA in BAL and nasal

117

pharyngeal swabs at day 7/8, while the 5μg only cleared BAL. The animals that received 5μg or

118

25μg antigen in a prime/boost regimen had no detectable viral loads in BAL or nasal pharyngeal

119

swabs at any day and all sgRNA was cleared in nasal washes by day 4. In addition, tissue

120

samples were collected from the upper, middle, and lower right lung lobes; trachea; and nasal

121

cavity at the scheduled necropsy (7-8 dpi) and analyzed for viral gRNA. There was no gRNA in

122

nasal cavity, trachea, or lungs of animals immunized with 5μg or 25μg antigen in a prime/boost

123

regimen (Fig 1E, F, G). Conversely, nearly all placebo animals exhibited gRNA in each tissue

124

(Fig 1E, F, G). Animals immunized with a single vaccine dose were partially protected, with a

125

minority of animals having detectable gRNA. These data suggest that one vaccine dose was able

126

to induce a partially protective immune response, differing by antigen dose level, but two

vaccine doses resulted in full protection against infection along the respiratory tract, independent

128

of antigen dose.

130

Antibody responses after NVX-CoV2373 immunization

131

To determine if the humoral immune response could distinguish protected from non-protected

132

animals, we analyzed the IgG titers and neutralizing antibody response across the vaccine

133

groups. Robust anti-S IgG titers were observed across both vaccine groups after a single

134

immunization. Anti-S IgG titers remained stable at 31/32 days after 1 dose, however anti-S IgG

135

titers significantly increased 21-35-fold within 10 days following the booster immunization with

136

5μg or 25μg of NVX-CoV2373 (Fig 2A). Low levels of mucosal anti-S IgG antibodies were

137

detected in the nasal washes and BAL aspirates collected 31/32 days after one immunization,

138

increasing 8-22-fold in nasal washes and BAL aspirates at 10 days following the booster

139

immunization (Fig 2B, 2C).

140
141

To further profile the functional potential of the vaccine induced antibodies, a spike-pseudotype

142

virus neutralization assay was used to assess the neutralizing capacity in serum of immunized

143

animals. Serum from animals immunized with 5μg or 25μg NVX-CoV2373 had similar

144

pseudovirus neutralizing titers (ID50) after a single dose. Following the booster immunization,

145

pseudovirus neutralizing titers significantly increased, with no significant differences noted

146

between the antigen doses (Fig 2D). In addition, live wild type virus neutralization assays and

147

hACE2 inhibition exhibited similar trends, with detectable neutralization/inhibition at day 21 in

148

all regimens, with a significant increase after the second vaccine dose (Fig 2E and 2F). Overall,

149

these results indicate that NVX-CoV2373 administered as a prime/boost regimen elicited high

150

anti-S IgG titers, capable of blocking binding to the hACE2 receptor and neutralizing in vitro

151

infectivity of spike-pseudotyped virus and wild type SARS-CoV-2. All non-human primates

152

(NHPs) treated with one dose had similar neutralization titers, but only some were protected

153

from viral infection, suggesting that neutralization may not be sufficient to fully explain

154

complete protection from infection, particularly following a single vaccine dose.

Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is marked by a rapid rise of multiple antibody isotypes and

158

subclasses, each positioned to recruit a diverse set of antibody effector functions12,13. Recent

159

studies have noted a significant correlation between antibody-effector function, rather than

160

neutralization, with natural resolution of infection in humans14. Thus, we next examined the

161

evolution of subclass, isotype, Fc-receptor, and Fc-effector function across doses and boosting

162

strategies (Supplementary Fig 1).

163
164

As expected, based on titers (Fig 2), luminex IgG1 levels were robustly induced following a

165

single vaccine dose, indistinguishably across antigen levels, with a 1.5-4-fold increase following

166

a boost (Fig 3A). Similarly, IgA were induced robustly to a maximal level after one 25μg dose,

167

but required boosting to reach maximal levels in the 5μg vaccine group (Fig 3A). Conversely, a

168

trend towards higher levels of IgM were noted in 5μg vaccine group following a single vaccine

169

dose, that declined with a boost and were largely lost in the 25μg dose group (Fig 3A), pointing

170

to enhanced class switching to more mature antibody subclasses with boosting and higher

171

antigen doses. These data point to the first differences across antigen-dosing group, highlighting

172

equivalent IgG and IgA selection across groups, but more aggressive switching of IgM, shifting

173

the polyclonal balance of the vaccine-specific antibody pool towards a more mature Fc-

174

functional profile.

175
176

Changes in polyclonal antibody profiles result in the potential formation of distinct swarms of

177

antibodies able to engage with a target pathogen, forming qualitatively distinct immune

178

complexes, that collectively shape the Fc-receptors (FcRs) bound on innate immune cells,

179

thereby driving distinct antibody effector functions15-18. Thus, to explore differences in

180

functionality across doses and boosting regimens, we next profiled differences in binding

181

profiles across rhesus Fc-receptors. Equivalent FcγRIIA-1 binding was observed across the 2

182

antigen doses after the prime, although there was a trend to a loss of binding at day 31/32 in the

183

5μg dosing group (Fig 3B). However, after a boost, FcγRIIA-1 binding antibodies increased by

184

4-100-fold across the doses, with a trend towards higher binding antibodies in the 25μg dosing

185

group (Fig 3B). Nearly identical profiles were observed across the other rhesus FcRs, pointing to

186

a substantial quantitative advantage induced by the boost, that tended to differ across the doses.

188

Finally, to explore the functional impact of these changes in vaccine induced antibody Fc-

189

profiles, we examined the ability of the humoral response to stimulate antibody-dependent

190

functions: cellular monocyte phagocytosis (ADCP), neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP),

191

complement deposition (ADCD), and NK degranulation (NKdegran). Similar ADCP responses

192

were induced across the antigen doses following a single vaccination (Fig 3C). Conversely,

193

robust augmentation of ADCP was observed with a boost (Fig 3C), that surprisingly tended to be

194

higher in the 5μg group. An identical profile was observed for NK-cell activating antibodies.

195

Neutrophil phagocytosis was slightly higher in the 5μg group after the prime, and then fully

196

matured across both groups with a boost, remaining slightly elevated in the 5μg group.

197

Conversely, complement activating antibodies were induced equivalently across the antigen-

198

dosing groups following a single dose, and increased with a boost in an antigen dose-

199

independent manner. Thus, while titers and neutralization reached near maximal potential after a

200

single vaccine dose, these data point to a critical role for boosting in driving the full maturation

201

of the Fc-effector potential of the vaccine induced humoral response, that are further subtly tuned

202

by antigen dosing.

203
204

Unique humoral profiles of vaccine regimen

205

Given the various univariate profile differences noted across the vaccine groups, we next aimed

206

to define whether distinct multivariate profiles were induced across the regimens. Aggregate data

207

clearly highlighted the striking influence of the boost and the more nuanced effects of antigen

208

dose on shaping the polyclonal vaccine response (Fig 4A). Antigen-dose effects emerged upon

209

unsupervised analysis using a principal component analysis (PCA), pointing to a tendency

210

towards separation between antigen dose and vaccine-specific antibody profiles in the animals

211

that received a single dose (Fig 4B), that was largely lost with the boost (Fig 4C). However,

212

integration of the 4 groups clearly demonstrated the dominant influence of the boost in shaping

213

antibody profiles(Fig 4D). Specifically, robust separation in antibody profiles across single and

214

double immunized animal vaccine-specific antibody profiles (Fig 4D), with a more subtle effect

215

of dose on shaping vaccine-specific antibody profiles, solely observed in the single dose arms.

216

Finally, radar plots of the humoral immune response across vaccine arms demonstrated the clear

217

explosion of humoral immune maturation with the second dose, albeit slight differences in

218

antibody effector functions were noted across the doses. Additionally, more nuanced differences

were observed in the single dose arms, with a more balanced functional response observed in the

220

25μg group compared to the 5μg immunized animals at day 31-32, prior to challenge (Fig 4E).

221

These data provide a deep immunologic view of the vaccine-induced polyclonal functional

222

profiles induced following vaccination, and how they are shaped by dose and boosting prior to

223

challenge.

224
225

Immune correlates of protection from viral infection

226

While neutralizing antibodies have been clearly linked to vaccine-mediated protection following

227

DNA11, AD26

10

, protein19, and mRNA based vaccination

5-7

, protection has been noted in

8,9

228

humans prior to the evolution of neutralizing antibodies . Similarly, despite robust induction of

229

neutralizing antibodies given one or two doses of NVX-CoV2373, variable levels of protection

230

were observed against upper and lower respiratory viral loads across the groups (Fig

231

1B,C,D,E,F,G). To define the humoral correlates of immunity of viral control across the

232

respiratory tract, all antibody metrics were integrated, and an unsupervised multivariate analysis

233

was performed to objectively define antibody correlates of immunity. Clear separation was noted

234

in vaccine-induced antibody profiles across NHPs exhibiting complete protection against SARS-

235

CoV-2 compared to animals that exhibited viral loads in one or several compartments (Fig 5A).

236

Specifically, the PCA illustrated a substantial split in antibody profiles in animals that exhibited

237

no protection/protection in the lower respiratory tract (BAL) from animals that exhibited more

238

complete protection across the upper and lower-respiratory tract (nasal washes, nasal swabs, and

239

BAL). Thus, unsupervised analysis suggested the presence of unique humoral immune correlates

240

of immunity in lower and upper respiratory tracts.

241
242

To gain deeper resolution into the specific features of the humoral immune response that may

243

lead to these distinct levels of viral restriction across compartments, the relationship of individual

244

features and protection was assessed by calculating the area-under-the-curve for each receiver

245

operator characteristic (ROC) curve within each compartment (Fig 5B). The top features

246

associated with protection in the lower respiratory tract (BAL) included antibody titers, S2- and

247

S1-specific FcR binding, and hACE2 receptor inhibition. Similarly, the top features associated

248

with protection in the BAL and nasal pharyngeal swab included the levels of S1-specific

249

antibody titers of several IgG subclasses and hACE2 inhibition. However, complete protection

250

from viral replication across the upper and lower respiratory tracts was associated with a robust

251

whole S-specific multi-subclass specific response, complement-depositing functions, and

252

neutralizing antibody titers. The radar plots further illustrated the magnitude and multivariate

253

nature of the protective humoral immune response, marked by poor antibody responses in

254

unprotected animals, an expansion of subclasses, but not functions, in animals with solely lower

255

respiratory tract protection (BAL), an expanded functional and FcR-binding antibody profiles in

256

animals with BAL and nasal swab protection. Conversely, the largest, functionally expanded

257

humoral immune response was observed in animals with complete protection across the upper

258

and lower respiratory tract (Fig 5C). These data point to an intimate collaboration between the

259

Fc and Fab in driving full viral protection, where neutralization may be key to lower-respiratory

260

protection, but the potential need for additional Fc-effector functions in collaboration with

261

neutralization may be key for full protection across the respiratory tract.

262
263

Antibody response to emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants

264

Despite the promising results observed in Phase 3 trials with the mRNA vaccines, significant

265

concern has recently arisen globally, due to the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants across

266

the globe20-23. Among the variants, the recently identified genetic variant, B.1.1.7 (Public Health

267

England Variant of Concern) and B.1.351/501Y.V2 (South African Variant of Concern) include

268

multiple mutations in the Spike protein that appear to improve viral infectivity24-26 or escape

269

neutralizing antibodies27,28. While early data suggested limited impact of the 501Y mutation on

270

neutralizing antibody responses 29-31, recent data suggest that this mutation may reduce mRNA

271

vaccine induced neutralization27, matching recent Novavax vaccine efficacy results in the

272

UK32,33. Conversely, consistently reduced neutralization has been noted against the emerging

273

viral variant from South Africa, in parallel to reduced vaccine efficacy in RSA27,32. Yet, how

274

these mutations affect overall vaccine-induced immunity remains unclear. Thus, we profiled the

275

functional antibody response to the UK (B.1.1.7 RBD and N501Y∆69-70 Spike) and RSA

276

(B.1.351 RBD, E484K RBD and E484K Spike) variants compared to the D614G viral variant for

277

spike and WT variant for RBD. Strong correlations were observed between the dominant D614G

278

variant and the two emerging variant viruses, across all antibody metrics (Fig 6A). However,

279

some diminution of antibody binding (IgG1/IgG3) and Fc-receptor binding was noted across

280

both strains, albeit the effect was most pronounced for the RSA strains in both the macaques (Fig

6A) and humans (Fig 6B). Interestingly, macaques (Fig 6A) displayed a more pronounced loss

282

of humoral reactivity to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants compared to humans (Fig 6B), where

283

humans with high antibody titers largely retained FcR-binding to the mutants. Conversely,

284

human vaccinees with intermediate antibody titers exhibited a more profound loss of S-specific

285

FcR binding, potentially contributing to the observed vulnerability in a fraction of vaccinees to

286

infection/disease. Multivariate analyses by PCA, where variation in antibody profiles across

287

SARS-CoV-2 variants were captured (Fig 6C), point to altered binding, specifically in the

288

macaque humoral immune response across the E484K and B.1.351 RBD variants compared to

289

the UK variant. These data highligh the dominant effect of E484K in knocking out Fc-effector

290

function against the RBD, in addition to a loss of neutralization27-29,34 (Supplementary Fig 2A-

291

C).

292
293

These data point to a slight reduction in antibody effector function against the B.1.1.7

294

variants, but a diminished overall response to the E484K and B.1.351 variant that may explain

295

differences in the level of efficacy observed in the recent clinical trials32. The presence of more

296

robust recognition of the full Spike variants among individuals with robust humoral immune

297

responses, representing approximately half of the vaccinees, suggests that at high antibody titers,

298

vaccine induced immunity may contribute to protection against variants, via non-RBD specific

299

responses, the latter that are lost with the E484K mutation. Thus, these data suggest that NVX-

300

CoV2373 stimulates a robust humoral immune response that is fully functionally matured with

301

boosting. While antigen dose has a more limited influence on shaping the functional protective

302

profile of the humoral immune response, the induction of both neutralization and Fc-receptor

303

mediated activity represents key correlates of immunity against upper and lower respiratory tract

304

protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, that may be key to both protection from disease

305

and transmission.

306
307

Discussion

308

Vaccine shortages, the need for rapid global deployment, increasing reinfection cases, and the

309

emergence of viral variants have collectively pointed to the urgent need to define correlates of

310

immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Using a unique vaccine study, poised to profile

311

both the importance of antigen-dose and boosting, here we deeply and comprehensively

312

dissected the key correlates of immunity against upper and lower respiratory tract infection.

313

Despite the induction of robust vaccine-specific antibody titers and neutralization with a single

314

dose or two doses of 5μg or 25μg NVX-CoV2373, differential levels of viral restriction were

315

observed across animals in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Specifically, animals receiving

316

a single dose vaccine were only partially protected against replicating virus in the upper

317

respiratory tract, whereas animals receiving 2 doses exhibited near complete protection. These

318

data suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block

319

further transmission.

320
321

The improved protection of the two-dose vaccine was linked to a dramatic maturation of the Fc-

322

effector profiles of vaccine induced antibodies, that collaborated with neutralization as key

323

correlates of immunity against viral replication, with highly functional and neutralizing antibody

324

responses conferring the most robust restriction across the upper and lower respiratory tract.

325

Thus overall, these data demonstrate the critical importance of a coordinated Fab- and Fc-

326

mediated antibody response for full protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, that may also

327

function against emerging variants.

328
329

Both human vaccines, mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, require a prime and boost to achieve

330

optimal protection. However, as the logistical challenges become apparent in distributing a

331

vaccine globally, interest in increasing the available vaccine by reducing the amount of vaccine

332

or doses given per individual has increased. Preliminary retrospective analysis of the first dose of

333

the Pfizer/BNT162b2 before boosting suggested approximately a 52% protection from severe

334

infection 5,35. However, whether a single dose can provide long-term protection remains unclear.

335

While immunogenicity and durability vary significantly across vaccine platforms5-7,10,11,19, our

336

data demonstrate some level of protection against lower-respiratory infection after a single

337

vaccine. Yet single dose vaccine-maintained IgM, exhibited incomplete class switching, poor

338

mucosal antibody levels, and demonstrated incomplete functional effector and neutralizing

339

responses, albeit a more balanced response was noted at the higher (25μg) antigen dose.

340

However, after two doses, the explosion of antibody effector function and neutralization likely

341

resulted in a significant increase in protection against both upper and lower respiratory viral

342

replication, linked to the combined presence of potent neutralizing and Fc-effector inducing

343

antibodies and continue to point to the value of the booster immunization.

344
345

Neutralizing antibodies represent a critical obstacle to viral infection at the time of infection.

346

However, the density of antibody-producing cells likely varies along the respiratory tract, with a

347

higher density of immune cells found in the lower respiratory tract compared to the more

348

immune barren upper respiratory tract36,37. Thus, to achieve complete sterilizing protection from

349

infection in the upper respiratory tract, it is plausible that additional immune mechanisms may be

350

required in the upper respiratory tract to compensate for potentially lower antibody levels. Here

351

we observed the key role of neutralizing antibodies deep within the lungs, but the critical

352

importance of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of multiple subclasses, binding to multiple Fc-receptors,

353

and complement activation as key additional functional mechanisms that may contribute to upper

354

respiratory protection. Given that the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine induced potent neutralizing

355

antibodies across doses and regimens, we were unable to divorce the influence of neutralization

356

and Fc-effector function. Similar profiles have been noted following reinfection, DNA and

357

Ad26-vaccine studies, marking the co-evolution of the Fab and Fc, and the importance of both

358

ends of the molecule in protective immunity10,11. However, whether neutralization and/or Fc-

359

effector function persist differentially over time following vaccination, conferring different

360

levels of protection may provide key insights on precise durable correlates of immunity.

361
362

As the virus has begun to adapt to populations across the globe, a number of SARS-CoV-2

363

variants have begun to emerge. The D641G mutation spread rapidly from Europe to other

364

continents, resulting in a conformational change in the rigidity of the RBD, resulting in enhanced

365

infectivity in vitro, but resulting in no escape from neutralizing antibodies

366

recently the B.1.1.7 mutation has spread across and out of the UK since September 202021,

367

representing 3 key mutations N501Y, P681H, and ∆69-70, that have been linked to enhanced

368

ACE2-binding, but limited impact on neutralizing antibody activity by monoclonal or the

369

Pfizer/BNT162b220,26,28,30,31,44. Additional variants have begun to emerge in South Africa

370

(B.1.351/501Y.V2) and Brazil (P.1), including mutations both in the RBD and the N-terminal

domain

variants in both macaques and humans, with a more profound loss of binding to RSA variant

374

mutations, particularly related to a nearly complete loss of RSA RBD-specific humoral

375

immunity. However, full Spike-specific antibody binding persisted in approximately half of the

376

human vaccinees, particularly in those with robust antibody titers, pointing to the potential for

377

persisting Fc-effector functions as a key compensatory correlate of immunity in the face of

378

evolving mutants that knock out RBD-binding and neutralization. These data mirror the observed

379

rates of protection observed in the recent Phase2 vaccines studies32, further substantiating the

380

potential critical importance of both Fab and Fc-functionality in overall population level vaccine

381

efficacy. Yet, further research is needed promptly to identify the impact of emerging mutations

382

on both neutralization and other antibody effector functions that may contribute to antiviral

383

control and protection.

384
385

After just 4 months, the WHO declared that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had caused a worldwide

386

pandemic. In response, several vaccines have progressed through late stages of clinical

387

evaluation. To date, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, recently

388

received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Although these vaccines have an acceptable

389

safety profile and effectively protect against more severe disease, they require freezing, have

390

limited data on long-term durability, and have not been shown to protect against infection or

391

transmission. Moreover, given the limited number of vaccine doses available, more vaccine

392

candidates are urgently needed that are able to counteract both wildtype and emerging variant

393

strains. Thus, the need to understand correlates of immunity has never been more urgent, to

394

support the selection and design of additional vaccines able to confer global protective immunity.

395

Here, we describe the identification of correlates of immunity using a subunit vaccine that is

396

stable at refrigerated temperatures, and is immunogenic and well tolerated in human studies19. In

397

this study, we demonstrate the presence of binding and neutralizing antibody titers after a single

398

immunization, using either 5μg or 25μg of vaccine, but a remarkable maturation of the Fc-

399

effector profile after a second immunization. Moreover, while partial protection was observed

400

with neutralizing antibodies alone after a single round of immunization, complete protection in

401

the upper and lower respiratory tract was observed with a second round of immunization,

402

marking critical Fab and Fc-mediated correlates of immunity that may be key to both protection

403

against disease and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants. Thus this work bolsters

against infection and transmission, but also to drive durability. Collectively, these data provide

key insights into compartment specific immune correlates that may be critical for protection

511

with 1.0 µg mL-1 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (BV2373, Lot# 16Apr20, Novavax, Inc.

560

Vero E6 media was used as a negative control. Each serum dilution was assessed

561

microscopically for inhibition of virus cytopathic effect (CPE) on Vero E6 cells. The endpoint

562

titer was reported as the reciprocal of the dilution at which 99% CPE was observed at 3 days post

Preparation of the SARS-CoV-2 challenge stock

566

A fourth cell-culture passage (P4) of SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was obtained from

567

Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (catalog number NR-

568

52281, BEI Resources, GenBank accession number MN985325.1). Live virus stock was

569

prepared in the Texas Biomed ABSL-3 containment facility. The stock virus was passaged for a

570

fifth time (P5) in Vero E6 cells at a MOI of 0.001 to produce the master virus stock. The master

571

stock was again passaged in Vero E6 cells at a MOI of 0.02 (P6) to produce the challenge stock.

572

The P6 challenge stock had a titer of 2.10 × 106 pfu mL-1 (Lot No. 20200320) and was stored 500

573

μL aliquots at -65ºC in Dulbecco’s modified essential media (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine

574

serum. The identity of the challenge stock was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 by deep

575

sequencing and was confirmed to be identical to the published sequence (GenBank: MN985325).

576
577

SARS-CoV-2 challenge

578

Vaccinated and placebo animals were transferred from the ABSL-2 facility on study day 31/32 to

579

the ABSL-3 facility and acclimated for 7 days. On the day of challenge (study day 38), animals

580

were sedated and challenged with a total target dose of 1.05 × 106 pfu in 500 μL. The challenge

581

dose was equally administered by the intranasal (IN) route 5.25 × 105 pfu in 250 μL and intra-

582

tracheal (IT) route 5.25 × 105 pfu in 250 μL. IN administration was performed with an

583

atomization device (Teleflex Intranasal Mucosal Atomization Device LMA MAD Nasal Device,

584

Morrisville, NC, USA) and IT delivery was performed with Tracheal Mucosal Atomization

585

Device (Teleflex Laryngo-Tracheal Mucosal Atomization Device LMA MADGIC, Morrisville,

586

NC, USA). To confirm the challenge dose, aliquots of the challenge samples were collected prior

587

to challenging the first animal and last animal and stored at ≤ -65ºC. A neutral red agarose

588

overlay and conventional plaque assay were used to confirm the titer of the challenge dose. The

589

actual pre- and post-challenge titers were 1.80 × 106 pfu mL-1 and 7.83 × 105 pfu, respectively.

632

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was assessed with spike-pseudotyped virus infection of HEK

633

293T/ACE2 cells as a function of reduction in luciferase (Luc) reporter activity. HEK

634

293T/ACE2 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mM

635

HEPES, 50 µg mL-1 gentamycin and 3 µg mL-1 puromycin. An expression plasmid encoding

636

codon-optimized full-length spike of the Wuhan-1 strain (VRC7480), was provided by Drs.

637

Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett at the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of

638

Health (USA). The D614G amino acid change was introduced into VRC7480 by site-directed

639

mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (catalog number

640

210518, Agilent Technologies). The mutation was confirmed by full-length spike gene

641

sequencing. Pseudovirions were produced in HEK 293T/17 cells (ATCC cat. no. CRL-11268,

642

Manassas, VA, USA) by transfection using Fugene 6 (catalog number E2692, Promega,

643

aliquots at -80ºC. TCID50 assays were performed on thawed aliquots to determine the infectious

650

dose for neutralization assays (RLU 500-1000x background, background 50-100 RLU).

651
652

For neutralization, a pre-titrated dose of virus was incubated with 8 serial 5-fold dilutions of

653

serum samples in duplicate in a total volume of 150 µL for 1 h at 37ºC in 96-well flat-bottom

654

poly-L-lysine-coated Biocoat plates (catalog number 354461, Corning, NY, USA). Cells were

655

suspended using TrypLE Select Enzyme solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and immediately

656

added to all wells (10,000 cells in 100 µL of growth medium per well). One set of 8 control wells

657

received cells + virus (virus control) and another set of 8 wells received cells only (background

658

control). After 66-72 h of incubation, medium was removed by gentle aspiration and 30 µL of

659

Promega 1X lysis buffer was added to all wells. After a 10 minute incubation at room

660

temperature, 100 µL of Bright-Glo luciferase reagent was added to all wells. After 1-2 minutes,

661

110 µL of the cell lysate was transferred to a black/white plate (Perkin-Elmer). Luminescence

662

was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Model Victor2 luminometer. Neutralization

663

titers are the serum dilution at which relative luminescence units (RLU) were reduced by either

664

50% (ID50) compared to virus control wells after subtraction of background RLUs. Serum

665

samples were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56ºC prior to assay.

667

Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and neutrophil phagocytosis

668

ADCP and ADNP were conducted as previously described56,57. Briefly, NVX-CoV2373 Spike

669

protein was biotinylated using EDC (Thermo Fisher) and Sulfo-NHS (Thermo Fisher), and then

670

coupled to yellow/green Neutravidin-conjugated beads (Thermo Fisher). Immune complexes

671

were formed by incubating the bead+protein conjugates with diluted serum for 2 hours at 37°C,

672

and then washed to remove unbound antibody. The immune complexes were then incubated

673

overnight with THP-1 cells (ADCP), or for 1 hour with RBC-lyzed whole blood (ADNP). THP-1

674

cells were then washed and fixed in 4% PFA, while the RBC-lyzed whole blood was washed,

675

stained for CD66b+ (Biolegend) to identify neutrophils, and then fixed in 4% PFA. Flow

676

cytometry was performed to identify the percentage of quantity of beads phagocytosed by THP-1

677

cells or neutrophils, and a phagocytosis score was calculated (% cells positive × Median

678

Fluorescent Intensity of positive cells). Flow cytometry was performed with an IQue (Intellicyt)

Isotyping and FcR profiling was conducted as previously described60,61. Briefly, antigens (NVX-

711

CoV2373 Spike, SARS-CoV-2 Spike, S1, RBD, S2, HKU-1 RBD, or OC43 RBD) were

712

carboxyl coupled to magnetic Luminex microplex carboxylated beads (Luminex Corporation)

713

using NHS-ester linkages with Sulfo-NHS and EDC (Thermo Fisher), and then incubated with

714

serum for 2 hours at 37°C. Isotyping was performed by incubating the immune complexes with

715

secondary mouse-anti-rhesus antibody detectors for each isotype (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA),

716

then detected with tertiary anti-mouse-IgG antibodies conjugated to PE. FcR binding was

717

quantified by incubating immune complexes with biotinylated FcRs (FcγR2A-1, FcγR2A-2,

718

FcγR3A, courtesy of Duke Protein Production Facility) conjugated to Steptavidin-PE (Prozyme).

IntelliCyt ForeCyt (v8.1).

721
722

Multivariate analysis

723

A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed based on serological features using the R

724

package ‘ropls’. The systems serology antibody titers, FcR binding and ADCD measurements

725

were log10-transformed, and all measurements were z-scored. The PCA analyses was performed

726

in R version 4.0.2.

727
728

Statistical analysis

729

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. Serum antibodies were

730

plotted for individual animals and the geometric mean titer (GMT) and 95% confidence intervals

731

plotted. Virus loads were plotted as the median value, interquartile range, and minimum and

732

maximum values. Student’s t-test or two-way ANOVA was used to determine differences

733

between paired groups as indicated in the figure legends. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.

734

The AUCs and bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated using the R package ‘pROC’. For

735

the case of AUC = 1 no confidence interval was provided. To visualize fold change of mutant

736

humoral features with respect to the WT, a volcano plot was constructed. To calculate p-values,

737

the R package ‘stats’ was used. The AUC and fold change analyses were performed in R version

738

4.0.2.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Subgenomic RNA and viral RNA in upper and lower respiratory tract of NVXCoV2373 immunized rhesus macaques
(A) Groups of adult rhesus macaques (n= 4-5/group) were immunized with a single priming dose
(study day 0) or a prime/boost regimen (study day 0 and 21) of 5 μg or 25 μg NVX-CoV2373
with 50 μg Matrix-M (0.5mL; IM). A separate group (n=4) received formulation buffer
(placebo). Immunized and placebo animals were transferred to an ABSL-3 containment facility
(study day 31/32) and acclimated for 7 days prior to challenge with a total of 1.05 × 106 pfu
SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) in 500 μL divided between the intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) routes. Animals were monitored daily for up to 7-8 days post infection (1-8 dpi).
Serum sample collection days are indicated by the red triangles. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
sample collection days are indicated by the blue triangles. Necropsy and tissue collection is
indicated by the black triangle. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the replicating
subgenomic (sg) envelope (E) RNA in nasal washes, nasal pharyngeal swabs, and BAL samples
collected for up to 7-8 dpi. (B) Nasal pharyngeal washes. (C) Nasal swabs. (D) BAL aspirates.
(E) SARS-CoV-2 gRNA in the Nasal cavity virus load. (F) Trachea virus load. (G) Upper,
middle and lower lobes of the lungs of immunized and placebo treated animals. In the bar-andwhisker plots, the median is indicated by a horizontal line, the top and bottom of the box
indicated the interquartile range, and the whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values.
Individual animal values are indicated by the colored symbols. Dashed horizontal line indicates
the limit of detection. Genomic equivalent copies (GE copies mL-1). Significant differences
between the placebo group and the immunized groups was determined by Student’s t-test (two
tailed, unpaired). Not significant (ns), *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001.
Figure 2. Immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 vaccine in rhesus macaques
(A) Serum anti-S IgG titer (B) Nasal wash and (C) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were
collected 31/32 days after the first immunization and prior to challenge and analyzed for spike
(S)-specific mucosal IgG (n= 4-5/group). (D) Pseudovirus neutralizing titer (ID50). (E) SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer (99% inhibition of cytopathic effect, 99% CPE) study day
31/32. (F) hACE2 receptor blocking antibody titer (study day 31/32). The geometric mean titers
(GMT) are indicated by the white bars. Hollow arrows indicate prime/boosting with NVXCoV2373. The error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Individual animal
values are indicated by colored symbols. A Student’s t-test (unpaired, two tail) was used to
compare antibody levels between groups immunized with one and two doses. **p ≤ 0.001, ***p
≤ 0.0001, ****p ≤ 0.00001. The horizontal dashed line indicates the limit of detection (LOD) for
each assay.
Figure 3. System serology profiling of NVX-CoV2373 immunized rhesus macaques
Serum was collected day 21 and day 31/32 after the first dose of NVX-CoV2373, and profiled
for the anti-NVX-CoV2373 antibody response. Luminex was used to quantify the (A) antibody
isotypes (IgG1, IgA, and IgM) and (B) FcR binding (FcγRIIA-1, FcγRIIA-2, FcγRIIIA) for the
anti-NVX-CoV2373 antibody response. (C) The functional anti-NVX-CoV2373-specific

Figure 4. Unique humoral profile of vaccine regimens
Multivariate analysis was performed to distinguish the humoral response between the various
vaccine regimens. (A) Heatmap of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike. Each Column is
one NHP and one time point. Each row was Z-scored across itself for the whole cohort. (B)
Principal component analysis (PCA) of antibody features at day 31/32 showing NHPs that
received one 5μg dose (light blue) or one 25μg dose (dark blue). Ellipses indicate 90%
confidence regions assuming a multivariate t distribution. (C) PCA of antibody features at day
31/32 showing NHPs that received two 5μg doses (light pink) or two 25μg doses (dark pink). (D)
PCA of antibody features at day 31/32 showing NHPs that received one 5μg dose (light pink),
one 25μg dose (dark pink), two 5μg doses (light blue), or two 25μg doses (dark blue). (E) The
radar plots show the median percentile for antibody titer, FcR binding, and antibody function
(legend on right) for NHPs treated with placebo, two 5μg doses, two 25μg doses, one 5μg dose,
or one 25μg dose in serum collected on day 21 (top row) and day 31/32 (bottom row).
Figure 5. Immune correlates of protection from viral replication
Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the features of a protective humoral response.
(A) Principal component analysis (PCA) for the immunized NHPs (n=20, no placebos included)
indicating protected (blue) NHPs with no detectable virus in BAL, BAL + nasal swab, BAL +
nasal swab + nasal wash vs non-protected (yellow) NHPs. Ellipses indicate 90% confidence
regions assuming a multivariate t distribution and are shown for protected and non-protected
NHPs. (B) Correlates of protection for BAL (n=20), nasal swab (n=20), or nasal wash (n=19) at
day 31/32. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) for the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve
is shown with 95% confidence intervals for each antibody feature. (C) The radar plots show the
median percentile for antibody titer, FcR binding, and antibody function (legend on right) for
non-protected, protected in BAL, protected in BAL+nasal swab, or protected in BAL+nasal
swab+nasal wash NHPs.
Figure 6. Antibody binding and functionality against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant spike
proteins
(A) NHP Serum (n=24) was collected day 31/32 after the first dose of NVX-CoV2373, and
profiled for the antibody response to the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, N501Y∆69-70 Spike,
E484 Spike, B.1.1.7 RBD, B.1.351 RBD, and E484K RBD. Luminex was used to quantify and
correlate the antibody isotypes (IgG1 and IgG3) and FcR binding (FcγRIIA-1 and FcγRIIIA)
response between WT Spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 variants Spike or RBD proteins. (B)
Serum was collected after vaccinations from individuals (n=237) vaccinated with NVXCoV2373, and the antibody response was profiled. Luminex was used to quantify and correlated
antibody isotypes (IgG1) and FcR binding (FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA). PCA plots show the
multivariate distribution of the antibody profiles across all macaques (C) and humans (D) for
Spike (left) or RBD (right) humoral immune responses. The color of the dots represents the sum
of the scaled magnitude of the labeled Spike (left) or RBD (right) variant humoral immune
response.
