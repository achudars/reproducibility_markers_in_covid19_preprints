Abstract:

20

The risk posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2)

21

dictates that live-virus research is conducted in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility.

22

Working with SARS-CoV-2 at lower biosafety levels can expedite research yet requires

23

the virus to be fully inactivated. In this study, we validated and compared two protocols

24

for inactivating SARS-CoV-2: heat treatment and ultraviolet irradiation. The two

25

methods were optimized to render the virus completely incapable of infection while

26

limiting destructive effects of inactivation. We observed that 15 minutes of incubation at

27

65˚C completely inactivates high titer viral stocks. Complete inactivation was also

28

achieved with minimal amounts of UV power (70,000 µJ/cm2), which is 100-fold less

29

power than comparable studies. Once validated, the two methods were then compared

30

for viral RNA quantification, virion purification, and antibody recognition. We observed

31

that UV irradiation resulted in a 2-log reduction of detectable genomes compared to

32

heat inactivation. Protein yield following virion enrichment was equivalent for all

33

inactivation conditions, but the resulting viral proteins and virions were negatively

34

impacted by inactivation method and time. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of

35

each method so that investigators might choose the one which best meets their

36

research goals.

Introduction:
The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 resulted in tremendous social and

40

economic distress. Factors affecting the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain

41

unclear, meriting considerable research investment. Research with infectious SARS-

42

CoV-2 must be performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions. While these

43

conditions excel at keeping researchers and the community safe, they lack the

44

expediency required for responding to a global pandemic. Researching SARS-CoV-2 at

45

a more accessible, lower biosafety level requires that the virus first be rendered non-

46

infectious [1]. Several effective methods have been devised to inactivate SARS-CoV-2,

47

but unfortunately many of these techniques destroy the structural and genetic properties

48

required for effective viral research.

49

In this study, we validated a pair of techniques that can each effectively

50

neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The two techniques—heat inactivation and ultraviolet (UV)

51

irradiation—both inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with differing effects on important viral

52

characteristics [2-4]. We discovered that heat inactivation is ideal for retaining genetic

53

material while UV irradiation allows for purification of high-quality virions. We establish

54

conditions for each method that completely inactivate viral infectivity and detail the

55

detection of viral components that will facilitate a researcher’s particular experimental

56

needs.

57

Materials and Methods:

58

Virus and Cells – SARS-CoV-2 strain WA01 was obtained from BEI Resources

59

(Manassas, VA). E6 Vero cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in

60

DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% pen-strep. Viral stocks were propagated and

61

titered on E6 Vero cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% pen-strep. Viral

62

stocks were made by collecting media from infected cell cultures showing extensive

63

cytopathic effect and centrifuged 1,000 RCF for 5 minutes to remove cellular debris.

64

The clarified viral supernatant was then used for all subsequent inactivation studies. For

65

determination of viral infectivity by plaque assay, E6 Vero cells were cultured then

66

incubated with viral inoculum at limiting dilutions. Following inoculation, cells were over-

67

layered with either 1 or 0.75% methylcellulose, DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and

68

1% pen-strep and incubated for 3-4 days [1,5]. Cells were then fixed and stained with

69

0.5% methylene blue/70% ethanol solution. Plaques were counted and the overall titer

70

was calculated.

71

Heat Inactivation - SARS-CoV2 viral supernatants were aliquoted into 1.5 mL screw cap

72

tubes and incubated in a 65˚C water bath for defined periods of time. Triplicate samples

73

were generated for each time point tested. The water bath was set to 65˚C and

74

validated with a thermometer. Tubes were placed into the water bath and held for 15,

75

20, 25, and 30 minutes. At each time interval three tubes were removed from the water

76

bath and placed onto chilled Armor Beads to quench the inactivation. Samples were

77

then subjected to limiting dilution and assessed by plaque assay as described above.

78

UV Inactivation – To UV inactivate SARS-CoV-2 we employed a UV sterilizing oven

79

(Fisher Cat No. 13-245-22) placed within a biosafety cabinet. This sterilizer is equipped

80

with 5 UV bulbs with peak emission around 254 nm (UV-C irradiation). UV exposure of

81

viral supernatants was conducted in an open top 10 cm Petri dish. Up to 15 mL of viral

82

supernatant was placed into three separate dishes and put into the sterilizer where the

83

lids were removed. The maximum depth of material was calculated at 1.5 mm. The

84

dishes were irradiated for the indicated time and the power recorded. At each time point

85

250 uL of viral supernatant was collected from the dish. Samples were then subjected to

86

limiting dilution as indicated and assessed by plaque assay as described above.

87

RNA quantification – The sequences of qPCR amplification primers for the SARS-CoV-

88

2 RdRp (Orf1ab) gene were: D2-8F_nCoV_RdRP forward primer 5'-

89

GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG -3', D2-8R_nCoV_RdRP reverse primer 5'-

90

CARATGTTAAASACACTATTAGCATA -3' [6].The sequence of RdRp gene TaqMan

91

probe was: D2-8P2_nCoV_RdRP 5'-/FAM/ CCAGGTGGWACRTCATCMGGTGATGC

92

/BHQ1/-3'. The sequences of qPCR amplification primers for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene

93

were: Forward Primer: D2-7F_nCoV_E 5'-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3',

94

Rev Primer: D2-7R_nCoV_E 5'-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3' [6]. The sequence

95

of E gene TaqMan probe was: 5'-/FAM/ ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG

96

/BHQ1/-3'. Samples were amplified using SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR

97

kit (Invitrogen 11732-020) with a final reaction volume of 10 µL. Primers and probes

98

were ordered from Eurofins Operon and were prepared as 100 µM stocks. The working

99

stocks of the primers were 25 µM with a final reaction concentration of 800 nM. The

100

working stock of the probe was 10 µM with a final reaction concentration of 200 nM.

101

Each reaction mix contained 0.05 µM ROX reference dye, 0.32 U/µL SUPERase RNase

102

Inhibitor (Invitrogen AM2694), and 1 µL of RNA. Thermocycling was performed in a real-

103

time qPCR machine (QuantStudio 3, Applied Biosystems): 1 cycle for 30 min at 60 °C, 1

104

cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles between 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C.

105

In vitro transcribed RNA. Standard curves were generated using serial dilutions of in

106

vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Orf1ab) and E genes. To generate the in vitro

107

transcribed RNA, gBlocks were ordered from IDT with a T7 promoter, forward and

108

reverse primer sites, and probe sequence for the RdRp (Orf1ab) gene and E gene of

109

SARS-Cov-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. The gBlocks were in vitro transcribed using a

110

MEGAscript T7 RNA Synthesis Kit (Ambion, AM1333) following manufacturers

111

instruction and purified over a GE Illustra Sephadex G-50 NICK column (Cytiva,

112

17085501). RNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer to

113

determine the copy number per µL.

114

Sucrose Cushion purification - Inactivated viral supernatant was overlayed onto a two-

115

step sucrose density cushion previously used to purify coronavirus particles [7]. The

116

phosphate buffered sucrose at 17% and 30% were layered on the bottom of

117

ultracentrifuge tubes. Viral supernatants were then layered on top of the sucrose and

118

then spun at 87,000 rcf for 2 hours in either a SW28 or SW21 rotor in a Beckman

119

ultracentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was decanted, and each pellet was

120

resuspended in up to 300 uL of Phosphate Buffered Saline.

121

Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting –

122

Protein content was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Briefly, resuspended

123

virion pellets were mixed with 2x loading buffer, heated to 95˚C for 5 minutes then

124

loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. For direct detection of protein bands, gels were

125

stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For detection of specific proteins, gel separated

126

proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were then blocked

127

with 5% dried milk in PBS- 0.1%Tween followed by incubation with SARS Coronavirus

128

130

antibody complexes were detected with goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen) or goat anti-rabbit

131

(Santa Cruz Biotech) HRP conjugated secondary antibodies. Reactive bands were

132

detected by ECL reagent and exposure to autoradiography film.

133

Electron Microscopy -

134

Viral samples were negatively stained by placing 5ul of resuspended virion pellets on a

135

300 mesh formvar coated copper grid and left for 30 seconds. Excess liquid was then

136

wicked off and 5ul of 2% uranyl acetate was applied. This stain was also wicked off after

137

30 seconds. The stained grids were viewed with a LEO 912 (Zeiss) transmission

138

electron microscope operated at 100KV accelerating voltage. Photos were taken with a

139

2K X 2K Proscan camera.

140

Detection of viral antigens by ELISA

141

Suspensions of purified virions were coated onto 96-well ELISA plates at 4ug total

142

protein per ml in PBS (50ul per well) and incubated at 4 degrees C overnight. Excess

143

protein was decanted and plates washed five times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (wash

144

buffer). Plates were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in wash buffer for 1 hour. Mid-titer

145

rabbit polyclonal serum obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA) was 2-fold

146

serially diluted in 1% nonfat milk in wash buffer, applied to plates, and incubated for 2

147

hours. Antisera was decanted and plates were washed as above, followed by

148

incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with a 1:3000 dilution of goat-anti-rabbit

149

secondary antibody conjugated to HRP in wash buffer with 1% nonfat milk. The extent

150

of antibody capture was measured by colorimetric detection following treatment with

151

TMB substrate and acid stop solution and quantified on a Molecular Devises

152

VERSAMax microplate reader.

Results:

154

Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by exposure to elevated temperature

155

The first method of inactivation we employed was the well-established procedure of

156

incubation at high temperature [2,8]. Viral supernatants were incubated in a water bath

157

at 65˚C for specific intervals of time. The principle of this method is that excessive heat

158

destabilizes viral proteins and assemblies, rendering them incapable of infection.

159

To test this inactivation method, a time course of heat exposure was conducted

160

in screw-cap tubes containing 1.4 mL of SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks. The water bath was

161

pre-heated for one hour with the temperature confirmed by an external thermometer.

162

The tubes were placed into the water bath and held for 15, 20, 25, or 30 minutes. At

163

each time point three tubes were removed from the water bath and placed onto chilled

164

beads to reduce temperature and prevent excessive inactivation. Samples were then

165

subjected to limiting dilution and assessed by plaque assay, as detailed in Table 1. Our

166

calculated titer at 0 minutes was 1.04 × 108 pfu/mL. Plaque assays performed on

167

clarified viral supernatant heated at 65°C for 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes resulted in zero

168

countable plaques (Table 1). This data demonstrates that a complete loss of viral

169

infectivity was observed following heat inactivation for all time points tested after T0.

170

Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by exposure to UV-C irradiation

171

To test the inactivation ability of UV-C, a time course of UV exposure was employed to

172

determine the minimal amount of UV irradiation required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2

173

[4,9]. Up to 15 mL of clarified viral supernatant was placed in a 10cm Petri dish without

174

a lid and exposed to UV-C irradiation for various amounts of time, as described in the

175

Materials and Methods. UV-C treated virus was then subjected to limiting dilution and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.14.383026; this version posted November 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

176

assessed by plaque assay. Initial testing looked at the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2

177

following 15s, 30s, 45s, 1 min, 2 min, 3min, and 4 min of UV-C exposure. The

178

calculated titer of unexposed viral stocks was 4.5 × 107 pfu/mL. We observed no viral

179

plaques at all UV-C exposure times. We therefore evaluated SARS-CoV-2 inactivation

180

following 2s, 5s, 10s, and 15s of UV-C exposure. The titer of unexposed stocks was

181

1.04 × 108 pfu/mL. Plaques were detected following 2s and 5s exposure, correlating to

182

1.39 × 105 pfu/mL and 10 pfu/mL, a 3- and 7-log reduction in infectivity, respectively.

183

Exposures of 10s or greater resulted in no detectable plaques demonstrating a

184

complete loss of virus infectivity (Table 2, Figure 1).

185

Calculating sufficient levels of UV-C irradiation

186

A common method of assessing efficacy of inactivation for UV-C irradiation is to

187

calculate a sterility assurance level [10]. The SAL is a standard used to estimate the

188

probability of a single viable pathogen being present in a sample following inactivation.

189

This standard is often used by manufacturers employing various irradiation-based

190

inactivation methods to validate that products are safe. Most companies use a SAL of

191

10-6, which indicates that there is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a non-sterile unit surviving

192

inactivation. For our purposes, calculating the SAL would not only help ensure

193

inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, but also determine the minimum amount of UV-C

194

necessary for sample inactivation. Based on intermediate inactivation values we were

195

able to calculate the dosage of UV-C radiation that reduces infectivity of a sample by

196

90% or one log10 (D10 value):

197

D10 value =

𝑈𝑉 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟
𝐿𝑜𝑔10(𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟) − 𝐿𝑜𝑔10(𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟)

198

The reduction in titer following 2 and 5 seconds of UV-C exposure leads to the

199

calculated dose needed to inactivate one log of SARS-CoV-2, which is 5,320 µJ/cm2

200

delivered by the UV sterilizer. Using this D10 value means that to reduce infectious titer

201

of 108 pfu/mL stock solution to a SAL of 10-6 would require an UV-C dose of 7.45 x104

202

µJ/cm2. This is equivalent to 10.4 seconds of exposure in the UV sterilizer under the

203

conditions we have described. It is critically important to utilize sufficient dosing of

204

irradiation to provide a greater margin for potential error. We have chosen a minimum

205

dose of 1.9 x105 µJ/cm2 as sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

206

Detection of RNA from Inactivated supernatants

207

Various methods are currently being used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 samples

208

prior to diagnostic testing by quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or Loop Mediated

209

Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) [11]. Given the importance of nucleic acids for these

210

tests, we sought to determine if either of our methods would differentially impact RNA

211

detection. We quantified the amount of RNA from both UV and heat inactivated samples

212

and compared the number of genomes that could be detected to an untreated sample.

213

RNA from the untreated and inactivated samples was extracted using the QiaAMP Viral

214

RNA kit and quantified with two different primer sets targeting the RdRp (Orf1ab) or E

215

gene of SARS-CoV-2. In vitro transcribed RdRp or E gene RNA was used to generate

216

standard curves for genome copy quantification. A serial dilution of each in vitro

217

transcribed RNA was performed to ensure that our different samples fell within the

218

linear detection limit of our assay. The dilutions of each in vitro transcribed RNA ranged

219

from 108 to 103 copies per µL and was plotted against the Ct value to determine the

220

efficiency of each reaction. The RdRp gene primer pairs produced a reaction efficiency

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.14.383026; this version posted November 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

221

around 95.22% and all samples fell within the linear range of the assay (Figure 2A). For

222

the E gene primer pairs the reaction efficiency was determined to be 98.71% and again,

223

all samples fell within the linear range of the assay (Figure 2B).

224

For the untreated sample, an average of 2.3 × 108 genome copies per µl were

225

detected by the RdRp primers and 1.4 × 108 genome copies per µl were detected by the

226

E primers. In contrast, UV inactivated samples treated for 1 minute had a 2 and 3 log

227

reduction in the amount of RNA detected with an average of 1.8 × 106 and 1.9 × 105

228

genome copies per µl detected by the RdRp and E primers, respectively. The amount of

229

RNA detected was further reduced as UV exposure times increased to 5 and 10

230

minutes. UV-C exposure for 10 minutes resulted in detection of an average of 1.2 × 105

231

and only 3.9 × 103 genome copies with the RdRp and E primers, respectively. The

232

genomic location of the RdRp and E genes, along with the increased variability in

233

detection via qRT-PCR, suggests that degradation of the RNA may be proceeding from

234

the 3' end of the genome following exposure to UV-C radiation. In contrast, heat

235

inactivation at T20 and T25 resulted in an average of 1.2 × 108 genome copies per µl

236

and at T30 an average of 1.6 × 108 genome copies per µl with the RdRp primers. The E

237

primers detected an average of 2.6 × 107, 3.6 × 107, and 2.7 × 107 genome copies per µl

238

from viral stocks heat inactivated for 20, 25, and 30 minutes, respectively. Compared to

239

UV treatment, heat inactivation did not disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowing for

240

comparable amounts of RNA detected compared to untreated controls. Overall, the E

241

primers resulted in slightly lower amount of RNA detected, which could be the result of

242

degradation from the 3' end of the genome and should be considered when designing

243

qRT-PCR assays for use with heat inactivated samples.

Purification of Virions from Inactivated Supernatant
To remove contaminates from inactivated virions, we employed a two-step

246

sucrose gradient purification previously described for the porcine epidemic diarrhea

247

virus (PEDV) [7]. Inactivated viral supernatants were subjected to high-speed

248

centrifugation through a two-step sucrose gradient to purify and concentrate virions for

249

downstream applications. Pelleted material was resuspended in PBS resulting in highly

250

concentrated SARS-CoV-2 virions.

251

Following resuspension, we assessed the purity of viral proteins by SDS-PAGE

252

prior to visualization by Coomassie or Western blot for viral proteins (Figure 3). Fewer

253

Coomassie stained bands were observed from UV-C inactivated material than from heat

254

inactivated material. This could indicate that UV-C treated virions are damaged or

255

cross-linked together, reducing detection of SARS-CoV-2 virion proteins. More likely,

256

the heat inactivation results in extensive protein denaturation and aggregation. These

257

aggregated proteins may non-specifically bind to virions, or co-precipitate in our

258

purification scheme.

259

The differences in protein yield are also reflected in Western blot analysis of

260

specific viral proteins. We see the most intense bands of both Spike and Nucleocapsid

261

protein come from heat inactivated material with no obvious differences between 20 and

262

30 minutes of heat exposure. UV-C irradiation results in reduced quantities of both the

263

aforementioned viral proteins. More importantly, excessive UV-C exposure at 5- and 10-

264

minutes results in a clear increase in a slower migrating species of Spike protein. This

slowly migrating species is likely the result of cross-linking between the proteolytically

266

cleaved portions of the Spike. Additionally, we observed that greater UV exposure

produced a minor, but detectable, amount of slower migrating N-protein that was not

268

detected at 1 minute of UV exposure.

269

Electron Microscopy analysis of inactivated virions

270

To better understand the state of the virion following inactivation and purification,

271

we subjected the resuspended, semi-purified virion pellets to examination under an

272

electron microscope (Figure 4). In all conditions, spherical structures with protuberances

273

that match descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 virions were readily detectable [12]. UV

274

inactivated virions revealed the most intact viral particles, with the virions subjected to

275

the lowest UV exposure appearing the most “normal”. Heat inactivated material, while

276

mostly comparable in appearance, exhibited deformed and disrupted virion structures

277

that increased in prevalence at longer inactivation times.

278

Detection of inactivated and purified virions by ELISA

279

Retaining the antigenicity of inactivated virus is an important consideration when

280

developing diagnostic assays or vaccines. To this end, we assessed the serological

281

detectability of our inactivated viruses using an indirect ELISA. Wells were coated with

282

equivalent amounts of viral protein prior to being exposed to a dilution series of SARS-

283

CoV-2-specific poly-clonal rabbit serum. Negative control rabbit serum was used to

284

measure the background binding capacity of the different preparations. As depicted in

285

Figure 5, all purified virion preparations had marginal background signal from the

286

negative control serum. We observed that detection of virion components was

287

influenced by the type and extent of inactivation. Optimal detection was observed for

288

samples receiving 1- or 5- minutes of UV-C irradiation, with no signal detected from the

289

10-minute sample. Heat inactivated material was also detected, but at a lower rate than

290

that of UV-C inactivated samples. Together, this suggests that short duration UV

291

exposure produces the higher quality of virions compared to heat inactivation.

292

Discussion:

293

Viral inactivation is a powerful tool for mitigating research risk while expediting scientific

294

objectives. The most useful methods of inactivation are effective and reliable without

295

being overly destructive to virion components. The goal of this study was to validate two

296

methods of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation—heat inactivation and UV-C irradiation—and

297

assess their respective effects on virion components. We observed that both techniques

298

were wholly effective at inactivating virus with minimal effects on virion morphology and

299

antibody mediated detection.

300

An important initial aspect of this study was to determine the appropriate levels of viral

301

inactivation by both methods. Insufficient inactivation puts researchers at risk for

302

exposure, while excessive inactivation can compromise important virion components

303

and limit research applicability. In this study, we observed that excessive UV-C

304

irradiation reduced SARS-CoV-2 detection by ELISA, likely due to significant cross-

305

linking of viral proteins observed by Western Blot. Many studies published on the

306

inactivation of beta-coronaviruses use significantly higher levels of UV-C irradiation than

307

what we report here [4,9,13]. Our methods significantly reduced UV-C exposure by

308

optimizing experimental conditions. Working in a biosafety cabinet, we removed the

309

plastic lids from the 10cm dishes that would have otherwise absorbed much of the

310

incoming UV-C radiation. Because UV-C is attenuated as a function of depth, we also

311

enhanced the surface area of exposure while limiting the fluid depth to less than 2mm,

312

ensuring equal inactivation of the sample throughout and limiting overexposure. In a

313

similar vein, heat inactivation was performed in small volume tubes (1.5 mL) in a water

314

bath to ensure the even heating and inactivation of samples throughout.

315

It is clear that while both methods effectively inactivated SARS-CoV-2, each had

316

unique effects on the virus that in turn affected downstream applications. Heat treatment

317

is a common method of viral inactivation that works via the denaturation of viral proteins

318

and disassembly of virion structures. It was interesting to see that heat inactivation,

319

even at excessive times, left virions mostly intact, an encouraging observation for

320

protocols that enrich virions based on the biophysical properties of intact structures. We

321

also observed that while heat treatment eliminated infectivity, viral genomes were left

322

largely intact. This made heat inactivation the preferred method for evaluations using

323

genome-based assays like PCR. Unlike heat inactivation, UV-C irradiation works

324

primarily by damaging SARS-CoV-2 RNA, preventing the transcription and replication of

325

viral genomes. We observed this method to be especially effective at retaining virion

326

morphology and antigenicity. Visualization of inactivated virions by electron microscopy

327

showed that UV-C irradiated samples retained much of their native viral structure.

328

These samples were also significantly more detectable by ELISA compared to samples

329

that were heat inactivated. Both UV-C irradiated, and heat inactivated samples yielded

330

near equivalent amounts of protein, though quality of viral proteins varied when

331

assessed by Western blot. This is important to note if considering downstream

332

applications for antigen detection or vaccine development.

333

The results of our study indicate that both heat inactivation and UV-C irradiation are

334

viable methods for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 for use in BSL-2 laboratory environments.

335

Both methods left the virion mostly intact while effects on other viral properties differed.

336

From this study it is clear that both the extent and method of inactivation have important

337

ramifications on SARS-CoV-2 virions that should be considered when planning

338

experiments or downstream applications.
