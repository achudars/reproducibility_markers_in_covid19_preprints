Abstract

28

In the fight against the spread of COVID-19 the emphasis is on vaccination or on reactivating

29

existing drugs used for other purposes. The tight links that necessarily exist between the virus as it

30

multiplies and the metabolism of its host are systematically ignored. Here we show that the

31

metabolism of all cells is coordinated by the availability of a core building block of the cell’s

32

genome, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This metabolite is also the key to the synthesis of the viral

33

envelope and to the translation of its genome into proteins. This unique role explains why evolution

34

has led to the early emergence in animals of an antiviral immunity enzyme, viperin, that

35

synthesizes a toxic analogue of CTP. The constraints arising from this dependency guide the

36

evolution of the virus. With this in mind, we explored the real-time experiment taking place before

37

our eyes using probabilistic modelling approaches to the molecular evolution of the virus. We have

38

thus followed, almost on a daily basis, the evolution of the composition of the viral genome to link it

39

to the progeny produced over time, particularly in the form of blooms that sparked a firework of

40

viral mutations. Some of those certainly increase the propagation of the virus. This led us to make

41

out the critical role in this evolution of several proteins of the virus, such as its nucleocapsid N, and

42

more generally to begin to understand how the virus ties up the host metabolism to its own benefit.

43

A way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect cells that are not

44

expected to grow, such as neurons. This may account for unexpected body sites of viral

45

development in the present epidemic.

Introduction

48

The development of the COVID-19 pandemic is being explored in a myriad of articles. Despite this

49

abundance, and because of our anthropocentrism, it is exceptional that these studies focus on the

50

virus’ standpoint. Of course, much work is looking into the details of the composition and structure

51

of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome, the proteins it codes for and its animal-infecting relatives.

52

However, there are very few major studies on how the virus exploits the metabolism of its host’s

53

cells. The urgent necessity to contain the disease led investigators to emphasize vaccination or,

54

more generally, the involvement of the host's immune system. It is well known, alas, that while it

55

has sometimes been relatively easy to generate a vaccine that is both effective and harmless

56

against a widespread disease, the opposite is also true. There are still very serious and very

57

common diseases for which there is no vaccination. Vaccinating effectively assumes, in particular,

58

that the progeny of a pathogen remains the same long enough to prevent escape of the immune

59

response triggered by the vaccine. Coronaviruses are viruses made up of a long genome and an

60

envelope. The length of the genome could have led to a very high mutation rate, but these viruses,

61

thus avoiding the universal constraint of Muller’s ratchet - see Box - have recruited a specific

62

function that proofreads and corrects replication errors [1]. This means that, while coronaviruses do

63

indeed tend to produce genetic variants over time, the number of these variants remains quite low.

64

This mutation rate may appear very limited, but the sheer number of viral particles generated

65

during an infection is enormous, while the human population currently recognized as infected

66

exceeds twenty million people. It follows that the mutation rate per nucleotide - of course very

67

heterogeneous due to the selection pressure on certain locations in the genome - is around 8 x 10-

68

4

69

Here, this situation was placed in the perspective of the fundamental theorem of natural selection

70

proposed by Fisher, which links the evolution of environmental fitness and genetic variance [3]. We

71

wished to use the marks left by the evolution of the virus’ fitness - observed in the form of genomic

72

sequences - in the presence of the biochemical constraints that bias the choices available for

73

evolution. We had to take into account, however, that the terms of the problem are not as explicit

74

as one might have wished: fitness is not known, nor are the time markers (estimated from

75

phylogenetic trees or simply taken as physical time) and the frequency of certain strains in the

76

phylogenetic trees may be less due to natural selection than to heterogeneity in sampling and

77

sequencing depth. This motivated our use of procedures that are robust enough to cope with these

78

uncertainties. Nevertheless, the advantage of such an analysis is that it allowed us to propose

79

anticipations for the evolution of the virus. It is therefore an explicit means of feeding

80

epidemiological or clinical models with relevant observations.

81

In this context, it seemed to us of great interest to explore the details of how SARS-CoV-2 mutated

82

over time, in the various places where COVID-19 has spread, highlighting relevant descents in

changes per site per year [2].

relation with the host metabolism. This should allow us to anticipate some of the future of the virus’

84

progeny, with important consequences for control of the disease. The analysis of the constraints

85

that govern access to the metabolism of the nucleotides that make up the virus genome has shown

86

us that the content of cytosine (C) in its genome is subjected to strong negative pressure, leading

87

to systematic depletion, over time, in cytosine monophosphate [4]. This bias has long been

88

believed to result from a major causal effect of the "editing" of the C content of the genome by the

89

family of APOBEC deaminating enzymes [5,6]. We now know that it is the organization of the

90

metabolism of pyrimidines in animal cells, and more particularly of cytosine triphosphate [7], which

91

drives the corresponding pressure on evolution (Figure 1).

Figure 1. CTP controls all crucial metabolic steps required to build up a functional SARSCoV-2 virus. 1/ CTP is a precursor of the virus genome; 2/ the lipids of its envelope derive from
cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors; 3/ all transfer RNA molecules produced by the host must
be maturated to a form ending in a CCA triplet at their 3’OH end; and 4/ post-translational
glycosylation of viral proteins, in particular its spike protein require a dolichyl-phosphate anchor in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and dolichol kinase is specifically dependent on CTP. See text and
reference [7] for details.

100

Indeed, due to the extreme asymmetry of the replication of the virus - which replicates 50 to 100

101

times from its complementary template [8] - a genome editing effect of these highly context-

102

dependent enzymes would only be significant when a C into U is modified on the negative RNA

template, which would lead to a major enrichment in A of the viral genome, or possibly from a U →

104

C transition due to another class of deaminating enzymes acting on double stranded RNA, ADAR,

105

that deaminates adenine into inosine [9]. Furthermore, both APOBEC and ADAR are highly specific

106

enzymes and this hardly fits with the widespread C → U transitions that we keep observing as the

107

virus evolves. Here, we have focused on the dynamics of the loss of C in the genome, and sought

108

for the locations and the causes of changes in this driving force. In the first paragraph, we

109

summarized the metabolic reasons accounting for this remarkable phenomenon. Subsequently, in

110

the body of the article, we showed that the constraint on the C content of the genome leads to

111

specific descents which can be used to reveal the existence of important functions of the virus as

112

well as the role of the host’s response.

113
114

A universal metabolic requisite, the biosynthesis of cytidine triphosphate (CTP), guides the
evolution of the virus

115

What do we know about the synthesis of the building blocks that allow the generation of a viral

116

particle (a virion)? During a viral infection cells usually stop multiplying. All their resources are

117

quickly diverted in favour of the multiplication of the virus. Yet, growth is a universal property of life.

118

This means that, almost always - differentiated neurons are an exception - the cell’s metabolism

119

that the virus faces is organized to allow cell growth as soon as the opportunity to multiply arises.

120

The moment it infects a cell - again, with the exception of those that do not multiply - any virus will

121

therefore have to manage the metabolic pressure that organizes the availability of the building

122

blocks necessary for its construction. In our usual physical space (three-dimensional), growing

123

introduces an inevitable constraint. The cell must put together the growth of its cytoplasm (three-

124

dimensional, therefore), that of the membrane that encloses it (two-dimensional) and that of its

125

genome (one-dimensional, because nucleic acids are linear polymers). However, it is a common

126

metabolism, developed mainly in the cytoplasm, which produces the building materials needed to

127

build up these three major compartments. So, here we have a question similar to the one asked by

128

economists when they raise the question of "non-homothetic" growth [10]. Unfortunately, because

129

life developed from a primitive metabolism in several stages over 3.5 billion years [10], we might

130

fear that many organisms had found an idiosyncratic solution to this constraint, as often witnessed

131

in the huge diversity of life forms. Unexpectedly, it appears that the solution to this quandary is

132

universal: a single metabolite, the nucleotide cytidine triphosphate (CTP), has been recruited to

133

this purpose [4,7].

134

The key role of CTP appears in four essential places in cellular metabolism, and these places are

135

essential for the formation of new virions. 1/ It is the immediate precursor of one of the four

136

nucleotides forming the genome of the virus; 2/ CTP is required for the synthesis of liponucleotide

137

precursors of the viral envelope; 3/ human transfer RNAs are synthesized from 415 genes which

138

do not encode their 3'OH-CCA terminal end - this sequence is synthesized from CTP by a specific

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.230607; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

139

nucleotidyltransferase [12]; and finally 4/ the "decoration" of proteins by complex glycosylations is

140

performed in parallel with their translation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the anchoring of

141

substrates by dolichyl-phosphate, produced by a kinase which uses CTP, not ATP, as its phosphate

142

donor [13]. In addition, intermediate metabolism is based on an original organization of the

143

metabolism of pyrimidines, which systematically recycles and salvages them via uridine

144

triphosphate (UTP) which makes CTP a pivot metabolite and limits considerably its availability

145

(Figure 1). As a result, accidental replication errors will tend to replace cytosine with uracil in the

146

genome.

147

General evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

148

Using the available sequence data gathered in the SARS-CoV-2 GISAID database

149

(https://www.gisaid.org) we have, like others [14,15], reconstituted a phylogenetic tree of the

150

evolution of the virus. As the sequences of each viral genome, as well as the date of identification

151

of these sequences are known with fairly great precision, this tree makes it possible to explore the

152

orderly lineage of the mutations which appear over time. In particular, unless we can suspect a

153

recombination event due to the infection of the same patient by two or more viruses, when two

154

identical mutations appear in separate branches of the tree, we can assume that this is the result

155

of evolutionary convergence [16]. The reasons for this convergence are discussed on a case by

156

case basis when analysing each relevant mutation. A second observation, which needs to be put in

157

perspective (see below), is that the shape of the tree is not at all homogeneous. We noticed indeed

158

the presence of "blooms" where, at a particular node of the tree, a large number of branches

159

appear, demonstrating an "explosive" appearance of new mutations (Figure 2). We have therefore

160

devised a statistical approach that allowed us to characterize them explicitly.

Figure 2. An example of bloom detected by our statistical approach. At node N0, there are 25
different states in the 40 samples of the subtree and a high number of branches. This behaviour
differs significantly from that of the other sub-trees.

165

The causes of these blooms are multiple, but the adaptation of important viral functions can be at

166

their origin, and we retained a few cases of this kind for further discussion (see Materials and

167

Methods for the statistical definition of blooms).

168

Description and analysis of the evolution of the C content of the genome

169

Generally speaking, the coronavirus genome tends to evolve by adapting its C content to the

170

metabolism of its host. More specifically SARS-CoV-2 evolves towards forms less rich in C as the

171

epidemic develops [7]. However, this development is not homogeneous.

172

In the two data sets of interest, 77% of the transitions between pyrimidines are represented by

173

transitions from cytosine to uracil. These transitions represent 48% of all substitutions identified in

174

the first set (respectively, 49% in the second). An important imbalance can also be noted at the

175

level of the transversions, knowing that more than 73% of those pertain to a substitution from

176

purine to pyrimidine in the first set (respectively, 74%). However, only 20% of these 73% lead to

177

the occurrnce of cytosine (respectively, 17%), indicating once again a tendency to favour the

178

generation of uracil, thus demonstrating that the major constraint of the mutagenic process is the

179

availability of each one of the nucleoside triphosphates in the cell. This inhomogeneity is also

180

salient at the tree level. At the level of branch B4 (20% of the samples), the tendency is strongly

181

marked to lose less C as compared to the rest of the tree (Figure 3).

183
184

Figure 3: Heat map of C losses from the original sequence. Branches 1 and 4 can be readily
discriminated by their extreme values.

185

Interestingly, this branch is also the one that comprises on average the strains with the least

186

divergence from the original strain of the virus. By contrast, in branch B1, the loss of C looks larger.

187

The rate of virus mutation also seems to be accelerating in this branch, with a rate of transversions

188

20% higher than the rest of the tree (and also higher transition rates, but in more anecdotal

189

proportions). Finally, for branch B3, the main site of blooms, a 29% decrease in the transition rate

190

of pyrimidines and a 30% decrease in the rate of purines compared to the rest of the tree is

191

noteworthy.

192

This inhomogeneity can be the consequence of many constraints:

193

1/ The very structure of the genome, which must fold into a compact capsid envelope requires

194

certain regions to maintain the presence of specific C residues. This is the case of the regions

195

which control the origin of replication [8] or transcription, AACGAAC, for example [17]. In the case

196

of the translated regions, the pressure on the presence of C varies depending on its position in the

197

codon trinucleotides. When C is located at the first position of a codon, it is used to input arginine,

198

glutamine, histidine, leucine or proline into proteins. Histidine and glutamine are coded in two

199

codon families, discussed below. For arginine, the selection pressure is lower because the CGN

200

codons can be replaced by AGR codons - we used here the IUPAC convention for labelling

201

nucleotides or aminoacids, e.g. N is for aNy, R for puRine, etc.

202

(https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html). The selection pressure on the leucine content is

203

also lower, since in addition to the CUN codons, this amino acid can be input using the UUR

204

codons. In the second codon position, C is again used to code for proline, but also threonine

205

(ACN), alanine (GCN) and serine (UCN). Again, the latter amino acid escapes a large part of the

206

constraint imposed by the availability of C because it can also use the AGY codons. Finally, the

207

third position of the codons is much less constrained because it can be replaced by U but also by A

208

or G in the families with four codons (alanine, proline, threonine, valine). The two codon families

209

UGY, AGY and NAY are discriminated along a pyrimidine / purine axis. A pyrimidine is used to

210

maintain the same nature of the coded residue, as the codon uses a U or C as the 3 'end

211

(aspartate, asparagine, cysteine, histidine and tyrosine). Finally, isoleucine is coded by three

212

codons (AUH), and ending in U or C is taken into account by relevant tRNAs [18];

213

2/ The function of the virus proteins can impose the presence of certain amino acids in their

214

sequence. For example, the proline residue encoded by the CCN codons is not strictly an amino

215

acid, but is essential for the folding of key domains of viral proteins [19];

216

3 / Further stressing the importance of CTP, during evolution, innate antiviral immunity recruited the

217

activity of an enzyme, viperin, which modifies CTP into a form toxic to the development of the virus,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.230607; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

218

3ʹ-deoxy-3′,4ʹ-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) [20]. An interesting consequence of this pathway is that

219

decreasing the C content of the genome will allow the virus replication process to be less sensitive

220

to the presence of this nucleobase. It follows that, during the transfer of a virus relatively rich in C

221

from an animal host to human beings, the evolution towards the loss of C may be transiently

222

concomitant with an increase in its pathogenicity. In the long term, however, the loss of C severely

223

restricts the evolutionary landscape of the virus and most likely will tend to its attenuation [21].

224

Examples of correlations allowing us to propose a function for viral proteins

225

Thousands of mutations have been identified at this date. It is possible to follow their emergence

226

along the tree of its phylogenetic evolution of the virus and then highlight some interesting features

227

that may allow us to anticipate some of its future.

228

Mutations leading to an early translation termination

229

Mutations leading to premature termination of the virus protein synthesis are expected to appear

230

with high frequency. In the present context, this is all the more likely because the translation

231

termination codons UAA, UAG and UGA do not contain C, and are therefore favoured by the

232

disappearance of this nucleotide. Since most of these mutations lead to non-functional

233

polypeptides, it is generally probable that the affected viruses do not give rise to a significant

234

progeny. It follows that when these mutations are observed - and that they do not result from

235

sequencing errors - they indicate that the role of the truncated protein corresponds to a function

236

which is not critical, or that the protein has remained functional at a sufficient level to allow virus

237

reproduction. However, a few observations allowed us to offer an explanation for the fact that the

238

viruses in question may have survived. Here are three examples which reveal interesting features

239

of the virus.

240

Example 1: In a strain from Iceland, the succession of mutations G1440A (Gly392Asp, protein

241

Nsp2) and G2891A (Ala876Thr, ubiquitin-like domain of protein Nsp3) is now present in multiple

242

world locations [22]. This sequence ends up with C27661U (which modifies amino acid Gln90 into

243

a premature translation end, near the carboxy-terminal end of protein Orf7a). This viral protein is

244

found in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and the perinuclear space [23]. Several

245

variants have been identified in the course of the epidemic [24]. Remarkably, several deletions

246

have been isolated in the gene, which suggests that the function of this region is not essential [25].

247

However, we noticed that many of these mutations, as the one discussed here, keep the small

248

hydrophobic protein Orf7b gene intact, downstream of Orf7a. This very small protein is present in

249

the Golgi apparatus and is also found in the purified virus [26]. It must be noticed that it is

250

synthesized in vivo via a frameshift that spans the termination codon of the Orf7a frame (...GAA

251

TGA TT... becomes ...GA ATG ATT...). This can be interpreted as a conflict in this region between

252

translation of Orf7a and Orf7b, creating a cost / benefit dilemma for the expression of either one of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.230607; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

10
253

these proteins. Hence it will be important to monitor the future descent of the virus in this region as

254

it may result in interesting attenuated forms.

255

Example 2: Another succession of mutations that leads to premature translation termination of a

256

viral protein begins with G11083U (protein Nsp6, Leu37Phe). This mutation is now widely

257

distributed worldwide. It is likely to induce a more stable binding of the protein to the ER, possibly

258

favouring coronavirus infection by compromising delivery of viral components to lysosomes for

259

degradation [27]; then we have G1397A (Nsp2, Val378Ile), also likely to favour virus propagation

260

[28]; followed by G29742U (3’UTR of the virus), and U28688C (synonymous); subsequently, we

261

have the couple of mutations C884U (Nsp2 again, Arg207Cys [28]) and G8653U (Nsp4, essential

262

for envelope assembly [29]. The corresponding change (Met2796Ile) is located at the border of the

263

ER lumenal domain of the protein. It is known that, in order to function properly, the ER requires

264

the presence of oxygen [30], and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated to misfolding of

265

proteins in this compartment. Nsp4 has a number of cysteine residues, prone to be oxidized. The

266

role of methionine in the parent might be to act as a buffer against ROS, so that the mutant would

267

be slightly attenuated). These mutations are followed by A19073G (in the methylase domain of

268

protein Nsp14, Asp1869Gly, a position that already evolved from SARS-CoV-1 [31], hence likely to

269

be more or less neutral), then the couple with the mutation resulting in end of translation:

270

G27915U, Gly8 to end of translation at the N-terminus of Orf8 and C29077U (synonymous); the

271

succession ends with the couple of mutations leading to synonymous changes C19186U and

272

G23608U. This region of SARS-related coronaviruses is hypervariable. It changes during the

273

course of epidemics, showing that it is subject to ongoing selection pressure, sometimes producing

274

two peptides Orf8a and Orf8b [32]. It corresponds to proteins expressed at the end of the infection

275

cycle. It will be important to monitor the way they function in the course of the evolution of virulence

276

of the virus. This displays a branching that appeared in four different countries and in seven

277

samples, spanning six weeks between the first and the last mutation.

278

Example 3: Here we have a succession of mutations that begin within the 5’end of the virus

279

genome, C241U, followed by mutation C14408U (Pro314Leu) at the end of a zinc finger in

280

replicase Nsp12, which appears in many branches of the evolution tree of the virus. It is discussed

281

in details below (origin of blooms). This mutation is followed by A23403G (Asp614Gly) a widely

282

spread mutation of the spike protein (also discussed below), C3037U (synonymous), mutation

283

G25563U (Gln57His) in Orf3a forming potassium channels is supposed to negatively interfere with

284

the function of the protein [33], C1059U (Thr265Ile) in protein Nsp2, discussed previously, and the

285

triplet G4181A (Ala1305Thr) in the SUD-N domain of protease Nsp3, then mutations G4285U

286

(Glu1340Asp), and G28209U which results in an end of translation at glutamate 106 of protein

287

Orf8. As discussed previously, many mutations, including deletions in Orf8, were frequently

288

observed. This is again an indication that evolution of this regions should be carefully monitored to

look for attenuated forms of the virus. This particular mutation to an end of translation is significant

290

as it was found in a sample from Croatia, another one from Thailand, on two significantly separated

291

branches and with one month difference. The sequence of mutations here corresponds to the

292

Thailand sample.

293

Reversal of the tendency of the viral genome to lose its cytosine residues

294

We have here retained two examples of a situation where, from an upstream branching point in the

295

evolution tree, it appears that the descendants of the virus stop losing their cytosines, and may

296

even tend to regain them. These examples are as follows (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Two sub-trees in the first dataset where the tendency of the genome to lose its
cytosine residues is reversed. Upper panel. First sub-tree. The sub-samples displayed are
those that have acquired the most C, apart from a few isolated samples on other branches. The
node with the M1 mutation directly follows those respectively associated with the C8782U and
U28144C mutations. Lower panel. Second sub-tree. This tree contains a majority of strains with
a neutral C balance (both gained and lost), as well as 3 strains with more C gained than lost.

305

In dataset 1, there are two sub-trees, the first of which is more of an Asian sub-tree with the root of

306

the node associated with the M2 and M3 mutations. The second contains samples from North

307

America and Oceania, and its root node is related to the M6 and M7 mutations. The first tree arises

308

from the succession of C8782U (synonymous), U28144C (Leu84Ser) mutations in the Orf8 protein,

309

whose function was discussed above. It defines a major clade of variants of the virus [24],

310

C24034U (synonymous), and finally the doublet U26729C (synonymous), G28077C (Val62Leu), in

311

the Orf8 protein again. As this is the origin of the observed phenomenon, we are led to believe that

312

it is the alteration of the role of Orf8 (8a or 8b) that is responsible. The Orf8 region is particularly

313

variable and has been clearly implicated in interspecies transmission [34]. A common hypothesis is

314

that the alteration of this gene corresponds to a loss of active function in chiropteran ancestors

315

[35]. Since these are generally richer in cytosine than the human forms [21], one might ask

316

whether one of the functions of this protein is to modulate the activity of CTP synthase.

317

In fact, the second branch comes from the same descent, to which is added the U490A (Asp75Glu)

318

mutation in the Nsp1 protein, which controls the specific translation of viral RNA [36],

319

systematically associated with the mutation C3177U (Pro971Leu) in the acidic domain, without any

320

clearly identified function, of the multifunctional protease Nsp3 [37], and finally the U18736C

321

(Phe1757Leu) doublet of the exonuclease, N7-methyltransferase Nsp14, and A29700G in the

322

3'UTR region of the virus. The Phe1757Leu modification is located in the middle of a zinc binding

323

site at the interface between the two domains of the Nsp3 protein. It can therefore be surmised that

324

this mutation could subtly change the proofreading process correcting replication errors in a way

325

that would be less amenable to the entry of UTP opposite an A in the negative viral template. We

326

noted that 3 out of the 5 samples that acquired the most C did so through a transition from U to C.

327

The first one, HongKong/HKPU1_2101, shows two simultaneous transitions at positions 12877 and

328

23857. These mutations being synonymous, they are unlikely to change the replication-correction

329

mechanism. The second one, USA_SC_3571, and the third one, Australia/VIC209, show

330

transitions of the same type, also synonymous, at positions 11635 and 19713 respectively. Finally,

331

the last two samples, USA/WI-33 and USA/WI-28, were derived from the transversion from A to C

332

at position 29567, a mutation at the end of ORF9b.

333

For dataset number 2, this reversal of the trend concerns mostly Latino-American strains. The

334

succession of mutations C241U, C14408U, then A23403G discussed in relation to the generation

335

of end of translation codons in the virus genes, is followed by C3037U (synonymous), and the

336

triplet G28881A, G28882A, G28883C, overlapping the codons at position 203-204 of the N

337

nucleocapsid N gene. They mutate an arginine-glycine dipeptide into a lysine-arginine dipeptide.

338

This alters the positive charge of the protein and may help improve its role in the assembly of the

339

virus genome in the capsid, as discussed below in relation to the appearance of blooms (36). After

340

this triple modification, we see several reversals of the tendency to lose C in the genome.

341

U29148C (Ile292Thr) is found again in the nucleocapsid N gene, then U27299C (Ile33Thr) in the

342

Orf6 gene, resulting in a set of samples that have at worst gained as much C as they have lost.

343

There are also 3 samples among the 39 in the subtree that gained one more C than they lost

344

(Brazil/RJ-763, Argentina/Heritas_HG007, Argentina/Heritas_HG006). Each time, the last C

345

acquisition comes from a transversion from an adenine (in positions 14164 (Met233Leu), 16076

346

(Asp870Ala), and 29782, in the late 3'UTR of the viral genome. Overall, it is the change in the

347

nucleocapsid that appears to be most conducive to reversing the tendency to lose C. Indeed, this

348

protein, expressed at a high level during the infection, regulates the process of replication /

349

transcription of the virus and this may account for this remarkable observation [39].

350

Emergence of blooms

351

The succession C3037U, (C241U, A23403G), C14408U is present upstream of 10 sub-trees,

352

which we considered to be significant (see Figure 5 and Materials and Methods).

356

Figure 5: Example of blooms The subtree shown here contains 10 of the 20 most significant
blooms in the sense of the method we used. Node N0 is the place where mutation C14408U
emerges.

357

The synonymous mutation C3037U is located at the end of the ubiquitin-like domain 1 of protein

358

Nsp3. This leads to a sequence (UUUUUU) that promotes changes in the reading frame and could

359

decrease the translation efficiency of the proteins of the ORF1a region. The C241U mutation is

360

observed very often [40]. It is found in the region that initiates replication of the virus. We can

361

therefore assume that this may alter the frequency of replication. A23403G is a widely spread non-

362

synonymous mutation which leads to the replacement of an aspartate by a glycine at position 614

363

of the spike protein, which is used by the virus to bind its host cell’s receptor. For this reason,

364

several previous analyses have suggested that this mutation has an important role in the spread of

365

the virus [41,42]. Here, the fact that it is part of a major bloom can be considered as an additional

366

argument favouring this interpretation. The C14408U changes an amino acid from proline to

367

leucine (Pro314Leu) just after the end of the NiRAN domain (nidovirus RdRp-associated

368

nucleotidyl transferase) of the protein Nsp12 ending in a "zinc finger". The NiRAN domain,

369

essential for the replication of the virus, acts as a nucleotidyltransferase, preferring UTP as a

370

substrate for a function which has not yet been clarified [43]. The proline modified in the mutant is

371

part of a dipeptide diproline which plays the role of hinge of separation between the NiRAN domain

372

and the following domain.

373

A second bloom, which shares several elements with the preceding one begins with the same

374

sequence C3037U, (C241U, A23403G) and C14408U. However it continues with a series of

375

contiguous mutations resulting in a change (G28881A, G28882A, G28883C) in nucleocapsid N, as

376

we saw previously. It is worth noticing that this change might have a role in assembling the virus

377

genome in the capsid by phase separation [38]. This might increase the efficiency of virus

378

transmission and thus contribute to the formation of blooms. The fact that it is a cluster of

379

mutations involving G is intriguing. It may result from the fact that it spans a GGGG sequence.

380

We have previously seen that mutation G11083U (protein Nsp6, Leu37Phe) has initiated another

381

succession of mutations that led to premature translation termination of a viral protein. Here, this

382

widely distributed mutation is at the root of blooms. As discussed, it is possibly favouring

383

coronavirus infection by compromising delivery of viral components to lysosomes for degradation.

384

This would certainly favour blooms. The mutation is followed, in a first bloom-generating

385

succession, by G26144U (Gly251Val) in protein Orf3a, that forms potassium channels important for

386

innate immunity response - but the exact function of the protein still remains open to question [44].

387

Subsequent mutations are C14805U (synonymous) and U17247C (synonymous). This succession

388

suggests that the first mutation in protein Nsp6 and perhaps the second one are the primary

389

causes of the bloom [27]. The role of the fist mutation is further substantiated by the second bloom-

390

generating succession where it is followed by a quadruplet: C6312A (Thr2016Lys) in the inter-

391

domain region that precedes domain G2M of multi-domain protease Nsp3, then associated with

392

three C → U mutations, hence expected to be more frequent: C13730U (Ala88Val) in the NiRAN

393

domain of protein Nsp12, C23929U (synonymous), and finally C28311U (in a sequence of four C,

394

Pro13Leu) at the beginning of the nucleocapsid protein, N.

395

A second succession of mutations that ends up in blooms is C8782U (synonymous), U28144C

396

(Leu84Ser) in protein Orf8, the function of which has been discussed previously and defines a

397

significant clade of the virus variants [24], ending up with C26088U (synonymous). The Leu84Ser

398

mutation co-evolves significantly with the Asp614Gly mutations of the spike protein discussed

399

above [37], which makes it another likely candidate for positive selection leading to increased

400

spreading of the virus, hence blooms.

401

Change in frequency of transitions / transversions

402

Among the mutations upstream of branches showing significant changes in the transition /

403

transversion flow is the mutation C17747U, which modifies a proline residue into a leucine residue

404

in the protein Nsp13 (Figure 6 and Materials and Methods).

Figure 6. One of the descents considered to be significant for the change in the process of
molecular evolution. The progeny resulting from the C17747U mutation is shown in yellow, and
its evolutionary process is modelled by a 6-parameter TN93 model (process 1). The rest of the tree
(blue leaves) is modelled by a 3-parameter TN93 model.

410

This mutation affects the protein domain which has nucleoside triphosphatase activity, the exact

411

role of which is unknown but consistent with a proofreading activity [45]. We might propose that it is

412

involved in the quality control of the product of the replication of the virus for example via stabilizing

413

the “anti” form of nucleotides, thus avoiding the mismatching leading to transversions. In fact, this

414

protein has been identified among those which lead to a significant alteration in the diversity of the

415

viral genome [16]. The existence of a notable change in the type of mutations located downstream

416

of the tree is therefore a strong argument for the discriminating role of the corresponding region of

417

the protein. Furthermore, to the extent that this mutation increases the frequency of mutations in a

418

biased manner, we can expect the ensuing descent to lead to an attenuation of the virus. However,

419

as this changes the evolutionary landscape, this evolution could lead to “innovative” mutations

420

modifying the pathogenicity of the virus, and this especially under conditions where recombination

421

due to co-infections would be favoured. This is yet another argument for choosing a strong public

422

health policy which tends to avoid the formation of clusters of infection.

423

Conclusions and perspectives

424

The COVID-19 epidemic is a life-size experiment in virus evolution. Remarkably, we neither know

425

the real origin of the virus [46], nor where it will lead us. This explains why the vast majority of

426

studies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its evolution are essentially descriptive. Here, we tried to

427

make use of the ongoing evolution of the virus to investigate some of its related constraints using a

428

hypothesis-driven probabilistic modelling approach to the molecular evolution of the virus. Based

429

on the assumption that the virus’metabolism is ruled by its host. Based on the metabolic set up of

430

the host cells, acting as a compulsory material framework for the multiplication of viral particles, we

431

pointed out specific changes in the evolution pattern of the virus descent, witnessed by changes in

432

the virus genome composition as time passes. Using the widely spread C to U change in this

433

genome’s composition as a base line, we identified nodes where the change is shifted from this

434

direction to another one, favouring transversions rather than transitions, reversing the C to U trend

435

towards U to C enrichment or generating blooms with sudden appearance of multiple branches in

436

the evolution tree. This allowed us to point out a series of functions that are evolving towards a

437

more efficient spread of the virus (e.g. the previously identified Asp214Gly mutation of the spike

438

protein, but also the Gln57His mutation of the Orf3a potassium channel). We also noticed that Orf8

439

is the likely site of an ongoing competition for expression of two frameshift-dependent overlapping

440

proteins Orf8a and Orf8b. Similarly, the unstable region of Orf7 could promote the synthesis of the

441

very small membrane protein Orf7b, whose function remains unknown to date. Finally, the

442

reversion of the tendency to favour U over C indicates that nucleocapsid protein N may be involved

443

in the control of CTP synthesis in the host, suggesting an interesting target for future control of the

444

virus development. We hope that this combination of mathematical and biochemical knowledge will

445

help us devise further enterprises against the dire consequences of COVID-19. We noticed that

446

among the possible way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect

447

cells that are not expected to grow, such as neurons. This may account for unexpected body sites

448

of viral development observed in the present epidemic.

Data processing

456

A total of 4,792 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were recovered from the GISAID databank

457

[47] on April 21, 2020 for the first dataset. Only the genomes of viruses from the human hosts of

458

SARS-CoV-2 of a length greater than 25,000 bp were retained. Sequences for which the sampling

459

date was insufficiently informed (absence of the harvest day, sometimes of the month) were also

460

excluded. For sequences present multiple times, only the first isolate was retained. We also reused

461

the work of the Nextstrain teams and discarded the too divergent or unstable samples that they

462

themselves had left out (github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/defaults/exclude.txt).The

463

sequence of 26 coding regions (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp4, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp10,

and ORF10) was characterized using NC_045512 as a reference. The total number of sequences

466

retained at the end of the treatment is 4,088 sequences. A second dataset of 3,246 sequences,

467

510 of which are common with the first dataset, was retrieved on July 6, 2020 using directly the

468

Nextstrain API [48].

469

We note here that, over time, data availability kept being altered, with some sequences deleted

470

from the samples, while other ones entered the database. Furthermore, it was generally difficult to

471

extract large samples of sequences so that it was extremely difficult to build up a consistent data

472

repository where correct statistical approaches could be implemented. It seems very awkward that

473

the bulk of the sequences of a virus of worldwide importance has not been made available at the

474

International Nucleotide Sequence Database despite recommendations of the major research

475

institutions [49,50].

476

Phylogenetic reconstruction

477

The reconstruction process begins with aligning all of the sequences to the reference sequence.

478

Insertions and deletions of genome regions were not taken into account. It was out of the question

479

here to take into account nucleotide insertions and deletions. We retained only the potential one to

480

one substitutions. We used program MAFFT [51] to generate these alignments. Some ambiguous

481

positions were highlighted during the alignment process. For example, some regions of the

482

genome may display high instability and wide variability depending on the parameters of the

483

algorithm used to perform the alignment. To overcome this problem, we used the same masks as

484

those used by the Nextstrain team. Sites 18529, 29849, 29851, 29853, as well as the first 130 and

485

last 50 sites of the genome were therefore omitted from the substitution analysis. We used a

486

General Time Reversible (GTR) model to infer the substitution process at work using the IQTREE

487

software [52]. This first tree is a fairly raw version which does not take into account the temporal

488

aspect of evolution. The Treetime software [53] allows you to refine this tree by also taking into

489

account the sampling dates of the sequences. It then reconstructs the tree with maximum

490

likelihood compared to the sampled sequences. Using maximum likelihood approaches it also

491

infers the compositions of the ancestral sequences of the samples, as well as a 90% confidence

492

interval around the most likely date of these common ancestors. Once the tree has been created,

493

we could then reconstruct the order in which the mutations in each sample appeared, in the sense

494

of maximum likelihood. For the visualization of the tree and the production of Figures 2 to 6, we

495

used the Auspice program developed by Nextstrain, to which we made some modifications to

496

display the parameters we were interested in. To this purpose, we developed a Python script to

497

modify the JSON file used as input by the Auspice program. This allowed us to enrich the

498

visualization capabilities of the software by adding quantities such as the number of C acquired or

499

lost by a sample compared to the reference and to generate original tree presentations.

Identification of blooms

501

The main pitfall we had to face when identifying blooms was the bias introduced when selecting

502

samples from the phylogenetic tree. In particular, some hospitals were likely to provide more

503

samples than others, due to the different health policies and means implemented depending on the

504

country. In order to avoid selecting nodes likely to generate a bloom due to oversampling, we

505

chose to develop a custom-made statistical method meant to cope with this difficulty.

506

A subtree is any set of nodes and leaves rooted in one of the nodes of the main tree. The idea is to

507

use the information provided by the identity of the countries represented in each sub-tree: the

508

easier a strain is spread, the higher the number of countries in which it is expected to be observed.

509

To implement this heuristic, it is necessary to control two factors: the size of the tree (two trees of

510

unequal depth, that is to say rooted on different dates, naturally show diversity as different

511

countries) and the heterogeneity of sampling (countries where sampling and sequencing are

512

carried out with different intensities have different probabilities of appearing in a given sub-tree).

513

These two factors interact, because the size of a tree (the number of its leaves for example)

514

obviously varies with the sampling intensity. One way to control this interaction is to measure the

515

size of a tree by its total length, or sum of branch lengths, in time units. Indeed, this observable is

516

not very sensitive to the effects of oversampling because the presence of many sequences

517

sampled in the same place at about the same time generates a sub-tree whose length is close to

518

zero.

519

To control the effect of the length factor L on the number of countries represented, N, we seeked to

520

learn the relation N = f(L) in a typical tree in order to be subsequently able to identify the sub-trees

521

whose number of countries represented, for a known length L, exceeds the expected f(L). A simple

522

statistical model consists in supposing that the number of occurrences of country i in a tree of

523

length L is a Poisson distribution of parameter θiL and that these numbers are independent. If K is

524

the total number of countries referenced by Nextstrain, the number of countries N represented in a

525

tree of length L is therefore the sum of K Bernoulli variables independent of parameters 1 - exp (-

526

θiL). For example, if countries are divided into two groups, the k1 'frequent' of intensity θ1, and the

527

k2 'rare' of intensity θ2<<θ1, N has the mean K – k1exp(-θ1L) – k2exp(-θ2L),

528

which behaves when L is large like K – k2exp(-θ2L).

529

In addition, when L is large, assuming that θ2L = O(1), the distribution of N is approximately equal

530

to k1 + N2, where N2 foloows a Poisson law of parameter k2(1-exp(-θ2L)).

531

So, we used the parameterization:

532

N = a - bexp(-cL), interpreting the parameters as follows: a is the maximum number of countries, b

533

is the number of countries with low sampling/sequencing intensities and c is a density of presence

534

of these countries per unit length of tree. Under the null hypothesis, N is distributed as a - b + N1,

535

where N1, follows the Poisson's law of parameter b(1-exp(-c L)). Finally, we selected the 20 most

536

significant blooms, i.e., those whose behaviour deviated the most from that expected by our

537

estimator. This then allowed us to reconstruct the lineages and the mutations that appeared

538

successively upstream of each node at which a bloom had occurred. This allowed us to identify the

539

succession of mutations common to some of these nodes and thus those giving rise to the majority

540

of statistically significant blooms. Furthermore, we restricted the automatic selection of nodes so

541

that no selected node was present in the lineage of another one. The selected blooms are

542

therefore mutually independent, even though they may obviously have common ancestors. To

543

arbitrate the choice between two nodes present in the same lineage, we have systematically kept

544

the oldest node, and thus the most dense tree.

545

Detection of changes in the molecular evolutionary process

546

We investigated whether the substitution process in some sub-trees behaved differently from what

547

was observed in the rest of the tree, statistically speaking. To this aim, we used the classical TN93

548

model from Tamura and Nei [54] with 3 parameters (purine transition rate, pyrimidine transition rate

549

and transversion rate) and allowed these three rates to take, downstream of a candidate node Ni,

550

values that differed from those they take in the rest of the tree. We then used a second (6-

551

parameter) model. Since this model is nested in the first (3-parameter) model, we used as test

552

statistic the likelihood ratio 2Δl = 2(l1 - l0), where l0 is the log-likelihood under assumption H0 (3-

553

parameter TN93 model estimating all the elements of the tree) and l1 is the log-likelihood under

554

assumption H1 (6-parameter TN93 model with local differentiation of the parameters downstream of

555

a node of interest). We then compared the likelihood ratio to a distribution of the \chi² with 3

556

degrees of freedom, whose significance threshold at 5% is 7.81. We were then able to identify the

557

nodes from which the evolution process varied significantly and to quantify the variations of the

558

different substitution rates, i.e. the nodes for which we can reject the H0 hypothesis that the 3-

559

parameter model TN93 produces better estimates of tree substitution rates than the 6-parameter

560

model TN93. We have chosen to implement these models ourselves in Python, in order to keep

561

this parametrization flexibility. The program allows us to determine the set of nodes and leaves

562

present downstream of a node of interest and to perform hypothesis testing by calculating the

563

likelihood ratio and the different substitution rates.

565

Molecular evolution and Muller’s Ratchet

566

Biology rests on the laws of physics. Because it develops at approximately 300K, it is subject to the

567

universal stress of thermal noise, involving an energy that does not differ considerably from that

568

involved in the chemical bonds of biological chemistry. It follows that the reactions that come

569

through and organize living things cannot develop with strict reproducibility. Inevitable errors cause

570

the product of a reaction to differ from what it is supposed to be. Genome replication cannot

571

escape this constraint. The consequence is that, in the progeny of a virus, there is always a

572

number of variants, named mutants when they carry over alterations of the genome. In most

573

cases, these mutants correspond to the change from one of the four nucleotides to a different one.

574

This process, as a rough approximation, is random — the mutant position can be anywhere in the

575

genome, and the replacement of one nucleotide is by any of the other three. As time goes by, all

576

the nucleotides of the genome are likely to change into others. This will affect the functions

577

necessary for the multiplication of the virus, and some changes will continue to be propagated (be

578

fixated), while others will end up without a progeny. A mutation followed by a fixation is called a

579

substitution. The substitution of a purine for a pyrimidine (or vice versa) is called a transversion;

580

other substitutions are called transitions. The likelihood of a particular mutation returning to the

581

ancestral state is very low. The probability that a particular mutation will return to the ancestral

582

state is very low. This forces evolution to always go forward, without the possibility of going back.

583

This process was noticed in 1932 by Hermann Muller in the special case of the effects of irradiation

584

on mutagenesis. His reflection has since been simplified and popularized. It is now known as the

585

"Muller’s ratchet" [55]. It is obviously highly probable that the majority of mutations leads to the

586

partial or total loss of the functions coded by the altered regions of the genome. It follows that this

587

generally leads, in the long term - but not in the short term - to the attenuation of the functions

588

allowing multiplication and virulence of pathogenic species. This is why Louis Pasteur and his

589

successors could have the luck to isolate attenuated organisms which, in some - rare - cases,

590

could then be used for the vaccination of infected persons [56]. However, this process becomes

591

unproductive as soon as co-infection with different mutants occurs under circumstances where

592

recombination is possible. Two different mutants can recombine into the ancestral form of the

593

pathogen and erase the entire benefit of attenuation. This is all the more harmful since the old

594

forms are also, very often, those which spread most easily.

Boxed text Figure. Muller’s ratchet and recombination The figure is reprinted from reference
[57]. Genes (capitals) are mutated at random in a different form (low case). Mutations accumulate
ratchet-like because the probability of reversion to the parent form is negligible. This happens
independently for viruses of different descents. However, if viruses from different descent happen
to be in the same cell, they can recombine. This allows them to recreate the ancestral form of the
virus.
