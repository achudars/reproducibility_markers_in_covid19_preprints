SUMMARY

9

Palatine tonsil (hereinafter referred to as “tonsil”) plays role in the immune system’s first line

10

of defense against foreign pathogens. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe

11

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic

12

since the infection was first reported in China in December 2019. The aim of this study was to

13

establish tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and to examine their feasibility as an ex vivo

14

model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using an optimized protocol, we achieved 3D tonsil

15

organoid culture from human tonsil tissue that reflects the distinctive characteristics of the

16

tonsil epithelium, such as its cellular composition, histologic properties, and molecular

17

biological features. Notably, we verified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids with a

18

robust replication efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir, an antiviral agent,

19

effectively protected them from viral infection. Therefore, tonsil organoids could be available

20

for investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pathology and for preclinical screening

21

of novel antiviral drug candidates.

Introduction:

2

COVID-19 is rapidly spreading worldwide, resulting in over 14 million infected cases with

3

approximately 597 thousand death as of late July 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-

4

source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200719-covid-19-sitrep-181.pdf?sfvrsn=82352496_

2)(2020). SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through the upper respiratory tract with diverse

6

disease symptoms ranging from mild sickness (including fever, cough, sore throat, and loss of

7

olfaction or taste) to radical severity (pneumonia and even death)(Delgado-Roche and Mesta,

8

2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Thus, development of preventive

9

vaccines or therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Regarding this, a

10

suitable ex vivo model representing human infection cases in terms of host immune responses

11

as well as antiviral pathways is indispensable for preclinical validation of efficacy and toxicity.

12

The tonsils are two oval-shaped immunologic organs in the back of the oral cavity(Perry

13

and Whyte, 1998) (Figure S1A). They are histologically composed of mucosa-lining

14

epithelium and underlying parenchymal B or T cell lymphocytes(Perry and Whyte, 1998).

15

These cells filter diverse inhaled viruses, possibly including SARS-CoV-2(Nave et al., 2001;

16

Perry and Whyte, 1998). Thus, it was assumed that the tonsil could be one of the most suitable

17

and easily accessible organs for studying respiratory virus-mediated diseases, such as SARS-

18

CoV-2 infections. Currently, there are no substitutable model systems for exploring tonsillar

19

infectious diseases because of the difficulty in culturing its epithelial cells that can be stably

20

maintained over long-term serial passages(Kang et al., 2015). In addition, experimental small

21

animal models are inappropriate due to intrinsic lack of tonsils in mice or hamsters(Casteleyn

22

et al., 2011).

23

The tonsil epithelium is composed of differentiated epithelial cells, which reside in the top

layer of the epithelium and are generated by the differentiation of stem-like epithelial cells in

2

the bottom layer of the epithelium(Kang et al., 2015). This suggests that producing an organoid

3

model could be feasible, particularly given recent advances in long-term 3D culture of

4

epithelial stem cells from human specimens(Huch et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2009). These

5

epithelial organoids mimic the in vivo environment because they contain all tissue-specific

6

epithelial cell types and structures that differentiate and proliferate from epithelial stem

7

cells(Bartfeld et al., 2015; Clevers, 2016; Dutta et al., 2017; Huch et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2014;

8

Sato et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020). This method has been extensively used to generate

9

epithelial tissue-related disease models and study epithelial biology(Bartfeld et al., 2015;

10

Clevers, 2016; Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; van de Wetering et al., 2015).

11

Here, we aimed to establish tonsil-derived epithelial organoids with morphological and

12

molecular biological features similar to those of in vivo tonsils and to examine their availability

13

as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results:

2

Generation of human tonsil organoids from tonsil tissues

3

To generate epithelial organoids from human tonsils, enzymatically dissociated cells from

4

human tonsil tissue were embedded in Matrigel and grown in either human colon organoid

5

medium (HCM)(Drost et al., 2015) or human prostate organoid medium (HPM)(Karthaus et

6

al., 2014) containing epidermal growth factors, such as Noggin, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)

7

2, FGF10, and R-spondin-1, which play pivotal roles in differentiation and proliferation of

8

epithelial stem cells (Figure S1A and Table S1). Tonsil cells cultured in HPM yielded a higher

9

number of 3D epithelial organoids with a stratified epithelial structure within 10 days,

10

compared to the cells cultured in HCM (Figure S1B, C). To optimize the medium composition,

11

we screened the medium components. The largest organoids in the highest formation rate were

12

observed when dissociated tonsil cells were grown in the HPM in the absence of epidermal

13

growth factor, defined as the tonsil organoid formation medium (TfM) (Figure 1A, B and S1D-

14

F). However, we found that subculture of the tonsil organoids in TfM was limited within two

15

passages and further expansion was not available (Figure S1G). To solve this problem, we

16

additionally modified the TfM in which the p38 pathway is activated by removing SB202190

17

and adding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), defined as the human tonsil expanding medium

18

(TeM). In this medium, the organoids were successfully expanded beyond 60 days without

19

affecting the growth rate (Figure 1C, D and S1H, I).

20

Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a broad epithelial cell marker(Trzpis et al., 2007),

21

is expressed in the basal layer of the tonsil epithelium and has been reported to exist on the

22

outer surface of other organoids(Buzhor et al., 2011; Itoh, 2016; Jung et al., 2011; Kessler et

al., 2015). We examined whether the tonsil organoids originated from EpCAM+ cells by sorting

2

cells for culture. In contrast to EpCAM- cells, EpCAM+ ones efficiently formed organoids

3

(Figure 1E, F). These EpCAM+ organoids substantially exhibited structural similarity to the

4

tonsil organoids grown from unsorted cells as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for

5

NGFR, MUC1, and E-cadherin (Figure 1G) The result indicated that the majority of tonsil

6

organoids are differentiated from EpCAM+ epithelial cells.

7

To investigate which tonsil markers among ITGA6, NGFR, and CD44 are critical for organoid

8

maturation, cells were sorted again on the basis of expression level of the individual

9

markers(Kang et al., 2015)(Figure S2A). The efficiency of organoid formation was highest for

10

ITGA6+ cells, while no organoid formation was observed with ITGA6- cells (Figure 1H, I).

11

Organoids were successfully developed irrespective of NGFR or CD expression. Expectedly,

12

organoids derived from ITGA6+ cells reproduced the structural characteristics of the tonsil

13

epithelium (Figure 1J). These findings suggest that tonsil organoids are differentiated from

14

EpCAM+ and ITGA6+ cells.

15

16

The tonsil organoids recapitulate features of human tonsil tissues

17

Next, to determine whether the tonsil organoids recapitulated the skeletal properties as well

18

as architecture of biomarkers identifying the tonsil epithelium, cultured tonsil organoids and

19

human tonsil tissues were compared by histological analysis (Figure 2A,B and S2B).

20

Immunohistochemistry showed that maturation of the organoids is accomplished when the

21

highly ordered stratified epithelium constructed for 15 days as observed in the tonsil epithelium

22

(Figure 2B and S2B). These results were more clarified by immunofluorescence staining with

specific markers representing each layer. NGFR-, CD44-, and CK5-positive cells, located in

2

the basal layer of tonsil tissues, were observed on the outer side of organoids; MUC1- and

3

CK4-positive cells, in the mid-upper layer of tonsil tissues, were observed on the inner side of

4

organoids (Figure 2C and S2C). This suggests that the outer layer of the tonsil organoid was

5

similar to the basal layer of tonsil tissue, while its inner layer is composed of cells similar to

6

the upper layer of tonsil tissue. The proliferating cell marker Ki67 and the tonsil stem cell

7

marker NGFR were found at the outermost layer of the organoid, and BrdU-labeled cells

8

migrated towards the center of the organoids, confirming the inward direction of differentiation

9

(Figure 2D and S2D). Electron Microscopic images of the organoids revealed typical features

10

of stratified squamous epithelium and tonsil-specific elements, such as desmosomes,

11

keratohyalin granules, and tonofilaments(Howie, 1980) (Figure 2E). Analysis of the global

12

gene expression profiles of tonsil organoids at day 15 from 2 donors with a reference of tonsil

13

epithelium revealed that 14,483 genes (79.1%) were similarly expressed, but 3826 genes

14

(20.9%) were discriminatively expressed either in the tonsil epithelium (GEO accession no.

15

GSM69767)(Kang et al., 2015) or in the tonsil organoids (Figure 2F,G).

16

Tonsil epithelial cells are stimulated by microbial challenge to secrete CXC chemokines such

17

as CXCL1, which mobilize inflammatory cells(Sachse et al., 2005), contributing to the immune

18

system’s first line of defense against pathogens. To confirm that these responses occur in tonsil

19

organoids, we quantified the amount of secretory cytokines after treatment with

20

lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component from gram-negative bacteria that causes

21

strong immune responses. In LPS-challenged organoids, not only the expression of chemokine

22

ligand 1 (CXCL1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) increased at the mRNA level in cell lysates but also

23

secretion of their proteins was enhanced in the culture supernatant (Figure 2H and S3A). The

24

migration index of HL-60 cells was also upregulated significantly compared with the negative

control following treatment with conditioned medium derived from LPS-treated organoids,

2

indicating that LPS treatment of the tonsil organoids stimulated the secretion of chemo-

3

attractants (Figure 2I and S3B). These results are consistent with those obtained in tissue

4

samples from patients with tonsillitis(Sachse et al., 2005), suggesting that the tonsil organoids

5

recapitulate tonsil epithelial responses to infectious stimuli from bacteria.

6

7

Sustainable infection of human tonsil organoids with SARS-CoV-2

8

It has been reported that for attachment and infection of SARS-CoV-2, the expression of

9

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the host cells is essential(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Kuhn et al., 2004).

10

Thus, we explored whether they are expressed in tonsil organoids. Immunofluorescence

11

analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 visualized that their expression was highest in NGFR-

12

positive basal cells and it decreased as the cells differentiated into CK5- and Muc1-positive

13

cells (Figure 3A,B). Interestingly, in contrast to ACE2, TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increased

14

as the tonsil organoid matured (Figure 3C,D). Collectively, we assumed that the tonsil

15

organoids could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

16

To prove the hypothesis above, the tonsil organoids were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at

17

different titers (0.1 and 1 MOI), and viral amplification was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR

18

and TCID50 determination using the culture supernatants. RT-PCR exhibited a time-dependent

19

increase in viral RNA levels in both challenges, indicating that the tonsil organoids are infected

20

with SARS-CoV-2 and then release viral progeny through multi-round infections (Figure 3E).

21

However, viral RNA detection may have occurred because of infected-organoid lysate

22

contamination. Thus, the number of viral particles was further determined by infection of the

same supernatants into fresh Vero cells. Marked enhancement of viral titers at 72 h after the

2

lower titer challenge supported the existence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the culture

3

supernatant (Figure 3F). Decisively, the higher titer challenge resulted in abundant

4

accumulation of progeny virus at 24, 48, and 72 h increasingly. Next, based on the fact that the

5

sample collection for the COVID-19 diagnostic test is generally performed through the nasal

6

or oral mucosa swab, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 replication capacity in tonsil organoids

7

to that in nasal cavity mucosa-derived organoids from a same donor (Figure S4A,B). The data

8

from both RT-PCR and TCID50 determination showed that SARS-CoV-2 infects tonsil

9

organoids but not nasal cavity organoids (Figure 3G,H). Taken together it can be suggested that

10

SARS-CoV-2 infection and amplification occurs selectively in the tonsil organoids rather than

11

in the nasal cavity organoids. Finally, we examined whether the tonsil organoid model is

12

applicable to evaluation of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus-infected

13

organoids were treated with increasing concentrations of remdesivir, of which emergency use

14

has recently been authorized by the FDA for COVID-19 treatment. Notably, a dose-dependent

15

decrease in the viral RNA level was induced by remdesivir with remarkable inhibitory efficacy

16

at concentrations above 1 μM (Figure 3I). Supporting this finding, western blot analysis with

17

cell lysates from the cognate samples revealed inhibition of spike protein expression without

18

affecting host protein expression (Figure 3J). Collectively, tonsil organoids could be applied to

19

evaluation of the antiviral efficacy of small molecules before attempting their translation to

20

clinical trials, as the organoid reflects the physiological conditions of viral infection in humans.

To define which part of the tonsil organoids is targeted by SARS-CoV-2, we immunostained

2

the virus-infected tonsil organoids. The viral spike and dsRNA, a marker for RNA-dependent

3

RNA replication, were dominantly expressed in the basal layer of the tonsil organoids, whereas

4

marginal or little expression was observed the inner part of the organoids (Figure 4A,B). To

5

further verify whether this infection indeed can cause generation of progeny viral particles,

6

transmission electron microscopy was performed with SARS-CoV-2-infected organoids at 48

7

h post-infection. A high density of viral particles was observed at the outside side of the apical

8

membrane in basal layer cells of the infected-organoids but not in the mock-infected sample

9

(Figure 4C). These results strongly demonstrate that replication of SARS-CoV-2 in tonsil

10

organoids facilitates generation of progeny virions.

11

To analyze changes in gene expression induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in tonsil

12

organoids, we performed mRNA array analysis using a quantitative multiplex panel composed

13

of cytokine- and interferon response-related genes. We found that among the 252 genes tested

14

in the array, 79 genes were upregulated, whereas 48 genes were downregulated (fold change >

15

|2|). Particularly, transcription of the genes encoding OAS1, IL-6, CXCL8, FOS, IL21R and

16

BMP6 was rapidly enhanced by more than 10 folds within 3 h post-infection. Most of the genes

17

selected here have been reported previously to be over-produced uncontrollably in SARS-CoV-

18

2-infected patients as a consequence of “cytokine storm”. It is noteworthy that OAS1, involved

19

in the innate immune response to viral infection for RNA degradation, is prominently

20

stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 throughout the infection period for 72 h. These omics data stressed

21

that the tonsil organoids model reconstitutes highly orchestrated antiviral defense system by

22

restoring SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated host gene expression (Figure 4D,E and S5A-C).

In summary, human tonsil organoids fully recapitulate the important features of in vivo tonsil

2

organs; most notably, SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids and replicate vigorously, after

3

which viral particles are secreted, indicating that the entire life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 is

4

discernible using tonsil organoids. Most of all, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesvir was

5

validated in the tonsil organoid model. It demonstrated that the organoids can be used as a

6

preclinical drug screening tool for developing SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. To the best of our

7

knowledge, this is the first paper to show establishment of tonsil organoids and their feasibility

8

of a respiratory viral infection, representatively SARS-CoV-2. From a clinical perspective,

9

tonsils are an easily accessible intraoral organ for harvesting specimens for SARS-CoV-2

10

studies without great inconvenience to the patient, unlike kidney, liver, bronchus, or gut

11

samples which require invasive and aggressive procedures to obtain. Thus, tonsil organoids

12

may be a valuable ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 research.

Discussion:

2

The oropharynx, being located behind the oral cavity and beneath the nasopharynx, functions

3

in both the digestive and respiratory systems. Among the four subparts of the oropharynx, the

4

tonsils (named the palatine tonsils or the oropharyngeal tonsils) are composed of a large

5

population of immune cells and thus responsible for the front line of defense against bacteria

6

and viruses that invade the nasal or the oral cavity. Paradoxically, they also serve as a reservoir

7

for infection of diverse viruses including Epstein-Barr virus, adenoviruses, influenza A and B

8

viruses, herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus and even human papillomavirus (Brook,

9

1987; Chatterjee et al., 2019; Mellin et al., 2002). Recently, it has been reported that the two

10

major genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are expressed in the

11

squamous epithelium lining oropharyngeal tonsillar tissue (Hou et al., 2020). It motivated us

12

to explore if the tonsil tissue is susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the lack of

13

culture system of tonsillar epithelial cells hindered in-depth cytopathologic or virological

14

investigation with the ongoing pandemic virus. Fortunately, we accomplished establishment of

15

a reliable culture system of the human tonsil organoids, recapitulating the dominant features

16

observed in in vivo tonsil organs, such as stratified squamous epithelial layers, tonsillar

17

biomarker distributions, and reproducible gene expression (Figure 2). In addition,

18

differentiation from ITGA6+ cells identified their potential origin to be tissue-resident stem

19

cells. Most notably, the tonsil organoids, of which basal layer was occupied with ACE2 and

20

TMPRSS2 proteins, were efficiently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, it was verified

21

that this virus is vigorously amplified there through multi-round infections, resulting in

22

secretion of the progeny viral particles abundantly (Figure 3 and 4). Being supportive to a well-

23

known theory highlighting the key roles of an oral-lung aspiration axis for airways infectious

diseases, our finding addresses that the tonsils might be not only a putative reservoir but also

2

one of the major target organs for primary infection of SARS-CoV-2 before its diffusion to

3

distal intrapulmonary regions.

4

In actual clinical practice, the specimens are generally collected either by following the nasal

5

or oral route for the COVID-19 test, undesirably resulting in a false-negative rate of 20-

6

67%(Kucirka et al., 2020; Wiersinga et al., 2020). One of the methods to improve the diagnostic

7

accuracy could be to retrieve adequate amounts of viral samples from the correct and accessible

8

site where viral replication occurs actively. However, nasal sample collection from the

9

nasopharynx mucosa is not easy, as it is located deep inside the nasal cavity. A thrust with a

10

cotton swab could make the patients feel uncomfortable. Due to the unexposed nature of the

11

nasopharynx, collecting mucosa from the nasal cavity but not from the nasopharynx could

12

unwantedly happen. Even if viral particles reach the nasal mucosa, functional ciliary movement

13

of the epithelial surface promotes mucus flow physically clearing away the viral contaminants

14

from the nasal mucosa to the nasopharynx. Besides as seen our data with the nasal cavity

15

mucosa organoids, viral replication occurs poorly within the nasal cavity compared to the

16

tonsils. Therefore, it is recommended that specimen collection is performed from the tonsils

17

preferentially, as they are located at a relatively conspicuous site and adjustable for prolonged

18

SARS-CoV-2 replication. More importantly, this approach could alleviate the pain of the

19

patients.

20

Cytokine storm has been regarded as an initial cause for acute respiratory distress syndrome

21

(ARDS) and multi organ failures accounts for severe pneumonia, accounting for a significant

22

number of deaths among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. This hyperactive inflammatory

23

response is mainly related to abrupt release of pro-inflammatory or inflammatory mediators

such as IL-6, TNF-α and CXCL8 (also named IL-8) in COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020).

Beyond this observation, our gene expression profile in tonsil organoids additively signified

3

the elevated mRNA levels of FOS, IL-21R, BMP6, CSF2 and CXCL6 at an earlier point post-

4

infection, together with IFNAR1 and CXCL1 at a later point after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

5

Intriguingly, in accordance with published data from nasal goblet and ciliated cells in the

6

patients (Sungnak et al., 2020), expression of OAS1 mRNA was remarkably stimulated during

7

the whole infection period, indicating operation of aggressive tonsillar innate immune

8

responses for non-specific degradation of both viral and cellular RNAs. On the basis of the

9

immune network information acquired, we are going to investigate the time-course of single-

10

cell RNA-seq. transcriptome changes and the cytokines/chemokines secretion by co-culturing

11

the tonsil organoids in the presence of tonsillar lymphocytes to elucidate immunological

12

tripartite crosstalk between tonsil epithelial cells, lymphocytes and SARS-CoV-2. This

13

approach could provide scientific insights or knowledge for understanding of host defense

14

mechanism against the virus or of counteracting viral immune evasion strategies.

15

It should be emphasized that the therapeutic efficacy of remdesvir was validated in the tonsil

16

organoid model, implying its value as a preclinical drug screening tool for development of

17

SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. This system might have advantages as an alternative to animal

18

models particularly when they target host factors involved in the virus life cycle or immune

19

regulations. It is nontrivial because efficacy of those antivirals could be devaluated or not

20

assessable in animals due to low genetic homology or their null function. To the best of our

21

knowledge, this is the first paper to show generation of human tonsil organoids and their

22

feasibility of a respiratory viral infection, representatively SARS-CoV-2. From a clinical

23

perspective, tonsils are an easily accessible intraoral organ for harvesting specimens for SARS14

Materials and Methods:
Cell isolation and organoid formation from human tonsil tissue
This study was approved by the institutional review board of Konkuk University Hospital
(IRB-No.KUH1110073) and carried out with the written consent of all donors. Tonsils were
obtained from patients by tonsillectomy. When needed, both tonsil and nasal tissues were
collected from one patient via tonsillectomy and endoscopic nasal surgery, respectively, for the
co-treatments of tonsillitis and sinusitis. The samples were chopped and washed with D-PBS
(LB001-02, Welgene, Daegu, Korea) and then enzymatically digested with advanced
DMEM/F12 (11330-032, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 1 mg/mL collagenase II
(17101015, Gibco) for 2 h at 37°C. After digestion, isolated cells were embedded in Matrigel
(354230, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA), seeded into a 48-well plate (SPL, Inc., Gyeonggido, Korea) and incubated with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 10 min to polymerize the matrices. Tonsil
organoids were cultured in advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with Antibiotic-Antimycotic
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), Glutamax (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), B27 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 10% R-spondin1 conditioned media and the
following growth factors: 50 ng/mL recombinant murine HGF (315-23, Peprotech, Rocky Hill,
NJ, USA), 100 ng/mL noggin (cyt-600, ProSpec, St. Paul, MN, USA), 20 nM A83-01
(SML0788, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 50 ng/mL human FGF10 (ATGP1387, ATGen,
Seongnam, Korea), 20 ng/mL human bFGF (100-18B, Peprotech), 10 µM prostaglandin E2
(3632464, BioGems, Westlake Village, CA, USA), and 10 mM nicotinamide (N0636, Sigma).
Five nM Neuregulin1 (100-03, Peprotech) was added only to the nasal cavity mucosa derived
organoid tonsil cultures. After passaging, 10 µM Y-27632 (1254, Tocris Biosciences, Bristol,
UK) was added to the culture medium for 2 days.

Infection of tonsil organoids with SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020) was amplified in Vero CCL-81 cells
(American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) through three passages in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; HyClone, South Logan, UT, USA). Tonsil
organoids at passage 2 were differentiated from single cells for 5 days. After detaching the
organoids with 6 ´ 104 cells, they were suspended in 5 μL TeM and infected with the same
volume of SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 or 1 at 37℃ for 1 h. Unabsorbed virus was removed
by washing with 1 mL PBS twice after centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 s. Each sample of mockinfected or SARS-CoV-2-infected organoids was embedded into 20 μL Matrigel on a 48-well
plate and cultured in 300 μL TeM supplemented with 10 μM Y27632 at 37℃. The supernatants
were harvested at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection for viral RNA quantification and infectious
viral titration.

Viral RNA quantification and TCID50 determination
Viral RNA was purified from the culture supernatant at different time points using a Viral RNA
Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). One-step RT-PCR targeting the viral N gene was
performed using a diagnostic kit (PCL Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) and CFX96 Touch realtime PCR instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In all experimental sets, RNAs purified from
serial dilutions of a virus stock with identified plaque titers were used as a standard to quantify
the absolute viral RNA copy number in the samples. In parallel, Vero CCL-81 cells (ATCC)
were seeded at a density of 2 ´ 104 cells per well in 96-well plates, and then treated with serially
diluted culture supernatants from the SARS-CoV-2-infected organoids using the cell-cultured
3

SARS-CoV-2 stock at an MOI of 0.1 as a control. On day 2 post-infection, the cells were fixed
and permeabilized with chilled acetone: methanol (1:3) solution at room temperature for 10
min. Viral S protein was probed using anti-S antibody (Genetex, Irvine, CA, USA) and Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen), and cellular nuclei were
stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were captured
and analyzed using an Operetta High-content Screening System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,
USA) and quantified using the built-in Harmony software. Compared to the control infection
(100%), dilution folds resulting in 50% infection were calculated to determine the 50% tissue
culture infectious doses (TCID50).

Antiviral activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in tonsil organoids
Five-day cultured tonsil organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 and
embedded in 20 μL fresh TeM plus Matrigel (6 ´ 104 cells per well in 48-well plates) after
washing twice with PBS. Remdesivir (purity 99.84%; MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction,
NJ, USA) was 10-fold serially diluted in TeM from 10 to 0.1 μM to treat SARS-CoV-2-infected
organoids. On day 2, the culture supernatants were harvested to measure the amount of viral
RNA, in parallel cell lysates were collected from 4 wells to compare the expression level of
viral S protein. For western blot analysis, cell lysates were harvested using RIPA buffer (LPS
solution, Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The immuno-transferred membrane was probed with
primary anti-S antibody followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse
goat IgG (Invitrogen).

Clonal organoid formation assay from sorted cells by flow cytometry
To confirm the origin of cells forming the organoids, tonsil tissue was enzymatically digested
with advanced DMEM/F12 medium containing 600 µg/ml collagenase II and 250 µg/ml DNase
I (D5025, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours at 37°C. Dissociated cells were stained with anti-IgG
(130-113-196, Miltenyi Biotec), NGFR (sc-13577, Santa Cruz), CD44-FITC (555478, BD
biosciences), ITGA6-PE (12-0495-83, Biolegend), and EpCAM-APC (130-113-260, Miltenyi
Biotec), Alexa 488 (A32723, Invitrogen), and sorted using the MACS method. Sorted cells
were embedded in Matrigel and cultured in TeM (Full name) for 15 days.

Chemotaxis assay and cytokine array
To demonstrate the chemoattracts production of tonsil organoids, the chemotaxis assay was
performed. Briefly, HL-60 cells (10240, Korean Cell Line Bank) were differentiated into
granulocytes by adding 1.3% DMSO (D1370.0250, Duchefa) for 7 days, as previously
described49. And then, HK-60 cells monolayers grown on transwell membranes (3421, Corning)
at a density of 5x105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 (11875093, Gibco) medium containing 0.5%
BSA, were exposed to supernatants that were collected from LPS (10 µg/ml, L2630, Sigma)
treated organoids. After 1 hour, migrated HL-60 cells were counted using LUNATM Automated
Cell

Counter

(Biosystems).

The cytokine profile assay

was

performed

using

a Proteome Profiler Human Cytokine Array kit (ARY005B, R&D Systems). Briefly, culture
supernatants from LPS-treated and untreated tonsil organoids was collected and incubated with
the precoated Proteome Profiler array membrane at 2-8°C overnight. The array membrane was
washed and incubated with streptavidin-HRP buffer for 30 min. And then, membrane was
treated with Chemi Reagent Mix and dot densities were imaged on a LAS4000.

Microarray analysis
To analyze the genetic similarity between tonsil tissue and organoids, microarray was
performed according to the human microarray chip technical manual (Macrogen, Seoul).
Briefly, total RNA was extracted from tissue and organoids using MagListo™ 5M Cell Total
RNA Extraction Kit (K-3611, Bioneer) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality
control and gene expression profiling were performed at Macrogen. Gene expression data were
processed using Affymetrix Power Tools and R statistical software version 3.2.2.

qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from LPS-treated or SARS-CoV-2 infected organoids, and cDNA
synthesis was conducted using PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (RR036A, TaKaRa).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with a Thermal Cycler Dice® Real-Time System III
(Takara) using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II (RR820A, TaKaRa). The specific primer sets for
Antiviral Response (SH-0014), Chemokines and Receptors (SH-0035) and Interferons and
Receptors (SH-0092), which were purchased from Bioneer (AccuTarget™ Human qPCR
Screening Kit, Korea). Other primer sequences are listed in Table S2.

Histology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence
Tissues and organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, BP031, Bio-solution), and
embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of 5 µm in thickness were deparaffinized in xylene and
hydrated in a graded series of ethanol. These samples were then stained with H&E, Alcian blue
(AR16011-2, Agilent), PAS staining kit (ab150680, Abcam), and Masson’s trichrome staining
6

kit (QAR17392-2, Dako) according to their respective manufacturer’s protocol. For
immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate buffer (10 mM
sodium citrate with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6) at 95°C for 1 hour. Endogenous peroxidase was
blocked using 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min. After blocking with 1% BSA in PBS, sections
were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibody and then incubated with a biotinylated
secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG, Vectastain ABC kit, Vector) at room
temperature (RT) for 30 min. Sections were stained according to the avidin-biotin complex
method using Vectastain kit and visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
(Vectastain DAB kit, Vector). For immunofluorescence analysis, fixed samples were
cryoprotected by immersing in PBS containing 30% sucrose and 0.1% sodium azide at 4°C,
embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT, 4538, Sakura) compound, and rapidly frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections of 4 µm in thickness were pre-blocked with 5% normal
horse serum (S-2000, Vector) in PBS at RT for 2 hours and incubated with primary antibody at
4°C overnight. And then, sections were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 hours at RT.
Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/ml, B2261, Sigma). The acquisition of
confocal images was performed by Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscopy. All antibodies used
in this study are listed in Table S3.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
To observe the SARS-CoV-2 infection into tonsil organoid, transmission electron microscope
(TEM) analysis was performed. Briefly, tonsil organoids were fixed in Karnovsky’s fixative
(2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% CaCl2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4),
and embedded in the epoxy resin after post-fixation with 1% OsO4 dissolved in 0.1 M
7

phosphate buffer. Ultrathin sections were processed using an ultramicrotome (EM-UC-7,
LEICA) and placed on a copper grid stained with 6% uranyl and lead citrate. The samples were
observed using a JEM-1011 (JEOL).

Statistical analysis
Statistically significant differences were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software package,
version 3.0 (GraphPad Prism). Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to compare two groups
and one-way ANOVA with post-test Tukey multiple comparisons tests were used to compare
multiple groups. Significance was considered at p < 0.05. Sample sizes for experiments were
estimated using NIS imaging software. All results are presented as the mean ± SEM.
