Abstract

28

A comprehensive analysis and characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 infection model that mimics

29

non-severe and severe COVID-19 in humans is warranted for understating the virus and

30

developing preventive and therapeutic agents. Here, we characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse

31

model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter,

32

in epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2 infections typically start. We

33

found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2×103 and 2×104 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2

34

caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lungs, liver, and

35

kidney, while lower doses (2×101 and 2×102 PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some

36

mice recovered from the infection. In this humanized hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2

37

infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage

38

was observed in biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered after

39

infection with a low dose of virus also survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared

40

to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19

41

model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include

42

analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human biopsy

43

samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates

44

both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans and can provide insight into disease

45

progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19.

Importance

48

The pandemic of COVID-19 has reached 112,589,814 cases and caused 2,493,795 deaths

49

worldwide as of February 23, 2021, has raised an urgent need for development of novel drugs

50

and therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this goal,

51

an animal model that recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and

52

pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse

53

model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice with

54

low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 virus to study the pathogenesis and survival in response to

55

different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2

56

transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that this model could be a useful

57

tool for the development of anti-viral drugs and therapeutics.

Introduction

61

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the extremely

62

contagious RNA coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 112,589,814 cases and 2,493,795 deaths

63

worldwide as of February 23, 2021 (1). The median time to development of symptoms is 5.1

64

days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (2). The median time from onset to clinical recovery for

65

mild cases is approximately 2 weeks, with 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or advanced

66

disease (3). The main symptoms, such as fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty

67

breathing, and sore throat normally ease after recovery; however, 3-17% patients, especially the

68

elderly and individuals with cancer and diabetes, develop rapid viral replication and severe lung

69

damage, resulting in severe disease with greatly increased risk of death (4). Many groups are

70

trying to understand this rapid disease progression and studies suggest that it may involve an

71

impaired immune response (5-7). A mouse model that appropriately mirrors progression of the

72

human disease should help the development of vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19 and could

73

be used as a conceptual basis for rapid response to future viral pandemics.

75

During infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein promotes SARS-

76

CoV-2 entry into host cells via the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(8).

77

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, which were originally developed to study the infection of SARS-

78

CoV, express human ACE2, the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into cells (9). The

79

human keratin 18 (K18) promoter is responsible for directing expression to airway epithelial

80

cells, where respiratory infections usually begin. Recent research reported this SARS-CoV-2

81

hACE2 mouse infection model develops severe interstitial pneumonia with high viral loads into

82

the lungs and immune cell infiltration into the alveoli (10-13). A comprehensive analysis and

83

characterization of this model will be useful for studying the mechanisms of pathogenesis by

84

SARS-CoV-2 and developing preventive, therapeutic, and vaccinal agents.

85
86

In the current study, we evaluate K18-hACE2 transgenic mice in response to multiple infectious

87

doses, using multiple tissues, to gain a complete understanding of the response to the infectious

88

dose. We also evaluated the response of K18-hACE2 mice to high-dose re-infection after

89

recovery from low-dose infection.

Results

92
93

The K18-hACE2 model is a lethal infection model for SARS-CoV-2 infection

94

To understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 viral dosage on pathogenesis and survival, we

95

established an infection model using the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, in which human

96

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) expression is driven by the epithelial cell-specific

97

promoter K18 in C57BL/6 mice(9). The mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 2 ×101 PFU

98

(low dose), 2 ×102 PFU (low dose), 2 ×103 PFU (high dose), 2 ×104 PFU (high dose) or PBS

99

vehicle control via intranasal inoculation. Blood was collected at day 3 post infection (p.i.) then

100

the mice were euthanized, and viral loads and pathology were examined at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 1A).

101

We found that mouse body weight decreased in mice infected with 2 ×103 PFU and 2 ×104 PFU

102

by day 4 p.i, whereas mice infected with 2 ×101 PFU and 2 ×102 PFU showed a less dramatic

103

body weight decrease; a body weight decrease of 20% occurred at days 5–6 in the higher-dose

104

groups, but took until day 10–11 for 80% of the mice in the low-dose groups (Fig. 1B). 30% of

105

the mice from the lower-dose groups even started to gain weight again at day 4 (for 2×101) and

106

day 8 (for 2×102) (Fig. 1B), indicating a recovery from the viral infection in low-dose groups.

107

Consistent with body weight data, 90% of the mice infected with 2 ×103 PFU or 2 ×104 PFU died

108

at approximately at day 7, whereas 50% of the mice infected with 2 ×101 PFU or 2 ×102 PFU

109

died approximately at day 10 (Fig. 1C). Three mice infected with 2 ×101 PFU or 2 ×102 PFU,

110

and none infected with 2 ×103 PFU or 2 ×104 PFU, recovered and survived until the end of

111

follow-up on day 20 p.i. (Fig.1C).

113

Expression distribution of viral genes in the tissues of K18-hACE2 mice infected with high

114

or low doses of SARS-CoV-2

115

To further investigate the viral infection pattern, we used reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR to

116

measure viral spike protein RNA levels in the brain, trachea, lung, liver, spleen, small intestine,

117

stomach, large intestine, kidney, and testis. The mean viral loads in all three higher dose groups

118

were over PBS and 1 × 102, except for 2 ×101 PFU in the spleen, and no virus was detected in

119

uninfected controls (Fig. 2A). We observed three types of dose-response relationships. In trachea,

120

lung, stomach, and kidney, there was a stepwise dose-response relationship. In heart, liver, spleen,

121

and small intestine, the observed a plateau, with the 3 higher dose groups having similar viral

122

loads. In brain, large intestine, and testis, mice infected with 2 ×101 PFU or 2 ×102 PFU had

123

similar viral loads and mice infected with 2 ×103 PFU or 2 ×104 PFU had much higher viral

124

loads. This indicates that there are tissue-specific factors modulating the effect of dose on viral

125

copy number. The viral RNA levels were high in the lungs of animals in all dose groups (Fig.

126

2A), consistent with the notion the lung is an important site of infection, especially at lower viral

127

doses. The viral RNA levels were also very high in brain for mice infected with 2 ×103 PFU or 2

128

×104 PFU. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure expression of SARS-CoV-2

129

nucleocapsid protein (NP) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, which

130

confirmed the infection pattern in the lungs and brains of the K18-hACE2 mice infected with a

131

series of increasing viral doses, demonstrating that viral spread in tissues was also dose-

132

dependent (Fig. 2B).

133
134

To evaluate the lung cell types that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed IHC

135

on samples from mice infected with 2 × 104 PFU. We double stained lung sections for viral NP

136

and CCL10, which is the marker of club (clara) cells, or SPC, the marker of alveolar type 2 cells,

137

respectively. We found that only few club cells or alveolar type 2 cells co-localized with NP,

138

suggesting they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3A). Macrophages are a major

139

immune cell population in lung, where they act as a first-line defense against invading pathogens.

140

We therefore used the CD68 as a macrophage marker to examine if SARS-CoV-2 could infect

141

tissue resident macrophages in lung. We noticed that that CD68 positive cells increased

142

dramatically in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, although very few macrophages stained

143

positive for NP, suggesting that it could be possible for SARS-CoV-2 to suppress immune

144

response via infection of lung macrophages (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the finding in the K18-

145

hACE2 mouse model, in biopsy lung samples from COVID-19 patients, few viral spike protein

146

is colocalized with alveolar type 2 cells and CD68-positive cells (Fig. 3B). These results are in

147

line with another SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model that uses CRISPR/Cas9 knockin of

148

hACE2 into Exon 2 of the mAce2 gene, as well as COVID-19 patient samples, which show

149

SARS-CoV-2 in macrophages of pulmonary alveolus (12, 14). Given the high levels of SARS-

150

CoV-2 in brain, we examined whether neurons are infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found strong

151

overlap between staining for the neuronal marker Neu and staining for NP (Fig. 3A). Human

152

lung alveolar type II cells were injured significantly by COV19 virus infection. This was

153

identified by the reduction of the number and stain intensity of SPC positive cells (yellow) in

154

infected lung compared to no-infected lung. In COVID-19 lung sample #1, which has highest

155

virus amount (teal), the SPC positive cells are almost completely lost, whereas in the other lungs,

156

SPC positive cells are low and fallen off from epithelium into alveolar lumen; meanwhile,

157

Consistent with findings in mouse COV19 model, in human lung, very few CD68 positive

158

macrophages (yellow) are also positive for Spike (teal). Our results indicated that the K18-

159

hACE2 mice could be a suitable model for mimicking the infections of the COVID-19 patients.

160
161

Pathology of tissues of K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2

162

To assess disease severity, we used H&E staining to assess pathology in multiple FFPE tissues

163

from K18-hACE2 mice infected with a series of increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2. As expected,

164

lung tissues showed the most severe damage. Mice in the low-dose groups showed an average of

165

30–60% more alveolar congestion and consolidation compared to uninfected mice (Fig. 4A).

166

Some lung tissue showed alveolar hemorrhage as well as lymphocytic pneumonitis with alveolar

167

thickening and peripheral parenchymal collapse. Lung damage in the high-dose groups were

168

even more extensive, consisting of ~20% alveolar collapse with ruptured septa, as well as

169

thickened alveolar septa and intra-alveolar. Parenchymal consolidation was evident in 50% of the

170

tissue, along with interstitial inflammation and pneumonitis (Fig. 4A). Similarly, trachea tissues

171

showed mild epithelial damage in the lower-dose groups and more severe epithelial damage in

172

the higher-dose groups. Consistent with the brain showing high viral gene expression for the

173

higher-doses groups (Fig. 2A), brain tissues showed mild congestion in some mice from the low-

174

dose groups, with more extensive congestion in the high-dose groups. In liver tissue, the low-

175

dose groups showed several foci of spotty and patchy necrosis (focal perivenular), Kupffer cell

176

hyperplasia, and focal portal inflammation; the high-dose groups also showed Kupffer cell

177

hyperplasia along with congestion, reactive change, apoptotic hepatocytes, and focal lobular

178

inflammation (Fig. 4A). In spleen, the low dose group showed red pulp congestion while the

179

high dose group also showed lymphoid hyperplasia and mild extramedullary hematopoiesis. The

180

stomach and small and large intestines in the low-dose groups appeared normal but the stomach

181

showed reactive changes, diffuse epithelial sloughing and chronic inflammation along the

182

myenteric plexus, while the small and large intestine showed myenteric plexus inflammation.

183

The testis in the low dose group also appeared normal but showed focal tubular damage and

184

congestion in the high dose group. In kidney, both the low dose and high dose group showed

185

cortical congestion, tubular damage and focal tubular collapse. Meanwhile, both low dose and

186

high dose group showed ischemic change and disarray in heart (Fig. 4A). These findings indicate

187

that SARS-CoV-2 infection damages multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most

188

tissues.

189
190

To compare the pathology in the mouse model to COVID-19 patients, we also examined the

191

pathology in autopsy samples of COVID-19 patients. We identified congestion and inflammation

192

in multiple organs, as well as the epithelial damage and necrosis, which was consistent with our

193

findings in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mouse model (Fig. 4B).

195

Expression of hACE2 in K18-hACE2 mice and human tissues

196

To better understand the infection pattern and virus distribution in this mouse model, we

197

measured hACE2 RNA expression levels in various tissues of hACE2 mice by RT-PCR. We

198

found that, compared to the expression of hACE2 in lung tissue, there was also high expression

199

in brain, trachea, heart, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, kidney, and testis; whereas there

200

was lower expression in the liver and spleen (Fig. 5A). We also confirmed the hACE2 expression

201

in brain, trachea, lung and kidney of the k18-hACE2 mice at the protein level by IHC (Fig. 5B).

202

The expression of hACE2 in these three tissues in humans is consistent with the finding that they

203

had the highest viral load, further confirming the K18-hACE2 mouse is a good model for

204

studying in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also examined hACE2 expression in a human tissue

205

array. We found that hACE2 is not only highly expressed in lung but also in stomach, small and

206

large intestine, kidney and testis. However, the expression of ACE2 in human brain was not as

207

high as in the brain of K18-hACE2 mice; this could be due to the insertion of the K18 promotor,

208

which confers higher expression of hACE2 in the mouse model (Fig. 5C). This finding is

209

consistent with another transgene driven by a human K18 regulatory element in mice(15).

211

Protective role of serum from previously infected mice and the mice with previous low-dose

212

of virus infection against rechallenge with high-dose of virus infection in K18-hACE2 mice

213
214

To evaluate if the serum from infected mice could protect the mice from viral infection, we

215

injected virus-naïve mice with serum from mice infected with 2 × 104 PFU group of mice and

216

then infected the virus-naïve mice with SARS-COV2 at 2 × 104 PFU/mouse. The body weights

217

of treated vs. control mice were continuously monitored. We found that the mice treated with

218

serum from infected mice showed a delayed and slower body weight drop compared to the

219

untreated group (Fig. 6A), suggesting the serum from infected mice could have a protective

220

effect on newly infected mice. Serum from infected mice did not significantly protect but show

221

but show a trend against death after virus rechallenge, which might be due to a little amount of

222

serum that we can collected to have enough sample size (Fig. 6B).

223
224

In addition, we rechallenged the mice that survived 2 × 101 or 2 × 102 PFU infection with 2 × 104

225

PFU virus when they recovered to the initial body weight. We found that all mice survived the

226

high-dose virus re-challenge and did not show substantial body weight drop, suggesting that

227

recovery from low-dose infection conferred anti-viral activity that protected against rechallenge

228

with high dose virus (Fig. 6B).

229
230

Discussion

231

The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that has claimed the lives of nearly 2,500,000 people has

232

led to an urgent need for a mouse infection model that accurately mirrors inoculation,

233

development and progression of the human disease termed COVID-19. The K18-hACE2 model

234

was developed to study coronavirus infection (9).In the current study, we performed a

235

comprehensive analysis of viral load and tissue pathology based on a range of inoculation doses

236

and compared the results to observations in biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. We found

237

a dose-response relationship between infectious dose and loss of body weight, viral titer, tissue

238

pathology and mortality. Notably, there was not a uniform relationship between infectious dose

239

and viral titer, with some tissues accumulating virus at lower doses and others accumulating

240

virus at higher doses. We evaluated hACE2 levels in the K18-ACE2 mice and found similarity to

241

ACE2 levels in humans. We also showed that challenge with a low dose of SARS-CoV-2

242

protected against the lethality of rechallenge with a higher dose. Overall, our results indicate that

243

low dose infection in the K18-hACE2 model mimics non-severe COVID-19, while infection

244

with higher doses mimics severe COVID-19.

245
246

Due to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many models of human COVID-

247

19 are under investigation. In addition to the K18-hACE2 model, other mouse models have been

248

described. Hassan et al. used replication-defective adenoviruses encoding human ACE2-

249

tranduced mice to infect BALB/c mice, followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection, to model COVID-

250

19 (13). Following infection by 105 focus-forming units (FFU) of SARS-CoV-2, the body weight

251

of mice was maintained but did not drop, therefore it seems that the model is not a lethal model.

252

Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock-in hACE2, Sun et al. established a model (12). In

253

response to 4×105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2, the animals experienced robust viral replication in

254

multiple tissues and interstitial pneumonia, but no obvious clinical symptoms or mortality; only

255

10% of aged mice lost their weight at day 3 p.i. and recovered. With the low incidence rate and

256

very mild symptoms, this model is not ideal to recapitulate human COVID-19. This might be due

257

to the nature of the knock-in with only one copy of hACE2 systemically existing in mice. Qin

258

and colleagues developed a hACE2 transgenic mouse model with a mouse ACE2 promoter for

259

SARS and used the model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection (11, 16). Infected by 105 TCID50 of

260

SARS-CoV-2, the mouse body weights dropped at day 1 and continued until day 5, and then

261

almost completely recovered on day 14 without lethality, suggesting that this model at least does

262

not mimic severe COVID-19 patients. This might be due to lower promoter activity or gene

263

expression of murine (m)ACE2 compared to the K18 promoter (16). Ostrowski et al. developed

264

transgenic mice using the promoter of the human FOXJ1, a transcription factor required for

265

differentiation of ciliated epithelial cells in the airway, to drive hACE2 expression (17). Jiang

266

and colleagues used this model to study SARS-CoV-2 (10). Infected with 3×104 PFU virus,

267

among 10 mice, 2 had no infection, 4 had no drop in body weight, and 4 had body weight drops

268

with 3 deaths and 1 recovery (10). In contrast, for the K18-hACE2 model that we characterized

269

here, with the dose of 2×103 PFU, which is lower than the doses used in all above mouse models,

270

all mice succumbed to infection with body weight drops and mortality of 100% by day 8. With

271

lower dose infection such as 2×101 and 2×102 PFU, 30% of the mice recovered. Collectively,

272

these suggest that the K18-hACE2 model is the most sensitive model for COVID-19, with ability

273

to recapitulate aspects of human disease from both non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients.

274

Our results are supported by those from other groups (18-22).This might be due to unique

275

aspects of the K18-hACE2 model: 1) hACE2 is used, where in contrast other models including

276

golden hamster, ferret, cat, Chinese tree shrew and even mouse models with an endogenous

277

ACE2 promoter recapitulate human expression levels (23). 2) Multiple copies of hACE2 are

278

placed in the murine genome, where as one copy of hACE2 may not be ideal, evidenced by the

279

knock-in study by Sun et al (12); and 3) human K18 is likely stronger than the promoters in other

280

models, such as the human FOXJ1 in the study by Jiang et al. (10)

281
282

The pathological damage in lung and brain in the K18-hACE2 mouse infection model are similar

283

to the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients, suggesting this mouse model can recapitulate

284

SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. However, the K18-hACE2 mouse model was originally

285

generated by inserting hACE2 in the mouse genome under the human K18 promoter, which may

286

not result in the exact distribution of ACE2 expression as in humans. In fact, we observed high

287

expression levels of hACE2 in mouse brains, correlating with a higher virus titer in the brain

288

compared to most other organs or tissues; however, in biopsy samples of humans, the hACE2

289

expression is very low. Nonetheless, brain infections with COVID-19 and deaths of patients

290

from brain-specific COVID infection have been frequently reported (24-26). Interestingly, our

291

study showed that SARS-CoV-2 can infect neurons in an animal model, which is consistent with

292

previous studies using human neuron organoids (27-29). It will be interesting to know whether

293

this neuronal infection causes taste and smell loss, commonly found in patients with COVID-19,

294

as neuronal circuits respond to gustatory and olfactory cues (30).

295
296

In summary, we characterized the K18-hACE2 model for COVID-19 in comparison to human

297

biopsy samples. The model shows dose-dependent sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

298

Infection with low doses recapitulates the disease observed in non-severe COVID-19 patients,

299

while infection with higher doses recapitulates the disease observed in patients with severe

300

COVID-19. The K18-hACE2 humanized COVID-19 mouse model is excellent to study COVID-

301

19 and develop preventive and therapeutic drugs, as well as vaccines, for coronavirus diseases.

Viruses, cells and mice

312

The SARS-COV-2 strain used in the mouse model was SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-CDC-

313

WA1/2020, which was purchased from EBI. The viruses were amplified using Vero-E6 cells

314

(ATCC). Vero-E6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) plus

315

10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37

316

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and cultured for 96 h. Then the supernatant was

317

collected and titrated using a plaque assay.

were observed and weighed daily. Blood was collected on day 6 from high dose groups and used

327

for serum protection experiments. The mice were euthanized at day 6 post infection and the

328

tissues were collected for further analysis.

329
330

Viral rechallenge model

331

The mice that survived i.n. infection with 2 × 101 PFU and 2 × 102 PFU of virus were

332

rechallenged two weeks after the initial infection with 2 × 104 PFU virus i.n. when they

333

recovered to the initial body weight after the first infection. The body weight was continuously

334

monitored.

335
336

Serum protection model

337

The serum of the mice infected by 2 × 104 PFU virus was collected at day 6 post infection. Half

338

of the serum was intraperitoneally injected into the non-infected mice 2 days before the mice

339

were i.n. infected with 2 × 104 PFU virus. The other half of the serum was i.n. administered right

340

before the infection.

341
342

Viral titer detection

343

The tissues were collected, weighed and immediately homogenized using an electric

344

homogenizer (Thomas Scientific). After centrifugation at 1200g for 10 min, the supernatant was

345

isolated and used for viral titer detection.

346

(Invitrogen). A one-step RT-PCR kit (BioRad) was used to detect the viral RNA using Applied

350

Biosystems QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System with the following cycling protocol:

351

reverse transcription at 50°C for 10 minutes; hot start at 95°C for 10 minutes; and 40 cycles of

352

denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds and annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds. The primer sequences

353

were CoV2-S_19F (5’ -GCTGAACATGTCAACAACTC- 3’) and CoV2-S_143R (5’ -

354

GCAATGATGGATTGACTAGC- 3’), which were designed to target a 125 bp region of the

355

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (31). The standard samples were serial 10-fold dilutions of a known

356

copy number of the HKU1 virus. The results were normalized and expressed as genome

357

equivalent copies per gram of tissue.

358
359

Human ACE2 RNA quantification

360

Total RNA from the indicated tissues of the K18-hACE2 mice was isolated using the

361

PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript Reverse

362

Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). Human ACE2 expression was examined using the following

363

primers: F: CGAAGCCGAAGACCTGTTCTA; R: GGGCAAGTGTGGACTGTTCC, under the

364

following PCR conditions: 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 30 s

365

and 72 °C for 60 s.

379

and antigen retrieval were first performed. For single IHC stain, the primary antibodies were

380

incubated with DISCOVERY anti-Rabbit HQ following by DISCOVERY anti-HQ-HRP

381

incubation. For double IHC stain, two antigens were sequentially detected and heat inactivation

382

was used to prevent antibody cross-reactivity between the same species. Following each primary

383

antibody incubation, DISCOVERY anti-Rabbit HQ or NP or DISCOVERY anti-Mouse HQ or

384

NP and DISCOVERY anti-HQ-HRP or anti-NP-AP were incubated. The stains were visualized
