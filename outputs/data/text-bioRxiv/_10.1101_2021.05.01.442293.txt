ACE2 is present in astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelia of the blood brain barrier.
Neuronal ACE2 expression is shown in discrete nuclei through the brain.
Brainstem breathing, arousal-related, hypothalamic and limbic nuclei express ACE2.
ACE2 is expressed in circuits potentially involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology.

Abstract
We examined cell type-specific expression and distribution of rat brain angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in rodent brain. ACE2 is ubiquitously present in brain
vasculature, with the highest density of ACE2 expressing capillaries found in the olfactory bulb, the
hypothalamic paraventricular, supraoptic and mammillary nuclei, the midbrain substantia nigra and
ventral tegmental area, and the hindbrain pontine nucleus, pre-Bötzinger complex, and nucleus of
tractus solitarius. ACE2 was expressed in astrocytes and astrocytic foot processes, pericytes and
endothelial cells, key components of the blood-brain-barrier. We found discrete neuronal groups
immunopositive for ACE2 in brainstem respiratory rhythm generating centers including the pontine
nucleus, the parafascicular/retrotrapezoid nucleus, the parabrachial nucleus, the Bötzinger and preBötzinger complex and the nucleus of tractus solitarius; in arousal-related pontine reticular nucleus
and in gigantocellular reticular nuclei; in brainstem aminergic nuclei, including substantia nigra,
ventral tegmental area, dorsal raphe, and locus coeruleus; in the epithalamic habenula, hypothalamic
paraventricular and suprammamillary nuclei; and in the hippocampus. Identification of ACE2expressing neurons in rat brain within well-established functional circuits facilitates prediction of
possible neurological manifestations of brain ACE2 dysregulation during and after COVID-19
infection.

Introduction
The angiotensin converting enzyme ACE2 (EC 3.4.15.1), is a metalloproteinase that was
discovered in 2000 by two independent groups (Donoghue, Hsieh et al. 2000, Tipnis, Hooper et
al. 2000). Since then, it has been characterized as a counterregulatory component for the classical
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), responsible for cleaving angiotensins I and II to
peptides (angiotensin (1-9) and (1-7)) whose effects oppose the vasoconstrictor/proinflammatory
actions of angiotensins generated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (Rice, Thomas et al.
2004) (Zhang, Zetter et al. 2021). Moreover, the ability of ACE2 to hydrolyze other peptides such
as apelin, kinins, (des-Arg9)-bradykinin, neurotensin and dynorphin A-(1-13) (Vickers, Hales et
al. 2002) provide additional complexity to the role(s) of ACE2 in RAAS counter-regulation, and
association with various disease pathologies.
SARS‐CoV‐2, the pathogen of the current COVID-19 pandemic, is associated with the
RAAS (Zhang, Zetter et al. 2021). The virus uses ACE2 as a receptor to invade cells by binding
to it via the viral trimeric spike protein (Yan, Zhang et al. 2020). The spike protein is primed by
the serine protease TMPRSS2, triggering the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and
internalization of both virus and receptor in the first step of cellular infection (Zhang, Penninger
et al. 2020).
The acute and chronic neurological manifestations of COVID-19, such as headache,
dizziness, loss or disruption of the sense of smell (anosmia/dysosmia), taste (ageusia/dysgeusia),
loss of muscular coordination (ataxia), loss of autonomic respiratory control, lethargy, depression
and anxiety (Kabbani and Olds 2020, Mao, Jin et al. 2020, Satarker and Nampoothiri 2020, Haidar,
Jourdi et al. 2021, Nagu, Parashar et al. 2021, Stefano, Ptacek et al. 2021), as well as its potential
contribution to long-term adverse cerebrovascular, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative
pathologies (Cohen, Eichel et al. 2020, Ding, Shults et al. 2020, Nagu, Parashar et al. 2021,
Rahman, Islam et al. 2021) (Sashindranath and Nandurkar 2021) are still poorly understood. Thus,
there is an urgent need to determine brain ACE2 expression at the cellular and regional levels and
to analyze its potential participation in defined functional circuits associated with the neurological
manifestations of COVID-19.
Here, we examined cell type-specific expression, and regional distribution of ACE2 in
rodent brain. We used immunohistochemistry to characterize the pattern of ACE2 expression in
vascular, glial, and neuronal elements, participants of several well-defined circuits for respiratory
rhythm, arousal, reward, homeostasis, learning and memory. We analyze and discuss the possible
consequences of the disruption of these circuits in contributing to COVID-19 CNS disease.

Material and methods
Animals and brain section preparation
Four male Wistar rats from the local animal breeding facility were used in the present study.
Animals were housed with two other littermates, with food and water ad libitum, temperature
maintained between 20°C and 25°C, artificial illumination established to light-on at 8:00 hrs. and
light-off at 20 hrs. and bedding changed three times per week. For immunohistochemistry, rats
were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital 63 mg/kg; when eyelid reflex was abolished, the
animals were perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(PB, pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 15% v/v of a saturated picric acid solution. The
brains were quickly removed and thoroughly washed with PB. Sagittal 70 µm sections through the
whole mediolateral span were obtained with a vibratome (Leica VT1000S, Germany). All animals
were handled according to the guidelines and requirements of the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition), and the Mexican Official Norm
for Use, Care and Reproduction of Laboratory Animals (NOM-062-ZOO-1999). Experimental
protocols were reviewed and approved by the local Research and Ethics Committee (CIEFM-0622016).
Immunohistochemistry
For immunoperoxidase staining for ACE2, sagittal serial sections (at intervals of 140 µm) were
selected from two rats. Sections were first blocked against unspecific labeling through incubation
in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 0.05 M Trizma buffer, with 0.9% NaCl and 0.3% Triton
X-100 (TBST), at room temperature (RT) for two hours. Primary antibody rabbit anti-ACE2
(ab15348, 1:1000, Abcam, MA, USA, see also table 1 for antibody information) was used, diluted
in TBST + 1% NDS during 48h at 4°C with gentle shaking. After being washed with TBST,
sections were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson
Immunoresearch, 711-035-152, PA, USA) for 2 hrs. at RT. Sections were washed with 0.1 M PB
and immunoreaction was chromogenically developed using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (SigmaAldrich, D5637, MO, USA) and H2O2 as substrates. Negative control sections were processed
without adding the primary antibody. Finally, slices were mounted on glass slides, dehydrated
with ethanol, transferred to xylene and cover-slipped using Permount mounting medium. (Fischer
Chemical, SP15-100, MA, USA).
For multi-channel immunofluorescence staining, sections adjacent to those processed for
chromogenic reaction were selected and incubated with 10 % normal donkey serum in TBST for
two hr. at RT. After this blocking step, sections were incubated during 48hr at 4°C with cocktails
of primary antibodies against ACE2 and combinations of the following markers: calretinin (CR, a
calcium binding protein with a high expression in several nuclei of the brainstem and in the
olfactory bulb); the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2, a marker of glycinergic neurons, highly
expressed in the pontomedullary region of the brain); tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker for

catecholaminergic neurons), tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH, a marker for serotoninergic neurons);
AVP-neurophysin (a marker for vasopressinergic neurons); neuron-specific nuclear protein
(NeuN, a pan-neuronal marker); Von Willebrand Factor (VWF, a marker for endothelial cells) and
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker for astrocytes). See Table 1 for details about the
antibodies used in this study. After primary antibody incubation, the sections were washed three
times in TBST and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (see table 1). Finally,
sections were washed thoroughly in TBS and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield antifade
mounting medium (Vector, H1000, CA, USA). The DAB developed slices were observed with an
Olympus CX31 light microscope. Panoramic reconstructions of chromogenic developed sections
were obtained with a Zeiss AxioZoom V.16 microscope. Fluorescent images were obtained using
a Zeiss confocal LSM 880.

Quantification of ACE2 expression by optical intensity measurement in immunofluorescence
photomicrographs
Using the whole-brain digitally scanned images of the chromogenically developed slides, we
identified regions of high vascularization. A confocal fluorescence image was obtained from
similar regions in the adjacent sections that were processed for immunofluorescence. Laser
intensity, Airy disk diameter, detector gain, offset and exposure time parameters were fixed
between photomicrographs. Images were obtained in an 8bit format, thus the possible values for
each pixel ranged from “0” (no light) to “255” (maximum possible value). To calculate the optical
intensity (O.I.) from the light emitted at a determined region of interest (ROI), the average O.I. of
the pixels in a square 2500 µm2 area within the ROI was calculated in the program ZEN lite 3.1
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany). The average O.I. value of the background was
calculated from five regions where there was no tissue, thus only obtaining the value from the
glass slide and mounting medium, this background value was subtracted from the value obtained
in the ROIs. Finally, O.I. values were standardized, assigning a value of 10 relative fluorescence
intensity units to the main olfactory bulb (the region with the highest measured O.I.).

Results
General expression pattern of ACE2

The initial evaluation of ACE2 immunoreactivity through the rat brain was performed in
peroxidase-DAB developed slices (figure 1). High expression of ACE2 was observed in capillaries
throughout the brain, with the highest expression in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb
(MOBgl). Other regions with a high density of ACE2 expressing vessels were the supraoptic
(SON), paraventricular (PVN) and mammillary (MM) nuclei of the hypothalamus; the lateral
habenula (LHb) in the epithalamus; the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA)
in the mesencephalon; and the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS), gigantocellular reticular nucleus
(GRN), pontine nucleus (PN), pontine reticular nucleus (PRN), pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC)
and Bötzinger complex within the pontomedullary region. ACE2 expression was quantified by
measurement of the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) in photomicrographs obtained from
adjacent slices from the regions shown and processed for ACE immunofluorescence (Table 2).

ACE2 expression in identified cells of the blood-brain barrier
Through GFAP immunoreaction and confocal microcopy assessment, we determined the
expression of ACE2 in astrocytes throughout the brain. Some of those immunopositive cells were
found extending their end-feet processes to surrounding blood vessels (Fig. 2A) or in close contact

with the soma of neuronal bodies (Fig. 8). All identified pericytes also expressed ACE2, and some
endothelial cells labelled with the antibody against Von Willebrand factor (VWF), also expressed
ACE2 (Fig. 2B).

ACE2 expression in brainstem arousal and respiratory networks
In the pontomedullary region, we found a high expression of ACE2 in the neuropil and in cells of
the neurovascular unit clustered in nuclei that belong to the brainstem respiratory network (Fig.
3A). The nuclei where most of the ACE2 positive cells were observed were the parabrachial
nucleus (PBN), nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS), pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC),
retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), and Bötzinger complex. In the pre-BötC some of those neurons
were further characterized as glycinergic, expressing the glycine transporter type 2 ((GlyT2
immunopositive), Fig. 3, inset of panel E).

In the arousal-related reticular formation, a high density of ACE2 positive cells was also
found especially in the pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) and gigantocellular reticular nucleus
(GRN), see figure 4.

nuclei. A: Schematic representation of the location of the pontine reticular nuclei (PRN) and

and D) confocal photomicrographs show ACE2 positive cells identified in PRN. Arrows indicate
examples of some of those cells.
ACE2 expression in catecholaminergic and serotoninergic nuclei related to reward, movement
and motivation networks
High ACE2 expression was observed in brainstem regions that contain dopaminergic,
noradrenergic, and serotoninergic neurons. Figure 5 shows examples of ACE2-positive cells
expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of dopamine and
noradrenaline or tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the corresponding enzyme for the synthesis of
serotonin. Double TH+ ACE2+ cells were found in the dopaminergic substantia nigra pars
compacta (SNc, panels B) and ventral tegmental area (VTA, panels C) regions and in the
noradrenergic region of locus coeruleus (LC). At the medio-lateral level 0.18 mm examined within
the dorsal raphe (DR, panels E), we found a high density of TPH neurons co-expressing ACE2,
the glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), and calretinin (CR, a calcium binding protein), however we also
found sparse TPH+ neurons that were negative for ACE2 and did not express GlyT2 or CR.

ACE2 in diencephalic homeostatic networks
Compared to pontomedullary or mesencephalic ACE2 expression, lower ACE2 immunoactivity
was observed in the diencephalon. However, we identified cells expressing ACE2 in the
epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb) and in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic
(SON) and suprammamillary (SUM) nuclei (figure 6). The lateral habenula, a key modulator of
the aminergic centers of the midbrain, hosted a significant number of ACE2 positive for CR (figure
6, panels Bs). In PVN, we found that most of the vasopressin (AVP) expressing neurons co-express
ACE2 (figure 6, panels Cs). In the SUM, ACE2 expression was observed in TH-positive neurons,
but not in other NeuN-positive cells (figure 6, panels Ds)

Expression of ACE2 in cognitive networks
The hippocampus has a high expression of ACE2 in astrocytes and in some neurons mainly located
below the principal cell layers of CA1, and CA2. Astrocytic processes containing ACE2, appear
to contact the soma of the principal neurons in all of these layers. Fig. 7 shows the three Cornu
Ammonis (CA) areas with white arrows indicating identified interneurons expressing ACE2 and
yellow arrows indicating the GFAP-expressing astrocytes in close proximity to the neuronal
principal layer.

GFAP+ /ACE+ astrocytic processes, projecting into the pyramidal layer. Also notice that the
ACE2 positive neurons were mainly outside the pyramidal layer.

Expression of ACE2 in the main olfactory bulb
The olfactory bulb is one of the regions with the highest expression of ACE2, especially in the
glomerular layer (MOBgl) (Table 2). We investigated ACE2 co-expression with TH or CR,
molecules known to be expressed in the glomerular layer. We found that ACE2 is expressed in
TH-positive, but not CR-positive neurons in MOB (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8 ACE2 is expressed in TH positive neurons of the main olfactory bulb (MOB). A) Low
magnification photomicrograph of a DAB developed immunoreaction against ACE2 in the
olfactory bulb region at the lateral 1.4 mm coordinate. The highest expression of ACE2 was found
in the glomerular layer (MOBgl). Panels B and C show low power confocal photomicrographs of
sections double labelled against ACE2 and calretinin (CR, panel B) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH,
panel C). High power photomicrographs of the squared regions labelled as B1 and C1 are shown in
the lower panels. In the glomerular layer, ACE2 positive neurons were negative for CR (panel B1s)
but positive for TH (panel C1s).

Discussion
In this study, we report a widespread expression of ACE2 immunoreaction through the rat brain,
in a cell type and anatomical regional specific manner. It is particularly remarkable that in the brain
vasculature, the constituent elements for blood-brain barrier all expressed ACE2, with particularly
high density of immunopositive vasculatures in the olfactory bulb, the hypothalamic nuclei, the
midbrain dopaminergic regions and in various brainstem respiratory nuclei associated with
breathing regulation and arousal. Co-expression of ACE2 with other molecular signatures in
localized groups of neurons, participants of several well-defined circuits, such as for the respiratory
rhythm, arousal, reward, homeostasis, learning, and memory are described here in detail. The
potential impairment of these structures could be the neural substrates for the clinical
manifestations of COVID-19 and the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.
The expression of ACE2 in different tissues and organs has been associated with
maintenance of diverse physiological processes, for instance, regulating cell survival, oxidative
stress, angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis (Hamming, Timens et al. 2004, Rabelo, Alenina
et al. 2011, Uhal, Li et al. 2011). The first report on the brain expression of ACE2 was from tissues
obtained from human autopsies (Harmer, Gilbert et al. 2002). Initially, ACE2 was thought to be
present only in brain endothelial and smooth muscle cells (Hamming, Timens et al. 2004) albeit
animal studies in rats showed that astrocytes also expressed ACE2 (Gallagher, Chappell et al.
2006). In another study, neuron-specific expression of ACE2 was reported (Doobay, Talman et al.
2007). Recent studies in human and mouse neuroblastoma, glioblastoma and microglial cell lines
have also shown that ACE2 is expressed in all these cell lines, at both RNA and protein levels
(Qiao, Li et al. 2020).
ACE2 was the putative receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
coronaviruses (Li, Moore et al. 2003) and SARS-CoV (Lan, Ge et al. 2020, Lu, Zhao et al. 2020).
Moreover, coronaviruses can enter the brain and infect neurons and glial human cells (Arbour,
Day et al. 2000, Cheng, Yang et al. 2020), and evidence of CNS coronavirus infection has been
found in neural cells and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 patients (Arbour, Day et al.
2000, Cheng, Yang et al. 2020, Karvigh, Vahabizad et al. 2021, Song, Zhang et al. 2021). All of
these observations, amidst the complexity of COVID-19, suggests that the regulation of ACE2
itself, could play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathophysiology including neurological symptoms
and complications.
ACE2 in the blood-brain barrier cellular components
The blood brain barrier (BBB) is crucial to maintain an adequate milieu for a normal physiological
activity of neurons in different brain areas. It is composed of a continuous, non-fenestrated
endothelium, and the accessory peri-endothelial structures as pericytes, astrocytes and a thin
basement membrane (Reese and Karnovsky 1967). Endothelial cells through tight junctions seal
the paracellular space, restricting the passage of substances to transport mediated by transporters

or transcytosis. In the peri-endothelial space, astrocytes and pericytes regulate capillary flow and
transcytosis (Armulik, Genove et al. 2010, Segarra, Aburto et al. 2021).
In this study, we showed that the density and distribution of immunopositive vasculature
was heterogeneous between brain areas, with the highest density in the olfactory bulb, the
supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus, the
midbrain dopaminergic substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and nuclei in the pons and
medulla involved in the regulation of breathing and arousal (Table2). Through
immunofluorescence, we reported the expression of ACE2 in the cytoplasm of astrocytes, which
are key components of the BBB. Notably, we noted that the endfoot processes of these cells were
surrounding blood vessels (Fig. 2) and also had close contact with neurons (Fig. 7), suggesting a
possible route for neuronal infection. The other cells of the BBB are the pericytes and the
endothelial cells, we found that ACE2 was expressed in all pericytes and in some endothelial cells.
Recent histopathological studies from patients who died from severe COVID-19 indicate
the presence of endothelial inflammation at gray matter structures (Kirschenbaum, Imbach et al.
2021)). Neuroinflammatory abnormalities during COVID-19 could be partially explained based
on changes in ACE2 expression at the BBB of the vast brain network of capillaries, which could
affect integrity of endothelial tight junctions allowing passage of cytokines and inflammatory cells
into the brain. The diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 directly to nervous tissue and/or by infiltration of
infected lymphocytes to the perivascular space, would leave glia and neurons directly exposed to
the virus. Furthermore, cytokines might cause abnormalities in the excitability of neurons by
affecting neurotransmitter release, cell survival and synaptic integrity in certain brain circuits,
resulting in functional abnormalities (Vezzani and Viviani 2015).
It has been increasingly recognized that alterations in the normal brain hemodynamics is
a common feature of COVID-19 and vascular events such as stroke are frequent (Kakarla, Kaneko
et al. 2021, Sashindranath and Nandurkar 2021). Some imaging studies have shown alterations in
cerebral blood flow in patients with COVID-19 (Sonkaya, OztUrk et al. 2020). And even in
patients with no overt neurological manifestations, there are persistent alterations in the cerebral
blood flow (Qin, Wu et al. 2021). The results we present in this study, on the vascular distribution
of ACE2 in the brain, point out to potential regions where the presence of high levels of ACE2 in
the vasculature, might serve as a docking point for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain.
ACE2 in neuronal circuits
High-throughput single cell polymerase chain reaction and microarray studies have suggested the
identity of cells or brain regions expressing ACE2 (Fodoulian, Tuberosa et al. 2020, Lukiw, Pogue
et al. 2020, Muus, Luecken et al. 2021). However, little has been reported regarding the cellular
identity of neurons expressing ACE2 or about the circuits where those neurons participate.
Here, we report that ACE2 is expressed in discrete neuronal groups throughout the brain,
from the brainstem to the olfactory cortex. These neurons have a chemical signature that if altered,

might cause functional abnormalities at different levels, and thus, explain some of the clinical
manifestations of COVID-19. In the next sections we provide an analysis of the possible role of
ACE2 expressing neurons in different circuits and the possible pathophysiological consequences
of its disbalance in relevant physiological circuits.
Circuits for respiratory control and arousal
Several nuclei involved in breathing and sleep-wake transitions are in the rhombencephalon,
between the pons and medulla. The neurons responsible for modulating breathing can be largely
found in three groups of nuclei located in the pons, the ventrolateral medulla, and the dorsolateral
medulla. These nuclei are involved in the unconscious control of breathing by controlling the
contraction and relaxation of respiratory muscles in response to signals from chemoreceptors that
sense the concentration of oxygen or carbon monoxide in the blood (Dutschmann and Dick 2012).
The pontine respiratory group is constituted by neurons in the parabrachial complex. Neurons in
this group have been shown to project onto phrenic motoneurons and receive important sensory
input from the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) and chemoreceptor information from the RTN
/ PF nuclei. The activation of this nucleus causes abrupt cessation of inspiration and it has been
implicated in resetting the respiratory rhythm in response to sensorial stimuli. Lesions to these
nuclei inhibit the tachypnea induced by hypoxia or hypercapnia. The dorsal medullary group
consist of neurons located in the NTS. At least two types of neurons have been identified, one type
is presynaptic to phrenic motoneurons, the second type has been shown to receive input from
stretch receptors in the lung, and send outputs to other groups in the respiratory network (Bautista,
Pitts et al. 2014). The ventral medullary respiratory group consist of the RNT/PFZ nuclei, the preBötzinger complex and the Bötzinger complex. The RTN/PFZ has been shown to contain
PHOX2B-positive neurons able to sense CO2 concentrations (Onimaru, Ikeda et al. 2014). This
area also receives information about oxygen levels from the carotid bodies (Guyenet, Stornetta et
al. 2019). Mutations in PHOX2B are associated with a syndrome of congenital hypoventilation in
humans (Amiel, Laudier et al. 2003). The Bötzinger complex has mainly an expiratory function
with the adjacent pre-Bötzinger complex involved mainly in the inspiratory phase of breathing
(Smith, Abdala et al. 2009). The Bötzinger complex contains a large population of glycinergic
neurons (Winter, Fresemann et al. 2009). The presence of angiotensin II in the respiratory network
was noted in the late eighties by Aguirre et al, who reported a cluster of angiotensin II
immunopositive somata in the Bötzinger complex and Parabrachial nucleus and abundant
immunopositive fibers in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and medial PBN (Aguirre, Covenas
et al. 1989). However, the exact chemosensory mechanism of this process remained elusive. A
recent study used a microarray design to quantify the expression of ACE2 RNA in some samples
of human brain autopsies, the results showed that the most intense expression of ACE2 was in the
medulla and pons. In this study, we report the presence of a large group of neurons, located in
different dorsal and ventral nuclei of the respiratory complex that are ACE2 immunopositive
(figure 3). From the pontine respiratory group, we found ACE2 expression in neurons of the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN). From the ventral respiratory group, ACE2 was expressed in neurons

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.442293; this version posted May 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), in the glycinergic transporter (GlyT2) expressing neurons of
the pre-Bötzinger complex (PreBötC) and in the Bötzinger complex (BötC). From the dorsal
respiratory group, we found ACE2 positive cells in NTS. From the reticular formation, ACE2
positive cells were identified in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) and gigantocellular
reticular nucleus (GRN) (Fig. 3).
One of the main symptoms of COVID-19 patients is the lack of perception of dangerously
low levels of blood oxygen, a phenomenon called “happy hypoxemia”(U and Verma 2020). Also
of great concern is the high incidence of patients unable to restore their normal autonomic
ventilation after having been under artificially controlled ventilation. A possible hypothesis to
explain these observations, is that SARS-CoV-2 exerts cytotoxic effects on the infected cells of
the respiratory network. This could impede restoration of normal ventilatory rhythmicity or affect
chemosensation of CO2 and O2 levels in blood, thus inhibiting the perception of dangerously
levels of hypoxia or hypercapnia. A final possibility to explain the ventilatory anomalies observed
in COVID-19 patients, is that infection of ACE2-expressing cells down-regulates expression of
the latter, reducing the transformation of angiotensin II into angiotensin I. Excessive angiotensin
II could affect the function of circuits involved in breathing control. In support of this hypothesis,
an association between genetic variation in ACE activity, and fatal cardiorespiratory pathology,
has been reported (Harding, Dhamrait et al. 2003).
Circuits for hydroelectrolytic homeostasis
The paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei of the hypothalamus are crucial to
regulate blood volume and osmolarity (Dunn, Brennan et al. 1973). However, these nuclei also
innervate central targets in limbic and brainstem regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala,
habenula, and locus coeruleus and modulate behavioral cognitive and emotional responses (Cui,
Gerfen et al. 2013, Zhang and Hernandez 2013, Hernandez, Vazquez-Juarez et al. 2015,
Hernandez, Hernández et al. 2016, Hernandez, Hernandez et al. 2016, Zhang, Hernandez et al.
2016).
We found that PVN and SON are richly vascularized structures in the brain with high
ACE2 expression. Any vascular disruption would necessarily affect the normal functioning of
those nuclei. Moreover, we found ACE2 expression also in vasopressinergic neurons, confirming
previous reports using transcriptomic analysis (Nampoothiri, Sauve et al. 2020). It is known that
the secretion of vasopressin is regulated by the RAAS. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of
vasopressin (Sandgren, Linggonegoro et al. 2018). Mice overexpressing ACE2 showed a
diminished hypertensive response to the systemic administration of angiotensin II (Feng, Hans et
al. 2012) and reduced deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt induced hypertension (Xia, de
Queiroz et al. 2015). Also, pharmacological interventions that increase ACE2 expression in the
brain, have been shown to produce antihypertensive effects and a decrease in vasopressin release
(Hmazzou, Marc et al. 2021). A series of case reports have noted the presence of syndrome of
inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in COVID-19 related pneumonia (Yousaf, Al-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.442293; this version posted May 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Shokri et al. 2020). Current literature suggests that the increase in vasopressin seen in some
patients with COVID-19 is mediated by systemic inflammation, which acts as a non-osmotic
stimuli for vasopressin production (Swart, Hoorn et al. 2011) and kidney damage (Gheorghe, Ilie
et al. 2021). However, it could be argued that SARS-CoV2 directly invades the vascular structures
that nourish important AVP secreting nuclei in the brain, such as the PVN and SON, thus causing
important disruption in homeostasis that leads to altered hormonal secretion and, consequently,
SIADH, or that the direct infection of AVP producing neurons by SARS-CoV-2, leads to an
internalization of its receptor and subsequent accumulation of the hormone angiotensin II
stimulatory for AVP-release.
Circuits for reward, motivation, and movement
The two main dopaminergic populations of the midbrain are the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
the sustantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Three main pathways arise from these structures. The
ascending projections from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens are called the mesolimbic pathway
and have classically been described as part of a reward system (Wise 1978, Schultz 2002). The
projections from VTA to the prefrontal cortex are called the mesocortical pathway and have been
associated with modulation of cognitive, working memory and decision-making functions (Tanaka
2006, Lapish, Kroener et al. 2007, Verharen, de Jong et al. 2018). Finally, the nigrostriatal pathway
arises in the SN and terminates in the caudate and putamen, it has been associated with the
modulation of voluntary movement (Smith and Bolam 1990, Prensa, Gimenez-Amaya et al. 2009).
These circuits are modulated by excitatory projections from the lateral habenula (LHb), via an
inhibitory relay in the tail of the VTA (Barrot, Sesack et al. 2012, Bourdy and Barrot 2012,
Stamatakis and Stuber 2012). In this study, we found ACE2/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) coexpressing neurons in both VTA and SNpc.
The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) hosts the largest group of serotoninergic neurons and have
classically been implicated in modulation of mood. Studies have shown alterations in anatomy or
function of this nucleus in depression or anxiety and in suicide patients (Underwood, Khaibulina
et al. 1999, Bruschetta, Jin et al. 2020, Li, Zhou et al. 2020). This nucleus also participate in
modulating the core respiratory networks of the brainstem (Bautista, Pitts et al. 2014). The lateral
habenula have reciprocal connections with the DRN and is a critical modulator of the activity of
serotoninergic neurons. This LHb-DRN circuit has been implicated in the regulation of cognition,
reward, and arousal functions (Zhao, Zhang et al. 2015). In this study, we found ACE2/tryptophan
hydroxylase (TPH) co-expressing neurons in the DRN, some of them co-express the GlyT2, which
is an important population of projection neurons from DRN (Krzywkowski, Jacobowitz et al.
1995).
Interactions between brain-RAAS (McKinley, Albiston et al. 2003, Huang and Leenen
2009, Cosarderelioglu, Nidadavolu et al. 2020) and the dopaminergic system have been reported.
The infusion of angiotensin II in striatum provoke local dopamine release (Brown, Steward et al.
1996). Angiotensin II has been shown to regulate the synthesis of the enzymes involved in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.442293; this version posted May 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

catecholamine biosynthesis (Aschrafi, Berndt et al. 2019). Moreover, ACE2 has been reported in
the mitochondria isolated form cell cultures derived from dopaminergic neurons (Costa-Besada,
Valenzuela et al. 2018). It is normally considered that SARS-CoV-2 induce a downregulation of
its receptor (Kuba, Imai et al. 2005, Peiro and Moncada 2020, Verdecchia, Cavallini et al. 2020,
Zhang, Zetter et al. 2021). Diminishing the activity of ACE2 would lead to accumulation of
angiotensin II and possibly leading to a dysregulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons
expressing ACE2. This might partly explain emotional, cognitive, motivational and locomotor
symptoms observed in COVID-19. Moreover, the increased incidence of Parkinson and
parkinsonism reported in the recent literature (Helmich and Bloem 2020, Leta, Rodriguez-Violante
et al. 2021, Morassi, Palmerini et al. 2021) could be related to the above catecholamine metabolic
disfunction.
Circuits for sensory processing
In this work we found ACE2 expression in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb
(MOBgl), the enzyme was present in TH positive neurons but not in calretinin positive neurons
(Fig. 8). The olfactory bulb contains the largest population of dopaminergic neurons in the rat
brain, and those have been identified mainly as periglomerular, and playing a role in the
codification of the olfactory processing (Pignatelli and Belluzzi 2017, Kosaka, Pignatelli et al.
2020). Also, ACE2 neurons were observed in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and in the
upstream nuclei in the gustatory pathway, the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Besides their role in
the processing of taste information, these nuclei, as discussed above also participate in the
processing of chemosensory information related to the sensing of oxygen and CO2 levels. One of
the most classical symptoms of COVID-19 is the loss of taste and smell (Butowt and von Bartheld
2020, Mao, Jin et al. 2020). It may be possible that dysfunction of ACE2 expressing neurons in
these sensorial circuits underly the anosmia and ageusia observed in the acute phase of the disease,
and that long lasting changes in these circuits might explain the protracted alterations that some
patients report after recovery (Marshall 2021).
The distribution of ACE2 in neuronal, astrocytic, and epithelial cells of the mammalian
central nervous system, especially the evidence for heterogeneity in abundance of expression
throughout the brain, provides a template for understanding neurological manifestations of SARSCoV-2 infection both during infection and following viral clearance. Changes in the abundance of
ACE2, its effect on the peptides generated by this enzyme, as well as selective neuronal
damage/death in a given neural circuit, merit urgent further investigation.
