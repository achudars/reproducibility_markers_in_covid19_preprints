Abstract
Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients exhibit multiple organ malfunctions
with a primary manifestation of acute and diffuse lung injuries. The Spike protein of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial to mediate viral entry into host cells;
however, whether it can be cellularly pathogenic and contribute to pulmonary hyper-inflammations
in COVID-19 is not well known.
Methods and Findings In this study, we developed a Spike protein-pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus
with the proper tropism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on the surface and tracked down the fate
of Spp in wild type C57BL/6J mice receiving intravenous injection of the virus. A lentivirus with
vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was used as the control. Two hours post-infection
(hpi), Spp showed more than 27-75 times more viral burden in the lungs than other organs; it also
exhibited about 3-5 times more viral burden than VSV-G lentivirus in the lungs, liver, kidney and
spleen. Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR+
macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1+ macrophages. IL6, IL10, CD80
and PPAR-γ were quickly upregulated in response to infection of Spp lentivirus in the lungs in
vivo as well as in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further confirmed that forced
expression of the Spike protein in RAW264.7 cells could significantly increase the mRNA levels
of the same panel of inflammatory factors.
Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone can induce
cellular pathology, e.g. activating macrophages and contributing to induction of acute
inflammatory responses.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a significant threat to global health. So far, more
than 64 million infections and 1.5 million victims have been reported worldwide including 191
countries and regions. The US alone has registered more than 14 million cases and 271 thousand
deaths as of date December 4, 2020 [1]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is the causative organism for COVID-19 [2]. SARS-CoV-2, a positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus, is the newest and seventh known coronavirus that is capable of infecting
humans [2, 3]. The SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) protein can be cleaved by Furin to produce subunits
S1 and S2 to form a trimer which can mediate viral entry into host cells via surface angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4]. Host Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is also
capable of promoting SARS-CoV-2 entry of target cells by cleavage of the S2’ site in the S2
subunit [5, 6]. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been found to co-express in lung type II pneumocytes,
ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells [7], which are thought to be host
determinants for viral infection in the initial stage. Recently, Neuropillin (NRP) 1 has been
identified as the second host factor to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry of target cells which appears
to be ACE2-independent since a different binding motif is used [8-10].
COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The mortality rate of the COVID-19
varies in different geographic locations and patient populations [1]. Patients with metabolicassociated preconditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disorders (CVD), obesity and
diabetes mellitus (DM) are experienced to develop more severe symptoms [11]. COVID-19
patients also showed decreases in serum lipid levels [12, 13]. SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperinflammation in the lungs is considered to cause the disease progression. The molecular
mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis have just begun to be elucidated. In this study, we aim
to investigate whether the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with macrophages and induce acute
lung inflammations in vivo using a S protein-pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus.

Methods
Materials
Phoenix cells and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA, USA). Lentiviral vector pLV-mCherry and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein
(VSV-G) expression vector pMD2.G were obtained from Addgene (Watertown, MA, USA). Coding
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S gene (GenBank: QHU36824.1) fusion with a c-terminal His tag was
synthesized in vitro (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) after codon optimization for expression in
human cells. The sequence was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector to obtain pcDNA-Spike. AntiSpike S1 subunit, anti-low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), anti-mannose receptor C-type 1
(MRC1), anti-CD68 and anti-human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV)-1 p24 antibodies were
obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA). The anti-His tag antibodies were obtained
from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA) and Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA, USA). Primers were
synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA, USA) and primer sequences are listed in supplementary table
1. RNA extraction kit was obtained from Zymo Research (Irvine, CA, USA). The RT kit was
obtained from Takara Bio USA (Mountain View, CA, USA). The SYBR green master mix was from
BioRad (Hercules, CA, USA). Wild type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
Generation of pseudotyped lentivirus
SARS-CoV-2 S gene (GenBank: QHU36824.1) fusion with a c-terminal 12xHis tag was
synthesized and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. Phoenix cells were grown in DMEM containing
10% FBS and co-transfected by pLV-mCherry and pcDNA-Spike or pMD2.G vector using a
calcium phosphate kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The supernatant with produced virus
(Spp or VSV-G lentivirus) was harvested 72-hours post transfection, clarified by centrifuging at
5000 g for 15 min followed by filtration of the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter disk. The virus
was collected by an ultracentrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 2 hours (hrs) using Beckman SW41 rotor.
The viral pellets were resuspended by cold PBS buffer and stored at -80 °C before use. The viral
particle number was determined using a real time RT-PCR assay to quantify the RNA copies of
mCherry.
Intravenous viral administration in vivo
The animal protocol was approved by the University of South Carolina IACUC committee. Male
wild type C57BL/6J mice (5-6 weeks old) were intravenously administered 100 µl of Spp or VSVG lentivirus (8x108 of viral particles) via tail venous or retro-orbital injection. The animals were
sacrificed at 2 or 24 hrs post-infection (hpi) and perfused by 50 ml PBS per mouse. The tissues

RAW264.7 cell culture, viral uptake and electroporation
Macrophage-like RAW264.7 (RAW) cells (ATCC® TIB-71™) were cultured in DMEM (10% FBS)
medium. The cells were changed into 2% FBS DMEM medium for overnight prior to viral uptake
assay. Spp or VSV-G lentivirus were added into RAW cells (4.8x107 particles per well) in 12 wellplate with 90% confluence and incubated for 2 or 16 hours. Following treatment, the cells were
washed with PBS three times and RNA was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Zymo, Irvine,
CA, USA). In a parallel experiment, RAW cells (5x106) were electroporated with pcDNA3.1,
EGFP-N2 or pcDNA-Spike plasmids (10 µg) using the following parameters: 2 mm gap cuvette,
250 ul sample volume and 120V (BTX Harvard Bioscience, Inc., Holliston, MA, USA). The cells
were harvested 48 hrs post-electroporation for analysis.
Real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assay
To generate cDNA, 1.0~5 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-µl reaction containing
1x RT buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µg of oligo (dT) 15-mer
primer, 20 units of RNasin, and 5 units of SMART Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA). The RT reaction was carried out at 42°C for
2 hrs. Seven house-keeping genes were screened for the normalization controls: GAPDH, Rps18,
Ppia, Nono, Rpp30, Alas2, and β-actin. We found that Rps18 and Nono showed much more stable
expression levels in tissues crossing various samples (data not shown); both Rps18 and Nono
were then used as controls to normalize the amplification data. Expression levels of a panel of 23
inflammatory genes (Supplementary Table 1) were determined using real time RT-PCR. The
reaction for the multiplex real time PCRs contained 1× SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA), 10 ng of each template, and 10 pmol of each specific primer in a 25-µl total
volume in a 96-well format. Each reaction was performed in duplicate under identical conditions.
The PCR conditions were one cycle at 95°C for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and
60 s at 60°C. Relative quantification of the real time PCR was based upon the amplification
efficiency of the target and reference genes and the cycle number at which fluorescence crossed
a prescribed background level, cycle threshold (Ct).
For immunoblot assay, cell lysates were extracted from RAW cells using RIPA lysis buffer
(Santa Cruz Biotech., Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and

transferred onto PVDF membranes. Anti-Spike S1 subunit, anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody, or anti-His
antibodies were used to detect the expression of viral proteins and followed by HRP-labeled
secondary antibodies. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Gel Imaging System (Hercules, CA,
USA).
Lung tissues from mice were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA,
USA) and embedded in paraffin. Approximately 6 µm thick sections were cut and collected. The
sections were blocked with 5% donkey serum and then incubated in a humidified chamber
overnight at 4oC with primary antibodies. Sections were rinsed and incubated with fluorescent
conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. Images were acquired using
ImageXpress Pico System (Molecular Device, San Jose, CA, USA) or confocal microscopy
system (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in Origin 2019. The paired t test or one-way ANOVA was
used for two groups or multiple comparisons test, respectively. The data was presented as “mean
± s.d.” and p < 0.05 was considered as significant.

Result
Tissue distributions of Spp in infected mice
We generated Spp lentivirus from Phoenix cells. Spike protein was shown to be cleaved into
S1 and S2 subunits assembled on the Spp lentivirus that were produced in Phoenix cells by
immunoblot analysis (Fig 1A). No evidence of full length, non-cleaved Spike protein was detected
in the Spp lentivirus (Fig 1A). A lentivirus using a helper vector expressing VSV-G was obtained
as a control, referred to as VSV-G lentivirus. Gag-p24 is the capsid core shell protein in both Spp
and VSV-G lentiviruses which was shown in both Spp and VSV-g lentiviruses (Fig 1A).
Spp or VSV-G lentivirus (8x108 particles) was intravenously injected into C57BL/6J mice. The
animals were sacrificed at 2 or 24 hpi and various tissues were collected for determining the viral
load. Both Spp and VSV-G had highest vial loads in the lungs at 2 hpi; Spp showed a factor of
27, 33, 55, 71 and 74 times the viral loads in the lungs compared to the liver, spleen, heart, aorta
and kidney (p<0.05, n=3~7 mice); Spp also showed a factor of 2.8, 4.1, 4.5 and 5.7 times viral
loads compared to VSV-G lentivirus in the lungs, spleen, kidney and liver, respectively (p<0.05,
n=3~7 mice) (Fig 1B). At 24 hpi, the viral loads for Spp decreased significantly in the lungs, heart,
liver, kidney and spleen (p<0.05, n=3~7 mice) (Fig 1B).

Pathological features of pneumonia in Spp-infected mice
We then asked whether the mice treated with Spp virus acquired pneumonia. There were no
evident histological changes in the lungs 2 hpi in both Spp and VSV-G groups. At 24 hpi with Spp
lentivirus, many pathological changes in the lungs were evident, including multifocal lesions,
inflammatory cell infiltrations, thickened alveolar walls, peri-vascular and peri-bronchial
infiltrations and fibroplasia with exudation of fibrin and proteins (Fig 2). We observed only mild
inflammations such as mildly thickened alveolar walls in the lungs in the VSV-G group at 24 hpi
(Fig 2). Taken together, Spp but not VSV-G lentivirus could induce acute and diffuse pneumonia
in the mouse lungs with very similar pathological manifestations observed in severe COVID-19
patients. These data also suggested that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 played an important role
in the development of acute pneumonia.
Cellular colocalization of Spp lentivirus in the lungs
We next examined cellular distribution of Spp lentivirus in the lungs. Spp viral antigen was
detected by an anti- His antibody. LDLr is expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells and
macrophages in the lungs [14, 15]. The majority of cells that demonstrated Spp lentivirus-uptake
(His+) (82.3%±11.4%) were LDLr+ cells, while 84.4%±14.9% of LDLr+ cells showed uptake of Spp
lentivirus (Fig 3). We then examined the types of macrophages with uptake of Spp lentivirus in
the lungs using macrophage markers CD68 and MRC1. We found 10%±4.4% of cells with
evidence of Spp lentivirus uptake were CD68+ macrophages, while 38.3%±19.3% of CD68+
macrophages showed uptake of Spp lentivirus (Fig 3). However, we could find little evidence of
MRC1+ macrophages that had uptake of Spp lentivirus (Fig 3).
Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs in Spp-infected mice
We next attempted to assess which inflammatory factors might be induced by Spp lentivirus.
We examined expression levels of a panel of 23 genes that are representative inflammatory
markers in macrophages (Supplementary Table 1). Two hours post viral administration, the
mRNA levels of IL 6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-γ showed a significant and rapid increase in the lungs
in Spp-infected mice but not VSV-g-infected mice as compared with untreated control mice (Fig
4). The levels of TNF-α showed an increase in mice both 2 and 24 hpi with Spp and VSV-g as
compared with untreated control mice (Fig 4). TGF-β showed a significant increase in the lungs
of Spp-infected mice only at 24 hpi as compared with untreated control mice and mice at 2 hpi
(Fig 4). We did not find significant changes in expression levels of other inflammatory markers
that we examined (data not shown). These data suggested that IL 6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-γ
were among those factors induced in a rapid response to the Spp infection.

Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines in RAW cells caused by the Spike protein
In order to investigate the potential immunomodulatory function induced by the S protein, we
infected RAW cells using Spp or VSV-g lentivirus. The mRNA levels of IL 6, IL10, CD80 and
PPAR-γ were significantly higher in the Spp-infected group at 2 hpi than untreated controls and
VSV-G-infected group at 2 hpi (Fig 5). Their mRNA levels were continuously increased in the
Spp-infected group at 16 hpi than 2 hpi (Fig 5).
We next electroporated RAW cells with pcDNA-Spike expression plasmid or two control
plasmid, pcDNA and EGFP-N2. The expression of EGFP two days post-electroporation showed
30%~40% transfection efficiency in RAW cells (Fig 6). The mRNA levels of IL 6, IL10, CD80 and
PPAR-γ were significantly elevated in S protein-expression group than pcDNA or EGFP-N2 group
(Fig 6).

Discussion
There is an urgent priority for global healthcare and the research community to mitigate the current
pandemic of COVID-19. Animal models that can replicate viral transmission and subsequent
pathological development are critical for this effort to understand the mechanisms of COVID-19
pathogenesis and develop effective anti-viral countermeasures. However, handling of specimens
infected with SARS-CoV-2 requires high-security biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities and BSL3 work
practices. We have developed the Spp lentivirus, which confers the Spike protein on the viral
surface to investigate host tropism in a BSL2 setting. More importantly, using this virus, we have
demonstrated the pathogenicity of the S protein in isolated cells and an animal model. Therefore,
our data have proven that the Spp lentivirus, though it cannot completely replicate the infectious
pathway and pathological process in human, is a very useful system to specifically investigate the
S protein-mediated cell type susceptibility, host tropism for infection and pathogenicity.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus can be detected in swab samples from upper respiratory track from
more than 80% of affected patients [16-18]. Viral RNAs are rarely detectable in blood of
asymptomatic patients or non-hospitalized patients [16], but have been found more frequently in
10.5% ~ 67% hospitalized patients with severe symptoms [17-19]. Using a supersensitive RTPCR RUO assay (low limit of detection at 625 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA/ml), blood SARS-CoV2 has been detected in 53% in mild-to-moderate patients and 88% in critically ill patients, with
levels of virus being associated with disease severity [20]. Viral shedding time (from positive to
negative) of blood is shorter than that of nasal swab [18]. An animal study also has shown that
intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in a transgenic mouse model expressing human ACE2

results in high levels of viral infection in lungs with spread to other organs [21]. These reports
demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can be disseminated from the respiratory system into the
circulatory system and to many other vital organs during the late stage of disease, which will
become one crucial determinant for a patient to develop severe symptoms. Therefore, it will be
necessary to recapitulate how the disease progresses under this viremia condition in an animal
model. In this study, we intravenously administrated Spp lentivirus into mice and attempted to
develop an animal model to mimic part of these critical conditions from patients. Our data show
high preference of Spp lentivirus residing in lung tissues and induction of an acute pneumonia,
which is thought to be mediated or contributed by the S protein. Therefore, although it may not
fully simulate the nature of the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 through upper airway to the lungs
at the initial stage of the disease, this study has shown valuable information relevant to
pathological progression of patients with viremia.
The S protein is thought to be the crucial glycoprotein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 to
mediate the viral entry of host cells. It can bind to ACE2 in the host cells, followed by an aid of
TMPRSS2 cleavage, leading to endocytosis of viral/receptor complex into the host cells. ACE2 is
present in type II alveolar cells, macrophages and endothelial cells in the lungs, which makes
them targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in pneumocytes and
endothelial cells from autopsy studies of COVID-19 patients [22]. In this study, we showed that
Spp lentivirus was mainly present in LDLr+ type II alveolar cells and macrophages in the lungs.
Those cells also express ACE2 [23, 24]. As ACE2 receptors in rodents have shown a much lower
affinity to the SARS Spike protein as compared with human ACE2 receptor [21, 25, 26], the uptake
of Spp lentivirus is less likely solely through the endogenous ACE2 in the lungs of mice. We
speculate that other receptors or co-factors may facilitate the S protein-mediated viral entry of
host cells via an ACE2-dependent or independent pathway for example NRP1-mediated entry
pathway [8-10]. These data provide insight into the possibility of multiple factors/pathways
involving SARS-CoV-2 entry of various target cells. The Spp lentivirus will allow us to investigate
the mechanisms of viral entry into target cells in further detail in future studies.
Since the Spp is a replication-deficient virus, it will be unable to generate a full spectrum of
pathological changes in host cells. We did not observe any evident lung inflammatory responses
in mice at 2 hpi from either Spp or VSV-g. Mice at 24 hpi after Spp but not VSV-g administration
developed acute, diffuse and evident lung inflammation. The pneumonia was transient and
resolved 7 days after Spp administration (data not shown). This study demonstrate that Spp is
able to replicate a portion of the acute lung pathology that SARS-CoV-2 causes in human. SARSCoV-2-induced hyper-inflammation in the lungs is considered to cause disease progression. For

example, the acute and diffuse lung injuries are supported by the evidence of upregulation of a
series of serum cancer biomarkers in patients [27]. Our data show that a portion of M1 but not M2
macrophages exhibit rapid uptake of Spp lentivirus in the lungs (by 2 hpi), which provides direct
evidence to support this notion. The severity of acute lung inflammation induced in our mouse
model is more prominent in Spp than VSV-g. Furthermore, a panel of inflammatory factors are
upregulated in the lungs post Spp infection, which also exhibit different patterns in the lungs with
VSV-g infection. In consideration of the S protein being the only difference between Spp and VSVg lentiviruses, these data lead us to speculate that the S protein may have executed a unique role
in the development of this lung pathology. Indeed, over-expression of the S protein in the RAW
cells can induce upregulation of the same panel of inflammatory factors, e.g. IL6, IL10, CD80 and
PPAR-γ, demonstrating that the S protein has a function to induce intracellular pathological
alterations. The detailed mechanisms underlying how the S protein contributes to the
inflammatory reactions in macrophages are unknown and will be studied in future.
COVID-19 patients with metabolic-associated preconditions have a high risk to develop more
severe symptoms. Our recent studies have shown that decreased levels of low and high density
lipoprotein cholesterols are associated with severity and mortality of the COVID-19 [12, 13], which
have been confirmed by many other reports [28-31]. The etiology of lipid abnormality in COVID19 is likely multi-factorial including liver dysfunction, cytokine storm-induced alterations of lipid
metabolism, virus-induced aberrant modulations in cholesterol synthesis and increased free
radical signaling to facilitate modification and degradation of LDL-c [32, 33]. The S protein also
has a binding pocket for fatty acids, steroids and cholesterol to modulate the host cell entrance
[34, 35]. In this study, our data show that LDLr+ cells have the highest level of Spp lentivirus
uptake in the lungs. This correlation together with previous reports indicates that lipid metabolism
seems tightly associated with SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung pathology. This data also
suggests a possibility that LDLr may be directly involved in viral uptake, which shall be
investigated in the future with the Spp lentivirus.
In conclusion, our data show that the Spp lentivirus can induce an acute and transient
inflammatory response in the lungs of mice. The Spp lentivirus preferably targets those
macrophages and pneumocytes with expression of LDLr in the lungs and lead to upregulation of
IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-γ. In addition, forced expression of the S protein can cause elevation
of IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-γ in RAW cells. Our results demonstrate that the S protein of SARSCoV-2 can activate macrophages and contribute to induction of acute inflammations in the lungs.
