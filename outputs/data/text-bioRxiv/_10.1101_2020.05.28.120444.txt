Abstract

25

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of

26

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents a challenge to laboratorians and healthcare

27

workers around the world. Handling of biological samples from individuals infected with the

28

SARS-CoV-2 virus requires strict biosafety and biosecurity measures. Within the laboratory, non-

29

propagative work with samples containing the virus requires, at minimum, Biosafety Level-2

30

(BSL-2) techniques and facilities. Therefore, handling of SARS-CoV-2 samples remains a major

31

concern in areas and conditions where biosafety and biosecurity for specimen handling is difficult

32

to maintain, such as in rural laboratories or austere field testing sites. Inactivation through physical

33

or chemical means can reduce the risk of handling live virus and increase testing ability worldwide.

34

Herein we assess several chemical and physical inactivation techniques employed against SARS-

35

CoV-2 isolates from Cambodian COVID-19 patients. This data demonstrates that all chemical

36

(AVL, inactivating sample buffer and formaldehyde) and heat treatment (56oC and 98oC) methods

37

tested completely inactivated viral loads of up to 5 log10.

Introduction

48

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of

49

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the world. On January 30th, 2020,

50

the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of

51

International Concern and upgraded it to a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. As of May 28th,

52

2020, there have been over 5.6 million laboratory-confirmed cases and greater than 350,000 deaths

53

reported globally [2]. Extensive testing is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis, contact tracing,

54

and mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread through isolation and quarantine procedures. Additionally,

55

extensive testing facilitates the global public health response against COVID-19, providing critical

56

information regarding the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.

57

Given the lack of approved drugs and a vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 isolates should be handled

58

according to strict biosafety and biosecurity measures [3, 4]. Extreme care in handling live samples

59

prevents occupational exposure and requires extensive technical training and appropriate primary

60

and secondary containment devices wearing recommended personal protective equipment.

61

Therefore, with the need for extensive testing in areas and conditions where biosafety and

62

biosecurity for specimen handling is difficult to maintain remains a major concern. Such scenarios

63

include the need to sample outside of designated testing centers, conducting field investigations in

64

difficult locales, non-secure sample transportation, and even testing in underequipped or under-

65

maintained laboratories. Inactivation through physical or chemical means reduces the risk from

66

handling live samples and increase testing ability worldwide.

67

Cambodia is a tropical, resource poor, least developed country (LDC) in Southeast Asia

68

with a large socio-economic dependence on tourism [5]. Cambodia is also a major hotspot of

69

endemic and emerging infectious disease [6]. One particular, but not unique, issue faced in LDCs

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.120444; this version posted May 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

70

is the expansion of testing capacity due to a scarcity of testing laboratories, especially in remote

71

provincial health centers. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 samples from these rural health centers requires

72

safe but rapid transportation to designated testing sites. Aside from active training and great care

73

when handling live specimens from suspected cases, transportation of potentially infectious

74

material requires increased protective equipment and packaging, often in reduced supply or of poor

75

quality, even in the best of scenarios. Therefore, simple and effective inactivation of suspected

76

samples that can be conducted onsite can greatly decrease risk of exposure during transportation,

77

handling, and testing, as well as reduce demand for protective equipment and supplies at a current

78

global scarcity.

79

Herein, we evaluated the efficiency of various thermal and chemical inactivation methods

80

on SARS-CoV-2 utilizing three separate SARS-CoV-2 isolates cultured from patient samples

81

collected in Cambodia to determine their effect on viral infectivity and RNA integrity tested via

82

real-time RT-PCR.

Materials and Methods

94
95

Cell lines

96

African green monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC# CCL-81) were used for the isolation and culture

97

of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Vero E6 cells were used for the titration of infectious virus via TCID50.

98

Both cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich,

99

Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD,

100

USA) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at 37◦C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Upon

101

infection with SARS-CoV-2 the culture medium was replaced by infection medium containing

102

DMEM, 5% FBS, antibiotics, 2.5 µg/mL Amphotericin B (Gibco) and 16 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin

103

(Gibco).

104
105

Virus culture and titration

106

Three SARS-CoV-2 isolates (designated hCoV-19/Cambodia/1775/2020, 1775; hCoV-

107

19/Cambodia/2018/2020, 2018; and, hCoV-19/Cambodia/2310/2020, 2310) were obtained from

108

patient’s swabs (combination of one nasopharyngeal and one oral swab in one tube of viral

109

transport medium) and cultured in Vero cells. Virus-containing supernatants, as determined by the

110

presence of cytopathic effect (CPE), were harvested six days after infection by centrifugation at

111

1,500 rpm for 10 min. The concentration of viable virus was measured by TCID50 assay on Vero

112

E6 cells in 96-well plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) [7]. Briefly, serial dilutions of viral

113

culture supernatant were inoculated onto cells using infection medium. After 4 days of incubation,

114

plates were inactivated with 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes then stained with 1% crystal violet

115

solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. Titer of viable virus was calculated

116

applying the Spearman-Karber formula [8].

117
118

Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 isolates

119

Inactivation was performed in triplicate using 140 µL aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (1775,

120

2018, and 2310; passage 3 from Vero cells). Chemical inactivation included: (i) adding 560 µL

121

viral lysis buffer (AVL buffer including carrier RNA; AVL buffer) from the QIAamp Viral RNA

122

Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 10 min at room temperature according the manufacturer’s

123

recommendations; (ii) 200 µL inactivating sample buffer (GeneReach, Taichung City, Taiwan)

124

containing 50% guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC) and 6% t-Octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol

125

(Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature; or, (iii) 140 µL 4% Formaldehyde in PBS (General

126

Drugs House Co. Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) for 15 min at room temperature. Thermal inactivation

127

similarly performed on 140 µL aliquots of fresh virus culture: (iv) 56°C for 30 min; (v) 56°C for

128

60 min; and, (vi) 98°C for 2 min in a thermo-block (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Sterile

129

DMEM treated in the similar methods served as negative controls, and untreated SARS-CoV-2

130

isolates as positive controls.

131
132

Analysis for viable virus post inactivation

133

To determine if any viable virus remained post inactivation, 50% Polyethylene glycol 8000

134

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in PBS was added (1/5 of total sample volume) to an aliquot

135

from each sample condition and incubated overnight at 4°C. Following incubation, virus was

136

recovered by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 1h. Precipitates were washed twice with sterile PBS,

137

re-constituted with infection medium, and used for infecting the TCID50 on Vero E6 cells and

138

recovery cultures on Vero cells. Negative controls were treated the same way to examine

139

cytotoxicity of possible remaining traces of inactivation solutions.

140
141

SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR

142

Following inactivation, RNA from one aliquot per condition per virus isolate and negative control

143

was immediately extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and stored at -80°C

144

until further processing. Real-time RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection were

145

performed in duplicate using the Charité Virologie algorithm (Berlin, Germany) to detect both E

146

and RdRp genes [9]. In brief, real-time RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript™ III One-

147

Step RT-PCR System with Platinum™ Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) on the CFX96 Touch

148

Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA)ABI. Each 25 μl reaction mixture

149

contained 5 μl of RNA, 3.1 μl of RNase-free water, 12.5 μl of 2X PCR buffer, 1 μl of

150

SuperScriptTM III RT/Platinum Taq Mix, 0.5ul of each 10 μM forward and reverse primer, and

151

0.25 μl of probe (E_Sarbeco_P1 or RdRP_SARSr-P2) using the following thermal cycling

152

conditions; 10 min at 55°C for reverse transcription, 3 min at 94°C for PCR initial activation, and

153

45 cycles of 15 s at 94°C and 30 s at 58°C.

154
155

Statistical Analysis

156

Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows, version 7.02 (GraphPad Software,

157

Inc., La Jolla, CA,, USA). Analysis of variance was performed comparing mean Ct values for each

158

inactivation method. Difference between standard (AVL) and each specific inactivation method

159

was determined using Dunnett’s test for many-to-one comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was

160

considered to indicate statistical significance. Agreement, including bias and 95% confidence

Results

185

Inactivation efficiency

186

All chemical and thermal inactivation methods resulted in the reduction of viable SARS-CoV-2 to

187

undetectable levels. Untreated virus isolates had a concentration of viable virus up to 6.67 x 105

188

(isolate 2310) before treatment (Table 1). Therefore, the reduction of viable virus across

189

inactivation levels was at least 5 log10. Precipitation of virus and complete removal of inactivation

190

solution before infecting Vero E6 cells for TCID50 titration ensured that no CPE was induced by

191

chemical products used in the inactivation procedure. Successful recovery of virus post-PEG

192

precipitation was determined by RT-PCR on the same samples used for TCID50. All attempts to

193

recover viable virus post inactivation on Vero cells were unsuccessful up to day 6 post-inoculation.

194
195

Effect of inactivation procedure on RT-PCR

196

There were significant differences between the Ct values for the RdRp (ANOVA; p<0.0001) and

197

E (ANOVA; p<0.0001) genes. Following many-to-one comparison of AVL to all other forms of

198

inactivation used in this study (Figure 1), only formaldehyde inactivation was significantly

199

different for the RdRp (Dunnet’s Test; p=0.0016) and E (Dunnet’s Test; p=0.0007) genes. In order

200

to demonstrate the agreement in Ct values for the inactivation methods compared to the standard

201

AVL, Bland-Altman plots are graphically presented in Figure 2 with cut-off values marked at two

202

Ct differences (dashed lines). Samples inactivated by formaldehyde were the only ones where the

203

absolute bias Ct value for all samples was greater than two compared to AVL for RdRp (-20.32 ±

204

1.75) and E (-19.80 ± 1.17) genes. All other inactivation methods resulted in absolute bias Ct

205

values of less than one except for the RdRp gene following inactivation at 56⁰C for 30 min (-1.15

206

± 1.08), though this was still within the limits of agreement.

207

Discussion

208

Following the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for universal testing, more

209

and more individuals are exposed to live virus samples, thereby increasing the chances of

210

occupational infection. The WHO and United States Centers for Disease Control (USCDC) have

211

released laboratory guidelines to mitigate risk of exposure during diagnostic and research

212

procedures [3, 4]. However, despite initial recommendations for handling within contained

213

biosafety cabinets, individuals working with these samples are still required to handle potentially

214

live virus at the initial steps of acquiring and preparing the suspected samples prior testing, thereby

215

increasing the risk of exposure. Potential exposure greatly increases in situations requiring large

216

numbers of samples to be processed under harsh conditions, in underequipped or poorly

217

maintained laboratories, and even within the sample transportation system, such as found in

218

developing or rural areas of the world. Therefore, the continued need for COVID-19 testing

219

worldwide requires utilization of simple and effective inactivation techniques.

220

Previous studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of chemical inactivation

221

techniques on SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12], the majority of these based on infectious agents of concern

222

such as Ebola [13] and SARS and MERS coronaviruses [14]. As with other viruses, the primary

223

step in the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 is viral lysis to begin the extraction of nucleic

224

acids. The buffers used in this lysis step yield varying results [11, 13, 15, 16]; however, unlike

225

previous studies [11], this study found that AVL buffer alone was successfully able to fully

226

inactivate up to 5 log10 of virus from three different primary isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Apart from

227

differences in isolates utilized and a slight reduction in titer, it is unclear as to the reasons why

228

AVL buffer fully inactivated in this study versus others, but further work is warranted to determine

229

the exact effectiveness of this step alone.

and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

230

Inactivating sample transport media, either made in-house or commercially available, also

231

presents an attractive way to inactivate samples at the point of sampling to ensure safe handling

232

along the transport chain and within the laboratory. These inactivating transport media include the

233

key components of many viral lysis buffers including chaotropic agents (GITC), detergents (Triton

234

X-100) and buffering agents (EDTA, Tris-HCL) to inactivate a preserve viral RNA. Previous

235

studies have shown that GITC-lysis buffers are able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 samples [11, 12];

236

however, the addition of Triton-X may be necessary for complete inactivation [11]. In line with

237

these studies, commercial sample transport media containing both GITC and Triton-X was

238

successfully able to inactivate up to 5 log10 of virus with no loss of molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

239

Apart from sample media and buffers utilized for diagnostic testing, various disinfectant

240

and inactivating chemicals are available for sample treatment. Formaldehyde has a long history of

241

use for inactivation against a number of viruses and in a number of fixation techniques, including

242

vaccine preparations [17, 18]. Formaldehyde has been shown to successfully inactivate both SARS

243

and MERS [14, 19, 20] and has been suggested to be a viable alternative for disinfection and

244

inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 [19, 20]. Formaldehyde treatment did successfully inactive up to 5

245

log10 of virus; however, this treatment severely impacted viral detection in subsequent molecular

246

testing. This decreased detection is not unexpected as formaldehyde treatment results in RNA

247

degradation and modification [21]. Therefore, formaldehyde treatment does not appear to be a

248

solution for increased molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing; however, it does remain a viable alternative

249

for sample inactivation or disinfection.

250

Perhaps the most studied technique thus far regarding SARS-CoV-2 has been thermal

251

inactivation at various times and temperatures [11, 22-24]. Several previous studies have shown

252

heat to be an effective inactivation technique against other coronaviruses, including SARS, MERS,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.120444; this version posted May 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

253

and human seasonal strains [14, 23, 25]. Similar to previous studies, 56oC heat treatment for 30 or

254

60 minutes was fully able to inactivate up to 5 log10 of SARS-CoV-2 from three different isolates

255

[11, 22]. Interestingly, while other studies utilized 95oC for 5 to 10 minutes for inactivation, heat

256

treatment at 98oC for only 2 minutes was also able to completely inactivate up to 5 log10 of virus.

257

These results are very promising as high heat treatment is extremely rapid and may be a vital

258

addition to the testing arsenal, as RT-PCR can possibly be performed directly from these samples

259

without the need for nucleic acid extraction [26, 27]. Interestingly, the shortened time period of

260

high heat treatment may mitigate some of the reduction in detection seen in previous studies and

261

make this technique more employable [11].

262

Overall, the agreement and retained sensitivity amongst RT-PCR results, combined with

263

the fact that all methods resulted in 100% virus inactivation up to a viral load of 5 log10, suggests

264

that any of the tested methods, except formaldehyde, are useful to inactivate SARS-CoV-2

265

samples. Given the WHO recommendation to “test, test, test,” these data can help to optimize

266

sample inactivation for austere or remote areas. Indeed, it may be possible to use basic tools such

267

as a stopwatch and boiling water to achieve 100% virus inactivation without compromising sample

268

integrity, significantly decreasing possible exposure during sample transportation and handling,

269

allowing for dissemination of testing to labs with decreased biosafety and biosecurity capacity,

270

and possibly reducing the global demand for a dwindling supply of PPE.
