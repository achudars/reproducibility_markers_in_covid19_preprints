Abstract
Corona virus spike protein S is a large homo-trimeric protein embedded in the
membrane of the virion particle. Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme
2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein
conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of
the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational
plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology
that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to
identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this
methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the
three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central
network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding
domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding
at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic Hbond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S
protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses
of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups
that could be involved in transient proton binding.

Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, a β-coronavirus from the same clade as SARS-CoV that
emerged in 2002 (Walls et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The genomes of SARSCoV-2 (also denoted as 2019-nCoV) and SARS-CoV are ~80% identical, and that of
SARS-CoV-2 is ~96% identical to that of bat coronavirus BatCoVRaTG13 (Zhou et
al., 2020); SARS-CoV-2 might have transferred to humans from pangolins
(Andersen et al., 2020). The surface of the virion is decorated with large membraneanchored spike proteins S (Figure 1) that bind to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2) (Briefing, 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2003;
Zhou et al., 2020), which is a zinc carboxypeptidase of the renin-angiotensin
system, and which cleaves specific vasoactive peptides (Crackower et al., 2002;
Donoghue et al., 2002; Tikellis et al., 2003). ACE2 is expressed in multiple tissues,
including of the respiratory tract (Donoghue et al., 2002; Hamming et al., 2004; Jia
et al., 2005; Tikellis et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2020), and its functioning has been
implicated in heart disease (Crackower et al., 2002) and diabetes (Batlle et al.,
2010; Tikellis et al., 2003). Binding of spike protein S to ACE2, and proteolysis, are
followed by major structural rearrangements of protein S, such that the fusion
protein is exposed (Gao et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2013) and protein refolding yields the
energy for membrane fusion (Colman and Lawrence, 2003). Interactions between
the spike protein and the host receptor, and large-scale structural rearrangements of
the spike protein, are essential for virus entry (Belouzard et al., 2012). Here, we
present a graph-based methodology to characterize hydrogen(H)-bond clusters in
large proteins, and use this methodology to dissect the potential role of H-bond
clusters in shaping structural plasticity and binding of the spike protein S to ACE2.
Corona spike glycoprotein S (Figure 1) is member of the family of type I viral
fusion proteins, which also includes the influenza haemagglutinnin, HA (Bosch et al.,
2003; Millet and Whittaker, 2018), the mouse hepatitis virus, MVA (Walls et al.,
2016), and the envelope protein of HIV. Protein S is arranged as homotrimers
(Figure 1B), each protomer consisting of a large N-terminus ectodomain that
contains domains S1 and S2 (Figure 1A), with S1 N-glycosylated at 21-35 Nglycosylation sites (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) (Figure S1B); glycosylation shapes
the folding of the S protein (Song et al., 2004) and impacts its proteolytic cleavage

(Reinke et al., 2017). The C-terminal region of the S protein favors assembly of
protein S into trimers, as C-terminal truncated S proteins are present as both
monomers and trimers (Song et al., 2004).
Spike proteins have two protease cleavage sites, the first at the boundary
between S1 and S2, denoted as the S1/S2 site, and the second within the S2
domain, denoted as the S2’ site (Millet and Whittaker, 2014; Walls et al., 2017)
(Figure 1A). Proteolysis of corona spike proteins can occur at different steps during
virion interaction with the host cell, and it can be mediated by different proteases
(Millet and Whittaker, 2015) depending on cell localization (Reinke et al., 2017).
Cleavage at the S1/S2 site was suggested to be a prerequisite for subsequent
cleavage at S2’, and this second cleavage might expose the fusion peptide
(Belouzard et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker, 2014). S2’ cleavage can occur at the
membrane of the cell being infected, where it is mediated by the host
transmembrane (TM) TMPRSS2 (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). SARS-CoV-2 protein
S also has a furin cleavage site (Figure 1A) absent from bat and pangolin viruses,
though the functional implications of this are unclear (Andersen et al., 2020).

Protein S consists of the N-terminus ectodomain, the TM helical segment, and a C-tail.

Trypsin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV occurs at R667 (Belouzard et al., 2009 1464), a
group that is also required for cleavage by the TM serine protease TMPRSS2 (Reinke et al.,
2017); cathepsin L-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV occurs at T678 (Millet and Whittaker,
2015). R797 is at the S2’ cleavage site of SARS-CoV (Belouzard et al., 2009; Millet and
Whittaker, 2015; Reinke et al., 2017), and R685 at the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2
(Walls et al., 2020). Note that exact amino acid residues range can differ in the literature,
e.g., in ref. (Wrapp et al., 2020) the RBD is indicated as amino acid residues 330-521 for
SARS-CoV-2, and 317-507 for SARS-CoV. Based on work with synthetic peptides, it was
suggested that the pre-TM region (PTM) participates in membrane fusion (Guillén et al.,
2008). (B) Overlap of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 protein S in the open (pink), closed
(green), and pre-fusion conformation (yellow). Unless specified otherwise, molecular
graphics were prepared using Visual Molecular Dynamics, VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996).

S1 contains the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (Babcock et al., 2004; Xiao et
al., 2003) that binds to ACE2 via an extended loop denoted as the Receptor Binding
Motif (RBM) (Graham and Baric, 2010; Li, 2013). The S1 domain of SARS-CoV
contains multiple Cys groups that are spatially conserved (Eickmann et al., 2003)
(Figure S1D); disulfide bridges shape the large scale-conformational changes of
protein S by contributing to structural scaffolds (Walls et al., 2017), and contribute to
a local fold important for membrane interaction (Lai et al., 2017).
The S2 domain includes the fusion peptide (FP), the two Heptad Repeats HR1
and HR2 (also denoted as helical regions HR-A and HR-B (Colman and Lawrence,
2003)), a TM segment that anchors the protein into the viral envelope, and a
relatively short C-terminus segment exposed to the interior of the virion (Figure 1A).
HRs are α-helical segments that contain sequences a-b-c-d-e-f-g, of which a and
d, which are predominantly hydrophobic (de Groot et al., 1987) contribute to helix
packing (Gao et al., 2013). The heptad repeats can form a long coiled-coil structure
that connects the ectodomain to the TM segment (de Groot et al., 1987). Such a
structural arrangement, in which the α-helices interlock at the hydrophobic groups,
gives structural stability to water-exposed α-helices (Cohen and Perry, 1986).
Following proteolytic cleavage of protein S, HR2 and HR1 separate from each other,
HR2 inverts relative to HR1 (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009), and HR1 and HR2
assemble into a six-helix bundle, 6HB (Bosch et al., 2004; Millet and Whittaker,
2015), also called the virus fusion core (Gao et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2004). This step
appears critical for the viral infection, because peptides derived from HR2 can
interfere with 6HB formation can inhibit infection (Bosch et al., 2004; Gao et al.,
2013), presumably by blocking conformational changes of the spike protein (Xu et

al., 2004). In MERS-CoV, mutations at Q1200 of HR1 might have contributed to
cross-species adaptation of the virus (Forni et al., 2015), and the T1005N mutation
to the efficiency of the virus cycle (Scobey et al., 2013).
Close to the membrane boundary (Figure 1A), the endodomain C-terminal region
of corona spike proteins have several palmitoylated Cys groups; this palmitoylation
contributes to membrane fusion (Petit et al., 2007; Shulla and Gallagher, 2009),
incorporation of S proteins into virions (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009), control of spike
protein anchoring and orientation relative to the membrane plane (Petit et al., 2007;
Shulla and Gallagher, 2009), and to shaping of protein conformational dynamics
during post-fusion folding of the 6HB (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009).
Spike protein S appears to associate with ACE2 independently of the
conformation of the receptor (Li et al., 2005) Upon binding, protein S undergoes
conformational changes required for proteolytic cleavage (Simmons et al., 2005),
whereas ACE2 undergoes shedding that could lower its local concentration in the
membrane (Glowacka et al., 2010).
Main conformations of spike proteins are typically described in terms of a native
state (prior to proteolytic cleavage), pre-hairpin (after receptor binding), hairpin, and
post-fusion (Eckert and Kim, 2001; Xu et al., 2004). Upon binding to the receptor,
protein S undergoes a conformational change that reduces the length of the spike
by ~10Å (Beniac et al., 2007). In the pre-hairpin intermediate of the HIV envelope
protein, the transmembrane subunit gp41 spans the membranes of both the virion
and host cell, and its N-terminus region is accessible to inhibitory peptides (Eckert
and Kim, 2001); the fusion protein is anchored to the target membrane (Millet and
Whittaker, 2018). In the post-fusion conformation, the HR1 region of each protomer
has refolded into a single long helix, and HR1 and HR2 have arranged into a 6HB
with the HR1 domains of each protomer interacting with each other and surrounded
by the HR2 helices, the latter of which have assumed an anti-parallel orientation
relative to HR1 (Walls et al., 2017); this structural rearrangement is thought to bring
about massive structural rearrangement of the S2 region, which lengthens from
~88Å to ~185Å (Walls et al., 2017).
Cryo-EM structures reported recently for the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 protein
S (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) provide invaluable information about

structural dynamics of the protein. The open and closed conformations of the
ectodomain (Walls et al., 2020) are largely similar to each other, except for the RBD
region of one of the protomers, which has an up orientation (Figures 1B, S2).
Likewise, in the pre-fusion conformation (Wrapp et al., 2020) one of the protomers
with the RBD in the up conformation (Figures 1B, S2). The precise correspondence
between these three structures and the sequence of structural changes and
associated energetics along the reaction coordinate of protein S is, however,
somewhat unclear, as HR2 is not visible in all structures solved (Walls et al., 2020),
and conformations proposed for protein S might depend on interactions of the fulllength protein S with the surrounding lipid membrane.
H-bonds are major determinants of protein structure and dynamics (Joh et al.,
2008; White et al., 2001) and can be used to characterize protein conformational
dynamics (Bondar and White, 2012; Karathanou and Bondar, 2018b). Importantly,
clusters of dynamic H-bonds help stabilize protein conformations and shift
populations when the protein is perturbed, e.g., by the binding of a ligand (Bondar
and White, 2012). We have recently developed tools that rely on concepts from
graph theory to identify H-bond networks and characterize their dynamics
(Karathanou and Bondar, 2018a; Karathanou and Bondar, 2018b; Karathanou and
Bondar, 2019; Siemers et al., 2019). Briefly, atomic coordinates are used to
compute graphs of the H-bonds of the protein and then queried to identify H-bond
paths that include a particular protein group of interest, or between two groups
(Karathanou and Bondar, 2019). Of particular interest as groups potentially
important for long-distance conformational couplings are amino acid residues that
function as communication hubs –that is, nodes of the graph that have multiple local
connections and are also along an unusually large number of paths that connect
other nodes of the graph.
Description of H-bond networks of proteins as large as the corona spike protein
(Figure 1) brings about the challenge of the very large number of H-bonds to be
analyzed, which would make it difficult to identify those groups particularly important
for long-distance communication, or coupling, between remote regions of the
protein. To tackle this challenge, here we implemented a new set of measures
based on graph theory and centrality computations.

We start by computing all H-bond clusters of the protein, i.e., all local networks of
amino acid residues inter-connected via H-bonding. As large H-bond clusters that
inter-connect different, remote segments of the protein, could be important for longdistance conformational couplings, we rank H-bond clusters according to size. In a
relatively large cluster, centrality values help identify groups important for H-bond
connectivity between remote groups of the cluster, and can inform on the relative
location of groups within the cluster: A high-centrality group is more likely to be
located at, or near the center of the cluster; when a protein changes conformation,
changes in centrality values for a given cluster indicate structural rearrangements.
We thus rely on centrality values to identify groups essential for local connectivity,
and sites where H-bond clusters rearrange as protein S changes conformation. To
characterize H-bond cluster rearrangement we use analyses of cluster density,
anchor groups of H-bond clusters, and H-bond cluster topology.
We find that the closed conformation of the ectodomain of protein S hosts an
extensive, central cluster of H-bonds, contributed symmetrically by the three
protomers. Relatively close to the ACE2 binding interface, each protomer of the
closed conformation of protein S has two sets of H-bond clusters contributed by the
same groups. In the open and, even more in the pre-fusion conformation, this
symmetry of H-bond clusters is largely perturbed. In structures of the ACE2-RBD
complex, four clusters of H-bonds mediate the binding interface. Sequences of
corona spike proteins have patches of carboxylate groups and of carboxylate and
histidine groups that could bind protons.

Methods
Datasets of spike-like proteins used for bioinformatics analyses. We prepared two
sets of sequences of spike protein S. Set-A consists of protein sequences from
various organisms, and thus can show relatively large variations in the amino acid
sequence; Set-B contains sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human hosts.
We extracted and curated the sequences as summarized below.
Protein S sequences for Set-A were extracted by performing blastp and blastx
(Altschul et al., 1997) database searches against the SARS-CoV-2 Database hosted
at the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, accessed March 26,

2020). For Set-B sequences we used the Virus Variation Resource, VVR (Hatcher
et al., 2017) to extract proteins available for SARS-CoV-2 genomes, selected
manually sequences of S proteins according to the database annotation, and
removed partial hits.
For the both Set-A and Set-B, redundant sequences were removed automatically
using a threshold of 100% similarity such that, when two sequences were identical,
only one was kept. The resulting datasets included 48 (Set-A) and 14 (Set-B)
protein sequences.
We aligned sequences of S proteins from Set-A and Set-B separately using
MAFFT (Katoh and Toh, 2008; Katoh and Standley, 2013). Each alignment was
manually inspected and curated, and figures of sequence alignments were prepared
using Easy Sequencing in PostScript, ESPript 3.x (Robert and Gouet, 2014). These
software packages were used for all sequence alignments described below.
Likewise, we inspected and hand curated all sequence alignments.
Sequence region corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. To inspect the sequence
variation in the region corresponding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 protein S we
started with the sequence alignment for Set-A generated as described above, and
extracted the sequences corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD groups R319 to F541
(Yan et al., 2020). Sequence regions corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were then
combined into a single multifasta file; identical sequences were removed. The
resulting sequences were realigned with MAFFT using SARS-CoV-2 as reference.

Dataset of ACE2 protein sequences. We prepared two sets of ACE2 sequences.
Set-C consists of orthologue protein sequences from various organisms, which we
extracted by performing blastp (Altschul et al., 1997) database searches against the
NCBI non-redundant protein database (accessed March 29, 2020). Set-D contains
human sequences of ACE2 from the 1000 human Genome project (Auton and
Brooks, 2015); for this set, we used the Ensembl project (Hunt et al., 2018) and
extracted the different protein haplotypes existing in the 1000 Genome Project for
ACE2 using the GRCh38 human genome assembly as reference. For both sets, we
removed redundant sequences according to a threshold of 100% similarity such

that, when two sequences were identical, only one was kept. The resulting Set-C
and Set-D datasets included 46 and 22 ACE2 sequences, respectively.

Analyses of the length of S protein sequences and amino acid residue composition.
The length of a protein sequence is given by the total number of amino acid
residues. To characterize the amino acid composition of S proteins we calculated,
for each sequence in Set-A, the total number of charged and polar groups grouped
into i) Asp and Glu, which are negatively charged at standard protonation; ii)
positively charged Arg and Lys; iii) His groups, which can be neutral or protonated;
iv) polar groups Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Tyr.

Motif searches for protein S. We used Set-A of protein S sequences to identify
motifs that include Asp, Glu, and His sidechains, i.e., motifs with groups that could
change protonation depending on pH. To identify motifs of interest we first inspected
the distribution of Asp, Glu, and His in the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 protein S.
Based on this, we chose for analysis motifs that consist of i) HE and HD; ii) D[HDE],
which includes DH, DD and DE; iii) E[HDE]; iv) D(3,4), where (3,4) indicates that we

Computations of the electrostatic potential surface were performed with the
Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver, APBS (Baker et al., 2001), in PyMol 2.0
(Schrödinger, 2015). We used the PDB2PQR web interface (Dolinsky et al., 2004)
to assign partial atomic charges and atom radii according to the CHARMM force
field (MacKerell Jr. et al., 1998). Electrostatic potential computations were restricted
to protein atoms.

Structures of the spike proteins. Spike proteins are homotrimers of three polypeptide
chains, or protomers, labeled here as A, B, and C. Disulfide bridges were included
as set in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) entry. All structures were
prepared by considering standard protonation for titratable amino acid residues, i.e.,

Asp/Glu are negatively charged, Arg/Lys are positively charged, and His groups are
singly protonated on the Nε atom. For simplicity, and since our analyses focus on
internal H-bond networks of the spike protein, sugar moieties were not included.
The three cryo-EM structures used for analyses (see below) lack coordinates for
water molecules. Coordinates for missing internal amino acid residues and H atoms
of the proteins were generated using CHARMM-GUI (Jo and Kim, 2008; Lee et al.,
2016) and CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983). Molecular graphics illustrating the protein
segments for which we constructed coordinates are presented in Figure S3.

Spike protein in pre-fusion conformation. The structure of the ectodomain of the
SARS-CoV-2 protein S in pre-fusion conformation was solved with cryo-EM at a
resolution of 3.5Å (PDB ID:6VSB (Wrapp et al., 2020)). The number of amino acid
residues of structures used for analyses is reported in Table 1. Chains A and B have
12 disulfide bridges each, and chain A has 11 bridges.

Dataset of structures of ACE2 bound to protein S fragments. We analyzed H-bond
networks in three structures of ACE2-protein S complexes as summarized in Tables
2 and S2. As computations of average H-bond graphs require the same number of
amino acid residues in the graphs to be averaged, where needed we used Modeller
9.21 (Marti-Renom et al., 2000) to construct coordinates for missing amino acid
residues. Lists of amino acid residues whose coordinates were constructed for each
structure are presented in Table S1. For all computations of graphs of H-bonds for
ACE2-protein S complexes we used regions S19 to D615 of ACE2, and T333 to
P527 for protein S.

The protein S fragment is a chimera of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, except for a RBM loop, and
SARS-CoV for the remaining of the amino acid residues (Shang et al., 2020). b)The local
resolution at the interface between ACE2 and the RBD is 3.5Å (Yan et al., 2020).

Criteria for H-bonding. We consider that two groups are H-bonded when the
distance between heavy atoms of the H-bonding groups is ≤3.5Å and the angle
between the acceptor heavy atom, the H atom, and the heavy donor atom is ≤ 60º.
For all structures included here in analyses we computed H-bonds between protein
sidechains, and between protein sidechains and backbone groups.

Graphs of H-bond networks: nodes and edges, paths, and shortest path length. A
graph of H-bonds has as nodes amino acid residues or heavy atoms that H-bond,
and as edges H-bonds between amino acid residues or heavy atoms (Scheme 1).
An H-bond path is defined as a continuous chain of H-bonds that connects two
nodes (amino acid residues) of the graph. The shortest path between two nodes is

the path that connects these two nodes via the least number of intermediate nodes.
The path length L of a shortest distance path is given by the number of H bonds that
are inter-connected in that path (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. H-bond paths and H-bond clusters. H-bond paths are identified with the
Connected Component tool of Bridge (Siemers et al., 2019). (A) Schematic representation
of a H-bond graph. Cyan dots indicate amino acid residues that H-bond, and thin lines, Hbonding. (B) We compute and report the centrality of each node. Here, node i1 has high BC
value relative to all nodes of the entire graph. (C) The H-bond cluster of node i1 is extracted
for analysis. A cluster size σ = 8 means this cluster contains 8 nodes. The shortest path
highlighted yellow passes via node i1 and it includes 6 H-bonds, thus its path length is L = 6.

Connected Components graph searches, root nodes, and H-bond clusters. A
Connected Component search (Cormen et al., 2009) starts from a specific node of
the graph, denoted as a root node, and identifies all H-bond paths starting from that
node. The result of the Connected Component search is thus a sub-network, or subgraph, of H-bonds, which we denoted as H-bond cluster.

Centrality measures to identify hot spots in H-bond networks. We use centrality
measures to assess connectivity within the network and rank the relative importance
of nodes in a graph of H bonds (Karathanou and Bondar, 2019) (Scheme 1). The
Betweenness Centrality (BC) of a node ni gives the number of shortest-distance
paths between any two other nodes nj and nk that pass via node ni divided by the
total number of shortest paths that connect nj and nk irrespective of whether they
pass via node ni (Brandes, 2001; Freeman, 1977; Freeman, 1979) (Scheme 1). The
normalized BC value of node ni is computed by dividing its BC by the number of
pairs of nodes not including ni. The Degree Centrality (DC) of a node ni gives the
number of edges (H-bonds) of the node (Freeman, 1979) (Scheme 1). The

normalized DC value of node ni is computed by dividing its DC by the maximum
possible edges to ni (which is N-1, where N is the number of nodes in the graph).

Cluster size and histograms of H-bond path lengths. The size of a cluster, σ, is
given by the total number of nodes (H-bonding amino acid residues) of that cluster
(Scheme 1C). A value of the cluster size σ = 2 is thus equivalent with a H-bond.
To identify regions of the protein with dense networks of H-bond paths, we first
compute all shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph. The length of
each H-bond path found is stored as an external list of shortest H-bond paths and
their corresponding path lengths.
To evaluate the size of the network of paths that pass through a high-centrality
node ni of particular interest, we select only the paths that pass through ni. The
histogram of the path lengths computed for ni network illustrates the size of the
network.

Detection of anchors of H-bond clusters from directed graphs, and cluster density.
Changes in nodes that delineate the periphery of a large H-bond cluster indicate
rearrangements in that cluster. We denote these peripheral nodes as anchors
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2. Anchor points and H-bond cluster density. (A) H-bond cluster with nodes shown
as pink dots, and H-bonds as black lines. (B) Node Nc with the highest centrality value from
the cluster is identified and used as starting point for a directed search to identify nodes n, o
that are connected only to inward edges, and nodes m that have both inward and outward

edges. (C) Nodes that have only inward edges are counted as anchors of the cluster. APL,
the distance between two anchors of the cluster, is given by the number of H-bonds that
constitute the path that connects two anchor points passing via Nc.

For a given H-bond cluster identified from a Connected Components search for a
root node ni, we compute all shortest paths from node ni to all other nodes in the Hbond cluster (Scheme 2A), construct a directed graph using all shortest paths
whose edges point away from root node ni, and query this directed graph to identify
all nodes nk that have only inward edges (Scheme 2B). Nodes nk are the marked
anchor nodes of the cluster (Scheme 2C). The node density of a cluster, ρ, is given
by the number of anchor nodes divided by the total number of nodes of the graph.

Conserved H-bond networks in ACE2-RBD complexes. A node or an edge of a Hbond graph is conserved when present in all H-bond networks analyzed. We
considered that nodes and edges of a graph are conserved when present in all
chains of the four ACE2-protein S structures we analyzed (Table 2). Thus, we
excluded from the computations of conserved graphs 21 amino acid residues that
are different between the chimera RBD from PBD ID:6VW1 (Shang et al., 2020),
and the wild-type RBD from the other three structures we analyzed (Table 2). For
conserved networks of H-bonds we report average centrality values computed for all
chains of the structures used for analyses.

H-bond clusters and cluster labels for the ectodomain of protein S. Amino acid
residues found to have high centrality values were used as root nodes in Bridge
(Siemers et al., 2019) for Connected Components searches to identify all H-bond
paths that connect to these groups. To facilitate comparison of H-bond clusters
computed for different protein conformations, labels of H-bond clusters give the
protein conformation, the protomer, and the amino acid residue with high centrality
value in the cluster. Thus, label ‘PA_D663’ indicates a cluster identified by searching
for all H-bonds of the high-centrality group D663 in protomer A of the pre-fusion
conformation. The open and closed conformations of protein S are indicated by the
letters ‘O’ and ‘C’, respectively.

Labels of H-bond clusters at the interface between ACE2 and the RBD of protein S.
For each of the four ACE2-RBD structures (Table 2) we first identified all connected
components of the H-bond network using the Networkx package (Hagberg et al.,
2008). In the second step, we selected those components that include direct Hbonds between amino acid residues of ACE2 and of the RBD. This led, for each
structure, to 3-4 H-bond clusters that we labeled as a, b, c, and d. The assignment
of specific amino acid residues to clusters a - d is the same for the four structures.

Results and Discussion
We computed graphs of H-bonds for the closed, open, and pre-fusion conformations
of the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 protein S, and for structures of the RBD of
protein S bound to ACE2. To identify H-bond clusters that could be important for
conformational dynamics and structural plasticity, we used centrality measures and
computed the size, path lengths, and densities of H-bond clusters. We performed
bioinformatics analyses to identify conservation motifs in spike proteins.

The ectodomain of protein S has an extensive network of H-bonds with relatively
few H-bonds between protein chains. Computations of all H-bonds involving
sidechains indicate that each of the protein chains, or protomers, of a protein S
trimer, has numerous H-bonds between amino acid residues: regardless of the
protein conformation we identified, for each protomer, between 238 and 286 Hbonds between groups of the same protomer (Table S2). There are comparably
fewer inter-protomer H-bonds, between 22 and 47 (Figures 3A, 3B, S5, Table S2).
There are ~798-902 H-bonds for each conformation (Figure 2A, Table S2).
In the pre-fusion conformation of the protein there are two regions with extensive
inter-domain H-bonds: one central region in which most of the inter-domain Hbonding belongs to two clusters (clusters p1 and p2 in Figures 2C, 2D), and a region
close to the stalk part of the protein (cluster p3, Figures 2C, 2D); each of these three
clusters includes at least one carboxylate group. A qualitatively similar picture of the
distribution of inter-protomer H-bonds is also observed for the open and closed
conformations of protein S (Figure S4).

A minority of H-bonding groups have high centrality values indicative extensive local
H-bond connectivity. The very large number of H-bonds identified for protein S
(Figures 2, S4, Table S2) makes it difficult to evaluate which groups are particularly
important for long-distance conformational couplings. To rank H-bonding groups
according to their involvement in H-bond connections, we first computed BC and DC
values for all H-bonding groups of the ectodomain of protein S in the closed, open,
and pre-fusion conformations (Figure 3, Table S3). In all three conformations of
protein S we analyzed, groups with BC ≥ 15 belong to groups for which coordinates
were present in the original structure, i.e., solved experimentally (Figure S5).
Most of the H-bonding amino acid residues of protein S have rather small
centrality values (Figures 3C, 3D), i.e., most of these groups lack extensive local
connections or participation in large numbers of H-bond paths. There is, however, a
minority of H-bond groups with significantly larger centrality measures, and these
groups are often charged sidechains (Figures 3, 4, Table S3).

Using cluster size vs. highest centrality value to identify rearrangements within Hbond clusters. In a H-bond cluster, the highest-BC node (group) would tend to be
located at the point where most paths connecting other nodes cross each other
(Scheme 2B). When, in two different protein conformations, a node i is part of Hbond clusters with similar size

σ, but yet the centrality of node i significantly

different, interactions within the H-bond cluster have changed. For example, in the
first conformation, node i was at the center of the H-bond cluster; upon
conformational change, interactions within the cluster have rearranged, and node i
is now at the periphery of the cluster (Scheme 2B). This scenario would suggest that
changes in the relationship between BC value and corresponding cluster size could
be thus used to identify H-bond clusters that rearrange when the protein changes
conformation.
To verify whether inspection of BC vs. cluster size σ could indeed be used to
evaluate structural rearrangements, we analyzed BC values of nodes from H-bond
clusters with σ ≥ 2 (Figure 5). For many clusters, BC values increase linearly, or
almost linearly, with cluster size (Figure 5): these are nodes with a relatively central
location within the cluster. For all cluster sizes, however, there are also nodes with

BC = 0: when σ > 2 these are peripheral nodes with DC = 1 (singular H-bond
connection), or in a few cases DC = 2.

We inspected closely the BC vs. σ values for H-bond clusters of all groups with
BC ≥ 15 (Figure 6). We found that the BC value of a group can vary significantly
among the three conformations of protein S, and traced these changes to marked
rearrangements of H-bonding within the cluster. In what follows we use examples of
specific clusters to illustrate cluster size and location in the cluster of the highestcentrality group. Schematic representations of selected H-bond clusters, ordered
according to the highest-BC group of the cluster, are presented in Figures S6-S13.

In protomer B of the pre-fusion conformation, Q239 has BC = 15 and is located
centrally in a cluster with

σ = 8 (Figure 6B); the other two protomers have σ = 2 - 6

and BC = 0. Here, Q239 is either at the periphery of a cluster, or it has only one Hbond (Figures 6B, 6C). In the open and closed conformations, Q239 has BC = 0 and
is at the periphery of H-bond clusters with σ values of 3 – 4 (Figures 6C, S6 A-D).
In the sequence of protein S, D663 is close to the S1/S2 protease cleavage site
(Figure 1A). All protomers of the closed conformation, and two protomers of the
open conformation, have D663 H-bonded to K310 (BC = 0, σ = 2, 6C, 6D Figures
S8A-F); the third protomer of the open conformation has D663 part of a small Hbond cluster (BC = 2, σ = 4) with K310, E661, and Y695 (Figure S8F). The
protomers of the pre-fusion conformation have markedly different arrangements of
H-bonds at site D663: Protomer A, whose RBD is in the up conformation (Figure
3A), has a relatively large D663 cluster with σ = 9, and BC = 20 for D663 (Figures
6C, 6D, S8G); this cluster includes K310, E661, and Y695. In protomer B, the D663
cluster is smaller (σ = 6, and BC = 9, Figures 6C, 6D), but it still includes E661 and
Y695 (Figure S9H); in protomer C, D663 is again engaged in a singular H-bond with
K310 (Figures 6C, 6D, S9I).
E819 is located relatively close to the S2’ proteolytic cleavage site (Figure 1A). In
the closed and open conformations, E819 is part of small clusters (σ = 4) arranged
symmetrically, and it has BC = 3 (Figures 6C, S9 A-F). BC and σ values indicate
altered H-bonding in pre-fusion, where each protomer has a distinct H-bond cluster
that can be as large as σ = 9, with BC = 21 (Figures 6C, 6D, S9G-I).
Downstream the sequence of protein S, D843 is located centrally (BC = 24) in a σ
= 10 cluster in one protomer of the closed conformation, but it has BC = 0 – 1 in the
other two closed protomers, and in the open and pre-fusion conformations (Figures
6C, 6D, S10). At the D848 site, BC and σ values indicate relatively large clusters in
one of the open-conformation protomers, and one pre-fusion (Figures 6C, 6D, S11).

H-bond clusters can rearrange drastically during conformational dynamics of protein
S. R509 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 1A) corresponds to SARS-CoV R495, a
group whose mutation to Ala decreases binding to ACE2 (Chakraborti et al., 2005)
(Table S4). In the closed conformation, each protomer hosts relatively large R509

clusters with σ = 8, constituted by the same groups (Figures 6C, 6D, 7A, 7B, 8A-C).
R509 H-bonds to D442, a group whose mutation to Ala abolishes ACE2 binding
(D429 in SARS-CoV protein S (Chakraborti et al., 2005)); N448 and N450 of the
R509 cluster (Figures 8A-C) are adjacent in the sequence to Y449, a group that Hbonds to an ACE2 group in the crystal structure of ACE2 bound to SARS-CoV-2
RBD (Lan et al., 2020). Relatively close to the RBD, each protomer of the closed
conformation has symmetrical D578 H-bond clusters with σ = 10 (Figures 6C, 6D,
7A, S7 A-C, J-L).

Only protomer A of the pre-fusion conformation has a large H-bond cluster at the R509 site.

Two of the open conformation protomers have R509 clusters with σ = 5-6, and
in the third protomer the H-bond between D442 and R509 is no longer part of a
cluster (Figures 8D-E). Nevertheless, all groups that participate in the altered R509
H-bond clusters of the open conformation were part of this cluster in the closed
conformation. In the pre-fusion conformation, the RBD of the protomer in the up
conformation has a large R509 cluster with σ = 12 (Figures 7E, 8G), whereas the
other two protomers lack H-bond clusters at R509 (Figures 7E, 8H); the large R509

cluster of RBD-up has at its core 5 groups of the closed-conformation cluster, and 7
new groups. In a protomer of the open conformation, the D578 cluster lacks 5 of its
H-bond groups (Figures 7C, S7D-F). In pre-fusion, D578 is part of a relatively small
H-bond cluster on one of the protomers, and has just singular H-bonds in the other
two protomers (Figures 7E, S7G-I).
Both the R509 and the D578 clusters have markedly different topologies in the
open and pre-fusion conformations of the protein (Figures 7C, 7D, 8B, 8C, 9D-H,
S7): Here, the three-fold symmetry observed in the closed conformation is absent.

The central H-bond cluster of the closed conformation of protein S. The most
prominent H-bond cluster of the closed conformation is located close to the stalk of
the ectodomain: The R1039 cluster includes no fewer than 33 groups, 11 from each
protomer, with BC = 218 for R1039 (cluster CC_R1039 in Figures 4A, 7A). Indeed,
this R1039 cluster is the largest we identified for all three protein conformations
(Figures 3, 4). We denote the R1039 cluster of the closed conformation as the
central H-bond cluster (Figures 7A, 9A).
At the core of the central cluster, R1039 of each protomer bridge to each other
via H-bonding to E1031, and branch out via S1037 (Figure 9A); the branches
include R905, a high-centrality group with BC = 61. The anchor groups of this
cluster include E725, and the backbones of G1035 and L1049 (Figure 9A).
The open and pre-fusion conformations have markedly different topologies of the
central H-bond cluster. R905 and R1039 are now part of distinct H-bond clusters
with significantly smaller σ and BC values. In the open conformation, the R1039
cluster retained three-fold compositional symmetry as observed for the closed
conformation (Figures 9A, 9B). In the pre-fusion conformation this symmetry is lost,
as the R1039 cluster connects pairs of protomers, instead of all protomers, or it can
even be reduced to a single H-bond (Figures 9C-E). At the R905 site, both the
open- and pre-fusion conformations have altered H-bonding relative to the close
conformation, and loss of the three-fold symmetry (Figure S13). H-bond paths that
interconnect anchor groups of the R1039 clusters vary drastically, from APL = 8-14
in the closed conformation, to APL = 2-6 in the open and closed conformations
(Figure 9F). The distribution of APL values for clusters in different protein

conformations can thus be used to identify sites where the topology of a cluster
changes.

composition. (A) Selected H-bond clusters with their anchor, internal, and high-BC nodes
colored blue, cyan, and red, respectively. (B) Cluster density ρ for high-BC groups found in
the three protein conformations. The cluster density ρ is given by the number of anchor
nodes divided by the total number of nodes of the graph. Analyses of cluster density for the
closed and open conformations are presented in Figure S14.

Inspection of cluster densities for selected H-bond clusters suggests there are
more H-bond clusters for which three-fold symmetry is present in the closed
conformation, but absent in open and/or pre-fusion (Figures 10, S14). Marked
changes in cluster composition, as identified with cluster densities, are supported by
the path length distributions (Figure 11).
The central R1039 cluster of the closed state has H-bond paths as long as 13 Hbonds that inter-connect as a linear path (Figure 9A), which corresponds to the
shortest-distance paths between the E725 anchors passing via R1039 (Figure 11A).
Paths of the other clusters we inspected are significantly smaller, with typical linear
lengths L ≤ 6 (Figure 11).
Taken together, the analyses above indicate that the closed conformation of the
ectodomain of protein S is characterized by a remarkable central R1039 cluster of
32 H-bonds with three-fold symmetry, and by relatively large R509 clusters at the
RBD, with the same amino acid composition in each protomer. These two clusters,

and other H-bond clusters, are significantly altered in the open and closed
conformations of the ectodomain of protein S.

H-bond clusters extend deep across the ACE2-RBD binding interface. Infection with
coronavirus largely depends on the affinity with which the spike protein binds to
ACE2 (Li, 2013). Mouse cells, which normally bind SARS-CoV poorly, could bind
SARS-CoV when expressing human ACE2 (Li, 2013), and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
binds stronger to ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV (Tai et al., 2020).
A number of amino acid residues important for binding to ACE2 have been
identified for SARS-CoV protein S (Chakraborti et al., 2005; Graham and Baric,
2010). Charged, polar, and hydrophobic groups were found important,(Chakraborti
et al., 2005) suggesting that both H-bonding and hydrophobic packing play
important roles in complex formation. X-ray and cryo-EM structures of ACE2 bound
to fragments of SARS-CoV-2 protein S (Lan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020), or to a
chimera protein S fragment (Shang et al., 2020), allowed identification of H bonds
and salt bridges between the RBD and ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020;
Yan et al., 2020). In SARS-CoV, groups thought particularly important for ACE2

binding include E452 and D454, as mutation to Ala decreases and, respectively,
abolishes binding (Wong et al., 2004), and R426 and N473, which were proposed to
be hot spots with energetically favorable contributions to the binding of SARS-CoV
RBD to ACE2 (Chakraborti et al., 2005).
We wondered whether, instead of single H-bonds and salt-bridges, entire clusters
of H-bonds, as we identified above for protein S, could mediate binding of protein S
to ACE2. We thus computed graphs of H-bonds for ACE2-RBD complexes (Figures
12, S15-S24) and centrality values (Tables S4, S5).

B and E. Additional analyses of H-bond clusters at the interface between ACE2 and the
RBD are presented in Figures S17-S27.

All structures we analyzed have at the ACE2-RBD binding interface 3-4 H-bond
clusters, which we denote as the local interface clusters as a, b, c, and d (Figures
12, S15-S24). In Figure 12 we present H-bonds of the full-length ACE2 bound to the
RBD, that are present in all ACE2-RBD structures we analyzed; each of these
structures can have more H-bonds contributing to the interface clusters (Figures
S22A, S23, S24).
In full-length ACE2 bound to RBD (PDB ID:6M17, chains B, E) (Yan et al., 2020)
cluster a has 16 RBD groups, and 10 ACE2 groups (Figure 12C). In structure PDB
ID:6M0J (Yan et al., 2020) cluster a is significantly larger, with 31 and 14 groups
contributed by the RBD and ACE2, respectively (Figures S22B, S24B). The larger
size of the interface cluster a in the latter structure could be due the resolution being
slightly higher (Table 2), or to the protein conformation being different.
The four interface clusters include groups whose functional role has been probed
experimentally (Table S4), groups that have relatively high centrality values (Tables
S5, S6), and groups that we find to be highly conserved among sequences of
protein S (Figure 12C, Tables S4, S7). N501 of SARS-COV-2 protein S is T487 in
SARS-CoV protein S, in which the methyl group of the Thr is thought important for
the binding of the RBD to ACE2 (Li et al., 2005); T487 is among the amino acid
residues essential for the binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2. Y449 corresponds to
Y436 of SARS-CoV protein S, and is conserved in SARS spike proteins that use
ACE2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
N437 and D442 of the interface cluster a (Figure 12C) are also part of the highcentrality cluster R509 identified in the up protomer of the pre-fusion conformation of
isolated protein S (Figures 3A, 3B, 7A). In cluster b, Q493 is part of a H-bond
network that includes ACE2 K31 (Figure 12C) a group considered a virus binding

hot spot (Wan et al., 2020). This cluster contains two other ACE2 groups, and two
from the RBD.
Given the extensive H-bond network we observe for ACE2 (Figure 12A), and the
large number of ACE2 groups that participate in interface H-bonding (Figures 12C,
12D), we wondered whether ACE2 groups that participate in interface H-bond
clusters might reach the vicinity of the catalytic site of the enzyme, or groups known
to be otherwise important for the functioning of ACE2.
R273, H345, E375, H505, and Y515 delineate an inhibitor-binding site of ACE2
(Guy et al., 2005), whereas H374, H378, and E402 coordinate the Zn2+ ion (Towler
et al., 2004). According to our centrality computations, R273 is within 4 amino acid
residues of the high-centrality group D269 (Figures 12A, 12B), and H378 has
relatively high average DC value.
To find out whether these key ACE2 groups are part of H-bond networks that
could be affected by the binding of protein S, we searched for H-bond clusters of
R273, H345, H505, H378, H374, and E402. The H-bond clusters we identified
(Figure S25) lack common H-bonds with the conserved interface clusters presented
in Figure 12A; nevertheless, the H378 H-bond cluster (Figure 12B) is relatively close
in space to the interface (Figures 12B, S25C). In structure PDB ID:6M0J (Yan et al.,
2020) of RBD-bound ACE2, N394 is part of interface cluster a (Figure S24B); three
positions upstream the sequence, N397 is part of the H405 cluster of ACE2 (Figure
S25B). Thus, depending on the protein conformation, interface H bonding of ACE2
can extend deep into the protein, towards the active site. That an entire local,
dynamic H-bond network, could be important for protein binding, was observed
before for arrestin (Ostermeier et al., 2014).

Corona spike protein S sequences carry a significant net negative charge. Results
of the bioinformatics analyses for protein S are summarized in Figures 13, S26-S29,
Tables S4 and S7, and in Supporting Information Sequence Analyses.
We find that the 47 protein S sequences included in Set-A have full length in the
range of 1235-1363 amino acid residues (Figure 13A). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 proteins S are thus among the shorter sequences of Set-A. All protein sequences
have an estimated net negative charge between -3e and -25e (Figure 13B); for

SARS-CoV-2 protein S, the net estimated charge is -7e. Most of the protein
sequences have ~100-118 Asp and Glu groups (Figure S26A), ~85-105 Arg and
Lys, and ~10-20 His groups (Figures S26B, S26C).
The shortest spike protein sequences, 1236 amino acid residues, are of the
mouse hepatitis virus; this sequence also carries the smallest estimated charge.
The four longest sequences, 1363 amino acid residues, are of corona viruses
isolated from rabbit, deer, bovine, and horse; these are also the sequences with
significant negative charges of -20e or -23e (Figure 13B). The net estimated charge
of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences from human hosts (Set-B) appears largely
conserved, as only three positions affected by mutations are occupied by a charged
group, D614, R408, and K814 (Table S7).

When aligning the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with the sequences of the other 47
protein S sequences from Set-A, we obtained regions with 142 – 241 amino acid
residues (Figure S28A) and an estimated net charge that tends to be positive
(Figure S26B). The variation in the length of the region corresponding to SARSCoV-2 RBD, and the associated variation in estimated charge, is due to numerous
deletions and insertions of amino acid residues in other protein S sequences from
Set-A (see Supporting Information Sequence Alignments). As the precise range of
amino acid residues that constitute the RBD would need to be identified
experimentally, our analyses of the RBD region serve only to illustrate the significant
variation in length and composition of the corona virus protein S regions
corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 protein S.
A slightly positive net charge of the RBD of protein S could be important for the
binding of protein S to ACE2: The electrostatic potential surfaces of both SARSCoV-2 protein S and ACE2 have patches that are predominantly negative or
positive; at the binding interface, ACE2 exposes a predominantly negative surface,
whereas the potential energy surface for the RBD is predominantly positive (Figures
S30-S34). The complementary electrostatic potential surfaces at the region where
the RBD binds to ACE2 are compatible with the presence of multiple H-bonds and
H-bond clusters we identified (Figure 12).

Carboxylate patches of SARS-CoV-2 protein S, and carboxylate and carboxylatehistidine motifs of corona virus spike proteins with putative role in proton binding.
Proton binding and pH sensing by SARS proteins S is poorly described. Fusion of
protein S with the host cell can occur at neutral pH (Xiao et al., 2003), and
conformational changes of the ectodomain can occur independent of the pH (Walls
et al., 2017). Acidic pH might, nevertheless, impact SARS-CoV infection indirectly,
via the involvement of a pH-dependent protease, cathepsin L, which is found in the
endosomes (Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Simmons et al., 2005). In vitro experiments
on the recombinant ectodomain of SARS-CoV suggest that, at pH between 5 and 6,
monomers form trimers irreversibly (Li et al., 2006). Cell infection with SARS-CoV is
calcium dependent, in that depleting intracellular or extracellular calcium lowers
infection (Lai et al., 2017). Each of the two peptide fusion regions (Figure 1A) is

thought to bind one calcium ion via negatively-charged carboxylate groups, and this
binding would shape local protein structure and membrane interactions (Lai et al.,
2017; Millet and Whittaker, 2018).
As patches of carboxylate and histidine groups are of particular interest as
potential proton-binding sites at protein surfaces (Bondar and Lemieux, 2019;
Gerland et al., 2020; Guerra and Bondar, 2015; Kemmler et al., 2019), we analyzed
Set-A sequences for motifs that could be relevant to proton binding. We found that
the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 protein S has multiple positions at which
Asp, Glu or His groups are adjacent in the sequence, or separated by 1-2 amino
acid residues; of the 17 His groups of the protein, 7 are within the C-terminal ~220
residue fragment (Figures 13C, S35A). Moreover, particular arrangements, or
motifs, appear multiple times in the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 protein S (Figures
13C, S27, S28A). There are several positions with 2-3 carboxylates consecutive in
the sequence; close to the C-terminus, there is a DEDSE motif (Figure S27).
To evaluate how frequent are carboxylate and carboxylate-histidine motifs in
corona protein S sequences of Set-A we extracted, from each sequence, the
number of motifs with two consecutive carboxylates, carboxylate and histidine, two
carboxylates separated by a hydrophobic group, or Ala, or Gly, and the number of
DEDSE motifs (Figures 13D, S35B).
Of the 48 protein sequences of Set-A, only two lack any carboxylate-histidine
motif; 2 vs. 3 motifs are present in 26 vs. 13 sequences (Figure 13D). Since there
are significantly fewer His than Asp/Glu groups in a sequence (Figures S26A,
S26C), with a ratio between the number of His vs. Asp or Glu groups of ~0.15, the
propensity of carboxylate-histidine motifs in protein S sequences (Figure 13D)
suggests that histidine-carboxylate motifs are a conserved feature of protein S.
Motifs with two consecutive carboxylate groups appear relatively frequently, such
that 22 of the Set-A sequences have 8 - 9 such motifs (Figure 13D); the more
restrictive DELE or EELD, and EDDSE, motifs are present only once in 34 and 25
sequences, respectively (Figure 13D).
Taken together, the analysis of the carboxylate and carboxylate-histidine motifs
suggests that sequences of corona protein S contain patches in carboxylates, or
carboxylates and histidine groups, are located adjacent in the sequence.

Conclusions
Binding of the coronavirus protein S to the host ACE2 receptor initiates a series of
reactions that include large-scale structural rearrangements of protein S (Shulla and
Gallagher, 2009), changes in the structure and expression of the receptor, proteolitic
cleavage followed by conformational change thought to assist viral entry (Kam et al.,
2009), local dehydration and ordering of the membrane upon interaction with the
fusion peptide (Lai et al., 2017), and culminating with membrane fusion and virus
entry (Wang et al., 2020b). This is a highly complex reaction coordinate whose
description at the atomistic level of detail could facilitate the development of
therapeutics to prevent or treat viral infection.
As a first step towards deciphering interactions that govern structural plasticity of
SARS-CoV-2 protein S, here we focused on H-bonding and H-bond clusters, as Hbonding and H-bond clusters shape protein conformational dynamics (Bondar and
White, 2012; Joh et al., 2008), and H-bond networks are central to working models
of long-distance conformational couplings in proteins (Karathanou and Bondar,
2018b; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2019).
Clusters of H-bonds can be rather dynamic, with H-bonds that break and reform
rapidly, on the picosecond-nanosecond timescale; in a resting protein state, such
cluster(s) can contribute to the structural stability of the protein (Bondar and White,
2012). When the protein is perturbed, e.g., due to binding of an interaction partner,
dynamic H-bonds can shift population and help stabilize another conformation of the
protein (Bondar and White, 2012).
In the case of SARS-CoV-2 protein S, descriptions of conformational dynamics in
terms of H-bonds and H-bond networks are challenging due to the large size of the
protein (Figure 1), the presence of > 790 H-bonds in the ectodomain only (Figures
2A, 2B, 4, Table S1), and by that fact the protein S is subject to mutations that can
affect H-bonding groups (Table S8).
To tackle the challenge of dissecting H-bond networks in a system as large as
protein S, here we presented a methodology that relies on graphs (Schemes 1, 2).
We introduced measures to identify and catalogue H-bond clusters according to
their size, centrality values, density of clusters, and distribution of path lengths.

Closed vs. open or pre-fusion conformations of protein S have different
geometries of one of the RBDs, which in the open and pre-fusion conformations has
an up orientation, away from the remaining of the protein (Figures 1B, S1, S2).
Analyses presented here indicate that these three conformations are distinguished
by rearrangements of H-bond clusters at discrete sites of the protein, suggesting Hbond clusters play important roles in structural plasticity of protein S.
The RBDs of the closed conformation host a H-bond cluster centered at R509,
with the same groups contributing to the clusters of each protomer (Figures 7A, 14).
In the vicinity of the S1/S2 cleavage site, each protomer has a H-bond cluster
centered at D578 (Figures 7A, 14, S7A-C). Both the R509 and D578 clusters are
relatively large, with 8 and, respectively, 10 H-bonding groups in each protomer
(Figure 6D). Close to the stalk region of the ectodomain in closed conformation, the
same 11 groups of each protomers participate in the central cluster, in which the
core H-bond network of the E1031, S1037, and R1039 groups branches out via
H1048 to local networks centered at R905 (Figures 7A, 9A, 14).

by long-distance H-bond coupling across the interface. In the closed state of protein S, the
central R1039 cluster has three-fold symmetry, with the same 11 amino acid residues
contributed by each protomer. At the RBD, each protomer has relatively large R509 clusters
with the same composition; likewise, near the S1/S2 cleavage site, each protomer has a
D578 cluster contributed by the same groups. In the pre-fusion conformation, the R1039
central cluster rearranges drastically such that R1039 is part of protomer-pair interactions,
and the R509 and D578 clusters have altered topology. Groups of the R509 cluster hosted
by RBD-up can participate in an extended H-bond cluster at the ACE2 binding interface. In
ACE2, the interface H-bond network extends to the vicinity of the active-site. Protein S has
numerous carboxylate motifs, some of which we suggest could bind protons.

In the open and pre-fusion conformations, the R509, D578, R1039 clusters, and
other local clusters, have rearranged significantly. In the open conformation, the
central R1039 cluster separates into the central core and the R905 branches
(Figures 7C, 9B, 15, S13 B, F-H); in pre-fusion, R1039 is part of local H-bonding
between protomer pairs (Figures 9C-E). At the D578 site, H-bonding is largely
altered in one of the protomers of the open conformation, and in all three protomers
of the pre-fusion conformation (Figures 7C, 7E, 14, S7). Only one of the pre-fusion
RBDs, in the up conformation, has an H-bond cluster centered at R509 (Figures 7E,
8G, 8H, 14). This cluster includes N437 and N439 (Figure 8G), which are also part
of the H-bond cluster that contributes to the binding interface between protein S and
ACE2 (Figures 12, 14).
Thus, three major H-bond clusters of protein S, which in the closed conformation
are contributed by the same groups of each of the three protomers, rearrange
drastically in the open and pre-fusion conformation, and are distinct in each of the
conformers. Such structural rearrangement, whereby the three protomers of protein
S experience different H-bonding, could facilitate conformational selection of a
protomer for the binding to ACE2, and/or for proteolytic cleavage for activation.
In the case of the spike protein of HA, it is thought that a conformational change
occurs at low pH in the endosome (Millet and Whittaker, 2018), low pH facilitates the
transition of HA from the pre-fusion to the fusogenic conformation (Eckert and Kim,
2001), and the fusion peptide to approach the host membrane (Bullough et al.,
1998); two carboxylate groups contribute to a hydrophilic cavity in which the fusion
peptide folds (Colman and Lawrence, 2003). As the binding interface between
SARS-CoV-2 protein S and ACE2 carboxylate and histidine groups (Figure 12), and
protein S has patches of carboxylates (Figures 13, 14) we suggest local pH could

impact binding and local protein conformational dynamics. Patches of negatively
charged groups, potentially also with histidine, could have a proton antenna function
(Ädelroth and Brzezinski, 2004; Checover et al., 2001; del Val and Bondar, 2017;
Kemmler et al., 2019; Shutova et al., 2007).
The work presented here relied on static coordinate snapshots of protein S and of
protein S fragments bound to ACE2. In the near future, we anticipate that the
conformational dynamics of protein S could be described with a larger set of
experimentally solved structures, and/or with molecular dynamics simulations. The
methodology presented here enables efficient analyses of protein motions in terms
of location and topology of H-bond clusters for protein S, and is applicable to other
large protein complexes.
