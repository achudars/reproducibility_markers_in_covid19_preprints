Abstract

24

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute

25

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in

26

Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have

27

been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to

28

identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that

29

inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this

30

study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and

31

interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The

32

sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

33

compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to

34

interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that

35

SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies

36

used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein

37

and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the

38

binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by

39

antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may

40

have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that

41

F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide

42

crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-

43

CoV-2.

Introduction

49

Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped viruses which have a single strand, positive-stranded RNA genome and

50

classified into four genera: ɑ, β, γ, and δ. Coronavirus (CoV) has been identified in human and animals including

51

bats, camels, zpigs, cats, and mice. The viruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses

52

in human [1]. Two of betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

53

and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), caused severe epidemics during the

54

last two decades. SARS-CoV emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong province, China and affected 29

55

countries. The epidemic of SARS-CoV resulted in 8,096 human infections and 774 deaths (9.6% fatality rate) by

56

July 2003 [2]. MERS-CoV was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 and spread to 28 countries. The

57

epidemic of MERS-CoV resulted in 2,494 human infections and 858 deaths (34.4% fatality rate) by November

58

2019 [3].

59

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is newly emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe

60

Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previous known as 2019-nCoV) originated in

61

Wuhan seafood and animal market. In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause have been

62

reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [4]. Later, on January 7, a novel CoV was identified from the

63

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient [5], and named SARS-CoV-2 by International Committee on

64

Taxonomy of Viruses [6]. The early COVID-19 patients show symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection,

65

such as fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, muscle pain or malaise, and severe patients

66

develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or septic shock [7-9]. As of February 16, 2020, more than

67

69,200 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties [10].

68

The SARS-CoV-2 is a member of betacoronavirus and shows 79% and 50% sequence identity with

69

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is most similar

70

(88% sequence identity) to SARS-like CoVs previously collected from bats in China [5, 11, 12]. Although the

71

viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, most recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may use

72

angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a cellular entry receptor. ACE2 is a well known host cell receptor

73

for SARS-CoV [12]. Shi and colleges showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor but not

74

other CoV receptors, aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [13]. Ying and colleges

75

showed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) interacts with ACE2

76

[14]. McLaellen and colleges showed that ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein with much higher affinity than

77

to SARS-CoV S protein [15]. In addition, bioinformatic analysis proposed binding structure of RBD of S protein

78

(S-RBD) and ACE2 [16]. Thus, it is of great interest to identify neutralizing antibodies that can interact with

79

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and interfere with the binding between viral S protein and host receptor ACE2.

80

After the severe epidemic events of SARS and MERS, researchers have been made great efforts to

81

discover neutralizing antibodies for CoVs [17, 18]. The neutralizing antibodies for CoVs mainly targeted to S-

82

RBD. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows 76.2% and 34.1% amino acid sequence identity to those of SARS-CoV

83

and MERS-CoV, respectively. Therefore, the neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins

84

may have a possibility to interact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein and show similar viral neutralization effect. In the

85

present study, we employed a antibody-antigen docking approach to predict the interaction between SARS-CoV-

86

2 S-RBD and previously reported neutralization antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

87

Methods

89

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

90

To comparing of S gene containing S protein among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV strains, the

91

nucleotide sequences of S gene were retrieved from GISAID [19] and ViPR [20]. The S genes of SARS-CoV-2

92

were retrieved from initially sequenced 62 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. After removal of identical S gene

93

sequences, 16 genes of S protein were used in the study. The sequence from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1

94

(Genbank MN908947.3 or GISAID EPI ISL 402125) was used as a representative sequence of SARS-CoV-2

95

strains throughout this study. The closely related strains of SARS-CoV-2 were selected from preliminary and

96

extensive phylogenetic analaysis of SARS-CoV related strains including btSARS-CoV, SARS-CoV and a

97

MERS-CoV strain. More detail information of the sequences used in this study were listed in Supplementary

98

Table S1. The sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were done using MEGA X [21]. The nucleotide

99

sequence were codon aligned using ClustalW with default parameters and the phylogenetic tree was inferred

100

using neighbor-joining [22], maximum-likelihood [23], and maximum-parsimony methods [24]. The distance

101

matrix was calculated based on the Jukes-Cantor methods [25]. The bootstrap values of the phylogenetic tree

102

were derived from 1,000 replicates [26].

103
104

Conservation score and epitope mapping of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

105

The conservation score of amino acid positions on S protein in SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by ConSurf

106

program [27]. The multiple sequence alignment of SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1and 12 related strains

107

(Supplementary Table S1) was used as an input for ConSurf. In ConSurf, conservation scores and confidence

108

intervals for the conservation scores were calculated using the empirical Bayesian method. The scores were

109

normalized using the number of inputted sequences. Also, the highest score of ConSurf program means the most

110

conserved position among sequences. We additionally checked the epitope positions on the SARS-CoV-2 S

111

protein based on the known epitope information of 11 neutralizing antibodies developing for SARS-CoV and

112

MERS-CoV. Each information of epitope positions was acquired from literatures (Table 1).

113
114

Structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

115

S-RBD protein structure was used cryo-EM structure (Protein Data Bank ID : 6VSB) [15]. To predict the

116

missing region of cryo-EM structure in SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, we performed homology modeling based on

117

known the three dimensional structure of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6NB7) using SWISS-MODEL

118

(https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [28]. Then, the best homology models were selected according to Qualitative

119

Model Energy ANalysis (QMEAN) statistical parameter. The structures were visualized with UCSF’s Chimera

120

(https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).

121
122

Neutralizing antibody candidates

123

As neutralizing antibody candidates of SARS-CoV-2, the five antibodies against SARS-CoV and the six

124

antibodies to prevent MERS-CoV were selected in the study (Table 1). The complex structure of RBD and ten

125

neutralizing antibodies was retrieved from PDB. The complex structures were superimposed to the RBD

126

structure of SARS-CoV-2 which were built by homology modeling. The procedures were performed that the

127

RBD structures of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV were aligned by pairwise sequence alignment. And then the

128

structures were superimposed according to those pairwise alignments using MatchMaker program [29]. Finally,

129

we suceesfully predicted the complex structures of neutralizaing antibody candidates and RBD of SARS-CoV-2.

130

About the antibody such as CR3022 [30] that the structure was not revealed, we performed the antibody strcture

131

modeling with Rosetta program [31].

132
133

Antibody-antigen docking simulation

134

Docking simlutation between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and certain SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV antibodies

135

were implemented with Rosetta antibody-antigen docking protocols [32]. Rosetta SnugDock program can refine

136

homology models with the flexible and uncertain region, because the program simulates most of conformation

137

space available to antibody paratopes [33]. With the complex structures of RBD and antibody candidates, all-

138

atom relax protocol, docking prepack protocol, and antibody-antigen docking simulation were carried out to

139

calculate the free energy of low-energy binding conformations. The distiribution of docking scores displayed as

140

funnel plots using interface RMD (interface RMS) versus the binding score (dG binding) between antibody and

141

antigen (Fig. 4). The binding score was used Rosetta’s docking interface score (based on the Talaris2013 force

142

field) to rank the complexes. Rosetta interface score is defined as Isc = Ebound − Eunbound, where Ebound is

143

the score of the bound complex and Eunbound is the sum of the scores of the individual protein partners in

144

isolation. In addition, 1000 independent docking runs were performed to generate the antibody-antigen models.

145

To predict possible neutralizing antibody candidates of SARS-CoV-2, the docking results were compared

146

between interface binding scores of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (homology modeling) and interface binding scores of

147

SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S-RBD (crystal structure) with 11 antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have

148

been developed. The statistical significance was tested using student’s t-test.

Results and Discussion

151

Phylogenetic analysis and amino acid variation of S protein

152

The phylogenetic tree showed that the protein gene sequences were clearly clustered into three groups; SARS-

153

CoV-2 related, SARS-CoV related and HKU3 related groups (Fig. 1A). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 groups

154

formed a rigid monophyletic group with their own closest bat SARS-CoV related strains, respectively. The result

155

suggested that these two human-pathogenic CoV strains were derived from common ancestral bat CoV. The

156

sequence alignments showed that there were insertions and deletion during the divergence among the strains

157

(Fig. 1B and 1C). Various deletions were observed in SARS-CoV related group. The NTD region (position 71-

158

77, GTNGTKR) of S protein in the strain Wuhan-Hu-1 was mostly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 group but not in

159

SARS-CoV related group. The NTD region was also conserved in other btSARS-CoV strains but the sequence

160

similarity was low.

161

Interestingly, human pathogenic strains and their closest strains had two insertion sequences in RBD

162

region of SARS-CoV-2. The amino acid position 445-449 (VGGNY) and 470-486 (TEIYQAGSTPCNGVEGF)

163

were conserved in SARS-CoV-2 related group except bat-SL-CoVZC45 strain and the corresponding sequences

164

in SARS-related groups were ‘STGNY’ and ‘NVPFSPDGKPCTPPAL’ (Fig. 1C). The results could not give

165

clear answers that these insertion sequences had directly diverged from the common ancestor of SARS-CoV and

166

SARS-CoV-2 or that the sequences in SARS-CoV-2 were derived from SARS-CoV related group by mobile

167

genetic elements [34]. Nevertheless, the insertion sequences have several antibody epitope regions (Fig. 2) and

168

the two key residues (amino acid position 455 and 486) interacting with human ACE2 [35] which is used as a

169

cellular receptor of btSARS-CoV strain WIV1 [36]. This suggested that these sequence were might be related

170

with human susceptibility and virulence.

171
172

Identification and analysis of the neutralizing antibody epitopes

173

Previously, numbers of neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been developed [17, 18].

174

To suggest possible SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, monoclonal antibodies were selected from the

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.951178; this version posted February 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

175

literature and PDB (Table 1). Epitope map showed that the antibody-binding residues of S protein are located

176

within RDB region (Fig. 2). Four SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies had the epitopes about 5 to 14 residues

177

(total 34 residues, average 9.5 residues) of S-RBD and six MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies bound to 22 to 33

178

(total 52 residues, average 25 residues) residues. Distribution of the antibody-binding residues indicates that

179

SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies might be bind to mainly conformational epitopes of S-RDB, whereas MERS-

180

CoV neutralizing antibodies bound to linear epitopes of S-RBD (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the major linear epitope

181

region (EDGDYYRKQL) for MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies was specific insertion of MERS-CoV S

182

protein. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies interacted with three receptor binding residues (E536, D537, D539)

183

in the linear epitope region, which results in the neutralizing activity of antibodies by directly interferes the

184

binding between S protein and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 of human . In addition, the difference of binding aspect of

185

neutralizing antibodies might be caused by the difference of subdomain structure of receptor binding motif

186

(RBM). The RBM of SARS-CoV S protein is made of mainly coiled structure with two short β-sheets, whereas

187

the RBM of MERS-CoV S protein consists of four long β-sheets [37]. Sequence alignment revealed that RBD of

188

SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to that of SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV (Fig. 2). Therefore, this suggested that

189

SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies could be effective for SARS-CoV-2.

190
191

S-RBD structure modeling and superimposition of neutralizing antibodies

192

Human infection of SARS-CoV-2 was firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China last December [4].

193

Previous studies have reported several results for the interaction between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2

194

as a receptor [13, 14, 16, 38]. However, any interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with developed neutralizing

195

antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has not been reported yet. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

196

was used S protein which revealed by cryo electron microscopy structure. Subsequently, the missing region of

197

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD region comprising of 181 amino acids were built from SARS-CoV S proteins (PDB ID:

198

6NB7) which were good structural templates (Fig. 3 box). In the S-RBD structure, we also displayed

199

experimentally defined epitope information based on position specific aligment with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV

200

antibody binding epitopes.

201

To visualize the overall antibody binding region to SARS-CoV-2, we superimposed the predicted

202

structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein at the X-ray crystal structure of known antibody-antigen complex from

203

SARS and MERS (Fig. 3). The structures of five antibodies including m396, 80R, F26G19, S230, and CR3022

204

developing to prevent SARS-CoV were aligned on SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD successfully (Fig. 3A). The six MERS-

205

CoV antibodies such as MERS-27, CDC2-C2, m336, 4C2, D12, and MCA1 were also aligned on SARS-CoV-2

206

S-RBD (Fig. 3B). Because the X-ray crystal structure of CR3022 was not revealed, the optimized structure was

207

predicted using antibody homology modeling by 1000 structures generated using Rosetta program. As a results,

208

two SARS-CoV antibodies including CR3022 (-13.91 dG score) and F26G19 (-15.98 dG score) and MERS-CoV

209

D12 (-14.01 dG score) antibody had higher binding score than other antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

210

region. However, various MERS-CoV antibodies did not match SARS-CoV-2 because MERS-CoV antibodies

211

were interacted with the outter regon of S-RBD which was located in major linear epitope region

212

(EDGDYYRKQL) (Fig. 2).

213
214

Comparison of Antibody-RBD protein binding interaction

215

Based on antibody-antigen docking simulation, we calculated the binding scores between 11 antibodies and S-

216

RBD structures. The antibody-antigen docking simulation generated not only the crystal structures of SARS-

217

CoV and MERS-CoV S-RBD proteins, but also the high-quaility homology models with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

218

To suggest S-RBD binding antibody, antibody-RBD docking comparisons were performed using the mean value

219

of caculated scores from the generated models. The mean scores of the docking simulation are shown in Table 2.

220

Among the SARS-CoV antibodies, only CR3022 showed that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 was

221

higher than SARS-CoV. In addition, the docking score distribution of CR3022 was significantly changed

222

between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4). For the CR3022 antibody, the mean score of binding affinity

223

was increased from -11.21 dG score (SARS-CoV, crystal structure) to -13.91 dG score (SARS-CoV-2, cryo-EM

224

structure) with a p-value of 0.00367. The binding affinity of all antibody-antibgen docking was tested using

225

1000 generated structures. Interestingly, the CR3022 was experimentally performed for the binding effect of

226

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD [14]. The researchers found that the CR3022 had the binding effect anainst SARS-CoV-2

227

S-RBD and that m396 and m336 antibodies did not bind to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. The researchers also reported

228

that the binding affinity of CR3022 was increased to 6.28nM with SARS-CoV-2 from 0.125nM with SARS-

229

CoV, The results of the docking simulation were consistent with the evidence although more research was

230

needed to prevent effects, including an experiment using live viruses.

231
232

Conclusions

233

The fact that CoVs similar to SARS in Chinese bats is most identical to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that SARS-CoV

234

may have been originated from a common ancestral bat CoV. Comparing the sequences among the three groups,

235

various deletions were observed in the SARS-CoV related group. Especially, amino acid positions 71-77

236

(GTNGTKR) in the NTD region of the S protein, 445-449 (VGGNY) and 470-486 (TEIYQAGSTPCNGVEGF)

237

were noteworthy. The regions were highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2, unlike other SARS-CoVs.

238

Among the neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, CR3022 was predicted to have

239

better binding affinity to the S-RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 than other antibodies. The comparison of antibody

240

binding region between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was

241

conducted to apply the suitable diagnostic or therapeutic antibodies and vaccines that are mimetics of extremely

242

infectious SARS-CoV-2.

388

similarity of NTD domain region was the lowest among spike genes. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2_bat-RaTG13

389

had highly conserved in NTD domain than other SARS-CoVs. On the other hand, in the RBD region, not only

390

SARS-CoV but also SARS-CoV-2_bat-RaTG13 showed low sequence similarity. The lower panel indicates the

391

conservation score of the protein sequences of 27 SARS-CoV species. (C) Intersertional regions in SARS-CoV-2

392
