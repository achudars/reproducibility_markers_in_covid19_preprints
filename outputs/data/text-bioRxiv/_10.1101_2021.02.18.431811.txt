Summary

25

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 involves multiple organs including cardiovascular,

26

pulmonary and central nervous system. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection afflicts

27

diverse organ systems remains challenging1,2. Particularly vexing has been the problem

28

posed by persistent organ dysfunction known as “long COVID,” which includes cognitive

29

impairment3. Here we provide evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to activation of

30

TGF-β signaling and oxidative overload. One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine

31

receptor/calcium (Ca2+) release channels (RyR) on the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) reticuli

32

in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID-19. This depletes the

33

channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca2+ which can promote

34

heart failure4,5, pulmonary insufficiency

35

treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patients using a Rycal drug

36

(ARM210)10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak. Of particular interest is

37

that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in

38

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients7 were activated in COVID-19 patients. Thus, leaky

39

RyR2 Ca2+ channels may play a role in COVID-19 pathophysiology and could be a

40

therapeutic target for amelioration of some comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2

41

infection.

Patients suffering from COVID-19 exhibit multi-organ system failure involving not only

pulmonary

51

complexity of the organ system failures both complicate the care of COVID-19 patients, and

52

contribute to a great extent to the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic12. Clinical data13

53

indicate that severe COVID-19 most commonly manifests as viral pneumonia-induced acute

54

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure results from severe inflammation in

55

the lungs, which arises when COVID-19 infects lung cells and damages them. Cardiac

56

manifestations are multifactorial, and include hypoxia, hypotension, enhanced inflammatory

57

status, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation, endogenous

58

catecholamine adrenergic status, and direct viral myocardial damage14,15. Moreover, patients

59

with underlying cardiovascular disease or comorbidities, including congestive heart failure,

60

hypertension, diabetes, and pulmonary diseases, are more susceptible to infection by SARS-

61

CoV-2, with higher mortality14,15. In addition to respiratory and cardiac manifestation, it has been

62

reported that 36.4% of patients with COVID-19 develop neurological symptoms, including

63

headache, disturbed consciousness, and paresthesia

64

neuronal degeneration in deceased patients, and neuronal encephalitis have also been reported2,16-

65

and hypogeusia, the loss of the ability to smell and taste, respectively11,19. Interestingly,

67

hyposmia has been reported in early stage AD11 and Alzheimer type II astrocytosis has been

symptoms, manifestations, and complications reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection20,21, a

70

systematic study of COVID-19 brain neuropathology is still needed22.

71

Systemic failure in COVID-19 patients is likely due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion via the

72

ACE2 receptor17, which is highly expressed in pericytes of human heart23, epithelial cells of the

73

respiratory tract24, kidney, intestine, and blood vessels. ACE2 is also expressed in the brain,

74

especially in the brainstem, specifically the respiratory center and hypothalamus, the thermal

75

center, and cortex25, which renders these tissues more vulnerable to viral invasion. The primary

76

consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in

77

multiple organs and tissues26-28.

78

lymphocyte ratio observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is associated with excessive

79

levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that ROS induced tissue damage, contributing to

80

COVID-19 disease severity26. The impact of oxidative stress on calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, a

81

key determinant of cardiac function and rhythm29, as well as neuronal activity, remain to be

82

elucidated.

Recently it has been shown that the high neutrophil to

83

Recent studies have explored the relationship between ACE2 and TGF-β, demonstrating

84

the inverse relationship between the two. In cancer models, decreased levels of ACE2 correlated

85

with increased levels of TGF-β30. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, downregulation of

86

ACE2 has been observed, leading to increased fibrosis formation, as well as upregulation of

87

TGF-β and other inflammatory pathways31. Finally, patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms

88

had higher blood serum TGF-β concentrations than those with mild symptoms32, thus further

89

implicating the role of TGF-β in this disease and warranting further investigation on the topic.

pathways31. Interestingly, reduced angiotensin/ACE-2 activity has been associated with Tau

93

hyper-phosphorylation and increased amyloid-β pathology in animal models of Alzheimer

94

disease33,34. The link between reduced ACE2 activity and increased TGF-β and Tau signaling in

95

the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs further exploration.

Our laboratory has shown that stress-induced ryanodine receptor (RyR)/intracellular

A (PKA) hyper-phosphorylation related to activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the

99

resulting hyper-adrenergic state, deplete the channel stabilizing protein (calstabin) from the

100

channel complex, destabilizing the closed state of the channel causing it to leak in multiple

101

diseases6-9,29,35,36. Increased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activity can lead to RyR

102

modification and leaky channels37 and SR Ca2+ leak can cause mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and

103

dysfunction36. Increased TGF-β activity38 and mitochondrial dysfunction39 are also associated

104

with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

105

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with oxidative stress and

106

activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway in heart, lung and brain of patients who have

107

succumbed to COVID-19. One consequence is RyR oxidation, particularly through NADPH

108

oxidase 2 (NOX2), rendering the channels leaky to Ca2+ which may play a role in the

109

pathological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in heart, lung and brain. Moreover, the

110

hyper-adrenergic state observed in COVID-19 patients causes PKA hyper-phosphorylation of

111

RyR2 on Serine 2808, loss of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 from the channel complex and

112

leaky RyR2 channels in heart, lung, and brain. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection

113

activates biochemical pathways linked to the Tau pathology associated with AD and that leaky

Results

118

Oxidative stress and TGF-β activation

119

Oxidative stress was determined in heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patient

120

autopsy tissues and controls by measuring the ratio of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to

121

glutathione (GSH). COVID-19 patients exhibited significant oxidative stress with a 7.7, 13.6,

122

and 3.2-fold increase in GSSG/GSH ratios in heart, lung, and brain compared to controls

123

respectively (Figure 1A). In order to determine if SARS-CoV-2 infection also increases tissue

124

TGF-β activity, we measured SMAD3 phosphorylation, a downstream signal of TGFβ, in control

125

and COVID-19 tissue lysates (Figure 1B). Phosphorylated SMAD3 (pSMAD3) levels were

126

increased in COVID-19 heart, lung, and brain lysates compared to controls, indicating that

127

SARS-CoV-2 infection increased TGF-β signaling in these tissues. Interestingly, brain tissues

128

from COVID-19 patients exhibited activation of the TGF-β pathway, despite the absence of the

129

detectable (by immunohistochemistry and PCR, data not shown) virus in these tissues. These

130

results suggest that the TGF-β pathway is activated systemically by SARS-CoV-2 resulting in its

131

upregulation in brain as well as other organs.

132

RyR2 channel oxidation and leak

133

RyR channels may be oxidized as a consequence of activation of the TGF-β signaling

134

pathway37. NOX2 binding to RyR2 causes oxidation of the channel that activates the channel

manifested as an increased open probability. When the oxidization of the channel is at pathologic

142

The SMAD3 proteins involved in TGF-β signaling were shown to interact with the

143

nucleocapsid (N) protein in SARS-CoV138, interfering with healthy apoptotic pathways. As a

144

result, apoptosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected host cells is blocked and formation of tissue fibrosis is

145

promoted, especially in lung, thus contributing to the respiratory distress and subsequent

146

pulmonary failure associated with the disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection may also activate TGF-β

147

signaling through a direct interaction of the viral nucleocapsid protein (N protein) with SMAD3.

148

This direct interaction is shown in Figure 1D, which demonstrates that SMAD3 and SARS-

149

CoV-2 N protein co-immunoprecipitated from COVID-19 heart and lung lysates using

150

antibodies specific for either protein. The brain lysates used in this study did not contain

151

detectable (by immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting) SARS-CoV-2 N protein, indicating that

152

indirect effects of the inflammatory/oxidative response may be responsible for the alterations in

153

brain biochemistry observed in Figure 1.

154

Given the increased oxidative stress and increased NOX2 binding to RyR2 seen in

155

COVID-19 tissues, RyR2 post-translational modifications in these tissues were investigated.

156

Immunoprecipitated RyR2 from heart, lung, and brain lysates demonstrated increased oxidation,

157

PKA phosphorylation on Serine 2808, and depletion of the stabilizing protein subunit calstabin2

158

in SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues compared to controls (Figure 2A-C).

159

RyR channel activity was determined by binding of 3[H]ryanodine, which binds only to

160

the open state of the channel. RyR2 was immunoprecipitated from tissue lysates and ryanodine

161

binding to the immunoprecipitated was measured at both 150 nM and 20 μM free Ca2+. The total

162

amount of RyR immunoprecipitated was the same for control and COVID-19 samples

163

(immunoblots in Figure 2D). However, RyR2 channels from SARS-CoV-2 infected heart, lung,

164

and brain tissue demonstrate abnormally high activity compared to channels from control tissues

165

at physiologically resting conditions (150 nM free Ca2+), when channels should be closed (Figure

166

2D). This biochemical/functional remodeling of the channel results in what is known as “the

167

biochemical signature” of leaky RyR24,41 that destabilizes the closed state of the channel. This

168

leads to SR/ER chronic Ca2+ leak which contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases4-

169

7,9,37,42

170

leak, despite the persistence of the channel remodeling. Indeed, calstabin2 binding to RyR2 was

171

increased when COVID-19 patient heart, lung and brain tissue lysates were treated ex-vivo with

172

the Rycal drug ARM210 (Figure 2A-C). RyR2 activity at resting Ca2+ concentration was also

173

decreased by Rycal treatment (Figure 2D).

Ca2+ levels is upstream of both Tau and amyloid deposits in Alzheimer’s disease brains, and

could play an important role in the “brain fog” associated with COVID-19. Brain lysates from

182

COVID-19 patients’ autopsies demonstrated increased AMPK and GSK3ß phosphorylation

183

compared to controls (Figure 3A-B). Activation of these kinases in SARS-CoV-2 infected brain

184

leads to a hyper-phosphorylation of Tau similar to that observed in Alzheimer Tau pathology.

185

COVID-19 brain lysates showed increased Tau phosphorylation at S199 and S202/T205 (Figure

186

3A-B). We also observed an increased p25 expression, the neurotoxic activator of CDK5

187

(Figure 3C-D). CDK5 plays an important role in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in

188

AD. However, the increased p25/CDK5 observed in COVID-19 brain lysates did not activate

189

the amyloid beta pathway as no differences observed in BACE1 or BCTF levels between control

190

and COVID-19 brain lysates (Figure 3C-D).

191

Discussion

192

The molecular basis of how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects various tissues is not well

193

understood, and questions regarding the role of defective Ca2+ signaling in heart, lung, and brain

194

remain unanswered. In this study, we propose a potential mechanism that may contribute to

195

systemic organ failure caused by SARS-CoV-2: defective Ca2+ regulation and its downstream

196

signaling.

197

TGF-β belongs to a family of cytokines involved in the formation of cellular fibrosis by

198

promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, fibroblast proliferation, and differentiation43.

199

TGF-β activation has been shown to induce fibrosis in lung and other organs by activation of the

200

SMAD-dependent pathway. We have previously reported that TGF-β/SMAD3 activation leads to

201

NOX2/4 translocation to the cytosol and association with RyR channels promoting oxidization of

202

the channels and depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin in skeletal muscle and in heart 35,37.

203

Alteration of Ca2+ signaling may be particularly crucial in COVID-19 infected patients with

204

cardiovascular/neurological diseases due, in part, to the multifactorial RyR2 remodeling

205

following the cytokine storm, increased TGF-β activation, and increased oxidative stress.

206

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients exhibited increased endogenous adrenergic state,

207

which leads to hyper-phosphorylation of RyR2 channels, as observed in this study, promoting

208

pathological remodeling of the channel and exacerbating defective Ca2+ regulation that likely

209

result in cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias. In line with our observation, a recent study has

210

reported evidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy caused by a stroke and an acute COVID-19

211

induced sympathetic stimulation and catecholamines surge which has led to death44.

212

Conclusion

213

Our data indicate a role for leaky RyR2 in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection

214

(Figure 4). We show increased systemic oxidative stress and activation of the TGF-β signaling

215

pathway in lung, heart and brain of COVID-19 patients that correlates with oxidation-driven

216

biochemical remodeling of the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel (RyR2). This RyR2

217

remodeling results in intracellular calcium leak which can promote heart failure, pulmonary

218

insufficiency and cognitive dysfunction. Of particular interest is that leaky RyR2 channels in the

219

brain were associated with activation of neuropathological pathways that are also found in the

220

brains of Alzheimer’s Disease patients. Ex-vivo treatment of COVID-19 lung, heart and brain

221

using a Rycal drug (ARM210) that targets RyR2 channels prevented intracellular Ca2+ leak in

222

patient samples.

Figure 4. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in leaky RyR2 that may contribute to cardiac, pulmonary,
and cognitive dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection targets cells via the ACE2 receptor inducing
inflammasome stress response/activation of stress signaling pathways. This results in increased TGF-β
signaling, which activates SMAD3 (phosphoSMAD3, pSMAD), this increases NOX2 expression and the
amount of NOX2 associated with RyR2. Increased NOX2 activity at RyR2 oxidizes the channel causing
calstabin depletion from the channel macromolecular complex, destabilization of the closed state, and
ER/SR calcium leak that is known to contributes to cardiac dysfunction4,5, arrhythmias28, pulmonary
insufficiency6,8, and cognitive and behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodegenreation7,8. Rycal
drugs fix the RyR channel leak by restoring calstabin binding and stabilizing the channel closed state.
Fixing leaky RyR may improve cardiac, pulmonary and neural function in COVID-19.

420

Tissue lysates (0.1 mg) were treated with buffer or 10 µM Rycal (ARM210) at 4°C. RyR2 were

421

immunoprecipitated from 0.1 mg lung, heart and brain using an anti-RyR2 specific antibody (2

422

μg) in 0.5 ml of a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2,

423

0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mm NaF, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) overnight

424

at 4 °C. RyR2 specific antibody was an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody using the

425

peptide CKPEFNNHKDYAQEK corresponding to amino acids 1367-1380 of mouse RyR2 with

426

a cysteine residue added to the amino terminus. The immune complexes were incubated with

427

protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h, and the beads were washed three times with

428

radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The immunoprecipitates were size-fractionated on SDS-

429

PAGE gels (4-20 % for RyR2, calstabin and NOX2) and transferred onto nitrocellulose

430

membranes for 2 h at 200 mA. Immunoblots were developed using the following primary

431

antibodies: anti-RyR2 (Affinity Bioreagents, 1:2000), anti-phospho-RyR-Ser(P)-2808 (Affinity

432

Bioreagents 1:5000), anti-calstabin (FKBP12 C-19, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,

433

Santa Cruz, CA), anti NOX2 (Abcam, 1:1000). To determine channel oxidation, the carbonyl

434

groups in the protein side chains were derivatized to DNP by reaction with 2,4-

435

dinitrophenylhydrazine. The DNP signal associated with RyR was determined using a specific

436

anti-DNP antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA). All

437

immunoblots were developed and quantified using an Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences,

438

Lincoln, NE) with IR-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (1: 10,000 dilution) secondary

439

antibodies.

440

Ryanodine Binding

441

RyR2 were immunoprecipitated from 1.5 mg of tissue lysate using an anti-RyR2 specific

442

antibody (25 μg) in 1.0 ml of a modified RIPA buffer overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes

443

were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h, and the beads were

444

washed three times with RIPA buffer, followed by 2 washes with ryanodine binding buffer (10

445

mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 M NaCl, 1 % CHAPS, 5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, and protease

446

inhibitors). Immunoprecipitates were incubated in 0.2 ml of binding buffer containing 20 nM

447

[3H] ryanodine and either of 150 nM and 20 μm free Ca2+ for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were diluted

448

with 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 0.25 m KCl) and filtered through

449

Whatman GF/B membrane filters pre-soaked with 1% polyethyleneimine in washing buffer.

450

Filters were washed three times with 5ml of washing buffer. The radioactivity remaining on the

451

filters is determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H] ryanodine. Nonspecific

452

binding was determined in the presence of 1000-fold excess of non-labeled ryanodine.

453

GSSH/GSH ratio measurement and SMAD3 phosphorylation

454

Approximately 20 mg of suspended in 200 µL of ice-cold PBS/0.5% NP-40, pH6.0 for lysis.

455

Tissue is homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer with 10 – 15 passes.

456

centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C to remove any insoluble material. Supernatant is

457

transferred to a clean tube. Deproteinizing of the samples is accomplished by adding 1 volume

458

ice cold 100% (w/v) TCA into 5 volumes of sample and vortexing briefly to mix well. After

459

incubating for 5 min on ice, samples are centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C and the

460

supernatant is transferred to a fresh tube. The samples are neutralized by adding NaHCO3 to

461

supernatant and vortexing briefly. Samples are centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C

462

and supernatant is collected. Samples are now deproteinized, neutralized, and TCA has been

463

removed. The samples are ready to use in the assay. The GSSG/GSH is determined using the

464

ratio detection assay kit (Abcam, ab138881). Briefly, in two separate assay reactions, GSH

465

(reduced) is measured directly with a GSH standard and Total GSH (GSH + GSSG) is measured

466

by using a GSSG standard. A 96 well plate is set up with 50 µL duplicate samples and standards

467

with known concentrations of GSH and GSSG. A Thiol green indicator is added and the plate is

468

incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Fluorescence at Ex/Em = 490/520 nm is measured

469

with a fluorescence microplate reader, and the GSSG/GSH for samples are determined

470

comparing fluorescence signal of samples with known standards.
