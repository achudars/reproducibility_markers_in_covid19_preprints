Abstract
Heterogeneous immunoassays such as ELISA have become indispensable in modern bioanalysis, yet
translation into easy-to-use point-of-care assays is hindered by their dependence on external calibration and
multiple washing and incubation steps. Here, we introduce RAPPID (Ratiometric Plug-and-Play
Immunodiagnostics), a “mix-and-measure” homogeneous immunoassay platform that combines highly
specific antibody-based detection with a ratiometric bioluminescent readout that can be detected using a
basic digital camera. The concept entails analyte-induced complementation of split NanoLuc luciferase
fragments, photoconjugated to an antibody sandwich pair via protein G adapters. We also introduce the use
of a calibrator luciferase that provides a robust ratiometric signal, allowing direct in-sample calibration and
quantitative measurements in complex media such as blood plasma. We developed RAPPID sensors that allow
low-picomolar detection of several protein biomarkers, anti-drug antibodies, therapeutic antibodies, and
both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RAPPID combines ratiometric bioluminescent
detection with antibody-based target recognition into an easy-to-implement standardized workflow, and
therefore represents an attractive, fast, and low-cost alternative to traditional immunoassays, both in an
academic setting and in clinical laboratories for point-of-care applications.

Introduction
The widely recognized need for more personalized, patient-centered healthcare has urged the development of
cheap, easy-to-use, yet reliable biomolecular diagnostics. Such technology would not only accelerate
biomolecular research in academic and clinical environments, but also allow for fast diagnostic decision making
when access to clinical laboratories is unavailable or cost-prohibitive. Affinity-based immunoassays, such as
ELISA and other heterogeneous immunoassays, form the cornerstone of today’s clinical bioanalytical toolbox
and offer both the specificity required to minimize crosstalk and the modularity to allow application to a broad
range of clinically relevant analytes. Translation of these immunoassays into point-of-care applications has
proven challenging, due to the requirement of multiple washing and incubation steps, external calibration and
time-consuming optimization of sensor surface immobilization and assay conditions1. Lateral flow
immunoassays (LFIAs) have been introduced as cheap and relatively easy-to-use point-of-care tests, but they
suffer from limited sensitivity and are primarily used as qualitative tests2,3.

Single-step affinity-based detection assays performed directly in solution would not only speed up traditional
laboratory immunoassays, but would also be particularly attractive for point-of-care testing outside of the
laboratory setting by non-expert users4,5. Several promising optical biosensor platforms have been reported that
translate analyte binding directly into a conformational change, resulting in a change of signal intensity or
color6,7. Of these, sensors based on bioluminescence are particularly suited for measurements directly in
complex media such as blood with minimal sample handling, as they do not require external excitation and
therefore do not suffer from issues related to autofluorescence or light scattering8,9. The Johnsson lab pioneered
the development of semisynthetic sensor proteins based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)
for the detection of small-molecule drugs such as methotrexate and digoxin, and important metabolites such as
NAD+ and NADPH10–13. Alternatively, the LUMABS platform was developed to enable detection of specific
antibodies directly in blood plasma with the use of a smartphone camera14–17. Both sensor platforms employ
ratiometric bioluminescent detection, which allows quantitative measurements and enables integration in
paper- and thread-based analytical devices for low-cost point-of-care detection11,18,19. Although LUCID and
LUMABS have a modular architecture, successful sensor development requires the availability of suitable ligandbinding domains and ligand analogs, or specific epitope peptides or mini-protein domains20,21, respectively.
Moreover, while extensive protein engineering has yielded sensors with a greater than 10-fold change in
emission ratio13, the dynamic range of BRET sensors is typically 2-4 fold14,17.
Here, we present RAPPID (Ratiometric Plug-and-Play Immunodiagnostics) as a new, comprehensive platform of
ratiometric bioluminescent sensors that can be readily adopted to suit a broad range of biomolecular targets.
RAPPID is based on the complementation of antibody-conjugated split NanoLuc luciferases22,23 to detect the
formation of a sandwich immunocomplex in solution with a high intrinsic signal-to-background output (Fig. 1a).
Although methods for the generation of antibody-split luciferase fusion proteins are available, they are based
on non-specific conjugation or cumbersome recombinant expression of antibody fusions13,24. RAPPID does not
require additional protein engineering and uses protein G-mediated photoconjugation to generate well-defined
antibody conjugates directly from commercially available antibodies25,26. Additionally, we introduce a green
light-emitting calibrator luciferase as a simple method to provide a robust blue-over-green ratiometric readout
and direct internal calibration. The ratiometric signal of RAPPID sensors is stable over time and less sensitive to
experimental conditions and substrate concentration, enabling us to effectively address this fundamental
problem of intensiometric bioluminescent assays.
Development and implementation of a RAPPID assay for a new biomolecular target is straightforward and
consists of three steps: 1) the selection of a pair of (commercial) antibodies that bind the target analyte, 2)
crosslinking of the antibodies to the protein G-luciferase adapters using a simple one-hour illumination protocol,
and 3) addition of both antibody-luciferase conjugates, the calibrator luciferase and the Nanoluc substrate to
the sample, followed by detection of the emission ratio of blue over green light (Fig. 1a). The ratiometric
luminescent signal can be recorded with a standard digital camera, obviating the need for additional high-tech,
expensive equipment. Here, the broad scope and excellent analytical performance of RAPPID is demonstrated
by developing assays for a range of clinically relevant biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I, C-reactive protein,
three anti-drug-antibodies, and two therapeutic antibodies, displaying robust, up to 36-fold increases in
emission ratio. Finally, we demonstrate that the modularity of the RAPPID workflow enables prompt
development of novel immunoassays for emerging target analytes such as SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Results

Figure 1 | General overview and design elements of the RAPPID sensor platform. a, Schematic representation of the concept of antigen
detection using a RAPPID sensor. A pair of primary antibodies is functionalized with a split version of the NanoLuc luciferase (Large BiT
and Small BiT, respectively) through use of protein G-based photoconjugation. Antigen binding induces co-localization of the antibody
pair and subsequent reconstitution of NanoLuc, resulting in the emission of blue light upon conversion of substrate (furimazine; λmax~460
nm). Ratiometric detection is achieved by addition of a calibrator luciferase, consisting of a tight fusion of NanoLuc to fluorescent acceptor
mNeonGreen, which produces a green signal (λmax~520 nm) upon substrate conversion through bioluminescent resonance energy
transfer (BRET). The homogeneous solution-based assay is conducted by mixing the sample and sensor components with the NanoLuc
substrate and recording the emission spectrum. In the absence of antigen (left) no split complementation occurs resulting in
predominantly green emission from the calibrator luciferase (low blue/green ratio), while the presence of antigen (right) results in
NanoLuc reconstitution and an increase in blue-light emission (high blue/green ratio). b, Schematic overview of the antibody conjugation
method. Fusion between the adapter protein G carrying the photoreactive non-natural amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine and either
Large BiT or Small BiT (Gx-LB and Gx-SB, respectively) enables covalent coupling to the constant Fc-binding domain of most IgG-type
antibodies, including all human IgGs, by exposure to long-wavelength UV light (λ=365 nm). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the
photoconjugation reaction (Rxn.) illustrates successful coupling of primary antibody (Ab., 10 µM) to either one (indicated with 1×) or two
(2×) protein G adapters (10 µM). Reactions were performed in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 hr on ice. Subsequent small-scale Ni2+-affinity
chromatography removed unconjugated antibody (FT, flow through) resulting in pure antibody conjugates (Pur.).

Sensor design and characterization
To establish a universally applicable sensing platform, we employed protein G-based photoconjugation for the
synthesis of sensor components directly from commercially available primary antibodies. Both the 18-kDa Large
BiT (LB) and the 1.3-kDa Small BiT (SB) fragment of split NanoLuc were genetically fused via a semi-rigid peptide
linker to a protein G adapter domain (Gx), carrying the photocrosslinkable non-natural amino acid pbenzoylphenylalanine (Gx-LB and Gx-SB, respectively, see Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 5). Expression was
performed in Escherichia coli with amber codon suppression using an engineered orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA
synthetase/tRNA pair27,28, which afforded Gx-LB and Gx-SB in high yields after affinity chromatography
purification (respectively ~18 mg/L and ~5 mg/L, see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6). Next, antibody
conjugation was performed by illuminating reaction mixtures with long-wavelength UV light (λ=365 nm) in
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 1 hr on ice, covalently crosslinking Gx-LB and Gx-SB to the Fc-domain of
the antibody. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a mixture of mono-conjugated, bi-conjugated and non-conjugated
antibodies (Fig. 1b). Although the conjugation efficiency can be further improved by increasing the relative
concentration of Gx-LB and Gx-SB, we chose to use an equal molar ratio of protein to antibody to minimize the
presence of non-conjugated Gx-LB and Gx-SB, which could contribute to non-specific background
complementation. If necessary, non-conjugated antibodies can be removed by small-scale Ni2+-affinity
chromatography, targeting the N-terminal polyhistidine tag of Gx-LB and Gx-SB (Fig. 1b). Since protein G binds
to the majority of IgG-type antibodies, including all human and many other mammalian isotypes, this approach

offers a general method for the rapid synthesis of antibody-luciferase conjugates from commercially available
antibodies.

To establish proof of principle and characterize the performance of the RAPPID sensor platform, we first
developed a sensor targeting cardiac troponin I (cTnI), an important protein biomarker for myocardial injury that
requires highly sensitive detection at picomolar concentrations (Fig. 2a)29. To this end, Gx-LB and Gx-SB were
photoconjugated to a pair of commercially available anti-cTnI antibodies with distinct binding epitopes (19C7
(mIgG2b) and 4C2 (mIgG2a), respectively, Fig. 1b). Subsequently, increasing concentrations of cTnI were added
to a reaction mixture consisting of 1 nM of both antibody-luciferase components and incubated for 30 min at
room temperature followed by the addition of NanoLuc substrate. A maximal 281-fold increase in luminescence

intensity was observed upon addition of cTnI, with a detection regime spanning four orders of magnitude and a
limit of detection of 4.2 pM (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). The luminescent output follows a bell-shaped
dose-response curve, as evidenced by a decrease in signal at cTnI concentrations >10 nM (Fig. 2b). This ‘hook’
effect is well-known and occurs because at high target concentrations formation of inactive binary complexes is
favored over the formation of the enzymatically active ternary complex30,31. These initial results demonstrate
that target binding effectively stimulates NanoLuc complementation, resulting in a sensitive bioluminescent
signal output with a high signal-to-background ratio.
To provide a means for understanding and tuning the response characteristics of the RAPPID sensor, we
developed a thermodynamic model that analyzes the equilibria involved in target-induced formation of the
luminescent ternary complex (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). We investigated critical
parameters that can be used to modulate the sensor response and performed nonlinear fitting of the
experimental data to the model (Fig. 2b).. The model predicts that sensor sensitivity and response are strongly
dependent on the antibody affinities and that the detection regime can be tuned by varying the concentrations
of antibody-luciferase conjugates (Supplementary Fig. 3a, 3c). We confirmed the latter predictions by
performing RAPPID assays at sensor component concentrations of 10, 1, and 0.1 nM respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 8). An additional parameter that affects sensor performance is the intrinsic affinity between
split NanoLuc components LB and SB. As predicted by the model, attenuating the interaction between LB and
SB from Kd = 2.5 µM to Kd = 190 µM does not allow effective luciferase complementation in the sandwich
complex. Experimentally, increasing the strength of the interaction (Kd = 0.28 µM) does not enhance luciferase
complementation much further in the presence of the analyte, but does results in a higher background signal in
the absence of analyte and therefore a smaller dynamic range (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These observations
indicate that the thermodynamic model can inform the behavior of RAPPID sensors and facilitate rational design
of their molecular characteristics.
An inherent property of intensiometric luciferase assays is depletion of the substrate over time and a concurrent
decrease in absolute signal intensity, which hampers reproducibility and prohibits quantitative measurements.
This is especially problematic for point-of-care applications, where it is often difficult to calibrate the assay and
compensate for variations in substrate concentration, as well as environmental conditions such as pH,
temperature and ionic strength. We hypothesized that a calibrator luciferase based on NanoLuc, but with a
shifted emission maximum, could be added to the sample together with the sensor components to provide a
direct internal calibration by ratiometrically comparing two different emission wavelengths. To construct the
calibrator luciferase, we fused NanoLuc to the green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (mNG-NL), resulting in
green luminescent emission (λmax~520 nm) due to efficient BRET from NanoLuc to the fluorescent acceptor
mNeonGreen32. The calibrator was added to the cTnI sensor mixture at a final concentration of 2 pM, after which
luminescent spectra were recorded at various cTnI concentrations (Fig. 2c). In contrast to intensiometric
detection, where the luminescent signal quickly reached a maximum and then decayed, the ratiometric signal
was stable over a prolonged period of time (Fig. 2d). A similar dose response was observed, with a maximal
signal at 10 nM cTnI and a limit of detection of approximately 19 pM (compare Fig. 2b and 2e). Although the
dynamic range is lower than in the intensiometric assay due to spectral overlap between blue and green
emission, the >25-fold change in emission ratio is greater than those typically seen in BRET-based sensor
platforms10,15. In addition, the calibrator concentration can be adjusted in order to obtain an optimal response
at the desired detection regime of the analyte (Supplementary Fig. 10).
We also applied the ratiometric nature of the RAPPID sensor to facilitate straightforward signal recording with
a digital camera and used the high intrinsic dynamic range to perform measurements directly in blood plasma.
Using identical reaction conditions as described for Fig. 2c, the cTnI concentration-dependent color change from
blue to green was clearly observed in images recorded with a standard digital camera (Fig. 2f). The emission
ratios were calculated from the blue- and green-color channels of the RGB image and showed a similar dose
response as in the plate reader assay, with a linear correlation for cTnI concentrations ≤1 nM (Fig. 2e and 2g).
Additionally, we assessed sensor performance in human blood plasma. The luminescent output signal was
substantially suppressed in 100% plasma, which can be partially attributed to absorption of blue light by

hemoglobin and biliverdin (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 11)33,34. Nevertheless, the high intrinsic sensitivity of
the RAPPID sensor still enabled ratiometric detection, with a reliable 5-fold change in emission ratio in 20%
blood plasma (Fig. 2h). These results establish the RAPPID sensor platform as a robust ratiometric detection
method with a large intrinsic dynamic range. As a result, one-step in-solution measurements can be performed
in clinically relevant media such as blood plasma, while facile signal recording with a digital camera should enable
rapid diagnostic testing at the point of care.

Modularity and versatility of RAPPID
To demonstrate that the RAPPID workflow can be implemented for alternative targets, we next developed a
sensor for C-reactive protein (CRP), a pentameric protein with clinical relevance as an inflammatory marker in
cardiovascular disease35, COPD36 and other diseases (Fig. 3a). Two anti-CRP antibodies (C135 and C6) were
photoconjugated to Gx-LB or Gx-SB, respectively, using similar conditions as described for cTnI, and SDS-PAGE
was used to confirm efficient conjugation and purification (Supplementary Fig. 12). Using 1 nM of C6-LB, 10 nM
C135-SB and 2 pM calibrator luciferase, an 18-fold increase in emission ratio was observed when varying the
CRP concentration in the pM–nM regime, with an LOD of 2.9 pM (Fig. 3b). We then benchmarked the analytical
performance of RAPPID to ELISA, which is the current golden standard in hospitals and diagnostic centers for
detecting CRP in cardiovascular risk assessment at low mg L-1 levels in human blood plasma (approximately 8–
80 nM)37,38. A linear correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.9906) was observed between CRP concentrations as determined
by ELISA and RAPPID (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 13), confirming the accuracy of our CRP sensor. The high
sensitivity of RAPPID allowed a 50-fold dilution of plasma samples, thereby mitigating possible interference from
matrix effects. In addition, the “mix-and-measure” workflow eliminates the need for multiple wash steps and
thus substantially reduces total assay time.
After validating the modularity of RAPPID, we sought to demonstrate that our platform is suited for the rapid
development of sensors for newly emerging targets. Containment of the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused
by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, urgently requires strategies for fast, low-cost, point-of-care viral detection, as no
effective drug or vaccine is yet available39–42. Two recently reported monoclonal antibodies that target the
immunogenic spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus allowed us to develop RAPPID sensors for viral antigen
detection. The antibodies (47D11 and 49F1) bind distinct epitopes on the spike protein which natively exists as
a trimer. We constructed two sensor variants, using either both antibodies (heteropair, 47D11-LB with 49F1-SB)
or only a single antibody (homopair, 47D11-LB with 47D11-SB) and directly utilized them for sensing the spike
protein without further purification (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 14). To scavenge non-conjugated Gx-LB and
Gx-SB and consequently reduce the background signal in absence of the analyte, we added an excess of nonbinding IgG to the assay solution. We hypothesized that we could differentiate between the monomeric and
trimeric state of the spike protein, the latter being more likely to represent the active virus, by comparing the
heteropair and homopair sensor response. Indeed, only the heteropair sensor variant, in which the antibodyluciferase conjugates are able to bind to distinct epitopes, exhibited a dose response to monomeric spike
protein, while no response was observed when using the homopair (Fig. 3e). Both sensor variants showed a
concentration-dependent increase in emission ratio in response to the spike protein trimer, with a detection
regime ranging between 1 nM and 100 nM (Fig. 3f). Model simulations suggest that the sensitivity could be
further improved by using antibodies with higher affinities (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Indeed, when performing
similar tests using commercially available anti-spike antibodies with higher affinities, the LOD could be
decreased by almost an order of magnitude, between 0.2 and 0.3 nM (Supplementary Fig. 15 and
Supplementary Fig. 16, Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these results illustrate the potential of RAPPID
for on-demand development of new biosensors as soon as antibodies become available, and the ability of the
platform to distinguish between oligomeric states of proteins.

In b,e,f, individual data points are represented as circles and dashed lines connect mean values.

Antibody detection using RAPPID
The RAPPID platform also provides new assay formats for the detection of clinically relevant antibodies. Our
previously developed LUMABS BRET sensor platform allows sensitive and quantitative detection of specific
antibodies, but requires the genetic incorporation of well-defined, high affinity epitopes or mimitopes, which
are not always available14. Here, we used the RAPPID platform to detect clinically relevant antibodies with
complex, discontinuous epitopes and for the detection of heterogeneous antibody responses. We first
developed sensors for anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs), which are raised by the immune system against therapeutic
antibodies upon repeated administration and are a main reason for rapid clearance45. We utilized our
photoconjugation strategy to directly couple both Gx-LB and Gx-SB to three important clinical therapeutic
antibodies: cetuximab which targets EGFR and is used for colorectal cancer treatment46, and adalimumab and
infliximab which target TNFα and are prescribed for a variety of autoimmune diseases47 (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 17). Similar dose-response curves were obtained for all three ADAs (Fig. 4b). Because both
antibody-luciferase conjugates contain the same antibody that binds to the bivalent ADA target, a statistical
mixture containing a fraction of non-luminescent ternary complexes is expected to form. Despite this, the
RAPPID sensors exhibited a robust change in emission of 5–6-fold, and LODs between 59–81 pM (Supplementary
Table 1).

Next, we applied RAPPID to detect antibodies that bind structurally complex, discontinuous epitopes, employing
it to monitor therapeutic antibodies that target the TNFα homotrimer as a proof of concept47. TNFα-binding
therapeutic antibodies, such as adalimumab and infliximab, are widely administered anti-inflammatory drugs
for the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis48 and inflammatory bowel disease49. Therapeutic drug
monitoring (TDM) of these antibodies is important in the clinic to achieve optimal treatment efficiencies and to
reduce possible side effects. To overcome the issue of creating non-productive complexes as described above
for the ADA sensors, we adapted the RAPPID format by introducing a TNFα-SB fusion protein and a Gx-LBphotoconjugated type-2 anti-antibody, binding to the therapeutic antibody, or a type-3 anti-antibody, binding
to the complex of the target therapeutic antibody and TNFα (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 18). Because of the
relatively high therapeutic window of adalimumab and infliximab50,51, assays were performed using higher
sensor concentrations (10 nM anti-antibody-LB and 100 nM TNFα-SB). As a result, we observed high substate
turnover and a quick decrease in luminescence intensity within a few minutes after adding the NanoLuc
substrate (Fig. 4d). Addition of the calibrator luciferase was therefore critical to allow accurate, timeindependent antibody quantification. Robust changes in emission ratio in the therapeutically relevant
concentration range for both adalimumab and infliximab were detected directly in 10–17% blood plasma using
either a plate reader or a digital camera (Fig. 4e), demonstrating the ability of RAPPID sensors to accurately
measure concentrations of antibodies in complex media.
The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 warrants for the development of serological assays that can be
used as a tool to evaluate the extent of viral infection in the population and assess the efficacy of potential
vaccine candidates. As such, we next aimed to develop a RAPPID variant for the detection of antibodies against
the SARS-CoV-2 virus52,53. To enable the detection of a wide panel of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we adapted
the RAPPID sensor by introducing the immunogenic receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein54, fused to either SB or LB (Fig. 4f). The bivalent nature of antibodies promotes the complementation of
LB with SB, hence producing a bioluminescent signal upon RBD-LB and RBD-SB binding. After successful
expression of RBD-LB and RBD-SB in HEK293T cells and subsequent purification (Supplementary Fig. 19), the
sensor was assessed for its ability to detect three different anti-RBD antibodies: a recently discovered
neutralizing antibody (47D11) and a commercially available ELISA pair (D001 and D003). Fig. 4g depicts the
RAPPID response curves of these antibodies, with LODs of 106 pM, 16 pM and 4 pM for 47D11, D001, and D003,
respectively, and a maximal change in emission ratio of 36-fold. As expected, an antibody (49F1) that binds the
spike protein outside the RBD44, did not induce a sensor response (Supplementary Fig. 20). A similar approach
based on intensiometric detection of split NanoLuc complementation was recently published as a preprint55, but
the ratiometric detection enabled by the RAPPID assay is preferred for quantitative measurements, which are
important when studying the time-dependence of the antibody response and the correlation between antibody
titers and immunological protection56,57. Collectively, these results illustrate that the RAPPID platform is highly
versatile and can be reengineered to suit a variety of applications related to antibody detection, including
quantitative measurements of antibodies that bind discontinuous epitopes, therapeutic antibodies and their
ADAs, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Conclusion and discussion
Protein-based biosensors that generate a luminescent signal upon binding of a biomolecular target are attractive
bioanalytical tools because they 1) enable highly sensitive detection based on enzymatic amplification, and 2)
do not require external excitation, which renders them ideal for direct homogeneous detection in complex
samples. In this study, we have established a new comprehensive sensor platform based on antibody-guided
split NanoLuc complementation combined with a robust ratiometric output. The RAPPID platform is highly
modular and broadly applicable as it allows the use of commercially available monoclonal antibodies as
recognition elements. The required protein G-split NanoLuc fusion proteins are easily expressed in E. coli and
obtained using standard affinity purification, while antibody conjugation is based on a one-hour illumination
protocol that does not require expert laboratory equipment. Performing a RAPPID assay entails single-step
mixing of the target analyte with the two antibody-luciferase components and the calibrator luciferase, after
which NanoLuc substrate is added to initiate signal generation. The ratiometric readout can be recorded in
minutes as a blue-to-green color change using a standard digital camera.
Combining these design aspects allowed the formulation of a straightforward workflow for developing insolution immunoassays with low pM sensitivity, a large dynamic range and excellent reproducibility for any
relevant target, depending only on the availability of a suitable pair of antibodies. Sensors for traditional
biomarkers such as cardiac troponin I and C-reactive protein, as well as newly emerging targets such as the SARSCoV-2 virus, could be developed within days after antibody arrival. Depending on the affinity of the antibodies
and the target architecture, robust changes in emission ratio ranging from 5 (for ADAs) to 25 were routinely
obtained, which is substantially higher than typical BRET-based biosensors. Moreover, the sensor’s responsive
range can be rationally adjusted to a specific application by varying the concentration of the antibody conjugates
and the concentration of the calibrator luciferase. The platform is versatile by design, which allowed us to create
multi-faceted detection assays, for example for measuring both therapeutic antibodies and their anti-drugantibodies, as well as both SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies. Furthermore, strategic selection of the
antibodies can facilitate elucidation of structural features of the target analyte, which could aid in distinguishing
between functional and non-functional molecular configurations, for instance when considering the
oligomerization state of proteins.
An important aspect of the RAPPID platform is direct in-sample calibration by addition of a calibrator luciferase,
that contains an identical luciferase domain but with a spectrally distinct emission profile. Although the
ratiometric response is smaller than the intensiometric response, the ratiometric signal is stable over time and
less susceptible to experimental variation. We envision that the use of a calibrator luciferase can be applied as
a general strategy to translate intensiometric luminescent assays into robust ratiometric assays with a timeindependent and quantitative assay output. As such, other recently developed intensiometric sensors based on
split luciferase complementation could benefit from a calibrator luciferase to further enhance their potential in
a clinically relevant environment21,55. Furthermore, the concept can be extended by using different acceptor
domains, such as quantum dots, organic fluorophores or fluorescent protein domains, with a larger spectral
separation from the blue light-emitting NanoLuc.
In conclusion, RAPPID represents a highly attractive assay format for point-of-care diagnostics, as it combines
the analytical performance of a laboratory-based immunoassay such as ELISA with the speed and ease-of-use of
lateral flow immunoassays. To allow further development for point-of-care diagnostic applications, RAPPID
could be integrated in cheap and simple paper- or thread-based analytical devices or microfluidic cartridges,
while dedicated readers could be developed to further increase sensitivity. The availability of such integrated
devices and the ability to develop a RAPPID assay for a new target analyte only within days, makes RAPPID an
attractive immunoassay format for a broad spectrum of applications, including rapid screening methods,
therapeutic antibody drug monitoring, and the rapid detection of infectious diseases to be better prepared for
future pandemics.

Methods
Cloning
The pET28a(+) vectors containing DNA encoding for Gx-SB, Gx-LB, mNG-NL and SUMO-TNFα-SB were ordered
from GenScript. The sequence of mNG-NL was reported by Suzuki et al32, and a His-tag at the N-terminus and a
Strep-tag at the C-terminus were included to facilitate purification26. Site-directed mutagenesis to change SB
sequences was carried out using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent technologies)
and specifically designed primers.
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (produced under
HHSN272201400008C and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Vector pCAGGS Containing the SARSRelated Coronavirus 2, Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), NR-52309) was
genetically fused to either the LB or SB via a semi-flexible linker and subsequently cloned into the pHR-CMVTetO2_3C-mVenus-Twin-Strep plasmid, a gift from A. Radu Aricescu (Addgene plasmid #113891)58, by means of
restriction-ligation approach.
All cloning and mutagenesis results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (BaseClear). The DNA and amino acid
sequences of the fusion proteins are listed in supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 21-26).

Protein expression
The pET28a plasmid encoding for either Gx-LB or Gx-SB was co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) together with
a pEVOL vector encoding a tRNA/tRNA synthetase pair in order to incorporate para-benzoyl-phenylalanine
(pBPA)27. The pEVOL vector was a gift from Peter Schultz (Addgene plasmid # 31186). Cells were cultured in 2YT
medium (16 g peptone, 5 g NaCl, 10 g yeast extract per liter) containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 25 μg/mL
chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced using 0.1 mM IPTG and 0.2% arabinose in the presence of 1
mM pBPA (Bachem, F-2800.0001). Following overnight expression at 20 oC, cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min and lysed using the Bugbuster reagent (Novagen) and Benzonase
(Novagen). Proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography followed by Strep-Tactin purification
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Correct incorporation of pBPA was confirmed by Q-ToF LC-MS
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
The pET28a plasmid encoding mNG-NL fusion protein was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were
cultured in LB medium (10 g peptone, 10 g NaCL, 5 g yeast extract per liter) containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin.
Protein expression was induced using 0.1 mM IPTG at 20 oC overnight. The harvested cells were lysed using the
Bugbuster reagent and Benzonase. Proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography and Strep-Tactin
purification.
The SARS-COV-2 spike trimer protein was expressed in HEK-293T cells with a C-terminal trimerization motif and
Strep-tag using the pCAGGS expression plasmid, and purified from the culture supernatant by Strep-Tactin
chromatography as described previously44.
The pET28a plasmid encoding SUMO-TNFα-SB fusion protein was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were
cultured as described above. The harvested cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl Buffer (40 mM, pH 8.0, containing
125 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole) and Benzonase. Cell disruption was then performed by ultrasonication on
ice with 5 pulses of 20 s and an amplitude of 50%. After centrifugation, proteins were purified from the
supernatant at 4 oC, using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The His-SUMO-tag was cleaved from TNFα-SB by adding
1:1000 (v/v) SUMO protease into the protein solution which was further dialyzed in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH
8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT) overnight, at 4 oC. Cleaved TNFα-SB was obtained using Ni2+ affinity
chromatography to remove the cleaved His-SUMO-tag.

For lentiviral production of the two vectors, encoding either the RBD-LB or RBD-SB transgene, HEK293T cells
(ATCC® CRL-3216™) were transiently co-transfected with the abovementioned transfer vectors, as well as the
VSV-G envelope (pMD2.G) and packaging plasmids (pCMVR8.74), as previously described58. Plasmids pMD2.G
and pCMVR8.74 were gifts from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid #12259 and Addgene plasmid #22036,
respectively). HEK293T cells were then infected in order to establish polyclonal stable cell lines via the
integration of the lentiviral genetic elements into the cell genome. Cells were routinely cultured under standard
culturing conditions (37oC, 5% CO2, 95% air, and 95% relative humidity) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM 21885-025, ThermoFisher), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). For cell linemaintenance, cells were split at a ratio of 1:5-1:10, upon reaching confluency. Protein expression was induced
by the addition of 1 μg/mL doxycycline (D3447, Merck) in DMEM, supplemented with 2% FBS. Successful
transduction of cells was monitored by fluorescence imaging of the reporter protein mVenus, ensuing induction.
Protein-containing medium was harvested 4-5 days following induction and protein was purified by Strep-Tactin
affinity chromatography.
All the purified proteins were snap-frozen and stored at -80 oC until use.

Photoconjugation
Cardiac Troponin I antibodies 19C7 (4T21) and 4C2 (4T21), and C-reactive protein antibodies C6 (4C28cc) and
C135 (4C28) were obtained from Hytest. Therapeutic antibodies cetuximab and infliximab were obtained via the
Catherina hospital pharmacy in Eindhoven and Maxima Medisch Centrum pharmacy in Veldhoven, the
Netherlands, respectively. Adalimumab (A1048-100) was obtained from Gentaur. Anti-adalimumab/TNFα
monoclonal antibody (HCA207) and anti-infliximab (HCA213) were obtained from BioRad. Anti-SARS-COV-2
antibodies 47D11 and 49F1 were produced in HEK-293T cells and purified using Protein-A affinity
chromatography as described previously44. Commercially available anti-SARS-COV-2 D001, D002, D003 and D004
were ordered from Sino Biological. Photoconjugation reactions were performed using a Promed UVL-30 UV light
source (4×9 watt). Samples containing antibody and Gx-LB or Gx-SB in PBS buffer (pH7.4) were illuminated with
365 nm light for 30 to 180 minutes. The samples were kept on ice during photoconjugation. If necessary, the
photoconjugated products were further purified using Ni-NTA spin columns (ThermoFisher) followed by PD G10
desalting columns (GE Health) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibody-conjugates were stored
at 4 oC or -80oC until use.

Luminescent assays
Cardiac Troponin I (8T53) and C-reactive protein (8C72) were purchased from Hytest. Anti-cetuximab (HCA221),
anti-infliximab (HCA213G) and anti-adalimumab (HCA205) were ordered from BioRad. Similarly, SARS-COV-2
spike monomer was expressed with a C-terminal Strep-tag and purified by Strep-Tactin chromatography44.
Intensiometric assays were performed at sensor protein concentrations of 0.1-10 nM in a total volume of 20 µL
PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) BSA) in PerkinElmer flat white 384-well Optiplate. Measurements in diluted blood
plasma were performed by preparing the analytes in pooled human blood plasma and sensor proteins in PBS
buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) BSA). After incubation of sensor proteins and analytes for 5-60 minutes, NanoGlo
substrate (Promega, N1110) was added at a final dilution of 250 to 1000-fold. Luminescence intensity was
recorded on a Tecan Spark 10M plate reader with an integration time of 100 ms. For ratiometric assays, an
appropriate amount (0.5-50 pM) of calibrator mNG-NL was added into the samples and luminescence spectra
were recorded between 398 nm and 653 nm with a step size of 15 nm, a bandwidth of 25 nm and an integration
time of 1000 ms. The blue/green ratio was calculated by dividing bioluminescent emission at 458 nm by emission
at 518 nm. LOD and 95% confidence interval of the LOD were calculated by linear regression of the response
related to the analyte concentration for a limited range of concentrations (for an overview, see Supplementary
Table 1).
The luminescence signal was also recorded by using a SONY DSC-RX100 digital camera. The plate was placed into
a Styrofoam box to exclude the surrounding light. The pictures were taken through a hole in the box using the
digital camera with exposure times of 10-30 s, F value of 1.8 and ISO value of 1600-3200.
