Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused serious epidemic events in China and other countries.
With the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is urgent to explore the pathogenesis of this novel
coronavirus. However, the foundational research of COVID-19 is very weak. Although
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2,
information about SARS-CoV-2 invading airway epithelial cells is very limited. Based on the
analysis of the Human Protein Atlas database, we compared the virus-related receptors of
epithelial-derived cells from different organs and found potential key molecules in the local
microenvironment for SARS-CoV-2 entering airway epithelial cells. In addition, we found
that these proteins were associated with virus reactive proteins in host airway epithelial cells,
which may promote the activation of the immune system and the release of inflammatory
factors. Our findings provide a new research direction for understanding the potential
microenvironment required by SARS-CoV-2 infection in airway epithelial, which may assist
in the discovery of potential drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia was declared a “public health emergency of
international concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO). On January 7, 2020,
Chinese scientists isolated a new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 from an infected
patient. SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory diseases and is transmitted by
human-to-human contact [1]. However, the pathogenesis of this novel pathogen and any
potential drug targets remain to be elucidated. The clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2
resembles those of SARS-CoV [2], and the genome of SARS-CoV-2 represents good
homology with SARS-CoV [3], with 79.5% sequence consistency the two coronaviruses [4].
SARS-CoV mainly replicates in the lower respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar
damage [5]. The tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 also is the lower respiratory tract [6, 7]. In
addition, it was reported that cytopathic effects were observed 96 h after inoculation of
SARS-CoV-2 on the surface layers of human airway epithelial cells (EpCs), and a lack of
cilium beating was observed after virus infection [8]. However, it was found that Huh7
epithelial-like cells from the liver that are similar to airway EpCs produced no specific
cytopathic effects after six days of virus infection [8]. In addition, a recent study has shown
that an epithelial cell line from cervical cancer (HeLa) was also insensitive to SARS-CoV-2
infection [4]. These studies suggest that cells from different epithelial sources have different
susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are enveloped and require a series of interactions with their host cells during
virus entry, depending on tissue and cell-type specificities (e.g., receptor and
microenvironment) in addition to strain and species [9]. Although some microorganisms may
display a commensal relationship with EpCs [10], different microorganisms will specifically
attack the EpCs of different organs. For example, SARS-CoV mainly binds to cells
expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is one of the major receptors of

SARS-CoV when entering cells [11]. To date, more studies have confirmed that ACE2 is also
the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4]; however, ACE2 displays high expression in the
kidney, bile duct, and testis with low expression in the airways and lungs [12-14]. Lindskog,
et al also emphasized that the expression of ACE2 in human respiratory system is limited,
and questioned the role of ACE2 for infection in human lungs [15]. Therefore, we wonder
whether there are some key local microenvironment proteins specifically expressed on the
surface of airway EpC that makes the virus prefer airway EpCs. In some cases, additional cell
surface molecules or co-receptors are required for sufficient viral entry into host cells. It
remains unclear whether these local environments with specific components are related to the
susceptibility of different cell types to SARS-CoV-2.
To study the specificity of airway EpCs for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we compared host cell
receptors and virus infection-related host proteins expressed in epithelial or epithelial-derived
cells from different organs and found a series of specific proteins and key receptors of airway
EpCs related to virus infection. These proteins may be beneficial to the design of potential
drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Materials and methods
Data sources
Generally, the expression profiles of human genes on the protein level were derived from the
Human Protein Atlas (HPA, https://www.proteinatlas.org/) [16]. The virus-related biological
and functional gene ontology (GO) annotation terms were derived from the Gene Ontology
knowledgebase (http://geneontology.org/, released on 2020-01-01, containing 44,700 GO
terms) [17]. All human protein annotations were downloaded from the Swiss-Prot database of
UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/) [18].
Data analysis
The overall analysis pipeline is shown in Figure 1A. First, all GO terms that related to the



virus-host functions were collected from the GO-obo file. Then, after manually checking,
only those terms related to host-virus receptor and key biological processes were taken (Table
S2), and the human proteins involved in these particular GO terms were retrieved from
UniProt database. After that, the protein expression levels in epithelial and epithelial derived
cells from different organs were derived from the HPA and mapped to these proteins.
Data visualization
Heap map views of protein expression levels were displayed using conditional formatting of
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. All protein-protein interactions were retrieved from the
STRING database [19], and the protein-protein interaction network was built using
Cytoscape software (version 3.7.1) [20].
Results and discussion
Expression of virus-associated proteins on epithelial cells is organ-specific
First, ACE2 was found highly expressed in intestine, kidney, gallbladder, adrenal gland, testis,
and seminal vesicle among 61 organs in the HPA, at both the protein and RNA levels (Figure
S1), consistenting with previous reports [13, 14]. Single-cell sequencing also showed that
ACE2 was expressed in only amounts in airway tissue and type II alveolar cells (AT2). In
addition, mRNA data of all 64 cell lines in the HPA show low expression of ACE2 in human
small-cell lung cancer cells (SCLC-21H, Figure S2). However, ACE2 was not detected at the
protein level in airway or lung tissues, indicating that the correlation between protein and
transcription levels were widely varied [21]. Thus, limitations arise when predicting protein
expression based only on mRNA expression levels.
In a clinical study of 41 patients, it was speculated that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected the
lower respiratory tract [7]. A Chinese research group also isolated this virus from airway
EpCs [4, 8]. These results indicate that airway EpCs are possibly a susceptible and primary
target for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, initial viral entrance may cause cytopathological



changes to airway EpCs, resulting in coughing in 76% of patients [7] and further indicating
that the lung is also susceptible to virus infection. Thus, the susceptibility of different organs
to SARS-CoV-2 is not consistent with corresponding protein expression levels of ACE2 on
these organs. We therefore asked (i) why SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract rather than
other organs as its first target organ, (ii) what is the difference between airway EpCs and
epithelial-derived cells of other organs, and (iii) whether specific local microenvironment
components were required for SARS-CoV-2 infection besides ACE2 that are sufficient to
compensate for the low expression of ACE2 in airway EpCs.
To explore these issues, we first outlined the expression profile of virus receptors or
receptor-related membrane proteins (collectively named virus microenvironment components)
of EpCs located in different organs. We used the human protein atlas (HPA) database [16] to
extract the protein expression level of 65 receptors involved in “virus receptor activity”
(GO:0001618) of EpCs and epithelial or epithelial-derived cells from 14 organs (16 cell types)
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Materials and Methods). By comparing the data of different
organs, we found that the expression pattern of these virus microenvironment components
varies among the epithelial-derived cells from different organs. We focused on airway EpCs
including virus microenvironment components from the nasopharynx and bronchi because
these two sites are most likely to be preferred by SARS-CoV-2.
We found serpin family B member 3 (SERPINB3) and cadherin-related family member 3
(CDHR3) were specifically expressed in airway EpCs, which attracted our attention (Figure
1B) for their potential as the viral important microenvironment in the airway. In particular,
CDHR3 shows little or no expression within the epithelial-derived cells of other organs
(Figure 1C). SERPINB3 is in the serine protease family, and it was reported that the S protein
of coronavirus can be activated by transmembrane serine protease family member (TTSP) to
complete its membrane fusion process [22, 23]. Thus, the role of SERPINB3 on airway EpCs

during SARS-CoV-2 infection merits further study.
Other potential receptors such as xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1), in
addition to being highly expressed on airway EpCs, are also expressed on the surface of other
epithelial-derived cells. XPR1 was also highly expressed on colon gland cells and tonsil
squamous EpCs; moderately expressed on EpCs of the oral mucosa, lung, kidney and muscle;
and poorly expressed on liver and bile duct cells (Figure 1B, Figure S3). Clinical and
epidemiological studies also revealed that diarrhea has been observed in a subset of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2 in addition to the pulmonary manifestations [6-8], indicating that
SARS-CoV-2 can also infect the intestinal tract as well as the lung tissue through specific
receptors and microenvironment components. This putative intestinal infection require
special attention, because it suggests that SARS-CoV-2 also may be transmitted through the
fecal-oral route. Stool samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States
also have been positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, strongly suggesting fecal
transmission [24]. Nucleic acid of the similar coronavirus SARS-CoV was also detected in
patients’ stool samples [25-27].
Among the proteins with low expression on airway EpCs, we focused on dystroglycan 1
(DAG1) and found it is only specifically expressed in airway and lung pneumocytes EpCs
(Figure 1B). Together these data suggest that the expression levels of putative virus

organ-specific.
EpCs from different organs are specific to virus response
We next investigated whether the proteins that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection display
organ-specific expression. We used the same scheme to extract virus-host interaction-related
entries (Table S2). In the search category of viral-reactive proteins that modulate host cell
morphology or physiology, few were expressed in the liver. Notably, Bcl2-associated agonist

of cell death (BAD) and zinc finger C3H-type containing 12A (ZC3H12A) were highly
expressed exclusively in airway EpCs; neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3) was
moderately expressed exclusively in airway EpCs. Another protein, eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 (EIF1AK4), which was highly expressed in airway EpCs,
also was found moderately expressed in the lung, kidney, and muscle (Figure S4).
In terms of viral defense, we found that most of the proteins reactive to viruses are highly
expressed in different organs (Figure S4). We found more specific highly expressed proteins
in airway EpCs such as calcitonin gene-related peptide-receptor component protein (CRCP),
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 interacting protein 1 (TRAF3IP1),
adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit beta 1 (AP1B1), Bcl2, ATP/GTP Binding Protein
Like (AGBL)4, AGBL5, adenosine deaminase RNA specific (ADAR), SIN3A,
high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1), and ZC3H12A. In addition,
several highly expressed proteins were found not only expressed in airway EpCs, but also in
the epithelial-derived cells of other organs. For example, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing
enzyme catalytic subunit 3A (APOBEC3A) was highly expressed in the colon (glandular
cells); transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), AP2A2, and ring finger protein 26 (RNF26)
were highly expressed in the esophagus (squamous EpCs); RNF26 in the oral mucosa
(squamous EpCs); and ribonuclease L (RNASEL) in the tonsil (squamous EpCs). These
results indicate that although the responses of different organs to the virus were identical,
specific response proteins to the virus vary between different types of EpCs. In particular,
highly expressed response proteins on airway EpCs may play a positive role in regulating the
propagation and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interaction network between virus microenvironment components and virus response
proteins in airway EpCs
To study whether the virus induces a biological response after infection through

airway-specific receptors, we established a network of interactions between the receptors in
the airway EpCs and host reactive proteins against the virus. The network controlled several
biological processes including virus receptor activity, defense response to virus, viral
modulation of host morphology or physiology, detection of virus, evasion or tolerance of host
defenses by the virus, viral suppression of host apoptotic process, and viral regulation of viral
protein levels in the host cell (Figure 2A). Each protein in the interaction network may,
together with the receptor of airway EpCs, be involved in the biological process of host cells
after virus infection. For example, Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) box polypeptide 58 (DDX58,
also known as retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein, RIG-I), which had the largest number of
interacting proteins, acted as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids and played a major
role in sensing viral infection and in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses
including the induction of type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interferon
induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), an important paralog gene of DDX58, was
involved in the alteration of RNA secondary structure such as translation initiation, nuclear
and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. DDX58 and IFIH1
were both putative RNA helicases.
In the interaction network, we focused on the protein interaction of virus microenvironment
components with high expression in airway EpCs, which probably perform a specific
function in airway EpCs after virus infection. RNASEL, the interacting protein of XPR1,
matched these parameters and was specifically highly expressed in airway and tonsil
squamous EpCs (Figure 2A). RNASEL probably mediates its antiviral effects through a
combination of direct cleavage of single-stranded viral RNAs, inhibition of protein synthesis
through the degradation of rRNA, induction of apoptosis, and induction of other antiviral
genes. Another receptor protein, DAG1, which was seldom expressed in airway EpCs,
interacted with interleukin (IL)-33 (Figure 2A). IL-33 binds to and signals through the IL-1

receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1)/ST2 receptor, which in turn activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in target cells.
In addition, we found most of the interacting proteins of virus microenvironment components
on airway EpCs

are related to the immune response, including toll-like receptors (TLR),

NF-κB, RIG-I-like receptor, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein
(NOD)-like receptor and TNF signaling pathways (Figure 2B).
Upon detection of a pathogen, epithelia respond by upregulating expression of defensins,
which confer immediate protection to the host, and alarmins, which convey danger signals to
neighboring EpCs. Epithelia are equipped with TLR surface receptors, which recognize
conserved molecular patterns associated with pathogens or tissue damage. TLR signals
activate NF-κB through the adaptor protein MyD88 [28]. We found that the most enriched
signaling pathways in the interaction network between airway EpC receptors and
host-reactive protein are the TLR signaling pathway followed by the NF-κB signaling
pathway (Figure 2B). In addition, we found putative activation of the RIG-I-like receptor
signaling pathway, which begins a downstream signal pathway to secrete type I interferon in
the interaction network. Many proteins related to the production and regulation of type I
interferon were also observed in the interaction network (Figure S5). The most enriched item
was IL-1β, which is consistent with the fact that the serum of patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 has a higher pro-inflammatory factor IL-1β than that of uninfected people [7].
In addition, the NOD-like receptor and TNF signaling pathways mediate the expression of a
variety of inflammatory factors including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1),
interferon-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and TNF-α which are consistent with the COVID-19
clinical characteristics [6, 7].
These results indicate that the virus microenvironment components expressed in airway EpCs,
especially those interacting proteins with specific and highly expressed microenvironment

components, may be involved in inhibition of host cell biological processes and important
immune response pathways related to the antiviral response.
Conclusion
In this manuscript, we proposes the possibility that airway-specific virus microenvironment
components may assist the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, although the
expression of ACE2 is very low in the tracheal epithelium that provides other potential
directions to study SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway EpCs. Our study also suggests that the
clinical symptoms of different organs may be related to the specific expression of virus
microenvironment components in these various organs. For example, SARS-CoV-2 might be
involved in

microenvironment components and virus-reactive proteins in airway EpCs, which may be
related to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. These results
provide a preliminary research direction for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2
infection in airway EpCs. In addition, our study identified that some virus microenvironment
components are not only highly expressed in airway epithelium but are also specifically
expressed in other organs, suggesting that more organs may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
such as the intestine and kidney.
