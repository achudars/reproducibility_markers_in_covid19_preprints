Abstract

25

SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has costed enormous human lives in the recent

26

past. The present study is an investigation of the viral codon adaptation, ORFs’ stability and

27

tRNA co-adaptation with humans. We observed that for the codon usage bias in viral ssRNA,

28

ORFs have near values of folding free energies and codon adaptation index with mRNAs of the

29

human housekeeping CDS. However, the correlation between the stability of the ORFs in ssRNA

30

and CAI is stronger than the mRNA stability and CAI of HKG, suggesting a greater expression

31

capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis reflects polymorphism in the virus for ORF1ab,

32

surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ORFs. Non-synonymous mutations have

33

shown non-polar substitutions. Out of the twelve mutations nine are for a higher t-RNA copy

34

number. Viruses in general have high mutation rates. To understand the chances of survival for

35

the mutated SARS-CoV-2 we did simulation for synonymous mutations. It resulted in 50%

36

ORFs with higher stability than their native equivalents. Thus, considering only the synonymous

37

mutations the virus can exhibit a lot of polymorphism. Collectively our data provides new

38

insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the human t-RNA compatibility.

Significance

52

Survivability of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is essential for its spread. It has overlapping genes

53

exhibiting a high codon optimization with humans even after a higher codon usage bias. They

54

seem to possess cognizance for high copy number t-RNA (cognate or near-cognate) in humans,

55

while mutating. Even though, it has been well established that native transcripts posses the

56

highest stability, our in-silico studies show that SARS-CoV-2 under mutations give rise to ORFs

57

with higher stability. These results significantly present the virus’s ability and the credibility of

58

survival for the mutants. Despite its focus on a geographical location it explains the ongoing

59

behavior of SARS-CoV-2 for a steady existence in humans as all the different lineages have a

60

common origin. Wuhan, China.

1. Introduction

63

According to the world health organization the first human case of covid-19 was reported on 31st

64

December, 2019 in the Wuhan province of China. Since then, within a span of seven months the

65

virus has spread across the globe infecting ~ >14 million and killing over ~608,000 people.

66

Ministry of health and family welfare (Govt. of India) reported ~>402,529 active cases and

67

~>28,084 deaths as on 21st of july, 2020. COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory illness and

68

in some cases acute respiratory distress syndrome (1). Additionally, COVID-19 is seen to cause

69

systemic inflammation leading to sepsis, heart failure and multi-organ dysfunction(2) .Covid-19

70

is a viral disease caused due to the virus SARS-CoV-2 which has a close similarity with SARS-

71

CoV and MERS-CoV(3, 4).

72

The genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 shows a single-stranded positive sense RNA (5). It

73

has twelve functional open reading frames containing ~30,000 nucleotides which encodes for

74

~7096 residues long polyprotein (6). They represent all the structural and the non-structural

75

proteins that help the virus to infect and survive in the host’s cell (7). The open reading frames

76

are ORF1ab consisting of overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b, followed by other proteins i.e. Spike

77

(S), ORF3a, Envelope (E), Membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid (N),

78

and ORF10(8). After a virus has infected the host, it overtakes the host’s translational machinery

79

by attaching the RNA to the ribosomes which turns the host’s cells into a ribovirocell. In a

80

ribovirocell the viral and the cellular genome co-exist and the cell still divides producing virions

81

(9, 10) .

82

Since, viruses depend on their host for its gene translation; our study provides a comparative

83

analysis on the codon usage overlap of the viral genome with the human housekeeping genes.

84

We have also tried to study its compatibility with the human cognate and near-cognate t-RNA

85

pool. While housekeeping genes have a uniform and high expression in all the cells of an

86

organism they provide a better insight for a comparative analysis on the codon usage.

87

A codon is the combination of three out of four nucleotides Adenine, Thymine (Uracil in RNA),

88

Cytosine and Guanine. There are a total of 61 codons that encodes 20 amino-acids. Leaving

89

aside the amino-acids tryptophan and methionine all the other 18 amino-acids are encoded by

90

two to six degenerate codons. The degenerate codons are usually referred as the synonymous

91

codons due to their property of encoding the same amino-acid. Along-with encoding the amino-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217083; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

92

acids, codons are helpful in carrying extra information (11). Like the specific arrangements of

93

nucleotides have been seen to act as recognition sites for protein interaction with DNA/RNA,

94

modulate mRNA stability controlling their secondary structures which in-turn guides the

95

ribosomal abundance during translation (12, 13). Hence, genes/genomes in different organisms

96

tend to show the usage of a subset of codons from the pool of 61 codons depending upon their

97

intrinsic requirements. Such a phenomenon is known as codon usage bias. Generally, higher

98

codon usage bias is seen in highly expressed genes (14, 15). Also, these set of genes are strongly

99

optimized to a small set of t-RNAs (16). According to the translational selection hypothesis the

100

aforementioned conditions are suitable for rapid translation with higher efficiency and fidelity

101

(17, 18). We found that the previous and all the mutated SARS-CoV-2 has comparatively higher

102

codon usage bias than the human housekeeping genes and is proficiently compatible with the

103

human t-RNA pool of anti-codons.

104

In general, viruses have mutation rates which is almost a million times higher than their hosts

105

(19). So to understand the mutational capacity aiding in survival for SARS-CoV-2 we performed

106

multiple simulations of synonymous mutations on each ORF. The result reveals that under the

107

inherent codon usage bias the virus can attain ORF stability maxima greater than their native

108

sequences which will be helpful in greater translational efficiency(13). Hence, SARS-CoV-2 still

109

poses a threat due to its immense mutational impetus that has the ability to keep the bias and

110

anti-codon compatibility intact, and produce stable ORFs that can result in translational

111

efficiency to be greater than its host.

2. Materials and methods

122

2.1. Data collection

123

We downloaded all the CDS for SARS-CoV-2 and Homo sapiens housekeeping genes from the

124

NCBI database (Refer Table S2.1, Supplementary tables). Longest transcripts were selected.

125

MT539164 is a SARS-CoV-2 strain is referred as the predecessor strain in our study; sequences

126

collected on a later date are referred as successor strains. Copy number for the Homo sapiens

127

tRNA molecules containing anticodons for each 61 codons were obtained from GtRNAdb 2.0

128

release 18.1(20). The near-cognate t-RNA mappings were done for the unavailable t-RNA

129

containing anti-codons with respect to codons in SARS-CoV-2 (Refer Table S2.2,

130

Supplementary tables) using the dataset available from (21).

131
132

2.2. Randomization of the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs

133

Mutations were simulated through synonymous codons’ randomization within the gene without

134

affecting the intrinsic codon usage frequency and amino-acids. (Refer S1.1, supplementary

135

materials and methods).

136
137

2.3. Codon adaptation index and co-adaptation index calculations (co-AI)

138

Emboss cusp, cai and chips programs were used to find the codon usage frequency, codon

139

adaptation index and effective number of codons (22). co-AI was calculated as done by Victor et

140

al. (23, 24).

141
142

2.4. Folding energy calculation

143

The folding free energies of ORFs were calculated for windows of size 50 nucleotides and a step

144

size of 30 nucleotides using seqfold (25). Energies predicted are averaged over the number of

145

segments to obtain the folding free energy for an entire ORF (Refer S1.2, supplementary

146

materials and methods).

2.4 þn, þs and Statistical calculations

149

We have used Pearson correlations with 95% level of confidence as a measure of significance

3. Results

173
174

3.1 ENC, co-AI and CAI of SARS-CoV-2 with human (HKG)

175

Effective number of codons (ENC) quantifies the codon usage bias in genes/genomes. It ranges

176

from 20(extremely biased) to 61(nil bias).Thus, a higher value of ENC indicates lower bias and

177

vice-versa. In our dataset for SARS-CoV-2 predecessor strain the ENC=45.001 and for

178

Housekeeping genes the ENC=56.550. Other successor strains have also shown very near values

179

of ENC amongst themselves and with the predecessor (Table1). co-adaptation index (co-AI) or

180

tRNA co-adaptation is an indicator of the codon optimization to the tRNA pool (23, 24). As

181

viruses depend on the translational machinery of the host, their inherent codon composition

182

needs to be compatible with the host’s tRNA pool. The co-AI for SARS-Cov-2 (Pearson

183

ρ=0.304; P<0.05; n=61; MT539164) and HKG (Pearson ρ=0.350; P<0.05; n=61) shows a

184

significant positive correlation. Successor strains have shown very near values of co-AI amongst

185

themselves and with the predecessor strain (Table1). Codon adaptation index (CAI) measures the

186

relative adaptiveness of the codon usage of a gene towards the codon usage of highly expressed

187

genes, and it is used to estimate the gene expression level (24). Using the codon set of highly

188

expressed genes in Homo sapiens, SARS-CoV-2 predecessor strain yielded CAI

189

which is very close to HKG CAI mean = 0.73 (Refer Table S2.3, Supplementary tables). Successor

190

strains have shown identical CAI values amongst themselves and with the predecessor strains.

mean

= 0.637

191
192

3.2 ORF stability and gene expression level in SARS-CoV-2

193

Here, we have considered the structural stability of the ORFs, owing to its secondary structure.

194

ORF stability referred as the minimum folding energy (mFE) is measured by Gibbs free energy;

195

with greater negative values indicating higher feasibility in folding, thus, higher ORF stability

196

(Refer Table S2.3, Supplementary tables). There is a significant negative correlation between

197

CAI and mFE for the predecessor strain (Pearson ρ = -0.63; P <0.05; n=12). A similar trend is

198

seen for the house keeping genes (Pearson ρ = -0.563; P <0.1; n=12) (Refer S1.3, Supplementary

199

materials and methods on the selection of statistical methods for small samples). It indicates that

200

stable ORFs have higher expression values and SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a stronger correlate

201

demonstrating the virus’s innate ability to have a greater expression capacity than humans.

202
203

3.3 Simulating mutations: synonymous random shuffling within SARS-CoV-2 ORFs

204

Hundred in-silico mutated sequences were generated through random synonymous codon

205

shuffling of each ORF in the predecessor strain. For each random sequence of a gene we

206

maintained the inherent codon usage frequency and the amino-acid sequences equivalent to each

207

gene in the predecessor strain. Minimum folding energy for all the sequences were calculated

208

(Refer S1.1, Supplementary materials and methods). We found that 50% of the ORFs showed

209

stability maxima, higher than their native ORFs (Refer Table S2.4, Supplementary tables). The

210

difference between the stabilities obtained is significant which was found through the one-tailed

211

t-test (t= -1.618; P<0.1; n=12)

212
213

3.4 Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 mutations

214

Analyzing the six different strains (successor strains) of the SARS-Cov-2 (dated: 2020-05-30 &

215

2020-06-29) we have observed changes in ORF1a polyprotein, ORF1b polyprotein, surface

216

glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. They have incorporated synonymous as well as

217

non-synonymous mutations (Refer Table S2.5, Supplementary tables). Overall twelve codon

218

changes (different frequencies) have been recorded, resulting in a miniscule GC-content

219

reduction (~0.01%) in entirety (Table 2). All the non-synonymous changes are non-polar (Table

220

3). Out of the twelve mutations recorded, seven showed the choice for rare codons, which after

221

near-cognate t-RNA mapping has shown the choice for higher t-RNA gene copy number, three

222

showed the choice for frequently used codons and the rest two are neutral changes. In totality

223

nine mutations are for the higher gene copy number of cognate and near-cognate t-RNA

224

containing the anticodons (Table 2). The polymorphism was calculated between the predecessor

225

strain and all the successor strains as the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous

226

polymorphisms (þn/ þs). þn/ þs for all the mutations has generated values >1 (Table 4).

229

4. Discussions

230

4.1 Analyzing the mutations in SARS-CoV-2

231

RNA viruses have an extremely high mutation rates. It can be around a million times higher than

232

their host. These mutations account for their heightened virulence and evolvability. Higher

233

mutation rates are a consequence of selection of variants exhibiting faster genomic replication

234

(19). In a month’s time, SARS-CoV-2 has shown mutations in the ORF1ab polyprotein, surface

235

glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The former two proteins have been shown to

236

play an important role in the pathogenecity of the virus and the latter is responsible for the

237

ssRNA packaging (6, 26). All of the mutations which are non-synonymous incorporated non-

238

polar amino-acids in their protein (Table 3). Earlier analysis on the amino-acid composition of

239

proteins have shown that non-polar amino-acids facilitate in the initiation and the propagation of

240

protein folding (27), suggesting that the mutations here, might be required for improved protein

241

folding that may provide enhanced proliferation for the virus particles. The mutations occurring

242

in successor strains of a species (generally for viruses) are quantified as the ratio of the

243

polymorphisms occurring in them. þn and þs calculates the relative abundance of non-

244

synonymous and synonymous polymorphism. Diversifying or positive selection happens when

245

þn/þs>1, whereas þn/þs<1 suggests purifying selection (28, 29). Looking at the values of þn/þs

246

(Table 4, Figure 1) obtained in our dataset it is indicative of a purifying selection for the

247

mutations. Even though genes have shown a purifying selection in a month’s time, the

248

possibilities of further mutations cannot be discarded due to the inherently higher mutation rates

249

of the viruses in general(19) and the value is not suggestive of the fixation of the present

250

strains(30).

251
252

4.2 Homo sapiens’ housekeeping genes and its importance in SARS-CoV-2 gene evaluation

253

Housekeeping genes are established to be evolutionarily conserved set of genes that tends to

254

have higher codon adaptation index. They are required for the basic cell maintenance processes.

255

Hence, they exhibit

256

conditions (31). For a comparative analysis in our further studies on simulating mutations, t-

257

RNA compatibility and gene expression with SARS-CoV-2 we curated a set of human

258

housekeeping genes (Refer Table S2.1, Supplementary tables). As SARS-CoV-2 affects the

uniform expression levels throughout different cells under different

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217083; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

259

respiratory system we needed a set of housekeeping genes that can be relied upon even if there

260

was any kind of pulmonary infection. The set of housekeeping genes (HKG) were taken as a

261

control as suggested through the acute pulmonary inflammation study by(32).

262
263

4.3 Anti-codon mapping in SARS-CoV-2

264

Albeit humans have nearly five hundred different t-RNA genes but only forty eight anticodons

265

are represented by them (33). However, humans use all the sixty one codons in their genome.

266

This clearly shows two important aspects in the translational machinery: (i) for some codons,

267

translation is achieved through near-cognate t-RNAs; (ii) there are multiple copies of the same t-

268

RNA. Due to the dependence of the virus on its host for translation, the absentee cognate t-RNAs

269

will be replaced by a near-cognate t-RNA (21). Hence, for a proper calculation of the co-

270

adaptation index the codons lacking cognate t-RNA were needed to be mapped with the most

271

appropriate near-cognate t-RNA in humans (Refer Table S2.2, Supplementary tables). The

272

mapping is suggestive of the availability of the cognate and near-cognate t-RNAs for all the

273

codons during translation(21). Moreover, it creates a clearer picture about the choices of near-

274

cognate t-RNAs by SARS-CoV-2, and in our dataset we found that the choices are towards either

275

highest or moderately higher copy number of near-cognate t-RNA containing anti-codons.

276
277

4.4 Codon usage bias, t-RNA adaptation, and gene expression of SARS-CoV-2

278

Effective number of codons is the quantification of the codon usage bias for a gene or a genome

279

indicating the subset of codon usage from the pool of available 61 codons(34). But, it doesn’t tell

280

about either the nucleotide composition or codon usage overlap in a comparative genome

281

analysis. The ENC for HKG is higher to SARS-CoV-2 (Refer Results). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 has

282

a more biased gene compared to the housekeeping genes. Generally, a biased gene tends to show

283

a higher gene expression level compared a lowly biased system (18, 35, 36). In order to check

284

the same, and codon usage overlap we calculated the CAI (a proxy for gene expression) for

285

SARS-CoV-2 (Refer Results). As the virus relies on the host’s molecular machinery we assumed

286

the human codon reference set of highly expressed genes for the calculation of CAI (Refer

287

Results). Thus, CAI is helpful in understanding the overlap of codon usage patterns. The SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217083; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

288

CoV-2 CAI value showed an 85.36% overlap in the expression magnitude with the housekeeping

289

genes (Figure 2). In fact a biased system cannot always show a high gene expression level unless

290

codon optimization is present(37). For a biased gene this values is an indicator of a sufficient

291

codon optimization with the host. Even though CAI values are indicative of the gene expression

292

levels it’s intuitive to think on the role of t-RNA abundance in influencing the gene expression

293

(i.e. protein abundance). We calculated the co-AI, a correlate between the codons and t-RNA

294

gene copy number (Refer Results). co-AI for HKG is 0.350 and predecessor strain is 0.304

295

(Refer Results, Table 1). The co-AI values were also calculated for the successors. It was found

296

that all the successors have approximately the same values and is very near to the predecessor

297

strain (Table 1). This strongly confirms a very close proximity of the codons in SARS-CoV-2

298

with the human t-RNA pool. The results signify that the codon composition of the SARS-CoV-2

299

is highly optimized with the anticodons in Homo sapiens. Here, it can be propounded that even

300

under the mutations SARS-CoV-2 shows high codon optimization, hence, during its infection in

301

the host the expression might be higher than other host genes.

302
303

4.5 Investigating the ORF stability of SARS-CoV-2 through mutational simulations

304

It’s the mRNA stability which is a determiner of the ribosomal abundance during translation.

305

Greater stability of the mRNA results in a higher ribosomal abundance leading to higher

306

translational efficiency(13). There is a positive correlation between the ORFs’ stability and CAI

307

in HKG (Refer Results; Table S2.3, Supplementary tables). A similar behavior is seen in SARS-

308

CoV-2 which implies that with increasing stability of the ORFs the gene expression level

309

increases. It was seen that SARS-CoV-2 holds a stronger and significant correlation between

310

ORFs’ stability and CAI, compared to the human HKG, which indicates the virus’s capacity of

311

expression to be greater than that of humans.

312

Viruses have a very high rate of mutation and in order to examine the scope of plausible codon

313

changes, synonymous codon randomization study was carried on the predecessor strain. This was

314

an in-silico study; simulating synonymous mutations (Refer S1.1, Supplementary materials and

315

methods; Results; Table S2.4, Supplementary tables). As the codon composition in each

316

318

been swapped in the randomized sequences and they will show changes in their folding free

319

energies that will influence the secondary structures and hence the ribosomal abundance.

320

Previous study has established that native mRNAs have the highest stability compared to their

321

in-silico randomized variants (37). On the contrary we found that 50% of the synonymously

322

randomized ORFs exhibited folding free energy maxima greater than their native ORFs (Figure

323

3). We tested for the significance of the difference between the initial (native) and stability

324

maxima for the randomized sequences through t-test and found it to be significant (Refer

325

Results). Thus, the in-silico randomizations of the sequences provide an insight into the

326

mutational possibilities of the virus under the inherent codon frequency. Hence, the virus can

327

develop synonymous polymorphisms without affecting the protein sequences and yet attain ORF

328

stability greater than its predecessor strains. This result in general points the remarkable

329

mutational capability of SARS-CoV-2.

4.6 Polymorphism and the t-RNA dependence of SARS-CoV-2

332

As already stated, even under the absence of anti-codons, translation doesn’t stall, instead near-

333

cognate t-RNAs containing anti-codons are employed. In the predecessor strain the t-RNA

334

dependence for the absentee anticodons is seen to be inclined towards a higher gene copy

335

number of near-cognate t-RNAs containing the anticodons. If the viral genome always tends to

336

select anticodons with higher copy number of cognate or near-cognate t-RNAs then, in all the

337

mutations it would show the same. Initially, on screening the successor strains, we found that out

338

of the twelve mutations four were for codons which had no gene for cognate-tRNA. But, after

339

the near cognate t-RNA mapping they all exhibited a choice for the highest gene copy number of

340

near-cognate t-RNA containing the anti-codons. Three out of the twelve mutations were for a

341

higher number of cognate t-RNA, two showed no change and only three preferred, cognate

342

anticodons with a marginally lower t-RNA copy number (Table 2). The result clearly states that,

343

at the genomic level SARS-CoV-2 is thoroughly tuned to be highly compatible with the

344

translational machinery of its host i.e. Homo sapiens.

5. Conclusion

348

The findings presented here reveal a strong universal connection between the codon usage

349

patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 with Homo sapiens t-RNA pool. Even with a high mutation rate the

350

choice of the codons has a strong inclination for the high copy number of the cognate and near-

351

cognate tRNA containing anticodons. The study highlights that under the conditions of

352

synonymous mutations if the inherent codon composition remains intact, the transcripts have the

353

possibility of gaining greater stability. Generally, with increased stability higher gene expression

354

is seen (13). It is interesting to find that the virus even with a higher bias than the human HKG

355

has a considerable codon optimization with the latter. As bias is not the only essential criteria for

356

heightened gene expression the virus has notably balanced both, bias and optimization. We also

357

found that the virus has undergone purifying selection and are exhibiting polymorphism with

358

changes in its ORF1ab polyprotein, surface glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein.

359

These mutations have been in a very short period of time (~30 days) hence, shows a rapid rate of

360

mutation in the virus. These set of proteins are important for the virus and changes in them might

361

be important for the increased survivability of the virus (38). With the simulation study of

362

mutations, rate of mutation in the virus (in ~30 days) and looking at the current global

363

pandemism it’s indicative that SARS-CoV-2 might undergo greater number of mutations

364

producing very high number of variants in geographically different populations of humans.
