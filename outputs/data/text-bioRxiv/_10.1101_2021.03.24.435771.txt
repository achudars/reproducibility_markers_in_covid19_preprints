Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry
into cells after which the spike protein is cleaved by the transmembrane serine
30

protease 2 (TMPRRS2) to facilitate viral-host membrane fusion. ACE2 and
TMPRRS2 expression profiles have been analyzed at the genomic, transcriptomic,
and single-cell RNAseq level, however, biologically relevant protein receptor
organization in whole tissues is still poorly understood. To describe the organ-level
architecture of receptor expression, related to the ability of ACE2 and TMPRRS2

35

to mediate infectivity, we performed a volumetric analysis of whole Syrian
hamster lung lobes. Lung tissue of infected and control animals were stained using
antibodies against ACE2 and TMPRRS2, combined with fluorescent spike protein
and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein staining. This was followed by light-sheet
microscopy imaging to visualize expression patterns. The data demonstrates that

40

infection is restricted to sites with both ACE2 and TMPRRS2, the latter is
expressed in the primary and secondary bronchi whereas ACE2 is predominantly
observed in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Conversely, infection completely
overlaps at these sites where ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-localize.

Main
SARS-CoV-2 has sparked a pandemic and additional means to understand infection
dynamics of this virus will facilitate counter-measures. SARS coronaviruses carry a
55

single protruding envelope protein, called spike, that is essential for binding to and
subsequent infection of host cells. The trimeric spike protein binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which functions as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV 1,2.
After binding and internalization, TMPRSS2 induces the spike protein into its
fusogenic form allowing fusion of the viral and target membrane. Several other

60

attachment factors and/or receptors have been reported 3-6, but it is generally accepted
that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are essential.

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and have been analyzed
using several different genetic techniques
65

7-9

. Suprisingly a common denominator in

these studies is the high expression of these proteins in extrapulmonary tissues, whereas
the virus mainly infects the respiratory tract. A drawback of these genetic studies is that
they do not determine biochemical expression and provide limited spatial information.
High-resolution mapping of three-dimensional (3D) structures in intact tissues are
indispensable in many biological studies, yet hardly employed to study viral receptors

70

in their host organs concerning viral infection. The conventional method of histological
sectioning followed by the imaging of individual sections is commonly used and rather
valuable, but this process does not provide spatial information. Recent developments in
whole organ clearing, imaging, and analysis of these large data sets do now allow for
the characterization of whole organs 10-12.

Different animal models have been employed to recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 infection in
humans, these are instrumental and indispensable to develop vaccines and therapeutics
13

. Several reviews are available that succinctly compare the advantages and

disadvantages of different animal models
80

14,15

, and the Syrian hamster is now widely

accepted as an extremely suitable small animal model 16-18.

Here we aimed to elucidate receptor distribution in the lungs of Syrian hamsters and
correlate these patterns with the location of infection. To do so we stained whole lung
lobes of SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters and control animals, using a variety of
85

antibodies against ACE2, TMPRRS2, and the viral nucleoprotein to detect the accepted
functional receptor, restriction factor, and location of infection. The results clearly show
that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are unequally distributed in the lung and that only
overlapping regions are infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 binding and receptors on lung tissue slides of Syrian
hamsters lungs.
We initially started our studies into receptor binding of SARS-CoV trimeric receptor
binding domain (RBD) proteins and the detection of ACE2 in serial tissue slices of

95

Syrian hamster lungs

19

. We now extended these studies by detecting TMPRSS2 to

determine where ACE2 and TMPRRS overlap and if infection would occur in those
portions of the lung. SARS-CoV-2 RBDs bind to the apical side of the bronchioles and
alveoli of Syrian hamster tissue slides (Fig. 1 A1-3). In Syrian hamster lungs 4-days
post-infection (dpi, SARS-CoV-2 infected) SARS-CoV-2 RBD failed to bind as
100

previously shown (Fig. 1 A4-6), whereas significant ACE2 expression is observed in

the alveoli and bronchioles of mock and 4-dpi Syrian hamster lungs (Fig. 1 B1-6). Even
though we observe alveolar staining of ACE2 in infected Syrian hamster lungs
bronchiolar staining is predominant (Fig. 1 B4-6), whilst in non-infected Syrian
hamster, the signal is accumulated in both the bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 1 B1-3).
105

We next characterized TMPRSS2 expression; bronchiolar and alveolar staining was
observed in non-infected Syrian hamster lungs, for infected Syrian hamster lungs
staining is predominantly visualized in the bronchioles with minor alveolar staining
(Fig. 1 C1-6). For infected Syrian hamster lungs an overall reduced signal intensity is
observed, in line with previous reports that demonstrate a possible downregulation of

110

receptors and restriction factors

19,20

. Further staining was performed with an anti-

keratin antibody, as keratin 8 (K8) and keratin 18 (K18) are expressed in human
alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells 21,22. We used this antibody to assess bronchiolar
and alveolar staining of TMPRSS2, ACE2, and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (Fig. 1
D1-6). In non-infected tissue slides K8/K18 is present in the alveoli and bronchioles
115

(Fig. 1 D1-3), in infected Syrian hamsters a distinct reduction of K8/K18 is observed,
probably due to pulmonary damage (Fig. D4-6). Thus, we can detect SARS-CoV
receptor binding related to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 specifically in different parts of the
bronchiolar and alveolar system. However, the use of tissue slides does not provide
spatial information and prompted us to explore volumetric reconstructions instead.

Volumetric analysis was performed on Syrian hamster lung lobes to assess spatial
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in organ samples. The workflow of volumetric
imaging and data analysis is described in Figure 2A. To determine SARS-CoV-2

trimeric RBD proteins 19. The trimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound throughout the lung

bronchus, all the way to the alveolar sacs (Fig. 2 B1-4). In the 3D render and orthoslice
of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD stained samples (Fig. 2 B1 and B3), we observe a lack
135

of signal in the primary/secondary bronchus relative to the tertiary bronchus. ACE2
receptor expression was highly similar to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD staining (Fig. 2 C14), however with varying signal intensity in the secondary, tertiary bronchi, and
bronchioles (Fig. 2 C1 and C3). Additionally, comparatively lower antibody staining
intensity is observed in the alveoli compared to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD trimer, which

140

is bound to a wider variety of cells. This might be attributed to interactions with other
attachment factors, for example, heparin sulfates and sialic acids 4-6. Hamster lung lobes
incubated with anti-TMPRSS2 antibodies display intense staining in the secondary and
tertiary bronchi with minor staining visible in the alveoli and significant staining of the
outer regions of the lung (Fig. 2 D1-4). In Fig. 2 E1 and E3 high signal intensity in the

145

primary and secondary bronchus is observed with an anti-K8/K18 antibody, with
occasional staining in several tertiary bronchi (Fig. 2 E1-4). In the macroscopic 3D
render and orthoslice (Fig. 2 E1 and E3) we identify regions with alveolar staining, this
can also be observed with the higher resolution data in Fig. 2 E2 and E4. Due to the
extended antibody incubation periods using whole tissues, we used a mix of secondary

150

antibodies only, in which we observe very minor background on the sides of tissues,
indicating a lack of a-specific binding while tissue penetration occurs when using
primary antibodies (Fig. 2 F1-4). In supplementary Fig 1, the light-sheet data is
presented without the autofluorescence channel. Conclusively we observe different
spatial expression patterns, which encouraged us to expand our approach by analyzing

155

lung lobes for ACE2 and TMPRRS2 simultaneously.

ACE2 and TMPRRS2 are unequally distributed in Syrian hamster lung lobes,
160

displaying a bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom expression profile.
To assess where potential viral binding and membrane fusion can occur, co-localization
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was determined in Syrian hamster lung lobes. Substantial
staining with anti-TMPRSS2 antibody in the secondary and several tertiary bronchi is
observed (Fig. 3 A1 and supplementary Fig. 2). Signal spreading to the bronchioles and

165

alveoli can also be detected with a similar pattern to previous single stains with minor
alveolar staining at the transitioning point from bronchioles to the alveolar ducts (Fig.
3 B1 and supplementary Fig. 2 B). ACE2 expression in this double-stained non-infected
Syrian hamster lung appears to be predominantly in tertiary bronchi with minor staining
present in the primary/secondary bronchi (Fig. 3 A2 and supplementary Fig. 2 A).

170

During both single and double stainings expression of ACE2 is mainly present in the
bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 3 B2 and supplementary Fig. 2 B), (Fig. 2 B2 and B4).
There is a significant overlap of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the tertiary bronchi and
bronchioles (Fig. 3 A3/4, B3/4, supplementary Fig. 2 A/B, and supplementary video
1/2). In several regions in Fig. 3 A3/A4 and supplementary Fig. 2 A no apparent overlap

175

can be visualized, such as the primary/secondary bronchi where TMPRSS2 expression
can be seen, and conversely in several bronchioles/alveolar ducts with ACE2
expression. Thus ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are differentially expressed in the Syrian
hamster lung lobes with a top-to-bottom gradient of TMPRSS2 and a bottom-to-top
gradient of ACE2.

180
We wondered if our assessment is statistically significant. Indeed, after quantification
of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 signal in various regions in the lungs, we observe a top-tobottom gradient for TMPRSS2 and a bottom-to-top gradient for ACE2 expression (Fig.

3C). TMPRSS2 signal is predominantly present in the larger branches, with decreasing

signal intensity in the alveoli (Fig. 3D). ACE2 signal is relatively lower in the larger
branches in comparison to the alveoli (Fig. 3E).

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in whole Syrian hamster lung lobes spatially resolved.
190

To determine in which specific lung regions SARS-CoV-2 infection takes place, we
used hamster lung lobes isolated at four days post-infection, and stained these with antiNP antibodies. High signal intensity is observed in the bronchi and bronchioles with
several tertiary bronchi remaining unstained (Fig. 4 A1 and A2), with minor
fluorescence signal in the alveoli (Fig. 4 A3). Additionally, the staining pattern

195

observed with NP staining is slightly different in comparison to trimeric SARS-CoV-2
RBD staining (Fig. 2 A2 and A4), with trimeric RBD staining being present all over
the alveoli whilst anti-NP antibody binding is non-continuous (Fig. 4 A1-3). We also
analyzed the anti-NP antibody on non-infected hamster lungs and observed some
background at the major bronchi on the outside regions of the lungs, albeit with an

200

apparent lower fluorescence signal relative to the infected Syrian hamster lung (Fig. 4
B1-3 and supplementary Fig. 3 B, 4 A). This was however not the case for other NP
antibodies tested, for example, the 40143-R001 and MA1-7401 gave significant
background staining through the bronchiolar system (supplementary Fig. 4 B and C).
Thus an adequate analysis of commercial antibodies cannot be overstated, as we have

205

seen differential results with anti-ACE2 antibodies previously 19. The antibody control
(secondary antibodies) for the infected hamster lung samples displays minor
background staining without any similarity to the NP stain (Fig. 3 C1-3). Conclusively,
we can confidently detect infected regions within the whole lung lobes of infected
Syrian hamsters.

Infected Syrian hamster lungs display infection patterns that are retained to
locations where both ACE2 and TMPRRS2 co-localize.
Now with the ability to detect ACE2, TMPRSS2, and infected cells in a 3D format, we
determined the overlap of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 infection to assess if infection was
completely restricted to regions with ACE2 expression (Fig. 5 A and B). We observed

220

NP staining in several regions of the secondary bronchi extending to tertiary bronchi
and bronchioles (Fig. 5 A1 and supplementary Fig. 5 A). The primary bronchi and the
other secondary bronchi in the upper portion of the lung lobe appear to be completely

clear of infection. NP staining is observed in the alveoli, albeit at a relatively low signal
intensity (Fig. 5 B1 and supplementary Fig. 5 B), additionally over the entire lung a
225

large number of foci are present (Fig. 5 B2 and supplementary Fig. 5 B). ACE2
expression is detected again mainly in the tertiary bronchi in the lower parts of the lung
lobe (Fig. 5 A2 and supplementary Fig. 5 A). No significant signal is detected in the
primary bronchi and the other secondary bronchi also appear to express low levels of
ACE2. ACE2 patterns were strikingly similar to the NP patterns, including a major

230

overlap (Fig. 5 A3/B3, supplementary Fig. 5 A/B, and supplementary video 3/4). NP
staining appears to overlap significantly with ACE2 staining in the tertiary bronchi,
bronchioles, and alveoli (foci). However, ACE2 staining does not completely overlap
with NP staining, in the lower regions of infected Syrian hamster lung lobes there
appears to be a lack of NP staining whilst significant ACE2 staining is observed. Thus,

235

SARS-CoV-2 infection is restricted to the middle portion of the lung lobe, with
receptors in the lower parts not utilized, perhaps due to lower levels of TMPRSS2.

Next, we analyzed the spatial distribution of TMPRSS2 concerning ACE2 in infected
Syrian hamster lungs (Fig. 5 C and D). A similar expression profile is observed
240

compared to the duplicate experiment in non-infected lungs (Fig. 3). Significant
TMPRSS2 expression is detected in the primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, with
a spread to the bronchioles and alveoli, similarly to previous single and double stains
with alveolar staining at the transitioning point of the bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 5
C1/D1 and supplementary Fig. 5 C/D). ACE2 expression peaks immensely in the

245

tertiary bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli (Fig. 5 C2/D2 and supplementary Fig. 5 C/
D), with clearly lower signal in the primary and secondary bronchi (Fig. 5 C2 and
supplementary Fig. 5 C). The overlap of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is predominantly present

in the tertiary bronchi and transitioning point of the bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 5
C3/D3, supplementary Fig. 5 C/D, and supplementary video 5/6). This overlap
250

corresponds with where we observe NP staining, confirming the necessity of both
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for infection.

TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression gradients in infected Syrian hamster lungs appeared
to be near identical to non-infected hamster lungs. Whereas TMPRSS2 expression is
255

predominantly restricted to the bronchi and upper regions of the lung, ACE2 appears to
be prominently present lower in the lung lobe. We observed these gradients in multiple
different lung lobes with different staining approaches. As for the non-infected lung
lobe, after quantification, we observe a similar pattern. We observe a higher TMPRSS2
signal in the upper branches and a significantly lower signal when reaching the “Bottom

260

alveoli” (Fig. 3 C/D/E). This is also the case for ACE2 but then inverted, with decreased
ACE2 signal in the “Upper branch” and increased signal towards the “Bottom alveoli”.
We also quantified the alveolar signal in other portions of this infected and co-stained
lung the alveolar TMPRSS2 signal is dependent on the location and that alveoli in
higher regions of the lung lobe may have a higher apparent fluorescence signal (Fig. 5

265

E and F). In this example the pattern for ACE2 is similar to the pattern observed before,
an elevated signal in the alveoli and reduced fluorescence signal in the larger branches
(Fig. 3 C/D/E and 5 E/F). We additionally quantified several other staining experiments,
ACE2 fluorescence signal in the alveoli of infected hamster lung appears to be similar
in terms of fluorescence, with decreasing intensity towards the upper branches

270

(Supplementary Fig. 6 A and B). TMPRSS2 in infected hamster lobes provides a
comparable impression by displaying immense fluorescence signal in the “Upper
branch” and noticeably decreased signal in the ”Bottom-lower branch” (Supplementary

TMPRSS2 are both present in sufficient density.
275
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate distinct spatial distribution, or gradient, of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 proteins in the lung lobes of Syrian hamsters, which is considered to be the
relevant small animal model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection
280

17

. Recently, using

light-sheet microscopy, virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets was
shown by detecting NP positive cells, which formed relatively rare foci

23

. Yet the

tissues used in this preprint were significantly smaller compared to the whole lung lobes
used here. Importantly we now show the proteinaceous presence of the functional
receptor ACE2 2, and the essential restriction factor TMPRSS2 24-26, in concert with NP
285

detection. Importantly, we observed that in lung regions in which ACE2 and TMPRSS2
overlap, actual infection took place.

Ferrets and Syrian hamsters display dramatically different SARS-CoV-2 infection
profiles. Where in ferrets infection seems to be restricted to the upper respiratory tract
290

27-29

, in Syrian hamsters infection is observed throughout the respiratory tract

17,30

. In

most studies whole Syrian hamster lungs are analyzed to determine where infection
occurs, however, even whole lungs were then subjected to cutting to generate tissue
slices. Furthermore, virus titers are normally determined from whole organs sections,

Autofluorescence in grey (488 channel), co-staining in red (647 channel) and purple (730 channel), with overlapping regions
in pink (colorblind-proof).
(A) In several regions of the lung, NP staining is observed from the secondary bronchi extending to the tertiary bronchi, a topto-bottom gradient. ACE2 is again a bottom-to-top gradient, with signal in the alveoli and various tertiary bronchi. There is
major overlap of NP with ACE2 in the tertiary bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli (foci). In the lower portion of the lung there is
no apparent overlap of NP and ACE2. 0.63 zoom, voxel resolution X,Y,Z: 4.79 µm, 4.79 µm, 5 µm. (B) In the alveoli there is
significant overlap of NP and ACE2, the previously observed foci appear to be alveolar. Several NP stained foci do not
superimpose with ACE2 stained foci. 6.3 zoom, voxel resolution X,Y,Z: 0.48 µm, 0.48 µm, 2 µm. (C) The expression profile
of TMPRSS2 in infected Syrian hamster lungs is highly similar to expression in non-infected lungs. Fluorescence signal is
spreading towards the bronchioles. Likewise, ACE2 expression is also highly similar to mock lungs, with protein staining in
tertiary bronchi and bronchioles, 0.63 zoom, voxel resolution X,Y,Z: 4.79 µm, 4.79 µm, 5 µm. (D) At the transitioning point of
bronchioles and alveoli TMPRSS2 and ACE2 superimpose, whilst in the alveoli only ACE2 expression is present. 6.3 zoom,
voxel resolution X,Y,Z: 0.48 µm, 0.48 µm, 2 µm. (E) Positions chosen for quantification in the infected Syrian hamster lung
lobe from panel C, different branches and alveoli are indicated to analyze expression in the bottom part of the lung lobe and the
quantification of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 signal in the bottom regions of the infected Syrian hamster lung lobe. (F) Positions
chosen for quantification in an infected Syrian hamster lung lobe from panel C, different branches and alveoli are indicated to
analyze expression in the upper part of the lung lobe and the quantification of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 signal in the upper regions
of the infected Syrian hamster lung lobe. MP4 files of 3D render and orthoslice merges are provided.

be of interest to investigate extrapulmonary infection patterns but we also envision that
300

these approaches can be utilized for other pathogens 10,31,32.

An intriguing observation is that in previous normal lung cohorts hardly any ACE2
protein expression was observed in the human lung and bronchus 33. Indeed it is known
that ACE2 primarily resides in the alveoli, and thus in line with our light-sheet
305

microscopy observations. On the other hand, TMPRSS2 protein expression distribution
is hardly known. Transcriptomic data suggests at least low expression levels of ACE2
in respiratory cells and indicates that the co-factor TMPRSS2 is highly expressed with
broader distribution 8. We demonstrate that the TMPRSS2 co-factor indeed appears to
be present with a relatively higher abundance compared to ACE2 (Fig. 4 and 6), albeit

310

being predominantly restricted to the major lung branches in Syrian hamsters. The fact
that several studies using anti-ACE2 antibodies appeared not to correlate with infection
patterns

33,34

, and our observation of broad SARS-CoV-2 trimeric RBD binding,

indicates that infection is a process with multiple complexities.

315

Finally, it might be possible to extend our data into the increased ACE2 receptor
binding affinities of circulating variant viruses 35-37. A hypothesis would be that these
viruses can infect the upper respiratory tract, in which ACE2 is scarce, more efficiently
leading to increased transmission, a highly similar model as observed for human
influenza A viruses

320

38,39

. The protein gradient of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 can also be

discussed to this extend, whereas for a2-6 linked sialic acids, the receptor for human
influenza viruses, also displays a top to bottom gradient40. However, the biological
function of these gradients remains to be elucidated.

Methods
325
Animal tissues and ethical statement
Animals were handled in a BSL3 biocontainment laboratory. Animals were housed in
groups of 2 animals in filter top cages (T3, Techniplast), in Class III isolators allowing
social interactions, under controlled conditions of humidity, temperature, and light (12330

hour light/12-hour dark cycles). Food and water were available ad libitum. Animals
were cared for and monitored (pre-and post-infection) by qualified personnel. The
animals were sedated/anesthetized for all invasive procedures.

Animal procedures SARS-CoV-2
335

Female Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus; 6-week-old hamsters from
Janvier, France) were anesthetized by chamber induction (5 liters 100% O2/min and 3
to 5% isoflurane). Animals were inoculated with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 or PBS
(mock controls) in a 100 μl volume via the intranasal route. Animals were monitored
for general health status and behavior daily and were weighed regularly for the duration

340

of the study (up to 22 days post-inoculation; d.p.i.). Animals were euthanized on day 4
after inoculation, and lung samples were removed and stored in 10% formalin for
histopathology.

Tissue staining
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Syrian hamster lungs were obtained
from the department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Center, The
360

Netherlands. Tissue sections were rehydrated in a series of alcohol from 100%, 96% to
70%, and lastly in distilled water. Tissue slides were boiled in citrate buffer pH 6.0 for
10 min at 900 kW in a microwave for antigen retrieval and washed in PBS-T three
times. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30
min. Tissues were subsequently incubated with 3% BSA in PBS-T overnight at 4 °C.

365

The next day, the purified viral spike proteins (50 μg/ml) were added to the tissues for
1 h at RT. With rigorous washing steps in between the proteins were detected with
mouse anti-strep-tag-antibodies (IBA) and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Life
Biosciences).

methanol for 1.5 hours on a tilting laboratory shaker. Bleaching was performed
overnight at 4 °C in 90% methanol (100% v/v) and 10% H2O2 (30% v/v). Tissues were
rehydrated with 100% methanol for 1 hour, followed by 100% methanol for 1 hour,
80% methanol, 50% methanol, and 1x PBS for 1 hour on a tilting shaker. Syrian
hamster lungs were subsequently blocked for 24 hours at room temperature (22 °C) in

380

1x PBS with 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% triton-x-100, and 0.01% sodium azide (PBSGT) on a
tilting shaker. Hamster lungs were stained with trimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein
and/or with primary/secondary antibodies possessing an alexa647 or alexa750 dye.
After blocking samples were incubated for 120 hours with primary antibody or trimeric
RBD protein in PBSGT with 0.1% saponin (S2149, Sigma-Aldrich) on a shaking

385

incubator at 200 rpm, following 120 hours incubation, hamster lungs were washed with
PBSGT six times for 1 hour on a tilting shaker. Post-PBSGT wash, samples stained
with primary antibodies were incubated with secondary antibodies that possess
alexa647 or alexa750 dyes, the antibodies were diluted in PBSGT with 0.1% saponin
and filtered with 0.45 µm filter for potential antibody aggregates. Hereafter samples

were incubated for 120 hours at room temperature on a shaking incubator at 200 rpm.
Samples stained with trimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD were incubated with primary
antibody strepmabHRP (2-1509-001, IBA lifesciences) with specificity towards the
TwinStrep-tag at the C-terminus of the trimeric protein for 120 hours in PBSGT with
0.1% saponin. Following secondary antibody staining and tissues treated with trimeric

times for 1 hour on a tilting shaker. Immunostained samples were subsequently treated
400

with 50% methanol for 24 hours, 80% methanol for 24 hours, 100% methanol for 24
hours followed by 100% methanol for 24 hours on a tilting shaker for dehydration of
the lungs. Hereafter lipid solubilization was performed with dichloromethane
(Thermofisher, 402152) for 40 minutes after which refractive index matching and
optical clearing were performed overnight with dibenzyl ether (108014, Sigma-

405

Aldrich).

Light-sheet microscopy
Light-sheet imaging was performed using the Ultramicroscope II (LaVision BioTec)
equipped with an MVX-10 Zoom Body. The laser lines 488 nm (Coherent OBIS 488410

50 LX Laser 50mW), 647 nm (Coherent OBIS 647-120 LX Laser 120mW), and 730
nm (Coherent OBIS 730-30 LX Laser 30mW) were used with 70% laser power for 488
channel, 70% laser power for the 647 channel and 100% laser power for the 730 nm
channel. Emission filters ET525/50 (488 channel), ET676/29 (647 channel) and 716/40
(730 channel) filter was used with a Neo 5.5 sCMOS detector (2560x2160 pixels, pixel

415

size: 6.5 x 6.5 µm2). A corrected dipping cap (CDC) (1.26x – 12.6x) was utilized with
an Olympus MVPLAPO 2x objective lens. Imaging was performed with 0.63 zoom and
step size of 5 µm (voxel resolution X, Y, Z: 4.79 µm, 4.79 µm, 5 µm), also with 6.3
zoom and step size of 2 µm (voxel resolution X, Y, Z: 0.48 µm, 0.48 µm, 2 µm). The
exposure time was set to 200 ms and illumination for the 0.63 zoom was bidirectional

420

and 6.3 zoom unidirectional. The sheet numerical aperture was 0.033 with a sheet
thickness of 7.09 µm and sheet width of 40%. The imaging chamber was filled with
dibenzyl ether and the microscope software is Inspector version 7.1. Obtained image
stacks were analyzed with ImageJ v1.54f and Imaris 9.6. Stills of image slices

425

TIFF files generated by the light-sheet microscope were imported to ImageJ with “File
-> Import -> Bio-formats”, stack is viewed as “Hyperstack” color mode was set to
“Composite” and “Display metadata” with “Display OME-XML metadata” was
enabled to obtain voxel information. Brightness adjustments were performed for each
channel with setting “Image -> Adjust -> Brightness/Contrast”. The 488 channel color

430

was set to hex code #FFFFFF, the 647 channel was set to hex code #FF0000 and the
730 channel was set to hex code #8080FF. Snapshots of the Z-stack were saved as
JPEGs and the orthoslice animations with “Save As -> Avi -> Compression JPEG and
Frame Rate 30 FPS”. For the 3D renders obtained imaging data was imported into
Imaris, display adjustments were made for each channel. Snapshots and animations

435

were made with 3D renders (3D View) within Imaris. Volume mode was set to
maximum intensity projection (MIP) and the rendering quality was set to highest.
Frame settings were used for the outer bounding box of the 3D render, “Box”,
“Tickmarks”, and “Axis labels” were enabled. The spacing of the tickmarks was set to
µm 500 for the X, Y, and Z-axis. The 488 channel color was set to hex code #FFFFFF,

440

the 647 channel was set to hex code #FF0000 and the 730 channel was set to hex code
#8080FF. The 3D animations were made with 1920 x 1080 resolution (16:9) and 360
frames, 360° horizontal turn.

Quantification
445

For TMPRSS2 and ACE2 quantification surfaces and masks were generated in Imaris
with the “Surfaces Creation Wizard” (according to the reference manual). In this
surface/mask regions of interest were selected, i.e. the branches and alveoli in the
hamster lung. Regions of interest were selected in the surface tool with the

corresponding source channel, whereby the 647 channel with TMPRSS2 signal was
450

used for TMPRSS2 and ACE2 double-stained samples and 730 source channel for
ACE2 and anti-NP double-stained samples. For the TMPRSS2 single stained sample,
the 647 channel was used as the source channel. Thresholding (Absolute Intensity) was
performed arbitrarily to obtain complete coverage of the alveoli and branches. The
automatically provided value for “Sphere Diameter” was used. For the separation of

455

two or more objects that are identified as one, the “Split touching Objects (Region
Growing)” setting was utilized. The “Seed Points Diameter” value was set to 35 µm.
The generated surfaces were subsequently used to mask the TMPRSS2 and ACE2
channels, after which statistical values were obtained and exported to GraphPad Prism
9.
