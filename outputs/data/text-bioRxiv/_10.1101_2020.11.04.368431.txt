Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 causes the novel pandemic Pneumonia
disease. It is a positive single strand ssRNA virus that infect human. COVID-19 appeared
in Egypt in Feb 2020.The samples were taken from patients with COVID-19 symptoms at
military hospital in Egypt and transported to the main chemical laboratories under all the
biosafety measures according to WHO guidelines. All samples were tested with RT-PCR.
Positive samples were cultured using VeroE6 cell lines. The propagated virus was isolated
and inactivated .The isolated virus was sequenced using next generation sequencing and
submitted into gene bank .This study provides an isolation , propagation and inactivation
methodology which is valuable for production of inactivated vaccines against SARSCoV2 in Egypt.
Key words: RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; COVID 19; VeroE6; Inactivated Vaccine.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 caused a pandemic disease called
COVID-19.The COVID-19 appeared in China in 2019(Zu. et al, 2019).Egypt become
infected on Feb 2020 with SARS-CoV2(Abd El Dayem, Waleed A. 2020).The pandemic
virus consists of a positive single strand ssRNA. The spike protein of the virus is
responsible for virus attachment with cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme two
(ACE2).The genome of SARS-CoV2 consists of two major portions(Ana S., et al 2020).
The first is the genes responsible for replication ORF1a and ORF2b.The second portion is
the genes coded for structural proteins like membrane, nucleocapsid, spike and envelope

proteins. We identified the samples as positive SARS-CoV2 with RT-PCR. We used
VeroE6 as cell line to propagate and isolate the virus. This study provides Identification,
Isolation and Propagation methodology that enable researchers in Egypt to propagate
SARS-CoV2 in high-titer for vaccine development and anti-viral drug screening.
Materials and Methods
Sampling
Oropheringial swabs were taken from symptomatic patients with COVID-19 from military
hospital. The samples transferred, under full biosafety measures, in transportation media
(sterile DMEM purchased from sigma Aldrich cat no. with ampicillin100IU/ml,
streptomycin 100μg/ml) at 4 °C in biosafety transporting device to main chemical
laboratories at ALMAZA-Cairo.
Identification using RT-PCR
The RNA of all samples extracted using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were handled under a
biosafety cabinet(germfree biosafety cabinet, SEA- III, 316 ss ) according to laboratory
biosafety guidelines main chemical laboratories in chemical warfare department,Egyptain
army.
Molecular Identification was done using SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR detection KIT high
profile. (Cat # VS-NCO212H) according to the manufacture instructions. The master mix
was rehydrated with 15µL of rehydration Buffer and 5 µL of RNA of thermally treated
and untreated samples were added ( samples were run in triplicates) , positive and
negative controls ( provided with the kit ) were included in each test to judge the quality of
amplification. Real time RT-PCR was done using Ariamx thermal cycler (Agilent,
Germany) with the following parameters, reverse transcription step at 45oC/15 minute,
followed by initial denaturing and enzyme activation step at 95oC/2 minute, then 45
cycled of denaturing at 95°C/10 sec and annealing/extension 60 °C/50 seconds with
florescence collected at the end of this step.

Propagation and Isolation
All the positive samples were were diluted with viral transfer medium containing
Oropheringial swabs and antibiotics (Nystadin, penicillin-streptomycin 1:1 dilution) at 1:4
ratio and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C, before being inoculated onto VeroE6. Inoculated
VeroE6 cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in 1× Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Virus
replication and isolation were confirmed through cytopathic effects and RT-PCR. Viral
culture of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in a biosafety Level-3 facility according to
laboratory biosafety guidelines (germfree biosafety cabinet, SEA- III, 316 ss) according to
laboratory biosafety guidelines of main chemical laboratories in chemical warfare
department, Egyptian army.
Inactivation
The Infected VeroE6 cells were scraped from the flask then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10
minute. The cell pellet was rinsed with 0.1M phosphate buffer saline (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA) centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Pellet was fixed 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer Saline at pH 7.4 for at least two hours at room temperature.
Virus solution was added to Amicon Ultra 50,000 KDa NMWL (Cat No. UFC9003) and
centrifuge at 4,000xg for 15 minutes to wash from excess glutaraldehyde. The sample was
diluted with 1ml of PBS and centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4,000xg. The sample was diluted
with 1ml of PBS and centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4,000xg. The concentrator was transferred
to a clean tube and centrifuge at 1,000xg for 2 minutes to collect the concentrated sample.
The sample was diluted in serum physiologic.
Results:
Molecular Identification with Real Time PCR
Samples used in the current study were collected from clinically morbid patients with the
classical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 including hyperthermia (>38.5°C) dyspnea, dry

Propagation of SARS-CoV2 on VeroE6 cell line.
The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the SARS-CoV2 on the cells was followed and observ

from the day 1 to day 4 after inoculation .Increasing cytopathic effects were record
orded
(Fig no 1). We wanted to identify the propagation of the virus as SARS-CoV-2 using
g RT
PCR along with SARS-CoV-2 N gene and orf1 gene. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the
propagated samples was proved in table 1 as we mention before. After a compl
plete
molecular identification of SARS-CoV2 with real time PCR (chart 1 &2), we sequence
ced a
full genome of the virus for some sample and submitted into gene bank (access

method, we wanted to evaluate this inactivation process. Therefore, we inoculated the
inactivated SARS-CoV2 again on VeroE6 cell line and did not observe any CPE.
Discussion and Conclusion:
SARS-CoV2 are enveloped ssRNA viruses that were distributed among humans in all over
the world in 2019(Ahmadi, et al. 2020). This infection cause respiratory, enteric and
neurological diseases (Fang, et al.2020).The emergence of coronaviruses at regular
intervals poses an important threat to human health and economy of countries. This
emphasizes the urgent need to develop effective vaccines to prevent future outbreaks and
therefore isolation and inactivation of the SARS-CoV2 viruses become important issues.
In the process of specimen collection from patient and transfer to the laboratory, the
process should be started and virus cultured immediately because lots of virus became
inactivated. Therefore, we use transfer solutions, infection medium used in propagation
process, to safe infectious SARS-CoV-2 during the transportation. We identified the
SARS-CoV2 with real time PCR depending on orf1 and N genes detection according to
RT-PCR kit. In addition, before inoculation the virus on the cells, we wash the cells with
FBS free media to remove excess of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then, to propagate virus,
cells were suspended with a virus media including 2% FBS. Afterwards, we observed
cytopathic effects from day 1 to day 5 after inoculation. Inactivation of SARS-CoV2 was
done by the process we mentioned before to inactivate the virus for being used as
inactivated vaccine but after complete consideration of inactivation vaccine production
criteria.
As a conclusion, this study can be referenced for researchers in Egypt who aimed to
propagate and isolate SARS-CoV-2 to work in vaccine production, genomics, sequencing,
proteomics, gene editing like CRISPR and anti-viral drug screening.
