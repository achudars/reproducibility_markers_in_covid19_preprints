Abstract
A coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) was constructed containing 11 SARS-CoV-2, 5 SARS-1,
5 MERS, and 12 seasonal coronavirus recombinant proteins. The array is designed to measure
immunoglobulin isotype and subtype levels in serum or plasma samples against each of the individual
antigens printed on the array. We probed the COVAM with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)
collected from 99 donors who recovered from a PCR+ confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results
were analyzed using two computational approaches, a generalized linear model (glm) and Random
Forest (RF) prediction model, to classify individual specimens as either Reactive or Non-Reactive
against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. A training set of 88 pre-COVID-19 specimens (PreCoV) collected
in August 2019 and102 positive specimens from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 cases was
used for these analyses. Results compared with an FDA emergency use authorized (EUA) SARSCoV2 S1-based total Ig chemiluminescence immunoassay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS® AntiSARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and with a SARS-CoV-2 S1-S2 spike-based pseudovirus micro
neutralization assay (SARS-CoV-2 reporter viral particle neutralization titration (RVPNT) showed high

concordance between the 3 assays. Three CCP specimens that were negative by the VITROS
CoV2T immunoassay were also negative by both COVAM and the RVPNT assay. Concordance
between VITROS CoV2T and COVAM was 96%, VITROS CoV2T and RVPNT 93%, and RVPNT and
COVAM 95%. The discordances were all weakly reactive samples near the cutoff threshold of the
VITROS CoV2T immunoassay. The multiplex COVAM allows CCP to be grouped according to
antibody reactivity patterns against 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Unsupervised K-means analysis, via
the gap statistics, as well as hierarchical clustering analysis revealed 3 main clusters with distinct
reactivity intensities and patterns. These patterns were not recapitulated by adjusting the VITROS
CoV2T or RVPNT assay thresholds. Plasma classified according to these reactivity patterns may be
better associated with CCP treatment efficacy than antibody levels alone. The use of a SARS-CoV-2
antigen array may be useful to qualify CCP for administration as a treatment for acute COVID-19 and
to interrogate vaccine immunogenicity and performance in preclinical and clinical studies to
understand and recapitulate antibody responses associated with protection from infection and
disease.

Background
Following exposure and recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, convalescent patients develop
antigen specific adaptive T- and B-cell immune responses including binding and neutralizing
antibodies (Ab). These immune responses may prevent reinfection or blunt the clinical consequences
of future infectious exposures to the virus. Administration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)
from recovered patients is being employed for therapeutic use based on the belief that factors,
including neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2, present in the plasma may inhibit virus replication and
improve patient outcomes.
Numerous clinical trials are underway aimed at understanding how best to administer CCP and
to test the hypothesis that it is an effective treatment. A significant clinical trial involving more than
35,000 CCP treated COVID-19 patients has shown an efficacy signal from plasma with elevated Ab
levels in patients treated within a few days after symptom onset [1]. Previous efforts to use
convalescent plasma for treatment of infectious diseases have produced mixed results, possibly
associated with differences in the antibody profile from different donors. Differences in the breadth
and level of SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab in CCP may correlate with therapeutic efficacy. Consequently,
investigated the performance of a Coronavirus Antigen Microarray (COVAM) in order to characterize
and classify Ab reactivity in CCP before it is administered to patients.
COVAM is a multiplex assay platform for high-throughput serological studies. The microarrays
are produced by printing validated and purified recombinant antigens on nitrocellulose-coated slides.
The COVAM has 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens, 5 SARS-1, 5 MERS and 12 seasonal coronavirus
antigens, as well as 35 antigens from 5 other viruses that cause acute respiratory infections [10,11]. A
complete list of the COVAM antigens can be found in Supplementary Table 1. The arrays are
designed to determine the Ab profile in serum or plasma samples to confirm prior exposure following
suspected infection with the viruses and to monitor Ab changes over time. The arrays are designed
for high throughput and low-cost testing and hence are suitable for epidemiology studies as a
serologic surveillance tool to determine the prevalence and levels of Abs indicating viral exposure
within individuals over the course of an epidemic.
Here we probed the COVAM with CCP collected from 99 donors between 4/18/2020 –
5/6/2020 from 8 regions across the US. Although the donors were all recovered SARS-CoV-2 PCR+
COVID-19 cases, their Ab response profiles against 11 SARS-CoV-2 fell into distinct groups with
different Ab levels and breadth of the responses particularly to 4 SARS-CoV-2 antigens. If these
classification groups correlate with CCP efficacy, a SARS-CoV-2 antigen microarray may be useful to
qualify CCP for treatment of acute COVID-19.

Methods
Specimen Testing on Coronavirus Antigen Microarray
The COVAM slides were probed with human plasma and analyzed as described elsewhere (Jain
et. al.,2016; Nakajima et. al., 2018 and Khan et al., 2019) . Briefly, the specimens were diluted 1:100
in 1X Protein Array Blocking Buffer (GVS Life Sciences, Sanford, ME), transferred to the slides and
incubated overnight at 4°C. The slides were then washed 3 times for 5 minutes each with t-TBS buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 in ddH2O adjusted to pH 7.5 and filtered) at room
temperature (RT). Then, anti-human IgG and anti-human IgA secondary Ab were added to each pad
at a dilution of 1:100 (in Protein Array blocking Buffer) and incubated for 2h at RT under agitation. Pads
were then washed with t-TBS 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried. The slides were imaged using
ArrayCam imager (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR). In order to measure non-specific binding of the
secondary Ab, pads were incubated without the previous addition of human sera. The data acquisition
and spot quantification were performed using the Scan ArrayExpress (V 3.0, PerkinElmer) software [2,
8-9].
Specimen Sources and prior Characterization
In order to build the prediction models, a collection of samples with known exposure status to
SARS-CoV-2 was used as a training set. This set was composed of 88 PreCoV specimens derived
from frozen plasma components collected by Vitalant in July-September 2019, and 102 specimens
from PCR confirmed cases was used for these analyses. These confirmed positive cases include 45
serum samples from the University of California Irvine collected between 7 and 25 days after the
symptom onset; 30 samples from the University of California San Francisco collected between 2 and
38 days after the symptoms onset; 13 samples from Basel collected between 13 and 50 days after the
symptoms onset and 14 samples from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics collected between 7 and 22 days after
the symptoms onset. The CCP samples were a collection of 99 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma
samples from the Vitalant system collected between 4/18/2020 – 5/6/2020 from 8 regions across the
US.
Neutralization titers were measured as 50% neutralization (NT-50) by endpoint titration using a
recombinant viral-particle neutralization test (RVPNT) and a cutoff equal to 1:40. The VITROS CoV2T
chemiluminescent immunoassay assay was performed using either serum or plasma samples from
Vitalant Research Institute (San Francisco, CA) according to the manufacturer instructions [3]. The test
targets the spike protein and applies a predefined threshold value of 1.0 signal-to-cutoff (S/C) for IgG
seropositivity but has a broad dynamic range with S/C values as high as 1000.

Data Analysis
All data analysis was performed in the R programing environment (Version 4.0.2).
Quantile normalization
After data acquisition, data normalization was performed by the Quantile Normalization method
using the “normalize.quantiles.use.target” function of the “preprocessCore” package (Version 1.50.0).
As reference for normalization, a collection of known positive and known negative samples (training
set comprised of serial samples from recovered COVID-19 patients and plasma collected in the JulySeptember 2019, respectively) was used.
Cluster analysis
To investigate the different reactivity profiles, the data were clustered and divided based on the
reactivity to the 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens. For the clustering, first the optimal number of clusters was
estimated by the gap statistics on the K-means clustering analysis (“fviz_nbclust” function from the
factoextra package (version 1.0.7). Then, a Hierarchical Clustering analysis (“hclust” function, method
“ward.D2”, from the “stats” package, version 4.0.2) was performed and the dendrogram cut in order to
obtain a number of cluster defined by the previous calculated gap statistics. The assigned groups
were obtained by cutting the dendrogram to obtain K = n groups, where n is the optimal number of
clusters obtained from the gap statistics analysis.
Principal component Analysis (PCA) was also performed (“prcomp” function from the “stats”
package version 4.0.0 as well as the “fviz_nbclust” function from the “factoextra” package, version
1.0.7)
Reactivity classification
With goal of predicting exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the samples were first classified based on
their overall reactivity profile. The prediction was performed using two main computational methods, a
logistic regression model and a random forest prediction model.
For the logistic regression, a generalized linear model (“logit” family) was first generated (“glm”
function from the “stats” package version 4.0.2) using the training set of. Then a receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC) was generated in order to obtain all the curve coordinates. This allows
estimation of the specificity and sensitivity for each point of the curve and therefore defines an optimal
cutoff point of the regression analysis fitted values. For the predictions described in this work, the
model was built using four antigens: SARS-CoV-2 S1, SARS-CoV-2 S1.HisTag, SARS-CoV2.S1.RBD, SARS.CoV.2.S1+S2. The test samples are then submitted to the logistic regression
analysis and the fitted values compared to the defined cutoff for classification (positive or negative).
For the random forest analysis, like the logistic regression method, a model fit is generated
(random forest version 4.6-14). For the random forest model, seven antigens were used: SARS-CoV-

Results
COVAM, RVPNT and VITROS CoV2T chemiluminescent immunoassay assay concordance
The COVAM has 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens, 5 SARS-1, 5 MERS and 12 seasonal coronavirus
antigens. The complete list of the COVAM antigens, in the order displayed in the figures, is available
in Supplementary Table 1. We probed COVAM with CCP collected from 99 US PCR confirmed
COVID-19 plasma donors who recovered from the infection one to two months prior to CCP
collection. The multiplex COVAM results were analyzed using two computational approaches, either a
generalized linear model (glm) or Random Forest (RF) to classify individual specimens as either
Reactive or Non-Reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The binary prediction results were
compared with the FDA EUA VITROS CoV2T chemiluminescence immunoassay from Ortho
(reactive: S/C≥1.0) and with an RVPNT assay (reactive: neutralization titer with >5) inhibition of
infection [NT50] > 40) developed at Vitalant and tabulated in Table 1.

Compared to the VITROS CoV2T assay, there is 93%, and 96% concordance with the
RVPNT, and COVAM predictions, respectively. Three specimens that were negative by the VITROS
CoV2T assay were also negative by COVAM and RVPNT assays. Ninety-one specimens (92%) are
completely concordant among all comparisons, including 88 seropositive by all tests and 3
seronegative by all tests. All of the discordances are found in 8 samples that showed low positive titer
on the VITROS CoV2T immunoassay. Among these 8 samples, 7 were considered non-reactive on
the RVPNT test and 4 considered non-reactive on the COVAM prediction (using a 60% RF probability
cutoff).
The COVAM data are summarized in the heatmap in Figure 1. There are 99 specimen IDs
along the x-axis and 65 antigens along the y-axis (Supplementary Table 1). The antigens are grouped
according to the virus from which they are expressed. The top 11 antigens are from SARS-CoV-2 and
the quantitative COVAM IgG Ab results from these antigens were used to cluster the specimens into
3 groups as shown in the dendrogram on top of the heatmap (Figure 1).
The vsn normalized reactivities of individual antigens printed on the COVAM array can be
correlated with the VITROS CoV2T immunoassay S/C values as well as the RVPNT titers. The
results of correlation analysis for the S1 Spike antigen in the COVAM array, are shown in Figure 2.
The normalized signal intensity on the COVAM for each antigen is plotted in a scatterplot against the
either the VITROS CoV2T S/C levels or the RVPNT NT50 titers. The COVAM reactivity of this antigen
correlates to the VITROS CoV2T S/Cs and to the RVPNT NT50 titers with Spearman’s r = 0.65 and r
= 0.655, respectively. A summary of Spearman r values for each of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 COVAM are
plotted in Figure 2b. Antigens that contain the RBD domain and lack the S2 domain correlate best.
The COVAM reactivity against the nucleocapsid protein NP and the S2 domain of spike do not
correlate with the VITROS S1 based CoV2T or the RVPNT assays, which is reasonable since Abmediated neutralization of virus entry is primarily based on blocking interactions between the RBD
domain of S1 and ACE-2 receptors expressed on target cells in the assay.

CCP specimens cluster into 3 distinct groups according to Ab levels against SARS-CoV-2 antigens
Although there is concordance in the binary predictions of the 3 assays, the multiplex COVAM
assay allows for a multivariant cluster analysis metric to classify CCP into different groups based on
their reactivity patterns against several antigens. The VITROS CoV2T or RVPNT assays produce a
single value for each specimen and a binary (reactive or non-reactive) result when that value is above
or below a reactivity threshold, with quantitation of Ab intensity above the S/C = 1.0 and NT50 = 40
categorical thresholds. The COVAM interrogates IgG levels against 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens and
uses a computational algorithm to determine a binary outcome by comparing the results to the
training set of COVID positive and negative controls.

Unsupervised cluster analysis can sort the specimens according COVAM antigen specific IgG
reactivity patterns into at least 3 distinct groups based on the level of antibodies against a collection
of NP, Spike, S1, S2 and RBD antigens (Figure 1). Group 1 specimens have high Ab levels against
many of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens, most markedly high reactivity to nucleocapsid protein (NP), S1
domain of spike protein, and the full spike S1+S2 protein. Group 3 specimens have very low antibody
levels to NP and S1 compared to the Group 1 specimens. The Group 2 specimens show an
intermediate reactivity level against spike antigens. The horizontal bars on top of the heatmap
indicate reactive (red) and non-reactive (blue) predictions for each specimen for the VITROS CoV2T,
RVPNT and COVAM assays. All of the predicted non-reactive specimens from all three assays are in
group 3. All of the group 1 and 2 specimens are reactive and concordant by all 3 assays.
The results in Figure 3 show the IgG heatmap clustered (k-means), using the reactivity of the
SARS-CoV-2 antigens, into these 3 groups. PCA analysis shows 3 distinct groups and the bar graphs
confirm that Ab levels against each antigen differ significantly between each group. The heatmap and
its dendrogram (Figure 3) indicate that the specimens in each group can be further split into
subgroups. Figure 4 separates Group 1 specimens into 2 subgroups (1.1 and 1.2) evident from the
heatmap (Figure 4a) and confirmed by the PCA (Figure 4c). The bar graph (Figure 4b) highlights a
significant difference between subgroups 1.1 and 1.2 in reactivity against antigen S2 which is
elevated in Group 1.2. Figure 5 separates Group 2 specimens into 2 subgroups (2.1 and 2.2)
evident from the heatmap (Figure 5a) and confirmed by PCA (Figure 5c). The bar graph (Figure 5b)
highlights a significant difference between subgroups 2.1 and 2.2 against the nucleocapsid protein
and S2 which are both elevated in Group 2.2). Figure 6 separates Group 3 specimens into 2 groups
(3.1 and 3.2) evident from the heatmap (Figure 6a) and confirmed by PCA (Figure 6c). From the bar
graph and heat map it is evident that the reactivity of group 3 specimens is less than that of the other
two groups, but the subgroup 3.2 is particularly lacking in antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

Multiplex antigen classification of CCP
The efficacy of CCP may vary depending on the donor, and there are different ways to classify
the plasma before it is administered. One criterion is whether the donor was a PCR+ confirmed case.
Factors such as clinical disease severity and the time from symptom onset or recovery to collection of
CCP units may contribute to the classification. Antibody level is a measurement that can be used to
qualify CCP and antibodies against different antigen targets including the total spike S1/S2, S1, S2,
RBD and NP proteins can be considered. Virus neutralization assay titers are another metric and
pseudoviruses have been developed for this purpose to make it more convenient than live SARSCoV-2 virus neutralization assays for routine use. In order to use these quantitative measurements to

qualify CCP for clinical administration, a threshold can be established, to qualify a unit of plasma as
acceptable for clinical use or rejected.
A multiplex antigen classification of CCP can also be considered as a criterion to qualify and
accept or reject donor plasma for transfusion to COVID-19 patients. For example, all of the highly
reactive COVAM Group 1 specimens (Figure 3) could be accepted and all of the low reactive Group
3 specimens rejected. Or subsets of any of the groups (Figure 4-6) could be accepted or rejected
based on knowledge of the clinical efficacy of each major group or subgroup
The results plotted in Figure 7 show how multiplex antigen classification differs from criteria
based on changing the binary threshold of a single assay. In Figure 7A the RVPN titer threshold was
moved from the canonical standard 40, to 160, 320 and 640. Group 3 specimens increasingly fall
below the cutoff as the threshold increases. Group 2 specimens are mostly above threshold at the
160 threshold and increasingly fall below the threshold as it is increased. Interestingly, all but one of
the Group 1 specimens are below the highest RVPNT threshold of 640.
The VITROS CoV2T assay threshold can also be adjusted to select the specimens with higher
signals (Figure 7B). Moving the S/C threshold from 1 to 10 preferentially removes a high proportion
of the low-level reactive Group 3 specimens. At the highest threshold of 150 all of the Group 3
specimens are removed while 40% and 30% of the Group 1 and 2 specimens, respectively, are
above the threshold.
These assay-dependent and threshold-dependent differences in the classification of plasma
specimens is further evident from the results in Figure 8. Here the group 1, 2 and 3 specimens were
separately sorted by the RVPNT titer (Figure 8A). The Titer Cutoff lines on Figure 8A shows how
most of the Group 1 samples are above the threshold even at the highest 640 titer. The Group 2 and
Group 3 specimen classifications are affected more by increasing the Cutoff titer. Similarly, the
VITROS CoV2T data is plotted in Figure 8B and 3 different assay cutoff values are shown. It is
evident that the VITROS CoV2T intensity is not well correlated to the RVPNT titer, and scatterplots
(not show) give R2 = 0.037. Increasing the VITROS CoV2T threshold cuts through all the groups.
These results indicate that RVPNT titer, VITROS CoV2T titer, and the COVAM multiplex cluster
analysis patterns select different collections of plasma specimens.

Discussion
Passive antibody transfer using convalescent plasma has previously been used to treat
infectious diseases that involve the respiratory system including influenza [4-7]. Prior experience in
epidemics with convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies to viruses has demonstrated variable
indications of therapeutic efficacy against Influenza, Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever, and SARS.
Characterizing antibody titers in plasma to viruses has indicated a correlation with therapeutic
efficacy. An Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) clinical trial led by the Mayo Clinic has been completed
resulting in >65,000 units of apheresis plasma collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients and
treating >35,000 acutely infected COVID-19 in-patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in donor
plasma are variable, and a small statistically significant (p<0.05) improvement in the clinical outcome
was reported in a subset of patients who were treated early after symptom onset and received the
plasmas with higher Ab titers compared to patients who received plasma later in the disease course.
The results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 specific Ab content of CCP may be associated with better
clinical outcomes in the appropriate patient subset. Definitive safety and efficacy of CCP for the
treatment of COVID-19 is awaiting completion of placebo controlled, prospective and randomized
clinical trials (RCTs).
Clinical serodiagnostic tests usually measure antibody levels against a single antigen or
epitope and a single Ig isotype. The output of current EUA SARS-CoV-2 Ab assays are a binary
positive/negative, above or below a threshold with or without reporting intensity of reactivity levels
above the threshold. The assay cutoff threshold is determined by probing a well-characterized
collection of positive and negative control samples. Some tests of this type mix multiple antigens
together and use secondary Abs that recognize multiple isotypes to produce an aggregate value with
a binary positive/negative result.
Methodologies like COVAM that quantitatively interrogate multiple specific signal intensity
levels independently to classify specimens were called “chemometrics” in the pre-genomic period.
Modern multivariant statistical approaches that interrogate and classify a “fingerprint” of individual
genomic measurements have been developed to classify genome sequence and expression data,
and these computational methods can also be applied to clinical diagnostics. The test results from the
COVAM assay described here take advantage of multivariant machine learning, pattern recognition,
and clustering to classify plasma samples that have many antibodies at different levels against
numerous SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
The COVAM was constructed to independently measure immunoglobulin isotype and subtype
levels in serum or plasma samples against each of the individual antigens printed on the array. We
use two computational approaches, either a generalized linear model (glm) or a Random Forest (RF)

prediction model to classify individual specimens as either Reactive or Non-Reactive against the
SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We use a training set of 88 PreCoV specimens collected in July-September
2019 and positive specimens from PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 cases. We evaluated 99 coded CCP
plasma samples and produced binary positive/negative results that were 96% concordant with the
FDA EUA Ortho VITROS CoV2T immunoassay and 93% with the RVPNT assay. All of the
discordances were weak responders around the threshold of the comparators.
Although the binary classification of COVAM, VITROS CoV2T and RVPNT assays are highly
concordant, multivariant COVAM analysis of quantitative results reveals distinct differences among
the 99 CCP specimens analyzed in this study. Unsupervised K-means analysis, as well as
hierarchical clustering reveal 3 main clusters with distinct reactivity intensities and patterns. The
dendrogram analysis reveals at least 2 additional subgroups within each of the major groups that
separate based on reactivity patterns against the antigens on the array. We could not recapitulate
these group classifications by simply moving the reactivity thresholds of either the VITROS CoV2T or
RVPNT assays.
The variable reactivity patterns between individuals observed in this study is suggestive of
polyclonal immune responses with different antibody specificities which should be examined in light of
clinical outcomes in recipients of CCP transfusions; if predictive the COVAM assay could be
employed to qualify CCP for administration as a treatment for acute COVID. The use of a SARS-CoV2 antigen array of this kind could also be useful to interrogate vaccine performance in preclinical and
clinical studies in order to understand Ab responses associated with protection from acquisition of
infection, and prediction of clinical severity of disease in vaccine breakthrough infections. An analysis
to identify antibody patterns associated with treatment efficacy can be done retrospectively on
aliquots from plasma that have already been used for treatment in ongoing clinical trials of CCP and
vaccines.
