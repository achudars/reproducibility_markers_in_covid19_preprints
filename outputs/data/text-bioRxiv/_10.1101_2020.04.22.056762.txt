Abstract

51

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used in treating

52

COVID-19 patients recently. However, both drugs have some contradictions

53

and rare but severe side effects, such as hypoglycemia, retina and cardiac

54

toxicity. To further uncover the toxicity profile of CQ and HCQ in different

55

tissues, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of them in 8 cell lines, and further

56

adopted the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) to predict

57

the tissue risk respectively. Retina, myocardium, lung, liver, kidney, vascular

58

endothelium and intestinal epithelium originated cells were included in the

59

toxicity evaluation of CQ and HCQ respectively. The proliferation pattern was

60

monitored in 0-72 hours by IncuCyte S3, which could perform long-term

61

continuous image and video of cells upon CQ or HCQ treatment. CC50 and

62

the ratio of tissue trough concentrations to CC50 (RTTCC) were brought into

63

predicted toxicity profiles. The CC50 at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h of CQ and HCQ

64

decreased in the time-dependent manner, which indicates the accumulative

65

cytotoxic effect. HCQ was found to be less toxic in 7 cell types except

66

cardiomyocytes H9C2 cells (CC50-48 h=29.55 μM; CC50-72 h=15.26 μM ).

67

In addition, RTTCC is significant higher in CQ treatment group compared to

68

HCQ group, which indicates that relative safety of HCQ. Both CQ and HCQ

69

have certain cytotoxicity in time dependent manner which indicates the

70

necessity of short period administration clinically. HCQ has the less impact in 7

71

cell lines proliferation and less toxicity compared to CQ in heart, liver, kidney

Introduction

84

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was

85

first emerged in China and has spread globally due to its high transmissibility and

86

infectivity, resulting in an unprecedented global public health challenge (1, 2). As of

87

April 20, 2020, more than 2,400,000 cases have been confirmed around the world,

88

according to data supplied by Johns Hopkins University, and at least 58,000 people

89

have died from the disease (2). Judging from current status, most patients have a good

90

prognosis, nevertheless approximately 20% of the patients with COVID-19

91

experienced critical complications, including arrhythmia, acute kidney injury,

92

pulmonary edema, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

93

(3-6). Apart from primarily inflammation in the lungs, it is also suggested that other

94

vital organs like kidneys, heart, gut, as well as liver, were also suffered severe damage

95

according to the autopsies, suggesting that individuals or older with chronic

96

underlying diseases appear to have a higher risk for developing severe outcomes.

97

Such huge numbers of infected people call for an urgent demand of effective and

98

available drugs to manage the pandemic. Unfortunately, at present, there are still no

99

specific antiviral drugs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recent

100

publications have demonstrated that chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)

101

efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro assay (7-9). CQ, together with its

102

derivate HCQ, has been commercialized as antimalarial drugs in the clinic for several

103

decades. HCQ has also been broadly used in autoimmune diseases treatment, such as

104

systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthtitis (10-13). Several clinical

105

trials have confirmed that both CQ and HCQ were superior to the control group in

106

inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, as well

107

as promoting the virus negative conversion and shorten the disease course.11

108

Moreover, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved CQ and

109

HCQ for emergency use to treat hospitalized patients for COVID-19. Although

110

exhibiting apparent efficacy and acceptable safety profile for COVID-19 treatment,

111

CQ and HCQ still have some potential concerns with prolonged usage, including

112

heart rhythm disturbances, gastrointestinal upset, retinal toxicity, in particular for

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056762; this version posted April 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

113

retinopathy(11, 14-17). Additionally, Risambaf et al. found that CQ/HCQ may

114

increase the risk of liver and renal impairment when it used to treat COVID-19(18).

115

Toxicity tolerability in key tissues about drug effectiveness and side effect were

116

critical to understand their mechanism and to optimize dosing regimen by integrating

117

predicted tissue concentrations (TCs) of both drugs in patients. Therefore, comparison

118

of tissue tolerable concentration and predicted concentration in each given tissue and

119

cell line scan be utilized to suggest dosing optimizing strategy for patients infected by

120

COVID-19, especially in high risk populations. In current study, 8 different types of

121

cell lines including retina, myocardium, lung, liver, kidney, vascular endothelium and

122

intestinal epithelium originated cells were included in the cytotoxic evaluation with

123

the presence of CQ or HCQ in 0-72 h on Incucyte S3 device, which could perform

124

long-term continuous imaging and provide the cellular proliferation pattern upon drug

125

treatment. Consequently, the selectivity index (SI= CC50/TCs) of CQ and HCQ

126

combined with the predicted tissue concentration based on PBPK model was

127

calculated at the given target organ, respectively. The data suggest that HCQ was

128

demonstrated to be much less toxic than CQ, at least at certain key tissues (heart, liver,

129

kidney, and lung). Taken together, this study provides the information regarding

130

cytotoxicity in a wide spectrum and will be beneficial for both pharmacologists and

131

physicians.

Results

134

The effect of CQ on cell proliferation

135

To gain the more comprehensive cytotoxic information upon CQ and HCQ treatment,

136

we chose 8 different types of cell lines, which included IMR-90, A549, ARPE-19,

137

Hep3B, Vero, HEK-293, H9C2and IEC-6. This panel includes the normal diploid cells,

138

transformed and tumor cell lines which can represent different originated tissue to

139

some extent. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of CQ in the given cell lines list above, we

140

treated them with different dosing regimens of CQ range from 0.017 to 1000 μM. In

141

order to better monitor the effect of CQ on cell viability and proliferation within 0-72

142

hours, we used the long-term dynamic cell image acquisition device Incucyte S3,

143

which can take photos of cells in each group every three hours. Then the confluence

144

of each group was measured and analyzed by these photos compared with control

145

group. Results from in vitro cytotoxicity study showed that CQ exhibited significant

146

cytotoxic at 48 h when the dosing regimens was more than 30 μM. CQ was found to

147

decrease the cell proliferation of in a dose-dependent manner. When the concentration

148

of CQ was more than 300 μM, most of the 8 cell lines showed immediate toxicity

149

within three hours (Figure 1). Among these 8 cell lines, Hep3B, HEK-293, IMR-90,

150

and IEC-6 are more sensitive to CQ.

151
152

The effect of HCQ on cell proliferation

153

Data from previously reported showed that HCQ also have good antiviral activity for

154

both treatment and pretreatment choice against SARS-CoV-2 (9). So, in the same way

155

as in vitro assessment of CQ toxicity, we also test the effect of HCQ on the viability

156

and proliferation of 8 cell lines. Results from the in vitro cytotoxicity study showed

157

that HCQ exhibited significant cytotoxic at 48h when the dosing regimens was more

158

than 100 μM. HCQ inhibited the viability of Vero cells, IMR90, A549, H9C2,

159

HEK293, Hep3b and ARPE19 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Among the

160

8 cell lines, H9C2 and IEC-6 is the most sensitive cell line to HCQ based on the

161

CC50-48 h (Figure 2).

162
163

CC50 of CQ and HCQ

164

Cytotoxicity tests were carried out in 8 types of cell lines respectively, which is

165

IMR-90, A549, ARPE-19, Hep3B, Vero, HEK-293, H9C2, and IEC-6 cells and the

166

results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. In this study, CC50 values (half

167

cytotoxicity concentration) for CQ and HCQ were measured at 48 h, 72 h respectively.

168

Both CQ and HCQ show strong and immediate toxicity on all 8 cell lines upon

169

treatment more than 300 μM of CQ or HCQ. As shown in Figure 1 and 2, when the

170

concentration of CQ or HCQ is higher than 300 μM, the proliferation shows a sudden

171

decline or brake compared with lower dosing regimens. H9C2 (heart) 、

172

HEK293( kidney), and IEC-6 (intestine), are the more sensitive cells to CQ compared

173

with 5 other cell lines, as their CC50 value at 72 h are less than 20 μM (17.1μM,

174

16.76 μM, and 17.38 μM respectively).

175

activity on Vero and ARPE-19 cell lines with CC50 values of 92.35 μM, and 147.0

176

μM at 72 h, respectively. Similar with CQ, HCQ exhibits strong cytotoxicity on H9C2

177

and HEK-293 with CC50 values at 72 h lower than 20 μM (15.26 μM and 15.26 μMat

178

72 h, respectively). HCQ exhibits weak cytotoxic activity on Vero and ARPE-19 cell

179

lines with CC50 values of 56.19 μM, and 72.87 μM at 72h, respectively.

180

The CC50 on 24 h, 48 h, 72 h of CQ and HCQ decreased in a time-dependent manner,

181

which suggests the cumulative toxic effect in most of the 8 cell lines except Vero. As

182

shown in Table 1, the CC50 value of 72 h increased instead of decrease compared

183

with that of 48h in Vero, which may be due to special drug metabolism or stability in

184

it. As the selection index (SI) is the safe range to evaluation the drug effect.

185

Considering that the anti-SARS-CoV activity EC50 of HCQ (EC50 = 0.72 μM) is

186

lower than that of CQ (EC50 = 5.47 μM), and the CC50 of HCQ is lower than that of

187

CQ in most kinds of cell lines (such as Hep3B, A549, IMR-90, HEK-293 and IEC-6

188

shown in Table 1) (9). Therefore, we can preliminarily conclude that the selectivity

189

index (SI) of HCQ is higher than that of CQ in most cell types.

Additionally, the CQ exhibits mild cytotoxic

190
191

PBPK Model and Risk of Toxicity

192

Using our PBPK models, we simulated the tissues concentrations of HCQ (600 mg

193

BID for 1 day, 200 mg BID for day 2 to 5) and CQ (500 mg BID for 7 days) (19, 20).

194

The Cmax of tissue concentrations were summarized in Table 2. Results of simulated

195

tissue concentration showed that tissue trough concentration of CQ in liver and lung

196

reached the highest level of drug accumulation (227.545 μg/ml), which is 3 times

197

more than that in heart (60.598 μg /ml). However, the tissue trough concentration of

198

HCQ in lung is the highest level (25.633 μg/ml) compared with liver, kidney and heart

199

(Table 2 and Figure 4).

200

In order to better predict the toxicity risk of CQ and HCQ in different tissues, we used

201

the ratio of simulated tissue trough concentration to CC50 (RTTCC) to predict the risk

202

of tissue toxicity for the safety profile of these two drugs in the given tissues. As

203

shown in Figure 3, we systematically compared the toxicity between CQ and HCQ,

204

the RTTCC value of CQ is 6-87 times more than that of HCQ in lung, heart, kidney and

205

liver, which suggests that the toxicity risk of HCQ in the above tissues is much lower

206

than that of CQ.

207
208

Discussion

209

CQ and HCQ, widely-used as antimalarial and autoimmune diseases drugs,

210

recently have been reported that both of them can be used for the treatment of

211

COVID-19 infected patients. As they may block SARS-CoV-2 invasion by inducing

212

the formation of expanded cytoplasmic in vitro (7-9, 21, 22). In addition, the glycosylation

213

inhibition, together with the pH elevation of endosomes and lysosomes, might be also

214

attributed to their potential antiviral mechanisms (4, 23-25). In addition, the latest

215

findings about HCQ in the application of COVID-19 infected patients suggest that

216

rather than the anti-virus activity, both of them can prevent the cytokine storm by

217

suppressing the immune response (26, 27) . Nevertheless,

218

HCQ is an attractive strategy for COVID-19 emergency. Therefore, the potential

219

toxicities of these medications, including gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous

220

reactions, cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, in particular retinopathy, are urgent to pay

221

special attention, especially for those elders with underlying diseases.

repurposing of CQ or

222

Our results revealed that both CQ and HCQ have shown certain cytotoxicity in 8

223

different types of cell lines in time and dose dependent manner in vitro, suggesting the

224

necessity of short period administration clinically. Among these types of cell lines, it

225

does show the different tolerant capacity manifested by varied CC50 value. For

226

example, the most cytotoxic effect was found in Hep3B (hepatocarcinoma cell line)

227

and IEC-6 (intestinal epithelial cells) treated by CQ, while the A549 (lung cancer) ，

228

IMR90 (human embryo lung fibroblast cells) and IEC-6 (intestinal epithelial cells)

229

upon HCQ treatment. Although the cytotoxicity was obtained by live cell imaging

230

system in vitro, this cellular toxic response of CQ and HCQ may refer to the tissue

231

-toxicity or vice versa to some extent. The PBPK models for CQ and HCQ were

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056762; this version posted April 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

232

developed using Simcyp simulator (version 18). Physical and chemical parameters

233

were obtained as previously reported. The lung to blood concentration ratio for CQ

234

and HCQ (obtained from animal studies) was used to predict the drug concentration in

235

the lungs, heart, liver, and kidney. To better investigate the potential toxicity in vivo

236

and in vitro, we proposed RTTCC (ratio of tissue concentration and CC50) derived from

237

PBPK model to predict the risk of toxic profiles in different tissues. We compared the

238

RTTCC data collected from heart, liver, kidney, lung, and revealed HCQ has shown

239

significantly safe profiles than that of upon CQ treatment (9). However, recent

240

publication reported that CQ was safer than HCQ according to SI (7, 9). We speculate

241

that the safety difference might be due to their complex pharmacokinetic

242

characteristics in vivo, which possessed specific distribution and long half-life of

243

around days. In short, based on our just published study, we further developed the

244

novel parameters to predict the potential toxicity besides the traditional selectivity

245

index (SI), (the ratio of the CC50 to EC50), which is a commonly accepted to measure

246

the window between cytotoxicity and antiviral capacity (9). As a result, our data

247

shows that kidney, lung and heart are prone to the toxicity of CQ, otherwise lung and

248

kidney are relative vulnerable upon HCQ treatment (Figure 5). In the meantime,

249

considering the un-negligible effect on cardiocytes and retina cells, of which the most

250

patients with the severe symptoms are more likely suffered the dysfunction in heart

251

and eye sight with aging simultaneously. Therefore, ECG monitoring should be

252

necessary during clinical usage, even for the patients only infected with COVID-19

253

but without the underlying diseases. In addition, the more attention should be paid to

254

the patients in the changes of their eye sight when using HCQ.

255

In this study, we perform dynamic imaging system to accurately and precisely

256

monitor the whole proliferation process other than conventional CCK8 assay.

257

Furthermore, RTTCC value suggests that drug distribution should be took in account

258

with the assessment of its potential toxicity within the tissues. Despite of no

259

agreements have been reached on the effectiveness of these candidate drugs in the

260

prevention or treatment of COVID-19, our study could provide more details, new

261

evaluating parameters and deep insight into the safety profile of CQ and HCQ in

Figure 1. Chloroquine inhibited the viability of the 8 cells in a dose-and timedependent manner. CQ inhibited the viability of Vero E6 cells, IMR90, A549, H9C2,
HEK293, Hep3b, ARPE19 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. These cells were
seeded at a density of 3000-5000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and maintained in
regular medium for 72 hours, with different concentration including including 0.01 µM,
0.03 µM, 0.1 µM, 0.3 µM, 1 µM, 3 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, 300 µM, 1000 µM,
respectively. The cell proliferation was assessed by confluence measurements
normorlized to 0 hour calculated using IncuCyte (Essen BioScience).The experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Figure 2. Hydroxychloroquine inhibited the viability of the 8 cells in a
dose-and time-dependent manner. HCQ inhibited the viability of Vero, IMR90,
A549, H9C2, HEK293, Hep3b, ARPE19 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner.
These cells were seeded at a density of 3000-5000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and
maintained in regular medium for 72 hours, with different concentration including 0.01
µM, 0.03 µM, 0.1 µM, 0.3 µM, 1 µM, 3 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, 300 µM, 1000
µM, respectively. The cell proliferation was assessed by confluence measurements
normorlized to 0 Hour calculated using IncuCyte (Essen BioScience).The experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Figure 3 The CC50 of CQ and HCQ of 8 different cells in vitro. The CC50 (half
cytotoxic concentration) of CQ and HCQ were measured by in vitro dynamic
imaging system (IncuCyte S3) through monitoring the cell convergence analysis at
0 to 72 h. CC50 of CQ and HCQ at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h were analyzed as indicated.

Figure 4. Predicted the risk of cytotoxicity in different tissue by RTTCC based on
tissue concentration derived from PBPK model. A. Analysis of ratio of tissue
trough concentration vs CC50 in 6 cells based on CQ, HCQ tissue concentration
simulated by the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) model by
blood data after intravenous administration; B. Compare of RTTCC CQ, HCQ to
predict the risk of cytotoxicity in different tissues.
