Abstract

24

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of RNA viruses that typically cause respiratory, enteric and

25

hepatic diseases in animals and humans. Here, we used porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)

26

as a model of coronaviruses (CoVs) to illustrate the reciprocal regulation between CoVs infection

27

and pyroptosis. For the first time, we clarified the molecular mechanism of porcine Gasdermin D

28

(pGSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis and demonstrated that amino acids T239 and F240 within

29

pGSDMD-p30 are critical for pyroptosis. Furthermore, 3C-like protease Nsp5 from SARS-CoV-2,

30

MERS-CoV, PDCoV and PEDV can cleave human/porcine GSDMD at the Q193-G194 junction

31

upstream of the caspase-1 cleavage site to produce two fragments which fail to trigger pyroptosis

32

or inhibit viral replication. Thus, we provide clear evidence that coronoviruses may utilize viral

33

Nsp5-GSDMD pathway to help their host cells escaping from pyroptosis, protecting the

34

replication of the virus during the initial period, which suggest an important strategy for

35

coronoviruses infection and sustain.

Introduction

38

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive single-strand RNA viruses which belong to the

39

family of Coronaviridae. These viruses can cause enteric, respiratory or hepatic diseases in both

40

human and other mamals1. According to serological and genotypic characterizations, CoVs are

41

divided into four genera, including Alphacoronavirs (α-CoV), Betacoronavirus (β-CoV),

42

Gammacoronavirus (γ-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV)2,3. As a member of the

43

Alphacoronavirus genus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was first identified in Europe in

44

1971 which characterized by severe diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting and high mortality in suckling

45

piglets4. A highly virulent PEDV reemerged in China in 2010 and spread rapidly in the USA in

46

2013, causing enormous economic losses to the global pig farming industry5-7. The viral genome

47

of PEDV is approximately 28 kb and encodes an accessory protein, two polyproteins and 4

48

structural proteins. Most of synthesized polyproteins are cleaved by nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5),

49

a 3C-like protease encoded by ORF1a, and the protease activity of Nsp5 is essential for PEDV’s

50

replication. Nsp5 from different CoVs share highly conserved amino acid sequence which makes

51

Nsp5 as an ideal broad-spectrum antiviral target8,9. It has been reported that 3C-like protease of

52

different viruses, including foot-and-mouth disease (FMDV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and

53

enterovirus 71 (EV71), can antagonize innate immune signaling pathways by disrupting one or

54

more components of the IFN-inducing pathways10-14. For coronaviruses, PEDV Nsp5 antagonizes

55

type I IFN signaling by cleaving the nuclear transcription factor kappa B essential modulator

56

(NEMO)

57

mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (pDCP1A) at Q343 to facilitate its replication16. A recently

58

published study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 can cleave TAB1 and NLRP12 at two

59

distinct cleavage sites17. Although many studies have demonstrated the immune evasion strategies

60

of coronaviruses, the molecular mechanism between coronaviruses replication and the innate

61

immune response remains poorly understood.

Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death which characterized by cell swelling, pore

63

formation in the plasma, lysis and releases of cytoplasmic contents18,19. This type of inflammatory

64

cell death functions as an innate immune effector to antagonize pathogenic microorganisms.

65

Recent studies identified Gasdermin D (GSDMD) as an executioner of pyroptosis, which is

66

cleaved and activated by caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/1118-20. Upon caspase-1/4/5/11 cleavage, the

67

N-terminus of GSDMD (GSDMD-p30) can bind to lipids and phosphatidylethanolamine to form

68

pores at 10-20 nm in size and drive to pyroptosis21-23. Under the condition of pathogen infection,

69

the pyroptosis helps the host eliminating infected cells and thereby restricts proliferation of

70

intracellular pathogens24-26. On the other hand, the 3C-like protease of EV71 virus can facilitate its

71

replication by inhibiting pyroptosis through further cleaving the active GSDMD-p3027. However,

72

the relationship between coronaviruses infection and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis has not been

73

fully illustrated.

74

In this study, we used PEDV as a model of CoVs to investigate the relationship between CoVs

75

infection and pyroptosis. We found that the pGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis protected host cells

76

against PEDV infection. However, during the early stage of infection, Nsp5 of PEDV directly

77

cleaved pGSDMD at the Q193-G194 junction and produced two inactive fragments, which do not

78

inhibit PEDV replication. Furthermore, we found Nsp5 from other coronaviruses, such as PDCoV,

79

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, had activity to cleave both hGSDMD and pGSDMD to inhibit

80

GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Therefore, these results demonstrated a previously unknown

81

mechanism of coronaviruses to escape from the pyroptosis of innate immune responses.

Results

83

PEDV infection induces the degradation of pGSDMD. Since GSDMD was reported as a key

84

effector for pyroptosis, many studies had been performed on human and murine GSDMD, but

85

studies focusing on pGSDMD and its function against pathogenic infection were rare. To

86

investigate the role of pGSDMD on pathogenic infection, the amino acid sequence of pGSDMD

87

was predicted and aligned with other GSDMD homologs from human and mouse (Extended Data

88

Fig. 1), and polyclonal antibody against pGSDMD was prepared as previously described

89

(Extended Data Fig. 2)28,29.

90

To determine whether PEDV infection targets pGSDMD, IPEC-J2 cells were infected with

91

PEDV at indicated time points. Cell death was evaluated by LDH release. The results showed that

92

pyroptosis was inhibited at early timepoints post infection (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, PEDV

93

infection induced degradation of pGSDMD in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were

94

observed in Vero cells transfected with plasmid encoding pGSDMD and infected with PEDV (Fig.

95

1C and D). In addition, the degradation of pGSDMD induced by PEDV infection increased in an

96

MOI-dependent manner in IPEC-J2 and Vero cells (Fig. 1E and F). These results indicate that

97

pyroptosis and pGSDMD expression are both inhibited by PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells and

98

Vero cells.

99
100

Caspase-1 cleaves pGSDMD at residue D279-G280 and induces pyroptosis. We next

101

investigate whether pGSDMD could induce pyroptosis. Therefore, porcine caspase-1 (pCaspase-1)

102

and pGSDMD gene were amplified and cloned into vectors to construct recombinant plasmids and

103

then the plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, co-transfected

104

with plasmids encoding pCaspase-1 and pGSDMD significantly increased the LDH release in

105

HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A). To further confirm the results, the cells were collected and stained with

106

PI, and then analyzed with Fluorescence microscopy and Flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 3A

107

and B). Both results showed that co-transfection with plasmids encoding pCaspase-1 and

108

pGSDMD led to increased cell death. These results indicate that co-expression of pGSDMD and

109

pCaspase-1 could induce pyroptosis in HEK293T cells.

110

The cells were also collected to detect pCaspase-1 mediated cleavage of pGSDMD by Western

111

blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, cell lysates co-transfected with HA-caspase-1 and

112

p3×Flag-N-GSDMD-FL had a faster-migrating protein band (about 35 kDa) and cell lysates

113

co-transfected with HA-caspase-1 and p3×Flag-C-GSDMD-FL had a smaller protein band (about

114

25 kDa). These results show that pCaspase-1 could cleave pGSDMD to generate an N-terminal

115

(about 30 kDa) and a C-terminal (about 20 kDa).

116

Based on the sizes of the cleaved protein bands and the cleavage site preference of caspase-1,

117

the D254-G255 and D279-G280 pairs were tested as the potential cleaved sites for pCaspase-1.

118

Hence, we constructed two mutants in which D was replaced with A. As shown in Fig. 2C and D,

119

wild-type pGSDMD, the D254A mutant and the D279A mutant were co-transfected with

120

pCaspase-1, followed by LDH release assays and PI staining assays. Both results showed that

121

mutation of D279 resulted in significantly decreased pyroptosis, while mutant of D254 showed no

122

significant change, which suggested pCaspase-1 cleaved pGSDMD at residue D279-G280. The

123

Western blotting analysis of the cell lysates was consistent with this result (Fig. 2E), in which the

124

wild-type pGSDMD and the D254A mutant were cleaved by pCaspase-1 and the D279A mutant

125

was resistant to the cleavage. The results indicate that pCaspase-1 cleaves pGSDMD at residue

126

D279-G280 and generated an N-terminal (GSDMD1-279) which could induce pyroptosis (Fig. 2F).

127

To further validate the results, plasmids encoding pGSDMD1-279 was constructed and

128

transfected into HEK293T cells. The LDH release assays showed that pGSDMD1-279 individually

129

induced pyroptosis (Fig. 2G). Thus, the above results suggest that pGSDMD is cleaved by

130

pCaspase-1 at residue D279-G280 and then generate an N-terminal (p30) which could induce

131

pyroptosis and a C-terminal (p20) (Fig. 2H).

132
133

L295/Y378/A382 are the key sites for pGSDMD autoinhibition. It has been reported that the

134

residues C38/C39 and C191/C192 (human/murine) are essential for oligomerization of

135

GSDMD-N terminal21,30. Hence, we next examined whether these key sites also existed on

136

pGSDMD. Based on the multiple-sequence alignment of pGSDMD, hGSDMD and murine

137

GSDMD (mGSDMD) (Extended Data Fig. 1), residues C38 and S191 were tested as the potential

138

key sites for pGSDMD to oligomerize and they were replaced with A to construct point mutants.

139

HEK293T cells were transfected with these point mutants, LDH release results showed that C38A

140

and S191A did not show inhibitory effects on pyroptosis (Fig 3A). However, we further evaluated

141

the oligomerization of pGSDMD-p30 following treatment of NSC and NSA (two specific

142

inhibitors for oligomerization of hGSDMD-p30)30,31. As shown in Fig. 3B, the results showed that

143

both NSC and NSA inhibited the pyroptosis induced by porcine/human GSDMD-p30 (Fig. 3B),

144

suggesting that there are residues which impact the oligomerization of pGSDMD-p30 and still

145

required further exploration in the future.

146

Earlier reports have demonstrated that full length of hGSDMD and mGSDMD have an

147

autoinhibitory structure, in which GSDMD-C terminal inhibits the activity of GSDMD-N terminal

148

to induce pyroptosis23,30. Based on the multiple-sequence alignment, L295, Y378 and A382 of

149

pGSDMD formed a pocket which associated with GSDMD-N terminal according to the homology

150

modeling results (Fig. 3C). Thus, the three residues were tested as the potential sites in pGSDMD.

154

mutated into D (GSDMD-FL-3D). The mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells, and results

155

showed that all of the mutants had the activity to induce pyroptosis (Fig. 3D). However, there

156

were no statistic differences between 2D and 3D (Fig. 3E). The aforementioned results suggest

157

that L295, Y378 and A382 are the critical sites for autoinhibitory structure of full length of

PEDV Nsp5 associates with and cleaves pGSDMD. To investigate the relationship between

full-length (pGSDMD-FL) and GSDMD N-terminal (pGSDMD-p30) and then infected with

163

PEDV. The LDH release assays results showed that PEDV infection had an inhibition effect on

164

pyroptosis induced by pGSDMD-p30 (Fig. 4A). Meanwhile, the replication of PEDV was also

165

inhibited significantly by pyroptosis induced by pGSDMD-p30 (Fig. 4B). These results suggest

166

that there might be reciprocal regulation between PEDV and the pGSDMD-p30-mediated

pyroptosis.

171

pGSDMD to suppress pyroptosis. As shown in Fig. 4C, HEK293T cells were transfected with

172

PEDV Nsp5 or pGSDMD-p30, or co-transfected with these two recombinant plasmids. The

173

supernatants were collected at different time points and tested for LDH release. The results

174

showed that the expression of PEDV Nsp5 inhibited pyroptosis induced by pGSDMD-p30 (Fig.

175

4C). For further validation, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in Fig. 4D,

176

and the Western blotting results showed that there was a faster-migrating protein band (about 25

177

kDa) in samples co-transfected with PEDV Nsp5 and p3×Flag-N-GSDMD-FL (Fig. 4D, lane 6),

178

and there were two cleavage protein bands, of 35 kDa (p30) and 25 kDa respectively, in samples

179

co-transfected with HA-caspase-1, PEDV Nsp5 and p3×Flag-N-GSDMD-FL (Fig. 4D, lane 7).

180

These results implied that pGSDMD was a target cleaved by PEDV Nsp5. To further confirm the

181

pGSDMD cleavage mediated by PEDV Nsp5, p3×Flag-N-GSDMD-FL was co-transfected with an

182

increasing dose of PEDV Nsp5 into HEK293T cells. Western blotting results showed that

183

pGSDMD cleavage progressively increased in a PEDV Nsp5-dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4E).

184

We next investigated the colocalization of pGSDMD and PEDV Nsp5 with confocal microscopy.

185

As shown in Fig. 4F, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids as shown and the protein

186

localization were examined after 24 h. An indirect immunofluorescence assay showed that

187

pGSDMD and Nsp5 colocalized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4F). The CoIP experiments also

188

demonstrated that PEDV Nsp5 interacted with and cleaved pGSDMD (Fig. 4G).

189

To further investigate whether PEDV Nsp5 cleaves pGSDMD by means of its protease activity,

190

two Nsp5 mutants, H41A and C144A, which disrupted the protease activity of Nsp58,32-34, were

191

constructed and co-transfected with p3×Flag-N-GSDMD-FL into HEK293T cells. As shown in

192

Fig. 4G, wild-type Nsp5 cleaved pGSDMD successfully, while the two mutants failed to cleave

193

pGSDMD (Fig. 4H). Nevertheless, CoIP experiments showed that the loss of protease activity of

194

Nsp5 did not impact its interaction with pGSDMD (Fig. 4I). Hence, the protease activity of PEDV

195

Nsp5 is essential for pGSDMD cleavage but not interaction.

196
197

PEDV Nsp5 cleaves pGSDMD at residue Q193-G194. We next examined the sequence of

198

pGSDMD for potential PEDV Nsp5 cleavage site. Logo analysis of the cleavage site predicted

199

from the polyprotein cleavage of PEDV Nsp5 was shown in Fig. 5A. Based on the substrate

200

preference of Nsp5 and the sizes of the cleaved bands, the Q193-G194, Q195-G196 and

201

Q197-G198 pairs were tested as the potential cleaved sites35,36. Therefore, these three Q residues

202

were replaced with A and these three mutants pGSDMD-Q193A, pGSDMD-Q195A,

203

pGSDMD-Q197A were co-transfected with vector or PEDV Nsp5. As shown in Fig. 5B, Western

204

blotting results showed that pGSDMD-Q193A was resistant to PEDV Nsp5-mediated cleavage,

205

while pGSDMD-Q195A and pGSDMD-Q197A were not (Fig. 5B), suggesting that PEDV Nsp5

206

cleaves pGSDMD at residue Q193-G194 junction (Fig. 5C).

207

PEDV Nsp5 cleaves pGSDMD to generate pGSDMD1-193 and pGSDMD194-488, and pCaspase-1

208

cleaves pGSDMD at residue D279. Thus, we next investigated whether these cleaved fragments of

209

pGSDMD1-193, pGSDMD194-279 and pGSDMD194-488 can induce pyroptosis. As shown in Fig. 5D,

210

these three truncated mutants were separately transfected into HEK293T cells and results showed

211

that none of them induced pyroptosis (Fig. 5D). Meanwhile, since the protein band of

212

pGSDMD194-279 was too small to be visualized, we subsequently cloned them into EGFP-tagged

213

vectors and then transfected them into HEK293T cells. The results further confirmed that these

214

three truncated mutants cannot induce pyroptosis (Extended Data Fig. 4). Next, we further

215

examined whether pCaspase-1 could associate with and cleave these three truncated mutants. As

216

shown in Fig. 5E and F, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids as indicated, and the

217

results of CoIP assay and Western blotting assays showed that pCaspase-1 could associate with

218

and cleave full-length of pGSDMD, but had no interaction with pGSDMD1-193, pGSDMD194-279

219

and pGSDMD194-488.

220

As described in the preceding text, pyroptosis of cells induced by pGSDMD-p30 had an

221

inhibition effect on PEDV replication. Therefore, we next investigated whether PEDV

222

Nsp5-mediated cleavage of pGSDMD impacts its antiviral activity. Vero cells were transfected

223

with plasmids encoding vector, pGSDMD-FL, pGSDMD-p30, pGSDMD1-193, pGSDMD194-279 and

224

pGSDMD194-488. At 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.5 for

225

another 24 h, and then total RNA was extracted and the viral RNA level of PEDV were evaluated

226

by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 5G, there was no statistical differences among

227

vector, pGSDMD-FL, pGSDMD1-193, pGSDMD194-279 and pGSDMD194-488, indicating that the

228

antiviral activity of fragments cleaved by Nsp5 were nearly abolished (Fig. 5G). In summary, the

229

above results demonstrate that the antiviral activity of pyroptosis induced by pGSDMD-p30 are

230

impaired by PEDV Nsp5-mediated cleavage, which emphasizes the importance of pGSDMD

cleavage on PEDV replication.

232
233

Amino acids T239 and F240 are two key sites for pGSDMD-p30 to induce pyroptosis. It has

234

been shown that pGSDMD1-279 (pGSDMD-p30) can induce pyroptosis, while pGSDMD1-193

235

cannot. Based on this, we conjectured that the active motif of pGSDMD to induce pyroptosis

236

located at the amino acids between 193 and 279. Thus, we constructed a series of pGSDMD

237

truncated mutants which encoding pGSDMD1-254, pGSDMD1-244, pGSDMD1-234, pGSDMD1-224,

238

and pGSDMD1-214, and transfected them into HEK293T cells. As shown in Figure 6A and B,

239

pGSDMD1-279 (pGSDMD-p30), pGSDMD1-254 and pGSDMD1-244 can induce pyroptosis, while

240

pGSDMD1-234, pGSDMD1-224, pGSDMD1-214 cannot (Fig. 6A and B), indicating that the key sites

241

located between amino acids 234 and 244. Hence, the amino acids between 234 and 244 were

242

replaced by D and these point mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells as shown in Fig. 6C.

243

The results showed that all of the point mutants, except T239D and F240D (Fig. 6C), can induce

244

pyroptosis, suggesting that T239 and F240 are the essential sites for pGSDMD-p30 to induce

245

pyroptosis. The results were further proved by PI staining assay (Extended Data Fig. 5). Notably,

246

the point mutant R238D can inhibit the release of LDH but cannot inhibit the intake of PI,

247

suggesting that the mutation of R238 led to smaller pores on cell membrane than wild type

248

pGSDMD-p30.

249

To further investigate the effects of T239D and F240D on viral replication, the two mutants

250

were transfected into Vero cells along with vector, pGSDMD-FL and pGSDMD-p30, and 24 h

251

after transfection, cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.5 and then the replication of

252

virus were tested by quantitative real-time PCR. As presented in Fig. 6D, in contrast to

253

pGSDMD-p30, neither T239D nor F240D could inhibit the replication of PEDV (Fig. 6D), further

254

confirming that inhibition of pyroptosis induced by pGSDMD-p30 is essential for PEDV to

255

replicate.

257

GSDMD is a common substrate of different coronaviruses Nsp5. Next, we tested whether

258

Nsp5 encoded by other genera of CoVs can cleave GSDMD. Multiple-sequence alignment

259

showed that Nsp5 of PDCoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were highly similar to PEDV Nsp5

260

(Extended Data Fig. 6), especially their catalytic domain (Fig. 7A). Thus, the Nsp5 of PDCoV,

261

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV were cloned into empty vector and co-transfected with pGSDMD,

262

and the Western blotting results showed that all these Nsp5 can cleave pGSDMD (Fig. 7B). To

263

further confirm the results, we respectively constructed point mutants of these Nsp5 which did not

264

show protease activity. As shown in Fig. 7C, PDCoV Nsp5 can cleave pGSDMD while its mutants

265

cannot (Fig. 7C). Likewise, the wild-type Nsp5 of SARS-CoV-2 cleaved both pGSDMD (Fig. 7D)

266

and hGSDMD (Fig. 7E), while its mutants did not. Similar results were observed for cleavage of

267

pGSDMD and hGSDMD by MERS-CoV Nsp5 (Fig. 7F and G). The results above suggest that

268

GSDMD is a common substrate of different genera of coronaviruses Nsp5. To further validate this

269

conclusion, we analyzed the peptides GAVSLQ(193)↓GQGQGH (pGSDMD, arrow represents

270

cleavage site) and Nsp5 of PEDV (Fig. 8A), SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 8B), MERS-CoV (Fig. 8C) and

271

PDCoV (Fig. 8D), peptides GATCLQ(193)↓GEGQGH (hGSDMD, arrow represents cleavage site)

272

and Nsp5 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 8E) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 8F) by homology modeling37,38. As

273

shown in Fig. 8, the residues of both pGSDMD and hGSDMD comfortably fit in the Nsp5 pockets

274

of different CoVs, suggesting a strong interaction between them.

275
276

Discussion

277

Although considerable progress has been made in CoVs research, knowledge gaps still exist with

278

respect to the host innate immune responses against CoVs infection. Here, we used PEDV as a

279

model of CoVs to illustrate the relationship between CoVs infection and pyroptosis (Fig. 9). We

280

demonstrated that the pGSDMD plays a protective role against PEDV infection. At early time

281

points after PEDV infection, pGSDMD was cleaved by Nsp5 to produce two inactive fragments

282

which failed to trigger pyroptosis and inhibited PEDV replication. The pGSDMD-p30 could

283

inhibit PEDV replication, and the amino acids T239 and F240 determined its inhibitory effect.

284

Furthermore, Nsp5 of other genera can also cleave hGSDMD and pGSDMD to produce inactive

285

fragments. Thus, our results demonstrated that GSDMD may be an appealing target for the design

286

of anti-coronavirus therapies.

287

Recent studies have identified that human/murine GSDMD is a direct substrate of

288

caspase-1/4/5/11 and serves as the executioner for pyroptosis. However, the amino acids sequence

289

and molecular characterization of pGSDMD have not been illustrated. In order to investigate the
10

290

role of pGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in PEDV infection, we first clarified the molecular

291

characterization of pGSDMD. Porcine GSDMD has 488 aa and can be cleaved by porcine

292

caspase-1 at D279 to produce GSDMD-NT (p30, 1-279 aa), which lead to pyroptosis.

293

Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that C38/C39 and C191/C192 (human/murine)

294

mutations impaired hGSDMD-p30/mGSDMD-p30 oligomerization, which is critical for

295

hGSDMD-p30/mGSDMD-p30 during pore formation22,30. However, our results indicated that

296

mutation of porcine C38 or S191 (corresponding to human C38 and C191) had no effect on

297

p30-induced pyroptosis. Interestingly, inhibitors of hGSDMD-p30 oligomerization could also

298

abrogate pGSDMD-p30-induced pyroptosis. The results suggest that other critical site(s)

299

determine(s) pGSDMD-p30 oligomerization. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that T239 and

300

F240 within pGSDMD-p30 are critical for inducing pyroptosis.

301

Generally, the 3C-like protease of CoVs is critical for viral replication by cleaving polyprotein

302

precursors to produce mature nonstructural proteins. However, the 3C-like protease has also

303

acquired mechanisms to evade host innate immune responses. It is reported that CoVs Nsp5 can

304

antagonize innate immune signaling pathways by disrupting one or more components of the

305

IFN-inducing pathways10-12. Our present study first demonstrated that CoVs Nsp5 can subvert

306

innate immune responses by cleaving and inactivating GSDMD. Thus, GSDMD represents a

307

novel target of CoVs Nsp5. PEDV Nsp5 not only interacted with and cleaved full length of

308

pGSDMD, but also abrogated pGSDMD-p30-induced pyroptosis by cleaving the p30 fragment.

309

Conversely, protease-dead mutants of the four CoVs Nsp5 were unable to cleave human/porcine

310

GSDMD. Thus, these results suggest a reciprocal regulation between CoVs Nsp5 and pyroptosis.

311

It is noteworthy that CoVs Nsp5 cleaves human/porcine GSDMD at the Q193-G194 junction.

312

Our results suggest that amino acids T239 and F240 within pGSDMD-p30 are critical for

313

pyroptosis. These two sites within pGSDMD-p30 determine CoVs replication. Upon cleavage by

314

CoVs Nsp5, the truncated N-terminal fragment without T239 and F240 sites failed to induce

315

pyroptosis or inhibit viral replication. Interestingly, a newly published study demonstrated that

316

Zika virus (ZIKV) protease directly cleaved the hGSDMD into N-terminal fragment (1-249),

317

which contains T239 and F240. ZIKV NS2B3 protease cleaves hGSDMD at residue R249 to

318

produce hGSDMD1-249 fragment, which lead to pyroptosis in a caspase-independent manner39.

319

Consistent with this, a previous study demonstrated that NS5 protein of ZIKA could directly
11

320

interact with NLRP3 protein and facilitate NLRP3 inflammasome activation40, which is an

321

upstream event for hGSDMD-p30-mediated pyroptosis. Therefore, viruses use different strategies

322

to evade host immune responses and facilitate its replication.

323

In summary, we used PEDV as a model of coronaviruses to illustrate the reciprocal regulation

324

between CoVs infection and pyroptosis. For the first time, we clarified the molecular mechanism

325

of pGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and demonstrated that amino acids T239 and F240 within

326

pGSDMD-p30 are critical for pyroptosis. Furthermore, 3C-like protease Nsp5 from SARS-CoV-2,

327

MERS-CoV, PDCoV and PEDV can cleave human/porcine GSDMD at the Q193-G194 junction

328

upstream of the caspase-1 cleavage site to produce two fragments which fail to trigger pyroptosis

329

or inhibit viral replication. Thus, we provide clear evidence that the coronoviruses might utilize its

330

Nsp5 to escape the host pyroptotic cell death in favor of its replication during the initial period, an

331

important strategy for their sustaining infections. Further work is needed to investigate the role of

332

GSDMD in viral pathogenesis.
