ABSTRACT

SARS-CoV-2 exhibits significant experimental and clinical gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiac muscle
tropisms responsible for local tissue-specific and systemic pathophysiology capriciously occurring in about half
of COVID-19 patients. The underlying COVID-19 mechanisms engaged by these extra-pulmonary organ systems
are largely unknown. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing that neutral amino acid transporter
B0AT1 (alternately called NBB, B, B0 in the literature) is a common denominator expressed nearly exclusively
by three particular cell types: intestinal epithelia, renal proximal tubule epithelium, and cardiomyocytes. B0AT1
provides uptake of glutamine and tryptophan. The gut is the main depot expressing over 90% of the body's entire
pool of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and B0AT1. Recent cryo-EM studies
established that ACE2 forms a thermodynamically favored dimer-of-heterodimers complex with B0AT1
assembled in the form of a dimer of two ACE2:B0AT1 heterodimers anchored in plasma membranes. Prior
epithelial cell studies demonstrated ACE2 chaperone trafficking of B0AT1. This contrasts with monomeric
expression of ACE2 in lung pneumocytes, in which B0AT1 is undetectable. The cell types in question also express
a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) known to cleave and shed the ectodomain of monomeric
ACE2 from the cell surface, thereby relinquishing protection against unchecked renin-angiotensin-system (RAS)
events of COVID-19. The present study employed molecular docking modeling to examine the interplaying
assemblage of ACE2, ADAM17 and B0AT1. We report that in the monomer form of ACE2, neck region residues
R652-N718 provide unimpeded access to ADAM17 active site pocket, but notably R708 and S709 remained
>10-15 Å distant. In contrast, interference of ADAM17 docking to ACE2 in a dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement
was directly correlated with the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2
subunit of the 2ACE2:2B0AT1] dimer of heterodimers, representing the expression pattern putatively exclusive
to intestinal, renal and cardiomyocyte cell types. The monomer and dimer-of-heterodimers docking models were
not influenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) complexed to ACE2. The results
collectively provide the underpinnings for understanding the role of B0AT1 involvement in COVID-19 and the
role of ADAM17 steering ACE2 events in intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with
implications useful for consideration in pandemic public hygiene policy and drug development.

INTRODUCTION

While lung pathophysiology is the hallmark
of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus exhibits
significant experimental and clinical gastrointestinal
(GI), renal, and cardiac muscle tropisms that invoke
specific local and systemic inflammasome
pathophysiology [1-7]. These extra-pulmonary
engagements occur capriciously in about half of
COVID-19 cases, often appearing before fever onset,
and extending after pulmonary symptoms abate [113]. The underlying mechanisms of COVID-19
involving these three cell types is largely unknown.
We approached this knowledge gap by
recognizing that the amino acid transporter B0AT1,
serving such substrates as glutamine and tryptophan,
is a common denominator uniquely expressed in the
plasma membranes of epithelial cells of intestine and
renal proximal tubule and in cardiomyocytes, but is
undetectable in lung pneumocytes [1-7, 10, 14-36].
The human GI tract is the body's site of greatest
magnitude expression of both B0AT1 and the
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor
for SARS-CoV-2, based on expression patterns from
single cell RNA seq, immunohistochemistry, and
functional genomics studies [10, 14-19, 37]. These
cell types also express a disintegrin and
metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17), a key player in the
landscape of COVID-19 pathophysiology [1, 2]. The
present study addresses the interplaying triangulation
of these three proteins.
B0AT1 was originally discovered and
functionally characterized by Stevens and coworkers
[20-27] as the Na+-coupled neutral amino acid
transport system in intestinal epithelial apical brush
border membranes (alternately called NBB, B, B0 in
the literature [21]), then subsequently Ganaphathy,
Broer, Fairweather, Verrey, and colleagues [28-34,
38] cloned its SLC6A19 gene leading to experimental
evidence of trafficking/chaperoning of B0AT1 by
ACE2 to the cell surface. Building from these studies,
Yan and coworkers in Zhou's lab [35] utilized cryoelectron microscopy to determine a 2.9 Å complex of
B0AT1 with ACE2, and established that in the
presence
of
B0AT1,
ACE2
forms
a
thermodynamically favored dimer-of-heterodimers
complex assembled as two ACE2:B0AT1
heterodimers anchored in plasma membranes.
In contrast to B0AT1-expressing cells, lung
pneumocyte membranes lack B0AT1 and express
post-translationally mature ACE2 as a stand-alone

monomer [1, 2]. Regardless of the organ—whether in
lung, cardiopulmonary, renal or gastrointestinal
tissues—the ACE2 membrane-tethered ectodomain
possesses peptidyl carboxypeptidase activity that
hydrolyzes nutritive and bioactive peptides, notably
angiotensin II (AngII), thus serving as protection
against overactivity of the pernicious arm of the
renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) [1-7, 10, 12, 14-36,
39-52]. SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the membraneattached ACE2 ectodomain as its receptor and
staging arena for priming the spike S-protein leading
to virion cell entry [1, 2].
ADAM17 is a membrane-anchored enzyme
that is central to mediating a variety of
proinflammatory and signaling events in epithelial
and endothelial cell types. ADAM17 possesses a
metzincin-like HELGHNFGAEHD active site motif
that hydrolyzes nearly 100 different substrates [53].
This serves a "sheddase" function that proteolytically
releases the ectodomains of membrane-bound
proteins into the extracellular milieu, with the
consequence that ADAM17 activity leads to
pathophysiological downsides in cardiopulmonary,
GI, and renal systems [54].
ADAM17 cleaves monomeric ACE2 [47, 49,
55], resulting in separation and release of the soluble
ACE2 (sACE2) ectodomain from the membrane
anchor stalk, thereby relinquishing its protective roles
against RAS. ADAM17 is activated by AngII, and
therefore SARS-CoV-2 induces an ADAM17triggered positive feedback viscous cycle escalating
pernicious AngII levels unabated by ACE2 which is
progressively inhibited [12]. These events of
monomeric ACE2 contribute to the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19 [1, 2].
There is no consensus in the literature
regarding the specific ACE2 residues targeted by
ADAM17 involved in release of the ectodomain.
Putative cleavage site bonds and surface residue
attraction targets have been posited to lie within a
broadly-defined region spanning residues R652-I741
within the neck region [47, 49, 55], based on
biochemical analyses of in vitro expression of
monomeric ACE2. The role of B0AT1 in influencing
the ADAM17-ACE2 relationship is unreported. To
address the many important knowledge gaps in
tissue-specific manifestations of COVID-19, the
present projected employed molecular docking
modeling to examine ADAM17's active site pocket

access to ACE2, and the role of B0AT1 influencing
the ADAM17-ACE2 relationship.
METHODS

Online protein-protein docking software
ClusPro 2.0 [56-58] was employed for docking
simulations, with ADAM17 (PDB ID:3LGP chain A)
designated as the ligand for each paired interaction.
The active site of the catalytic domain of ADAM17
is a member of the metzincins with the
HEXXHXXGXXHD motif, such that ADAM17
specifically possess a zinc atom held by H405, H409,
H415 in conjunction with glutamate at E406 serving
an acid/base catalytic function[53]; therefore these
four residues were chosen as ADAM17 docking
"attraction" residues. Targets included PDB ID:
6M17 [35] employed as a 2ACE2:2B0AT1 dimer-ofheterodimers complexed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor
binding domain (RBD), and PDB:6M18 [35]
employed analogously lacking SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
Additional targets included ACE2 monomers and
1ACE2:1B0AT1 heterodimers derived from these
structures using PyMOL[59]. Prior to docking, the
coordinate files were modified by removing small
molecules including solvent, inhibitors, ligands,
glycosylation molecules, diphosphoglycerate, and
non-standard amino acids. For each docking
simulation, non-physiologically relevant domains of
the complexes were masked out using PyMOL [59]
to prevent non-specific binding (for example,
hydrophobic residues within the transmembrane
domain of membrane anchors).
ClusPro docks protein pairs in a three-step
system [56-58]: 1) rigid body docking placed through
70,000 rotations; 2) clustering of low energy
complexes; 3) energy minimization. The docked
complexes are scored based on ClusPro 2.0 equation
of the general form,
E = w1Erep + w2Eattr + w3Eelec +w4EDARS
where Erep is energy of repulsion from van der Waals
interactions, Eattr is energy of attraction from van der
Waals interactions, Eelec is the electrostatic energy
term, and EDARS is the energy of desolvation. Docking
scoring was based on the "Balanced" option choice
with constants w1 = 0.4, w2 = -0.4, w3 = 600, and w4
= 1.0. ClusPro clusters together the top scored 1000
docked positions by finding a local center with the
most docking neighbors within a 9Å sphere [58].
Energy minimization within a given cluster is used to
remove any steric clashes between side chains, with

the top docking scores outputted along with the
corresponding complexed structure coordinate files
[57, 58]. The best model chosen from among the
output options resulting from each ClusPro docking
was based on the highest ranked most populated
cluster center (cluster size), rather than based on
individual lowest energy structures, as recommended
by Vajda and colleagues and CAPRI experiment data
[56-58]. PDBePISA [60] was used to determine the
binding contact interface residues. Figures were
generated using PyMOL[59].
RESULTS

The
fundamental
ACE2
monomer
organization [1, 2] is shown in Fig. 1A, whereby a
hydrophobic transmembrane stalk within the plasma
membrane anchors and tethers the ACE2 ectodomain
to the cell surface via a neck region. Molecular
modeling results of the present study collectively
implicated a span of ACE2 residues covering R652N718 within the neck region (Fig. 1B) that provided
the target for attempted dockings by ADAM17 as the
ligand. In the case of monomeric ACE2, Fig. 2 shows
the successful docking model, whereby ADAM17
catalytic zinc atom and its corresponding active site
pocket residues H415 and E406 were attracted <2-3
Å to ACE2 residues R652, K657 and K659, but
notably >10-15 Å distant to ACE R708 and S709.
In contrast to monomer ACE2, Fig. 3 shows
that ADAM17 active site pocket residues failed to
dock appropriately with the dimer-of-heterodimers
comprised of two ACE2 subunits complexed with
two B0AT1 subunits; the results were the same
whether the ACE2 subunits were complexed to
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (6M18, Fig. 3A,B) or excluding
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (6M17, Fig. 3C,D). In either
scenario, docking attempts resulted in ADAM17
active site pocket residues exceeding >10-15 Å to
ACE2 neck region representative residues
ACE2_R652, ACE2_K657, or ACE2_K659.
To explore the nature of the interferences
observed in Fig. 3, ADAM17 ligand dockings were
then attempted by employing targets comprised of a
single heterodimer comprised of 1ACE2:1B0AT1, as
shown in Fig. 4. Here, ADAM17 active site residues
made successful docking contacts at distances <2-3
Å with neck region residues of heterodimer
1ACE2:1B0AT1, either without SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(Fig. 4A,B) or with RBD (Fig. 4C,D) complexed to
the ACE2 subunit, with the exception that

data of Figs. 3 and 4 were then assembled to reveal

residues ACE2_R652, ACE_K657, ACE2_K659,

R708, and S709 as shown in Fig. 5. The results (Figs.
3A-D and 5A) collectively implicated ADAM17
docking interference as assigned to the presence of
the second B0AT1 complexed to the neighboring
ACE2 of the dimer-of-heterodimers assembly.

DISCUSSION

The main findings of this in silico molecular
docking modeling study are: 1) ADAM17 active site
pocket can unimpededly dock and form interface
contacts with neck region residues of monomer
ACE2, yet the ADAM17 active site remains distant
from ACE2_R708 and ACE2_S709; and 2)
interference of ADAM17 docking to ACE2 in dimerof-heterodimer arrangements was directly correlated
with the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit
that is complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of
the 2 x [ACE2:B0AT1] dimer-of-heterodimers—with
or without SARS-CoV-2 RBD—representing the
expression pattern putatively exclusive to intestinal,
renal and cardiomyocyte cell types [1-7].
Experimental evidence is lacking in the literature
concerning interactions of ADAM17 with ACE2 in
organs that exhibit SARS-CoV-2 tropism and are
comprised of these cell types that express B0AT1.
Although the 1ACE2:1B0AT1 heterodimer (note: not
the 2 x [ACE2:B0AT1] dimer-of-heterodimers) does
not have physiological antecedence in the literature,
the heterodimer molecular dockings were included in
the present project for completeness of the permuted
combinations of ACE2 with B0AT1 subunits in order
to arrive at the ADAM17 superposition results shown
in Fig. 5.
In vitro experiments [47, 49, 55] have posited
that a span covering monomer ACE2 residues R652I741 may be involved in ADAM17 binding, resulting
in the shedding of soluble ACE2 ectodomain away
from the cell surface into the extracellular milieu.
This was corroborated by the present modeling
results that implicated ACE2 candidate residues
limited to R652-N718 in its neck region (Fig. 1B).
However, the literature is conflicted regarding
specific roles of ACE2 neck residues in relation to
ADAM17 cleavage or other ADAM17 roles such as
neck region competition with alternative ACE2targeted proteases such as transmembrane serine
protease-2 (TMPRSS2). Heurich and coworkers [49]
employed a transgenic expression system yielding
biochemical experimental data implicating ACE2
residues 652-659 as essential for binding recognition
by ADAM17 or TMPRSS2. Although Heurich
experiments [49] did not ascertain the exact bonds
cleaved for shedding the ACE2 ectodomain, the
putative cleavage site was reported to be likely
somewhere within its neck span of residues 697-716,
specifically excluding R621. Jia et al [55] also

utilized biochemical experiments to contend that the
putative cleavage could occur in the span of ACE2
residues 716-741. In another set of experiments, Lai
[47] implicated cleavage between ACE2 residues
R708/S709, with R710 playing a role in presumed
binding recognition. The present docking modeling
results (Figs. 2-5) indicate that the closest ADAM17
active site residues approached ACE2 R708 was >10
Å for any of the ACE2 conformations tested, whether
ACE2 monomer, heterodimer, or dimer-ofheterodimers. Therefore, the present docking
modeling is the most consistent with, and primarily
supports, the experimental data of Heurich [49], and
refutes the premise of Lai [47] that the cleavage
occurs between ACE2 residues R708/S709.
In conclusion, these findings collectively
provide the underpinnings and gateway to future wet
lab experiments designed to understand the role of
B0AT1 involvement in COVID-19 and the role of
ADAM17 steering ACE2 events. This is especially
important relating to the capricious manifestations of
COVID-19 in intestinal and renal epithelial cells and
cardiomyocytes, with implications useful for
consideration in pandemic public hygiene policy and
drug development.
