Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus responsible of the

13

Covid-19 pandemic, were sequenced in several Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) seized

14

in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China between 2017 and 20191-3. These

15

viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from

16

Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid

17

sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of

18

the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses

19

are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate

20

infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated

21

sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3

22

are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the

23

Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in

24

five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of

25

poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the

26

Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are

27

identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like

28

viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other

29

GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from

30

three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified

31

three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of

32

polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus

33

raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were

34

infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.

35
36

For each of the five GD/P samples sequenced on Illumina platforms (Table 1), I

37

mapped the reads to the reference genome of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (GenBank

38

accession number: NC_045512)4 using Geneious Prime® 2020.0.3 and the “High sensitivity”

39

option (maximum mismatch: 40%). Then, mapped reads were used for de novo assembly. All

40

contigs were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome and assembled into a consensus sequence

41

used as reference to discover more reads in each GD/P dataset. All five GD/P genome

42

assemblies (GD/P2S, GD/P7L, GD/P8L, GD/P9L, and GD/P11L) were of poor-quality

43

having been previously sequenced at low depth (mean coverage between 0.2 and 6.5X) and

44

therefore containing high levels (between 19% and 99%) of missing data (Table 1).

45

All 2633 reads sequenced for GD/P2S2 were mapped on the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

46

indicating that all non-viral reads were removed. Curiously, within this pangolin dataset, I

47

found 11 reads identical to the human SARS-CoV-2 genome (numbered 62, 412, 514, 786,

48

787, 1417, 1440, 1498, 2222, 2231, and 2403) and four reads very similar to SARS-CoV-2

49

(only a single mutation in reads 102, 502, 1390, and 1882) whereas several homologous reads

50

(between 3 and 35) were found more divergent (between 2 and 9 mutations) but identical to

51

other GD/P sequences. Two hypotheses can be proposed to explain this result: (1) the

52

GD/P2S sample contained two different SARS-CoV-2-like viruses; or (2) the sample had

53

been contaminated by the human SARS-CoV-2 virus. To choose between these two

54

hypotheses the full raw dataset for GD/P2S is required. All Illumina reads generated for

55

GD/P2S should consequently be deposited by the authors of the study2 in NCBI without any

56

filtration process.

57

Less filtered SRA data were provided for other pangolin samples, i.e., GD/P7L,

58

GD/P8L, GD/P9L, and GD/P11L1. It was therefore possible to extract mitochondrial

59

sequences from the host (the Sunda pangolin) in order to determine the geographic origin of

60

the seized animals. As shown in Table 1, many mitochondrial reads of pangolin (≥ 7727)

61

were found for these four GD/P samples. Pairwise distances between assembled

62

mitochondrial genomes were between 0.12% - 0.41%, confirming the four samples were

63

collected on different pangolins, and suggesting they came from different localities in

64

Southeast Asia. It should be noted mitochondrial reads could not be analysed for GD/P2S

65

because the authors2 have removed all non-viral reads. It is therefore impossible to prove that

66

the pangolin (GD/P2S) analysed by Lam et al.2 differs from those studied by Liu et al.1.

67

Surprisingly, numerous mitochondrial reads from other species (nucleotide identity = 100%)

68

were also detected in the sequencing data. The GD/P7L dataset contains 1634 reads of mouse

69

(Mus musculus), representing 2% of pangolin reads. The GD/P8L dataset contains 183 mouse

70

reads (2%), and 1333 human reads (17%) (M7b haplogroup, which is found in humans from

71

China and Southeast Asia). The GD/P9L dataset includes 3447 reads of tiger, subspecies

72

Panthera tigris altaica (25%) and the GD/P11L dataset includes 1394 tiger reads (<1%). This

73

unexpected range of mammalian species that I have identified clearly warrants an

74

explanation. The most likely hypotheses are that laboratory experiments were contaminated

75

by RNA molecules from multiple organisms, or that different RNA extractions were pooled

76

into the same library.

77

When the five partial GD/P genomes were compared to each other, only three

78

nucleotide sites were found to be polymorphic: (1) position 1807: A in 21 GD/P2S reads

79

versus C in four GD/P8L reads; (2) position 5228: A in two GD/P9L reads, one GD/P7L read,

80

and one GD/P8L read versus C in three GD/P2S reads; (3) position 24979: G in 15 GD/P2S

81

reads and one GD/P8L read versus A in three GD/P7L reads. Considering the low-coverage

82

of GD/P genomes, these differences can be interpreted as sequencing errors. I suggest

83

therefore that all five pangolins were infected by the same GD/P virus strain, approximately

84

at the same time, and most probably during their captivity5. I decided therefore to assemble a

85

consensus GD/P genome by pooling together all reads sequenced from the five GD/P

86

samples. The quality of the assembled genome is still very low with a mean coverage of 13X

87

being composed of 26 fragments and containing 6.4 % missing data by comparison with the

88

human SARS-CoV-2 genome. In particular, the sequence of the gene coding for the spike

89

protein is composed of three fragments and includes 6.4 % missing data.

90

Reliable whole genome sequences of the virus detected in pangolins from Guangdong

91

are crucial to better understand the origin of Covid-19. These sequences could be used in

92

many studies, in particular to estimate mutation and recombination rates during the

93

evolutionary history of viruses related to SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, I strongly encourage

94

Chinese researchers to re-sequence the GD/P genome more deeply in order to reach a mean

95

coverage of 30X, as often recommended for genomic studies6. In this spirit, I would

96

encourage editorial boards of relevant journals to maintain their data publication standards by

97

requiring authors to fully make available their unfiltered data for the benefit of scientific

98

collaboration in tackling the current pandemic.
