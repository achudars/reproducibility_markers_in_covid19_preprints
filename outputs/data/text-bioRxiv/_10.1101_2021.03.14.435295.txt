Abstract

46

Human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to coronavirus disease

47

(COVID-19). A striking characteristic of COVID-19 infection in humans is the

48

highly variable host response and the diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from

49

clinically asymptomatic to severe immune reactions leading to hospitalization

50

and death. Here we used a 3D genomic approach to analyse blood samples at

51

the time of COVID diagnosis, from a global cohort of 80 COVID-19 patients,

52

with different degrees of clinical disease outcomes. Using 3D whole genome

53

EpiSwitch® arrays to generate over 1 million data points per patient, we

54

identified a distinct and measurable set of differences in genomic organization

55

at immune-related loci that demonstrated prognostic power at baseline to

56

stratify patients with mild forms of illness and those with severe forms that

57

required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) support. Further analysis

58

revealed both well established and new COVID-related dysregulated pathways

59

and loci, including innate and adaptive immunity; ACE2; olfactory, GCa2+

60

and nitric oxide (NO) signalling; prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the acute

61

inflammatory cytokine CCL3, and the T-cell derived chemotactic cytokine

62

CCL5. We identified potential therapeutic agents for mitigation of severe

63

disease outcome, with several already being tested independently, including

64

mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and tacrolimus) and general immunosuppressants

65

(dexamethasone and hydrocortisone). Machine learning algorithms based on

66

established EpiSwitch® methodology further identified a subset of 3D genomic

67

changes that could be used as prognostic molecular biomarker leads for the

68

development of a COVID-19 disease severity test.

Background

72

As of January 2021, an estimated 85 million people have been infected with the

73

SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide [1]. Infection with the virus has been shown to

74

induce a wide range of clinical symptoms; some individuals experience

75

asymptomatic or mild disease courses that do not require hospitalization while

76

others develop severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) triggered by a strong

77

systemic immune response that can lead to acute respiratory failure,

78

thromboembolic phenomena, microvascular disease, viral sepsis and

79

sometimes death [2]. Another early feature associated with more severe

80

disease is significant hypoxemia that commonly occurs in the absence of other

81

systemic symptoms [3]. Several clinical features for disease severity risk

82

following SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified through epidemiological

83

studies. These include advanced age, male gender, obesity, diabetes,

84

hypertension, the existence of underlying medical conditions such as

85

neurologic disability particularly stroke and renal disease, and immuno-

86

compromised status [4]. However, a subgroup of ‘healthy’ patients without

87

these risk factors nevertheless can develop significant disease leading to

88

increased morbidity and mortality. Identifying the cellular and molecular factors

89

responsible for the heterogeneous disease presentation in COVID-19 is critical

90

for understanding individual disease risk and designing appropriate therapeutic

91

interventions.

92
93

Recent studies have identified a central role for the immune system in

94

mediating disease severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals with

95

severe disease have higher levels of circulating inflammatory mediators

96

including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF),

97

granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant

98

protein-1 (MCP1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1α) after

99

SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to individuals with mild disease [5, 6]. IL6, in

100

particular, became the focus of attention as a potential disease severity

101

biomarker, as well as a candidate for therapeutic intervention, due to its central

102

role in mediating cytokine storms and the availability of existing targeted

103

therapeutic drugs against it [7, 8]. However, subsequent studies called into

104

question the prominence of IL6 and cytokine storms in SARS-Cov2 infections

105

and several clinical trials of drugs targeting IL6 showed inconsistent results and

106

no clinical benefit, especially for the moderately ill patients [9–13].. However,

107

reports on IL6 treatment with tocilizumab for a specific subgroup of critically ill

108

patients in the first two days of ICU admission demonstrated reduced risk of

109

mortality [14]. While elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are observed

110

in COVID-19, the exact mechanisms of immune dysfunction leading to severe

111

symptoms remain unclear. As individuals exposed to COVID-19 infections

112

develop a range of acute or long-term systemic inflammatory responses, the

113

ability to identify prognostic profiles for severe clinical cases where patients

114

develop hyperinflammation, do not respond to the standard of care, and

115

progress to needing ICU support is of immediate clinical utility.

116
117

The 3D configuration of the genome plays a crucial role in gene regulation [15–

118

17]. The 3D genome acts as the regulatory interface and integration point for

119

multiple inputs: genetic variants and genetic risks, epigenetic modifications,

120

metabolic signals and transcriptional events, influencing cellular phenotype and

121

ultimately clinical outcomes [15, 18, 19]. EpiSwitch® is a chromosome

122

conformation capture (3C) methodology [20, 21] that has been translated to

123

practice for the discovery of blood-based 3D genomic biomarkers and for

124

patient stratification. To date, 3D genomic biomarkers based on EpiSwitch®

125

technology have been used to successfully stratify melanoma patients,

126

prognostically stratify patients with fast and slow progressing motor neurone

127

disease, stratify patients with symptomatic and pre-symptomatic Huntington's

128

disease, diagnose patients with thyroid cancer and various stages of prostate

129

cancer, prognostically stratify patients for treatment in diffuse large B cell

130

lymphoma, and predictively stratify patients with non-small cell lung cancer for

131

response to the PD-L1 immuno-checkpoint inhibitor, avelumab [22–30].

132
133

Here we used the EpiSwitch® Explorer array platform for whole genome

134

profiling of COVID patients at the time of confirmed infection to identify 3D

135

genomic profiles, also known as chromosome conformation signatures (CCS),

136

associated with the development of severe clinical outcomes, requiring

137

ventilation and admission to intensive care units (ICU). After analysing 1.1

138

million annotated sites across the whole genome for each patient, we found

139

significant and reproducible systemic differences in the 3D genomic profiles of

140

patients presenting different levels of COVID-19 disease severity (mild and

141

severe forms of the disease). To predict disease severity in patients, a subset

142

of prognostic markers at immune-related loci displaying alternative 3D genomic

143

conformations were used to develop a molecular classifier. The markers

144

consistently present at baseline of diagnosis and associated with mild or severe

145

outcomes revealed a regulatory network of biological signalling pathways

146

dysregulated at the level of 3D genome architecture. Analysis of the protein

147

products of the immune-related genomic loci from the predictive marker panel

148

identified a set of existing therapeutic agents that may have clinical utility in

149

managing COVID-19 symptoms. The 3D genomic profile in COVID-19 patients

150

identified through the use of EpiSwitch® Explorer arrays demonstrated

151

prognostic power and could be further refined using the established EpiSwitch®

152

methodology to develop a PCR-based test for prognosis of severe outcomes in

153

COVID-19 [22–30].

Patient characteristics

157

Clinical PBMC and whole blood samples from consented patients were

158

obtained from academic collaborators and commercial sources. A total of 80

159

patients from 4 sample cohorts were used in this study, comprising a

160

multinational set of COVID-19 cases: asymptomatic, mild hospitalized and

161

severe (ICU support) - from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Peru.

162

All samples were collected at the time of diagnosis of COVID infection with PCR

163

test. Patients were then observed over the period of up to several weeks for

164

clinical manifestations of COVID disease. The age of the patients ranges from

165

24 to 95, with median at 70 years (Table 1).

Array design

171

Custom microarrays were designed using the EpiSwitch® pattern recognition

172

algorithm, which operates on Bayesian-modelling and provides a probabilistic

173

score that a region is involved in long-range chromatin interactions. It was used

174

to annotate the GRCh38 human genome assembly across ~1.1 million sites

175

with the potential to form long-range chromosome conformations [22–30]. The

176

most probable interactions were identified and filtered on probabilistic score

177

and proximity to protein, long non-coding RNA, or microRNA coding

178

sequences. Predicted interactions were limited to EpiSwitch® sites greater than

179

10 kb and less than 300 kb apart. Repeat masking and sequence analysis was

180

used to ensure unique marker sequences for each interaction. The EpiSwitch®

181

Explorer array (Agilent Technologies, Product Code X-HS-AC-02), containing

182

60-mer oligonucleotide probes was designed to interrogate potential 3D

183

genomic interactions. In total, 964,631 experimental probes and 2,500 control

184

probes were added to a 1 x 1 M CGH microarray slide design. The experimental

185

probes were placed on the design in singlicate with the controls in groups of

186

250. The control probes consisted of six different EpiSwitch® interactions that

187

are generated during the extraction processes and used for monitoring library

188

quality. A further four external inline control probe designs were added to detect

189

non-human (Arabidopsis thaliana) spike in DNA added during the sample

190

labelling protocol to provide a standard curve and control for labelling. The

191

external spike DNA consists of 400 bp ssDNA fragments from genomic regions

192

of A. thaliana. Array-based comparisons were performed described previously,

193

with the modification of only one sample being hybridised to each array slide in

194

the Cy3 channel [22–30].

Preparation of genomic templates

197

Chromatin with intact chromosome conformations from each blood sample was

198

extracted using the EpiSwitch® Explorer Array Kit following the manufacturer's

199

instructions (Oxford BioDynamics Plc) [22–30]. The EpiSwitch® Explorer arrays

200

were performed as published previously, with the modification of only one

201

sample being hybridised to each array slide in the Cy3 channel. EpiSwitch®

202

Explorer arrays, based on Agilent SureSelect array platform, allow for the highly

203

reproducible, non-biased interrogation of ~1.1 million anchor sites for 3D

204

genomic interactions (964,631 experimental probes and 2500 control probes).

205
206

Statistical analysis

207

The four COVID cohorts were normalised by background correction and

208

quantile normalisation, using the EpiSwitch® R analytic package, which is built

209

on the Limma and dplyr libraries. The four datasets were then combined into

210

one sample set containing 80 samples. Data was corrected for batch effects

211

using ComBat R script. Parametric (Limma R library, Linear Regression) and

212

non-parametric (EpiSwitch® RankProd R library) statistical methods were

213

performed to identify 3D genomic changes that demonstrated a difference in

214

abundance between the Mild and Severe COVID-19 classes. Asymptomatic

215

patients (10 samples) were excluded from this analysis. The resulting data from

216

both procedures were further filtered based on adjusted p-value (FDR

217

correction) and abundance scores (AS). Only 3D genomic markers with

218

adjusted p-value <=0.05 and AS -1.1<= or >=1.1 were selected. Both filtered

219

lists from Limma and RankProd analysis were compared and the intersection

220

of the two lists was selected for further processing.

221
222

Genome mapping and linear discriminant analysis

223

1000 3D genomic markers from the statistically filtered list with the greatest and

224

lowest abundance scores were selected for genome mapping. Mapping was

225

carried out using Bedtools closest function for the 3 closest protein coding loci

226

(Gencode v33). The resulting list of ‘Severe’ and ‘Mild’ 3D genomic markers

227

were further annotated for relatedness to immunological processes using the

228

‘immune process’ annotation from Gene Ontology and gene lists for immune

229

aging and trained immunity [31–33]. Significant 3D genomic markers with

230

associated protein coding loci involved in immune processes were then ordered

231

Results

252

Array-based profiling of COVID-19 patient cohorts

253

We used whole-genome EpiSwitch® Explorer arrays to screen peripheral blood

254

mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples collected at the time of confirmed COVID-

255

19 infection from 38 patients in three independent cohorts from the US and the

256

UK. Interestingly, all three cohorts showed separation by principal component

257

analysis (PCA) for Mild or Severe (requiring ICU admission) outcomes without

258

pre-selection or reduction of the array markers (Figure 1), suggesting that 3D

259

genomic profiles associated with different clinical outcomes existed and could

260

be distinguished.

271

Identification of the top prognostic 3D genomic markers for Severe & Mild

272

COVID-19 disease outcomes

273

To evaluate the biological relevance of the observed separation of Mild and

274

Severe COVID-19 outcomes by 3D genomic markers, we focused on the top

275

750 markers prognostically associated with each of the two outcomes. The

276

statistical testing employed in this study to determine statistically significant 3D

277

genomic markers benefits from using both parametric testing (Limma) and non-

278

parametric testing (EpiSwitch® RankProd), both procedures that correct for

279

multiple testing by using False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections. The

280

RankProd approach also has a resampling step to control for random rank

281

importance, adding another layer of statistical stringency in marker selection

282

when testing a large number of possibilities. The top markers selected were

283

filtered based on an adjusted (FDR) P value <=0.05, and high abundance

284

scores (AS), -1.1<= or >=1.1. These criteria were applied to the parametric and

285

non-parametric statistical sets, producing the top 750 intersecting markers.

286

Similar approaches and thresholds for FDR cut-offs were utilized in previously

287

published biomarker development studies using EpiSwitch® [22–30].

288

We next evaluated the top 750 3D genomic markers, identified from 964,631

289

whole genome screened cis-interactions, according to the functional roles of

290

the genes encoded across their genomic locations using Hallmark Gene Sets

291

as well as BioCarta and Reactome canonical pathway analysis (Figure 2). The

292

list of affected pathways and corresponding genetic loci with individual 3D

293

genomic changes is provided in Supplementary Tables 1a, b. When

294

evaluating the biological function of the genes within the genomic regions

295

identified as being dysregulated between patients who developed mild or

296

severe outcomes in COVID-19, a number of biological pathways with known

297

associations to COVID-19 were identified including; the olfactory signalling

298

pathway ACE2, innate and adaptive immune systems, IL6 and JAK-STAT

299

signalling, calcium signalling, (NO) nitric oxide signalling, coagulation,

300

complement, interferon gamma response, TGF beta signalling, TNF alpha

301

signalling, and apoptosis [37–42]. In addition, the MSP-RON systemic

302

inflammatory response was identified as a potentially novel signalling pathway

303

dysregulated in COVID-19.

315

Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to drive hyperactivation of CD4+

316

T-cells and immune paralysis (due to loss of FOXP3 negative feedback) to

317

promote pathogenesis of disease [43]. CD25+ (IL2 alpha receptor) FOXP3- are

318

considered hyperactive T-cells and fail to differentiate into regulatory T-cells

319

(Tregs) and produce Furin to promote viral entry into lung epithelial cells [43].

320

CD28 (see Fig.2C, Reactome, ICU) may function with IL2 to mediate the

321

feedbacks necessary to repress a potentially overstimulated immune response

322

in COVID19. With CD25 being the IL2 alpha receptor, IL-2 acts as a potent

323

growth factors for CD25-expressing activated T cells (see Fig.2A Hallmark,

324

ICU). The prevalence of both IL2 and CD25 indicates that a positive feedback

325

loop for T-cell activation is established in severe COVID-19 leading to the

326

production of multiple effector cytokines. This may be because of a reduction

327

of FOXP3-mediated negative regulation to allow functional Tregs to be

328

produced. The CD25+ T-cells in severe patients are likely to die partly by

329

cytokine deprivation or become hyperactivated in severe disease – i.e. FOXP3

330

negative cells may become ex-Tregs or hyperactivated T-cells (leading to T cell

331

paralysis). These abnormally activated T-cells produce Furin which activates

332

the Spike pro-protein cleavage and promotes viral entry into cells.

333
334

Regarding the immune checkpoints, IL2 expression activates FOXP3 and

335

prolonged activation results in the expression of immune checkpoints such as

336

CTLA-4 and FOXP3, which represses transcription of effector cytokines,

337

suppression of T-cell responses and resolution of inflammation (i.e. in normal

338

cells). In severe COVID-19, hyperactivated macrophages may present antigens

339

to CD4+ T-cells which are activated and differentiate into CD25+, IL10R+ early

340

activated T-cells which produced IL10 rather than IL2 and there is no Foxp3

341

expression to start the negative feedback. IL10 further enhances the activation

342

of CD25+ T-cells which express immune checkpoints, multiple cytokines and

343

Furin. Multifaceted Th differentiation leads to unfocused T-cell responses and

344

paralyses the T-cell system.

345
346

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-Cov-1 virus is sumoylated (see

347

Fig.2C Reactome, ICU) and binds to hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of

348

the sumoylation system [44]. SARS-CoV-2 N protein is likely to be sumoylated

349

at several sites included K62. This pathway is a potential target for treatments

350

as SUMOylation is required for homo-oligomerisation and self-association of

351

the N protein required for the formation of viral RNP and nucleocapsid

352

assembly.

353
354

PD-L1 expression in severe COVID-19 patients (see Fig.2C Reactome, ICU) is

355

likely to be linked to immunosuppressive phenotypes in innate immune cells

356

and to support lymphopenia through apoptosis of lymphocytes [45]. It is

357

possible that PD-1 signalling is not able to control hyperactivated T cells and

358

resolution of hyperinflammatory stage. It remains to be investigated if PD-L1

359

expression on lung epithelia may also regulate PD-1 expressing T-cells (as

360

shown for influenza and Rous sarcoma viruses [46, 47].

362

Oxidative phosphorylation (see Fig. 2A Hallmark, ICU) may prove to be the link

363

between the metabolic state of cells in people with predisposing conditions

364

(T1D, heart attacks, obesity, use of steroids, etc), and dysregulation of the

365

homeostasis of CD25+ T-cells and Fox3p expressing Tregs. Activation of Tregs

366

is impaired in Type1 diabetics, but is also reduced in severe COVID patients

367

[48, 49]. FOXP3 expression is reduced in CD25+ CD4+ T-cells in patients who

368

have had heart attacks [50]. Leptin released from adipocytes also prevents

369

CD25+CD4+ T-cell proliferation [51]. T-cell activation is dependent on

370

glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation while Treg differentiation is more

371

dependent on oxidative phosphorylation and inhibited by glycolysis [52, 53].

372

This could be because of the hypoxic lung in severe COVID which leads to

373

higher levels of glycolysis – hence reduced Treg differentiation – via HIF-1alpha

374

activation (which mediates glycolysis and so promotes degradation of FoxP3

375

proteins (reduced feedback loop blocking Treg differentiation). Type 1

376

interferons (see Fig.2A Hallmark, Mild) and downstream pathways are

377

suppressed in severe patients (i.e. lower levels of IFT1,2,3 and IF1TM1), with

378

lower levels of TNF ligands TRAIL, LIGHT and surface proteins SLAMF1,

379

KLRB1, all of which have roles in viral infections [43, 49].

380
381

The profound hypoxia associated with more severe disease may well result

382

from viral damage to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which is a protective

383

mechanism that diverts blood flow towards the healthier regions of the lung

384

where oxygen uptake can still occur [54]. The regulation of blood flow within the

385

lung is dependent on both Ca2+ signalling and NO. The mechanisms associated

386

with acute hypoxia signalling are not understood, but an interesting link has

387

been made in the carotid body between this mechanism and the olfactory

388

receptor Olfr78 [55]. In fact, EpiSwitch array analysis identified 3 statistically

389

significant CCS markers at the Olfr78/OR51E2 locus. A number of other

390

features relating to hypoxia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by viral

391

infection of carotid body type 1 cells [56].

392
393

Olfactory signalling (Reactome ICU) and NO (Biocarta ICU) pathways are

394

linked, as NO acts as a neurotransmitter involved in neural olfactory processes

395

in the central nervous system. and also inhibits viral replication [57, 58] With

396

the loss of smell both sustentacular cells and basal cells appear to be affected,

397

and both express ACE2 (the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus) and

398

TMPRSS2 (a serine protease controlling viral entry into cells) [59].

Linear Discriminant Analysis across COVID-19 patient cohorts

401

The unbiased whole genome array screening on three independent cohorts of

402

COVID patients, coupled with the pathway analyses on the top 750 markers,

403

strongly supported immune related genomic loci and pathways associated with

404

different clinical outcomes of COVID-19. To refine this further, we added a

405

fourth blood cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Lima, Peru which

406

at the time of collection had one of the highest COVID-19 fatality rates in the

407

world (3.5%). Of the 42 hospitalized patients in this cohort, 18 remained on the

408

ward with mild disease and 26 progressed to ICU support. Thus, when

409

combined with the 38 patients in the first 3 cohorts, a total of 80 patients who

410

were screened by the whole genome array were used, providing 77.3 million

411

data points from patients clinically assessed as Asymptomatic (7), Mild (40) and

reduced our analysis to the top 100 immuno-genetic components of the 3D

414

genomic markers (see Materials and Methods) statistically associated with

415

Severe (ICU) outcome in clinical annotations (Table 2). Next, this data was

416

subject to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). By LDA, the top 100 Severe

417

(ICU) markers were able to demonstrate statistically significant difference for

patients with different clinical outcomes - asymptomatic, mild and severe (ICU)

Interestingly, RAC1 signalling negatively regulates T cell migration via TCR

456

signalling and inhibiting RAC1 restores T cell migration suggesting that

457

essential mechanisms for T cell control are lacking in patients with Severe

When we mapped the genomic location of the top 100 3D genomic markers

Next, we used the network of genes under 3D genomic control for susceptibility

491

to severe COVID-19 outcome to evaluate the existing drugs with known gene

492

targets. We were trying to evaluate them as potential therapeutic tools for

493

mitigation of severe disease outcomes. Using GeneAnalytics we identified 25

494

drug candidates with potential utility for treating COVID-19 disease (Table 3).

515

Based on the established EpiSwitch® methodology for the discovery,

516

evaluation, feature reduction and validation of 3D genome biomarkers in the

517

format of a clinical assay [22–30], we wanted to evaluate the top 3D genomic

518

marker leads identified here for further evidence of their prognostic stratification

519

power before it could be developed into PCR-based EpiSwitch® test. The top

520

50 3D genomic markers associated with Severe (ICU) disease outcome were

521

selected to build a classifier using machine learning algorithms at the level of

522

EpiSwitch® array readouts. Markers associated with Severe (ICU) outcomes

523

were selected over those associated with Mild clinical outcomes due to the tight

clustering of the patient samples seen in the LDA analysis. Of the 80 patient

525

samples used in this study, 38 samples (UK and USA) were peripheral blood

526

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 42 (Peru) were whole blood collections. As

527

EpiSwitch® clinical assays are developed on standard whole blood input [22–

528

30], we used the 42 whole blood samples for classifier development and testing.

529

Within these samples, 24 were Severe (ICU) patients and 18 were hospitalized

530

patients with a Mild disease course. The 42 samples were randomly divided

531

into a Training set of 30 samples and Test set of 12 samples. The use of both

532

LDA and XGBoost algorithms to build classifier models was done to reduce the

533

potential of data overfitting by either model. In addition to using multiple

534

machine learning approaches to build classifying models, 10-fold cross

535

validation was utilized to ensure robust and rigorous training models were built

536

especially for XGBoost, this was carried out using the caret package in R. Both

537

models were built using the top 50 3D genomic markers associated with Severe

538

(ICU) outcomes. The LDA model built using the 30-patient Training set showed

539

good separation by clinical outcome classes in both the Training and Test sets

(Figure 5A).

Discussion

574

COVID infections lead to highly heterogeneous courses of COVID disease,

575

from asymptomatic to mild to severe at considerable risk of fatality. With all of

576

its genetic diversity and evolution, numerous mutations and genetic variants,

577

including recent UK (B1.1.7) and South African (B.1.1.354) clades, the SARS-

578

CoV-2 virus clearly shows strong variations in infectivity. However, there is little

579

evidence for the virus to being responsible for heterogeneity of the disease [62].

580

Environmental factors, and largely the host itself, appears to be the major factor

581

in defining disease severity and outcomes. As part of underlying mechanisms

582

of heterogeneity, multiple studies point at the emerging evidence of differently

583

pre-programed host innate immune cells in mild and severe disease courses,

584

with strong differences in cellular responses occurring from the very early

585

stages of infection [62].

586
587

Here, for the first time, we used an established 3D genomics approach to

588

identify molecular biomarkers, known as chromosome conformation signatures

589

(CCS), to capture the systemic differences in severe COVID-19 disease

590

outcomes at the earliest stages of infection. The 3D genome acts as an

591

integrator of multiple molecular inputs; from genetic risks, epigenetic

592

modifications, transcriptional events and metabolic signalling and serves as a

593

bridge between the stable conditional 3D genome and clinical outcomes [63,

594

64]. Preceding in the cascade of regulatory events the relevant and complex

595

changes in gene expression, alterations in 3D genome structure represent a

596

novel class of molecular readouts with the potential to forecast cellular and

597

physiological phenotypes [63]. The EpiSwitch 3D genomic arrays used here

598

have been reduced to a simple liquid biopsy testing platform with a

599

demonstrated ability to provide diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive patient

600

stratifications in a wide range of therapeutic areas [22–30], including COVID-

601

19.

602
603

We used whole 3D genome arrays to analyse molecular profiles across 1.1

604

million sites per patient from 80 COVID-infected patients from around the world.

605

In agreement with earlier observations, the regulatory 3D genome contained a

606

stable network of 3D genomic alterations tightly associated with distinct clinical

607

outcomes. The 3D genomic changes identified here provide further insight into

608

functional networks of genome regulation after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as many

609

were associated with genomic loci implicated in immune regulation. By

610

biological network analysis, we identified several immune-related pathways that

611

showed differential regulation in severe forms of COVID-19, including the

612

(MSP)-RON pathway, Gβγ signalling, and nitric oxide (NO) signalling. MSP-

613

RON signalling mediates systemic inflammatory responses and abnormalities

614

in MSP-RON signalling can lead to onset of autoimmune disease [65]. Perhaps

615

a more central mediator of the inflammatory response guiding the difference

616

between mild and severe forms of COVID-19 identified by our study is Gβγ,

617

which directly activates PI3Kγ and is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils

618

to sites of inflammation. Inhibition of PI3Kγ significantly reduces inflammation

619

and PI3Kγ is the common signalling effector for many different chemokine and

620

receptors involved in promoting inflammation [66, 67]. Last, pro-inflammatory-

621

macrophages upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and produce

622

high steady state NO concentrations. NO is also responsible for modulating

623

virtually all steps of innate and adaptive immunity [68, 69]. However, NO can

624

also cause oxidative stress, which is especially damaging to the host due to

625

increased tissue damage, a commonly seen pulmonary event seen in severe

626

COVID-19 [2, 70, 71]. The cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, the latter of which was

627

identified as a mediator of the severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19 in this

628

study, are strong inducers of NOS2 [72]. Involvement of NO pathway may also

629

explain higher risk in patients with microvascular pathologies: hypertension,

630

diabetes, smoking, stroke, chronic kidney disease and age. It would be

631

interesting to assess to what extent the respiratory failure in COVID patients is

632

associated with hypoxia due to vascular mechanisms.

633
634

Our work has clinical diagnostic implications. Several cytokines and

635

chemokines including TNF, MIP1, and IL6 have been observed to be elevated

636

using transcriptomics in patients with severe forms of COVID-19 [73, 74].

637

However, when measured at the protein level, these molecular factors aren’t

638

elevated until after the onset of severe symptoms and are therefore unlikely to

639

be causal in disease onset but may contribute to worsening of the severe

640

disease. The 3D genomic changes on the other hand, represent one of the

641

earliest steps in dynamic cellular phenotypic transitions and do not rely on

642

longitudinal sampling during infection in order to predict disease severity

643

outcome. We also identified some potentially novel therapeutic strategies for

644

managing COVID-19. Interestingly, several of the drugs identified here as

645

potential therapeutic tools have been tested independently in clinical trials for

646

COVID-19, including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and tacrolimus) and general

647

immunosuppressants (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone) [75–78]. In

648

addition, we identified a potentially novel therapeutic pathway for COVID-19

649

that did not have evidence of being explored at the time of this writing based

650

on a search of the ClinicalTrials.gov database. The signalling lipid

651

prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the cell signalling mediator calcium, the acute

652

inflammatory phase cytokine CCL3 (also known as MIP1) and the T-cell

653

derived chemotactic cytokine CCL5 (also known as RANTES) were identified

654

as potential pathways of therapeutic interest and intersect on a common

655

signalling cascade. PGE2 exerts its cellular effects though binding to one of

656

four cell membrane receptors (EP1-4) [79]. Binding to the EP1 or EP3 receptors

657

increases intracellular calcium, while binding to EP2 and EP4 receptors triggers

658

cyclic AMP mediated signalling events [79]. While PGE2 can act as a potent

659

anti-inflammatory ligand, inhibiting the production of CCL3 in dendritic cells in

660

vivo and the production of CCL5 mRNA and protein expression in LPS-

661

activated macrophages in vitro, it can also be proinflammatory in certain lung

662

conditions such as COPD, lung cancer, and several viral infections [80–82].

663

Elevated levels of PGE2 have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients

664

and increased PGE2 has been postulated to correlate with enhanced COVID-

665

19 severity in males [83, 84]. Although initial efforts at reducing PGE2 synthesis

666

in COVID-19 through the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

667

(NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen have been controversial [85] , our

668

results suggest that prostaglandin signalling in immune cells may play an

669

important role in mediating disease severity and should be evaluated as both a

670

therapeutic intervention point as well as a consideration in clinical management

671

of COVID-19 (e.g. patients with a history of NSAID use) [82].

672
673

Our findings also point to some logical next steps for advancing a clinically

674

useful test for predicting COVID-19 severity. The 3D genomic markers

675

identified by the bespoke EpiSwitch® Expoler array platform showed strong

676

predictive power for COVID-19 disease outcome. Following previously

677

published examples, these markers (or a subset of them) could be translated

678

into a MIQE-compliant [22–30] qPCR-detectable format, reduced in number by

679

machine learning on expanded patient cohorts, and used to develop a

680

molecular classifier model with a minimal signature for validation on an

681

independent testing cohort [22–30]. Interestingly, in our array study we found

682

stratification of samples using either PBMC or whole blood collections highly

683

consistent. The samples were collected at the time of COVID diagnosis, which

684

took place from very early pre-symptomatic to advanced clinical manifestation

685

stages of the disease. This suggests that the systemic 3D immune-genetic

686

profiling, captured by EpiSwitch® technology, represents consistent features of

687

regulatory state, including epigenetic status, prognostically associated with

688

severe clinical outcome and represented in whole blood and PBMC samples.

689
690

With advance of vaccination programs around the world, the latest estimates

691

from real-world broad immunization campaign in Israel demonstrate that for the

692

age group >60 (89.9% received first dose and 80% received both doses of

693

BNT162b2 BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine) hospitalization has dropped by 36% and

694

severe cases by 29% [86, 87]. The latest Emergency Use Authorization of the

695

single-shot Johnson &Johnson COVID-19 vaccine (JNJ-78436725) is based on

696

the phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial results with overall 66% effectiveness in

697

preventing moderate and severe disease, including 72% in US, 57% in Latin

698

America, and 57% effectiveness in South Africa, tested against variant B.1.351

699

[88]. Together, this strongly suggests that in the immediate future, even in the

700

context of active immunization, prognosis of COVID severity stratification would

701

remain a valuable risk-mitigation tool for a significant part of the population.

702
703

The objective of the current study was to interrogate whether the clinical

704

outcomes of severe versus mild profiles could be distinguished prognostically

705

through the use of 3D genomics as a biomarker modality. As a secondary goal,

706

we sought to use 3D genomics to better understand regulatory networks

707

involved in the development of COVID-19 illness to aid in development or

708

repurposed use of known therapeutic agents to control and mitigate severe

709

outcomes. Open access to the data obtained here and direct access to

710

EpiSwitch® Explorer array kits used in this study (Materials and Methods)

711

should provide the research community with tools to further refine COVID-19

712

disease profiles and help better understand disease risk profiling towards the

713

broader goal of promoting improved and informed clinical decision making.

714
715

Conclusions

716

While the collective understanding of the biology behind SARS-CoV-2 infection

717

leading to development of COVID-19 has been a focus of recent research

718

efforts, the molecular factors that underly differences in COVID-19 disease

719

presentation/severity are largely unknown and largely dictated by the host.

720

There is a high need for high content technologies that could be reduced to

721

practice for assessment of cellular, systemic host profiles to identify potential

722

biomarkers and underlying molecular network mechanisms addressing

723

outcome prediction. Taking an array-based EpiSwitch® approach, we identified

724

blood-based differences in 3D immuno-genetic molecular profiles of patients

725

with mild forms of COVID-19 compared to those with more severe clinical

726

outcomes. Our results suggest that 3D immuno-genetic profiles in multi-cohort

727

study could be used as a biomarker modality for COVID specific disease

728

classification and outcome prediction.

730

In line with established EpiSwitch® methodology [22–30], further feature

731

reduction in PCR format for the initial findings and biomarker leads described

732

here, use of an extended patient cohort and an independent cohort validation

733

will serve to further validate the biological relevance of the 3D genomic changes

734

and could help to establish the minimal set of prognostic markers that could

735

robustly stratify patients. Ultimately, as a next step, a reduced set of markers in

736

EpiSwitch® MIQE-compliant qPCR format could be developed and used as a

737

clinical prognostic assay to help patients understand their likely risk of

738

developing severe disease outcomes if infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

739

Such a test could assist in informed clinical decisions on patient care in cases

740

of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. It could also act as a prognostic

741

measure, providing risk evaluation through systemic profiling prior to exposure

742

to SARS-CoV-2 and assist in informed decisions on personal lifestyle, social,

743

and workforce activities.
