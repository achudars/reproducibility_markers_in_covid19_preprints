Abstract
Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2/COVID19 pandemic. We identified
panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from eight large phage-displayed Fab,
scFv and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein. One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized replication
competent SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. There
was no enhancement of pseudovirus infection in cells expressing Fcγ receptors at any
concentration. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to
RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 potently neutralized
mouse ACE2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild type BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2
expressing transgenic mice. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations
indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2
infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus
has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification
(within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public
health threats from emerging microbes.

The severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1) has spread worldwide
thus requiring safe and effective prevention and therapy. Inactivated serum from convalescent
patients inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and decreased symptom severity of newly infected
patients (2, 3) suggesting that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be even more effective.
Human mAbs are typically highly target-specific and relatively non-toxic. By using phage display
we have previously identified a number of potent fully human mAbs (m396, m336, m102.4)
against emerging viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (4) ,
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (5) and henipaviruses (6, 7), respectively,
which are also highly effective in animal models of infection (8-11); one of them was administered on
a compassionate basis to humans exposed to henipaviruses and successfully evaluated in a
clinical trial (12).
Size and diversity of phage-displayed libraries are critical for rapid selection of high
affinity antibodies without the need for additional affinity maturation. Our exceptionally potent
antibody against the MERS-CoV, m336, was directly selected from very large (size ~1011
clones) library from 50 individuals (5). However, another potent antibody, m102.4, against
henipavirusses was additionally affinity matured from its predecessor selected from smaller
library (size ~1010 clones) from 10 individuals (7, 13). Thus, to generate high affinity and safe
mAbs we used eight very large (size ~ 1011 clones each) naive human antibody libraries in Fab,
scFv or VH format using PBMCs from 490 individuals total obtained before the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak. Four of the libraries were based on single human VH domains where CDRs (except
CDR1 which was mutagenized or grafted) from our other libraries were grafted as previously
described (14).

Another important factor to consider when selecting effective mAbs is the appropriate
antigen. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein (S) to enter into host
cells. The S receptor binding domain (RBD) binds to its receptor, the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2), thus initiating series of events leading to virus entry into cells
(15, 16). We have previously characterized the function of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and
identified its RBD which is stable in isolation (17). The RBD was then used as an antigen to pan
phage displayed antibody libraries; we identified potent antibodies (5, 8) more rapidly and the
antibodies were more potent than when we used whole S protein or S2 (unpublished). In
addition, the SARS-CoV RBD based immunogens are highly immunogenic and elicit
neutralizing antibodies which protect against SARS-CoV infections (18). Thus, to identify
SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, we generated two variants of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (aa 330-532) (Fig.
S1) and used them as antigens for panning of our eight libraries.
Panels of high-affinity binders to RBD in Fab, scFv and VH domain formats were
identified. There was no preferential use of any antibody VH gene (an example for a panel of
binders selected from the scFv library is shown in Fig. S2A) and the number of somatic
mutations was relatively low (Fig. S2B, for the same panel of binders as in Fig. S2A). For nine
of the highest affinity mAbs a provisional patent application was filed on March 12, 2020 by the
University of Pittsburgh. Those high affinity mAbs can be divided into two groups in terms of
their competition with hACE2. Two representatives of each group are Fab ab1 and VH ab5. To
further increase their binding through avidity effects and extend their half-live in vivo they were
converted to IgG1 and VH-Fc fusion formats, respectively. Ab1 was characterized in more
details because of its potential for prophylaxis and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The Fab and IgG1 ab1 bound strongly to the RBD (Fig. 1A) and the whole SARS-CoV-2
S1 protein (Fig. 1B) as measured by ELISA. The Fab ab1 equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd,
as measured by the biolayer interferometry technology (BLItz), was 1.5 nM (Fig. 1C). The IgG1
ab1 bound with high (Kd =160 pM) avidity to recombinant RBD (Fig. 1D). IgG1 ab1 bound cell
surface associated native S glycoprotein suggesting that the conformation of its epitope on the
RBD in isolation is close to that in the native S protein (Fig. 2, S3). The binding of IgG1 ab1 was
of higher avidity than that of hACE2-Fc (Fig. 2B). Binding of ab1 was specific for the SARSCoV-2 RBD; it did not bind to the SARS-CoV S1 (Fig. 3A) nor to cells that do not express
SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (Fig. 2A). Ab1 competed with hACE2 for binding to the RBD (Fig.
3B and C) indicating possible neutralization of the virus by preventing binding to its receptor. It
did not compete with the CR3022 (Fig. 3D and E), which also binds to SARS-CoV (19) and with
ab5 (Fig. 3F).
IgG1 ab1 potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with an IC50 of 10 ng/ml (Fig
4A). It did not enhance pseudovirus infection of FcγRIA overexpressing 293T-hACE2 cells at
any concentration (Fig 4B). It also did not mediate pseudovirus infection of FcγRII expressing
K562 cells (Fig S4B). Importantly, IgG1 ab1 exhibited potent neutralizing activity against
authentic SARS-CoV-2 in two independent assays - a microneutralization-based assay (100%
neutralization at < 400 ng/ml) (Fig. 4C) and a luciferase reporter gene assay (IC50 = 200 ng/ml)
(Fig. 4D). In agreement with the specificity of binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and not to the
SARS-CoV S1 the IgG1 ab1 did not neutralize live SARS-CoV (Fig. 4C). The IgG1 m336 (5)
control which is a potent neutralizer of MERS-CoV, did not exhibit any neutralizing activity
against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4C). The VH ab5 and VH-Fc ab5 bound the RBD with high affinity
and avidity (Fig. S5A.B) but did not compete with hACE2 (Fig. S5C) or neutralize SARS-CoV-2

(Fig. 4D), indicating that not all antibodies targeting epitopes on the RBD affect virus
replication.
To evaluate the efficacy of IgG1 ab1 in vivo we used two animal models. The first one is based
on the recently developed mouse ACE2 adapted SARS-CoV-2 which has two mutations
Q498T/P499Y at the ACE2 binding interface on RBD (20). IgG1 ab1 protected mice from high
titer intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge (105 pfu) of BALB/c mice in a dose dependent manner
(Fig 5A). There was complete neutralization of infectious virus at the highest dose of 0.9 mg,
and statistically significant reduction by 100-fold at 0.2 mg; there was a trend for reduction at
0.05 mg dose but did not reach statistical significance. The IgG1 m336 which potently
neutralizes the MERS-CoV in vivo was used as an isotype control because it did not have any
activity in vitro. These results also suggest that the RBD double mutations Q498T/P499Y do not
affect IgG1 ab1 binding. The second model we used is the transgenic mice expressing human
ACE2 (hACE2) (21). Mice were administered 300 ug of IgG1 ab1 prior to wild type SARSCoV-2 challenge followed by detection of infectious virus in lung tissue 2 days later. Replication
competent virus was not detected in four of the five mice which were treated with IgG1 ab1 (Fig
5B). All six control mice and one of the treated mice had more than 10 3 PFU per lung. These
results show clear evidence of a potent preventive effect of IgG1 ab1 in vivo. The reason for
absence of virus neutralization in one of the mice is unclear but may be due to individual
variation in antibody transfer from the peritoneal cavity where it was administered to the upper
and lower respiratory tract. Our previous experiments with transgenic mice expressing human
DPP4 and treated with two different doses of m336 (0.1 and 1 mg per mouse) showed similar
lack of protection of one (out of four) mice at the lower dose but at the higher dose all four mice
were protected (9) similarly to the results obtained with the mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2. The in

vivo protection also indicates that IgG1 ab1 can achieve neutralizing concentrations in the
respiratory tract. This is the first report of in vivo activity of a human monoclonal antibody
against SARS-CoV-2 by using two different mouse models. The results also show some
similarity between the two models in terms of evaluation of antibody efficacy. In both models
about the same dose of antibody (0.2-0.3 mg) reduced about 100-fold the infectious virus in the
lungs. This result now suggests that testing of antibody efficacy could be performed at a larger
scale than testing with the hACE2 transgenic mice due to the availability of wild type mice. It
also shows robust neutralizing activity of IgG1 ab1 in two different models of infection.
Interestingly, Fab ab1 had only several somatic mutations compared to the closest germline
predecessor genes. This implies that ab1-like antibodies could be elicited relatively quickly by
using RBD-based immunogens especially in some individuals with naïve mature B cells
expressing the germline predecessors of ab1. This is in contrast to the highly mutated broadly
neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies that require long maturation times, are difficult to elicit and their
germline predecessors cannot bind native HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (22, 23). The RBD of
the MERS-CoV S protein was previously shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies (24, 25). For
SARS-CoV-2 only a few somatic mutations would be sufficient to generate potent neutralizing
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD which is a major difference from the elicitation of
broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 which requires complex maturation pathways (22,
26-29). The germline-like nature of the newly identified mAb ab1 also suggests that it has
excellent developability properties that could accelerate its development for prophylaxis and
therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection (30).
To further assess the developability (drugability) of ab1 its sequence was analyzed online
(opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/TAP.php); no obvious liabilities were found. In

addition, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography to evaluate
its propensity for aggregation. IgG1 ab1 at a concentration of 2 mg/ml did not aggregate for six
days incubation at 37°C as measured by DLS (Fig. 6A); there were no high molecular weight
species in freshly prepared IgG1 ab1 also as measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
(Fig. 6B). IgG1 ab1 also did not bind to the human cell line 293T (Fig. 2A) even at very high
concentration (1 μM) which is about 660-fold higher than its Kd indicating absence of nonspecific binding to many membrane-associated human proteins. The IgG1 ab1 also did not bind
to 5,300 human membrane-associated proteins as measured by a membrane proteome array (Fig.
6C).
The high affinity/avidity and specificity of IgG1 ab1 along with potent neutralization of
virus and good developability properties suggests its potential use for prophylaxis and therapy of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because it strongly competes with hACE2 indicating a certain degree of
mimicry, one can speculate that mutations in the RBD may also lead to inefficient entry into
cells and infection. In the unlikely case of mutations that decrease the ab1 binding to RBD but do
not affect binding to ACE2 it can be used in combination with other mAbs including those we
identified or in bi(multi)specific formats to prevent infection of such SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Ab1
could also be used to select appropriate epitopes for vaccine immunogens and for diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of neutralizing mAbs within days of target
availability shows the potential value of large antibody libraries for rapid response to emerging
viruses.

Materials and Methods
Generation, Expression and Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc, S1-Fc, ACE2-Fc
and CR3022 Fab. The SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein and the anti-SARS-CoV antibody
IgG1 CR3022 (31) and IgG1 S230 genes were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, Iowa). MERSCoV-specific IgG1 m336 antibody was expressed in human mammalian cell as described
previously (5). The ACE2 gene was ordered from OriGene (Rockville, MD). The RBD domain
(residues 330-532) and S1 domain (residues 14-675) and ACE2 (residues 18-740) genes were

Woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to generate the RBD-Fc, S1-Fc and
ACE2-Fc expression plasmids. The RBD-avi-his protein with an avi tag followed by a 6×His tag
at C-terminal was subcloned similarly. These proteins were expressed with Expi293 expression

system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified with protein A resin (GenScript) and by Ni-NTA
resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Fab CR3022 antibody gene with a His tag was cloned into
pCAT2 plasmid (developed in house) for expression in HB2151 bacteria and purified with NiNTA resin. Protein purity was estimated as >95% by SDS-PAGE and protein concentration was
measured spectrophotometrically (NanoVue, GE Healthcare).
Selection, Expression, and Purification of the RBD-specific Fabs and VHs and Conversion
to IgG1s or Fc Fusion Proteins. The naïve human antibody phage display libraries were made
based on the antibody cDNA from 490 healthy donors peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) and
splenocytes. The Fab and scFv libraries were constructed by randomly pairing antibody VH and
VL gene, and the VH libraries - by grafting CDRs into stable VH scaffolds. These libraries
contain very large transformants (size for each ~1011) and are highly diverse (unpublished). For
panning, the libraries were preabsorbed on streptavidin-M280-Dynabeads in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature (RT) and incubated with 50 nM biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD for 2 h at room
temperature with gentle agitation. Phage particles binding to biotinylated antigen were separated
from the phage library using streptavidin-M280-Dynabeads and a magnetic separator (Dynal).
After washing for 20 times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and another 20 times
with 1 ml of PBS, bound phage particles were eluted from the beads using 100 mM
triethanolamine followed by neutralization with 1 M, pH 7.5 Tris-HCl. For the 2nd round of
panning, 10 nM (2 nM for the 3rd round) of biotinylated antigen was used as antigen. After the
3rd round of panning against 2 nM biotinylated antigen, 96 individual clones were screened for
binding to RBD-Fc fusion protein by phage ELISA. Panels of Fabs and VHs were selected and
sequenced. For conversion to Fc-fusion, the VH gene was subcloned into pSecTag B vector
(already containing human Fc fragment). For conversion to IgG1, Fab VH and VL gene was

inserted into pDR12 vector which contains the IgG1 CH1-CH3 and CL domains. Both VH-Fc
and IgG1 were expressed as previously described(32). Protein purity was estimated as >95% by
SDS-PAGE and protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (NanoVue, GE
Healthcare).
ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 330-532) protein was coated on a 96-well plate
(Costar) at 100 ng/well in PBS overnight at 4oC. For phage ELISA, phage from each round of
panning (polyclonal phage ELISA) or clones randomly picked from the infected TG1 cells
(monoclonal phage ELISA) were incubated with immobilized antigen. Bound phage were
detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-M13-HRP polyclonal Ab
(Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). For the soluble Fab/VH binding assay, HRP-conjugated mouse
anti-FLAG tag Ab (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to detect Fab/VH binding. For the IgG1 or VH-Fc
binding assay, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for detection.
For the competition ELISA with hACE2, 2 nM of human ACE2-mouse Fc was incubated with
serially diluted Fab, VH, IgG, or VH-Fc, and the mixtures were added to RBD coated wells.
After washing, bound ACE2-mouse Fc was detected by HRP-conjugated anti mouse IgG (Fc
specific) (Sigma-Aldrich). Another way to do hACE2 competition ELISA is to incubate the fixed
concentration of biotinylated hACE2-Fc with gradient concentrations of antibody. After washing,
the bound hACE2 was detected by HRP conjugated streptavidin. For the competition ELISA
with CR3022, 10 nM IgG1 CR3022 was incubated with serially diluted Fab ab1 or VH ab5, and
the mixtures were added to RBD-his coated wells. After washing, bound IgG1 CR3022 was
detected by HRP-conjugated anti human Fc antibody. For the competition ELISA between ab1
and ab5, 6 nM biotinylated IgG1 ab1 was incubated with RBD-Fc in the presence of different
concentrations of VH ab5 or VH-Fc ab5. After washing, detection was made by using HRP

conjugated streptavidin. All the colors were developed by 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB,
Sigma) and stopped by 1 M H2SO4 followed by recording absorbance at 450 nm. Experiments
were performed in duplicate and the error bars denote ± SD, n =2.
BLItz. Antibody affinities and avidities were analyzed by the biolayer interferometry BLItz
(ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA). For affinity measurements, protein A biosensors (ForteBio: 18–
5010) were coated with RBD-Fc for 2 min and incubated in DPBS (pH = 7.4) to establish
baselines. 125 nM, 250 nM and 500 nM VH and Fab were used for association. For avidity
measurements, RBD-Fc was biotinylated with EZ‐link sulfo‐NHS‐LC‐biotin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) (RBD-Fc-Bio). Streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio: 18–5019) were
coated with RBD-Fc-Bio for 2 min and incubated in DPBS (pH = 7.4) to establish baselines. 50
nM, 100 nM and 200 nM IgG1 ab1 and VH-Fc ab5 were chosen for association. The association
was monitored for 2 min and then the antibody allowed to dissociate in DPBS for 4 min. The ka
and kd were derived from the sensorgrams fitting and used for Kd calculation. For the competitive
Blitz, 500 nM IgG1 ab1 was loaded onto the RBD-Fc coated sensor for 300 s to reach saturation
followed by dipping the sensor into the 0.1 μM hACE2-Fc or Fab CR3022 solution in the
presence of 500 nM IgG1 ab1. The association was monitored for 300 s. Meanwhile, the signals
of 0.1 μM hACE2 or CR3022 binding to the RBD-Fc coated sensor in the absence of IgG1 ab1
was independently recorded. Competition was determined by the percentage of signals in the
presence of ab1 to signals in the absence of ab1 (< 0.7 is considered to be competitive) (33).
Flow Cytometry Analysis. Full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with native signal peptide
replaced by the CD5 signal peptide were codon-optimized and synthesized by IDT. S gene was
subcloned into our in-house mammalian cell expression plasmid, which were used to transiently
transfect 293T cells cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS,

1% P/S. The transient expression level is tested by FACS staining using the recombinant
hACE2-Fc, IgG1 CR3022 and IgG1 ab1. For the determination of binding avidity of IgG1 ab1
and hACE2-Fc to the cell surface S, quantitative FACS was performed by using the 48 h post
transfection cells based on standard procedures. Briefly, 5 folds serially diluted antibodies or
hACE2-Fc with highest concentration of 1 μM were added into 1×106 cells and incubate at 4 °C
for 30 min followed by 3 times washing using PBS + 0.5% BSA buffer (PBSA buffer). Then
cells were resuspended to 100 µl PBSA buffer followed by addition of 1 µl PE conjugated antihuman Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells then was washed by
PBSA for 3 times and then analyzed by flow cytometry using BD LSR II (San Jose, CA). The
gating of PE-A+ population was performed by FlowJo_V10_CL. The concentrations at which
IgG1 ab1 or hACE2-Fc achieved 50% PE-A+ cells (EC50) was obtained by fitting using the
equation of “[agonist] vs. response -- variable slope (four parameter)” in the Graphpad Prism 7
(San Diego, CA).
Pseudovirus and Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of Infection Assays. The ADE
assay was based on the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into hACE2 expressing cells assay
according to previous protocols (34). Briefly, HIV-1 backbone based pseudovirus was packaged
in 293T cells by co-transfecting with plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein and plasmid
encoding luciferase expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) using polyethylenimine (PEI).
Pseudovirus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h later and concentrated using Lenti-X™
concentrator kit (Takara, CA). Pseudovirus neutralization assay was then performed by
incubation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with 5 folds serially diluted antibody with starting
concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by addition of the mixture into pre-seeded
hACE2 expressing cells in duplicate. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 hour at

room temperature. The medium was replaced 4 hrs later. After 24 h, luciferase expression was
determined by Bright-Glo kits (Promega, Madison, WI) using BioTek synergy multi-mode
reader (Winooski, VT). The 50% pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titer (IC50) was calculated by
non-linear fitting the plots of luciferase signals against antibody concentrations in the Graphpad
Prism 7. Experiments were performed in duplicate and the error bars denote ± SD, n =2. ADE
was determined by comparing luciferase signals of antibody treated groups to those of virus only
group. FcγRs expression level was FACS tested by using FITC conjugated anti-FcγR antibody
(Invitrogen).
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization Assay. The standard live virus-based
microneutralization (MN) assay was used as previously described (9, 35-37). Briefly, serially
three-fold and duplicate dilutions of individual monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were prepared in
96-well microtiter plates with a final volume of 60 μl per well before adding 120 infectious units
of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in 60 μl to individual wells. The plates were mixed well and
cultured at room temperature for 2 h before transferring 100 μl of the antibody-virus mixtures
into designated wells of confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates. Vero E6
cells cultured with medium with or without virus were included as positive and negative
controls, respectively. Additionally, Vero E6 cells treated with the MERS-CoV RBD-specific
neutralizing m336 mAb (5) were included as additional controls. After incubation at 37oC for 4
days, individual wells were observed under the microcopy for the status of virus-induced
formation of cytopathic effect. The efficacy of individual mAbs was expressed as the lowest
concentration capable of completely preventing virus-induced cytopathic effect in 100% of the
wells.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Reporter Gene Neutralization Assay. Full-length viruses
expressing luciferase were designed and recovered via reverse genetics and described previously
(38, 39). Viruses were tittered in Vero E6 USAMRID cells to obtain a relative light units (RLU)
signal of at least 20× the cell only control background. Vero E6 USAMRID cells were plated at
20,000 cells per well the day prior in clear bottom black walled 96-well plates (Corning 3904).
MAb samples were tested at a starting dilution 100 g/ml, and were serially diluted 4-fold up to
eight dilution spots. SARS-CoV-UrbaninLuc, and SARS-CoV-2-SeattlenLuc viruses were
diluted in separate biological safety cabinets (BSC) in accordance with UNC safety rules and
were mixed with serially diluted antibodies. Antibody-virus complexes were incubated at 37C
with 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Following incubation, growth media was removed and virus-antibody
dilution complexes were added to the cells in duplicate. Virus-only controls and cell-only
controls were included in each neutralization assay plate. Following infection, plates were
incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 for 48 hours. After the 48 hours incubation, cells were lysed and
luciferase activity was measured via Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to
the manufacturer specifications. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization IC50 were defined
as the sample concentration at which a 50% reduction in RLU was observed relative to the
average of the virus control wells. Experiments were performed in duplicate and IC50 was
obtained by the fitting of neutralization curves with the “sigmoidal dose-response (variable
slope)” equation in Graphpad Prism 7.
Inhibition of mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild type mice. A recombinant mouse ACE2
adapted SARS-CoV-2 variant was constructed by introduction of two amino acid changes
(Q498T/P499Y) at the ACE2 binding pocket in RBD (20). Virus stocks were grown on Vero E6
cells and viral titer was determined by plaque assay. Groups of 5 each of 10 to 12-month old

female BALB/c mice (Envigo, #047) were treated prophylactically (12 hours before infection)
intraperitoneally with 900 µg, 200 µg, or 50 µg of IgG1 ab1, respectively. Mice were challenged
intranasally with 105 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Two days post infection, mice were
sacrificed, and lung viral titer was determined by plaque assay.
Evaluation of IgG1 ab1 Protective Efficacy in a hACE2 Mouse Model of Infection. Human
ACE2 transgenic 6-9 week old C3B6 mice were treated intraperitoneally with 0.3 mg of
antibody (5 mice) or negative controls (6 mice) 15 hours prior to intranasal infection with 105
PFU of SARS-CoV-2. No weight loss was observed over the course of the two-day infection.
Lung tissue was homogenized in PBS and virus replication assessed by plaque assay on VeroE6
cells. The assay limit of detection was 100 PFU.
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). For evaluation of aggregation propensity, IgG1-ab1 were
buffer-changed to DPBS and ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter. The concentration was adjusted to
2 mg/mL; ~500 μL samples were incubated at 37 °C. On day 0, day 1 and day 6, samples were
taken out for DLS measurement on Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN3600 (Malvern Instruments Limited,
Westborough, MA) to determine the size distributions of protein particles.

Membrane Proteome Array Specificity Testing Assay. Integral Molecular, Inc. (Philadelphia,
PA) performed specificity testing of IgG1 ab1 using the Membrane Proteome Array (MPA)
platform. The MPA comprises 5,300 different human membrane protein clones, each
overexpressed in live cells from expression plasmids that are individually transfected in separate
wells of a 384-well plate (42). The entire library of plasmids is arrayed in duplicate in a matrix
format and transfected into HEK-293T cells, followed by incubation for 36 h to allow protein
expression. Before specificity testing, optimal antibody concentrations for screening were
determined by using cells expressing positive (membrane-tethered Protein A) and negative
(mock-transfected) binding controls, followed by flow cytometric detection with an Alexa Fluorconjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Based on the assay
setup results, ab1 (20 μg/ml) was added to the MPA. Binding across the protein library was
measured on an iQue3 (Ann Arbor, MI) using the same fluorescently labeled secondary
antibody. To ensure data validity, each array plate contained positive (Fc-binding; SARS-CoV-2
S protein) and negative (empty vector) controls. Identified targets were confirmed in a second
flow cytometric experiment by using serial dilutions of the test antibody. The identity of each
target was also confirmed by sequencing.
Ethics statement. Human ACE2 transgenic C3B6 mice (6–9 weeks old) and BALB/c mice (1012 weeks old) were used for all experiments. The study was carried out in accordance with the
recommendations for care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare

IgG1 ab1 was pre-mixed with live virus before adding to the VeroE6 cells. After incubation for 4
days at 37oC, virus-induced cytopathic effects were observed under the microcopy. The
neutralization capacity was expressed as the lowest concentration capable of completely
preventing virus induced cytopathic effect in 100% of the wells. The neutralization of SARSCoV live virus by IgG1 ab1 was also evaluated. The MERS-CoV antibody m336 was used as a
negative control. (D) Neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 by a reporter gene assay. Full-length
viruses expressing luciferase were designed and recovered via reverse genetics. IgG1 ab1 was
incubated with SARS-UrbaninLuc, and SARS2-SeattlenLuc viruses and then mixed with Vero

activity was measured via Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Neutralization IC50
were defined as the sample concentration at which a 50% reduction in RLU was observed
relative to the average of the virus control wells.

statistical significance of difference between IgG1 treated and control mice lung infectious virus
was analyzed by the one-tailed Mann Whitney U test calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.0. A
p value < 0.05 was considered significant. In the mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 model, the 0.05
mg treatment group did not show significant differences compared to the isotype controls
although minor virus titer decrease was observed. The 0.2 mg and 0.9 mg treatment showed
significant decrease compared to the isotype controls (p=0.017 and 0.00014, respectively). In the
hACE tg mouce model, the p value for our comparison was 0.011 and the U value was 2,
demonstrating significant difference between IgG1 ab1 treated and control groups.

measured by a membrane proteome array. Specificity testing of IgG1 ab1 (20 μg/ml) was
performed using the Membrane Proteome Array (MPA) platform which comprises 5,300
different human membrane proteins, each overexpressed in live cells. To ensure data validity,
each array plate contained positive (Fc-binding, FCGR1A; IgG1 ab1 binding, SARS-CoV-2) and
negative (empty vector) controls. Identified targets were confirmed in a second flow cytometric
experiment by using serial dilutions of the test antibody. The identity of each target was also
confirmed by sequencing.
