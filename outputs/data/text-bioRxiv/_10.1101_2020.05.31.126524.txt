Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an
ongoing unprecedented global public health crises of coronavirus disease in 2019
(CoVID-19). The precipitously increased death rates, its impact on livelihood and
trembling economies warrant the urgent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which
would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we
propose a de novo synthesised avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical
respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of Newcastle disease
virus, proto-type virus of AOaV-1, was engineered to express full length spike (S)
glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the SARSCoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate
demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of
AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were
observed in cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively
replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly,
incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles
attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to antiAOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine
vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated
eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics
of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is
highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human,
and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for
clinical studies.

Introduction
An outbreak of pneumonia was erupted in Chinese seafood market in Wuhan during
late 2019 and within a month of its origin, on 30 January 2020, a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern was declared by the World Health Organization
(WHO) due to its high human-to-human transmission. Within next month, the outbreak
of coronavirus disease in 2019 (CoVID-19) soared among communities
unprecedentedly and spread across the globe and a pandemic was declared on 11
March 2020 by WHO. A large proportion (~80%) of CoVID-19 infected patients
showed only moderate symptoms which led to staggering rate increase in global
spread of the infection. The acute respiratory distress syndrome, manifested in ~20%
of CoVID-19 patients, caused substantial case fatality rates especially in elderly and
frail people with co-morbidities1.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
agent of ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic, belongs to the family Coronavirdae within the
Betacoronavirus (b-CoV) genus. Similar to SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 carries a single stranded
linear RNA genome with positive polarity2. The genome is consisted of 4 structural
proteins including envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), 16
non-structural proteins (nsp 1-16) and multiple accessary proteins. Amongst these
viral proteins, the S protein constitute a major protective antigen that elicit highly
specific antibodies mediated immune responses2. Therefore, the S protein remained
the primary vaccine markers against coronaviruses.
Currently, there is no registered drugs or vaccines available to curb the pandemic;
however, multiple vaccines using a range of technologies are being developed, or preclinically or clinically being investigated3. Amongst these, an inactivated vaccine has
elicited strong antibodies which can neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains and can
partially or fully protect macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge4. A chimpanzee
adeno (ChAd)-vectored vaccine, expressing the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2,
elicited humoral and cell-mediated responses in rhesus macaques5. However, it failed
to fully alleviated clinical signs in vaccinated macaques albeit reduced severity and
protection against pneumonia. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 also failed to reduce the viral
replication in the nose, highlighting the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 through
sneezing even in vaccinated people5.
Owing to multifaceted advantages, the avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1) proposes a
potential vaccine vector against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, AOaV-1 (represented by
a type species, Newcastle disease virus, NDV) are exclusively cytoplasmic viruses
and therefore the viral gene segments are not integrated into the host genome which
raises their safety profile. Since these vectors lack natural recombination, the
expression of transgenes is genetically stable. Additionally, AOaV-1 can infect multiple
species of animals, the vaccines can be produced in chicken embryonated eggs and
multiple cell lines6. Given these and other features, apathogenic strains of AOaV-1
have been used as live attenuated vaccines against multiple viruses including
influenza, SARS, human immunodeficiency virus7,8 , human parainfluenza, rabies9,
Nipah disease10, Rift Valley fever11, Ebola and highly pathogenic H5N112,13.
Importantly, AOaV-1 has appeared to be safe and effective in mice 10,13, dogs9, pigs10,

cattle14,15, sheep14, African green and rhesus monkeys16,17 and humans 18- 21. Notably,
the natural host of AOaV-1 are birds and the vector is antigenically distinct from
common human pathogens. Therefore, no pre-existing immunity in human make it an
ideal vector to deliver transgene effective and safely.
In the present study, we de novo designed an AOaV-1 vector and generated a
recombinant vaccine candidate by expressing full-length codon optimized S protein of
the SARS-CoV-2 at a pre-optimized gene junction. This topical respiratory vaccine
candidate was fully characterized in vitro. Based on the infection and spreadability
within cells, its sensitivity to anti-AOaV-1 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies, its replication kinetics and stability in chicken embryonated eggs, the
rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 is a scalable topical vectored vaccine candidate against
SARS-CoV-2 to be tested for safety and immunogenicity in animal studies.

Results
Design and Construction of AOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidate. An
avirulent strain of AOaV-1 was used to construct vaccine candidate against SARSCoV-2. The full length antigenomic sequence of AOaV-1, originally isolated from
asymptomatic wild birds, was de novo synthesised. To facilitate minigenome
transcription, an autocatalytic and “rule-of-six” adhered hammerhead ribozyme
sequences was introduced in both 5’ and 3’-ends of the antigenome (Fig. 1A).
An expression cassette containing the Kozak sequence, GE, GS, IG and the ORF for
the full-length S gene was codon-optimized for homo sapiens codon usage and
inserted into the unique PmeI site between P and M genes, which was originally
preserved during the cloning of complete antigenome (Fig. 1A). The construct was
named rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 whereas the AOaV-1 without the insertion of the
foreign gene (AoaV-1-wt) was used as infection control throughout the study. The
orientation of the inserted S gene was confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis.
Rescue of Recombinant Vaccine and Evaluation of the Spike Gene Expression
of SARS-CoV-2. The rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV-1-wt were rescued in Vero
cells and propagated in 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Screening of multiple
individually inoculated eggs, using real-time PCR and hemagglutination assays, has
identified successfully rescued rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Fig. 1
Supplementary) which were used to fully characterize in the presented study.
Expression of the S protein was confirmed by indirect confocal immunofluorescent
staining of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Counter-staining of the HN
protein of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed co-expression of the
surface protein in rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, whereas only HN protein
expression was observed in AOaV-1-wt-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Graphical profile of
the expression intensities confirmed co-expression of both surface proteins (Fig. 1C)
where a vast majority of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2-infected cells expressed both HN and
S proteins simultaneously (Fig. 1D).
Both recombinant and wild type AOaV-1 isolates replicated at high titre in eggs (≥28
HAU/ml, data not shown). The evaluation of the viral replication in the presence of
exogenous proteases in Vero cells indicated that rAOaV-1 expressing codon

optimized S gene replicated at the level comparable to wild type AOaV-1 (Fig. 1E).
The expression analysis of the S protein by Western blot indicated a potent expression
of the full-length S protein in rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2-infected cells whereas expression
of the HN proteins was detected in both recombinant and wt AOaV-1-infected cells
(Fig. 1F and Fig. 3 supplementary). These results confirm that the expression of the
transgene (S) didn’t interfere with the growth characteristics of the AOaV-1 and could
be a replication competitive vaccine candidate.
Exogenous Trypsin Independent Growth Characteristics of Vaccine Construct.
To initiate virus replication, the F protein of the AOaV-1 has to be cleaved by cellular
proteases22. In order to investigate the pre-requisite of exogenous trypsin-like
extracellular proteases for the infectivity of AOaV-1, eggs-propagated rAOaV-1SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV-1-wt were used to infect Vero cells with a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 1.0 without exogenous trypsin treatment. As expected, the
replication of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 was apparent 6 hours post-infection and the
individually infected cells spread the infection to neighbouring cells within next 12
hours. At 2 days post-infection, as high as 90% of the cells were infected with the
rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and majority of cells co-expressed HN protein of the AOaV-1
and S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 supplementary). Cumulative
fluorescence dynamics, based on either HN or S protein expressions, over the course
of the infection, confirmed a gradual spread of the infection (Fig. 2B). Co-expression
fluorescence profile highlighted the co-localization of both surface proteins (Fig. 2C).
Similar to recombinant AOaV-1, the AOaV-1-wt replicated to a similar extent over the
course of two days post-infection without the need of exogenous extracellular
proteases and saturated level of expression of the HN protein was observed at 48
hours post-infection (Fig. 2D and Fig. 2 supplementary). The cumulative
fluorescence dynamics (Fig. 2E) and fluorescence profile (Fig. 2F) confirmed the
active and progressive expression and HN-specific staining, respectively. Taken
together, these results confirm the active replication, and expression of AOaV-1 and
foreign genes in Vero cells independently of exogenous trypsin.
The rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 is Sensitive to AOaV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Antisera. The
F and HN surface glycoproteins are critical for receptor binding as well as membrane
fusion which are indispensable for virus entry and subsequent initiation of the virus
replication22,23. In contrast, the coronaviruses have only a single enveloped
glycoprotein which perform dual functions of receptor binding and membrane fusion24.
In order to understand the influence of the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 on the
infectivity of recombinant virus, the sensitivities of AOaV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 antisera
were assessed and compared for neutralization. As expected, the AOaV-1-wt was
resistant to mock antiserum neutralization and was almost fully neutralized by the
serum against the AOaV-1 (Fig. 3A). Quantitatively, the anti-AOaV-1 antiserum
reduced the infection of AOaV-1-wt in Vero cells by ~92% compared to the mockneutralization (Fig. 3B). Neutralization analysis of the rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 showed
a significant blockage of the virus replication by pre-incubation and subsequent
infection of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 with either anti-AOaV-1 antiserum or anti-SARSCoV-2 anti-serum (Fig. 3C). There was no neutralization observed upon virus’s
treatment with the naïve mouse control serum. Compared to mock-neutralization, as
high as 90% inhibition of the rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 was observed with anti-AOaV-1
antiserum and ~40% inhibition was noticed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-serum (Fig.
3D). These observations confirm that the incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2

into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity of the AOaV-1 to antiSARS-CoV-2 antiserum and anti-AOaV-1 antiserum.
In Vitro Growth Characterization of the Vaccine Construct. In order to understand
the replication competence of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV-1-wt, a multistep
growth kinetics was evaluated in Vero cells. The time-course quantitative
measurement of the genomic copies confirmed that the expression of the S gene didn’t
interfere with the viral replication and the rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 replicated
competitively and comparability with the AOaV-1-wt (Fig. 4A). The cell lysate from
same experimental setting was used to assess the expression of the AOaV-1
structural proteins. The expression analysis using Western blotting demonstrated that
both AOaV-1-wt (Fig. 4B) and rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4C) progressively
replicated in Vero cells and expressed the HN protein as early as 6 hours postinfection and as late as 2 days after initiation of the infection. These results
demonstrated that the expression of the foreign genes by the AOaV-1 was unable to
further attenuate the replication of the virus and could yield into sufficient viral quantity
in cell culture system.
Stability of Recombinant AOaV-1 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidate. In order to
assess the stability of the foreign gene in the recombinant AOaV-1, the recovered and
S-gene expression-confirmed viruses were passaged in 8-days-old embryonated
chicken eggs for five consecutive passages. Both rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV1-wt replicated substantially in eggs (≥28 HAU/ml, data not shown). The comparative
replication competence was assessed between first and fifth eggs passaged viruses
in Vero cells. The rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 expressing the S protein of the SARS-CoV2 grew efficiently and at the level of the AOaV-1-wt in the first passage as well as after
5th passage in the embryonated eggs (Fig. 5A). Correspondingly, the expression of
the structural protein of the AOaV-1 further confirmed the stable propagation of the wt
and recombinant viruses at least for several passages (Fig. 5B and Fig. 3
supplementary). The sequence integrity of the inserted S gene as well as the P and
M junction was assessed without any mutations. Additionally, sequencing of the S
gene from the first and fifth passages confirmed no unwanted mutations in purified
viruses. These results demonstrate that the rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 expresses S gene
stably and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics
of the recombinants.

Discussion
The precipitously increasing deaths, negative impact on lives and livelihood, and
trembling economies warrant the urgent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which
would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Amongst experimental vaccines being
presented for SARS-CoV-2, the vectored-based vaccines hold potential for effective
vaccine against CoVID-193. However, each viral vector inherit multiple advantages
and disadvantages and careful consideration of gene delivery system may pave the
way for an effective vaccine.
We propose here a pre-tested vaccine vector based on the recombinant apathogenic
strain of AOaV-1 (i.e. NDV). We engineered AOaV-1 to express the full-length S
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which is a vital viral neutralization and major protective
antigen of the virus24. Using exhaustive in vitro characterization of recombinant

vaccine candidate, rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated efficient co-expression of
surface proteins of AOaV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in mammalian cell line. This host-range
restricted replication in mammals is one of the most attractive properties of AOaV-125.
While the mechanism of host range-restriction needs investigations, it is known that
AOaV-1 induces a strong interferon response in mammalian cells which in turn limit
its replication26,27. Additionally, sialic acid receptors for the viral attachment might show
fundamental differences between avian and mammalian hosts and thus define the
host restriction. It has been observed that bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, another
paramyxovirus in the same family, determine the host range restriction through
multiple viral proteins28. Notwithstanding, AOaV-1 are clearly highly restricted to
primates and this selective replication is irrespective of any of the known pathotypes
such as mesogenic or lentogenic strains of AOaV-129.
In addition to above mentioned factors, the AOaV-1 carries a range of advantages
over multiple other vectors. The AOaV-1 are antigenically distinct from viruses that are
known to naturally infect human and AOaV-1 don’t show cross-reactivities with
antibodies raised against other paramyxoviruses. Therefore, AOaV-1 induces strong
immune responses in the human population. Pertinent to this feature and interferon
sensitivity, AOaV-1 are considered a valuable oncolytic agent and thus propose safety
in
human
upon
parenterally
administration30.

Potential
seroconversion and a transient conjunctivitis may occur in poultry health workers,
which subsides within four days without any additional or systemic symptoms31.
Altogether, AOaV-1 presents a pre-tested and proven safety profile in human and may
highlight speeding rolling out of the recombinant vaccines in general human
population.
Similar to other paramyxoviruses, AOaV-1 enters host cells by direct fusion at the
plasma membrane through a pH-independent mechanism32,33. The AOaV-1 can also
enter host cells by an endocytic pathway. The entry of the AOaV-1 in the cell is then
mediated by the surface fusion (F) glycoprotein, which is also a major determinant of
AOaV-1 virulence in birds34. The viral infectivity requires cleavage of the F protein
through the intracellular ubiquitous proteases including furin, allowing disseminated
replication in multiples organs and tissues. A mechanism similar to AOaV-1, rAOaV1-SARS-CoV-2 entry the cells through proteolytic cleavage of the S protein24. The
trypsin-independent infectivity of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2, as was observed in our
study, facilitated the vector propagation in cells culture model as well as embryonated
chicken eggs.
It has previously been shown that insertion of the transgene may allow the vector
sensitive to neutralization by antibodies which are specific to the inserted protein and
may facilitate the seepage of neutralization by vector-specific neutralizing
antibodies25,35. The rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 expresses both the native structural HN
protein as well as S glycoprotein and therefore the entry into the cell may be attributed
to the AOaV-1-like or SARS-CoV-2-like. In conjunction to this hypothesis, the antiAOaV-1 antiserum as well as anti-SARS-CoV-2 could substantially block the entry of
the rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the recombinant AOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2
offers an exciting system to underpin functional interactions between native and
foreign envelope glycoproteins in one viral particle.

Recently, insertion of the foreign genes in the backbone of the AOaV-1 has been
practiced for multiple viruses including influenza, SARS, human immunodeficiency
virus7,35, human parainfluenza, rabies9, Nipah disease10, Rift Valley fever11, Ebola and
highly pathogenic H5N112,13. In several studies, it has been demonstrated that
insertion of the transgene into the genomes of AOaV-1 resulted in reduced
pathogenicity in poultry birds. This safety was maintained even after the expression of
the HA gene from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus11-13. Sustained, stable and
progressive replication of both wt and recombinant viruses demonstrated effective
spread within cells independently.
Taken together, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vector expressing S
protein propagated stably in chicken embryonated eggs for several consecutive
passages, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth
characteristics of the recombinants. The presented respiratory vaccine candidate has
the potential for further development as vaccine vector to be available for expedited
vaccine development for pre-clinical and clinical studies.

Material and Methods
Cells and viruses. AOaV-1-wt vaccine vector was rescued as described previously36,
passaged twice on African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells, and in embryonated
chicken eggs. Vero cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA). These cells were grown in Dulbecco’s minimal essential
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Fertile embryonated
chicken eggs were purchased from Henry Stewart & Co Ltd, UK.
Generation of recombinant AOaV-1 expressing S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The
genome of AOaV-1 encodes six structural genes in the order of nucleocapsid (N),
phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and
RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, also known as L). The transcription of the
linear gene starts from gene start (GS) and ends at the gene-end (GE). Between the
GS and GE, there is an intergenic sequence (IG). The foreign gene can be inserted at
any of the gene junction with variable level of transcription; however, recent studies
have assessed the optimal gene expression when inserted between P and M
gene35,37,38. This arrangement of the gene is identical among all AOaV-1.
In order to offer a competitive reverse genetic system as a novel vaccine vector, an
avirulent strain of AOaV-1 was used carrying lentogenic-alike (e.g. NDV) cleavage site
and pathogenicity (Patent pending on the technology). The full length antigenomic
sequence of AOaV-1, originally isolated from asymptomatic wild birds, was partially
de novo synthesised (NBS Biologicals, UK) using a novel sequence modification
approach. Rest of the genome length mainly constituting around the P gene was
cloned using overlapping PCRs. The entire cassette was then shuttled into the
TVT7R(0,0) (Addgene Plasmid #98631). In order to avoid incorporation of an extra
non-viral gene residues into the transcribed minigenome and efficient transcription of
the gene, an autocatalytic and “rule of six” adhered HHRz was introduced at the 5’end and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HdvRz) at the 3’ end of the antigenome.

An expression cassette for the full-length S gene was first in silico generated,
containing the Kozak sequence, GE, GS, IG and the ORF for the full length S gene
was codon-optimized for homo sapiens codon usage and inserted into the unique
PmeI site between P and M genes, which was originally preserved during the cloning
of complete antigenome. The construct was named rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 whereas
the AOaV-1 without the insertion of the foreign gene (AOaV-1-wt) was used as
infection control throughout the study. The orientation of the inserted S gene was
confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis at the time of cloning as well as during
the propagation of the vector in cells and chicken embryonated eggs.
The rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV-1-wt were used to rescue the infectious viruses
as described previously36 with substantial modifications. Briefly, Vero cells were
infected with Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the T7 polymerase at a
multiplicity of infection 1.0 for 6 hours. These cells were transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 using rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV-1-wt backbones as well as supporting
N, P and L genes expression plasmids (ratio of 1:0.8:0.4:0.1) for 72 hours. After 3 days
post-infection, cells and cell supernatants were mixed and freeze-thaw for three time
at -80 before inoculating into 8-days-old embryonated chicken eggs. After additional
three days, individual eggs were screened using hemagglutination assay and realtime PCR as we described before39-41. Successfully rescued isolates were further
propagated to generate viral stock and for in vitro characterization.
Propagation of viruses in eggs and cells. The infectivity of the recombinant virus
and parental wild type strains were characterized using a standard hemagglutination
assay (HA). The 50% tissue infectious dose (TCID50) assay on Vero cells in 96-well
plates, was performed and calculated following standard procedures39,40,42.

Western blotting. To confirm expression of the viral protein, Vero cells were infected
with recombinant and wild type viruses at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.1 as we
described earlier43. Cell lysates were collected at 24 h post infection, subjected to
Western blot. Briefly, after 24h post-infection, cells were washed one time with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by adding 100 μL ice-cold NP40 lysis buffer
(completed with protease inhibitors cocktail) per well and incubated for 30 min on ice.
All cell lysates were denatured at 98oC for 8 min, proteins were separated by sodium
dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and subsequently
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes43. The cell lysates were subjected for
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant were incubated in
sample loading buffer 2x (Biorad) containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 98
°C, and separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The S and HN viral proteins were detected by
incubation with primary antibodies (1:500 dilution). After probing with primary
antibodies, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated species-specific
secondary antibodies (Abcam) and visualised by chemiluminescence (Chemidoc,
BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), as we performed earlier43.

the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS, and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking of the cells with 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, they were incubated with monoclonal antibody
(mAb)44 to probe HN or S or both proteins. Binding of primary antibodies were
visualized using Alexa 488 α-rabbit and 568 α-mouse secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen). The S and HN proteins expression were analysed through fluorescence
for wild-type and recombinant viruses compared to mock infected cells. The 40,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain cell nuclei and the images were
captured using a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, Kohen, Germany).
Digital images were processed using Adobe illustrator software, and the same
parameters were applied to the whole image area.

Stability and growth characteristics of NDV constructs using real-time PCR. The
stability of recombinant vaccine candidate compared to parental wild type were grown
sequentially in embryonated chicken eggs for at least 5 passages. RNA was extracted
from the allantoic fluid of recombinant and wild type after the first and fifth passages
in eggs using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The real-time qRT-PCR was
performed using SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit to detect
NDV M gene41, which enabled the calculation of viral genome copies that was plotted
against hours post-infection for each of the viruses to produce standard curves. To
investigate the growth properties of the recombinant viruses, Vero cells were infected
in 6-well plates at a moi of 0.1 after washed twice with PBS and an adsorption time of
60 min. Cell supernatants were harvested 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48h after infection (p.i).
Viral titers (50% tissue culture infectious dose, TCID50) were calculated by IFA using
primary antibodies against viral proteins and Alexa FluorTM 488 α-rabbit and Alexa
FluorTM 586 α-mouse as secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively.

mock-neutralization was set to 100%, and the quantitative analysis of the virus
replication was plotted for the AOaV-1 neutralized with antiserum. (C) rAOaV-1-SARSCoV-2 virus was incubated with an anti-AOaV-1 antiserum or SARS-CoV-2 antiserum
for 2 hours before infection of Vero cells for another 24 hours. These cells were then
stained for the expression of the HN glycoprotein of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2. (D)
Quantitative measurement of the staining intensities plotted against the mock-treated
neutralization control. The asterisk indicates the level of significance.

Figure 4. Growth kinetics of the vaccine and wt constructs. (A) Vero cells were
infected with an moi 1.0 of rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 or AOaV-1-wt for 2 hours (0 hour
post infection) and were then replaced with media to be incubated and extraction of
RNA at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours post infection. The viral copy number were calculated from
AOaV-1 standard run in parallel. (B) Vero cells were infected with AOaV-1 and total
cell lysate was prepared at indicated time points post-infection. These lysates were
run for Western blotting using HN antibodies to demonstrate virus replication and
alpha tubulin as loading control. (C) Similar to section B, cells were infected with
rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and the expression for the HN and alpha tubulin was
measured at indicated time points.

Figure 5. Stability replication of AOaV-1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate in
embryonated chicken eggs. (A) The rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 as well as AOaV-1-wt
were propagated in eggs and were quantified in Vero cells. The titre quantification, as
shown in the bar chart, represent comparable replication. Both rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV2 and AOaV-1-wt were consecutively propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for 5
passages and the virus titre was quantified in Vero cells. (B) The first and fifth
passages for both rAOaV-1-SARS-CoV-2 and AOaV-1-wt were used to infect Vero
cells for 24 hours before cell lysis and expression analysis for the HN structural protein
of the rAOaV-1.
