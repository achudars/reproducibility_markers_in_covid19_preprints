Abstract
Large-scale efforts have been persistently undertaken for medical prophylaxis and
treatment of COVID-19 disasters worldwide. A variety of novel viral spike
protein-targeted vaccine preparations have recently been clinically distributed based
on accelerated approval. We revisited the early but inconclusive clinical interest in the
combination of azithromycin and zinc sulfate repurposing with safety advantages. In
vitro proof of concept was provided for rapid and synergistic suppression of ACE2
expression following treatments in human airway cells, Calu-3 and H322M. The two
representative ACE2-expressing human airway cells indicate the upper and lower
respiratory tracts. Prophylactic and early therapeutic roles of azithromycin combined
with zinc are proposed for virus cellular entry prevention potential bridging to
effective antibody production.

Introduction
Cell surface ACE2 of the respiratory tract is a well-established critical entry of
SARS-CoV-2 into infected cells (12, 42, 45). ACE2 mRNA expression was shown to
be reduced from tracheobronchial to bronchioloalvelar regions. ACE2 expression was
upregulated following viral infections (21, 37), interferon exposure (14, 37) and
smokers (21, 37). It was postulated that hyperactivation of the transcription factor
NF-κB following ACE2-mediated viral entry, most likely in nonimmune cells,
including lung epithelial cells, resulted in cytokine release syndrome (11). NF-κB is a
major transcription factor that regulates the genes responsible for both the innate and
adaptive immune responses. Human type II pneumocytes (AT2) are one of the
primary targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection (14). It was shown in an induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2 model that NF-κB signaling was rapidly and
persistently upregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (15).
Azithromycin (AZT), a second-generation macrolide with broad spectrum
antibacterial activity, has drawn very early clinical attention in hot drug repurposing
for the recurrence of COVID-19 patients. (3, 8, 20, 32) In addition to its antimicrobial
activity resulting from inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis (39), AZT has been
shown to protect against viral entry into A549 lung cancer cell lines (40) as well as
viral infections of airway epithelial cells through reduced viral replication and
increased interferon responses (9, 26, 34). AZT was demonstrated in vivo to suppress
NF-κB activation and concomitant pulmonary inflammation (38). TNF-α-induced
NF-κB DNA binding activity, IκBα degradation and IL-6/IL-8 release in tracheal cells
of human origin were shown to be inhibited in vitro following AZT treatments in a

dose-dependent manner (1).
Zinc is a trace element supplement with clinical benefits in a variety of respiratory
tract infections (43). In the United States, one of the major countries with the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was an increased risk of zinc deficiency between 1992
and 2011 (19). Patients with COVID-19 disease had significantly lower serum zinc
levels than normal controls (17). More complications developed in COVID-19
patients with zinc deficiency (17). The prophylactic and therapeutic roles of zinc
supplementation are currently under investigation. (18, 33) Prevention of viral entry
has been postulated to be one potential mechanism of zinc antiviral actions (43).
Increased NF-κB DNA binding activity and IκBα mRNA expression were reported in
lungs from a sepsis model of mice under zinc deficiency (2).
Short-course AZT has long been used clinically for atypical pneumonias with
excellent safety and tolerability. Zinc supplementation is a relatively popular
companion with vitamin complexes. Here, we showed markedly synergistic ACE2
suppression in two distinct ACE2-expressing human airway cells by combination
treatments of AZT and zinc. Accordingly, we provided laboratory support to
repurpose AZT plus zinc for early clinical intervention of COVID-19 disease.

Results and discussion
Because the lung is the primary and lethal organ of COVID-19 disease, Calu-3,
H322M, H522, H460, H1299 and A549 human airway cells were screened for
endogenous ACE2 expression. Calu-3, widely used for COVID-19 studies, and
H322M were selected for subsequent exploration because of their endogenous ACE2
expression (Fig. 1A). The Calu-3 cells generated from human proximal bronchial
adenocarcinoma (36) is characterized by features of differentiated, functional human
airway epithelial cells (6). Calu-3 was also proposed to be a suitable model of the
human nasal mucosa (16). Bronchoalveolar lavage analyses from COVID-19 patients

disclosed aberrant macrophage and T cell responses (22) as well as bronchoalveolar
immune hyperactivation (44). Our drug repurposing for the critical bronchoalveolar
involvement of COVID-19 disease was investigated with H322M, a bronchioalveolar
cell line, in addition to Calu-3 for proximal airway involvement.
Rapid improvements in symptoms, including fever, dyspnea and hypoxia, were
reported in a consecutive case series receiving high-dose zinc rescue with different
preparations. (5) A randomized controlled trial for high-dose intravenous zinc was
initiated as adjunctive therapy in SARS-CoV-2-positive critically ill patients (30).
H322M was therefore treated with 24-hour serial doses of 18.75, 37.5, 75, 150 and
300 µM ZnSO4 (Zn) (Fig. 1B). Zn at 300 µM was determined for the subsequent drug
repurposing combination study because ACE2 expression was potentially decreased
following 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 1B). AZT at 50 µM was required to produce
significant in vitro anti-rhinoviral activities of human bronchial epithelial cells from
donors (9) and children with cystic fibrosis (34). Lower in vitro anti-rhinoviral levels
of AZT were also reported for bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients (26).
Accordingly, H322M was treated with 24-hour serial doses of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and
3.125 µM (Fig. 1C). An AZT concentration of 50 µM was chosen for the Zn
combination because ACE2 expression was significantly decreased following 24
hours of treatment (Fig. 1C).
The most impressive finding of the present study was rapidly suppressed endogenous
ACE2 expression of H322M under 24-hour treatments of 300 µM Zn combined with
50 and 25 µM AZT (Fig. 2A and 3A). Compared to 50 and 25 µM AZT treatments
alone, 300 µM Zn showed a significantly synergistic suppressive effect on ACE2
expression (Fig. 2A and 3A). ACE2 expression was further decreased following
48-hour treatments with Zn and AZT combinations, especially 50 µM AZT (Fig. 2B).
ACE2 mRNA expression of Calu-3 was significantly reduced following 24-hour

treatments of 300 µM Zn alone and in combination with 50 and 25 µM AZT (Fig. 3C).
The markedly suppressive effect on ACE2 protein expression of Calu-3 was found 24
hours later following suppression of its ACE2 expression. Similar to H322M, 48-hour
combination treatment with 300 µM and 50 µM AZT showed the most suppressive
effect on ACE2 expression (Fig. 2D).
Certain NF-κB dimeric transcription factors and their activities are tightly repressed
by 3 inhibitors, IκBα, IκBβ and IκB, through the formation of stable IκB–NF-κB
complexes. It was demonstrated that rapid degradation of free IκBα is critical for
NF-κB activation (24). Our H322M associated results indicated that combination
treatments of Zn and AZT altered IκBα degradation and contributed to rapid
repression of endogenous ACE2 (Fig. 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B). Such synergistic effects
were most prominent following 24-hour treatment with 300 µM Zn and 50 µM AZT
(Fig. 2A and 2B). In contrast to the synergistic effect on IκBα degradation in H322M,
IκBα expression was rapidly upregulated following 24-hour treatments with 300 µM
combined with 50 and 25 µM AZT (Fig. 2C and 3D). A similar synergistic ACE2
suppressive effect was most prominent following 48 hours of 300 µM Zn treatment
combined with 50 µM AZT (Fig. 2C and 2D). Accordingly, the underlying
mechanisms of IκBα involved in ACE2 repression might be cell type specific and
worth further investigation.
Membrane-tethered MUC1 belongs to one of the major components of mucus (29). In
vitro MUC1 overexpression was demonstrated to limit influenza A virus (IAV)
infection (25). It was shown in vivo that MUC1 expression not only impeded IAV but
also reduced IAV disease severity (25). NF-κB activation in vitro via Toll-like
receptor (TLR) pathways, including TLR 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9, was counteracted by
MUC1 overexpression (41). There is increasing evidence and therapeutic interest in
TLR pathway modulations for COVID-19 disease (27, 28, 31). Elevated MUC1

mucin protein levels were found in the airway mucus of critically ill COVID-19
patients (23). Another interesting finding of the present study was that MUC1
expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells was most significantly increased following 24
hours of treatment with 300 µM Zn alone and to a lesser degree after treatment with
50 and 25 µM AZT (Fig. 4A and 4B).
The largest published retrospective case series reported that early outpatient treatment
with zinc plus low-dose hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin significantly reduced
the hospitalization rate (4). Compared with the hydroxychloroquine-based standard of
care, the addition of AZT did not show improved clinical outcomes in an open-label
multicenter randomized clinical trial performed among patients with severe
respiratory COVID-19 disease in Brazil (7). On the other hand, large-scale
randomized trials did not reveal the clinical benefits of hydroxychloroquine in
patients with COVID-19 (10, 35). Accordingly, the feasible clinical timing and choice
of combinations with AZT remain to be determined.
A computed model of the AZT-Zn++ complex demonstrated its potential against the
replication and assembly of SARS-CoV-2 particles. We are the first to present in vitro
evidence that Zn combined with AZT rapidly and significantly suppresses endogenous
ACE2 expression and increases MUC1 expression in Calu-3 and H322M cells,
representative of the human upper and lower respiratory tracts, respectively. Both
ACE2 suppression and increased MUC1 expression were consistently demonstrated
in the two human airway cells, indicating the prophylactic as well as early therapeutic
potential of the AZT and Zn repurposing combination for COVID-19 disease. With
threats of mutations located on the viral spike protein (13), we demonstrated a
potentially rapid bridging way to effective antibody production by suppressing the
key of virus cellular entry with fewer concerns of increasing viral mutations as well as
safety and storage of novel vaccine preparations. The effective high-dose combination

Cell lines and drug treatments
The H322M, H522, H460 and A549 human airway cells were courtesy of SLY
(National Taiwan University), and the H1299 lung cancer cell line was courtesy of
CCH (National Taiwan University Hospital). Calu-3 human upper airway cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA,
USA). The Calu-3 cells were cultured with MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100
mM sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids and penicillin-streptomycin in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The H322M cells were cultured with RPMI medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
After seeding at a density of 1×106 cells per 6-well plate, Calu-3 and H322M cells
were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The culture medium was removed and
replaced with fresh medium in the presence of (i) 25 μM azithromycin (MCE,
Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), (ii) 50 μM azithromycin, and (iii) 300 μM Zn
(Sigma-Aldrich, ST. Louis, MO, USA), (iv) 300 μM Zn and 25 μM azithromycin, (v)
300 μM Zn and 50 μM azithromycin, and incubated for 24 or 48 hours.

RNA concentration and quality were assessed using the Quibit 3.0 Fluorometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA samples were stored at −80 °C.

Reverse transcription (RT)
RT reactions were carried out using the superscript III first strand synthesis system

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was synthesized starting from 2

μg of purified total RNA. The reactions in a final volume of 20 μl contained 1x Buffer,

DTT, dNTPs, superscript III RT, and 500 ng oligo(dT). Samples were incubated at 65 °C

for 5 minutes and 50 °C for 60 minutes, and then the RT enzyme was inactivated by

heating to 70 °C for 15 minutes. cDNA samples were stored at -20 °C.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
qPCR was carried out with KAPA SYBR®FAST qPCR Master Mix (Wilmington, MA, USA)

in a final volume of 20 μl, with 0.3 μM forward and reverse primer and 1 μl of cDNA.

Fluorescent detection was performed using the ABI 7500 fast System (Thermo Fisher

Scientific) with the following thermal cycling conditions: initial polymerase activation

at 95 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 3 seconds

and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 30 seconds. After amplification, dissociation

(melting) curve analysis was performed to analyze the product melting temperature.

Each sample was amplified in triplicate wells. Negative (no template) controls were

subjected to western blot analysis. Protein samples were first separated by
SDS–PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. Primary antibodies were
applied to detect specific protein expression, followed by incubation with appropriate
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein signals were developed using an
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Biomate, Taiwan) and detected by a BIO-RAD
ChemiDocTM MP imaging system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Western blots
were carried out with ACE-2 antibody (Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA), IKB-α antibody

Figure Legends
Figure 1 Azithromycin (AZT) but not ZnSO4 (Zn) treatment alone decreased
endogenous ACE2 expression in the human lower airway H322M cells. (A)
Endogenous ACE2 expression was screened by Western blot using beta-actin as a
loading control. ACE2-expressing Calu-3 and H322M cell lines were selected for
subsequent exploration. (B) H322M cells were treated with serial concentrations of
Zn (0, 18.75, 37.5, 75, 150 and 300 µM) for 24 hours, and total RNA was collected
for ACE2 quantitation by real-time qRT-PCR assays. The data were normalized to
GAPDH expression and presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). ACE2 expression was
potentially decreased under 24-hour treatment with 300 µM Zn. This concentration
was determined for combination treatment with AZT. (C) H322M cells were treated
with a concentration series of AZT (0, 3.125, 3.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 µM) for 24 hours,
and total RNA was collected for ACE2 quantitation by real-time qRT-PCR assays. The
data were normalized to GAPDH expression and presented as the mean ± SEM (n =
3). ( **p = 0.001 to 0.01 ). ACE2 expression was significantly decreased under
24-hour treatment with 50 µM AZT. This concentration was adopted for combination
treatment with Zn.

Figure 2 Endogenous ACE2 expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells was markedly
suppressed by Zn and in combination with AZT in a time- and dose-dependent

manner. (A and B) H322M cells were treated with 25, 50 µM AZT and 300 µM Zn in
combination for 24 (A) and 48 (B) hours. Treated cells were lysed for Western blot
analysis of ACE2 and PARP with α-actin as a loading control. ACE2 expression was
suppressed without detectable cleaved PARP by Zn alone and synergistically with
AZT in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IKB-α expression was obviously
increased following 24 hours of treatment with 300 µM Zn combined with 50 µM
AZT. (C and D) Calu-3 cells were treated with 25, 50 µM AZT and 300 µM Zn in
combination for 24 (C) and 48 (D) hours. Compared to H322M treated in the same
ways, ACE2 expression was suppressed without detectable cleaved PARP by Zn alone
and synergistically with AZT in a more time-dependent manner. Similarly, IKB-α
expression was obviously increased following 24 hours of treatment with 300 µM Zn
combined with 50 µM AZT.

Figure 3 Endogenous ACE2 and IKBα expression was synergistically regulated
by combined treatments of Zn and AZT. (A and B) H322M cells were treated with
25, 50 µM AZT and 300 µM Zn in combination for 24 hours. Total RNA was
collected for ACE2 (A) and IKBα (B) quantitation by real-time qRT-PCR assays. The
data were normalized to GAPDH expression and presented as the mean ± SEM (n =
3). (*p = 0.01 to 0.05, ** p = 0.001 to 0.01, ***p = 0.0001 to 0.001 and ****p = <
0.0001). Compared to the control and AZT alone, 300 µM Zn synergistically
decreased ACE2 and IKBα expression with 25 and 50 µM AZT treatments,
respectively. (C and D) Calu-3 cells were treated with 25, 50 µM AZT and 300 µM
Zn in combination for 24 hours. Total RNA was collected for ACE2 (A) and IKBα (B)
quantitation by real-time qRT-PCR assays. The data were normalized to

mean ± SEM (n = 3). (*p = 0.01 to 0.05, ** p = 0.001 to 0.01, ***p = 0.0001 to 0.001
and ****p = < 0.0001). Zn showed a similar synergistic suppressive effect on ACE2
expression in AZT treated Calu-3 cells. Conversely, IKBα expression was
synergistically upregulated following 25 and 50 µM AZT treatments combined with
300 µM Zn compared to AZT alone.

Figure 4 Endogenous MUC1 expression was significantly increased by Zn
treatment alone and to a lesser degree in combination with AZT. H322M (A) and
Calu-3 (B) cells were treated with 25, 50 µM AZT and 300 µM Zn in combination for
24 hours. Total RNA was collected for MUC1 quantitation by real-time qRT-PCR
assays. The data were normalized to GAPDH/RPLP0 expression for H322M/Calu-3
cells respectively and are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). (*p = 0.01 to 0.05, **
p = 0.001 to 0.01, ***p = 0.0001 to 0.001 and ****p = < 0.0001). Compared to the
control, MUC1 expression was significantly increased following 300 µM Zn
treatment alone and to a lesser degree combined with AZT in H322M and Calu-3 cells.
In H322M, MUC1 expression was synergistically increased following 50 µM AZT
treatments combined with 300 µM Zn compared to AZT alone. In Calu-3 cells, MUC1
expression was synergistically increased following 25 and 50 µM AZT treatments
combined with 300 µM Zn compared to AZT alone.
