Abstract
With a view to extending testing capabilities for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic we have
developed a test that lowers cost and does not require real time quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We developed a reverse transcription
nested PCR endpoint assay (RT-nPCR) and showed that RT-nPCR has comparable performance
to the standard RT-qPCR test. In the course of comparing the results of both tests, we found
that the standard RT-qPCR test can have low detection efficiency (less than 50%) in a real
testing scenario which may be only partly explained by low viral representation in many
samples. This finding points to the importance of directly monitoring detection efficiency in
test environments. We also suggest measures that would improve detection efficiency.

Introduction
The continuing Covid-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for increased diagnostic tests
worldwide. The requirement of tests has exceeded the normal testing capacities available in
public and private hospitals and clinical research laboratories and also strained financial
resources. The most widely deployed type of test for identifying individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2, based on recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and
national health centres such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
detects the presence of viral RNA. The method employs real time quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal
(NP) swab samples, to measure amplification of a short segment of a viral gene in the course
of a PCR reaction following reverse transcription of viral RNA. Performing the RT-qPCR test
requires a real time thermal cycler which is an expensive instrument. Most major research
laboratories are equipped with only a limited number and smaller laboratories may have none
which has placed constraints on the number of tests as well as places for conducting them.
Further, the need for fluorescent oligonucleotide probes adds to the cost of the tests. A
number of new diagnostic testing methods aimed at reducing the dependence on expensive
equipment and kits that are in short supply have been proposed and are under development
for deployment (Broughton et al., 2020; Rauch et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). However, given
the enormous and widespread current need for diagnostic testing in diverse environments it
is equally important to increase the utilization of existing research capabilities that have
potential but are currently not being used for testing, through the use of tests that employ
more widely available equipment and reagents using simple established methods.
In order to extend the scope of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 we explored a reverse
transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) approach that does not depend on RT-qPCR but uses
standard RT-PCR as part of an endpoint assay. We developed and tested a RT-nPCR protocol
comprising a multiplex primary RT-PCR for amplification of four SARS-CoV-2 amplicons and a
control human RPP30 amplicon followed by a secondary nested PCR for individual amplicons

and visualization by agarose gel electrophoresis. We also examined the use of RT-nPCR in
pooled testing and in direct amplification without RNA isolation.
RNA isolated from NP swab samples that had been previously tested using one of two RTqPCR tests was examined using RT-nPCR and the results compared. We found that taking both
standard RT-qPCR tests together, the RT-nPCR test was able to correctly identify 90% of
samples detected as positive by RT-qPCR and also detected 13% samples as positive among
samples that were negative by the standard RT-qPCR test (likely false negatives). Based on
the experimentally measured false negative rate by RT-nPCR tests from this study we
estimated that as many as 50% of positive samples may escape detection in single pass testing
by RT-qPCR in an actual testing scenario.
Results
Nested RT-PCR test development
We designed 40 sets of nested oligonucleotide primers for specifically amplifying different
regions of SARS-CoV-2 and not SARS-CoV based on available sequence information (Genbank
ID NC_004718.3 for SARS-CoV and MT050493.1 for SARS-CoV-2). These primers were tested
for amplification by a primary PCR, followed by a second round of nested PCR. The starting
template was cDNA prepared from a pool of RNA isolated from two NP swab samples that
had previously been identified as positive using a RT-qPCR diagnostic kit. From a set of 40
candidate amplicons we selected 4 amplicons that gave visible amplification in the primary
PCR and strong bands in the secondary PCR reaction as visualized by agarose gel
electrophoresis. The primer sequences for these amplicons were checked against 78 SARSCoV-2 sequences from Indian isolates. Except for a single mismatch with two sequences in
the middle for two primers, all primers were 100% identical to all 78 sequences. These
amplicons comprised portions of Orf1ab, M, and N genes (Figure 1A; Table 1). The amplified
bands were excised from the agarose gel, the DNA was extracted, and identity of each band
was confirmed by sequencing. Similarly a set of nested primers was developed for the human
RPP30 gene as a control. To test efficiency of amplification we used a dilution series of
amplicons as templates in primary and secondary PCR. 1-10 molecules of DNA in dilutions of

isolated viral amplicons could be detected by nested PCR (Figure 1B). To detect the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 in RNA isolated from NP swabs we performed a multiplex one-step RT-PCR on
RNA from positive and negative samples using pooled primers for the four viral amplicons
together with human RPP30 control. The product of the primary one-step RT-PCR was used
as template in separate nested secondary PCR reactions for each of the amplicons followed
by detection using agarose gel electrophoresis. Using the nested RT-PCR assay we were able
to detect amplification of the four viral amplicons in RNA from positive samples and no
amplification was detected in negative samples (Figure 2).
Pooled and direct testing
Pooled testing has been used for SARS-Co-V2 detection (Yelin et al., 2020). In order to assess
the suitability of the RT-nPCR test for analysis of pooled samples, we performed the test on
three sets of pooled samples comprising RNA isolated from different dilutions of a positive
sample in a pool of ten negative samples. For a sample having a cycle threshold (Ct) value of
38.7 for the E gene, the RT-nPCR test gave robust detection in RNA from undiluted sample
(positive for 3 out of 4 viral amplicons) and less robustly at a dilution of 1:5 (positive for 1 out
of 4 viral amplicons; Figure 3). For two samples having a Ct value of 28.7 and 34.5, the RTnPCR test successfully detected presence at a dilution of 1:20. Hence the RT-nPCR test was
able to detect presence of all three samples in a pool of 1:5.
Direct testing of samples by RT-qPCR without RNA isolation has been described in recent
reports (Bruce et al., 2020; Merindol et al., 2020; Smyrlaki et al., 2020). We performed direct
testing of heat inactivated positive samples by the RT-nPCR test. Using 3 Âµl of swab sample
directly, which corresponds to 1/5 of the amount used in testing of isolated RNA, the RT-nPCR
test detected a positive sample having an E gene Ct value of 27.9 but not a sample having a
higher Ct of 32.7 (Figure 4). Using a higher volume of swab sample gave weaker amplification
suggesting the presence of an inhibitor in the VTM. We observed improved amplification
when polyvinylpyrrolidone was included in the PCR reaction. Passage of the sample through
a Sephadex-G50 spin column also relieved the inhibition and gave improved amplification.
Overall the RT-nPCR test is capable of detecting positives directly in swab samples but at a
reduced sensitivity compared to isolated RNA.

Comparison of RT-nPCR with RT-qPCR
In order to compare the performance of RT-nPCR with that of standard RT-qPCR we tested
RNA samples that had tested positive by RT-qPCR. Samples that were positive for at least two
amplicons out of four by RT-nPCR were called positive, samples that were positive for one
amplicon were considered ambiguous and not included in the comparison, and samples that
were negative for all four amplicons were called negative. We compared RT-nPCR test results
to sets of positive and negative RNA samples that had been tested by either of two RT-qPCR
protocols, one provided by National Institute of Virology (NIV), India (derived from Charite,
Berlin and CDC, USA protocols), and the other a commercial LabGun RT-qPCR kit
(LabGenomics, Korea). The results indicated that the agreement between the RT-nPCR and
NIV tests could be rated as moderate (Cohenâs Kappa = 0.612, 95% CI: 0.42-0.81) (McHugh,
2012) while that between the RT-nPCR and LabGun tests could be rated as almost perfect
(Cohenâs Kappa = 0.905, 95% CI: 0.80-1.0;)(Figure 5). The lower agreement with the NIV set
was due to 10 samples that were negative by the NIV protocol but positive in the RT-nPCR
test. The mean number of positive amplicons for these 10 samples was 3.3 indicating that
they were likely to be true positives (i.e. false negatives). Based on the number of RNA
samples that were negative in the RT-qPCR tests but positive by RT-nPCR we derived an
estimate of the proportion of positive samples that were being detected by the NIV and
LabGun RT-qPCR tests (Table 2). The NIV set covered 400 samples and had a prevalence rate
(% positives) of 15%. The detection efficiency for this set was calculated to be 0.47. The
LabGun set comprised 1186 samples and had a prevalence rate of 3.7%. The detection
efficiency for the second set was estimated to be 0.44. Therefore our estimate suggests that
a high proportion of positive samples (upto 50% or more) can be missed by the standard RTqPCR test in a real testing scenario.
Discussion
The RT-nPCR test described above does not require a real time thermal cycler and can be
performed in a laboratory that has basic molecular biology equipment, a thermal cycler, and
a BSL2 room with Class II laminar flow hood. It uses well-established methodologies and

reagents that are widely available and can serve as a basis for broadening the scope of testing
for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the RT-nPCR test was comparable to RT-qPCR and the
cost of consumables for the test based on list prices is around US $ 7 per test about half of
which is the cost of RNA isolation. The test uses two rounds of PCR amplification which does
increase potential for contamination. However we found that by following a set of practices
described in a detailed protocol (Supplementary file 1), contamination could be avoided.
In the course of comparing the RT-nPCR and standard RT-qPCR tests we estimated from the
rate of experimentally determined false negatives, that a high proportion (about 50%) of
positive samples were being missed by the RT-qPCR test applied in a single pass testing
protocol. This is a high escape rate which poses a concern in individual diagnosis and merits
monitoring and greater comparison of results across testing scenarios. We also suggest that
detection can be improved by repeat testing of isolated RNA and by increasing the number of
amplicons tested.
The existence of false negatives in the RT-qPCR test has been inferred in a number of studies
that compared clinical test and symptomatic data with RT-qPCR testing information (Kucirka
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020). Several studies have compared the performance
of different RT-qPCR kits on RNA from clinical samples primarily to assess the performance of
the kits, and have found agreement as well as differences that also point to the existence of
false negative test results (Hogan et al., 2020; Pujadas et al., 2020; van Kasteren et al., 2020;
Xiong et al., 2020). However, direct experimental analysis of RT-qPCR negative RNA samples
at testing centres using different but related RT-PCR based tests as a way of estimating
detection efficiency has received limited attention likely because of the high demand for
diagnostic tests, shortage of testing kits, and cost of testing. The low detection efficiency that
we have estimated may not be entirely explained by a low representation of the virus in many
of the samples as the mean number of positive amplicons by RT-nPCR for the 12 false
negatives (10 NIV + 2 LabGun) was 3.25 (Figure 5). Possible alternative explanations are
variability in test performance or in representation of different portions of the viral RNA. Low
detection efficiency could be a possible concern in other tests including those under
development that are based on reverse transcription as a first step followed by DNA
amplification and detection (Broughton et al., 2020; Rauch et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). Many

RT-qPCR tests use RNA corresponding to about 1% of swab sample. Increasing the amount of
sample for RNA isolation and concentration of the sample are possible options for improving
detection, however these would also increase the number of operations and expense, and it
would need to be assessed whether this would be compatible with medium to high
throughput protocols. Protocols based on initial detection of a single amplicon followed by a
confirmatory test for a second amplicon may also contribute to false negatives and lower
detection.
In conclusion the RT-nPCR endpoint assay for SARS-CoV-2 described above uses widely
available reagents, lowers costs, and obviates the need for a real time time thermal cycler.
The assay can therefore be performed in a large number of clinical and diagnostic laboratories
lacking this expensive piece of equipment essential for RT-qPCR testing. The performance of
RT-nPCR is comparable to RT-qPCR and analysis of RT-qPCR tested samples by RT-nPCR shows
a high escape rate in detection of positives, highlighting a need for directly monitoring
detection efficiency through assessment of false negatives in real testing environments. As
more regions of the world move into community transmission phase, there is also a greater
need for surveillance testing. Pooled testing by RT-nPCR can contribute to meeting this
requirement.

sample was lysed in BSL3 facility. RNA isolation steps were carried out in BSL2 facility. RNA
was eluted in 50 Âµl of water. For pooled sample RNA isolation, positive sample was pooled
with negative samples in 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 ratios comprising 140 Âµl of NP sample and isolated
as above. All safety precautions were followed as per ICMR-NIV guidelines.
Primer design and PCR:
SARS-CoV-2 full length genomic sequence of an isolate from Kerala - India was downloaded
from NCBI (Genbank ID MT050493.1). Primers were designed for regions specific for SARSCoV-2, but not SARS-CoV (Genbank ID NC_004718. For the human RPP30 gene (Genbank ID
U77665.1) primers were designed on exon-exon junctions to avoid genomic DNA
amplification. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Bioserve, Hyderabad. Pooled RNA from
two previously identified positive NP swab samples was used for first strand cDNA synthesis
(Takara primescript kit cat # 6110A). 20 Âµl of the cDNA reaction was diluted ten-fold and used
for primary PCR. Primary PCR was performed using EmeraldAmpÂ® GT PCR Master Mix (Takara
cat# RR310A) 10 ul, forward and reverse primers (5 ÂµM) 1 Âµl each, diluted cDNA 3 Âµl, and
water 5 Âµl. Thermal cycling conditions were 1) 95 Â°C - 2 minutes 2) 95 Â°C - 15 seconds 3) 60 Â°C
- 15 seconds 4) 72 Â°C - 30 seconds 5) Repeat steps 2-4 for 4 cycles 6) 95 Â°C - 15 seconds 7) 55
Â°C - 15 seconds 8) 72 Â°C - 30 seconds 9) Repeat steps 6-8 for 39 cycles 10) 72 Â°C - 2 minutes
11) 15 Â°C â hold. The primary PCR product was diluted fifty-fold and 1 Âµl was used for
secondary PCR using a nested primer pair. Thermal cycling conditions were the same as for
primary PCR. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and
visualized on a UV gel documentation system. For amplicon dilution experiments, bands were
excised from the gel, DNA was extracted (Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin kit, Cat # 740609.250)
and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The insert was PCR amplified from a plasmid
DNA clone, followed by gel purification and extraction. DNA was quantified by a Qubit dsDNA
HS kit (Thermofisher Cat # Q32851).
RT-nPCR:
Primary RT-PCR and secondary PCR was performed using the Primescript III 1-step RT-PCR kit
and EmeraldAmp GT PCR Mix (Takara; detailed protocol provided in Supplementary File 1).
For direct testing of sample without RNA isolation NP sample was heat inactivated at 95 Â°C
for 10 minutes in BSL3. 1 Âµl of 5 % PVP40 (Sigma cat# PVP40-500G) was included in Primary

Figure 3: Detection efficiency of RT-nPCR test in pooled samples.
Samples with different Ct values for E gene pooled at different dilutions with
negative samples. Each pool was tested for amplification of 4 amplicons. UD:
undiluted.
Figure 4: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-nPCR without RNA isolation.
A) Relief of inhibition at higher sample volumes by adding 0.5 % of PVP. Lanes 1-4: E
gene Ct = 27.9; Lanes 5-8: E gene Ct = 32.7. Lanes 1,5: 1 Âµl; 2,6: 3 Âµl; 3,7: 5 Âµl; 4,8:
5 Âµl + 0.5 % PVP.
B) Relief of inhibition at higher volume of NP swab sample by passing through
Sephadex G-50 spin column. Lane 1, 2: 3 Âµl and 9 Âµl of NP swab sample. Lane 3, 4:
3 Âµl and 9 Âµl of NP swab sample after passing through Sephadex G-50 column.

Figure 5: Comparison of RT-nPCR and RT-qPCR tests
A) Contingency table of RT-nPCR with RT-qPCR tests. Samples that were positive for
only one amplicon by RT-nPCR were considered ambiguous and excluded from
analysis. The number of ambiguous samples was: from NIV set: Positives 0/20,
Negatives 3/50; LabGun set: Positives 4/30, Negatives 2/41.
B) Graph showing number of amplicons amplified by RT-nPCR of samples having a
range of Ct values for E gene. Ct 25-31 (n = 21), Mean = 4.0; Ct 31-37 (n = 18), Mean
= 3.61; Ct 37-40 (n = 11), Mean = 2.18.
