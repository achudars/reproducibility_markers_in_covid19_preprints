It is of special significance to find a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) that can induce T cell and B cell -mediated immune responses. There is currently no vaccine to
prevent COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface
glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent
linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the
epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce
interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which
composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant.
Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining
the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional
structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and
MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein
L7/L12 was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.

In early 2020, COVID-19 began generating headlines all over the world because of the extraordinary
speed of its transmission. So, there are rising concerns about community infections. Vaccination is one of
the most effective tools to prevent infectious diseases [1][2]. As far as our knowledge concerns, there is
no report about developing COVID-19 multi epitope vaccine. Therefore, we became eager to design

potent multiepitope vaccines from antigenic sites of coronavirus surface glycoprotein. The
multiepitope vaccines have advantageous over conventional vaccines with regards to safety
profile and high immunogenicity [3]. Multiepitope vaccines have the potential to induce
responses restricted by a wide variety of HLA molecules and generate a balanced CD4+ and
CD8+ cellular immune response. Another molecule that contribute to innate immunity contains
TLR3 that activates antiviral mechanism during infection. Recently, in silico design of epitopebased vaccines has been done for vaccine developing against many infectious diseases. Some
bioinformatics tools could facilitate the development of multi epitope-based vaccines. The
computational tools can optimize the extensive immunological data such as antigen presentation
and processing to achieve specific interpretations [4]. In recent decades, several vaccines were

established based on in silico methods that include efficient vaccines against Toxoplasma gondii
[5], Brucella abortus [6], Escherichia coli [7], Vibrio cholera [8], Human immunodeficiency
virus-1 [9], Hepatitis C virus [10] and many others. In several experimental studies, the efficacy
of computationally designed vaccines has been recently approved for use in defined human
vaccines [11][13]. In this study, in silico analysis were performed to determine exclusive B cell
and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus surface glycoprotein that are antigenically most significant
for coronavirus. In our research, some unique exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from
coronavirus surface glycoprotein were selected based on their antigenicity, stability and length.
The selected epitopes were merged into each other using suitable linkers for organization of final
vaccine construct. Consequently, the stability and efficacy of the vaccines were predicted by a
set of bioinformatics methods.

Initially, coronavirus surface glycoprotein was studied for determining specific conserved part of protein
between the virus serotypes. Results of protein BLAST are shown in Table 1. The results demonstrated
that coronavirus surface glycoprotein had the most conservancy levels between 97. 8 and 100. Also,
VaxiJen score of the protein showed high antigenicity. Due to having good antigenicity, high exposure
probability to the immune system and high conservancy, this protein was selected for vaccine design.

122

3.2 T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction

123
124
125
126
127
128

In the current study, some appropriate common B-cell and T-cell epitopes were designed. The predicted
MHC-I and MHC-II restricted epitopes were compared to B-cell epitopes to determine shared epitopes
(Table 2). Finally, 17 epitopes with 9-16 amino acids were selected. These epitopes are located between
residues 14-642. These epitopes exhibited a relatively high aliphatic index (>60), high antigenicity (>1.6)
and low instability index (less than 20). The most potent epitope was repeated three times and merged
into the other epitopes using suitable linkers (KK, AYY) for organization of final vaccine construct.

129

3.3 Antigen selectivity of constructed vaccines

130
131
132

Final construct vaccine was composed of 398 amino acids which were respectively attached to 50S
ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. The antigenicity score of constructed vaccine are shown in
Table 3. The result demonstrated that IV1 has 1.2110 antigenicity (Table 3).

133

3.4 Physicochemical properties

134
135
136
137
138
139

Physicochemical properties of the constructed vaccine were predicted using Protparam server. The results
revealed that this multi-epitope vaccine have low instability “as a value below 40” predicts that the
protein is stable. The IV1 construct showed the highest Isoelectric point with 8.52 value. From the
aliphatic Index of view, this construct showed aliphatic index more than 90 % (Table 4). The results of
gor4 demonstrated that the random coil values of the IV1 were high compared to Alpha helix and
extended structure.

140

3.5 Analysis of docking results

141
142
143
144
145

The results of docking the constructions with HLA-1 and HLA-2 confirmed the high values with IV1
construct. Also, the results of TLR-3 analysis showed values of 1680.569 for IV1 which demonstrate the
high efficacy of vaccine construct (Tables 5). Figure 2 indicate docking results of the Vac1 construct
with the TLR-3 as the examples of vaccines potential for interaction. The results showed that TLR-3 have
interaction to Glu115, Gly 118 residues of AV1.

146
147

2.10 IFNγ analysis

148
149

The result of IFNγ analysis was described in Table 6. The result demonstrates that among 17 epitopes ,16
epitopes have potential to produce IFN-γ. Epitope 6 showed the highest score with value of 2.

4. Discussion

152
153
154
155

Due to the nature of coronavirus and high infectious rate, the progress of a vaccine against coronavirus is
very challenging. Though, with the development of computational methods, these limitations are reduced.
By the way, using computational methods, the design of recombinant vaccines and the estimation of
physicochemical properties as well as vaccines efficacy could be available [20] [21]. Then, this research

was intended to design an effective multi-epitope recombinant vaccine against coronavirus using a unique
multi-step bioinformatics approach. Our potent multi-epitope vaccine is contained seventeen epitopes in
surface glycoprotein of coronavirus along with AAY and KK linkers and 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12
as adjuvant. Based on our knowledge, there is no report about computational design of epitope-based
vaccine for coronavirus. Recently, in silico, design of epitope-based vaccine was used for vaccine
development against several infectious diseases. Several bioinformatics tools have been established that
accelerate the growth of multi epitope-based vaccines. In recent decade, several multiepitope vaccines for
pathogenic viruses have been reported. Multi epitope vaccines could provide an effective immunization
against different serotypes of a pathogen. Despite mentioned advantages of Multi epitope vaccines, poor
immunogenicity is considered as a major drawback to growth of these vaccines [22], [23]. The in-silico
results proposed that our multi-epitope vaccine was very stable with high aliphatic index and it was
potentially antigenic. As reported earlier, high aliphatic index shows the higher thermos-stability of the
constructed vaccine. At the present research, the aliphatic index was high, and instability was low and
Gravy indices were negative. Also, the higher PI, as the case of this study, shows the higher potential for
cell wall attachment. However, the proposed vaccine has high antigenicity. This was chosen for docking
studies. The results demonstrated that our mentioned vaccine could be a right candidate for experimental
research [24].

Conclusion

174
175
176

This study introduced designing novel multi epitope vaccines against Coronavirus which could cover
conserve sequence of the virus. The multi-epitope vaccine presented by this study showed promising
result through in silico step, which could be followed by in vitro and in vivo studies.
