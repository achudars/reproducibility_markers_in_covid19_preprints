Our understanding of protective vs. pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is limited by inadequate profiling of patients at
the extremes of the disease severity spectrum. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell
immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from
outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic
analyses reveal widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal
COVID-19, with the most profound disturbances including a prominent neutrophil
hyperactivation signature and monocytes with anti-inflammatory features. We further
demonstrate that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19.
Collectively, our results reveal disease severity-associated immune phenotypes in COVID-19
and identify pathogenesis-associated pathways that are potential targets for therapeutic
intervention.
One Sentence Summary: Single-cell profiling demonstrates multifarious dysregulation of

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), is an urgent public health crisis. COVID-19 has a highly variable disease
course: approximately 20% of infected individuals require hospitalization, ~5% require critical
care, and as many as 40% of cases are asymptomatic (1, 2). As the immune response to SARSCoV-2 is a key determinant of COVID-19 severity and outcome, understanding the
immunological underpinnings of COVID-19 pathogenesis is critical to predict, prevent, and treat
SARS-CoV-2 infection and to prepare for the possibility of future infections caused by emerging
betacoronaviruses that may be introduced from existing reservoirs (3–6).

Severe COVID-19 is associated with a number of distinct immunological signatures. For
example, increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IP-10, and
TNFα and the alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 are associated with worse outcomes (7–12).
Patients with less severe disease tend to have both lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines
and higher levels of tissue repair factors (9). COVID-19 also reconfigures leukocyte phenotype
in a severity-specific fashion, with severe COVID-19 associated with lymphocyte exhaustion
(13–15), neutrophil activation signatures (16–20), and hematopoietic alterations (15, 21). While
many of these findings have been established through transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, the
gene regulatory changes underlying severe disease manifestations have not been determined.

Comparatively less is known about the features of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 that
protect against severe disease, as most cohorts profiled to date have included only hospitalized
patients. Neutralizing antibodies and virus-specific T cell responses have been detected in mildly
symptomatic patients, providing evidence of a successful adaptive immune response across the
disease spectrum (22–27). Notably, patients with mild COVID-19 have much lower levels of
proinflammatory plasma cytokines, suggesting that the immune response in mild disease can
eradicate the virus without triggering the hyperinflammatory state observed in severe cases (9,
11). Therefore, to define protective versus pathological features of the immune response, we
aimed to profile both mild (WHO score 1-3, no oxygen requirement), moderate (WHO score 4-5,
noninvasive oxygen requirement), and severe (WHO score 6-8, intubated) cases of COVID-19.
To map the immune response at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic level, we
performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) on the peripheral
immune cells of a cohort of COVID-19 patients across the entire spectrum of disease severity.
We discovered many immunological perturbations associated with disease severity, including
robust signatures related to neutrophil activation along with dysfunction of monocytes, type 2
conventional dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. In addition, we found strong evidence
for emergency myelopoiesis in fatal disease. We also identified epigenetic changes correlated to
these transcriptional and proteomic changes, demonstrating coordinated changes in regulatory
element accessibility and transcription at key pro-inflammatory cytokine-encoding genes in
monocytes. Together, this dataset reveals novel mechanistic insights into the pathological and
protective mechanisms of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS
A trimodal single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to SARS-CoV-2
To investigate how immune responses vary between different severities of COVID-19, we
profiled peripheral blood immune cells from 64 patients with COVID-19 and 12 healthy controls
with three high-dimensional single-cell modalities: Seq-Well (28, 29)-based scRNA-seq (33
patients, 8 controls; including 7 patients previously profiled by our group (15)), scATAC-seq (18
patients, 7 controls), and CyTOF (64 patients, 12 controls; Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A-B). Importantly,
we profiled COVID-19 patients across the full range of the disease severity spectrum, including
patients with mild disease (WHO score 1-3, see Methods) and hospitalized inpatients with
moderate disease (WHO score 4-5) as well as critically ill patients with severe disease (WHO
ordinal score 6-8). We scored patients by both peak severity (denoted by the colors of
cells/patients) and severity at time of sample collection (separated as groups for box plots). The
median age of profiled patients was 43.5 years and 51% were female (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1B, Table
S1). The majority of patients were sampled during the acute phase of infection; 13 mild and
moderately-ill patients were sampled in the convalescent phase (>21 days after first positive
nasopharyngeal swab). Demographic information, additional clinical metadata, and the
modalities applied to each sample are available in Table S1.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sampled by all modalities; additionally, we
processed red blood cell-lysed whole blood by scRNA-seq to profile granulocytes like
neutrophils (see Fig. 5), and we processed isolated NK cells by CyTOF with a panel enabling
deep interrogation of NK cell receptor expression (see Fig. 4; Fig. 1A). In total, we analyzed
~175,000 single transcriptomes, ~50,000 single chromatin accessibility profiles, and >3.2 million
single proteomic profiles (Fig. 1A, Tables S2-5). After performing modality-specific quality
control procedures (see Methods), we created a merged feature matrix of all profiled samples
which we subjected to dimensionality reduction, graph-based clustering, and cell type annotation
(Fig. 1C-I, Fig. S1C, see Methods, Table S6).
We first examined how COVID-19 impacted the composition of peripheral immune cells. We
saw similar trends in immune cell composition between the three modalities, including depletion
of CD16 monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as increases in
plasmablasts in patients with severe and fatal COVID-19 (Fig. 1E; Fig. S2-3). Notably, cell
subset proportions that were altered in moderate and severe disease were generally unchanged in
mild cases, with the exception of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which were depleted in all severity
groups (Fig. 1E; Fig. S2-3). Further, a population of developing (or immature) neutrophils first
identified in our prior study of seven patients (15) was confirmed in 17 additional patients (Fig.
1G, Fig. S1C) and is similar to that observed by other groups (21).

Multimodal reference mapping enables accurate annotation and analysis of cellular subtypes
Accurate identification of fine-grained immune cell subtypes is crucial to understanding how
COVID-19 reconfigures the immune system; however, these cell types can be difficult to
identify de novo in single-cell RNA-seq data due to data sparsity and lack of information on
canonical surface marker expression in each cell. To address this, we mapped our transcriptomic
dataset to a large multimodal reference dataset introduced by Seurat v4, which incorporated
extensive surface marker information to improve cell type calls (Fig. 2A-B, Fig. S4A-B) (30).

Alignment to the Seurat v4 reference dataset revealed gene expression profiles of cell subtypes
matching their expected biological signatures (Fig. S4A-B, Tables S7-8). For example, multiple
T cell subsets, including γδ T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and regulatory
T cells (Tregs) were revealed with Seurat v4 at the expected proportions (Fig. 2B) and with the
expected transcriptomic phenotype (eg. highly-specific expression of TRDC and TRGC1 by γδ T
cells, and FOXP3 by Tregs; Fig. S4A). These annotations closely matched the manuallygenerated labels; importantly, cell types present in our dataset but absent from the reference (ie.
neutrophils) were not successfully mapped (Fig. S4C,D). To orthogonally confirm the accuracy
of these annotations, we compared the abundances of MAITs measured by CyTOF to the
proportions of MAITs in the transcriptomic dataset predicted by Seurat v4. This analysis
revealed high concordance between modalities, supporting the accuracy of these annotations
(Fig. S4E).
This strategy revealed previously unreported changes in peripheral immune cell composition in
COVID-19, including the depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T effector memory (TEM) cells and
double-negative T cells in severe and fatal COVID-19 (Fig. 2B). While DCs are known to be
depleted in COVID-19, our analysis reveals that this was due to depletion of the cDC2 subset,
while cDC1 cells were unchanged (Fig. 2B). To prioritize downstream analysis of these cell
subsets we calculated a perturbation score (30, 31) for each cell type from each COVID-19
sample relative to healthy controls (see Methods). The perturbation score for each cell type is
calculated by first identifying genes that display evidence of differential expression between
6

5

COVID-19 samples and healthy controls, calculating the difference of pseudobulk expression
vectors of these genes between COVID-19 samples and healthy controls, and finally projecting
the whole transcriptome of each donor onto this vector. This score therefore represents the
magnitude of whole transcriptome shifts in gene expression, and reveals disease severityassociated patterns in cell subtype perturbation (Fig. 2C). This perturbation score captured
phenotypic changes in major cell types like monocytes (explored further in Fig. 3) as well as
more granular subtypes like CD8 TEM cells. We focused our downstream analysis on cell
subtypes with COVID-19 severity-associated perturbation with a high number of DEGs relative
to other cell subtypes.

For example, we identified disease severity-associated phenotypes in cDC2 cells but not other
DC subsets (Fig. 2C-E). In cDC2 cells, FCER1A, known to be involved in inflammatory DC
signaling (32), CD83, an activation marker of mature DCs (33), and CTSS, which is involved in
antigen presentation (Fig. 2F) (34) were downregulated with increased disease severity while
genes associated with tolerogenic or anti-inflammatory responses, like PKM and CD163, were
upregulated (35, 36). Collectively, these results indicate that dysfunctional and antiinflammatory cDC2 cells may be a feature of severe COVID-19, with important potential
implications for Tfh development and mucosal immunity.
CD8 TEM cells also displayed severity-associated transcriptional perturbations (Fig. 2C, Fig.
S5D-E). Notably, several markers of CD8 effector capacity, like PRF1, GZMB, and CX3CR1
(37, 38), were downregulated primarily in patients with mild COVID-19 (Fig. S5F).
Additionally, in severe and fatal COVID-19 patients, CD8 TEM retained expression of markers of
effector capacity without showing features of exhaustion (Fig. S5G). Together, these data imply
that over-exuberant peripheral cytotoxic T cell responses may be associated with severe disease,
similar to previous reports (39).
We next examined the impact of disease time point on immune phenotype, given the
heterogeneity of sampling times between patients (Fig. 1B). These analyses are limited by our
small sample size of acutely infected mild patients in our transcriptional dataset. Nonetheless,
these analyses suggest that disease acuity has more impact on transcriptional perturbation in
moderate patients than in mild patients (Fig. S6): patients with a peak WHO severity score of 1-3
had similar transcriptional profiles marked by minimal perturbation, regardless of acuity status,
while those with a peak score of 4-5 appeared to cluster by acuity. These results imply that mild
COVID-19 may be marked by minimal, or rapidly resolved, systemic immune responses, a
finding that is orthogonally supported by our CyTOF analyses that include a greater number of
subjects. Cell types most perturbed in convalescence included CD8 TEM and CD14 monocytes; in
moderate patients, B cells were also perturbed in convalescence, displaying downregulation of Ig
genes (Fig. S6). Additional longitudinal sampling across all severity groups is necessary to
clarify these signatures.

Emergence of monocytes with dysfunctional features in severe COVID-19
We next analyzed the phenotypes of peripheral monocytes in COVID-19, as these cells appeared
to be strongly reconfigured in nonlinear dimensionality reduction projections for all three
modalities (Fig. 1C-D, F-I). Embedding of CD14 monocytes alone from the transcriptomic
dataset recapitulated this phenotypic shift (Fig. 3A). Similar to previous reports (11, 15, 21, 40,
41), multiple ISGs (Fig. 3B-C, Fig. S7) and markers of immature and tolerogenic monocytes,
like CD163, PLAC8, and MPO (Fig. 3B-C), were upregulated with increasing disease severity.
Notably, ARG1, encoding the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) marker and T cell
inhibitor arginase, was also upregulated most prominently in the monocytes of fatal COVID-19
patients (Fig. 3B-C). Monocytes from severe and fatal COVID-19 patients possessed additional
features of an MDSC-like phenotype, including loss of HLA class II-encoding genes (Fig. 3B-C,
Fig. S7) and enrichment of published gene signatures from MDSCs (42) and monocytes in the
setting of bacterial sepsis (43) (Fig. 3D). Additionally, we noted a severity-associated loss of
CD4 expression (Fig. 3B-C), which is involved in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and
pro-inflammatory cytokine induction in CD14 monocytes (44, 45). These results collectively
suggest that suppressive and dysfunctional monocytes are a feature of severe and fatal COVID19, in agreement with previous reports (11, 15, 21). Importantly, mild COVID-19 generally did
not lead to this shift towards suppressive and dysfunctional monocytes.
We also noted that C19orf59, which encodes MCEMP1, a key biomarker for stroke risk and
outcome (46, 47), was upregulated in the monocytes of severe and fatal COVID-19 patients (Fig.
S8). Given the accumulating data that COVID-19 can drive thrombotic complications including
ischemic stroke, we also examined expression of other transcripts reported to predict stroke risk
by Raman, et al. (47). We found that each of the five most predictive transcripts for stroke risk
and prognosis reported by Raman, et al. (C19orf59, IRAK3, ANXA3, RBM47, and TLR5) were
abundantly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, and that each of these transcripts was
significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 in either monocytes or neutrophils (Fig. S8).

40

45

We next examined the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine-encoding genes by peripheral
monocytes. Similar to previous work (11, 15), we found minimal expression of key monocytederived pro-inflammatory cytokine-encoding genes in severe and fatal COVID-19 patients; in
fact, IL1B and TNF were significantly downregulated in the monocytes of severe and fatal
COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3E-F). Similar phenotypic changes were also observed in CD16
monocytes in the scRNA-seq dataset (Fig. S7). Further, monocytes from mild COVID-19
9

patients also did not upregulate many pro-inflammatory cytokine-encoding genes (Fig. 3E-F), in
contrast to mild cases of similar viral infections like influenza (48–50).

To investigate potential gene regulatory mechanisms that could explain the downregulation of
IL1B in the CD14 monocytes of severe and fatal COVID-19 patients, we examined changes in
chromatin accessibility around the IL1B locus. We identified a putative enhancer downstream of
IL1B, which shows linkage to the IL1B promoter via single cell co-accessibility analysis and
chromosome conformation capture Hi-C data from the THP-1 monocytic cell line (Fig. 3G, see
Methods) (51). This putative enhancer showed significantly decreased accessibility in severe
COVID-19 patients (p=0.0081, Wilcoxon test, Fig. 3H). Furthermore, this element contains an
NF-κB binding motif, suggesting it may be regulated by NF-κB family transcription factors. We
identify similar changes in peaks containing NF-κB motifs at loci for other monocyte-produced
inflammatory cytokines including CCL2 and CCL3 (Fig. S9).
Consistent with this hypothesis, we further observed COVID-19-associated changes in genomewide NF-κB family transcription factor activity. Using ChromVAR analysis to quantify
transcription factor activity from the chromatin accessibility of each cell, we found increased
NF-κB activity in mild cases and significantly decreased activity in severe cases, consistent with
the changes we observed at the IL1B locus (p=0.0047, Wilcoxon test, Fig. 3I) (52). Our scRNAseq data did not show significant transcriptional changes for most NF-κB-family TFs, although
REL and RELB are significantly downregulated in severe COVID-19 (Fig. S9). This could either
reflect technical limitations of measuring lowly-expressed transcription factor transcripts, or it
could indicate that our observed NF-κB activity changes are caused by post-translational
modifications (53). The NF-κB pathway is crucial for the inflammatory responses to virus
infections in innate immune cells (53–55), and its activation relies on various proinflammatory
cytokines including IL-1β and TNFα (56). Activated NF-κB can further induce TNF and IL1B
expression (53, 57), leading to a positive feedback loop. Our results suggest that aberrant
decreases in NF-κB activity in severe COVID-19 may result in loss of accessibility at putative
enhancers of key cytokine genes, providing a potential mechanism for the previously reported
impairment in cytokine production by peripheral monocytes in COVID-19 (11).
We also examined the epigenetic regulation at the CD4 locus, as this gene was significantly
downregulated with increasing disease severity. Although there was no change in chromatin
accessibility of the CD4 gene promoter between severity groups, we found that the accessibility
of monocyte-specific CD4 gene putative regulatory regions was significantly reduced in severe
samples (Fig. S9). This monocyte-specific loss of CD4 expression may provide an additional
mechanism explaining the previously reported impairment of cytokine production by monocytes
in COVID-19 (11, 21), as the interaction between IL-16 and monocytic CD4 induces the
expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β (44).

Profiling of COVID-19 monocytes by CyTOF recapitulated many of these findings (Fig. 3J,K).
This included a loss of CD16+ monocytes as well as a distinct shift in the phenotype of CD14+
monocytes (Fig. 3J,K; Fig. S10). As observed in our transcriptional data, expression of HLADR and CD4 was lost in the CD14+ monocytes of severe COVID-19 samples. Importantly, this
proteomic reconfiguration was not observed in patients with mild COVID-19, evident in nonlinear dimensionality reduction (Fig. 3J). Mild patients experienced no significant increase in
expression of the stress marker CD112, nor did they upregulate CCR2, which is involved in
monocyte recruitment to the airways in the setting of severe COVID-19, although both of these
markers were upregulated in severe patients (Fig. 3J-L) (58, 59). They also displayed a less
dramatic loss of HLA-DR and CD4 expression compared to monocytes in severe cases (Fig. 3JL). These results indicate that while monocytes are dramatically remodeled in severe COVID-19,
mild COVID-19 has minimal, or rapidly resolved, impact on the monocyte proteome.

Peripheral NK cells are depleted in severe COVID-19 and have a highly activated phenotype
We next interrogated changes in the NK cells of COVID-19 samples. As demonstrated
previously (15, 60), peripheral NK cells were substantially depleted across all three modalities
and transcriptionally reconfigured in severe COVID-19 samples (Fig. 4A-B, Fig. S11), which
may reflect their trafficking to the site of infection. Transcriptional changes appeared to be
driven by upregulation of several canonical NK cell activation genes, including higher
12

expression of cytotoxic effector molecule-encoding genes GZMB and PRF1, as well as
proliferation marker MKI67 and ISGs like XAF1 (Fig. 4B-C). NK cells from moderate and
severe, but not mild, COVID-19 cases, also displayed transcriptional evidence of exhaustion
(Fig. 4C).

We next examined this NK cell activation signature at the protein level. We corroborate
previously known changes in NK cell biology, including increased expression of the activation
markers CD38 and CD69 (60), and also demonstrate that surface expression of the death receptor
ligand Fas-L is increased in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4D; Fig. S11). While
perforin was also upregulated in moderately and severely ill patients, surprisingly, NK cells from
fatal COVID-19 patients failed to upregulate both this cytotoxic effector and the proliferation
marker Ki-67 (Fig. 4D-E). These data, coupled with transcriptomic evidence of NK cell
exhaustion in severe and fatal COVID-19 (Fig. 4C), suggest that defects in NK cell cytotoxicity
may be associated with adverse outcomes.

Dynamic changes in NK cell receptors and ligands may underlie COVID-19 severity-associated
NK activation
To assess mechanisms of NK cell activation, we interrogated changes in the NK cell repertoire of
surface-expressed activating and inhibitory receptors as well as their cognate ligands. Notably,
surface expression of the activating receptors DNAM-1 (CD226) and NKG2D was significantly
downregulated in the activated (CD69+CD38+) (Fig. 4F) and total (Fig. S11F) NK cells of
severe COVID-19 samples compared to healthy controls, despite no change in the expression of
the genes encoding these proteins in the total NK cells within our scRNA-seq data (Fig. 4G). As
expression of both DNAM-1 and NKG2D can be downmodulated following ligation (61, 62), we
investigated the abundance of the two ligands for DNAM-1, poliovirus receptor (CD155) and
Nectin-2 (CD112), and of the ULBP proteins, which are recognized by NKG2D. Both Nectin-2
and the ULBPs were significantly upregulated on the peripheral monocytes of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Fig. 4H), which supports the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 may decrease surface expression of DNAM-1 and NKG2D through internalization
following ligation of overexpressed Nectin-2 and ULBP proteins due to stress. We found no
change in the expression of the other ligand for DNAM-1, CD155, nor did we observe any
changes in the protein- or RNA-level expression of either TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor that
competes with DNAM-1 for binding of Nectin-2, or TACTILE (CD96), which recognizes
CD155 (Fig. S11E). Alternatively, activated NK cells expressing DNAM-1 or NKG2D may
migrate to the tissue in the setting of severe disease, depleting these markers from the circulating
population.
We also investigated the surface expression levels of other ligands for NK cell receptors and
observed a loss of LLT-1 expression on CD14+ monocytes that appears to correlate with disease
severity, with a near-total loss in fatal samples (Fig. 4I); however, we found no change in the
expression of the inhibitory receptor that recognizes LLT-1, CD161, on NK cells (Fig. S11G).
The overall profile of activating and inhibitory receptors and ligands expressed in severe
COVID-19 is summarized in Fig. 4J and suggests that the activated phenotype observed in these
samples may be driven by activating signals received through DNAM-1 and NKG2D as well as a
lack of inhibitory signaling through CD161.

A hyperactivated neutrophil signature marks severe and fatal COVID-19
Despite evidence that neutrophils are major players in the dysregulated immune response
defining severe and fatal COVID-19 (16, 18–20, 63–66), there is a relative dearth of deep
profiling of neutrophils from COVID-19 patients given their sensitivity to both cryopreservation
and mechanical stimulation (67, 68). To address this, we demonstrated that Seq-Well generated
high-quality scRNA-seq data of primary human neutrophils from a healthy blood donor (Fig.
S12). While fewer genes were detected in sequenced neutrophils, the number of unique
molecular identifiers (UMIs) sequenced in neutrophils was comparable to the expected recovery
based on known RNA content (69, 70). We also found that neutrophils from ACK-lysed whole
blood were phenotypically similar to neutrophils isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting
(MACS; Fig. S12D-E); the former strategy was also able to uncover other granulocytic cell
types like eosinophils (Fig. S12C).

Seq-Well processing of red blood cell-lysed whole blood yielded 33,276 high-quality single
transcriptomes of primary neutrophils (Fig. 5A). These cells uniformly and specifically
expressed neutrophil lineage marker-encoding genes, including CSF3R and CXCR2, indicating
their identity as canonical neutrophils (Fig. 5A, Table S6). Non-linear dimensionality reduction
revealed that neutrophil transcriptional phenotype was strongly remodeled in COVID-19 (Fig.
5A), driven in part by upregulation of PADI4, which is required for NETosis, the IL-8 receptor
CXCR1, and multiple alarmins, including S100A8 and S100A9 (Fig. 5B-C), which together
induce neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion (71). We also noted disease severity-specific
induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in moderate and severe, but not in mild, COVID19 patients (Fig. 5D). While this ISG signature was detected across most cell types in moderately
and severely ill patients, neutrophils upregulated the broadest number of ISGs (Fig. S13).
Importantly, the differential expression of ISGs by neutrophils between COVID-19 severity
groups was not due to a difference in infection time point between patients: neutrophils from
patients with mild COVID-19 did not upregulate ISGs at any point during infection (Fig. 5D).
Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated upregulation of genes associated with

17

neutrophil phagocytosis and degranulation in a disease severity-associated fashion (Fig. 5E, see
Table S12).

We also identified two distinct neutrophil immunophenotypes of fatal COVID-19. Neutrophils
from 4/6 fatal COVID-19 cases had robust ISG induction and expressed CD274 (encoding PDL1; Fig. 5B-C), in line with previous work (21). However, we also identified 2 fatal COVID-19
cases with less pronounced ISG induction but with upregulation of additional neutrophil
activation markers not observed in other samples, including CXCR4, CLEC12A, EGR1, and the
decoy IL1β receptor IL1R2 (Fig. 5B-C). Additional severity-associated changes in neutrophil
phenotype included the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine-encoding genes, including
CXCL16 and TNFSF10 (encoding TRAIL), as well as upregulation of several epigenetic
regulators involved in neutrophil activation, like PADI4, which is required for formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs; Fig. 5F) (19, 72, 73).
Transcription factor activity analysis implicated STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, and IRF1 as key
upstream regulators of the observed transcriptional reconfiguration, further suggesting that
COVID-19 neutrophils are strongly activated by type I IFN in a disease severity-specific fashion
(Fig. 5G). To better contextualize these findings, we scored the neutrophils in our dataset against
gene modules upregulated in a model of endotoxemia (74) and in ARDS-complicated sepsis
(75). This analysis revealed that both of these signatures are upregulated with increasing
COVID-19 severity (Fig. 5H), implying similarities in neutrophil phenotype between these
clinical conditions. Collectively, profiling fresh whole blood rather than isolated PBMCs reveals
a prominent neutrophil hyperactivation signature in severe and fatal COVID-19.
Developing neutrophils are a feature of fatal COVID-19
We next analyzed a population of developing neutrophils from the transcriptomic dataset that
was enriched in patients with severe and fatal COVID-19 (Fig. 1E, Fig. 6A). This population has
been identified in other COVID-19 datasets but is not yet well-characterized (21, 63). These cells
specifically and highly expressed genes encoding markers expressed at distinct stages in
neutrophil development, including DEFA1B, LCN2, and MMP8 (Fig. S1C, Table S6), indicating
that they likely represent immature neutrophils derived from emergency granulopoiesis. As we
hypothesized that these cells were not a static population but rather were dynamically
differentiating, we embedded them in two and three dimensions using PHATE, a dimensionality
reduction method developed to visualize phenotypic continua, branches, and continual
progressions (Fig. 6B-C, Fig. S14) (77). Clustering of these cells revealed 5 clusters that
corresponded to sequential stages in neutrophil development, beginning with cluster 0 (proneutrophils) expressing primary neutrophil granule protein-encoding genes, followed by clusters
1-3 (pre-neutrophils) consecutively expressing secondary and tertiary neutrophil granule proteinencoding genes, and finally cluster 4 (mature neutrophils) which expresses markers of canonical
neutrophils (Fig. 6C-D) (78). Importantly, ELANE (which encodes neutrophil elastase), was
specifically expressed by pro-neutrophils, implying that these cells may be capable of NETosis
(79, 80). An orthogonal approach ordering each cell in latent time modeled by splicing kinetics
of RNA velocity (81, 82) (Fig. 6E) also revealed a similar developmental trajectory with respect
to both granule protein-encoding genes (Fig. 6F) and transcription factors known to be involved
in neutrophil development, like the C/EBP family (Fig. 6G, Fig. S14). In our earlier work, we
hypothesized that developing neutrophils may arise via transdifferentiation from plasmablasts
18

based on their phenotypic similarity in nonlinear dimensionality reduction manifold space and
subsequent analysis of cellular trajectory by RNA velocity. In this larger dataset, a phenotypic
relationship between developing neutrophils and plasmablasts was still evident (Fig. 1C-D), but
RNA velocity analysis of plasmablasts, developing neutrophils, and mature neutrophils did not
reveal a clear transdifferentiation bridge (Fig. S14). Orthogonal experiments are necessary to
conclusively determine the development origins of these cells.
As developing neutrophils were present uniformly, often at high frequencies, in patients with
fatal COVID-19, and these cells specifically expressed many genes not found in other peripheral
blood cell types, we hypothesized that the developing neutrophil gene signature might be an
accurate predictor of mortality in COVID-19. We therefore identified the five most positively
differentially-expressed genes between developing neutrophils (6,569 cells across 21 patients)
and all other cells in our dataset: DEFA1B, DEFA3, LTF, DEFA1, and S100A8. We next
obtained a publicly-available whole blood bulk transcriptomic dataset of 103 COVID-19 patients
as a validation cohort and scored each sample in this dataset by the aggregated expression of
these five genes (see Methods). After scoring each sample, we used the associated patient
metadata to determine the 28-day mortality of each scored sample. We then constructed a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot using the gene score as predictor and the 28-day
mortality as the response variable. We found that the developing neutrophil gene score
accurately predicted 28-day mortality of the 17 patients who succumbed to infection (AUC =
0.81; Fig. 6H, Fig. S14). Importantly, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at
the time of sample collection did not strongly predict 28-day mortality (AUC = 0.67), indicating
that the presence of developing neutrophils is a better prognostic indicator than current clinical
status measured by clinically used severity scales (Fig. S14). Thus, developing neutrophils are
likely enriched in the blood of fatal COVID-19 cases in other cohorts, and gene signatures from
these cells have promise as a potential prognostic indicator.
Myeloid skewing of hematopoietic progenitors in severe and fatal COVID-19
Considering that severe and fatal COVID-19 patients displayed evidence of emergency
myelopoiesis in the periphery, we hypothesized that there also may be severity-associated
aberrations in a small population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) we
identified in our transcriptomic dataset (Fig. 1C-D, Fig. 2C). Although the frequency of these
cells did not change in COVID-19 (Fig. 6I), we found that several genes involved in HSPC
maintenance and self-renewal, including CDK6, SOX4, and CHD4 (83–89), were generally
upregulated in COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls (Fig. 6J). These DEGs suggest
that the hematopoietic progenitor compartment in COVID-19 patients has been transcriptionally
reshaped to accommodate the stress of emergency hematopoiesis. To better understand the
identities of these cells, we leveraged a publicly available single-cell transcriptomic dataset of
hematopoiesis in healthy human blood and bone marrow (Fig. 6K) (90), into which we projected
HSPCs from our COVID-19 dataset (Fig. 6L). We found a trend towards myeloid skewing in
COVID-19 circulating HSPCs with increasing disease severity, with lower frequencies of
common lymphoid progenitors in severe and fatal patients, as well as granulocyte/macrophage
progenitor (GMP)/neutrophil-like cells appearing in severe and fatal cases (Fig. 6M). Together,
these results indicate severity-associated changes in hematopoiesis in COVID-19 with greater
myeloid skewing evident in circulating HSPCs.

DISCUSSION
In this work, we have compiled a trimodal single-cell atlas of immune cells from COVID-19
patients with a wide range of disease severities through scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and CyTOF.
By virtue of our whole blood analyses and multi-modal approach, our analysis reveals novel
mechanisms of immune activation and dysregulation in the setting of severe COVID-19, in
addition to providing critical validation of results from other studies. We found that neutrophils
and NK cells appeared strongly activated with increasing disease severity, with heightened ISG
induction and increased expression of cytotoxic machinery. Conversely, monocytes and dendritic
cells displayed dysregulated and tolerogenic features in severe and fatal COVID-19. Finally, we
found dramatic changes in hematopoietic development in severe COVID-19, with the appearance
of a population of developing neutrophils in the periphery and skewing of circulating
hematopoietic precursors towards the myeloid lineage.
Importantly, our profiling of patients with mild COVID-19 allows us to demonstrate that many
of these changes occur largely in severe and fatal COVID-19 and not in milder forms of the
disease. For example, the kinetics and role of local and systemic IFN signaling in ameloriating or
exacerbating SARS-CoV-2 remain controversial (41, 92–95). Here, we noted minimal induction
of ISGs in mild COVID-19 cases, regardless of the time point of infection. This suggests that
robust IFN responses detectable in the periphery may not be required for disease resolution.
Additionally, we observed surprisingly little perturbation of monocytes and NK cells from mild
COVID-19 patients, whereas mild cases of influenza are known to induce systemic activation of
these cells (96, 97). Direct comparative analyses and larger sample sizes will be necessary to
identify conserved or differential features between mild COVID-19 and other mild respiratory
virus infections.

Our analysis demonstrated a strong severity-associated hyperactivation phenotype in peripheral
neutrophils marked by broad ISG induction, pro-inflammatory cytokine-encoding gene
production, enrichment of phagocytosis and degranulation gene sets, and upregulation of
epigenetic regulators associated with inflammatory neutrophils, such as PADI4 which is required
for NETosis. Neutrophils in severe COVID-19 also strongly upregulated S100A8 and S100A9,
which dimerize to form the inflammatory molecule calprotectin, which is involved in neutrophil
activation and chemotaxis (71). Additionally, we found features associated with neutrophil
exhaustion, like upregulation of CD274, similar to other studies (21). While this finding has led
some groups to conclude that neutrophils become “suppressive” in severe COVID-19 (21), we
believe our findings, combined with accumulating evidence that NETosis contributes to tissue
injury and thrombotic complications in severe COVID-19 (16, 18, 64–66), suggest a
predominantly pathogenic role for circulating neutrophils in severe COVID-19. Importantly,
these data provide insight into the mechanistic pathways that drive neutrophil activation.
Targeting such pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities. For example, an agonist of
a neutrophil-expressed inhibitory receptor Siglec-10 (SACCOVID) has shown promising results
in suppressing hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 and is in a phase III clinical trial (98–
100). Agonists against other neutrophil-expressed inhibitory receptors, like Siglec-9, may also
represent novel therapeutic candidates (101).
In addition to identifying features of severe COVID-19, we were also able to identify key
differences between the immune responses of patients with severe COVID-19 who went on to
22

survive the disease versus those who did not. A striking difference between fatal and non-fatal
cases was the emergence of a population of developing neutrophils that was first described by
our group (15). In this earlier work we identified these cells in 4/4 patients with acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation, including in one patient who
succumbed to infection. We now show the presence of these cells in 17 additional patients,
including 5/7 patients with severe and 6/6 patients with fatal COVID-19. Our trajectory analyses
demonstrate that these cells follow the stages of canonical neutrophil development, beginning
with defensin-rich promyelocytes and differentiating through metamyelocytes and bands to form
mature neutrophils. This process may be driven by elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, like IL-17, that may induce formation of neutrophils (102). Although
any functional or pathological role for these cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unclear,
their abundance in the periphery of patients with fatal COVID-19 enabled us to demonstrate that
their most defining transcripts could be used to predict 28-day mortality in an independent bulk
transcriptomic dataset. While emergency myelopoiesis is known to be a feature of bacterial
sepsis (103, 104), it is likely that emergency myelopoiesis is also an underappreciated feature of
severe viral infection. For example, in an integrated multicohort analysis of viral disease
severity, Zheng, et al. report a gene module that includes several markers of immature
neutrophils (eg. CEACAM8, DEFA4, LCN2) that is enriched in other viral infections including
influenza and RSV (105). Additionally, a six-mRNA classifier of viral disease severity, which
includes DEFA4, trained on non-COVID-19 viral infections was found to also predict COVID19 severity (106). These results suggest that emergency myelopoiesis is a common feature of
multiple severe viral infections and may be used to predict adverse outcomes.
In addition to canonical and immature neutrophils, the phenotype of NK cells in fatal COVID-19
cases was also distinct from that of severe non-fatal cases. While circulating NK cells are known
to become activated in severe COVID-19 (60), our work is the first to show that patients with
fatal COVID-19 fail to proliferate and upregulate the cytotoxic effector perforin. The absence of
this activation could indicate a defect in the functional responses of NK cells in fatal COVID-19,
although this finding requires direct validation. We also identify NK cell ligand-receptor axes
that may contribute to their activation in severe COVID-19; for example, our data suggest that
DNAM-1-mediated recognition of Nectin-2 could drive NK cell activation in COVID-19, as
could NKG2D-mediated activation. These data are consistent with other viral infections in which
activation of NK cells through DNAM-1 or NKG2D are important (107, 108), and highlight
pathways that should be investigated through in vivo model systems for their role in disease
outcome.
While neutrophils and NK cells are activated in COVID-19, monocytes and dendritic cells
appear to take on an impaired inflammatory phenotype. Perturbations in the cDC2 dendritic cells
of patients with severe COVID-19 could inhibit priming of Tfh cells and development of
mucosal immunity (109). Both cDC2s and monocytes of critically ill COVID-19 patients
appeared to downregulate or failed to upregulate genes involved in activation and inflammation;
for example, cDC2s lost expression of FCER1A and CD83, while CD14+ monocytes notably did
not upregulate any genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and CCL3, and
genes encoding IL-1β and TNF were significantly downregulated in these cells compared to
healthy controls. This lack of proinflammatory cytokine expression is of note as other viral
infections such as influenza drive an increase in the production of these molecules by peripheral
23

5

monocytes (97). We identified the inactivation of NF-κB family TFs as a possible epigenetic
mechanism for this silencing of proinflammatory cytokine production in monocytes, as we
observed a striking loss of accessibility at an NF-κB binding site within the IL1B locus. This
observed inactivation is unusual, given that these TFs typically play an important role in antiviral
immune responses, including through regulating the production of cytokines (110). Indeed, NFκB family TFs have been implicated in driving the proinflammatory cytokine production in other
cell types during SARS-CoV-2 infection (111). It is also possible that the absence of NF-κB
activity and accessibility at cytokine-encoding genes reflects the immaturity of monocytes in
severe COVID-19.

There are several limitations to this work that should be noted. Though large for a multi-modal
dataset, our sample size is still limited. Moreover, we were unable to profile each patient by all
three single-cell modalities, preventing us from performing cross-modality validation on a perpatient basis. Additionally, our CyTOF panels only allowed us to examine a limited number of
cell types, preventing us from performing orthogonal validation of some transcriptional or
epigenetic findings in proteomic space. This work profiled exclusively circulating immune cells;
while understanding the peripheral immune system is critical to understanding aberrant and
protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it does not capture the immune response
at the site of infection. Finally, further functional experimentation is necessary to validate or
refute many of the hypotheses presented here.
Collectively, our work represents the first trimodal epigenomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic
cell atlas of peripheral immune responses to COVID-19 across a broad spectrum of disease
severity. By identifying novel immune features associated with COVID-19 mortality, as well as
the immune status of patients with mild disease, our work enhances our understanding of
pathological vs. protective immune responses and highlights several opportunities for therapeutic
development.
