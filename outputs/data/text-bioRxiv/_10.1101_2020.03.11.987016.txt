Abstract
Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking host
inflammation and MERS-CoV replication, were screened from a chemical library. Within this
library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in
cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus.
The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)
replication (EC90) was 6.3 μM. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the
presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino
acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse
genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide
suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide
was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients
suffering MERS or COVID-19.

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak began on December 2019 in Wuhan, China (1), and the causative
virus, SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread into 43 countries as of February 27, 2020. The
number of infected patients exceeds 81,000, and the death toll exceeds 2,700. Several
drugs, including lopinavir, remdesivir, and chloroquine, have been reported to be
presumably effective in treating this disease (2, 3).
Systemic treatment with corticosteroids is contraindicated for the severe pneumonia caused
by viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as steroids suppress the innate immune
system, resulting in increased viral replication. In fact, for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2013,
treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased mortality (4, 5). In the present
study, we reconsider the use of inhaled corticosteroids, which have been excluded from the
treatment of pneumonia caused by coronavirus.

Results and Discussion
Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking both coronavirus
replication and host inflammation, were screened from a chemical library. The cytopathic
effect caused by MERS-CoV infection was measured to evaluate viral replication. Four
steroid compounds, ciclesonide, mometasone furoate, mifepristone, and algestone
acetophenide conferred a greater than 95% cell survival rate (Fig. S1).

Next, concentration-dependent viral growth suppression and drug cytotoxicity were
assessed. Ciclesonide exhibited low cytotoxicity and potent suppression of viral growth (Fig.
1a). Cortisone and prednisolone, which are commonly used for systemic steroid treatment,
dexamethasone, which has strong immunosuppressant effects, and fluticasone, a
commonly used inhaled steroid, did not suppress viral growth (Fig. 1a).

The antiviral effects of steroids against various species of viruses were tested by quantifying
propagated virus in culture medium. Ciclesonide and mometasone also suppressed
replication of other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV, but not replication of RS
virus or influenza virus (Fig. S2). In addition, ciclesonide slightly but significantly inhibited
rubella virus (having positive strand RNA genome) replication (Fig. S2), suggesting that
ciclesonide interacted with the replication site of positive-strand RNA virus intracellularly.

To identify the drug target of virus replication, we conducted 11 consecutive MERS-CoV
passages in the presence of 40 μM ciclesonide or 40 μM mometasone. A mutant virus that
developed resistance ciclesonide was generated (Fig. 1b), but no resistant virus to

mometasone was generated. Next-generation sequencing identified that an amino acid
substitution at A25V (C19647T in the reference sequence NC_019843.3) in nonstructural
protein 15 (NSP15), coronavirus endoribonuclease (6–8), was the predicted mechanism for
viral resistance to ciclesonide. A recombinant virus carrying the A25V amino acid
substitution (Re-Nsp15-A25V) was generated from the parental MERS-CoV/EMC strain
(Re-EMC/MERS) with a BAC reverse genetics system (9), which overcame the antiviral
effect of ciclesonide (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the mutant virus was inhibited by mometasone,
suggesting that the antiviral target of mometasone was different from that of ciclesonide.

Next, the effect of ciclesonide on SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated. VeroE6/TMPRSS2
cells(10) were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of steroids or other
inhibitors. At 6 h post-infection, cellular RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR was
conducted to quantify the amount of viral RNA (11). Ciclesonide and mometasone
suppressed viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir (Fig. 2a). For comparison, viral
cell entry inhibitors were tested. E64d substantially reduced viral RNA levels, but nafamostat
and camostat had only modest antiviral effects, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 primarily
utilized the cathepsin/endosomal pathway of cell entry rather than the TMPRSS2/cell
surface pathway to enter TMPRSS2-expressing cells, consistent with a recent study (12).
Ciclesonide blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication at low concentrations (EC50 =4.4μM;

EC 90=6.3μM; CC50>100μM) (Fig. 2b).

This study suggests that ciclesonide presumably interacts with viral NSP15, either directly or
indirectly, to suppress viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. An amino acid substitution in the
ciclesonide-resistant mutant, located at the dimerization site of the NSP15 homo-hexamer
(12), suggested that ciclesonide interacts with NSP15 during viral biogenesis. Future studies
will provide a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of ciclesonide suppression of
viral replication.

Ciclesonide is a safe drug, and can be administered to infants at high concentrations.
Inhaled ciclesonide is expected to reduce viral replication and host inflammation in the lungs,
with decreased immunosuppressive effects compared to systemic corticosteroids, as
ciclesonide primarily remains in the lung tissue, and does not significantly enter the
bloodstream. Treatment of patients with ciclesonide should be carefully evaluated,
considering the benefit-risk balance of the drug.

Cells and viruses. Vero cells and VeroE6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 (VeroE6/TMPRSS2)
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL, USA). MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
were propagated in Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.

Steroids and inhibitors. The following compounds were used: cortisone, prednisolone,
fluticasone, dexamethasone, algestone acetophenide, mifepristone, mometasone furoate,
and ciclesonide (from Prestwick the Chemical Library ;PerkinElmer, MA, USA), nafamostat
(N0289; Sigma), camostat (3193; Tocris Bioscience, USA), E64d (330005; Calbiochem,
USA), and lopinavir (SML1222; Sigma).

Quantification of coronaviral RNA. Confluent cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with
virus in the presence of steroid compounds. Cellular RNA was isolated at 6 hours
post-infection (hpi) using a CellAmp Direct RNA Prep Kit (3732; Takara, Japan) and culture
medium collected at 24 hpi or 27 hpi was diluted 10-fold in water, then boiled. A real-time
PCR assay was performed to quantify the amount of coronavirus RNA with a MyGo Pro
instrument (IT-IS Life Science, Ireland) using primers and probes described previously (11,
13).

Cytotoxicity Assays. Confluent cells in 96-well plates were treated with steroids. After
incubation for 24 or 27 hours, a cell viability assay was performed using WST reagent
(CK12; Dojin Lab, Japan) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Generation of recombinant MERS-CoV from BAC plasmids. A bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) clone carrying the full-length infectious genome of the MERS-CoV
EMC2012 strain was used to generate recombinant MERS-CoV, as described previously
(9).

Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed using an ANOVA test. A P-value
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In figures, significance is indicated as follows:
n.s., not significant; * P ≤ 0.05; ** P ≤ 0.01; and *** P ≤ 0.001. Error bars indicate standard
deviations (SD).
