ABSTRACT
The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person
transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to
systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host
proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19
derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact
with NKRF, a NF-kB repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and
overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only
presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to
reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine
storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.

MAIN TEXT
In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2, previously known
by the provisional name “2019 novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV) given by the World Health Organization (WHO)],
was first isolated from a cluster of patients with pneumonia. This novel strain of coronavirus has been identified
as the causative agent for the epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome [also referred to as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in Wuhan, China1–3. Since then, the COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly swept all the
provinces of China and has disseminated globally to 202 countries and territories through traveling4. On 31
January 2020, the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern5. As of 27
March 2020, the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has caused 512,701 confirmed infection cases including
23,495 deaths in 202 countries and territories, calling for extended efforts to understand the molecular drivers of
its immune evasion and pathogenesis.
COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate mortality rate (2-5%) and is primarily
transmitted through droplet and direct contact with infected persons or incubation carriers6. SARS-CoV-2 has a
preferential tropism for airway epithelial cells mediated through the accessibility of ACE2 receptor7–10. The
common clinical manifestations of fever and cough in conjunction with laboratory results of progressively
increasing neutrophil counts and leukocytopenia in serum samples taken from COVID-19 patients at various
stages of the illness indicates uncontrolled neutrophil extravasation and activation11,12. Neutrophils are the most
abundant type of white blood cells in human blood and serve as the first responders in the line of defense against
acute infection. Chemical signals such as Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6 stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis and
recruitment to the site of infection where they congregate and cause the release of more proinflammatory
mediators that in turn activate additional inflammatory signals, leading to cytokine storms that may progress to
vital organ failure13. Indeed, a large number of macrophages and neutrophils were found in alveolar cavities in
COVID-19 fatal patients14, suggesting their roles for cytokine storms. While uncontrolled neutrophil activity and
aberrant cytokine response contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in COVID-19, how SARS-CoV-2 causes
these immunological changes, especially the enhancement of neutrophil chemotaxis and activation remains
largely undetermined.
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus and belongs to the b-coronavirus family
consisting of many animal species and human pathogens including SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. The ~30 kb non-segmented genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes 14 major open reading
frames (ORFs), which are further processed into 4 structural proteins [glycoprotein spike (S), membrane (M),
envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)], 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16), and at least 8 accessory
proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9a, ORF9b, and ORF10)15. Similar to SARS-CoV, spike

protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with human ACE2 expressed on human airway epithelia to facilitate
virus entry7–10. However, host targets for other viral proteins remain largely unknown, which limits our
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion and pathogenesis, further impeding anti-viral drug development
and design of therapeutic approaches.

Genome-wide screens for SARS-CoV-2 intra-viral protein-protein interactions
Limited by their relatively small genomes, viral proteins form different combinations of protein complexes
to fulfill a variety of critical functions during viral life cycle, making the investigation of intra-viral protein-protein
interactions (PPIs) a requirement. To systematically characterize the intra-viral PPI networks, both genome-wide
yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screens and co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP) experiments with SARS-CoV-2 genes were
performed. All the predicted viral genes were synthesized based on the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate
(GenBank: MN908947). The entire library was cloned into Y2H DNA-binding domain (pACT2) and activation
domain (pGBTK7) vectors and then transformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain (Clontech). Nsp3 was truncated
into two smaller fragments in this experiment since large genes tend to yield fewer interactions in the Y2H assay.
All the possible pair-wise combinations were examined independently for the activation of the reporter genes
HIS3 and ADE2 in triplicates. We captured 19 PPIs from the Y2H screens, including nsp15-nsp2, ORF7b-nsp1,
N-nsp4, ORF3a-nsp4, ORF7b-nsp7, nsp7-nsp8, nsp12-nsp8, nsp7-nsp9, nsp14-nsp10, nsp16-nsp10, ORF6nsp14, E-E, N-E, ORF3a-E, ORF9b-E, N-N, nsp7-ORF7a, nsp8-ORF8, and ORF9b-ORF9b (Extended Data
Fig.1). The Co-IP assay resulted in the identification of 52 PPIs (Extended Data Fig.1-2). Some of the
interactions between viral proteins, such as the association between nsp12 and nsp8, were detected by both
Y2H and co-IP. Some viral proteins, such as M, N, E, nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF9b, and
ORF10 displayed self-association, suggesting their dimer or oligomer forms may carry out important functions
during infection. In total, we characterized 58 distinct intra-viral PPIs amongst 28 SARS-CoV-2 genes that may
promote virus replication and can be expected to be important to immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.
(Fig.1a).
Among the 4 classical structural proteins, 3 PPIs were detected (Fig.1b); these interactions of structural
proteins may be critical in the organization of viral particles during viral replication and assembly. We also found
8 PPIs between structural proteins and accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF9b, and
ORF10) and 6 PPIs between structural proteins and non-structural proteins (nsp2, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8, and nsp16)
(Fig. 1b), These PPI may play a pivotal role in viral structural protein processing, modification, and trafficking,
supporting their importance for viral particle assembly and egress.
While structural proteins are components for the capsid and the envelope of the virus, several nonstructural proteins (nsps), such as nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 have associated enzymatic activities
essential for viral RNA replication and viral protein translation. In addition, nsps can function as virulence factors
that inhibit the host’s immune system defenses. We speculate that the relatively large number of nsp interactions
detected (12) might imply a crucial role of nsps in the formation of multimeric complexes during the viral life cycle
(Fig.1c). The SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab (the precursor of all 16 nsps) shares 94.4% amino acid identity to SARSCoV ORF1ab. A number of structural studies posits the methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 or nsp16
are facilitated by nsp10-nsp14 and nsp10-nsp16 associations, respectively16,17, which are also observed in
SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our intra-viral PPI network provides the foundation to dissect the role of these viral proteins
in mediating the synthesis, assembly and processing of viral proteins for both SARS-CoV-2 and the closely
related SARS-CoV. Disruption of these intra-viral PPIs by repurposing small molecule or peptide drugs that target
specific epitopes can be a treatment strategy against COVID-1918.

Genome-wide proteomic screen for SARS-CoV-2 viral-host protein-protein interactions

To better understand the roles of these viral proteins during the virus life cycle, it is pivotal to establish
the SARS-CoV-2-host interactome in human cells. We overexpressed the plasmids encoding each SARS-CoV2 encoded gene with N-terminal 3xFlag-epitope in HEK293 cells and purified each SARS-CoV-2 protein complex
by affinity purification. Co-purified cellular proteins were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography and
tandem mass spectrometry (AP-LC-MS). From AP-LC-MS analysis, 251 cellular proteins were identified to
interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, resulting in 631 high-confidence interactions (Fig.2 and Table 1). We
identified previously reported proteins that had bona fide associations with SARS-CoV proteins, such as ROA0
and subunits of the ATPase (AT1A1 and AT1A2)19, further substantiating these cellular processes as vital targets
of the coronavirus family. SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins also interacts with the subunits of 40S ribosomal proteins
(RS5, RS10, RS12, RS14, RS17, RS18, and RS27), T complex proteins (TCPA, TCPD, TCPE, TCPG, TCPH,
TCPQ, and TCPZ), and proteasome-related proteins (PRS4, PRS7, PRS8, PSA, PSA4, PSA6, PSA7, PSD11,
PSD13, PSMD1, PSMD2, PSMD6, and PSMD7). These viral-cellular protein interactions might have extensive
cytopathic effects on the host cell, often altering host gene translation, protein folding, and degradation pathways
during viral infection to assist viral growth and proliferation (Extended Data Fig.3a-b). The virus may also coopt the complex membranous network surrounding and residing within the host cell, such as the endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membranes, so long as the membrane systems possess host proteins
that lead to a productive infection (Fig.2). Most importantly, the AP-LC-MS analysis uncovered host targets
pertinent in inflammatory and innate immune responses, which may help explain the common respiratory
symptoms. Key viral-cellular PPIs that may influence the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 include interaction
between NKRF (an endogenous repressor of IL-8/IL-6 synthesis) and nsp9/nsp10/nsp12/nsp13/nsp1520,21,
C1QBP (involved in complement C1 activation) and nsp9/nsp1022, G3BP2 (anti-viral stress granule protein) and
N23, and RAE1 (an interferon-inducible mRNA nuclear export protein) and ORF624. These observations provide
an overview of host proteins or pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and these PPIs might
serve as potential targets for drug development or repurposing against COVID-19.

Global proteome profiling of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients
To elucidate the mechanism and effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, we determined the global
proteome profile changes in PBMCs samples taken from healthy donors compared with PBMCs collected from
COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms. The PBMC samples were obtained from the Shanghai Public
Health Clinical Center and includes 6 healthy donors, 22 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms (COVID-19MS), and 13 COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms (COVID-19-SS) (Extended Data Fig.4). PBMCs were
harvested from the leftover blood samples and all the patients were confirmed negative for influenza A virus.
Following the Guideline of Novel Coronavirus Laboratory Safety (Edition 2), PBMCs were collected, lysed in
denaturing buffer (see Methods) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and sent for proteome analysis
at the National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai.
A total of 6,739 proteins were identified in our study, of which 4,274 proteins could be quantified in all 26
PMBCs samples. Proteins with less than three quantitation values did not pass filtering threshold and were
excluded from the quantitation and statistical analysis. 5,522 proteins were quantified according to criteria and
included in global proteomic profiling to reveal a list of 220 proteins found to be differentially expressed [|log2
(fold change)| ≥ 1, n≥3] in the PBMCs of COVID-19-MS compared with that of healthy donors: 115 proteins
showed a statistically significant increase while 105 proteins showed reduction in expression when comparing
COVID-19-MS with control. (Fig.3a, Extended Data Fig.5a-b and Table 2). Functional analysis by DAVID and
Cluster Profiler revealed that these genes were enriched in specific cellular biological processes, including
positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil activation, type I interferon signaling pathway,
inflammatory response, and antigen processing and presentation (Fig.3b and Extended Data Fig.5c-d),
suggesting an active innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of the global proteomic
changes reveal significant upregulation of CXCR2, PRG3, LBP, MMP25, CRP, NLRP1 in the COVID-19-MS

PBMC cohort (Fig.3c). CXCR2 is a subunit of IL-8 receptor and facilitates IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis
while PRG3 has been reported to stimulate neutrophil superoxide production and IL-8 release25,26. LBP positively
regulates neutrophil response upon LPS stimulation and MMP25 inactivates alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor to
facilitate the trans-endothelial migration of neutrophil to inflammatory sites during infection27,28. These
differentially expressed proteins support a model by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine release, such as IL-8,
in the early stage of infection, resulting in uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils to the sites of
infection followed by eventual progression to cytokine storm and respiratory distress. Indeed, laboratory results
reveal increased neutrophils to ~90% of the white blood cell count as COVID-19 progresses to critical stages11,12.
The elevation of IL-8 and IL-6 but not IL-17 in PMBCs collected from COVID-19 patients indicates possible roles
for IL-8/IL-6 in the severe inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3d-e and Extended Data Fig.5e).
Next, we compared the proteome change between PBMCs isolated from COVID-19-SS and COVID-19MS patients. Amongst 6,235 quantified proteins (n≥3), 553 proteins were found to be significantly differentially
expressed [|log2 (fold change)| ≥ 1, adjusted two-sided p Value ≤0.05] between COVID-19SS and COVID-19
MS’s PMBCs. 27 of these proteins were upregulated and 526 of these proteins were downregulated in COVID19-SS as compared to COVID-19-MS (Fig.3f, Extended Data Fig.6a-b and Table 3). Functional analysis by
DAVID and Cluster Profiler revealed that these genes are highly enriched in pathways associated with regulation
of immune response, T cell co-stimulation and activation, complement activation, B cell receptor signaling
pathway, and T cell receptor signaling (Fig.3g and Extended Data Fig.6c-d). The expressions of T cell receptor
(TCR) subunits (CD3e, CD3g, CD247, TRAC, and TRBC1), T cell surface molecules (CD4, CD8a, CD8b, and
CD2), MHC class II molecules (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4, and HLA-DRB5), T cell migration stimulators
(DDP4), and TCR signaling kinases (ZAP70, LCK, and FYN) were dramatically diminished in COVID-19-SS as
compared to COVID-19-MS (Fig.3a,h), suggesting a failure of T cells activation and function. The expressions
of immunoglobulin subunits (IGHG1, IGHG2, IGHG4, IGLC2, IGLL1, and IGHE) were also significant lower in
COVID-19-SS (Fig.3a,h), indicating reduced antibody secretion by B cells. These results demonstrated that
more severe COVID-19 patients undergo a functional decline in adaptive immunity, which is correlated with their
lower T cell and B cell populations11,12.

SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 and nsp10 target NKRF to facilitate IL-8/IL-6 production
From the quantitative proteome analysis of PBMCs, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-8/IL-6
expression and increases neutrophil count which may mediate the manifestation of acute respiratory distress
syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 virulence factors may potentiate
or regulate the induction of IL-8/IL-6 during infection, leading to the uncontrolled infiltration and activation of
neutrophils. NKRF is a transcriptional repressor that inhibit IL-8 and IL-6 induction by competing with NF-kB for
promoter binding20,21,29. From our virus-host interactome, we discovered that NKRF interacts with SARS-CoV-2
nsp9, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 (Fig.2 and Extended Data Fig.7a). Among these SARS-CoV-2 viral
proteins, individually expressed nsp9 or nsp10 facilitated the induction of both IL-8 and IL-6 in lung epithelial
A549 cells, while individually expressed nsp12, nsp13, or nsp15 had little or no effects (Fig. 3i-j). The levels of
TNFa was not affected by either nsp9 or nsp10 (Extended Data Fig.7b), suggesting nsp9 and nsp10 does not
affect NK-kB signaling transduction overall. Importantly, NKRF deficiency by specific siRNA facilitated the
induction of IL-8 and diminished the effect of nsp10, indicating that nsp10 potentially targeted NKRF to regulate
IL-8 induction (Extended Data Fig.7c-d).
Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has underwent rapid adaptive changes against evolutionary
pressures since its isolation30. Phylogenetic and genetic analysis31 of 160 public SARS-CoV-2 sequences
reveals 137 amino acid substitutions in 23 viral proteins with no mutations occurring in nsp9 (Extended Data
Fig.7e and Table 4), which indicates nsp9 has remained relatively stable. Unlike nsp9, nsp10 picked up only
two amino acid substitutions (A61G and F68L), but with very low variation rate (1/160 for each site) during

evolution (Extended Data Fig.7f), indicating that nsp9 and nsp10 are potential stable targets to curb SARSCoV-2-mediated IL-8/IL-6 activation and subsequently recruitment of neutrophils.
Our study integrated virus-host interaction network and quantitative proteome approaches to identify host
targets of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 evolved multiple mechanisms to
modulate host fundamental cellular processes, which ultimately contributes to its immune evasion and
pathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the PBMC proteome profile in both mild
and severe cases of COVID-19, corroborating the overall clinical features of COVID-19 patients at molecular
levels. These systematic analyses not only generate groundwork for future SARS-CoV-2 research on the nature
of this virus but also provide valuable targets for specific drug development or repurposing. With these platforms,
we identified nsp9 and nsp10 as the potential virulence factors for SARS-CoV-2, which interacts with NKRF to
facilitate IL-8/IL-6 induction, ultimately leading to uncontrolled infiltration and activation of neutrophils (Fig.4).
Specific agents targeting IL-8/IL-6 or the downstream JAK kinases could be repurposed as suitable drug
candidates for clinical evaluation. These small molecule inhibitors (i.e. IL-6 or IL-8 receptor antagonists) or
agents blocking virulence factor PPIs would have enormous value as anti-virulence therapies in the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 infections (Fig.4).

METHODS
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (#YJ-2020S052-02). The proteomic analysis of PBMC samples were performed on existing samples collected during
standard diagnostic tests, posing no extra burden to patients.

Cell lines, plasmids, and antibodies
HEK293 and A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco-BRL)
containing 4 mM glutamine and 10% FBS. Vero cells were cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS and 4 mM glutamine.
Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #3000015). SARSCoV-2 genes were synthesized as DNA fragments (Sangon Biotech) and these expression constructs were
amplified by PCR and cloned into pLVX-3xFlag-MCS-P2A-tagRFP (puro), pEF-MCS-3xHA, pGBTK7, or pACT2
vectors. Mutations of nsp10 were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All
constructs were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer to verify 100% correspondence
with the original sequence. Primary antibodies were purchased from the following venters: mouse anti-Flag

Purification of ZIKV viral protein complexes
HEK293 were transfected with 3xFlag-tagged plasmids encoding each SARS-CoV-2 protein by
Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #L3000015). 3x107 HEK293 cells were harvested in 10 ml lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, phosphatase inhibitors and
protease inhibitors) at 72 h post transfection, followed by centrifugation and filtration (0.45 μm) to remove debris.
Cell lysates were precleared with 100 μl protein A/G resin, and then incubated with 25 μl anti-Flag M2 resin
(Sigma, #F2426) for 12 h at 4°C on a rotator. The resin was washed 5 times and transferred to a spin column
with 40 μl of 3 X Flag peptide (Sigma, #F4799) for 1 h at 4°C on a rotator. The purified complexes were sent for
mass spectrometry analysis for protein-protein interaction network at the National Facility for Protein Science in
Shanghai.

Virus-host Interaction network analysis
The samples (purified complexes) were precipitated by TCA and resolved in 8 M urea, and then treated
with 5 mM TCEP and 10 mM IAA to reduce the disulfide bonds and alkylate the resulting thiol groups, sequentially.
The mixture was digested for 16 h at 37 °C by trypsin at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (wt/wt). The trypsindigested peptides were desalted by monospin C18 and loaded on a home-made 40 cm-long pulled-tip analytical
column (75 μm ID x 360μm OD, ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin, Dr. Maisch GmbH), connected to a Thermo
Easy-nLC1000 HPLC system. The samples were analyzed with a 120 min-HPLC gradient from 0 to 100% of
buffer B (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water; buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) at 300 nL/min：4-8
min, 0%-4% B;1-96 min, 8-35% B; 97-104min, 35-60% B; 104-105min, 60-100% B; 105-120min, 100% B. The
eluted peptides were ionized and directly introduced into a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer using a nano-spray
source with a distal 2.0-kV spray voltage. Survey full-scan MS spectra (from m/z 300–1,800) was acquired in the
Orbitrap analyzer with resolution r = 70,000 at m/z 200. One acquisition cycle includes one full-scan MS spectrum
followed by top 20 MS/MS events, sequentially generated on the first to the twentieth most intense ions selected
from the full MS spectrum at a 28% normalized collision energy. The acquired MS/MS data were analyzed
against a UniProtKB Human database (database released on Sept. 30, 2018) containing SARS-CoV-2 viral
proteins using Maxquant V1.6.10.43. In order to accurately estimate peptide probabilities and false discovery
rates (FDR), we used a decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the proteins appended to the

target database. FDR was set at 0.01. Mass tolerance for precursor ions was set at 20 ppm. Trypsin was defined
as cleavage enzyme and the maximal number of missed cleavage sites was set at 3. Carbamidomethylation
(+57.02146) of cysteine was considered as a static modification. Methionine oxidation was set as variable
modifications.

Proteomic study of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients
Preparation of PMBC cells from patients: The information of 35 patients (13 COVID-19 patients with
severe symptoms and 22 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 6
health donors as control was listed in Extended Data Fig.4, including age (47-73), sex, and symptoms. This
study followed the Guideline of Novel Coronavirus Laboratory Safety (Edition 2) and was approved by Shanghai
Public Health Clinical Center (#YJ-2020-S052-02). The peripheral venous whole blood samples were collected
from all the patients and PBMCs were prepared using density-gradient centrifugation followed by washing with
cold PBS twice. The cell pellets were lysed by 8 Urea (in 20mM Tris-HCl with protein inhibitor cocktail and
phosphor-STOP cocktail, pH 8.0) to denature the proteins and sonicated twice on ice to break the protein-protein
or DNA-protein interactions. All the procedures were carried out within the certified laboratory for studies of
infectious materials. Then protein samples were combined to generate 3 control samples from 6 healthy donors,
13 mild-case samples from 22 COVID-19-MS and 10 severe-case samples from 13 COVID-19-SS according to
the protein concentrations of all the samples. The resulted protein soups were then applied for protein digestion
for the following proteomic experiments.
Protein Digestion: TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, final concentration is 5 mM) (Thermo
Scientific) and iodoacetamide (final concentration is 10mM) (Sigma) for reduction and alkylation were added to
the solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, respectively. The protein mixture was diluted
four times and digested with LysC at 1:50(w/w) for four hours and then with Trypsin at 1:40 (w/w) (Promega,
http://www.promega.com/) overnight.
TMT labeling: The concentrations of the peptide soups were measured with Quantitative Colorimetric
Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). TMT10plex amino reactive reagents (0.8 mg per vial, Thermo Scientific) were
suspended in 41 μl of anhydrous acetonitrile and added to peptide soups (100 μg peptides in total). Reactions
were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 hr, and then quenched by the addition of 8 μl of 5%
hydroxylamine for 15 min. The TMT-labeled samples were pooled at a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. The mixture was
vacuum centrifuged to near dryness and desalted on a MonoSpinTM C18 (GL Science).
Off-line high pH-reversed phase fractionation: The desalted TMT-labeled peptides were resuspended
in 300 ul 10% buffer C (50 mM ammonium hydroxide, pH 10). Off-line fractionations were performed using a
Agilent 1260 HPLC with a 4.6 mm × 250 mm BEH C18, 3.5 μm column (Waters) by a 58 min gradient from 5%
to 80% buffer B (100% acetonitrile) with buffer A (100% water) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min while buffer C was
running constantly at 10% of total flow rate during the process. Fractions were collected over 75 min at 1 min
intervals after the start of the gradient in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. The peptide mixture was fractionated into a
total of 50 fractions which were consolidated into 18 vials. Samples were subsequently desalted and vacuum
centrifuged to near dryness. The desalted peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% fomic acid for downstream LCMS/MS analysis.
LC-MS/MS analysis of peptides: For proteome study, all the 18 fractions for each TMT experiment were
analyzed by a home-made 40 cm-long pulled-tip analytical column (75 μm ID x 360μm OD, ReproSil-Pur C18AQ 1.9 μm resin, Dr. Maisch GmbH), the column was then placed in-line with an Easy-nLC 1200 nano HPLC
(Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) for mass spectrometry analysis. The analytical column temperature was set
at 55 ℃ during the experiments. The mobile phase and elution gradient used for peptide separation were as
follows: 0.1% formic acid in water as buffer A and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile as buffer B, 0-1 min, 5%10% B; 1-96 min, 10-30% B; 96-104 min, 30%-50% B, 104-105 min, 50%-100% B, 105-120 min, 100% B. The

flow rate was set at 300 nL/min. Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was performed
with a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptides eluted from the LC
column were directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer with the application of a distal 2.2-kV spray
voltage. A cycle of one full-scan MS spectrum (m/z 300-1800) was acquired followed by top 20 MS/MS events
(first mass fixed at 100 m/z scan range), sequentially generated on the first to the twentieth most intense ions
selected from the full MS spectrum at a 35% normalized collision energy. Full scan resolution was set to 70,000
with automated gain control (AGC) target of 3e6. MS/MS scan resolution was set to 35,000 with isolation window
of 1.8 m/z and AGC target of 1e5. The number of microscans was one for both MS and MS/MS scans and the
maximum ion injection time was 50 and 100 ms, respectively. The dynamic exclusion settings used were as
follows: charge exclusion, 1 and >8; exclude isotopes, on; and exclusion duration, 30 seconds.
Data Analysis: The acquired MS/MS data were analyzed against a UniProtKB human (database
released on Sept. 30, 2018) by Maxquant V1.6.10.43. Tolerance of precursor mass and fragment mass were set
to ±20ppm. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021 Da), TMT-labeled N-terminus and lysine (+229.163 Da)
were set as static modifications. Oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da) was set as variable modification. All
identified proteins had a FDR ≤1%, which was calculated at the peptide level.
Merging of datasets and statistical analysis: The interpretation of three sets of proteomic results
(protein Groups.txt) from MaxQuant were done in the Perseus software environment (version 1.6.2.3) and
Python3. Briefly, the datasets were merged by matching the protein accession numbers of each individual
dataset for combination by Python in-house developed scripts (comparepg.py). And the protein abundances
were normalized by the TMT-labeled internal standard samples which were consisted of an aliquot of each
sample and spiked into the 3 sets of TMT labeling experiments. All the normalized reporter ion abundances of
biological repeats were averaged for fold-change calculation. For AP-MS analysis, a two-sided two sample t-test
was used to obtain the statistical significance to compare the results of the two groups. For proteome analysis,
p value was calculated by empirical Bayes moderated t-tests and then adjusted by Benjamini and Hochberg
method, using limma package32 built in R environment. Proteins were required to have a |log2(fold change)|≥1
and adj. p value cut-off of 0.05 to be considered as being significantly differentially expressed. Gene ontology
(GO) analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and
ClusterProfiler v3.14.333.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 intra-viral PPIs by yeast-two-hybrid
28 SAR-CoV-2 genes were cloned into both pGBTK7 (bait) and pACT2 (prey) vectors. The reporter
Y2HGold yeast strain (Clontech) was co-transformed with different bait-prey combinations as indicated in
Extended Data Fig.1 in accordance with instructions for Matchmaker GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech).
The transformed yeast was then screened in 4-dropout plates for the protein-protein interaction.

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, #74106) and treated with RNasefree DNase according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All gene transcripts were quantified by quantitative PCR
using qScriptTM One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Quanta Biosciences, #95057-050) on CFX96 real-time PCR system
(Bio-Rad). Primer sequences for qPCR were as follow: IL-6 forward: AACCTGAACCTTCCAAAGATGG, IL-6

siRNA gene silencing
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human NKRF (#A10001) and negative control siRNAs were
purchased from GenePharma. siRNAs were delivered to the A549 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #13778030) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
48 h of transfection, cells were verified for target gene knock-down by quantitative RT-PCR.

Phylogenetic and genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
160 SARS-CoV-2 isolates with complete genome sequences from 18 different countries during December
23, 2019 to February 29, 2020 were used for molecular evolutionary analysis in this study. Multiple alignment
was performed by Clustal W and phylogenetic tree was constructed by Neighbor-Joining statistical method based
on the Maximum Composite Likelihood model with 500 replicates of bootstrap testing using MEGA31.

Quantification and Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as Mean ± SD as indicated. For parametric analysis, the F test was used to
determine the equality of variances between the groups compared; statistical significance across two groups
was tested by Student’s t-test; one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test
were used to determine statistically significant differences between multiple groups. P-values of less than 0.05
were considered significant.
