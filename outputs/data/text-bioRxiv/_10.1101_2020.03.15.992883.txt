SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease—COVID-19—
within several months of its initial identification. Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel
coronavirus’s surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus,
is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on
the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2
S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 Å. We identified a set of
SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other
betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with
antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We
determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly
reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the
“closed” prefusion S structure, but is accessible in “open” conformations. This first-ever resolution of a
human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a
conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a
framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and
related betacoronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 marks the seventh coronavirus to be isolated from humans, and
the third to cause a severe disease—named COVID-19—after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)(Munster et al., 2020). The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2,
and the grave risk it poses to global health, prompted the World Health Organization to declare, on 30
January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern and on 11
March 2020 to be a pandemic(Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). As of 13 March 2020, there have been
nearly 140000 SARS-CoV-2 infections and more than 5000 associated deaths reported across at least 100
countries. The rapidly evolving epidemiology of the pandemic and absence of licensed prophylactics or
therapeutics for the disease have accelerated the need to elucidate the molecular biology of this novel
coronavirus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it shares genetic and morphologic features with
others in the Coronaviridae family, particularly those from the Betacoronavirus genus. The genome of the
recently isolated SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% nucleotide identity with human SARS-CoV and 89% with bat
SARS-like-CoVZXC21 (Lu et al., 2020). The spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, bears significant
structural homology with SARS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV. Like SARSCoV, the surface Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the same host receptor, ACE-2, to mediate
cell entry (Letko et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020a). S—a class I fusion protein—is also a critical determinant
of viral host range and tissue tropism and the primary target of the host immune response (Li, 2016). As
such, most coronavirus vaccine candidates are based on S or one of its sub-components. Coronavirus S
glycoproteins contain three segments: a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor and a short
intracellular tail. The ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit, S1, which contains two subdomains: one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus. The latter comprises the receptor-binding
domain (RBD), which serves the vital function of attaching the virus to the host receptor and triggering a
conformational change in the protein that results in fusion with the host cell membrane through the S2
subunit.

Recently, the molecular structure of recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was
solved in a stabilized pre-fusion state, by single particle cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM), at a
resolution of 3.8 Å(Wrapp et al., 2020). Despite the comprehensive structural characterization of the spike
protein as a whole, movement of the RBD between “up” and “down” conformational states prevented
complete modeling of the RBD domains. Subsequent cryo-EM investigations of SARS-CoV-2 provided
more detail of RBD, particularly at sites that contact the human ACE-2 receptor (Yan et al., 2020a). Here,
we report the first high resolution—less than 2 Å—SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Additionally, we present the
antigenicity of this recombinant RBD, particularly of interest, given the equipoise in the literature regarding
the binding affinities of SARS-CoV antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Early reports, have described that
the human SARS-CoV antibody, CR3022, is able to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. In the present study,
we verify binding, and subsequently solved the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with CR3022
with a novel “cryptic” epitope.

RESULTS
High resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 313-532), with a C-terminal His-tag, was expressed in 293F
cells, and purified by NiNTA affinity, and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystallization condition
screening identified 20% Jeffamine D2000, 10% Jeffamine M2005, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1M MES pH 5.5 for
diffraction quality crystal growth. Crystals diffracted to <1.8 Å in group P 41 21 2 and to a complete dataset
to 1.95 Å that could be scaled and processed (Table 1). The structure was refined to an Rfree of 20% and
Rwork of 22% with no Ramachandran outliers. S residues 313-532 were clearly interpretable from the
electron density map, with a dual conformation of a loop containing residues 484 to 487 clearly visible in
the electron density map (Figure 1). Structure comparison of the unliganded RBD structure presented here,
with the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S-2P) molecule structure determined by Cryo-EM (PDB
ID: 6VSB) (Wrapp et al., 2020) shows high structural similarity, with an RMSD of 0.68, 0.68, and 0.71 for
each of the spike protomers. In the structure of the S-2P molecule (S-2P) (Wrapp et al., 2020) 25, 29 or 49

amino acids (aa) within each protomer RBD are not modeled, including 40% of the ACE-2 receptor binding
site as measured by buried surface area (BSA)(Yan et al., 2020b). The SARS-CoV RBD-2 compared to
liganded (PDB ID: 2AJF) and unliganded (PDB ID: 2GHV) SARS-CoV RBD structures shows high
structural similarity, except for residues 473-488 (Figure 1). A chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD structure (PDB
ID: 6VW1) with 23 aa differences compared to SARS-CoV-2, in complex with human ACE-2 was recently
released in the PDB. Comparisons with previously published structures with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
highlight residues 473-488 as an area with significant structural plasticity. In the RBD structure from this
study, we observe electron density for two conformations of the 482-486 loop. One of these conformations
is highly similar to the ligand bound form of the RBD, while the second conformation would clash with the
ACE2 receptor. Both this structural detail of the unliganded RBD and comparison to previously described
RBD structures indicates that this area of the RBD is structurally malleable with implications for antibody
or small molecule therapeutics design.

Identification of a set of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
In an effort to identify antibodies that could bind to SARS-CoV-2, we screened a set of SARSCoV,(Tripp et al., 2005) and MERS CoV(Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015) RBD-reactive antibodies
for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We demonstrated that the SARS-CoV mouse antibody 240CD (Tripp
et al., 2005) had nanomolar (nM) affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and did not significantly block ACE2 receptor binding (Figure 2). CR3022—a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody (Tian et al., 2020) identified
from a human phage-display library (ter Meulen et al., 2006)—also bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with nM
affinity (Figure 2B). We assessed competition binding between 240CD and CR3022, and show that these
antibodies cross-compete with each other for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 2C, 2D).
SARS-CoV-2 has a likely zoonotic origin and horseshoe bats have been implicated as natural
reservoirs of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Menachery et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020). As such, we
next explored antibody cross-reactivity with the S glycoproteins of two bat SARS-related CoVs: SARSrCoV Rs4874 (Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015) and Rs4231 (Hu et al., 2017), which are closely related to

the progenitor of SARS-CoV and retain the ability to utilize human ACE-2. CR3022 was able to recognize
a recombinant Spike glycoproteins generated from bat SARSr-CoV Rs4874, while 240CD, and other mouse
generated monoclonal antibodies have a mixed recognition phenotype (Figure 2F).

Crystal structure of antibody CR3022 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
The antigenic cross-reactivity of this set of antibodies precipitated an investigation into their
molecular recognition determinants. The potential relevance of a human antibody motivated the
investigation to prioritize studies of CR3022, for which a sequence was available (ter Meulen et al., 2006).
The CR3022 heavy chain is encoded by IGHV5-51*03, contains a 12-aa CDR H3 with 8 V gene-encoded
residues altered by somatic hypermutation. CR3022 light chain is encoded by IGKV4-1*01 with 1 V geneencoded residue, altered by somatic hypermutation, and a 9-aa CDR L3 (Extended Data Figure 2A). To
provide an atomic-level understanding of the structure of the CR3022 antibody, we crystallized the antigenbinding fragment (Fab) of CR3022. Crystals diffracted to 3.2 Å resolution in space group P 21 (Table 1).
Overall the structure of the CR3022 Fab revealed a relatively flat antigen-combining site, with the exception
of an extended protruding 12-aa CDR L1 loop (Figure S2A).
To determine the structure of CR3022 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we carried out
crystallization conditions screening, with crystals of the CR3022-RBD complex forming in 1M Succinic
acid, 0.1M Hepes pH 7, 2% PEG MME2000 and determined the crystal structure by X-ray diffraction to
4.25 Å (Table 1). The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined CR3022
and SARS-CoV-2 RBD structures as search models and was refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 0.242/0.292 (Table
1). CR3022 bound to the RBD at an epitope centered on S glycoprotein residues 377-386 with a total buried
surface area of 871 Å (Figure 3, Figure S2, and Table S1). This region is highly conserved between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S3). Comparison of the CR3022 epitope site with previously described
antibody-complex structures for SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV indicates that CR3022 describes a novel
recognition site (Figure 3 and Figs. S3, S4). Further sequence analysis of the epitope indicates that this
epitope is conserved in betacoronavirus clade 2b, with also some similarity in clade 2d (Fig. S3). To confirm

that this site was also shared with 240CD, we produced an RBD knockout mutant by introducing a glycan
sequon at position 384, and by biolayer interferometry show that both CR3022 and 240CD binding to the
RBD can be eliminated by the introduction of a glycan at this site (Fig. S2D).

Identification of a cryptic site of vulnerability recognized by CR3022
The epitope conservation within the clade explains the antigenic cross-reactivity with both human
SARS-CoV and bat SARS related CoV. To date, there has been extensive structural characterization of the
SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV spike molecule and domains, which provides a framework for understanding
the novel SARS-CoV-2 spike molecule (Table S2). In the context of the coronavirus trimeric S
glycoproteins, the RBD displays two prototypical conformations either in an “up” or “down” position, with
implications for receptor binding and cell entry (Table S1). To further analyze these conformations, we
modeled the CR3022 binding to the trimeric structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The
CR3022 epitope is occluded by adjacent spike protomers when the RBD is in the “down” conformation,
but becomes more accessible when the spike is in a more open conformation here multiple RBD molecules
are in the “up” conformation (Figure 4). There is still a clash of the antibody Fc1 region with the NTD
from the same protomer, or an RBD from an adjacent protomer when modeled using the static structure.
To understand whether CR3022 could bind to SARS-CoV S glycoproteins, we measured binding
to stabilized S-2P or non-stabilized versions of S (Figure 4). We observed robust binding to the nonstabilized S glycoprotein, while binding to SARS S-2P Trimer was low. We then treated the SARS S-2P
trimer with trypsin and/or incubation with the ACE2 receptor to assess whether minimal proteolytic action
or receptor binding could increase the availability of the “cryptic” CR3022 epitope. Incubation of the
stabilized S-2P trimer with human ACE2 did not dramatically affect CR3022 binding, while in contrast,
the trypsin treatment of the S-2P protein resulted in increased binding akin to the unstabilized S
glycoprotein binding, and the level of binding was titratable, with increasing amounts of S-2P resulting in
higher CR3022 binding. Given the prior neutralization and protection studies utilizing CR3022, and its

ability to complement potent neutralizing antibodies, it is likely that the CR3022 epitope represents a
“cryptic” epitope that becomes exposed during the processes of viral cell entry.
In summary, our data represents the most detailed structural information for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
to date and the first structure of the SARS-CoV-2 in complex with a human antibody. The presence of
“cryptic” but protective epitopes for influenza (Bangaru et al., 2019), and Ebola viruses (West et al., 2018),
have been previously described. The identification of a novel “cryptic” epitope for betacoronaviruses
including SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 highlight a novel viral vulnerability that can be harnessed in
combination with ACE2 receptor site targeting monoclonal antibodies for vaccine and therapeutic
countermeasure development.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Production of recombinant proteins
The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, in collaboration with the Central
Hospital of Wuhan, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the Wuhan Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese
Center for Disease Control, and the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia released the sequence of a
coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from Wuhan on January 10th available at
recombinomics.co/topic/4351-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov-sequences/.

The

sequence

was

also

deposited in GenBank (accession MN908947) and GISAID (>EPI_ISL_402125). DNA encoding the
SARS-Cov-2 RBD (residues 331-527) was synthesized (Genscript) with a C-terminal His6 purification tag
and cloned into a CMVR plasmid, and protein was expressed by transient transfection in 293F cells for six
days. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His protein was purified from cell culture supernatant using a Ni-NTA
(Qiagen) affinity column. DNA encoding the S protein ectodomains (residues 1-1194) from bat SARSrelated CoV isolates Rs4231 and Rs4874 (ref.(Hu et al., 2017)) were synthesized (Genscript) with a Cterminal T4-Foldon domain or C-terminal GCN domain, respectively, followed by factor xA cleavage sites
and Strep-Tactin purification tags. Bat SARSr-CoV S genes were cloned into a modified pcDNA3.1
expression plasmid (Chan et al., 2009). Protein was initially expressed by transient transfection in 293F
cells for six days, then serial cloned to select stably expressing cell lines (Yan L., in submission). The
Rs4231-T4 and Rs4874-GCN S proteins were purified from cell culture supernatant using a Strep-Tactin
affinity column. The oligomeric structure of these S proteins was selected by size exclusion
chromatography (GE/AKTA) and trimeric S proteins were confirmed by Native-PAGE. SARS S-2P was
produced as previously described, with Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration
using a 16/60 Superdex-200 purification column. Purification purity for all S glycoproteins was assessed
by SDS-PAGE.
The sequences of the CR3022 variable regions of the heavy and light chains are available in
GenBank under accession numbers DQ168569 and DQ168570, respectively (ter Meulen et al., 2006). These

sequences were synthesized (Genscript) and cloned into CMVR expression vectors (NIH AIDS reagent
program) between a murine Ig leader (GenBank DQ407610) and the constant regions of human IgG1
(GenBank AAA02914), Igκ (GenBank AKL91145). Plasmids encoding heavy and light chains were cotransfected into Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 5 days,
antibodies were purified from cleared culture supernatants with Protein A agarose (ThermoFisher) using
standard procedures, buffer exchanged into Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), and quantified using
calculated E and A280 measurements.
The Fab fragment of antibody CR3022 was prepared by digestion of the full-length IgG using
enzyme Lys-C (Roche). The digestion reaction was allowed to proceed for 2.5 hours at 37°C. Digestion
was assessed by SDS-PAGE and upon completion, the reaction mixture was passed through protein-G
beads (0.5-1 ml beads), 3 times and the final flow through was assessed by SDS-PAGE for purity. The Fab
fragment was mixed with purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and the complex was allowed to form for 1 hour at
room temperature.

Cell lines
Expi293F (ThermoFisher Scientific #A14527), and 293F cell lines were utilized in this study.

X-ray Crystallography
Crystallization
SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 10 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml in PBS buffer was screened for crystallization conditions
using an Art Robbins Gryphon crystallization robot, 0.2 ul drops, and a set of 1200 crystallization
conditions. Crystal drops were observed using a Jan Scientific UVEX-PS with automated UV and
brightfield drop imaging robot. Crystals of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD grew after 24 hours in multiple
conditions from the Molecular Dimensions MIDAS crystal screen, with diffraction-quality crystals seen in
conditions B1, G1, F6, and H10. CR3022 Fab was screened for crystallization at 10.0 mg/ml and 5.0 mg/ml
concentrations in PBS. Diffraction quality crystals grew after 48 hours in 0.1M Imidazole pH 6.5, 40% 2propanol and 15% PEG 8,000. For the complex, CR3022 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were mixed in 1:1
molar ratio and crystallization drops were set-up at 8.0 and 4.0 mg/ml concentrations in PBS buffer as
described above. Crystals grew in a crystallization condition containing 1M Succinic acid, 0.1M HEPES
pH 7.0 and 2% PEG MME2000. Both, RBD alone and CR3022 Fab-RBD complex, crystals were harvested
and cryo-cooled in their respective crystallization conditions plus 25% glycerol.
Diffraction data collection and processing
Single crystals were transferred to mother liquor containing 22% glycerol, and cryo-cooled in liquid
nitrogen prior to data collection. Diffraction data for SARS-CoV-2 RBD were collected at Advanced
Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, NE-CAT ID24-C beamline, and measured using a
Dectris Eiger 16M PIXEL detector. Crystals grown in MIDAS condition B1 (20% Jeffamine D2000, 10%
Jeffamine M2005, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1M MES pH 5.5) provided the highest resolution diffraction with spots
visible to 1.8 Å. A complete dataset could be processed to 1.95 Å in space group P41212. CR3022 Fab
crystals diffracted to 3.3 Å on NE-CAT ID24-C beamline. Diffraction data could be scaled in P21 space

group with 99.9% completeness. Diffraction data for CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex were
collected on NE-CAT ID24-C beamline at Advanced Photon Source (APS), and measured using a Dectris
Eiger 16M PIXEL detector. Diffraction data from multiple crystals were merged and scaled together to
achieve a final resolution of 4.2 Å with overall completeness of 82.2%. Data collection statistics are
reported in Table 1.
Structure solution and refinement
Phenix xtriage was used to analyze the scaled diffraction data produced from HKL2000 and XDS. Data
was analyzed for completeness, Matthew’s coefficient, twinning or pseudo-translational pathology. The
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser and a search
model of the SARS RBD (PDB ID: 2AJF, molecule C). CR3022 Fab crystal structure was determined by
molecular replacement using Coxsackievirus A6 neutralizing antibody 1D5 (PDB ID: 5XS7) as a search
model. The CR3022-RBD complex structure was determined by molecular replacement using the refined
CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD structures as search models. Refinement was carried out using Phenix
refine with positional, global isotropic B factor refinement, and defined TLS groups, with iterative cycles
of manual model building using COOT. Structure quality was assessed with MolProbity. The final
refinement statistics for all the structures are reported in Table 1. All structure figures were generated using
PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System [DeLano Scientific]).

Structure comparisons
Weighing epitope sites based on antigen-antibody interactions
Epitope sites correspond to antigen sites that are in contact with the antibody in the antigen-antibody
complex (i.e. all sites that have non-hydrogen atoms within 4 Å of the antibody). For a given epitope site,
the weight, which characterizes the interaction between the epitope site and the antibody (improved based
on (Bai et al., 2019)), was defined as:
1 𝑛𝑐
𝑛𝑛𝑏
𝑤= (
+
)
〈𝑛
〉
〈𝑛
2
𝑐
𝑛𝑏 〉

in which, nc is the number of contacts with the antibody (i.e. the number of non-hydrogen antibody atoms
within 4 Å of the site) ; nnb is the number of neighboring antibody residues; 〈𝑛𝑐 〉 is the mean number of
contacts nc and 〈𝑛𝑛𝑏 〉 is the mean number of neighboring antibody residues nnb across all epitope sites. A
weight of 1.0 is attributed to the average interaction across all epitope sites. Neighboring residue pairs were
identified by Delaunay tetrahedralization of side-chain centers of residues (C is counted as a side chain
atom, pairs further than 8.5 Å were excluded). Quickhull(Barber, 1996) was used for the tetrahedralization
and Biopython PDB (Hamelryck and Manderick, 2003) to handle the protein structure.
In the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 RBD comparison, residues were considered similar for the
following residues pairs: RK, RQ, KQ, QE, QN, ED, DN, TS, SA, VI, IL, LM and FY.

Biolayer interferometry
Affinity kinetic interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins and antibodies were monitored on an
Octet RED96 instrument (FortéBio). After reference subtraction, binding kinetic constants were
determined, from at least 4 concentrations of Fab, by fitting the curves to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model
using the Data analysis software 9.0 (FortéBio). Antibodies were loaded at 30 ug/ml onto a AHC probe for
120 s followed by baseline incubation for 30-60 s.
To assess antibody competition, either 240CD or CR3022 or a non-specific control antibody CR107 was incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD prior to assessment of binding to CR3022 or 240CD.
Antibody concentration was 30 ug/ml. To assess binding of human ACE-2 receptor in the presence or
absence of antibodies CR3022, or 240CD, RBD was loaded onto a HIS probe. The RBD was then
sequentially incubated with either CR3022, 240CD or control antibody CR1-07 prior to incubation with
human ACE-2 receptor.
CR3022 was loaded onto an AHC probe for 120s prior to incubation with SARS-CoV S
glycoproteins (15 ug/ml) alone or pre-incubated with ACE2 protein. SARS S-2P protein was treated with
0.1% bovine pancreas trypsin for 10 minutes prior to binding to binding measurements. SARS Spike protein

calculated using a minimum of four dilutions of the RBD and fitted using a 1:1 binding model. C,D,
Competition binding of antibodies CR3022 and 240CD to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. CR3022 or control antibody
was allowed to bind to SARS-COV-2 prior to binding to 240CD or vice-versa. E SARS-CoV-2 RBD was
sequentially bound by antibodies CR3022 or 240CD followed by soluble human ACE2 receptor. F SARSCoV reactive antibodies were assessed for binding to bat SARS-related CoV Rs4784 and Rs4231 S
glycoproteins.

Figure 4. Identification of CR3022 epitope as a “cryptic” epitope. Structural alignment of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-CR3022 complex with the SARS-CoV S-2P structure. A The RBD-CR3022
structure is aligned to the SARS-CoV trimer structure (surface representation; PDB ID: 6CS1), where
two RBD molecules are located in the “up” conformation. In this static structure, the Fc1 region of
CR3022 (ribbon representation) clashes with the NTD of the same protomer. However, the epitope is
fully accessible when more than one RBD is in the “up” representation. B Biolayer interferometry
measurement of CR3022 binding to SARS S proteins with trypsin treatment or ACE2 receptor binding.
C CR3022 binding to a serial dilution of SARS S-2P protein following trypsin treatment.

Fig. S3. Structural and sequence analysis of the CR3022 epitope. Analysis of the CR3022 footprint
across betacoronaviruses. The CR3022 epitope on SARS-CoV-2 (China.Wuhan.30Dec19.402132)
RBD is compared across betacoronaviruses. The epitope is numbered according to the Wuhan
reference; the strength of the interaction between the Ab and the spike protein is indicated by the
height and color of the histogram bars above the sequence alignment. Sequences are ordered based
on their phylogenetic relationships based on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from
amino acid RBD sequences. The RBD structure is shown in surface representation and depicts
mutations between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in red; the CR3022 epitope is outlined in white,
with contact residues shown in stick representation.
