ABSTRACT

39

COVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known

40

about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges

41

underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been com-

42

pletely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (cap-

43

ture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta)

44

sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual var-

45

iations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral

46

load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other char-

47

acteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first

48

work systematically implements amplicon and capture approaches in sequencing

49

HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers

50

practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other

51

emerging viruses.

INTRODUCTION

54

As of 14 March 2020, human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19) has surpassed severe acute

55

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coro-

56

navirus (MERS-CoV) in every aspect, infecting over 140,000 people in more than 110 coun-

57

tries, with a mortality of over 5,0001,2. So far, coronaviruses have caused three major

58

epidemics in the past two decades, posing a great challenge to global health and economy.

59

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of viral genomes has demonstrated enormous capac-

60

ity as a powerful tool to study emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika,

61

and Ebola, in tracing the outbreak origin and drivers, tracking transmission chains, mapping

62

the spread, and monitoring the evolution of the etiological agents3-8. Though by 14 March

63

2020, fewer than 500 HCoV-19 genomes were published on public databases including

64

China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb), NCBI GenBank, the Global initiative on

65

sharing all influenza data (GISAID), etc, and much remains unknown about the epidemiol-

66

ogy and evolution of the virus. One possible explanation of the paucity of published HCoV-

67

19 genomes was the challenges posed by sequencing clinical samples with low virus abun-

68

dance.

69

The first teams obtained the HCoV-19 genome sequences through metatranscriptomic

70

MPS, supplemented by PCR and Sanger sequencing of a combination of bronchoalveolar-

71

lavage fluid (BALF) and culture9-11 or from BALF directly12,13. Experience from studying

72

SARS-CoV showed that BALF from the lower respiratory tract was an ideal sample type with

73

higher viral load14. However, BALF was not routinely collected from every patient, and hu-

74

man airway epithelial (HAE) cell culture is very labor-intensive and time-consuming, taking

75

four to six weeks10,15. The University of Hong Kong team managed to get the whole-genome

76

sequences through metatranscriptomic sequencing with Oxford Nanopore platform supple-

77

mented by Sanger sequencing from both nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens after sin-

78

gle-primer amplification16. The United States scientists published the whole-genome se-

79

quence using oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens through Sanger and meta-

80

transcriptomic sequencing with both Illumina and MinIon17. To date, multiplex PCR-based

81

or hybrid capture-based whole-genome sequencing of HCoV-19, as well as comparative

82

studies between different approaches, have not been reported on peer-reviewed journals.

83

Besides inter-individual variations, dissecting intra-individual dynamics of viruses also

84

largely promotes our understanding of viral-host interactions, viral evolution and transmis-

85

sion as demonstrated for Ebola, Zika, Influenza, etc6,18-20. The analyses of intra-individual

86

single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) and its allele frequency have also contributed to anti-

87

viral therapy and drug resistance, e.g., to reveal highly conserved genes during the outbreak

88

that potentially serve as ideal therapeutic targets19,21. However, it is a challenge to accurately

89

detect iSNVs from clinical samples, especially when the samples are subjected to extra

90

steps of enrichment and amplification.

91

Therefore, we aim to comprehensively compare the sensitivity, inter-individual (variant) and

92

intra-individual (iSNV) accuracy, and other general features of different approaches by sys-

93

tematically utilizing ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic, hybrid capture-based, and

94

amplicon-based sequencing approaches to obtain genomic information of HCoV-19 from

95

serial dilutions of a cultured isolate and directly from clinical samples. We present a reason-

96

able sequencing strategy that fits into different scenarios, and estimate the minimal amount

97

of sequencing data necessary for downstream HCoV-19 genome analyses. Our study, to-

98

gether with our tailor-made experimental workflows and bioinformatics pipelines, offers very

99

practical solutions to facilitate the studies of HCoV-19 and other emerging viruses in the

100

future and would promote extensive genomic sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and

101

other emerging viruses, underpinning more comprehensive real-time virus surveillance and

102

more efficient viral outbreaks managing.

103

RESULTS

104

Design of the comparative study. We sampled eight specimens from COVID-19 patients

105

in February 2020, including throat swab, nasal swab, anal swab and sputum specimens,

106

and the corresponding cycle threshold (Ct) value of HCoV-19 qRT-PCR ranges from 18 to

107

32 (Table 1). We initially tried to boost the coverage and depth of the viral genome by ultra-

108

deep metatranscriptomic sequencing with an average sequencing amount of 1,607,264,105

109

paired-end reads (Table 1). Although we managed to obtain complete viral genome assem-

110

blies for each specimen, the sequencing depth varied across specimens. Only 0.002%-

111

0.003% of the total reads were assigned to the HCoV-19 in three samples (GZMU0014,

112

GZMU0030 and GZMU0031) with Ct between 29-32, resulting in inferior sequencing depth

113

(less than 100X) (Table 1). Isolating viruses and enriching them in cell culture might improve

114

the situation, but this requires high-standard laboratory settings and expertise apart from

115

being time-consuming. Also, unwanted mutations that are not concordant with original clin-

116

ical samples may be introduced during the culturing process.

117

To enrich adequate viral content for whole-genome sequencing in a convenient manner, we

118

pursued two other methods: multiplex PCR amplification (amplicon) and hybrid capture

119

(capture) (Fig. 1). We designed a systematic study to comprehensively validate the bias,

120

sensitivity, inter-individual (variant) and intra-individual (iSNV) accuracy of multiple ap-

121

proaches by sequencing serial dilutions of a cultured isolate (unpublished), as well as the

122

eight clinical samples (Fig. 2). We performed qRT-PCR of 10-fold serial dilutions (D1-D7) of

123

the cultured isolate, and the Ct was 17.3, 20.8, 24.5 for, 28.7, 31.8, 35, and 39.9, respec-

124

tively, indicating the undiluted RNA (D0) of the cultured isolate contained ~1E+08 genome

125

copies per mL. For amplicon sequencing, we utilized two kits comprising of two set of pri-

126

mers generating PCR products of 300-400 bp and 100-200 bp, respectively. The ~400 bp

127

amplicon-based sequencing was implemented in all samples and analyzed throughout the

128

study, while the ~200 bp amplicon-based sequencing was only applied in the cultured isolate

129

for coverage analysis.

130

Comparison of evenness and sensitivity. Theoretically, amplicon sequencing should be

131

the most sensitive and economical method among the three, and is particularly suitable in

132

an outbreak where viral isolates are highly related. Although, there are still potential pitfalls,

133

for instance, the 40 cycle-PCR in our workflow might augment trace amounts of HCoV-19

134

cross-contamination. To ensure the confidence of the datasets, we included serial dilutions

135

of the cultured isolate and negative controls prepared from nuclease-free water and human

136

nucleic acids since the 1st PCR. All samples in ~400 bp amplicon-based sequencing exhib-

137

ited > 99.5% coverage across the HCoV-19 genome except for 1E+01 (95.23%),

138

GZMU0031 (73.65%), HNA (6.17%), water (60.24%), suggesting the primers were well de-

139

signed and the positive datasets were reliable. We also set stringent and method-specific

140

criteria to filter low-confidence sequencing reads and samples (see Methods), e.g., clinical

141

sample GZMU0031 was excluded for downstream sensitivity and accuracy validation due

142

to inadequate depth in amplicon sequencing (Fig. 3a). Another pitfall is that amplification

143

across the genome can hardly be unbiased, causing difficulties in complete genome assem-

144

bly. Indeed, amplicon sequencing exhibited a higher level of bias compared with meta-

145

transcriptomic sequencing, in terms of coverage across the viral genomes from the cultural

146

isolate and the clinical samples tested in our study (Fig. 3b, d, Supplementary Fig. 1). To

147

our surprise, however, capture sequencing was almost as unbiased as meta sequencing,

148

demonstrating better performance than the previous capture method used to enrich ZIKV

149

despite the HCoV-19 genome is ~3 fold larger than ZIKV22 (Fig. 3b, c). Two reasons

150

amongst others were likely to be accountable to this improvement, 1) we utilized 506 pieces

151

of 120 ssDNA probes covering 2x of the HCoV-19 genome to capture the libraries, 2) we

152

employed the DNBSEQ sequencing technology that features PCR-free rolling circle replica-

153

tion (RCR) of DNA Nanoballs (DNBs)23,24.

154

The sequencing results of amplicon and capture approaches revealed dramatic increases

155

in the ratio of HCoV-19 reads out of the total reads compared with meta sequencing, sug-

156

gesting the enrichment was highly efficient - 5596-fold in capture method and 5710-fold in

157

amplicon method for each sample on average (Supplementary Table 1-2). To further com-

158

pare the sensitivity of different methods, we plotted the number of HCoV-19 reads per million

159

(HCoV-19-RPM) of total sequencing reads against the viral concentration for each sample.

160

The productivity was similar between the two methods when the input RNA of the cultured

161

isolate contained 1E+05 genome copies per mL and above (Fig. 3e). However, amplicon

162

sequencing produced 10-100 fold more HCoV-19 reads than capture sequencing when the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.993584; this version posted March 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

163

input RNA concentration of the cultured isolate was 1E+04 genome copies per mL and

164

lower, suggesting amplicon-based enrichment was more efficient than capture for more

165

challenging samples (conc. ≤ 1E+04 genome copies per mL, or Ct ≥ 28.7) (Fig. 3e). Meta

166

sequencing - as expected - produced dramatically lower HCoV-19-RPM than the other two

167

methods among clinical samples tested with a wide range of Ct values, whereas amplicon

168

and capture were generally comparable to each other (Fig. 3e). Considering the costs for

169

sequencing, storage, and analysis increase substantially with larger datasets, we tried to

170

estimate how much sequencing data must be produced for each approach in order to

171

achieve 10X depth across 95% of the HCoV-19 genome, and the results can be found in

172

Supplementary Table 3. As a practical, cost-effective guidance for future sequencing, we

173

also assessed the minimum amount of data required to pass the stringent filters (≥ 95%

174

coverage and method-specific depth, see Methods) in our pipelines corresponding to differ-

175

ent viral loads. We estimated that for high-confidence downstream analyses, amplicon se-

176

quencing requires at least 2,757 to 186 Mega bases (Mb) for samples containing 1E+02 to

177

1E+06 copies of HCoV-19 genome per mL, while capture sequencing requires 24,474 to 9

178

Mb for the same situation (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Table 4).

179

Investigation of inter- and intra-individual variations. To determine the accuracy of dif-

180

ferent approaches in discovering inter-individual genetic diversity, we tested each method

181

in calling the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and verified some of the SNVs with Sanger

182

sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2). Two to five SNVs were identified within each clinical

183

sample, and in all the seven samples, SNVs identified by the three methods were concord-

184

ant except that capture missed one SNV at position 16535 in GZMU0014 (Fig. 4a). We then

185

investigated the allele frequencies of these sites across methods, and found that alleles

186

identified by capture sequencing displayed lower frequencies than the other two methods,

187

especially for GZMU0014, GZMU0030, and GZMU0042 where the viral load was lower (Ct

188

≥ 29), which explained why capture sequencing neglected an SNV in our pipeline when the

189

cutoff of SNV calling was set as 80% allele frequency (Fig. 4b). These data indicate that

190

amplicon sequencing is more accurate than capture sequencing in identifying SNVs, espe-

191

cially for challenging samples.

192

To further determine the accuracy of different approaches in identifying HCoV-19 iSNVs, we

193

examined minor allele frequencies in serial dilutions of the cultured HCoV-19 isolate and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.993584; this version posted March 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

194

clinical samples. For serial dilutions of the cultured isolate, the minor allele frequencies de-

195

tected in capture sequencing datasets were generally approximate to meta sequencing,

196

while most allele frequencies in amplicon sequencing datasets deviated with those in meta

197

sequencing (Fig. 4c) A similar pattern was shown for clinical samples, indicating that am-

198

plicon sequencing was unreliable of quantifying minor allele frequencies (Fig. 4d). Plotting

199

allele frequencies against HCoV-19 concentrations supported the above finding, and further

200

revealed that amplicon sequencing was unreliable of allele frequencies at all concentrations

201

while capture sequencing was reliable at > 1E+03 genome copies per mL (Supplementary

202

Fig. 3). Referring to the iSNV identified in clinical samples by meta sequencing, we then

203

calculated the false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) of minor alleles called

204

by amplicon and capture methods. The FPR and FNR of minor alleles identified in amplicon

205

sequencing was 0.74% and 66.67%, while that in capture sequencing was 0.02% and 0%,

206

respectively. Together these results suggest amplicon sequencing was not as accurate as

207

capture sequencing in identifying minor alleles, which could be in part due to Matthew effect

208

caused by PCR.

209

Microbiome in clinical samples. In addition to target viral genome, metatranscriptomic

210

sequencing has also allowed us to investigate RNA expression patterns of the overall mi-

211

crobiome and host content and thus suitable for discovering new viruses, distinguishing co-

212

infections, and dissecting virus-host interactions. To explore the microbiota, we performed

213

further metatranscriptomics analysis of the clinical samples. We were able to identify host

214

nucleic acids in all of the samples, and over 95% of total reads were from the host in sputum,

215

nasal, and throat samples (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Virus contributed to less than 5% of

216

reads in anal swab and throat swab while more than 50% of reads in nasal swab (Supple-

217

mentary Fig. 4b). These results suggest nasal swab could be the most ideal sample type for

218

viral detection among the four sample types, which agrees with recent clinical evidence25.

219

Among the viral reads, over 90% were Coronaviridae, which is consistent with clinical diag-

220

nostics (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Reads from other viruses were also identified, indicating

221

further measurements could be taken to confirm if co-infection exists (Supplementary Fig.

222

4). Bacterial composition was also shown, providing support for scientific research, as well

223

as for further confirmation of bacterial infection and antibiotics prescription (Supplementary

224

Fig. 4d-f).

225

Guidance for virus sequencing. Taken together, each sequencing scheme elaborated

226

here for massively parallel sequencing of HCoV-19 genomes has its own merits (Table 2).

227

We hereby propose a reasonable, cost-effective strategy for sequencing and analyzing

228

HCoV-19 under different situations: 1) if one wants to study other genetic materials than the

229

target viruses, or the viruses become highly diversified via recombinational events, or the

230

viral load within the RNA sample is high (e.g. conc. ≥ 1E+05 viral genome copies per mL, or

231

Ct ≤ 24.5), meta sequencing can be prioritized; 2) if one focuses on intra-individual variations

232

for more challenging samples (e.g. conc. < 1E+05 viral genome copies per mL, or Ct > 24.5),

233

capture sequencing seems to be a justified choice; and, 3) if identifying SNVs is the main

234

purpose, the most convenient, economical strategy would be amplicon sequencing that can

235

support high-confidence analyses of samples containing viral content as low as 1E+02 viral

236

genome copies per mL, or Ct as high as 35.

237

DISCUSSION

238

Sequencing low-titre viruses directly from clinical samples is challenging, which is further

239

exacerbated by the fact that coronavirus genomes are the largest among RNA viruses (~3

240

fold larger compared with ZIKV). Compared with direct metatranscriptomic sequencing, high

241

sensitivity of hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing methods come at a price of low ac-

242

curacy, and neither of the two can be used to sequence highly diverse or recombinant vi-

243

ruses because the primers and probes are specific to known viral genomes. Amplicon se-

244

quencing compromises its accuracy, while it becomes the most convenient and economical

245

method of all. Either or a combination of the approaches described here can be chosen to

246

cope with various needs of researchers, e.g., metatranscriptomic sequencing data with in-

247

sufficient coverage and depth can be pooled with hybrid capture data to generate high qual-

248

ity assemblies22. Our research, as well as the methods elaborated here, are able to help

249

other researchers to sequence and analyze large viruses from clinical samples and thus

250

benefit investigations on the genomic epidemiology of viruses.

251

Some pros and cons described above might be specific to the experimental workflows and

252

bioinformatics pipelines tailored in this study, e.g., 1) the bias of amplicon sequencing can

253

be improved by reducing the amount of cycles in the 1st PCR or optimize the molar ratios

254

of primers (Fig. 1a), 2) the amplicon sequencing is particularly convenient compared with

255

previous counterparts since the fragmentation and library construction steps are omitted

256

here by integrating adaptor and barcode ligation in the 2nd PCR and sequencing the ampli-

257

cons using single-end 400 nt reads (Fig. 1a), 3) using anything less than 506 pieces of 120

258

ssDNA probes in hybrid capture may attenuate the sequencing coverage while increase the

259

bias, 4) metatranscriptomic sequencing was conducted with an ultra-high-throughput se-

260

quencing platform so that the successful rate was substantially higher than usual. 5) the

261

minimal amount of data necessary for analyzing the HCoV-19 genome from clinical samples

262

across methods is higher than that predicted by data from the cultured isolate was probably

263

due to the high nucleic acids background from the host and other microbes (Supplementary

264

Table 3-4, Supplementary Fig. 4). Also, we do not take into account the time spent in se-

265

quencing since the workflows can be easily adapted in order to be compatible with various

266

platforms including Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), besides DNBSEQ

267

of MGI.

285

Metatranscriptomic library preparation and sequencing

286

Host DNA was removed from RNA samples using DNaseⅠ, and the concentration of RNA

287

samples was measured by Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,

288

MA, USA). DNA-depleted and purified RNA was used to construct the single-stranded cir-

289

cular DNA library with MGIEasy RNA Library preparation reagent set (MGI, Shenzhen,

290

China), as follows: 1) RNA was fragmented by incubating with fragmentation buffer at 87°C

291

for 6 min; 2) double-stranded (ds) cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers with frag-

292

mented RNA; 3) ds cDNA was subjected to end repair, adaptor ligation, and 18-cycle PCR

293

amplification; 4) PCR products were Unique Dual Indexed (UDI), before going through cir-

294

cularization, and rolling circle replication (RCR) to generate DNA nanoballs (DNBs)-based

295

libraries. DNBs preps of clinical samples were sequenced on the ultra-high-throughput DNB-

296

SEQ-T7 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China) with paired-end 100 nt strategy, generating 321

297

Gb sequencing data for each sample on average.

298

Hybrid capture-based enrichment and sequencing

299

A hybrid capture technique was used to enrich HCoV-19-specific content from the meta-

300

transcriptomic double-stranded DNA libraries with the 2019-nCoVirus DNA/RNA Capture

301

Panel (BOKE, Jiangsu, China). Manufacturer’s instructions were slightly modified to ac-

302

commodate the MGISEQ-2000 platform, i.e., blocker oligos and PCR primer oligos were

303

replaced by MGIEasy exon capture assistive kit (MGI, Shenzhen, China). DNBs-based li-

304

braries were constructed and sequenced on the MGISEQ-2000 platform with paired-end

305

100 nt strategy using the same protocol described above, generating 37 Gb sequencing

306

data for each sample on average.

307

Amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing

308

Total RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize the first-strand cDNA with random

309

hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).

310

Sequencing was attempted on all samples regardless of Ct value including negative controls

311

prepared from nuclease-free water and NA12878 human gDNA. A two-step HCoV-19

312

genome amplification was performed with an equimolar mixture of primers using ATOPlex

313

SARS-CoV-2 Full Length Genome Panel following the manufacture’s protocol (MGI, Shen-

314

zhen, China), generating 137X ~400 bp amplicons or 299X ~200 bp amplicons and the ge-

315

nome positions of the amplicons are shown in Supplementary Table 5. 20 µl of first-strand

316

cDNA was mixed with the components of the first PCR reaction following the manufacturer’s

317

instructions, including lambda phage gDNA unless specified. 2 ng of Human gDNA was

318

added to each PCR reaction of the cultured isolate. The PCR was performed as follows: 5

319

min at 37°C, 10 min at 95°C, 15 cycles of (10 s at 95°C, 1min at 64°C, 1min at 60°C to 10 s

320

at 72°C), 2 min at 72°C. The products were purified with MGI EasyDNA Clean beads (MGI,

321

BGI-Shenzhen, China) at a 5:4 ratio and cleaned with 80% concentration ethanol according

322

to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 2nd PCR was performed under the same regimen

323

as the 1st PCR except for 25 cycles, and the beads-purified products from the first PCR

324

reaction were unique dual indexed. After the 2nd PCR, products were purified following the

325

same procedures as the 1st PCR and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity

326

assay on Qubit 3.0 (Life Technologies). PCR products of samples yielding sufficient material

327

(> 5 ng/µl) were pooled at equimolar to a total DNA amount of 300 ng before converting to

328

single-stranded circular DNA. DNBs-based libraries were generated from 20 μl of single-

329

stranded circular DNA pools and sequenced on the MGISEQ-2000 platform with single-end

330

400 nt strategy, generating 1.8 Gb sequencing data for each sample on average.

331

Identification of HCoV-19-like reads from Massively Parallel Sequencing data

332

For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data, total reads were first processed

333

by Kraken v0.10.526 (default parameters) with a self-build database of Coronaviridae ge-

334

nomes (including SARS, MERS and HCoV-19 genome sequences downloaded from

335

GISAID, NCBI and CNGB) to efficiently identify candidate viral reads with a loose manner.

336

These candidate reads were further qualified with fastp v0.19.527 (parameters: -q 20 -u 20 -

337

n 1 -l 50) and SOAPnuke v1.5.628 (parameters: -l 20 -q 0.2 -E 50 -n 0.02 -5 0 -Q 2 -G -d) to

338

remove low-quality reads, duplications and adaptor contaminations. Low-complexity reads

339

were next filtered by PRINSEQ v0.20.429 (parameters: -lc_method dust -lc_threshold 7).

340

After the above process, HCoV-19-like reads generated from metatranscriptomics and

341

hybrid capture method were obtained.

342

For amplicon sequencing data, SE 400 reads were first processed with fastp v0.19.527 (pa-

343

rameters: -q 20 -u 20 -n 1 -l 50) to remove low quality-reads and adaptor sequences. Primer

344

sequences and the 21 nt upstream and downstream of primers within the reads were then

345

trimmed with BAMClipper v1.1.130 (Parameters: -n 4 -u 21 -d 21). Reads with low quality

346

bases, adaptors, primers and adjacent sequences completely removed as described above

347

were considered as clean reads for downstream analyses.

348

Assembling viral genome

349

HCoV-19-like reads of metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data were de

350

novo assembled with SPAdes (v3.14.0)31 using the default settings to obtain virus genome

351

sequences. To reduce the complexity of the assembling process, identified HCoV-19-like

352

reads of metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data were subsampled to the

353

data amount greater than 100X sequencing depth for the HCoV-19 genome. For the two

354

metatranscriptomic samples with a sequencing depth lower than 100X for the HCoV-19

355

genome (GZMU0014 and GZMU0030), all HCoV-19-like reads were used for assembling

356

viral genomes.

357

Due to the uneven read coverage in amplicon sequencing of HCoV-19, virus consensus

358

sequences of amplicon samples were generated by Pilon v1.2332 (parameters: --changes –

359

vcf --changes --vcf --mindepth 1 --fix all, amb). Positions with depth less than 100X or lower

360

five times than negative control samples were masked as ambiguous base N.

361

Assessment the coverage depth across the viral genome

362

HCoV-19-like reads of metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data were aligned

363

to the HCoV-19 reference genome (GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_402119) with BWA aln

364

(v0.7.16)33.

365

(v2.10.10)( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) with default settings. For each sample, we

366

calculated the depth of coverage at each nucleotide position of the HCoV-19 reference

367

genome with Samtools (v1.9)34 and scaled the values to the mean depth. For each

368

nucleotide position, we calculated the median depth, and 20th and 80th percentiles across

369

all samples. Read coverage and depth across the HCoV-19 reference genome were plotted

370

by a 200-nt sliding window with the ggplot235 package in R (v3.6.1)36.

371

Amplicon sequencing data were processed as described above, except that duplications

372

were not removed. A heatmap was generated to visualize the viral genome coverage for all

373

samples sequenced by the amplicon method with the pheatmap37 package in R (v3.6.1)36.

374

The depth at each nucleotide position was binarized, and was shown in pink if the depth

375

was 100x and above.

377

Relationships between genome copies and method-dependent minimum amount of

378

sequencing data

379

HCoV-19 reads of metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data were identified

380

by aligning the HcoV-19-like reads to the HCoV-19 reference genome (GISAID accession:

381

EPI_ISL_402119) with BWA in a strict manner of coverage ≥ 95% and identity ≥ 90%. For

382

comparisons of the coverage and depth of the viral genome across samples and methods,

383

we normalized the viral reads to total sequencing reads with HCoV-19 Reads Per Million

384

(HCoV-19-RPM). HCoV-19-RPM for amplicon sequencing data was calculated by the same

385

pipelines we applied for metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data.

386

To estimate the minimum data requirements for genome assembling and intra-individual

387

variation analysis, we applied gradient-based sampling to the HCoV-19 genome align-

388

ments (referred to BAM files) to each dataset using Samtools (v1.9)34. The effective genome

389

coverage was set as 95% for all three MPS methods. Considering the distinct

390

technologies used in different methods, we set method-dependent thresholds of effective

391

depth as follows: 1) ≥ 10X for metatranscriptomic sequencing; 2) ≥ 20X for hybrid capture

392

sequencing; and 3) ≥ 100X for amplicon sequencing. We next calculated the coverage and

393

depth within each subsampled BAM file per sample to determine the minimal BAM file that

394

could meet the above thresholds of both coverage and sequencing depth. The method-

395

dependent minimum amount of sequencing data of each sample were estimated accord-

396

ingly. We assessed the correlations between the HCoV-19 genome copies per mL in diluted

397

samples of cultured isolates and the minimum amount of sequencing data for amplicon-

398

and capture-based methods using Pearson correlation coefficient (R) with the function

399

scatter from the R package ggpubr (v3.6.1)38.

400

Consistency in variants calling performance among methods

401

Except for amplicon sequencing samples, variants calling in metatranscriptomic and hybrid

402

capture sequencing samples was performed in the previous BAM files of identified HCoV-

403

19 reads after removing duplications from alignment output by Picard Markduplicates

404

(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). To accurately identify SNVs from viral sequencing

405

data of all three methods, we first called SNVs with freebayes (v1.3.1)39 (parameters: -p 1 -

406

q 20 -m 60 --min-coverage 10 -V) and then filtered the low-confidence SNVs with snippy-

407

vcf_filter40 (parameters: --minqual 100 --mincov 10 --minfrac 0.8). Remaining SNVs post

408

filtering in VCF files generated by freebayes were annotated in HCoV-19 genome assem-

409

blies and consensus sequences with SNVeff (v4.3)41 using default parameters.

410

Next, we calculated SNV allele frequencies and called iSNVs (intra-host Single Nucleotide

411

Variations) for each dataset to assess the consistency of variants calling performance

412

among

413

manfoo/pysamstats) (parameters: -type variation_strand --min-baseq 20 -D 1000000) to

414

count the number of matches, mismatches, deletions and insertions at each base, estimate

415

nucleotide percentage and determine allele frequencies of SNVs at reference genome po-

416

sitions based on the HCoV-19 alignments from BAM files.

417

For amplicon sequencing data, only base positions covered by ≥100X reads were used for

418

iSNVs calling. For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture-based sequencing data, the

419

thresholds of depth were set as 10X and 20X, respectively. The candidate iSNVs were fur-

420

ther filtered for quality as follows: 1) frequency filtering, only minor alleles (frequency ≥ 5%

421

and <50%) and major alleles (frequency ≥ 50% and ≤ 95%) were remained; 2) depth filter-

422

ing, iSNVs with fewer than five forward or reverse reads were removed; and 3) strand bias

423

filtering (not applicable to single-end reads of amplicon sequencing), iSNVs were removed

424

if there were more than a 10-fold strand bias or a 5-fold difference between the strand bias

425

of the variant call and that of the reference call.

426

Taxonomy of clinical samples by unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing

427

For metatranscriptomic sequencing of clinical samples, raw sequencing data of a single se-

428

quence lane (approximately 60-75 Gb per sample) was used to simultaneously assess the

429

RNA expression patterns of human, bacteria and viruses in clinical samples from COVID-

430

19 patients. We first used software fastp (v0.19.5)27 to filter low-quality reads and remove

431

adapter with parameters: -5 -3 -q 20 -c -l 30. After QC, we mapped high-quality reads to

432

hg19 and removed human ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads by SOAP2 v2.2142 (parameters: -

433

m 0 -x 1000 -s 28 -l 32 -v 5 -r 1), and the remaining RNA reads were then aligned to hg19

434

by HISAT243 with default settings to identify non-rRNA human transcripts as previously de-

435

scribed. Next, we applied Kraken 244 (version 2.0.8-beta, parameters: --threads 24 --confi-

436

dence 0) to assign microbial taxonomic ranks to non-human RNA reads against the large

437
