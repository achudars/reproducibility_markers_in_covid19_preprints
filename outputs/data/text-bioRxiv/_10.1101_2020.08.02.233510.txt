Abstract
The current COVID-19 pandemic urges in-depth investigation into proteins encoded with coronavirus
(CoV), especially conserved CoV replicases. The nsp13 of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV2, and SARS-CoV exhibit the most conserved CoV replicases. Using single-molecule FRET, we
observed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound DNA in discrete steps of approximately 9 bp when ATP was
used. If another NTP was used, then the steps were only 4 to 5 bp. In dwell time analysis, we detected 3
or 4 hidden steps in each unwinding process, which indicated the hydrolysis of 3 or 4 dTTP. Based on
crystallographic and biochemical studies of CoV nsp13 helicases, we modeled an unwinding mechanism
similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, although our model proposes that flexible

1B and stalk domains, by allowing a lag greater than 4 bp during unwinding, cause the accumulated
tension on the nsp13-DNA complex. The hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2
nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible than in MERS-CoV nsp13 due to the difference of a single amino
acid, which causes the former to induce significantly greater NTP hydrolysis. Our findings thus establish
a blueprint for determining the unwinding mechanism of a unique helicase family.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) pose unprecedented threats to human health and the global economy, as
powerfully demonstrated by the current pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The third major CoV outbreak in the past two decades, COVID-19 has triggered devastating effects
dwarfing those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 (1,2) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (3).

SARS-CoV-2 (4), the causative agent of COVID-19, is the seventh human CoV (5), one with
approximately 80% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV. Although the shared sequence
variation is more pronounced in the structural (i.e., envelope E, membrane M, nucleocapsid N, and spike
S) and accessory proteins (i.e., ORF3a or 3b, 6, 7a or 7b, 8, and 10) of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV,
its nonstructural proteins are highly conserved (6). In fact, the central components of the viral RNA
replication transcription complex’s (RTC) nonstructural proteins (nsp)—that is, nsp13 (i.e., helicase)
and nsp12 (i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase)—are more than 98% identical. Perhaps more
remarkable, the nsp13 helicase encoded by three highly pathogenic CoVs—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,
and SARS-CoV-2—shares 84% to 99% sequence similarity, thereby making it a potential widespectrum antiviral target. As a member of the SF1B helicase family, nsp13 unwinds RNA or DNA
duplexes with 5’-to-3’ directionality and hydrolyzes both NTP and dNTP (7,8); it also hosts 5’triphosphatase activity. In previous work, by determining the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13
(PDB ID: 5WWP), we revealed that nsp13 generally mirrors the domain organization of nidovirus
helicases, whereas the individual domains (i.e., CH, RecA1–1B and RecA2) of nsp13 reflect the
organization of cellular Upf1-like helicases (9,10).

Mechanisms of CoV nsp13 have mostly been investigated by using ensemble methods. SARS-CoV sp13
prefers a substrate with long 5’ single-stranded (ssDNA) tails or gaps for duplex unwinding, in which
case multiple nsp13 molecules loading on the 5’ ssDNA regions can enhance the processivity of DNA
unwinding (11). Following the results of a hydrogen–deuterium exchange assay, a translocation
mechanism of nsp13 was proposed (12), one that details the grasp and release of ssDNA relay between
the RecA1–1B and RecA2 domains of nsp13, which correlate with three transition states of ATP
hydrolysis. That model largely reflects the paradigmatic mechanism of the SF1B helicase RecD2 (13).
Another intriguing observation was that the unwinding reaction catalyzed by nsp13 contained lags, and
such lagging became more evident as DNA duplex became longer. Using the rapid chemical quench
flow method, Sarafianos and colleagues detected intermediates during dsDNA unwinding by SARSCoV nsp13 and estimated an average kinetic step size of 9.3 bp per step (14). However, the mechanism
underlying the lagged unwinding was not elaborated.

Because the structural and biochemical characterizations of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV nsp13 are
available, and because SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 differs from SARS-CoV nsp13 by only one conservative
substitution (i.e., I570V), we investigated the kinetic mechanism that allows two nsp13 helicases to
unwind DNA. Our findings not only elucidate that unique helicase’s mechanism but also may contribute
to developing antiviral agents to combat COVID-19, its potential resurgence, and the outbreak of similar
viral diseases in the future.

Results
MERS-CoV Helicase Rapidly Unwound DNA

In our previous biochemical characterization, the way in which MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound an 18-bp
DNA duplex containing a 5’ overhang depended upon NTP hydrolysis. Similarly, SARS-CoV nsp13
was able to unwind a 15-bp partial DNA duplex with the same 5’ overhang. To elucidate their
unwinding mechanism, we designed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)
experiments (Fig. 1A). Using a biotin–NeutrAvidin interaction, we immobilized partial double-stranded
DNAs (dsDNAs) with 5’ ssDNA tails to the imaging surface with biotin at the 5’ termini of the ssDNA
overhangs. The partial dsDNA consisted of an 18-base top strand, labeled at the 3’ end by Cy5 as the
acceptor, and a 37-base bottom strand, labeled at the ssDNA–dsDNA junction by Cy3 as the donor.
After pre-incubating 20 nM of full-length MERS-CoV nsp13 protein with the DNA substrate, we
injected 4 mM of ATP into the system to initiate the reaction. The corresponding FRET values
represented different unwinding states. Before we added ATP, nsp13 bound to the ssDNA portion of the
partial duplex, most likely at the ssDNA–dsDNA junction; thus, the sustained proximity of the donor
and acceptor generated high FRET values. Following the addition of ATP, nsp13 began to translocate on
the bottom strand toward the 3’ end and unzipped the DNA duplex. Once the donor and the acceptor had
separated, FRET values gradually decreased. We visualized the unwinding process by total internal
reflection fluorescent (TIRF) microscopy; representative images of donor and acceptor channels within
1 min after ATP injection appear in Fig. 1B.

We evaluated the corresponding FRET values of the immobilized dsDNAs at different time points after
injecting them with ATP (Fig. 1C). All histograms revealed a high FRET peak followed by a low one,
which respectively corresponded to the original dsDNAs and unwound DNAs. At time 0 (i.e., before
ATP was added), most of the dsDNAs exhibited high FRET values with negligible low FRET peaks.
Following the injection of ATPs, the high FRET peaks decreased with time, whereas the low FRET

peaks increased. Next, we plotted the unwound population according to time (Fig. 1D). At the initial
phase of the reaction, MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound rather rapidly but decelerated with time, most likely
due to the system’s consumption of DNA substrate and ATP. Approximately 45% of the total dsDNA
population unwound in the first 10 s, and approximately 80% had unwound after 1 min. The overall
unwinding rate, R, and unwinding time, T, were determined by fitting the evolution of the unwinding
population with a single exponential function, for values of R = 0.053 s-1 and T = 18.97 s at the selected
experimental condition.

MERS-CoV nsp13 Exhibited Single and Multiple Steps in Unwinding
Under our initial experimental conditions, MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound the DNA duplex in a single step
in most cases, although multistep unwinding also occurred. Fig. 2A shows representative traces of
different unwinding processes. In traces to the left, both processes showed a single FRET decrease
indicating single-step unwinding; in traces to the right, two FRET jumps indicated two working steps
with 9 bp per step. The stable intermediate FRET values suggest that MERS-CoV nsp13 paused the
unwinding of the DNA duplex under certain conditions, which aligns with a finding from a previous
ensemble study on SARS-CoV nsp13-catalyzed unwinding reactions (14). Therein, Sarafianos and
colleagues discovered the presence of intermediates in the unwinding of a DNA duplex by SARS-CoV
nsp13, and using the pre-steady state kinetic assay, they estimated that the unwinding step was
approximately 9.3 bp, which is remarkably similar to unwinding step size of MERS-CoV nsp13 in our
study.

To resolve multistep unwinding, we decelerated the unwinding by supplying different chemical energy
sources at low concentrations. Helicases have different preferences in relation to NTPs; for example,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.233510; this version posted August 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 hydrolyses all eight canonical NTPs in the order of preference (d)ATP >
(d)CTP > UTP or dTTP > (d)GTP (15). Therefore, we used various NTPs (i.e., ATP, GTP, CTP, and
dTTP) to fuel the unwinding reactions and indeed achieved far slower unwinding rates by using those
NTPs as energy sources or at lower concentrations (i.e., 4 mM to 400 nM), as shown in Fig. 2B. The
unwound population decreased from approximately 80% to 35% when we reduced the ATP
concentrations from 4 mM to 400 nM. Other energy sources decreased unwinding rates at lower
concentrations. Although MERS-CoV nsp13 clearly preferred ATP over the other NTPs at high
concentrations (i.e., 40 µM to 4 mM), that preference became subtler at lower concentrations (i.e., 400
nM to 4 µM). As expected, decreasing the unwinding rate increased the incidence of the multistep
unwinding event. When the concentration of GTP, CTP, or dTTP decreased to 400 nM, approximately 6%
of the unwinding events displayed a multistep unwinding process (Fig. 2C). However, that result never
occurred when we used ATP as the energy source, not even when its concentration was 400 nM and the
unwinding rate was as low as that of CTP, GTP, and dTTP.

MERS-CoV nsp13 Unwound the dsDNA in 4 Discrete Steps
The transition density plot (Fig. 3A) was summarized from 140 transitions with FRET changes of
approximately 0.25. Four peaks with enter/exit FRET emerged at approximately 0.97/0.75, 0.76/0.51,
0.50/0.26, and 0.25/0.07. The transition density plot confirmed that the 0.25 FRET length was the
smallest unwinding step observed in experiments, and 4 discrete unwinding steps emerged in the
unwinding process of 18 bp with 400 μM of dTTP.

The trace curves revealed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound the dsDNA in stepwise fashion. Specifically,
MERS-CoV nsp13 lingered at a specific unwinding step (i.e., FRET state) before commencing the next

one. The term dwell time (i.e. FRET exit time minus FRET enter time) is used to describe how long
MERS-CoV nsp13 stayed at a specific FRET state. Dwell time at each FRET state was evaluated from
216 molecules with a multistep unwinding process, and the results (Fig. 3B) indicate that MERS-CoV
nsp13 lingered at every FRET state for approximately 6.94 ± 5.06 s before commencing the next step.
However, dwell time did not show obvious changes with lower concentrations of energy sources.

The dwell time histogram of individual steps appears in Fig. 3C. Because the dwell time histogram did
not follow a single-exponential decay, irreversible Poissonian steps were hidden in the observed
individual steps. Gamma distribution, tn–1 exp(–kt), was used to fit the dwell time histogram, and the
calculated n and k values that emerged were 3.57 ± 1.24 and 1.95 ± 0.82 s-1, respectively, indicating 3 or
4 hidden irreversible Poissonian steps, presumably due to the hydrolysis of single dTTP, with an
identical rate k of approximately 1.95 s-1. Based on those results, our unwinding model for MERS-CoV
helicase maintains that, after 3 or 4 successive dTTP hydrolysis events, an abrupt 4-bp separation
occurred.

Single Point Mutations Affected the Unwinding Rate of MERS nsp13
To gain further insights into the unwinding mechanism, we selected 13 residues, all invariant in SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, from across the nucleic acids binding groove of MERS-CoV nsp13 for a
mutagenesis study (Fig. 4). We predicted that the selected residues would contact ssDNA based on the
modeled structures of MERS-CoV nsp13-ssDNA (9) and SARS-CoV-2 nsp13-ssDNA. The mutations
included S310D, H311D, T359D, N361D, A362D, and P408D on the RecA1 domain; R178D on the 1B
domain; and Y515D, N516D, T532D, D534A S535D, and R560D on the RecA2 domain (Fig. 4A &
4B). Special features of the selected residues were twofold. First, all selected residues had structural

counterparts in EVA nsp10, whose involvement in DNA binding has been confirmed by X-ray
crystallography, as shown in Table 1. Second, the selected residues were located on conserved DNA
binding motifs; S310 and H311 from motif Ia and residue P408 from motif III formed a conserved
pocket similar to the motif-Ia-pocket in the 1A domain of RecD2, which generally may accommodate a
DNA base. Residues T359, N361, and A362 from the loop between β18 and β19 were located at the
entrance of the ssDNA binding channel, near the 3’ end of the modeled ssDNA. The position of that
loop was equivalent to the pin device in RecD2 helicase, albeit far shorter in nsp13 and without forming
a rigid β-hairpin structure. The part from Y515 to N516, from the loop between β23 and α14, was
located at the 5’ end terminus of the modeled ssDNA. T532, D534, and S535 from motif V formed a
short helix below the phosphodiester backbone of the modeled ssDNA. Meanwhile, R560 from motif VI
was one of few residues that may interact with the base and sugar moiety of the ssDNA. R178 from the
1B domain interacted with the modeled ssDNA, which played a role in fixing ssDNA to the 1B, thus
causing a lag in unwinding, as according to our postulation (Fig. 5). The conserved threonine pair (i.e.,
with one threonine on each RecA-like domain) appeared in the structurally characterized SF1A helicases
(i.e., Rep, UvrD and PcrA), SF1B helicase (RecD2), and SF2 helicase; HCV NS3 is also available in
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV nsp13 helicases, T359 and T532. The threonine pair served as the
reference point for understand the translocation mechanism, such that when ATP was bound to a
helicase, the threonine residues were 2 nt apart, and when ATP was absent, they were 3 nt apart (16).
That finding supports the widely accepted theory of 1-nt translocation coupling to 1 ATP hydrolysis. In
our nsp13-ssDNA model representing the ATP-absent situation, the threonine pair is shown to be 3 nt
apart, which also supports the theory. In that light, determining the structures of nsp13 DNA and RNA
in the presence and absence of NTP or its analogues would contribute critical validation to the theory.

Using smFRET, we evaluated the unwinding rate of those mutants, except for R178D and R560D due to
insolubility, and compared them to the wild-type (WT) level. Most mutations were detrimental to the
unwinding activity (Fig. 4C). Compared with the WT nsp13, the loss in unwinding rate of S310D,
A362D, P408D, and Y515D was extremely significant (p < .005), while the rates of H311D, N516D,
and S535D were also significant (p < .01), whereas the rates of T359D, N361D, T532D, and D534A
were not. The significant loss of activity caused by residue substitutions seems to reflect their vital role
in unwinding. For example, residue P408 constituted one side of a pocket formed between motif Ia and
III on the RecA1 domain. Designated “motif Ia pocket,” that pocket has been shown to play a vital role
in DNA translocation, not only in SF1B helicase RecD2 (13) but also in the SF1A helicase, PcrA
(17,18). During ssDNA translocation, a DNA base occupies the motif Ia pocket of RecD2, which acts as
a physical block to grasp DNA while the 2A and 2B domains slip past. Because MERS-CoV nsp13
employs a similar mechanism, P408D mutation might have disrupted the hydrophobic interaction
between DNA base and the motif Ia pocket, hence the impaired DNA translocation. Residue A362 is
located on a loop between β18 and β19 at the entrance of the nucleic acid binding channel, where the
ssDNA–dsDNA juncture is supposed to bind. Overlapping with the RecD2 structure, the equivalent
region of the β18-to- β19 loop in RecD2 is a so-called “pin domain” functioning as a rigid device to split
open the DNA–RNA duplex. Because A362 may engage in opening duplexes, its substitution by an
aspartate might have hindered duplex separation instead of DNA translocation.

Discussion
Available biochemical and structural evidence support a translocation model of CoV nsp13 in line with
the canonical 5’-to-3’ translocation mechanism proposed for SF1B helicase (13). Nevertheless, prior to
our study, the duplex-unwinding mechanism by nsp13 remained to be understood. Some helicases,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.233510; this version posted August 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

including RecD2, RecG, and Hel308a (13,19,20), position a rigid pin or wedge device at the juncture of
ssDNA–dsDNA to split open base pairs; however, CoV nsp13 lacks such device, or else the part
exerting the analogous function within nsp13 has not been identified. Rao and colleagues reported a
β19-to-β20 loop in SARS-CoV nsp13 equivalent to a β17-to-β18 loop in MERS-CoV nsp13, which
hosts a handful of conserved, positively charged residues (e.g., Arg and Lys). They demonstrated that
although that region is critical to nsp13-catalyzed unwinding activity, the loop only partially binds to the
dsDNA substrate, not ssDNA alone. Revealing that region’s role in the unwinding process thus requires
further study, especially to determine the structures of nsp13–dsDNA and nsp13–RNA complexes.

Our smFRET experiment clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV nsp13-catalyzed dsDNA unwinding
(i.e., an 18-bp partial duplex) has a discrete step size of 9 bp in the presence of ATP and from 4 to 5 bp
when other NTP was used, which indicates the presence of a lag in unwinding. That result aligns
exceedingly well with the findings of an ensemble study (14), in which researchers, using a Rapid
Chemical Quench Flow instrument, estimated that SARS-CoV nsp13 unwinds dsDNA with discrete
steps of 9.3 bp and a catalytic rate is 30 steps per second. The lag in duplex unwinding is reminiscent of
the spring-loaded unwinding mechanism of the HCV NS3 helicase (HCV NS3-Hel) (21). HCV NS3
contains an aromatic residue W501 stacking against the 3’ terminus base of DNA, thereby fixing the
DNA to the D3 domain. While two RecA-like D1 and D2 domains of the NS3-Hel translocate in the
direction of 3’ to 5’ along DNA, the interaction between the D3 and DNA causes a lag in duplex
unwinding. When the tension builds up to a breaking point, a sudden movement of D3 occurs with a
concomitant burst of 3-bp unwinding.

We postulate that the 1B domain of CoV nsp13 may play a role similar to that of the D3 of NS3-Hel,
albeit with the different mechanism. In our modeled structures of MERS-CoV nsp13 and SARS-CoV-2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.233510; this version posted August 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

nsp13 bound by ssDNA (9), the 1B domain and the RecA1 domain sandwich the 3’ portion of ssDNA.
While the motif Ia pocket contacts the DNA on one side, the conserved residues 178R to 179N of the 1B
domain contact the DNA on the other side. Fueled by the energy from NTP hydrolysis, the RecA1 and
RecA2 translocate forward in a direction from 5’ to 3’, whereas the 1B remains fixed with the DNA. In
contrast to the D3 of NS3-Hel, the 1B domain is distantly connected to the body of the helicase core via
a rather long (i.e., approx. 20 Å) stalk domain. That unusually flexible architecture allows considerably
greater interdomain rearrangement, thus the 1B–DNA interaction may survive the lagging at greater than
4 nt behind the translocating RecA1 and RecA2 domains.

Because SARS-CoV nsp13 and MERS nsp13 exhibit unmistakable similarity in structure (Cα rmsd =
1.7 Å) and because SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is nearly identical to SARS-CoV nsp13, the mechanism
underlying the unwinding should be well preserved in all three nsp13 helicases. However, we discovered
a notable difference at the hinge region (i.e., 438–445aa) between the RecA1 and RecA2 domains of
nsp13. That hinge mediates their open-and-close rotation, which is essential to NTP hydrolysis and
ssDNA translocation (12); thus, the flexibility of the hinge governs the activity of nsp13. MERS-CoV
nsp13 contains residue S439 on the hinge, which is replaced by G439 in both SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 and
SARS-CoV nsp13. Because glycine allows a wider range of dihedral angles than all non-glycine
residues, the rotation between the RecA1 and RecA2 domains of SARS-CoV nsp13 and SARS-CoV-2
nsp13 is more flexible and may thus confer higher enzymatic activity. To test that hypothesis, we
compared the NTPase turnover rate of MERS-CoV nsp13 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in an NTPase
experiment with malachite green (Fig. 6). We performed our assays by using same enzyme
concentration (i.e., 50 nM) and substrate concentration (i.e., 125 μM), and both nsp13 helicases lacked
affinity tags. Similar to MERS-CoV nsp13, SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 exhibited clear preference for ATP

hydrolysis over NTP and dNTP hydrolysis. As predicted, the turnover rate of MERS-CoV nsp13 was
significantly slower than that of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 for all NTP substrates, likely owing to their
different hinge regions. In the particular case of dTTP, the least preferred substrate, SARS-CoV-2 nsp13
showed 11.5-fold more hydrolysis activity than MERS-CoV nsp13. In the cases of ATP and CTP, the
turnover rates of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 were greater by 3.9- and 2.3-fold, respectively. How the different
NTP hydrolysis activities between MERS-CoV nsp13 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 correlate to nucleic acid
translocation and unwinding, however, requires future in-depth analysis at the single-molecule level.

Materials and Methods
Prepare of Partial Duple Oligonucleotides
Partial duplex DNA was annealed from an 18 bp single stranded DNA (Top Strand, 5’-CGA AGC TGC
TAA CAT CAG-3’-Cy5) and a 37 bp single stranded DNA (Bottom Strand, Biotin-5’-TTT TTT TTT
TTT TTT TTT TTT-Cy3-CTG ATG TTA GCA GCT TCG-3'), both ssDNA were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies. Shortly, 1 μL of 100 μM Top Strand and 1 μL of 400 μM Bottom strand
were mixed with 48 μL annealing buffer (containing 20 mM Tris Base, 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl),
0.2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.5) and incubated at 80 oC for 15 min and slowly
cool to room temperature. The annealed DNA was diluted to desired concentrations with T50 buffer
before use.

and PEG in order to eliminate nonspecific binding, as well as to generate biotin-NeutrAvidin bridges on
the surface. The biotin-PEG and mPEG-succinimidyl valerate were covalently immobilized onto the
slides surface according to the established protocol. Firstly, the slides were thoroughly cleaned with
household detergent and MilliQ water, and then sonicated subsequently in the MilliQ water, acetone
(Fisher Scientific, USA), 1 M potassium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, USA) and methanol (99.8%,
Fisher Scientific, USA) for 1 h each. Upon each sonication, the slides were thoroughly washed with
MilliQ water. After that each quartz slide were burnt with a propone torch for 2 min, and immersed into
the MilliQ water immediately. The slides were subsequently incubated in methanol containing with 1%
(v/v) 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma, USA) and 5% (v/v) acetone for 10 min, and then
incubated for another 10 min after 1 min sonication. Upon incubation, the slides were thoroughly
washed with MilliQ water and methanol and blow dry with air. After that 80 μL mixture of the 200
mg/mL methoxy-polyethylene glycol succinimidyl valerate and 36.67 mg/mL biotin-polyethylene glycol
succinimidyl valerate (m-PEG-SVA, biotin-PEG-SVA, Laysan Bio Inc, USA) was dropped onto the
treated quartz slides, and the cover slides was placed on the top of the quartz slides to form a chamber.
After that, the chamber was incubated in a wet box in dark over night at room temperature. Upon
incubation, the chamber was separate carefully and the surfaces were washed thoroughly with Milli Q
water then blow dry with air. The PEGylation process was repeated. The flow chamber was assembled
from the biotin-PEG coated quartz slide and a coverslip using double sided tape and Epoxy glue.

Immobilization of DNA and Helicase onto the Substrate
The partial duplex DNA was immobilized onto the substrate by the biotin-NuetrAvidin bridge, and the
helicase specifically bound to the junction of the ssDNA and dsDNA at the partial duplex DNA. Firstly,
50 µL of 0.1 mg/mL NeutrAvidin (Fisher Scientific, USA) was added into the channels and incubated

for 5 min at room temperature. Upon incubation, the unbound NeutrAvidin was washed out with 200 µL
T50 buffer for at least 3 times for each channel. Subsequently, 50 µL of 15 pM partial duplex DNA was
added into the channel and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Then any unbound DNA were
washed out with 200 µL T50 buffer for at least 3 times. After that, 50 µL of 20 nM helicase was injected
into the channel and incubated for another 10 min at room temperature. Upon incubation, 50 µL of
NTPs at different concentration in oxygen scavenger solution (0.1 mg/mL glucose oxidase (Sigma,
USA), 0.02 mg/mL catalase (Sigma, USA) and 0.8% (w/w) dextrose (sigma, USA), 3 mM 6 -hydroxy2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox, sigma, USA)) was injected into the channel. The
sample was imaged immediately after the NTPs injection.

Single-Molecule Imaging Through Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF)
The DNA unwinding events by the helicase were recorded with a homemade TIRF microscopy. The
detailed structure of the microscopy was reported before. Specifically, the Cy5 labeled sample was
excited by a 633 nm laser beam while the Cy3 labeled sample was excited by a 532 nm laser beam.
Videos were taken with 100 ms exposure time and 600 frames were recorded. Obtained data was
analyzed in real time using the custom software obtained from Dr. Taekjip Ha’s group at Johns Hopkins
University.
