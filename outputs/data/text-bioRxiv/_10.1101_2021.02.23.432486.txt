Abstract

80

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is generally milder than in adults, yet a proportion of cases

81

result in hyperinflammatory conditions often including myocarditis. To better understand these

82

cases, we applied a multi-parametric approach to the study of blood cells of 56 children

83

hospitalized with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most severe forms of MIS-C

84

(multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to SARS-CoV-2), that resulted in

85

myocarditis, were characterized by elevated levels of pro-angiogenesis cytokines and several

86

chemokines. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses identified a unique monocyte/dendritic cell

87

gene signature that correlated with the occurrence of severe myocarditis, characterized by

88

sustained NF-B activity, TNF- signaling, associated with decreased gene expression of NF-

89

B inhibitors. We also found a weak response to type-I and type-II interferons,

Introduction

95

In adults, critical forms of COVID-19 are typically characterized by severe pneumonia and

96

acute respiratory distress syndrome (Wiersinga et al., 2020). In children, symptomatic COVID-

97

19 occurs much less frequently and is milder than in adults, with multifactorial reasons for

98

these differences (Brodin, 2020; Castagnoli et al., 2020; Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Levy et al.,

99

2020; Tagarro et al., 2020). However, in regions with high incidence of SARS-CoV-2

100

infection, some children have presented a postacute hyperinflammatory illness (Datta et al.,

101

2020). In these cases, diagnostic evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection has been

102

consistently reported (Abrams et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020; Toubiana et al., 2020, 2021).

103

This condition was named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or

104

alternatively PIMS-TS (Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally

105

Associated with SARS-CoV-2)(Whittaker et al., 2020). MIS-C cases most often present with

106

symptoms similar to Kawasaki Disease (KD), an hyperinflammatory illness characterized by

107

clinical features such as strawberry-like tongue and red and dry lips, bulbar conjunctival

108

injection, diffuse rash, swollen extremities and cervical lymphadenopathy (McCrindle et al.,

109

2017). KD complications can develop as myocarditis or shock syndrome in a minority of cases

110

(Kanegaye et al., 2009). KD is thought to be triggered by viral or bacterial pathogens but the

111

precise pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, with one hypothesis proposing an

112

uncontrolled superantigen-driven inflammatory immune response (Chang et al., 2014).

113

Compared to classic KD, MIS-C occurs in patients who are older, have more often

114

gastrointestinal symptoms, myocarditis and shock syndrome, and exhibit higher levels of

115

inflammatory markers (Abrams et al., 2020; Datta et al., 2020; Toubiana et al., 2020, 2021).

116

Inflammatory features of MIS-C are in part overlapping with those of both KD and acute

117

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, as well as severe COVID-19 in adults (Carter et al., 2020;

118

Consiglio et al., 2020; Datta et al., 2020; Gruber et al., 2020). Very high levels of C-reactive

119

protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT) and IL-6, might reflect a strong immunological response

120

to a pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 superantigen (Cheng et al., 2020). Autoimmune features can also

121

be found in MIS-C patients (Gruber et al., 2020).

122

In order to further decipher SARS-CoV-2-related conditions in children, we have performed a

123

detailed multi-parametric study combining sensitive cytokine measurements, deep immune cell

124

phenotyping and transcriptomic analyses at the single-cell level on peripheral blood

125

mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Results

128

Clinical description of the cohort

129

The study cohort consisted of 56 children hospitalized during the first peak of the SARS-CoV-

130

2 pandemic (from the 6th of April to the 30th of May), and 34 healthy controls (N=26 pediatric

131

and N=8 adults recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic) (Figure 1, Table S1). Among the

132

13 children with acute respiratory infection (Table S1, Figure S1), 9 had a confirmed SARS-

133

CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab) (Acute-inf (CoV2+) group).

134

Six out of these 9 cases had pneumonia, and one had an uncomplicated febrile seizure. One

135

patient with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation for sickle cell disease, required

136

intensive care support. The 4 other patients (Acute-inf (CoV2-) group) had pneumonia

137

associated with a positive RT-PCR test for either Mycoplasma pneumoniae or

138

rhinovirus/enterovirus, and negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

139

Forty-three children displayed features of postacute hyperinflammatory illness (Figure S1,

140

Table S1). SARS-CoV-2 infection status of all samples was confirmed by specific antibody

141

determination (both IgG and IgA) in the plasma, using ELISA and flow cytometry-based

142

technics as described in the methods (Figure S2A). Most (n=30) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-

143

2 infection (with 14 also positive for concomitant nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing) and were

144

therefore considered as cases of MIS-C (MIS-C (CoV2+) group); all 30 cases of MIS-C

145

presented clinical features of KD, 14 of them fulfilled clinical criteria for a complete form of

146

KD according to the American Heart Association (McCrindle et al., 2017). Of note, 21/30 cases

147

had severe myocarditis (i.e. with elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and/or regional

148

wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, and clinical signs of circulatory failure

149

requiring intensive care support; MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)). Thirteen tested negative for SARS-

150

CoV-2 and fulfilled clinical criteria for complete (n=6) or incomplete (n=7) Kawasaki disease

151

(KD), and were therefore considered to have KD-like illness (KD (CoV2-) group) (Figure S1,

152

Table S1). Clinical and biological characteristics, at time of disease activity and before

153

treatment, or within 24 hours of treatment onset, are presented in Table S1. MIS-C cases had

154

low lymphocyte counts and those with severe myocarditis had in addition abnormally increased

155

neutrophil counts as compared to other groups, along with high levels of CRP, PCT, serum

156

alanine transaminases (ALT) and ferritin (Table S1). All cases responded favorably to

157

intravenous immunoglobulin injections (IVIG), some (N=12, Table S1) in combination with

158

glucocorticosteroids, received before sampling. Multi-parametric analyses were performed at

159

a median fever persistence of 9-10 days (Figures 1A, B).

Elevated inflammatory cytokine levels in pediatric acute infection and
postacute hyperinflammatory conditions

163

We investigated plasma cytokine and chemokine levels in all patients, by Luminex and Simoa

164

assays. Hierarchical clustering analysis and stratification by patient groups revealed overall

165

elevated levels of immune and inflammatory markers, with 40/46 measured proteins

166

significantly elevated (q<0.05) as compared to healthy controls (Figure 2A; global heat map).

167

Twelve cytokines were found to be elevated in all groups of patients as compared to healthy

168

controls (Figure S2B). High IL-8 and CXCL1 (Figure S2C) were more specific to children

169

with acute infection. Cytokine levels did not significantly differ between children with acute

170

infection with or without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures S2D-F). IFN, IFN2,

171

IL-17A, TNF-, IL-10, Granzyme B, were higher in children with postacute

172

hyperinflammation (MIS-C (CoV2+), MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+), and KD (CoV2-) groups), as

173

compared to pediatric healthy donors (CTL) and patients with acute infections (Acute-inf

174

(CoV2+) and Acute-inf (CoV2-) (Figure 2A, top cluster and 2B). A slightly higher expression

175

of IFN2 and IL-17A was found in MIS-C without myocarditis (MIS-C (CoV-2+) patients).

176

(Figure 2C). In contrast, 11 cytokines and chemokines (CSF2, CCL2, IL-6, CXCL10, FLT3L,

177

VEGF, TGF-A, IL-1RA, PD-L1, CX3CL1, TGF-B1) were higher in MIS-C with severe

178

myocarditis (MIS-C_MYO (CoV-2+)) (Figures 2 C, D). Of note, 8 of them are known to be

179

associated with TNF- signaling. They are involved in propagation of inflammation (IL-6, IL-

180

15), angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis (VEGF and TGF cytokines) and activation and

181

chemotaxis of myeloid cells (CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10) (Figure 2D) (Holbrook et al., 2019;

182

Varfolomeev and Ashkenazi, 2004). An increased level of CCL19, CCL20, CCL3 (cell

183

migration and chemotaxis) and IL-1 agonist/antagonist (IL-1, IL-1RA) were also observed,

184

as well as increased soluble PD-L1 (Figure S2G). Another noticeably elevated cytokine was

185

CSF2, known to be involved in myeloid cell differentiation and migration (Figure 2D).

186

Altogether, high inflammatory cytokine levels were detected in both acute infection and

187

postacute inflammatory cases. The strongest inflammatory profile was observed in MIS-C with

188

severe myocarditis (MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)) and remarkably, a similar profile was observed

189

when comparing MIS-C without myocarditis (MIS-C (CoV2+)) and KD-like illness unrelated

190

to SARS-CoV-2 (KD (CoV2-)). Of note, the inflammatory profile was much reduced in

191

intensity in MIS-C cases with myocarditis under combined glucocorticosteroid and IVIG

192

treatment, as compared to IVIG alone (Figure S2H).

193
194
195

Low monocyte and dendritic cell frequencies in patients with postacute
hyperinflammatory illness

196

To better decipher the blood immune cell composition of each group, PBMCs were analyzed

197

by CyTOF mass spectrometry and by single-cell analyses at the transcriptomic level (SC-RNA-

198

SEQ) (Figure 1). Clustering analyses of the data obtained from CyTOF and SC-RNA-SEQ

199

revealed consistent results, with most of the alterations observed in clusters composed of

200

monocytes or dendritic cells (Figures 3A, B; S3 A-D). The most drastic changes were a

201

decrease in conventional Dendritic Cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs) in

202

patients with a postacute hyperinflammatory illness ((MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+), MIS-C (CoV2+)

203

and KD (CoV2-)). As previously reported (Gruber et al., 2020), we also observed a trend

204

towards a decrease in monocyte clusters in children with postacute hyperinflammatory illness,

205

that was found independent of SARS-CoV-2 status (Figures 3A, B; S3 A-D). Of note, some

206

heterogeneity was observed in the proportions of non-classical monocytes in Acute-Inf (CoV2+)

207

cases. We observed additional heterogeneity in the proportions of classical and intermediate

208

monocytes in patients with severe myocarditis (MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) (Figures 3A, B), but

209

there was no correlation with clinical data (Table S1), nor cytokine/chemokine measurements

210

(Figures 2 and S2). Additional modifications were detected in patients with acute SARS-CoV-

211

2 infection (Acute-inf (CoV2+) cases), consisting of a decrease of MAIT cells and an excess of

212

naïve and central memory CD4+ T cells (Figures 3 A, B, S3 C, D).

213
214
215
216

Overexpression of inflammatory pathways, NF-B signaling, and metabolic
changes related to hypoxia in acute infection and postacute
hyperinflammatory conditions

217

To gain further insight into the mechanisms behind the different forms of SARS-CoV-2

218

infection in children, we assessed pathways modulated in each group by looking at the

219

differentially expressed genes, obtained from the SC-RNA-SEQ dataset. In patients with acute

220

infection (Acute-inf (CoV2+) and Acute-inf (CoV2-)), the numbers of differentially expressed

221

genes were homogeneously distributed among monocytes/DCs, T and B cells (Figures 4A and

222

S4A). Pathway enrichment analyses (Ingenuity Pathway Analyses; IPA, QIAGEN Inc.)

223

revealed a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, coupled with an increase of HMGB1

224

signaling, HIF-1 signaling, and hypoxia signaling. Production of nitric oxide was observed

225

in both groups of acute infections, independently of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as compared to

226

healthy controls (Figure S4B). These observations suggest a metabolic switch potentially

227

driven by hypoxic conditions. NF-B signaling, VEGF signaling and inflammatory pathways

228

(type-I and type-II IFNs, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-17 signaling pathways) were also found to be

229

overrepresented in both groups of patients (Figure S4B).

230

Interestingly, alterations in the same pathways were also identified in all cases of children with

231

SARS-CoV-2-related postacute illnesses (All MIS-C (CoV2+): MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) and MIS-

232

C (CoV2+)). However, in these cases, alterations were mostly restricted to monocytes and

233

dendritic cells (Figures 4 A, B). Comparisons of genes differentially expressed between

234

children with postacute hyperinflammatory illness with or without evidence of SARS-CoV-2

235

infection (All MIS-C (CoV2+) versus KD (CoV2-)), did not reveal significant differences with

236

the exception of type-I and type-II interferon signaling (Figures S4 C, D).

237

The NF-B signaling pathway was identified to be activated in monocytes and DCs of all

238

patients with acute infection and postacute hyperinflammatory illness, independently of SARS-

239

CoV-2 infection (Figure 5A). While monocytes and DCs of patients with acute infection

240

(Acute-inf (CoV2+) and Acute-inf (CoV2-)) highly expressed genes of the NF-B complex

241

(REL, RELA, RELB, NFKB1, NFKB2; Figures 5B, D), monocytes and DCs from all MIS-C

242

patients (MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) and MIS-C (CoV2+)) exhibited a strong decrease in the

243

expression of NF-B inhibitors, such as TNFAIP3 (A20), TNFAIP2, NFKBIA, NFKBID,

244

NFKBIE and NFKBIZ (Figures 5C, D). Strikingly, this decrease in the expression of NF-B

245

inhibitors appeared to be specific to the monocytes and DCs of MIS-C patients with severe

246

myocarditis (MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)) (Figures 5 E, S5 A-D).

247

In conclusion, pathways dysregulated in acute infection or postacute hyperinflammatory

248

illness, reflected an inflammatory status based on NF-B signaling combined with changes in

249

metabolism driven by a hypoxic environment. In acute respiratory disease, changes in gene

250

expression reflected involvement of all PBMCs, whereas in postacute hyperinflammatory

251

illnesses, monocytes/DCs were the most affected populations. These results further emphasize

252

the role of monocytes/DCs populations in MIS-C.

253
254

Molecular pathways specific to MIS-C with severe myocarditis

255

To gain further insight into the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes and DCs from MIS-C

256

patients, we compared gene expression between MIS-C patients with or without severe

257

myocarditis and healthy controls. Most gene alterations happened in monocytes/DCs (Figure

258

S6A and S6C), which lead us to focus on these populations for the following analyses.

259

Pathway enrichment performed both on IPA and EnrichR (Chen et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al.,

260

2016) highlighted the modulation of type-I and type-II interferon signaling pathways, with the

261

upregulation of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (JAK2, STAT1, STAT2, IFITM1,

IFITM2, IFI35, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, IRF1) only in the monocytes and DCs of MIS-C patients

263

without myocarditis (Figures 6 A, B, S6 B, D). However, both groups of MIS-C patients

264

showed elevated plasma IFN-2 and IFN proteins (Figures 2A, B). Gene expression

265

downregulation in monocytes and DCs of MIS-C patients with severe myocarditis, included

266

most of the MHC class II genes suggesting a decrease in antigen processing and presentation

267

pathways (Figures 6 C and S6D).

268

Transcription factor prediction in EnrichR revealed overexpression of targets of the NF-B

269

complex in MIS-C patients with severe myocarditis as compared to MIS-C without myocarditis

270

(Figure S6E). This activation of NF-B signaling in MIS-C patients with severe myocarditis

271

was found to be associated with the strong downregulation of NF-B inhibitors as shown in

272

Figure 5E.

273

A strong overexpression of genes belonging to TNF- signaling, as well as inflammatory

274

responses, hypoxia and response to oxidative stress (HIF1A, HMOX1, HMBG1, etc.) was found

275

in cases with severe myocarditis (Figures 6D, E and S6E). This was associated with a

276

downregulation of genes linked with oxidative phosphorylation, nitric oxide production and

277

iNOS signaling (Figure S6B). TGF- signaling and VEGF signaling were also found enriched

278

in monocytes and DCs of patients with myocarditis and to a lesser magnitude in B cells

279

(Figures S6 B, E). Interestingly, an increased expression of several genes encoding S100

280

proteins and calcium-binding cytosolic proteins, all known to serve as danger signals to

281

regulate cell migration, homeostasis and inflammation, were noticed in the cases of severe

282

myocarditis (Figure S6F) (Xia et al., 2018).

283

To summarize, NF-B activation, a decreased expression of NF-B inhibitors, TNF-

284

signaling, together with a hypoxic response to oxidative stress, VEGF signaling,

285

downregulation of MHC-II genes and low type-I and type-II IFN responses characterize the

286

monocytes and DCs of children with MIS-C and severe myocarditis.

Identification of a molecular signature specific to MIS-C with severe
myocarditis

289

To identify a potential clinical relevance of our study, we searched for a molecular signature

290

that correlated with the appearance of severe myocarditis among the monocytes/DCs of

291

children with SARS-CoV-2-related MIS-C. By using several SC-RNA-SEQ comparison

292

strategies (Figure 7A), we identified 329 genes upregulated in monocytes and DCs of the MIS-

293

C group with myocarditis (N=6) as compared to all other groups (Figure 7A). To validate this

294

molecular signature, RNA from PBMCs were sequenced from an independent group of

295

patients. A scoring system was generated, based on normalized expression represented by a Z-

296

score, coupled with hierarchical clustering, in order to identify genes that were overexpressed

297

in children with myocarditis (MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group) as compared to the other groups

298

(Figure S7A). Within the 329 genes identified by SC-RNA-SEQ in monocytes and DCs of

299

patients with severe myocarditis, expression of 116 genes were found upregulated in PBMCs

300

from an independent group of 9 patients belonging to the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group with

301

myocarditis (Figures 7B). From these genes, a signature score (SignatureSCORE) was

302

determined for each sample processed by Bulk-RNA-SEQ (Figure 7C). We then further

303

developed a RankingSCORE (Figures S7 A, B) to identify the top genes that contributed the

304

most to the monocytes and DCs myocarditis signature. This led to the identification of a set of

305

25 genes that clearly segregate patients with severe myocarditis from other MIS-C and KD

306

(CoV2-) (Figure 7D). Consistently, most of these 25 genes belong to functional pathways that

307

were previously identified (Figures 6 and S6), such as inflammation, oxidative stress, TNF-

308

and/or NF-B signaling, and in some cases already known markers of myocarditis or MIS-C

309

and/or COVID-19, such as genes coding for S100 proteins (Figures S7 C, D).

Discussion

311

Multi-parametric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with acute

312

respiratory infection and postacute hyperinflammation, collected during the COVID-19

313

pandemic, allowed to detect an inflammatory profile associated with a loss of circulating

314

monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as an upregulation of genes and pathways

315

involving NF-B signaling, oxidative stress with establishment of hypoxic conditions and

316

VEGF signaling. These pathways were upregulated in both acute and postacute groups of

317

patients, independently of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, significant features of MIS-C

318

with severe myocarditis were detected specifically in monocytes and DCs including low type-

319

I and type-II IFN responses, decreased expression of NF-kB inhibitors, increased TNF-

320

signaling and overexpression of HIF-1.

321

Acute cases were characterized by the detection of inflammatory markers in the plasma with a

322

particularly strong elevation of IL-8 and CXCL1, two chemokines known to mediate neutrophil

323

migration to the lung (Kunkel et al., 1991; Pease and Sabroe, 2002; Sawant et al., 2015) and a

324

modest elevation of IFN2 levels. These findings suggest that in some children, a suboptimal

325

anti-viral type-I interferon response, alongside a hyperinflammatory response (IL-6 levels and

326

exacerbation of the NF-kB pathway), could account for SARS-CoV-2 disease with pneumonia,

327

as compared to the very usual benign or even asymptomatic clinical course of SARS-CoV-2

328

infection in children. This has been previously observed in severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus

329

(RSV) infections (Hijano et al., 2019).

330

In the postacute patients, elevated levels of plasma IFN-, IFN2, IL-10, IL-15, and, to a lesser

331

extent, TNF-, were found, as previously described in other cohorts (Brodsky et al., 2020;

332

Carter et al., 2020; Consiglio et al., 2020; Esteve-Sole et al., 2021; Gruber et al., 2020). These

333

findings are typical of an ongoing anti-viral immune response, not directly related to SARS-

334

CoV-2 infection. In addition, elevated chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4 may recruit

335

monocytes and DCs to tissues, possibly accounting for their reduced numbers observed in the

336

blood of those patients. Additional mechanisms such as apoptosis or other cell death pathways

337

may also be involved.

338

Cellular phenotypes that distinguish MIS-C from classical KD have been previously reported

339

(Brodsky et al., 2020; Consiglio et al., 2020; Esteve-Sole et al., 2021). Brodin and colleagues

340

described several key differences such as elevated IL-17, IL-6 and CXCL10 that were only

341

observed in KD, associated with decreased naïve CD4+ T cells and increased central memory

342

and effector memory CD4+ T cells in MIS-C. In the present study, high levels of IL-17, IL-6

343

and CXCL10, were both found in MIS-C and KD (CoV2-) groups. In addition, no major

344

differences in CD4+ T cell compartments were detected. Accordingly, only a few differentially

345

expressed genes were found between the MIS-C and KD (CoV2-) groups. These data support

346

the hypothesis that MIS-C patients with KD features exhibit a molecular phenotype close to

347

the one seen in KD patients, suggesting overlapping pathogenesis mechanisms (Gruber et al.,

348

2020). Differences observed with previous reports by Brodin and colleagues, may be due to

349

inclusion of only patients with criteria for complete or incomplete KD among the MIS-C cases,

350

or technical differences in the respective studies, such as time of blood sampling relative to

351

admission to hospital and medical treatments.

352

However, we did find noticeable differences in MIS-C cases with severe myocarditis with

353

circulatory failure that required intensive care. The expression of a number of cytokines was

354

further increased in these cases, most of them related to the NF-B-TNF- signaling axis.

355

Elevated VEGF and TGF- and TGF- are potential drivers of angiogenesis and vascular

356

homeostasis, whereas elevated chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CX3CL1, CXCL10) could

357

mediate increased cell migration towards inflamed tissues. Molecular analysis confirmed an

358

upregulation of genes belonging to the TNF- and NF-B signaling pathways that were

359

specifically found in monocytes and DCs of MIS-C patients with severe myocarditis. A lower

360

expression of NF-B complex inhibitors, including TNFAIP3 (A20), TNFAIP2, NFKBIA,

361

NFKBIZ, was detected, suggesting a possible mechanism for NF-B sustained activation which

362

could then potentially lead to exacerbated TNF- signaling. Overall, these results point to a

363

potential role of monocytes and DCs in the pathogenesis of MIS-C with severe myocarditis,

364

which might not be directly driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but rather due to a tolerance

365

defect in limiting a pathological immune response, as already observed for other pathogens

366

(Goodnow, 2021). It would be interesting to investigate the presence of genetic variants among

367

MIS-C with severe myocarditis, in genes such as TNFAIP3, as already discussed (Goodnow,

368

2021). The apparent hypoxic conditions detected in children with myocarditis, could also

369

account for the exacerbation of NF-B signaling. HIF-1, a sensor of oxidative stress, is well-

370

known for being able to induce a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis to limit

371

generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It can also activate NF-B signaling (D’Ignazio

372

and Rocha, 2016; D’Ignazio et al., 2016). Additional environmental factors and/or genetic

373

predispositions could also be involved. Another striking feature was the low expression of

374

genes involved in type-I and type-II interferon responses, specifically in monocytes and DCs

375

of children with myocarditis, although IFN- and IFN2 proteins were elevated in the plasma

376

of all MIS-C patients. This reduced response to type-I IFN in the most severe forms of MIS-C

377

(with myocarditis and circulatory failure) is in part reminiscent of the impaired type-I IFN

378

activity observed in the most severe forms of COVID-19 in adults (Bastard et al., 2020; Hadjadj

379

et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The search for auto-antibodies against IFN2 were negative

380

(data not shown) but presence of autoantibodies to ISGs (interferon stimulated genes) cannot

381

be excluded (Combes et al., 2021).

382

Overall, our findings depict a model, supported by previous publications (Amoah et al., 2015;

383

Calabrese et al., 2004; Mann Douglas L., 2001), in which myocarditis is associated with an

384

attenuated negative feedback loop of TNF--driven NF-B activation, together with an excess

385

of proangiogenic cytokines and chemokines that could attract activated myeloid and T cells to

386

the myocardium tissue (Figure S8). Locally, it could lead to the production of inflammatory

387

cytokines known to promote differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiac myofibroblasts

388

(TNF-, TGF-, IL1-, IL-13, IL-4, VEGF). Cardiac myofibroblasts, as previously reported,

389

may secrete chemokines leading to further activation and recruitment of myeloid cells, creating

390

a feed-forward loop of locally sustained inflammation and myocarditis (Figure S8) (Amoah et

391

al., 2015; Angelo and Kurzrock, 2007; Delprat et al., 2020; Hua Xiumeng et al., 2020; Maloney

392

and Gao, 2015).

393

Using SC-RNA-SEQ data, we defined a gene signature specific of SARS-CoV-2-related

394

postacute hyperinflammatory illness with severe myocarditis that was further validated by a

395

global transcriptomic analysis on PBMCs from an independent patient group. The genes

396

defining this signature were consistently enriched in genes associated with inflammation, TNF-

397

 and NF-B signaling, oxidative stress and myocarditis (Figure S7C). Interestingly, among

398

these genes, the S100 proteins and the calprotectin complex (S100A8/S100A9) in particular,

399

were previously reported and proposed as biomarkers for the most severe adult form of

400

COVID-19 with acute respiratory syndrome (Figure S7D) (Silvin et al., 2020).

401

Our study has several limitations, including the relatively low number of cases in each group,

402

the lack of a comparison with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized children

403

positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a longitudinal study of children with “classic” KD enrolled

404

before the COVID-19 pandemic. All our cellular data were generated from frozen peripheral

405

mononuclear cells, which does not allow a direct assessment of neutrophils. A parallel analysis

406

of PMN (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) will be required. Endothelial and myocardiac cells

407

are at least targets of the disease but may also contribute to the pathophysiology as described

408

above. Also, additional data supporting gene expression findings will be necessary in future

409

studies. Nevertheless, our study provides further in-depth molecular analysis of MIS-C with

410

severe myocarditis. These severe forms were found to be associated with an excessive

411

activation of the TNF-, NF-B signaling axis and poor response to type-I and type-II

412

interferons in monocytes and DCs, secretion of cytokines promoting angiogenesis, chemotaxis

413

and potential migration of activated myeloid cells and neutrophils in the myocardiac tissue.

414

This may help to identify potential new clinical biomarkers and open new therapeutic

415

strategies, including drugs targeting TNF- or NF-B pathways.

Patients and definitions

432

This prospective multicenter cohort study included children (age ≤ 18 years at the time of

433

admission) suspected of infection with SARS-CoV-2 between April 6, 2020 and May 30, 2020.

434

Clinical aspects of 22 of the included patients were previously reported (Toubiana et al., 2020,

435

2021). Children admitted with fever in general pediatric wards or pediatric intensive care units

436

of Tertiary French hospitals involved in the research program, suspected of SARS-CoV-2

437

related illness and who underwent routine nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

438

(R-GENE, Argene, Biomerieux, Marcy l’Etoile) or SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing

439

(Architect SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay; Abbott Core

440

Laboratory, IL, USA), were eligible. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (Comité

441

de Protection des Personnes Ouest IV, n° DC-2017-2987). All parents provided written

442

informed consent.

443

Case definition for pediatric COVID-19 acute infection was presence of fever, fatigue,

444

neurological abnormalities, gastro-intestinal or respiratory signs, associated with a concomitant

445

nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and absence of MIS-C criteria

446

(Zimmermann and Curtis, 2020). Case definition for postacute hyperinflammatory illness

447

(Figure 1) was presence of fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation and clinically severe

448

illness with multisystem involvement, during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period (Datta et al.,

449

2020). This may include children with features of KD; criteria of the American Heart

450

Association was used to define for complete (Fever > 4 days and ≥ 4 principal criteria) or

451

incomplete KD (Fever > 4 days and 2 or 3 principal criteria, and without characteristics

452

suggestive of another diagnosis) (McCrindle et al., 2017). Among cases with postacute

453

hyperinflammatory illness, children with a positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (RT-PCR or

454

serology) were considered to have MIS-C according to CDC and WHO criteria to define MIS-

455

C (CDC, 2020). Patients with postacute hyperinflammatory illness, negative SARS-CoV-2

456

testing (RT-PCR or serology), and criteria for KD, were considered as patients with KD-like

457

illness. Patients with MIS-C with clinical signs of circulatory failure requiring intensive care,

458

with elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels (>26 ng/mL) and /or decreased cardiac

459

function (diastolic or systolic ventricular dysfunction at echocardiography), were considered

460

to have MIS-C with severe myocarditis (Brissaud et al., 2016; Canter Charles E. and Simpson

461

Kathleen E., 2014).

462

For each included patient, we collected demographic data, symptoms, results of SARS-CoV-2

463

testing and other laboratory tests, echocardiograms, and treatments. All patients with negative

464

initial serology testing were retested after an interval of at least 3 weeks (Architect SARS-CoV-

465

2 chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay; Abbott Core Laboratory).

466

Healthy controls were recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (before November 2019).

Samples

469

For each patient and healthy donor, peripheral blood samples were collected on EDTA and

470

lithium heparin tubes. After a centrifugation of the EDTA tube at 2300rpm for 10 minutes,

471

plasma was taken and stored at -80°C before cytokine quantification. PBMCs were isolated

472

from the lithium heparin samples, frozen as described below and stored at -80°C and were used

473

for both bulk and single-cell RNAseq, as well as cell phenotyping by CyTOF. The workflow

474

is summarized in Figure 1B.

475
476

Isolation of PBMCs

477

Peripheral blood samples were collected on lithium heparin. PBMCs were isolated by density

478

gradient centrifugation (2200 rpm without break for 30 minutes) using Ficoll (Eurobio

479

Scientific, Les Ulis, France). After centrifugation, cells were washed with Phosphate-buffered

480

saline (PBS) (Thermo Fisher scientific, Illkirch, France). The pellet was resuspended in PBS

481

and cells were centrifuged at 1900 rpm for 5 minutes. Finally, the PBMCs pellet was frozen in

482

a medium containing 90% of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher scientific,

483

Illkirch, France) and 10% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Quentin

484

Fallavier, France).

486

Cytokine measurements

487

Prior to protein analysis plasma samples were treated in a BSL3 laboratory for viral

488

decontamination using a protocol previously described for SARS-CoV (Darnell and Taylor,

489

2006), which we validated for SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, samples were treated with TRITON

490

X100 (TX100) 1% (v/v) for 2hrs at Room Temperature. IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-17A, (triplex) and

491

IFNβ (single plex) protein plasma concentrations were quantified by Simoa assays developed

492

with Quanterix Homebrew kits as previously described (Rodero et al., 2017). The limit of

493

detection of these assays were 0.6 pg/mL for IFNβ, 2 fg/mL for IFNα2, 0.05 pg/ml for IFNγ

494

and 3 pg/mL for IL17A including the dilution factor. IL-6, TNFα, and IL-10 were measured

495

with a commercial triplex assay (Quanterix). Additional plasma cytokines and chemokines (44

496

analytes) were measured with a commercial Luminex multi-analyte assay (Biotechne, R&D

497

systems).

498
499

Serology assays

500

SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were quantified using assays previously described (Grzelak

501

et al., 2020). Briefly, a standard ELISA assay using as target antigens the extracellular domain

502

of the S protein in the form of a trimer (ELISA tri-S) and the S-Flow assay, which is based on

503

the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed on the surface of 293T cells (293T-S),

504

were used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA subtypes in plasma. Assay

505

characteristics including sensitivity and specificity were previously described (Grzelak et al.,

506

2020).

508

Cell Phenotyping

509

To perform high-dimensional immune profiling of PBMCs, we used the Maxpar® Direct™

510

Immune Profiling System (Fluidigm, Inc France) with a 30-marker antibody panel, for CyTOF

511

(Cytometry by Time Of Flight). Briefly, 3x106 PBMCs resuspended in 300 µl of MaxPar Cell

512

Staining Buffer were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature after addition of 3 μL of

513

10 KU/mL heparin solution and 5 µl of Human TruStain FcX (Biolegend Europ, Netherland).

514

Then 270 L of the samples were directly added to the dry antibody cocktail for 30 minutes. 3

515

mL of MaxPar Water was added to each tube for an additional 10-min incubation. Three

516

washes were performed on all the samples using MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer and they were

517

fixed using 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, France). After one wash with MaxPar

518

Cell Staining Buffer, cells were incubated one hour in Fix and Perm Buffer with 1:1000 of

519

Iridium intercalator (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl‐Ir (III)‐dipyridophenazine, Fluidigm, Inc

520

France). Cells were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells per mL in

521

Maxpar Cell Acquisition Solution, a high-ionic-strength solution, and mixed with 10% of EQ

522

Beads immediately before acquisition.

523

Acquisition of the events was made on the Helios mass cytometer and CyTOF software version

524

6.7.1014 (Fluidigm, Inc Canada) at the “Plateforme de Cytométrie de la Pitié‐Salpetriere

525

(CyPS).” An average of 500,000 events were acquired per sample. Dual count calibration,

526

noise reduction, cell length threshold between 10 and 150 pushes, and a lower convolution

527

threshold equal to 10 were applied during acquisition. Mass cytometry standard files produced

528

by the HELIOS were normalized using the CyTOF Software v. 6.7.1014. For data cleaning, 4

529

parameters (centre, offset, residual and width) are used to resolve ion fusion events (doublets)

530

from single events from the Gaussian distribution generated by each event (Bagwell et al.,

531

2020). Subsequent to data cleaning, the program produces new FCS files consisting of only

532

intact live singlet cells. These data were analyzed in FlowJo v10.7.1 using 3 plugins

533

(DownSampleV3, UMAP and FlowSOM) with R v4.0.2. To increase efficiency of the analysis,

534

samples were downsampled to 50 000 cells, using the DownSample V3 plugin. All samples

535

were concatenated and analyzed in an unsupervised manner. Anti-CD127 antibody had to be

536

excluded due to poor staining. Clustering was performed using FlowSOM (Van Gassen et al.,

537

2015). The number of clusters was set to forty-five in order to overestimate the populations

538

and detect smaller subpopulations. Grid size of the self-organizing map was set to 20x20.

539

Resulting clusters were annotated as cell populations following the kit manufacturer’s

540

instruction. When several clusters were identified as the same cell types, they were

541

concatenated into a single cell population. For visualization purposes, UMAP was computed

with the UMAP pluggin (McInnes et al.) with the following parameters: metric (Euclidean),

543

nearest neighbors (15), minimum distance (0.5) and number of components (2).

544
545

Single-cell transcriptomic (SC-RNA-SEQ)

546

SC-RNA-SEQ analyses were performed on frozen PBMCs isolated from heparin blood

547

samples. PBMCs were thawed according to 10X Genomics protocol. The SC-RNA-SEQ

548

libraries were generated using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v.3 (10x

549

Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were counted, diluted at

550

1000 cells/µL in PBS+0,04% and 20,000 cells were loaded in the 10x Chromium Controller to

551

generate single-cell gel-beads in emulsion. After reverse transcription, gel-beads in emulsion

552

were disrupted. Barcoded complementary DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR. Following

553

fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing, sample indexes were added during index PCR. The

554

purified libraries were sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 (Illumina) with 28 cycles of read 1, 8

555

cycles of i7 index and 91 cycles of read 2.

556

Sequencing reads were demultiplexed and aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38,

557

release 98, built from Ensembl sources), using the CellRanger Pipeline v3.1. Unfiltered RNA

558

UMI counts were loaded into Seurat v3.1 (Stuart et al., 2019) for quality control, data

559

integration and downstream analyses. Apoptotic cells and empty sequencing capsules were

560

excluded by filtering out cells with fewer than 500 features or a mitochondrial content higher

561

than 20%. Data from each sample were log-normalized and scaled, before batch correction

562

using Seurat’s FindIntegratedAnchors. For computational efficiency, anchors for integration

563

were determined using all control samples as reference and patient samples were projected onto

564

the integrated controls space. On this integrated dataset, we computed the principal component

565

analysis on the 2000 most variable genes. UMAP was carried out using the 20 most significant

566

principal components (PCs), and community detection was performed using the graph-based

567

modularity-optimization Louvain algorithm from Seurat’s FindClusters function with a 0.8

568

resolution. Cell types labels were assigned to resulting clusters based on a manually curated

569

list of marker genes as well as previously defined signatures of the well-known PBMCs

570

subtypes (Monaco et al., 2019). Despite filtering for high quality cells, five clusters out of the

571

twenty-six stood out as poor quality clusters and were removed from further analysis, namely:

572

one erythroid-cell contamination; one low UMI cluster from a single control; two clusters of

573

proliferating cells originating from a patient with EBV co-infection and one megakaryocytes

574

cluster. In total 152,201 cells were kept for further analysis.

575

After extraction and reclustering of high-quality cells, differential expression was performed

576

separately on all PBMCs, Monocytes/DCs, T cells or B cells. Differential expression testing

577

was conducted using the FindMarkers function of Seurat on the RNA assay with default

578

parameters. Genes with log(FC) > 0.25 and adjusted p-values ≤0.05 were selected as

579

significant.

580
581

Bulk RNA-sequencing (Bulk-RNA-SEQ)

582

Bulk-RNA-SEQ analyses were performed on frozen PBMCs extracted from heparin samples.

583

RNA was extracted from PBMCs following the instructions of RNeasyR Mini kit (Qiagen,

584

Courtaboeuf, France). To note, the optional step with the DNase was performed. RNA integrity

585

and concentration were assessed by capillary electrophoresis using Fragment Analyzer

586

(Agilent Technologies). RNAseq libraries were prepared starting from 100 ng of total RNA

587

using the Universal Plus mRNA-Seq kit (Nugen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The

588

oriented cDNA produced from the poly-A+ fraction was sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 from

589

Illumina (Paired-End reads 100 bases + 100 bases). A total of ~50 millions of passing-filters

590

paired-end reads was produced per library.

591

Paired-end RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human Ensembl genome GRCh38.91 using

592

Hisat2 (v2.0.4)(Kim et al., 2019) and counted using featureCounts from the Subread R

593

package. The raw count matrix was analyzed using DESeq2 (version 1.28.1) (Love et al.,

594

2014). No pre-filtering was applied to the data. Differential expression analysis was performed

595

using the "DESeq" function with default parameters. For visualization and clustering, the data

596

was normalized using the `variant stabilizing transformation` method implemented in the “vst”

597

function. Plots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.3.2), and pheatmap (version 1.0.12).

598

During exploratory analyses, it was noted that the clustering was mainly driven by the sex of

599

the patients. To remove this effect, it was included in the regression formula for DESeq (~sex

600

+ groups), and then removed following vst transformation, using "removeBatchEffect" from

601

the "limma" package (version 3.44.3).

602
603

Gene signature analysis

604

To identify genes that could be used as markers of severe myocarditis in the SC-RNA-SEQ

605

dataset, three initial strategies were used, all based on differential expression and selection of

606

the upregulated genes. First, we performed the differential expression between MIS-C_MYO

607

(CoV2+) samples and all other samples. Second, differential analysis was computed between

608

MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) and other samples with postacute hyperinflammatory illness. In the last

609

strategy, we selected genes that were upregulated between the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) and the

610

CTL, but not upregulated in any other group compared to the CTL (Figure 7A). These three

611

strategies allowed us to identify 329 unique genes.

612

To further explore whether these genes could be considered as markers of severe myocarditis,

613

we analyzed their expression profile in our bulk RNA-SEQ dataset. This dataset excluded

614

samples from patients of the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) that were included in the SC-RNA-SEQ

615

cohort. Vst-transformed counts were log2-normalized and converted to z-score using the scale

616

function in R (v 4.0.2). A GeneSCORE was computed for each group as the mean z-score of

617

the samples of a group. Heatmaps representing this GeneSCORE group were performed using

618

pheatmap. Hierarchical clustering of the 329 previously identified genes was performed using

619

the complete method on the distance measured using Pearson’s correlation, as implemented by

620

pheatmap. The hierarchical clustering was divided into 15 main clusters, 4 of which had the

621

expected pattern of expression: Clusters that had a higher expression in MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)

622

than any other group were selected, resulting in 116 genes. A signature score for each sample

623

was performed on these genes, corresponding to the mean expression (z-score) of these N genes

624

in each sample (SignatureSCORE).

625

These genes were subsequently ranked based on the following equation:

626

𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑆𝐶𝑂𝑅𝐸

627

= 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑂𝑅𝐸𝑀𝐼𝑆−𝐶_𝑀𝑌𝑂 (𝐶𝑜𝑉2+) − (𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑂𝑅𝐸𝑀𝐼𝑆−𝐶 (𝐶𝑜𝑉2+)

628

+ 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑆𝐶𝑂𝑅𝐸𝐾𝐷 (𝐶𝑜𝑉2−) )

629

where the SCOREs represent the mean expression (z-score) in each disease groups, and the

630

SignatureScore was computed on the top 25 genes.

631
632

Quantification and statistical analysis

633

Cytokine heatmaps were made with Qlucore OMICS explore (version 3.5(26)) and dot plots

634

with GraphPad Prism (version 8). Differentially secreted cytokines were included in the heat

635

maps based on a 1.5 Fold Change (FC) comparison between groups as indicated. Dot plot

636

differences between each group were identified by Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc

637

multiple comparison Dunn’s test.

638

Statistical tests for cellular composition analysis in both the CyTOF and SC-RNA-SEQ

639

datasets were performed in R v3.6.1. Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc multiple

640

comparison Dunn’s test was applied to assess differences in cell population proportions (*: p

641

≤0.05; **: p ≤0.01; ***: p ≤0.001).

642

Differential expression testing in the SC-RNA-SEQ dataset was conducted using the

643

FindMarkers function in Seurat, with default Wilcoxon testing. P-values were controlled using

644

Bonferroni correction. Genes with an absolute log(fold-change) ≥0.25 and an adjusted p-value

645

≤0.05 were selected as differentially expressed. Pathways analysis was performed using both

646

the Ingenuity pathway analysis v57662101 software (IPA (QIAGEN Inc.) and EnrichR (Chen

647

et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al., 2016). Heatmaps were extracted from the comparison module in

648

IPA. Pathways with an absolute z-score lower than 2 or a Bonferroni-Hochberg corrected p-

649

values higher than 0.05 were filtered out. Reactome 2016 and Molecular Signature DataBase

650

Hallmark 2020 (MSigDB Hallmark 2020) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using

651

EnrichR. The TRRUST transcription factors 2019 (Han et al., 2018) used for the transcription

652

factors enrichment analysis was performed using Enrich R.

Figure S2: Immunoglobulin and cytokine analyses. Related to Figure 2. A. SARS-CoV-2
specific immunoglobulins (IgG, left panels; IgA, right panels) were dosed in the plasma of the
different groups, by two methods: S Flow and Tri ELISA. B - G. Dot plots of cytokines
differentially expressed and grouped based on the description of each sub panel. ρ values are
calculated by Kruskall-Wallis test for multiple comparisons, followed by a post hoc Dunn’s
test. *(ρ < 0.05), **(ρ < 0.01), ***(ρ < 0.001). H. Hierarchical clustering of cytokines
differentially expressed among the patients of the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group without (red
square) or with glucocorticosteroid treatment (black square) before blood sampling.

Figure 3: CyTOF and SC-RNA-SEQ characterization of peripheral blood immune cell
(PBMCs) distribution. A. Upper panel: UMAP of 1,150,000 single cells from PBMCs of 7
CTL, 1 Acute-inf (CoV2-), 4 Acute-inf (CoV2+), 2 MIS-C (CoV2+), 6 MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) and
3 KD (CoV2-) donors, following analyses by CyTOF and displayed as 23 clusters identified
using the individual expression of 29 proteins, as described in Figure S3A. Bottom panel:
boxplots of clusters with significant differences observed between groups. B. Upper panel:
UMAP of 152,201 single cells following extraction from PBMCs (9 CTL, 1 Acute-inf (CoV2), 4 Acute-inf (CoV2+), 2 MIS-C (CoV2+), 6 MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+), and 3 KD (CoV2-)) and
processed by SC-RNA-SEQ. A resolution of 0.8 allows to segregate cells into 26 clusters
identified based on the expression of several markers and gene signatures, as shown in Figure
S4B. Bottom panel: Boxplots of clusters with significant differences.
A & B. (CTL, green; Acute-inf (CoV2-), gray; Acute-inf (CoV2+), blue; MIS-C (CoV2+), orange;
MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+), red; KD (CoV2-), pink). In the boxplots, each dot represents a sample.
Boxes range from the 25th to the 75th percentiles. The upper and lower whiskers extend from
the box to the largest and smallest values respectively. Any samples with a value at most x1.5
the inter-quartile range of the hinge is considered an outlier and plotted individually. ρ values
are calculated by Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons, followed by a post hoc Dunn’s
test. * (ρ < 0.05), **(ρ < 0.01), ***(ρ < 0.001).

Figure S3: Identification of cell clusters and PBMCs distribution. Related to Figure 3. A.
UMAP showing all cell surface proteins measured by CyTOF to identify clusters displayed in
Figure 3A. B. Heatmap of the genes (y axis) used in SC-RNA-SEQ to identify clusters of the
UMAP in Figure 3B. Color scale represents scaled expression of the genes. Red and blue
indicate high and low expression respectively. C & D. Boxplots showing the percentage of cell
populations from CyTOF (C) and SC-RNA-SEQ (D). Among the MIS-C_(CoV2+) group, one
patient was diagnosed with a primary Epstein Barr viral infection, characterized at the cellular
level by an increase of CD4, CD8 effector memory T cells, Tregs and also proliferating cells.
(CTL, green; Acute-inf (CoV2-), gray; Acute-inf (CoV2+), blue; MIS-C (CoV2+), orange; MISC_MYO (CoV2+), red; KD (CoV2-), pink). In the boxplots, each dot represents a sample. Boxes
range from the 25th to the 75th percentiles. The upper and lower whiskers extend from the box
to the largest and smallest values respectively. Any samples with a value at most x1.5 the interquartile range of the hinge is considered an outlier and plotted individually. ρ values are
calculated by Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparison, followed by a post hoc Dunn’s test.
*(ρ < 0.05), **(ρ < 0.01), ***(ρ < 0.001).

Figure 4: Genes and pathways differentially regulated in acute infection and postacute
hyper inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A & B. Bar charts of the number of
up- and downregulated genes in Acute-inf (CoV2+) (A) and All MIS-C (MIS-C (CoV2+) and
MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)) (B), compared to CTL, in PBMCs, monocytes/DCs, T and B cells
clusters obtained following SC-RNA-SEQ experiments as displayed in Figure 3B. PBMCs
represent all clusters; monocytes/DCs cells, clusters 5, 11, 12, 17, 20, 21, 24; T cells, clusters
0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 23; and B cells, clusters 3, 8, 9, 19, and 22. The top
value on the light-colored bars represent the upregulated genes and the bottom dark represent
the downregulated genes. B. Heatmap of the canonical pathways, enriched in the differentially
expressed genes (DEG) from the comparisons performed in A and B in PBMCs,
monocytes/DCs, T and B cells, obtained by using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) analyses.
Left panel, part 1 and right panel part 2. Symbols are used in front of the pathways to represent
pathways belonging to the same functional groups. Pathways with an absolute z-score ≤ 2 or
adjusted p-value > 0.05 in all conditions were filtered out. Z-score > 2 means that a function is
significantly increased (orange) whereas a Z-score < −2 indicates a significantly decreased
function (blue). Grey dots indicate non-significant pathways (ρ > 0.05).

Figure 6: Key pathways and genes deregulated in monocytes/DCs cells of MIS-C_MYO
(CoV2+) compared to MIS-C (CoV2+). A & B. Type-I and type-II interferon signaling
pathways from the IPA software. Changes in gene expression are represented by the log fold
change in monocytes/DCs cells of MIS-C (CoV2+) (A) or MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) (B) compared
to CTL (red color represents an upregulation, green a downregulation and white no changes).
C. Dot plot of the MHC class II-associated genes. D. Dot plot of the 49 genes from the TNFalpha Signaling via NF-B pathway (pathway enrichment analysis by MSigDB Hallmark 2020
(Figure S6E)). E. Dot plot of the 27 genes from the Hypoxia pathway (pathway enrichment
analysis by MSigDB Hallmark 2020 (Figure S6E)). F. Dot plot of the calcium binding genes
of the S100 family in CTL, MIS-C (CoV2+) and MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)
C - F. The expression is represented by the centered scale expression of each gene. The “percent
expressed” represents the percentage of cells that express the gene.

Figure S6: Pathway enrichment analysis in MIS-C (CoV2+) with or without severe
myocarditis. Related to Figure 6. A. Bar charts of the number of up- and downregulated genes
in MIS-C (CoV2+) (left) and MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) (right) compared to CTL in PBMCs,
monocytes/DCs, T and B cells. B. Heatmap of the canonical pathways obtained with IPA from
DEGs of MIS-C (CoV2+) or MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) compared to CTL in PBMCs,
monocytes/DCs, T and B cells. Symbols are used in front of the pathways to represent pathways
belonging to the same functional groups. Pathways with an absolute z-score ≤ 2 or adjusted pvalue > 0.05 in all conditions were filtered out. Z-score > 2 means that a function is significantly
increased (orange) whereas a Z-score < −2 indicates a significantly decreased function (blue).
Grey dots indicate non-significant pathways (ρ > 0.05). C. Bar charts of the number of up- and
downregulated genes in MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) compared to MIS-C (CoV2+) in PBMCs,
monocytes/DCs, T and B cells. D. Bar charts of the top 10 pathways from Reactome_2016,
predicted in EnrichR to be modulated by the downregulated genes in the monocytes/DCs cells
of MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) compared to MIS-C (CoV2+). Pathways are ranked based on combined
score. E. Bar charts of the Transcription factors from TRRUST database (top) and the top 10
pathways from MSigDB_Hallmark_2020 (bottom) predicted in EnrichR to be modulated by
the genes upregulated in monocytes/DC of MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) compared to MIS-C (CoV2+).
Pathways are ranked based on combined score; Transcription factors are ranked based on
adjusted p-values.
A & C. The top values on the light-colored bars represent the upregulated genes and the bottom
dark represent the downregulated genes.

Figure 7: Identification of genes specifically upregulated in monocytes/dendritic cells of
children of the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group. A. Schematic representation of the different
strategies used to extract 329 unique markers of the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group from the
monocytes/DCs clusters obtained from the single-cell dataset. Strategy 1: direct comparison of
the monocytes/DCs cells of the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group to all other samples. Strategy 2:
direct comparison of the monocytes/DCs cells of MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) to other samples with
postacute hyperinflammation (MIS-C (CoV2+) and KD (CoV2-)). Strategy 3: selection of the
genes upregulated only in the monocytes/DCs cells of MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) when compared
to CTL. Below each strategy, the corresponding dot plot obtained from SC-RNA-SEQ, with
the number of upregulated genes. The average expression is represented by the centered scale
expression of each gene. On the left, name of each group with its corresponding color is shown.
B. Heatmap of expression of the 116/329 genes with a higher expression in MIS-C_MYO
(CoV2+) than in other groups in the bulk dataset. Color scale indicates the scaled GeneSCORE
(mean z-score of the gene in all samples of a group), with red and blue representing the highest
and lowest expressions respectively. Hierarchical clustering of the genes was computed with a
Pearson’s correlation as a distance. C. Box plot of the expression of the 116 genes validated in
C, calculated as a SignatureScore. SignatureScore represents for each sample the mean z-score
of the 116 genes selected in B in the bulk-RNA-SEQ dataset. (Explained in Figure S7A). D.
Boxplot showing the SignatureScore computed on the expression of the top 25 genes, as ranked
in Figure S7B, in the Bulk-RNA-SEQ dataset.
C & D. Each dot represents a sample. Boxes range from the 25th to the 75th percentiles. The
upper and lower whiskers extend from the box to the largest and smallest values respectively.
Any samples with a value at most x1.5 the inter-quartile range of the hinge is considered an
outlier and plotted individually.

Figure S7: SignatureScore and top genes correlated with the occurrence of myocarditis in
MIS-C (CoV2+). Related to Figure 7. A. MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)-specific genes were scored
(GeneSCORE) by adding their expression values (as z-scores) in each sample, divided by the
total number of samples. Similarly, a SignatureSCORE was derived for each sample as the
mean z-score of these samples. From these two scores, a RankingScore was calculated by
subtracting the GeneScore of the MIS-C (CoV2+) and the CTL groups to the GeneSCORE of
the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group. B. Top: Barplot of the RankingScore of each gene. Red, green
and orange barplots: GeneScore of the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+)-specific genes in the MISC_MYO (CoV2+), CTL and MIS-C (CoV2+) groups respectively. Genes are ranked based on
their RankingScore as explained in S7A C. Curated analyses based on literature regarding the
known links between the top 25 genes, and inflammatory response, myocarditis, oxidative
stress, TNF-, NF-B, MIS-C or Kawasaki disease, SARS-CoV-2 and/or COVID-19. On the
Y axis, genes are positioned from top to bottom following their rank (Top = ranked 1). A blue
dot means strong links between the gene and the pathway (on the X axis) were found in peerreviewed scientific publications. D. Heatmap of the expression of the genes of the S100A
family, extracted from Bulk-RNA-SEQ, from PBMCs. Color scale indicate the scaled
GeneSCORE (mean z-score of the gene in all samples of a group), with red and blue
representing the highest and lowest expressions respectively. Hierarchical clustering of the
genes was computed with a Pearson’s correlation as a distance.

Figure S8. A & B. Graphical representation based on cytokines, cellular and transcriptomic
analyses (part above black dotted line), combined with known literature (part under the black
dotted line), illustrating a putative model explaining the occurrence of myocarditis among
children in the MIS-C (CoV2+) group. A. model based on the MIS-C (CoV2+) group and B.
model based on the MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) group. Black writing represents genes and functions
both modulated in the MIS-C (CoV2+) and MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) groups compared to CTL,
whereas green and red are highlighting genes and pathways differentially modulated in the MISC (CoV2+) and MIS-C_MYO (CoV2+) groups, respectively.
