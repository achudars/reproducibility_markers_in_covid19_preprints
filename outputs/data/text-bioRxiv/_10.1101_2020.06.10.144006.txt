Forecasting virus diffusion
with simple Bayesian forecast combination

Abstract
There are various diffusion models for S shaped processes like virus diffusion and these models
are typically not nested. In this note it is proposed to combine the forecasts using a simple
Bayesian forecast combination algorithm. An illustration to daily data on cumulative Covid-19
cases in the Netherlands shows the ease of use of the algorithm and the accuracy of the thus
combined forecasts.

1. Introduction
Virus diffusion often obeys an S shaped pattern. Consider for example the daily cumulative new
cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands in Figure 1, for the sample February 27, 2020 with the first
case, and May 19, 2020 with 44249 cases. The S shape is obvious. Figure 2 presents the daily
new cases, and, as expected, a humped shape is noticeable, although at the same time variation
across the days can be large.
Each day it can be of interest to predict the total cumulative number of cases for the next day.
There are various models for S shaped data, and there is no evidence that one of these models is
always preferable over the others. Hence, it seems reasonable to consider various models at the
same time. For forecasting, it may then also be useful to combine the forecast, see Bates and
Granger (1969), Clemen (1989) and Timmermann (2006) for evidence that combined forecasts
often yield an improvement over individual forecasts. A typical combination refers to assign
equal weights to the forecasts. In this paper it is however proposed to assign weights based on insample performance of each of the models, as reflected by their posterior probabilities, see
Leamer (1978) for the first discussion of Bayesian model averaging. In practice, Bayesian
methods may sometimes be difficult to handle, but here I rely on an important result in Raftery
(1995, page 145), which is that the posterior probability can be expressed as a simple function of
the values of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz 1978). Such a BIC value is
easily with the estimated maximum likelihood and many statistical packages report BIC values.
The outline of this note is as follows. Section 2 present three models that are frequently used for
modeling and forecasting S shaped diffusion processes. Section 3 presents the simple algorithm
to compute combined forecasts. Section 4 analyzes the recursive one-day-ahead forecasts for the
three models, and two combined forecasts. It is found that the combination based on posterior
probabilities yields accurate forecasts. Section 5 concludes.

2. The models
This section presents three functional forms that can be used to model and predict S shaped
diffusion processes. These forms are chosen because these are extensively used in practice, as
they are not nested, and because they all have just three unknown parameters. Denote the
cumulative new cases as 𝑦𝑡, for 𝑡 = 1,2,3,…, 𝑇, and denote 𝑚 as the final cumulative number of
cases, and 𝛼 > 0 and 𝛽 > 0 as two unknown parameters.
The first is the logistic curve, which is represented by

𝑦𝑡 =

𝑚
1 + exp ( ‒ 𝛼(𝑡 ‒ 𝛽))
1

The inflection point, or peak moment of new cases, that is, 𝑦𝑡𝑖 = 2𝑚 occurs at 𝑡 = 𝛽. Adding an

error term, the parameters (and associated standard errors) can be estimated using Nonlinear
Least Squares (NLS). The second is the Gompertz curve, represented by
𝑦𝑡 = 𝑚 𝑒𝑥𝑝( ‒ 𝛼(exp ( ‒ 𝛽𝑡))),
1

for which 𝑦𝑡𝑖 = 𝑒𝑚, which occurs at

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝛼
𝛽

. As the inflection point has a cumulative number of

1

cases which is less than 2𝑚, the Gompertz curve is asymmetric. Again, NLS can be used to

estimate the parameters. The third and final function is the Bass (1969) growth curve, which is
represented by

𝑦𝑡 = 𝑚

1 ‒ exp ( ‒ (𝛼 + 𝛽)𝑡)
𝛽
1 + exp ( ‒ (𝛼 + 𝛽)𝑡)
𝛼

‒ 2𝛽 .

Again, this is an asymmetric curve as the latter expression is smaller than 2𝑚. There are various

estimation methods for the parameters, but to treat all three models equally, I will consider NLS
also for the Bass model.

3. Simple Bayesian forecast combination
The three models will be considered for the sample 𝑡 = 1,2,3,…, 𝑇, and then a one-step-ahead
forecast will be created for 𝑇 + 1. Next, the sample moves to 𝑡 = 1,2,3,…, 𝑇 + 1, and a forecast
is created for 𝑇 + 2. This will be repeated for 𝑁 forecasts.
Each of the three models gives 𝑁 one-step-ahead forecasts, and these are denoted as 𝑦𝑇 +𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐
𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1
𝐺𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑧
𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑠
, as 𝑦𝑇 +
𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1 and as 𝑦𝑇 + 𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1, respectively, for 𝑖 = 1,2,3,...,𝑁. Additionally, it might be

useful to incorporate combined forecasts. A simple average forecast, which, as is found in the
literature, is hard to beat in many practical situations, is

𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑡 =

1
𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑠
(𝑦 𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 + 𝑦𝑇 +𝐺𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑧
𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1 + 𝑦𝑇 + 𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1)
3 𝑇 + 𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1

An alternative combination might take into account the quality of the model in the in-sample
period. One way to do so is to consider the in-sample posterior probabilities of each of the
models given the data. When the prior probability of each of the models is equal, which seems
reasonable here, Raftery (1995) shows that the posterior probability (here for the Logistic curve
for illustration) can be computed as

(

where BIC is the familiar Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978). With these three
posterior probabilities, one can construct a Bayesian average forecast simply as
𝐵𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑛 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑡
𝐺𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑧
= 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐)𝑦𝑇 +𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐
𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1 + 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐺𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑧)𝑦𝑇 + 𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1 + 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑠) 𝑦
𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑠
𝑇 + 𝑖|𝑇 + 𝑖 ‒ 1

As the forecasts are created recursively, one should also compute for each forecast the BIC again
for the recursive samples.

4. Covid-19 cases in the Netherlands
To illustrate, consider the data as in Figure 1. The data run from February 27, 2020 (with the first
case) to and including May 19, 2020. At first sight, it seems that the inflection point is
somewhere in the beginning of April. To have a large enough sample to estimate the parameters,
and also to have a large enough sample to evaluate the forecasts, I set 𝑇 at March 31, 2020,
which is before the visually suggested inflection point, and hence there are 𝑁 = 49 forecasts to
evaluate.
Figure 3 presents the 𝑁 = 49 BIC values, where of course lower values indicate a better fit.
Figure 4 gives the three posterior probabilities over time, and it is clear that the posterior
probability of the Gompertz model is about twice as large as those for the other two models.
Table 1 presents the estimation results for the three models for the full sample with 𝑇 + 𝑁
observations. Looking back from May 19, 2020 it seems that the inflection point occurred
somewhere in the first ten days of April 2020.
Table 2 presents the results on forecast accuracy. Clearly, the Logistic and Bass models perform
poorly, whereas the Gompertz model gives rather accurate forecasts. The Bayesian average
forecast is more accurate than the simple average forecast, and hence it seems useful to
incorporate the quality of the in-sample fit in the combined forecast. In terms of absolute forecast
errors, the Bayesian combined forecasts are more accurate than the logistic forecasts for 48 of the

49 days, more accurate than the Bass forecasts also in 48 of the 49 days, more accurate than the
sample equal weight averages in 41 of the 49 days, but only for 24 of the 49 days more accurate
than the Gompertz model forecasts are obtained. This closeness is also reflected by the error
measures in Table 2, which indicate that the Gompertz model itself, at least for these data,
provides already reasonably accurate forecasts.

5. Conclusion
This note has implemented a simple algorithm to combine non-nested model forecasts in a
Bayesian way. The algorithm only needs the BIC values, and with these, one can compute the
posterior probabilities of each of the models. When evaluating forecasts for Covid-19 cases it
was found that the Bayesian approach, which takes the in-sample fit of each of the models into
account, yielded more accurate forecasts than equal weighted average forecasts.
