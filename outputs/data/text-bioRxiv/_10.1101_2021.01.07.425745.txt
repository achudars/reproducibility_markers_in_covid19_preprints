Abstract

33

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has triggered a

34

global pandemic with devastating consequences for health-care and social-economic

35

systems. Thus, the understanding of fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 is of extreme

36

importance.

37

In this work, we have focused our attention on the viral ribonuclease (RNase) nsp14, since

38

this protein was considered one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2,

39

and affects viral replication. This RNase is a multifunctional protein that harbors two

40

distinct activities, an N-terminal 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-

41

methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both with critical roles in coronaviruses life cycle.

42

Namely, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN knockout mutants are non-viable, indicating nsp14

43

as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs.

44

Nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein, which

45

has a pleiotropic function during viral replication. In this study, we have performed the

46

first biochemical characterization of the complex nsp14-nsp10 from SARS-CoV-2. Here

47

we confirm the 3’-5’ exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 in this new

48

Coronavirus, and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity in

49

vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is

50

functionally independent of the ExoN activity. The nsp14 MTase activity also seems to

51

be independent of the presence of nsp10 cofactor, contrarily to nsp14 ExoN.

52

Until now, there is no available structure for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex. As

53

such, we have modelled the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex based on the 3D

54

structure of the complex from SARS-CoV (PDB ID 5C8S). We also have managed to

55

map key nsp10 residues involved in its interaction with nsp14, all of which are also shown

56

to be essential for stimulation of the nsp14 ExoN activity. This reinforces the idea that a

57

stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is strictly required for the nsp14-mediated

58

ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2, as observed for SARS-CoV.

59

We have studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14

60

ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function

61

contrasting to the functionality of these conserved catalytic residues in SARS-CoV, and

62

in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavírus (MERS). The differences here

63

revealed can have important implications regarding the specific pathogenesis of SARS-

64

CoV-2.

The nsp10-nsp14 interface is a recognized attractive target for antivirals against SARS-

66

CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. This work has unravelled a basis for discovering

inhibitors targeting the specific amino acids here reported, in order to disrupt the assembly

of this complex and interfere with coronaviruses replication.

Introduction

97

Over the last years, we have observed the emergence of different coronaviruses (CoVs)

98

that have caused serious human epidemic diseases like the Severe Acute Respiratory

99

Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and,

100

currently, the pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

101

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and belongs, together with SARS-CoV

102

and MERS-CoV, to the genera Betacoronavirus. All these three viruses emerged as novel

103

coronaviruses, considered to have initially been transmitted to humans from animals

104

(zoonotic viruses), and all cause respiratory illnesses [1].

105

CoVs are enveloped, single-stranded positive‐sense RNA viruses from the order

106

Nidovirales that have the largest genome among RNA viruses (~30 kb in the case of

107

SARS-CoV-2) [2]. SARS-CoV-2 contains a large replicase gene that occupies two-thirds

108

of the genome encompassing nonstructural proteins (nsps), followed by structural and

109

accessory genes. Among the nsp proteins, there is the nsp14 ribonuclease.

110

Ribonucleases (RNases) are key factors in the control of all biological processes. These

111

enzymes ensure maturation, degradation and quality control of all types of RNAs in all

112

domains of life [3; 4; 5; 6; 7]. Nsp14 protein has exoribonucleolytic activity conferred by

113

its N-terminal ExoN domain [8]. The ExoN domain resembles the superfamily of DEDDh

114

exonucleases, which also includes the proofreading domains of many DNA polymerases

115

as well as other eukaryotic and prokaryotic exonucleases [9]. These enzymes catalyze the

116

excision of nucleoside monophosphates from nucleic acids in the 3’-to-5’ direction, using

117

a mechanism that depends on two divalent metal ions and a reactive water molecule [10;

118

11; 12]. This exonucleolytic activity is critical for the proofreading activity during

119

Coronavirus replication, a property missing in other RNA viruses, which enhances its

120

replication fidelity and has played an important role in nidoviral evolution and genome

121

expansion [13].

122

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 79.5% of genome homology and much of what is

123

presently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2 was inferred from previous studies

124

on SARS-CoV [14]. However, some striking differences suggest important differences

125

between the two CoVs in terms of infectiousness and the effects they have on human

126

hosts.

127

Despite the high amino acid sequence identity (95%) between the nsp14 of both viruses,

128

SARS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants are viable, even with an increased mutation

129

frequency, while the equivalent ExoN knockout mutants of SARS-CoV-2 are non-viable

130

[15]. This striking difference suggests an additional and critical ExoN function in SARS-

131

CoV-2 replication. Nsp14 ExoN seems to have a very important role in SARS-CoV-2

132

RNA synthesis [15], showing up as a prominent target for the development of antiviral

133

drugs.

134

Whereas basal nsp14 ExoN activity does not require the presence of co-factors, its activity

135

is only fully activated in the presence of the nsp10 protein [16]. The crystal structure of

136

SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its nsp10 co-factor has shed light on how the

137

interaction between the proteins occurs [17].

138

The N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is a defining structural feature of eukaryotic

139

mRNAs, including those of eukaryotic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. SARS-

140

CoV nsp14 was discovered to be a bifunctional protein, since beyond its

141

exoribonucleolytic activity it also displays a guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase)

142

activity in its C-terminal domain [18]. This means that the enzyme is capable of

143

methylating cap analogues or GTP substrates, in the presence of S-adenosyl methionine

144

(SAM) as methyl donor [18; 19]. The nsp14 N7-MTtase activity is essential for formation

145

of a functional 5’ RNA cap structure, critical for stability and translation of CoV mRNAs

146

in the host cells. In fact, mRNA cap methylation requires the concerted action of three

147

viral proteins: nsp14, nsp10 and nsp16. Additionally to nsp14, nsp10 is also responsible

148

for stimulating the activity of nsp16 2’-O-MTase, which makes this protein a central

149

player in RNA cap methylation [20]. The obligate sequence of methylation events is

150

initiated by nsp14, which first methylates capped RNA transcripts to generate cap-0

151

7Me

152

nsp16 in complex with its activator nsp10 to give rise to cap-1

153

While nsp14 recognizes non-methylated RNA cap exclusively, nsp10/nsp16 recognizes

154

N7-methylated RNA cap [20].

155

Coronaviruses have the inherent capacity to mutate, recombine and infect different hosts.

156

This raises an urgent need for the development of effective antiviral drugs to fight against

157

the present and future pandemic diseases that may arise. Through its dual function, nsp14

158

protein plays a prominent role in CoV life cycle, and, thus, it is a very attractive target for

159

drug design. Its N7-MTase activity is involved in RNA cap modification to assist in

160

translation and evading host defences, while the 3′-5′ ExoN activity (stimulated by nsp10)

161

has a direct role in CoV RNA synthesis beyond assuring the long-term genome fidelity.

162

In this work we provide a biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14/nsp10,

163

addressing several aspects of this complex for the first time. By contributing to the deep

GpppA-RNAs. The latter are then selectively 2’O-methylated by the 2’O-MTase
7Me

GpppA2’OMe-RNAs.

164

understanding of nsp14/nsp10 mechanisms of action, this work will also help to clarify

165

its role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Importantly, it will serve as a basis for the design

166

of effective drugs to treat Covid-19 and other CoVs infections.

Materials and methods

170
171

Plasmid construction

172

Full-length nsp10 and nsp14 genes from SARS-CoV2 (Uniprot ID P0DTD1) were

173

optimized for E. coli expression and synthesized by GenScript (USA). The synthesized

174

genes were subsequently cloned into the NdeI–BamHI sites of commercial pET15b to

175

generate pET15b_Nsp10 and pET15b_Nsp14, which express N-terminal His-tagged

176

versions of nsp10 and nsp14.

177

The point mutations F19A, G69A, S72A, H80A and Y96A were introduced into

178

pET15b_Nsp10 by overlapping PCR using the primers listed in table S1. The point

179

mutations D90A, E92A, D243A, D273A and D331A were introduced into

180

pET15b_Nsp14 also by overlapping PCR (table S2). All the constructions were verified

181

by sequencing at StabVida (Portugal).

182
183

Protein expression and purification

184

Plasmids expressing nsp10 WT and point mutations were transformed into Bl21 (DE3)

185

cells, while plasmids expressing nsp14 WT and point mutations were transformed into

186

Rosetta cells for the expression of the recombinant proteins. Cells were grown in LB

187

medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin (Nsp10 variants) or TB medium

188

supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol (nsp14 variants)

189

at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.5. At this point, protein expression was induced by addition of

190

0.5 mM IPTG and bacteria were grown for further 16 h. Cells were pelleted by

191

centrifugation and stored at −80°C. To co-purify nsp10 with nsp14, cultures

192

overexpressing each protein separately were pelleted together. The culture pellets were

193

resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer A (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM

194

imidazol). Cell suspensions were lysed using the FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedical) at 6.5 m/s

195

for 60 seconds in the presence of 0.5 mM PMSF. The crude extract was treated with

196

Benzonase (Sigma) to degrade the nucleic acids and clarified by a 30 min centrifugation

197

at 10 000 xg. Purification was performed in an ÄKTA FPLC™ system (GE Healthcare).

198

The cleared lysate was subjected to a histidine affinity chromatography in a HisTrap HP

199

column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A. Proteins were eluted by a continuous

200

imidazole gradient up to 500 mM in Buffer A. The fractions containing the purified

201

protein were pooled together, and concentrated by centrifugation at 4°C with Amicon

202

Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices of 10 000 MWCO (Millipore) and buffer exchanged to

203

Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl). Afterwards, the proteins were subjected

204

to a size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase column (GE

205

Healthcare) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using buffer B. The samples collected were

206

analysed in a 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by BlueSafe staining (NZYTech, Portugal).

207

Samples with the highest purity were pooled together and concentrated by centrifugation

208

at 4°C with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices of 10 000 MWCO (Millipore). All

209

protein versions were purified at least twice to ensure reproducibility of the results.

210

Proteins were quantified using the Bradford Method and 50% (v/v) glycerol was added

211

to the final fractions prior storage at −20°C.

212
213

RNase Activity Assays

214

A synthetic 22-mer oligoribonucleotide (H4 5’-UGACGGCCCGGAAAACCGGGCC-

215

3’) (StabVida, Portugal) was used as a substrate in the activity assays. The RNA was

216

labelled at its 5′ end with [32P]-γ-ATP and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (Ambion) in a

217

standard reaction. MicroSpin G-50 columns (GE Healthcare, Cytiva) were used to

218

remove excess [32P]-γ-ATP. In order to fold its 3′-end into a duplex structure, the RNA

219

was resuspended in 10 mM of Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and incubated 10 min at 80°C followed

220

by 45 min at 37°C.

221

The activity assays were performed in a final volume of 12 µl containing the activity

222

buffer - 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT and 5 mM of either MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2,

223

NiCl2, ZnCl2, CoCl2 or CuCl2 - and the proteins nsp14 and nsp10 (protein concentrations

224

are indicated in the figure legends). The reactions were started by the addition of 50 nM

225

of the RNA substrate, and further incubated at 37°C. Aliquots of 4 µl were withdrawn at

226

the time-points indicated in the respective figures, and the reactions were stopped by the

227

addition of formamide containing dye supplemented with 10 mM EDTA. A control

228

reaction containing only the RNA substrate and the activity buffer (without the enzyme)

229

was incubated in the same conditions during the full time of the assay. Reaction products

230

were resolved in a 20% denaturant polyacrylamide gel (7M urea). Signals were visualized

by PhosphorImaging (TLA-5100 Series, Fuji). All the experiments were performed at

232

least in triplicate.

233
234

Surface Plasmon Resonance

235

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed by using a CM5 sensor chip (Cytiva)

236

and a Biacore 2000 system (Cytiva). Purified nsp14 was immobilized in flow cell 2 of the

237

CM5 sensor chip by the amine coupling procedure. The surface was activated with a 1:1

238

mixture

239

hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), injected during 5 min at a flow rate of 10 µl/min. Then, 20

240

µg/ml of nsp14 were injected during 10 min at the same flow rate. After the injection of

241

the ligand, ethanolamine was injected over the surface to deactivate it. The

242

immobilization of the protein originated a response of 400 RU. On flow cell 1 (used as a

243

control), BSA protein was immobilized using the same method. Biosensor assays were

244

run at 15 ºC in a buffer with 25 mM HEPES-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mM DTT and 2,5 mM of

245

MgCl2. Serial dilutions of purified Nsp10 WT and mutant proteins were injected over

246

flow cells 2–1 for 3 min at concentrations of 50, 100, 175, 250 and 500 nM using a flow

247

rate of 20 ml/min. The dissociation was allowed to occur during 5 min in the running

248

buffer. All experiments included triple injections of each protein concentration to

249

determine the reproducibility of the signal. Bound proteins were removed after each cycle

250

with a 30 s wash with 2 M NaCl. After each cycle, the signal was stabilized during 1 min

251

before the next protein injection. Data from flow cell 1 was used to correct refractive

Preparation of the Capped RNA Substrate

255

A 30-mer RNA substrate was first synthesized using a synthetic DNA template and a

256

promoter oligonucleotide obtained by commercial source (StabVida) for in vitro

257

transcription, using the method described by [21]. Briefly, the DNA synthetic template

258

(0.5 μM) and the T7 promoter oligonucleotide (0.6 μM) were annealed in 10 mM of Tris-

259

HCl pH 8.0 by heating for 5 min at 70ºC, following by incubation for 30 min, at 37ºC. In

260

vitro transcription was carried out using ‘NZY T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit’

261

(NZYtech) following manufacturer instructions. To remove the DNA template, 1U of

262

DNase (Invitrogen) was then added to the reaction and incubated 15 min at 37°C. Non-

263

incorporated ribonucleotides were removed with Microspin G-50 Columns (Cytiva).

264

For the insertion of a 32P-labeled cap structure (G*ppp-RNA) in the 5’end of 30 mer RNA

265

substrate we used the vaccinia virus capping enzyme following the manufacturer’s

266

protocol (New England Biolabs), except that the methyl donor SAM was absent and 0.05

267

units of inorganic pyrophosphatase (New England Biolabs) were added to improve the

268

efficiency of the reaction. A parallel reaction was prepared following the manufacturer’s

269

protocol (New England Biolabs) and using 2 mM SAM to obtain m7G*ppp-RNA. Non-

270

incorporated radioisotope was removed using Microspin G-50 Columns (Cytiva), and the

271

labelled substrate was then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol

272

precipitation. A small fraction of m7G*ppp-RNA and of G*ppp-RNA were digested with

273

5 μg nuclease P1 (Sigma) in 50 mM NaOAc pH5.2 buffer to originate the m 7G*ppp and

274

G*pppG markers in the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) run.

275
276

Mtase Activity Assays

277

To test MTase activity of nsp14 WT or mutant versions, a reaction mix containing the

278

purified recombinant protein (~1 µg), approximately 2 µg of 32P-labeled 30-mer G*ppp-

279

RNA substrate, 0.1 mM of SAM, an RNase inhibitor and 2 mM DTT in a total volume of

280

20 ul, was prepared in the reaction buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM

281

MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The same reaction without

282

nsp14 treatment was performed as control. To liberate the cap structures, both RNAs

283

(with and without nsp14 treatment) were digested with 1.25 units of nuclease P1 (Sigma)

284

in 50 mM NaOAc pH5.2 buffer for 30 min at 37ºC, followed by the inactivation of the

285

enzyme (75ºC for 10 min).

286

A TLC analysis was performed to separate G*pppG from capped m7G*pppG. For this,

287

polyethyleneimine cellulose-F plates (Merck) were previously pre-run with water, air-

288

dried and then spotted with 2-3 ul of the P1 digestion reaction (1 µl spotted at each time,

289

and let dry) and developed in 0.4 M ammonium sulphate. The m7G*pppG and G*pppG

290

markers (see above) were run in parallel. The chromatograms were then scanned with a

Protein modelling

Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex was done with the program

296

Modeller version 9.23 [22]. The crystal structure of the corresponding complex on SARS-

297

Cov (PDB ID 5C8S) was used as the template for the homology modelling [17]. The

298

catalytic and metal-binding amino acids were kept fixed during the model refinement

299

stages. Twelve independent models were generated and ranked using the normalized

300

DOPE score [23]. Subsequent analyses were carried on the model with the lowest score.

301

The final model was further used as the template for modeling the structures of the mutant

302

proteins. Only the substituted residue and its neighboring residues (within 6 Å) were

303

refined during the modeling process.

Results

307
308

ExoN activity of nsp14 is stimulated in the presence of nsp10

309

We have purified both SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 and nsp14 proteins individually through

310

immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size-exclusion

311

chromatography based on previous works [16; 24] (Materials and Methods section). As

312

showed in Figure S1, nsp10 and nsp14 migrate at 17 KDa and 62 KDa, respectively,

313

consistent with their expected molecular weights. In the case of nsp10, which is known

314

to have 12 identical subunits assembled into a spherical dodecameric architecture [25],

315

the visible higher bands (highlighted with an asterisk *) correspond to reminiscent

316

oligomers of the protein. This was further confirmed by Western blot using antibodies

317

specific for the His-tag tail of the protein (data not shown).

318

First, we intended to test the ribonuclease activity of the purified SARS-CoV-2 nsp14.

319

We have used the synthetic RNA substrate H4 previously reported in Bouvet et al. [16].

320

This substrate is a 22-nucleotide (nt) long RNA with a 5’ single-stranded (ss) tail and a

321

3’-end engaged in a stable duplex structure (Figure S2). The nsp14 ExoN activity was

322

then determined by analyzing the hydrolysis of the H4 RNA 5’-end radiolabeled. As we

323

can see in the left panel of Figure 1A, nsp14 alone exhibits exoribonucleolytic activity;

324

however, in the conditions tested (40 nM of nsp14), the activity was not pronounced.

325

(Figure 1A). Nsp10 was previously reported as a critical co-factor for activation of nsp14

326

ExoN activity in SARS-CoV [16; 17]. As such, we have analyzed the influence of nsp10

327

in the activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14, using different molar ratios between nsp14 and

328

nsp10 (Figure 1A). SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN activity was found to be stimulated by

329

nsp10 in a dose-dependent manner. At equimolar ratio (1:1), the ExoN activity is weakly

330

stimulated compared with the ExoN activity exhibited by nsp14 alone. By increasing the

331

concentration of nsp10, the maximal ExoN activity was achieved with a ratio nsp14-

332

nsp10 of 1:4, in agreement with the results reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [15;

333

16]. In this condition, we observe a faster RNA degradation and almost complete

334

disappearance of the full-length RNA after 30 minutes of incubation. The degradation

335

products formed range between 17- to 20-nts in length, which corresponds to cleavage

336

from the 3’-end of the RNA duplex region of the 22-nt long H4 RNA. By increasing the

337

concentration of nsp14 (and also of nsp10 proportionally), the hydrolysis of the substrate

338

becomes much more efficient, yielding smaller breakdown products corresponding to

339

degradation of the ss- and double-stranded (ds)-regions (Figure S3). The ladder-like

340

pattern of the degradation products is typical of exoribonucleolytic cleavage of the RNA

341

in the 3’-5’ direction (considering that the RNA is labeled at the 5’ end), further

342

supporting CoVs nsp14 3’-5’ directionality [15; 16; 26]. As a control, we have tested

343

nsp10 alone (at 160 nM, which was the higher concentration used in nsp10:nsp14 ratio)

344

for ribonucleolytic activity under the same conditions used for nsp14. As expected, nsp10

345

was not able to degrade the RNA substrate (Figure 1A).

346

The ability of nsp10 to interact with nsp14 was analyzed through Surface Plasmon

347

Resonance (SPR) (Figure 1B). For this, purified nsp14 was immobilized in a sensor chip

348

and nsp10 was injected at different concentrations as described in materials and methods.

349

The results confirm that both proteins interact with each other as showed by an increased

350

response when nsp10 is injected. This increase is dependent on nsp10 concentrations and

351

it is possible to see the dissociation of nsp10 over time when injection stops. Since nsp14

352

or nsp10 were shown to be very unstable proteins, it was not possible to obtain a good fit

353

of the data in order to determine the binding kinetics and dissociation constants.

354

We have also co-purified nsp10 and nsp14 proteins. During the size exclusion

355

chromatography step, several fractions corresponding to different peaks have been

356

collected (Figure 1C). Analysis of those fractions by SDS-PAGE gel shows the presence

357

of both nsp14 and nsp10 proteins in all fractions and in different ratios (Figure 1C),

358

confirming their interaction. We then tested the ExoN activity of some of the eluted

359

fractions (Figure 1C, bottom gel). Fraction 16 that appears to have an equimolar

360

proportion of nsp14-nsp10, exhibited increased activity and degraded the full-length

361

RNA in 15 minutes, with major breakdown products of 18-, 17- and 16-nts. 25 nM of this

362

fraction was sufficient to degrade all the full length substrate, whereas for the mixture of

363

nsp14 and nsp10 separately purified, 40 nM and 160 nM have been used respectively (1:4

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.425745; this version posted January 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

364

ratio). Surprisingly, fraction 20, which appears to have more nsp14 compared to nsp10,

365

was the most active sample. This fraction showed the ability of totally consuming the

366

RNA, starting with the ds-region and then proceeding to the ss-region of the substrate,

367

generating products of smaller size. With 50 nM of this fraction, the degradation proceeds

368

until it reaches a unique and final product of 8-nts (Figure S4). This result is in line with

369

the reported ability of SARS-CoV nsp14 to hydrolyze ssRNA to end products of 8-12 nts

370

[16; 26]. Finally, fractions 10 (excess of nsp14) and 24 (excess of nsp10) present a similar

371

ability to cleave the H4 RNA. The activity of these fractions was comparable to that

372

observed when testing nsp14 and nsp10 mixed together in the 1:4 ratio (Figure 1C). We

373

can conclude that co-purifying nsp14 and nsp10 proteins substantially increases nsp14

374

ExoN activity, and, in this case, the ratio between them seems not to be determinant to

375

achieve high levels of ExoN activity. However, taking into account that our intention was

376

the study of several mutant versions of these proteins from SARS-CoV-2, and considering

377

the results obtained, the remaining experiments were performed with nsp14 and nsp10

378

purified separately. The fact that both nsp14 and nsp10 need a ratio in which nsp10 is in

379

excess (Figure 1A), may be an indication of the instability of the complex, otherwise it

380

might have maximum activity with a 1:1 ratio. Indeed, during the experimental part of

381

this work, we noticed that the ExoN activity decreased with time and the activity is

382

completely lost after two weeks. The same behavior was previously observed [27]. As

383

such, all the experiments were performed with proteins freshly purified.

384
385

SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN activity is metal-dependent

386

The activity of the nsp14 ExoN domain is also known to be dependent on divalent cations

387

[16; 17; 26; 28]. In order to determine which divalent metals supports maximal activity

388

of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex, we tested ExoN activity in the presence of

389

different divalent ions: Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+ or Zn2+ (Figure 2). As already

390

reported for several other RNases, binding of these different metal ions might affect the

391

activity of SARS-CoV-2 ExoN by inducing structural changes in the active site [28; 29;

392

30]. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 ExoN nsp14 is active in the presence of both

393

Mg2+ and Mn2+, with a more pronounced activity in the presence of Mg2+. When Mn2+ is

394

added to the reaction, the activity is more distributive and smaller breakdown products

395

with ladder-like pattern are visible (Figure 2). Ca2+ did not support the catalysis, in

396

agreement with data obtained for SARS-CoV nsp14 and other proteins from the DEDD

397

family [11; 31]. The same was observed for Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions (Figure 2). Interestingly,

398

in the presence of Co2+ and Zn2+ we observed a residual, but not relevant ExoN activity

399

(Figure 2). Chen et al. [28] also reported nsp14 residual activity in the presence of Zn2+.

400

Finally, the addition of the chelating agent EDTA to the reaction completely blocks nsp14

401

ExoN activity (Figure 2), confirming the importance of divalent ions, namely Mg2+ and

402

Mn2+, for this activity, similar to that described for the SARS-CoV counterpart [16; 27;

403

28].

404
405

SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 residues involved in nsp14-10 complex formation showed that

406

the stability of this complex is determinant for ExoN activity

407

Until now, there is no available structure for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex. As

408

such, we have modelled the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex based on the 3D

409

structure of the complex from SARS-CoV (PDB ID 5C8S) (Figure 3) [17]. This was

410

possible due to the sequence and structural similarities between nsp10 and nsp14 proteins

411

between the two viruses (Figure 4A and 5A). The crystal structure of the isolated nsp10

412

from SARS-CoV-2 was recently solved, and all-atoms RMSD between this structure and

413

the one from the SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp14 complex is 1.36 Å [32]. However, the isolated

414

nsp10 structure from SARS-CoV-2 was not used in the modelling, since we wanted to

415

keep the nsp14-nsp10 native contacts as much as possible. The all-atoms RMSD between

416

the generated model (Figure 3) and the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp14

417

complex was 0.76 Å. Comparing with the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 structure, our model

418

showed an all-atoms RMSD of 1.33 Å, which is in agreement with the deviations found

419

between the crystal structures. The model is represented in Figure 3, and as we can see

420

the interaction between nsp14 and nsp10 is figuratively similar to a “hand (nsp14) over

421

fist (nsp10)”.

422

Conserved amino acids located on the surface of nsp10 were reported to be involved in

423

nsp14-nsp10 interaction in other CoVs [16; 24; 33; 34]. As such, and in order to study

424

their role in ExoN activity, we mutated some of these amino acids (highlighted in red

425

boxes in Figure 4A) into alanines creating the point mutants F19A, G69A, S72A, H80A

426

and Y96A. As shown in the sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 protein with

427

the nsp10 from the two other highly pathogenic and deadly human coronaviruses SARS-

428

CoV and MERS (Figure 4A), these amino acids are conserved among the three CoVs

429

with the exception of Y96. This residue is unique to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

430

whereas a phenylalanine (F96) is found in most other CoVs, including MERS that belongs

431

to a different lineage of the betacoronavirus genus [34]. Indeed, the sequence alignment

432

(Figure 4A) reveals that the three proteins present a high degree of sequence conservation,

433

with SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 being more closely related to SARS-CoV (97.1% of sequence

434

identity and 99.3% of sequence similarity).

435

Substitution of these residues by an alanine is not expected to drastically alter the

436

structures of these nsp10 protein variants comparing to that of the nsp10 wild-type (WT),

437

as confirmed by NMR for SARS-CoV nsp10 mutants [33; 34; 35]. His-tagged nsp10

438

mutant derivatives were expressed in E. coli and purified (Figure S1). The functional

439

consequences of these nsp10 mutations were evaluated in terms of their interaction with

440

nsp14 through SPR. As expected the instability of these proteins, only enabled us to

441

access the interaction of 75 nM of each version with immobilized nsp14, without

442

determining the kinetics of the reaction. As we can see in Figure 4B, F19A and S72A

443

have their ability to interact with nsp14 reduced, whereas G69A, H80A and Y96A have

444

apparently completely lost their ability to interact with nsp14 WT in these conditions.

445

According to our homology model represented in Figure 4D, the alanine substitutions

446

affect the binding between nsp10 and nsp14 in different ways. The F19A mutation seems

447

to weaken the van der Waals interactions of nsp10 with the helix H4 of the nsp14 (Figure

448

4D). This can represent the loss of an important hydrophobic effect at the interface of the

449

two proteins. On one end, this helix is part of the framework that keeps key catalytic

450

residues and an Mg2+ ion in place in the ExoN active site, whereas the other end is

451

extended by a loop that forms a zinc finger that is crucial for the structural stability of the

452

nsp14 from SARS-CoV [17]. The binding of nsp10 to this region avoids the exposure of

453

hydrophobic amino acids to the solvent and helps the stabilization of the protein structure.

454

The residue G69 is located in a known structural motif that links the nsp10 sheet β2 to

455

the helix H3 (Figure 4D). This motif is part of an extensive region of intermolecular

456

interactions between nsp10 and nsp14 that also helps on the stabilization of the ExoN

457

domain [16]. The presence of a glycine amino acid in this position also allows for the

458

accommodation of the carbonyl group of nsp14 P20. In this scenario, the mutation G69A

459

is likely to cause local changes to the nsp10 secondary structure and to create unfavorable

460

interactions with P20 and, thus, may interfere on the fitting between nsp10 and nsp14.

461

This same region contains the residues S72, H80 and Y96, which participate in the

462

network of polar interactions that connects nsp10 to nsp14. Specifically, residue H80

463

forms a salt-bridge with nsp14 D126 (Figure 4D) while residue Y96 keeps a hydrogen

464

bond with the carboxyl group of nsp14 D141 (Figure 4D). Residue S72 is a special case

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.425745; this version posted January 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

465

as it makes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of nsp14 residues A23 and P24 (Figure

466

4D). Thus, the substitution of these residues by alanine breaks intra and intermolecular

467

interactions that may be important not only for the binding between nsp10 and nsp14 but

468

also to maintain their secondary structure.

469

Taken together, these mutations on nsp10 are prone to interfere on the interaction of this

470

protein with nsp14. Evidence points to a stabilization role of nsp10 on the nsp14 structure

471

and, thus, mutations that alter the binding between these proteins may disrupt the structure

472

of the nsp14 ExoN domain and decrease its activity [16; 17].

473

Since any alteration on the binding ability of nsp10 to nsp14 might modify the capacity

474

of nsp14 ExoN to efficiently cleave RNA, we have also analyzed the effect of these nsp10

475

mutations on the activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Time-course in vitro assays with

476

5’-end labelled H4 RNA were performed in the presence of nsp10 WT or mutants (Figure

477

4C), using the 1:4 nsp14-nsp10 ratio as described above. All the nsp10 substitutions tested

478

severely affected the nsp14 ExoN activity. Full disappearance of the RNA substrate was

479

not detected even 60 minutes after incubation with any of the nsp10 variants, contrarily

480

to that verified with the nsp10 WT, which allowed total degradation of the full-length

481

RNA in 15 min. The major degradation products obtained from these reactions range

482

between 19 and 20 nts, which correspond to cleavage in the ds-region of H4 RNA,

483

observed for nsp14 alone, and no further progression is observed (Figure 4C). The most

484

striking result was obtained with the S72A derivative that not only completely lost the

485

ability to stimulate the exoribonucleolytic activity of nsp14, but partially compromise the

486

basal ExoN activity of nsp14.

487

Overall, our results show that all nsp10 mutants have reduced nsp14 affinity when

488

compared to the WT protein, with consequences for the stimulation effect on nsp14 ExoN

489

activity (Figures 4B and C). In agreement with this, the nsp10 F19A, G69A, S72A, H80A

490

and Y96A mutants were also shown to affect nsp14-nsp10 interaction in SARS-CoV, and

491

resulted in a low nsp14 ExoN activity, suggesting an important role for these residues in

492

nsp14 recognition and interaction [24]. These results reinforce the idea that a stable

493

interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is strictly required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN

494

activity of SARS-CoV-2.

495
496

ExoN motif I has a prominent role on the RNase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14

497

SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 also has a high similarity with nsp14 from SARS-CoV (95% of

498

sequence identity and 99.1% of sequence similarity), and less conservation with the

499

amino acid sequence of MERS (Figure 5A). As a bimodular protein, the amino acids 1–

500

290 from SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 fold into the ExoN domain, and the amino acids 291–527

501

form the N7-MTase domain (Figures 3). In nsp14 the differences are spread punctually

502

over the protein structure. However, none of these positions are inside the MTase or the

503

ExoN active sites. The ExoN activity depends on the conserved DEEDh motif, which is

504

part of the active site (Figure 5A) [13; 16; 26]. These conserved active site residues were

505

found to be distributed over three canonical motifs (I, II, and III). The SARS-CoV-2

506

residues D90/E92 (motif I), D243 (motif II) and D273 (motif III) are fully conserved in

507

the three CoVs represented. Amino acid residues E92, D243 and D273 form an

508

electrophilic environment that is important for substrate binding and catalysis on nsp14

509

of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5B). Additionally, E92 is probably responsible for the

510

coordination of the second Mg2+ ion necessary for the reaction. It may also form a

511

hydrogen bond with H268, which is another key residue that anchors the substrates. We

512

have constructed and purified nsp14 mutants with single substitutions of these conserved

513

catalytic residues by the neutrally charged alanine (D90A, E92A, D243A and D273A)

514

(Figure S1). We conducted activity assays using these variants in order to assess the role

515

of these amino acids in the ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14. The SARS-CoV and

516

MERS nsp14 studies available so far reported that substitution of ExoN catalytic residues

517

by alanine have a large impact in their exoribonucleolytic activity [15; 16; 17; 26]. As

518

shown in Figure 5C, mutations on these residues influenced the ExoN activity of SARS-

519

CoV-2 nsp14. E92A substitution had the most striking effect, presenting only residual

520

exoribonuclease activity. Although to a less extent, the D90A mutant was also severely

521

deficient in their ability to degrade RNA and rendered a major product of 19 nts. These

522

results demonstrate the importance of residues from motif I (D90 and E92) for the activity

523

of nsp14. In contrast, mutations in aspartates from motifs II and III (D243A and D273A,

524

respectively) led to a modest reduction in the ExoN activity, both being able to fully

525

degrade the full-length RNA after 60 min of incubation (Figure 5C). However, the

526

cleavage patterns generated with both mutants were different. The nsp14 D273A version

527

yielded products ranging between 17- and 20-nts (more similar to that of WT), whereas

528

the D243A mutant generated major products between 18- and 20-nts. However, this

529

mutant version was able to go further in the degradation since smaller minor products

530

could be detected (Figure 5C).

531

Due to the extra role of the motif I E92 residue, it is likely that the substitution E92A

532

causes a major impact on the catalysis compared to the mutations D243A and D273A.

533

The residue D90 also coordinates an Mg2+ ion (Figure 5A), but surprisingly the impact of

534

the mutation D90A was not as severe as the observed on E92A. Probably the presence of

535

the residue E191 may be sufficient to keep the Mg2+ ion in the active site, attenuating the

536

effects of the D90A substitution. This behavior is consistent with the data from SARS-

537

CoV that shows that the E191 mutation is more likely to affect the ExoN activity than the

538

mutation D90A [17].

539

In general, our observations contrast with the results obtained for SARS-CoV, and

540

recently for MERS [15; 16; 17; 26]. In the closely related SARS-CoV, the frequently used

541

motif I-double substitution D90A/E92A resulted in a major reduction of ExoN activity,

542

whereas the motif II D243A and motif III D273A mutations completely abrogated the

543

ExoN activity [16; 17; 26]. Also in MERS, both D90A and E92A substitutions appeared

544

to be slightly less detrimental than D273A, even though all of them resulted in almost

545

complete loss of ExoN activity [15]. The results here reported revealed some differences

546

on the functionality of the conserved catalytic residues D90, E92E, D243 and D273 from

547

nsp14 ExoN, which can be related with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

548
549

Nsp14 N7-MTase Activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity

550

As already mentioned, nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme with both ExoN and N7-MTase

551

activities, connected by a hinge region that modulates the flexibility of the protein (Figure

552

3). The C-terminal MTase domain of nsp14 was found to be able to methylate cap

553

analogues or GTP substrates, in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as methyl

554

donor [18; 36]. In this work, we have established an in vitro assay with purified SARS-

555

CoV-2 nsp14 to test its N7-MTase activity, using capped 30-mer G*ppp-RNA as

556

substrate (Figure 6). An nsp14 D331A mutant was constructed and used as a negative

557

control due to its reported involvement in the binding of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-

558

methionine (SAM) in SARS-CoV [16; 18; 36]. The level of cap methyltransferase activity

559

of nsp14 was evaluated by the conversion of G*pppRNA to m7G*pppRNA during the

560

cap methyltransferase reaction in TLC analysis. Subsequent P1 digestion of the RNA

561

substrates to individual nucleotides gives the ratio of m7G*pppG spot compared to

562

G*pppG on the TLC plate phosphor image. SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 was able to methylate

563

the G*pppG cap of RNAs since we can observe, in the corresponding lane, a main spot

564

that co-migrates with m7G*pppG marker (Figure 6A). In contrast, treatment of

565

G*pppRNA with nsp14 D331A mutant did not generate a similar product on the TLC

566

plate (Figure 6A). Instead, it gives a nucleotide product that co-migrates with G*pppG

567

marker resultant from the digestion of G*pppRNA with P1 nuclease.

568

To evaluate if the nsp14 ExoN activity has any influence on the SARS-CoV-2 MTase

569

activity, the point mutations located in the conserved motifs of the ExoN domain (D90A,

570

E92A, D243A and D273A) were also tested for their capacity to methylate the

571

G*pppRNA in the presence of SAM. As shown in Figure 6B, none of these substitutions

572

influence nsp14 MTase activity, in line with [36].

573

It has been reported that nsp10 exclusively interacts with the ExoN domain of nsp14

574

without perturbing the N7-MTase activity [16; 37]. In fact, our results demonstrate that

575

nsp14 presents a robust MTase activity in the absence of nsp10, similar to the one

576

observed with the nsp14-nsp10 complex (data not shown).

577

From this part of the work we can conclude that the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2

578

nsp14 functions as an MTase, and that this domain is functionally independent of the

579

D90A, E92A, D243A and D273A ExoN catalytic residues. The nsp14 MTase activity

580

also seems to be independent on the presence of nsp10 cofactor, contrarily to nsp14 ExoN.

Discussion

584

The 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) encoded by the coronavirus genome (ORF1a/1b)

585

are involved in viral replication and represent potential targets for antiviral drug

586

discovery. Among these, nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme that harbors both N-terminal

587

ExoN and C-terminal N7-MTase activities [17; 18; 26]. The combination of both

588

activities is unique for coronaviruses. Its ExoN activity is stimulated through the

589

interaction with other non-structural protein, nsp10, which constitutes a critical regulator

590

of viral RNA synthesis and degradation. Due to the central role of the nsp14-nsp10

591

complex, we have performed a detailed characterization of these proteins from SARS-

592

CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

593

Nsp10 residues involved in the interaction with nsp14 were found to be essential for

594

SARS-CoV and MHV replication [24; 33]. This reflects the importance of the nsp10-

595

nsp14 interaction surface in coronaviruses. Our results indicate that the same is valid for

596

SARS-CoV-2, since nsp14 only shows a weak ExoN activity in the absence of nsp10,

597

which is strongly enhanced upon interaction with nsp10 (also observed in [27]). We have

598

further established that the concentration ratio for the nsp10/nsp14 complex of SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.425745; this version posted January 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

599

CoV-2 is 4:1, as this yielded maximal ExoN activity. The same ratio was observed for

600

SARS-CoV [16].

601

Although the 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is not yet solved,

602

our work gave the first insights into important SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 residues directly

603

involved in the interaction with nsp14. This is here demonstrated by the SPR data, as

604

inferred by the homology model done on the basis of the SARS-CoV experimentally

605

determined structure, and the high sequence identity between the proteins from the two

606

viruses. We demonstrate that mutations in the nsp10 F19, G69, S72, H80 and Y96 amino

607

acids residues have deleterious consequences for the nsp14 ExoN activity in vitro, which

608

could be rationalized by the structural effects that these mutations have in the formation

609

of the nsp10-nsp14 heterodimer. Therefore, we infer that a stable interaction between

610

these two proteins is strictly required for the correct functioning of nsp14 ExoN activity

611

of SARS-CoV-2. Nsp10 mutations that disrupted the nsp10-nsp14 interaction were lethal

612

for MHV and SARS-CoV, but the inactivation of the ExoN domain was not. However,

613

this domain was found to be essential for the viability of SARS-CoV-2 (and also MERS)

614

[15; 24; 33; 38; 39]. Thus, the nsp14 ExoN activity might have a predominant role on

615

SARS-CoV-2 life-cycle.The role of nsp10 is reinforced by its pleiotropic function during

616

viral replication. Additionally to nsp14, nsp10 is also responsible for stimulating the

617

nsp16 2’-O-MTase activity [20]. Nsp14 and nsp16 share a common interaction surface

618

with nsp10. Some residues here identified as crucial for SARS-CoV-2 ExoN activation,

619

have already been recognised as essential for nsp16 2′-O-MTase activity [16; 24; 40].

620

Y96 targets both the nsp10-nsp14 and nsp10-nsp16 interactions in SARS-CoV [24]. The

621

same seems to be valid for SARS-CoV-2 based in our results in vitro and on the crystal

622

structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex recently solved [41]. An alanine substitution in the

623

residue S72 of nsp10, which has also been reported to be involved in SARS-CoV nsp10-

624

nsp16 and nsp10-nsp14 interactions [24], resulted in a total loss of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10

625

ability to stimulate the exoribonucleolytic activity of nsp14. This mutant even seems to

626

compromise the nsp14 basal activity, usually observed in the absence of nsp10.

627

Therefore, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 could have an impact on several steps of

628

viral RNA synthesis.

629

Our results highlighted nsp10 as a potential target for antiviral drug development. We

630

propose some nsp10 residues that can be targeted to disrupt both the nsp14-nsp10 and the

631

nsp16-nsp10 complexes, leading simultaneously to inhibition of ExoN and 2′-O-MTase

632

activities. Because this protein is highly conserved among CoVs, molecules developed to

633

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 interaction surface might be extended to other coronaviruses.

634

To support this, Ogando and colleages [15] reported the interchangeability of nsp10

635

between SARS-CoV and MERS. Indeed, the nsp10-derived peptide TP29, which was

636

developed to target MHV nsp16 2’-O-MTase activity, successfully suppressed SARS-

637

CoV replication in cell culture [42]. Importantly, nsp10 may be targeted by inhibitors

638

with minimum cross-reactivity with human proteins, since no structures with a fold

639

similar to nsp10 were found in prokaryotes or eukaryotes [32].

640

We have also looked into the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues for the ExoN

641

activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14. Our results revealed that both motif I D90 and E92 amino

642

acids are strictly required for the RNase activity of this protein, whereas mutations on

643

motif II D243 and motif III D273 do not play such an important role. Thus, we would

644

expect that D90 and E92 residues may have a large impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication.

645

All the nsp14 D90A/E92A, D243A and 273A substitutions that impaired SARS-CoV

646

ExoN activity in vitro, also displayed drastic effects in vivo. Less accumulation of viral

647

RNA, defects in the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs, and a failure to recover infectious

648

viral progeny was observed in HCoV 229E [26]. The same mutations abrogated

649

detectable RNA synthesis and gave rise to nonviable MERS-CoV [15].

650

The most explored role of nsp14 ExoN so far is the repairing of mismatches that may be

651

introduced during CoVs RNA synthesis. This capability has also been proposed to be

652

responsible for the excision of nucleoside analogs that are incorporated into RNA, and

653

lead to premature termination of viral RNA replication and survival [38; 39; 43; 44].

654

Thus, the inhibition of nsp14 ExoN proofreading may potentiate the effect of nucleoside-

655

based inhibitors, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir [45; 46]. It was previously seen that

656

SARS-CoV and MHV mutants lacking nsp14 ExoN activity exhibited increased

657

susceptibility to nucleoside inhibitors [24; 38; 39; 43; 44]. In particular, an MHV deficient

658

in ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to Remdesivir [45]. For these

659

reasons, the combination of nucleoside analogs with nsp14 inhibitors may be more

660

effective. As such, our biochemical results may be very important for the design of new

661

molecules to inhibit the ExoN activity from SARS-CoV-2, which should be targeting the

662

two important residues for catalysis, D90 and E92. These indications, together with the

663

lack of sequence homology with the human proteome [47], makes nsp14 an excellent

664

druggable protein.

665

Pathogenic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm have evolved mechanisms to facilitate

666

infection of mammalian cells. These include the generation of cap structures on their

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.425745; this version posted January 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

667

RNA through methyltransferases (MTases) [48]. In this study, we have demonstrated for

668

the first time the nsp14 N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV-2. This activity is a key factor

669

for equipping viral mRNAs with a functional 5’-terminal cap structure in order to be

670

recognized by the cellular translation machinery. Unmethylated capped RNAs can induce

671

antiviral innate immune responses [49; 50]. Here, we have reported that the nsp14 D331A

672

substitution affects nsp14 MTase activity, which lost the capacity to methylate a capped

673

RNA transcript to generate cap-0

674

special interest as a target of putative drugs.

675

Besides viral life cycle, nsp14 can also influence the immune response of the host cells.

676

During the replication process of CoVs, the generated dsRNA intermediates are known

677

to activate the type I interferon (IFN-I) response [51]. Nsp14 was indeed identified as one

678

of the most potent interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2 [52]. In the present work,

679

our results revealed the ability of nsp14 ExoN to cleave dsRNA. Thus, this protein may

680

be involved in the degradation of viral dsRNA replication intermediates, hindering the

681

activation of the host innate immune response. This hypothesis was already pointed for

682

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [15; 16].

683

As reported for other CoVs, our results also confirm that the 3’-5’ exoribonucleolytic

684

activity of nsp14 is dependent on metal ions, preferentially Mg2+ over Mn2+, Co2+ and

685

Zn2+ promote residual activity, whereas Ca2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ did not support catalysis. It

686

is tempting to speculate on divalent metals availability as major environmental

687

determinants of the RNase activity of nsp14 in vivo. In this regard, alteration of ion

688

homeostasis in favor of infection has been already demonstrated in several viral systems,

689

including in SARS-CoV and MERS [53]. Even trace metals such as zinc and copper are

690

known to influence the course and the outcome of a variety of viral infections [54].

691

More experimentation and structure information is nonetheless required to fully

692

understand the precise functional and structural role of individual residues in SARS-CoV-

693

2 nsp10 and nsp14 proteins. The determination of the 3D structure of the nsp10/nsp14

694

complex will be also helpful to increase our knowledge about the synergies between these

695

proteins and to validate our findings. Also, the effect of the nsp14 and nsp10 mutations

696

here described should be employed in a reverse genetic approach in SARS-CoV-2 to

697

study viral replication and transcription.

698

It was already demonstrated that CoVs ExoN activity of nsp14, which is stimulated by

699

nsp10, constitutes a critical regulator of viral RNA synthesis and degradation. Our results

700

pinpoint the residues that are crucial for the complex formation and ExoN activity, which

may be very important to discover new inhibitors that may be used to treat COVID-19

and other diseases caused by other CoVs.
