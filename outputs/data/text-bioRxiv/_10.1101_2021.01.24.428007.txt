Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is the sole viral protein responsible for both

31

viral binding to a host cell and the membrane fusion event needed for cell entry. In

32

addition to facilitating fusion needed for viral entry, S can also drive cell-cell fusion, a

33

pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. While several

34

studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of

35

S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. We demonstrate that

36

S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion, and that

37

mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the

38

S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the

39

internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S cell-cell fusion.

40

Additionally, we examine S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of

41

mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for

42

SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the

43

S trimer. This work therefore offers insight into S stability, proteolytic processing, and

44

factors that mediate S cell-cell fusion, all of which help give a more comprehensive

45

understanding of this highly sought-after therapeutic target.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative

49

viral agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic.

50

Thus far, COVID-19 has impacted over 86 million people globally, resulting in the death

51

of more than one and a half million individuals [1]. Due to the widespread global impact

52

of this pandemic, a concerted effort has been made to rapidly develop a vaccine or

53

antiviral treatment.

54

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the major transmembrane glycoprotein

55

studding the surface of the viral particle, and is exclusively responsible for viral

56

attachment and cell entry, thus making it the major target of current vaccine strategies

57

and antiviral therapeutics [2]. The S protein consists of two distinct subunits: the S1

58

subunit, which binds to the known host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2

59

(ACE2) [3-11], and the S2 subunit that promotes the viral-to-host cell membrane fusion

60

event needed for viral infection [2, 8, 12-18]. Most known coronavirus (CoV) S proteins

61

undergo two post-translational proteolytic cleavage events, one at the border of the S1

62

and S2 subunits, and one downstream within the S2 subunit (termed S2’) [2, 13, 15-21].

63

Similar to several other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 likely utilizes bats as a reservoir

64

species, specifically Rhinolophus affinis or horseshoe bats [11, 22-25]. SARS-CoV-2

65

has 96% sequence identity to a CoV found in this bat population, RaTG13, with limited

66

differences between them [25]. One difference is the polybasic, PRRA, insertion at the

67

S1/S2 border which gives this site the canonical sequence requirements for cleavage by

68

the cellular proprotein convertase furin [26-29]. This change may be a key factor in the

69

zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of a furin consensus sequence at

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428007; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

70

the cleavage site has been observed in other human infecting CoVs [26, 30-32],

71

including highly pathogenic forms of influenza [33, 34] and previous studies have

72

demonstrated its functional significance. For SARS-CoV-2, the insertion is suggested to

73

allow for expanded cellular tropism and infectivity [13, 26, 35, 36]. For most CoVs,

74

cleavage at a downstream S2’ site may be carried out by a number of cellular

75

proteases, including serine proteases like transmembrane serine protease 2

76

(TMPRSS2), or endopeptidases, including members of the cathepsin family [13, 14, 19-

77

21].

78

Following receptor binding by the S1 subunit and priming by proteolytic cleavage,

79

the S2 subunit of S promotes the critical membrane fusion step of viral entry by

80

undergoing dynamic conformational changes to promote merging of the viral and host

81

cell membranes [10, 35, 37]. For entry of SARS-CoV-2, cleavage at the S1/S2 border

82

(by furin or a similar protease), is critical for TMPRSS2 cleavage and entry at the

83

plasma membrane. However, when S1/S2 border cleavage is blocked, viral entry can

84

be mediated through endosomal compartments with proteolytic cleavage carried out by

85

a member of the cathepsin family, similar to the entry pathway of SARS-CoV [10, 35,

86

37-39]. In addition to promoting virus-cell fusion during viral particle entry, S can also

87

promote cell-cell fusion, a pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of COVID-19 patients

88

where neighboring cells fuse together to form large multi-nucleated cells, termed

89

syncytia [40-45]. While the role of cellular proteases and S cleavage in viral entry is

90

being extensively investigated, insight into the cleavage requirements for cell-cell fusion

91

in SARS-CoV-2 remains more limited. Recent studies have suggested that S cleavage

92

at the S1/S2 border is critical for cell-cell fusion, and TMPRSS2, while not required,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428007; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

93

appears to enhance this cell-cell fusion [37, 40, 46, 47]. However, relatively little is

94

known about the timing and efficiency of these cleavage events, and how mutations in S

95

may affect the process.

96

Though CoVs mutate at a slower rate than most RNA viruses due to the

97

presence of viral proofreading machinery, a meta-analysis of genomes of SARS-CoV-2

98

strains found several mutations within S circulating in significant percentages of the

99

analyzed populations [48, 49]. The most common mutation, now found in most of the

100

global population, is an aspartate to glycine mutation at residue 614 (D614G) in the S1

101

subunit. Additional mutations throughout the S1 and S2 subunits of S have been found

102

in a smaller percentage of the viral population. Since S2 contains the fusion machinery,

103

mutations in this region may have an impact on overall protein stability and fusion.

104

Understanding the effects of mutations in this region will allow for a more

105

comprehensive understanding of the overall S function.

106

We tested wild-type (wt) SARS-CoV-2 S and variants in different host cell strains

107

to analyze the effects on stability, proteolytic processing, and cell-cell fusion. Here we

108

demonstrate that furin cleavage of S at the S1/S2 border is required for efficient cell-cell

109

fusion, and that the presence of TMPRSS2 in target cells enhances S mediated cell-cell

110

fusion, consistent with previous studies [37, 46]. We also show that mutations of the

111

cleavage sites at the S1/S2 border, S2’ site, or a cathepsin L (cath L) cleavage site,

112

conserved from SARS-CoV S, all reduce initial cleavage at the S1/S2 border during viral

113

protein synthesis, suggesting that mutations downstream of the S1/S2 border likely alter

114

the overall conformation of the protein. Additionally, we identify two S2 subunit

115

residues, one in the internal fusion peptide and another in the cytoplasmic tail, that alter

116

protein fusion function when mutated without changing overall protein expression and

117

cleavage, providing more insight into regions of the protein important for the regulation

118

of the fusion process. Finally, we demonstrate protein turnover and cleavage kinetics in

119

a range of host cells, as well as in the presence of several exogenous proteases,

120

providing a more comprehensive picture of the S protein.

Results
Stability and proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike in Various Cell Lines
To examine the stability and cleavage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 S in a range of

124

mammalian cell lines, the following cells were transiently transfected with pCAGGS-S:

125

Vero, A549, MEFs, Cath L- MEFS, and LoVo cells (a human colon carcinoma line that

126

does not express functional furin). Stability of S and the timing of proteolytic processing

127

were determined by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation. S protein detected

128

from immunoprecipitation was observed as two bands, a band around 150 kDa

129

corresponding to an un-cleaved full-length species of the protein, labeled S, and a band

130

around 97 kDa corresponding to a species of S cleaved at the border of the S1 and S2

131

subunits, labeled S2 (Fig. 1a). After a one-hour chase, a band corresponding to S2 was

132

observed in Vero, A549, and both MEF cell lines (Fig. 1a). In LoVo cells, a band

133

corresponding to the S2 subunit did not appear until four hours of chase, verifying that

134

lack of furin impedes efficient processing at S1/S2, and that the S1/S2 border can be

135

cleaved by cellular protease other than furin (Fig. 1a) in a slower and less efficient

136

process. Veros, A549s, MEFs, and Cath L- MEFs displayed similar cleavage patterns

137

over time, while LoVo cells displayed significantly less cleavage at two and four hours.

138

LoVo cells had only 2% cleavage at two hours and 18% cleavage at four hours,

139

compared to about 20-40% at two hours and 30-60% at four hours for all other cell

140

types (p<0.05). However, LoVo cells reached cleavage levels similar to the other cell

141

lines at later chase time points (Fig. 1b). Bands smaller than 90 kDa that would

142

correspond to cleavage at the S2’ site were not observed in any cell line. In the

143

examined cell lines, expressed S remained stable through the first four hours (Fig. 1c).

144

By 24 hours post label, only 20-30% of the original labeled protein remained for all cell

145

lines.

146

Several studies have examined the cellular proteases involved in the cleavage of

147

S. Furin and TMPRSS2 appear to play key roles in cleavage at the S1/S2 border and

148

S2’ site, respectively [26, 35, 50-52]. Additionally, lysosomal proteases such as cath L/B

149

can be utilized for viral entry in TMPRSS2 deficient cells [10, 38, 46]. To examine how

150

higher expression levels of these proteases affect S stability and cleavage, Vero and

151

A549 cells were transiently transfected with S alone or S with TMPRSS2, furin, or cath

152

L. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that the transient expression of TMPRSS2 or

153

cath L did not affect the cleavage pattern of S (Fig. 1d and 1e, S1b), and a band

154

corresponding to S2’ cleavage was not observed in either Veros or A549s. However,

155

transient over-expression of furin increased the cleavage observed at the S1/S2 border

156

in Veros at four and eight hours of chase (p<0.05) and at all times after zero for A549s

157

(p<0.01 for one- and eight-hour chase, p<0.0001 for two- and four-hour chase times)

158

(Fig. 1e and 1f). This suggests that the normal levels of cellular furin can eventually

159

promote maximal levels of S1/S2 cleavage in both Veros and A549s, but over-

160

expression of furin facilitates more rapid cleavage of the S1/S2 border. Interestingly, in

161

both experiments (Fig. 1a and 1d) some un-cleaved S remains even after 24 hours,

162

indicating that a small portion of the S population is not cleaved by furin or other

163

endogenous proteases in these cell lines. Finally, overall protein stability was not

164

affected by co-expression of any tested proteases (Fig. S1b).

165

Spike Mediated Cell-Cell Fusion

166

The S2 subunit of S mediates both viral-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion [40-42],

167

with cell-cell fusion readily observed both in a laboratory setting and in the lungs of

168

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [40-45]. To better understand the requirements and

169

contribution of cellular proteases to S2 mediated cell-cell fusion, we performed syncytia

170

and reporter gene assays. For syncytia analysis, a small number of syncytia, were

171

observed at 24 hpt in all samples (Fig. 2a). At 48 hpt, similar numbers of large syncytia

172

were observed with S alone or S co-expressed with TMPRSS2 or cath L (Fig. 2b).

173

However, co-expression of S with furin resulted in increased syncytia formation. The

174

cells exhibited nearly complete fusion, suggesting that the presence of exogenous furin

175

further increases S mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig. 2b, panel 3).

176

To quantitate S mediated cell-cell fusion, luciferase reporter gene fusion assays

177

were performed (Fig. S2a), using a nine hour overlay that was determined to be optimal

178

(Fig. S2b). To characterize the role of cellular proteases in the hACE2 expressing target

179

cells, S-expressing effector cells were overlaid with target cells containing hACE2 alone

180

or hACE2 with TMPRSS2, furin, or cath L. The amount of plasmid transfected was kept

181

constant by supplementing with a plasmid encoding an empty expression vector (EV).

182

When Vero cells were used as the S-expressing effector cell and TMPRSS2 was

183

present in the target cells, a significant increase in fusion was observed. This is

184

consistent with the concept that TMPRSS2 plays a role in fusion after or during the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428007; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

185

hACE2 (receptor) binding step in the fusion cascade (Fig. 2c) [10, 12, 32, 37, 46],

186

although the presence of TMPRSS2 in these target cells also appeared to process

187

hACE2 (Fig. S2c, also observed in[40]). In samples with cath L or furin in the target

188

cells, fusion levels were similar to hACE2+EV (Fig. 2c). When A549 cells were used as

189

the S-expressing effector cell, none of the conditions produced statistically significant

190

differences from background levels (Fig. 2c), so Vero cells were used as the effector

191

cells for the remainder of the experiments performed.

192

Having analyzed the function of proteases in the target cells, we were also

193

interested in the role of proteases present in the S-expressing effector cells. To test

194

this, EV, TMPRSS2, cath L, or furin were co-expressed with S and samples were

195

overlaid with target cells expressing hACE2. Similar to what we observed in syncytia

196

assays, only co-expression of S and furin produced a statistically significant increase in

197

fusion. This increase is likely due to the increase in the amount of cleaved protein

198

present when S is co-expressed with furin (Fig. 1e).

199

Neuropilin-1 has been suggested as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 S and may

200

be important for the viral infection infiltrating the neuronal network [53-55]. To assess

201

the contribution of neuropilin in cell-cell fusion, effector cells were transfected with S and

202

either EV, furin, neuropilin, or furin and neuropilin (F+N). Target cells were transfected

203

with EV, hACE2, neuropilin, or hACE2 and neuropilin. However, no significant increase

204

in fusion was observed when neuropilin was present in either the target or effector cells

205

(Fig. 2e), suggesting that neuropilin does not appear to play a significant role in cell-cell

206

mediated fusion. Interestingly, when neuropilin is co-expressed in S containing effector

207

cells, there is no difference observed in fusion compared to samples with S+EV,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428007; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

208

suggesting that neuropilin also does not have an inhibitory effect (Fig. 2e). Additionally,

209

when neuropilin alone is expressed in the target cells, fusion levels above background

210

levels are not observed. This indicates that in cell-cell fusion, S binding hACE2 appears

211

to be the major interaction during the receptor attachment function.

212

Importance of CoV-2 cleavage sites

213

Early protein sequence analysis of CoV-2 S protein demonstrated the presence

214

of three potential cleavage sites [26]: a putative furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 border;

215

a conserved site 10 residues downstream from the S1/S2 border, shown to be cleaved

216

by cath L in SARS-CoV; and the S2’ site which is potentially cleaved by TMPRSS2 [26].

217

To functionally understand the role of each cleavage site in S cell-cell fusion, a series of

218

mutants were made. Alanine mutations of all the residues within each potential

219

cleavage site (S1/S2 AAAAA, Cath L AAAA, S2’ AA), and single alanine mutations at

220

the terminal arginine of the S1/S2 border and S2’ site (S1/S2 PRRAA, S2’ KA) were

221

created. Finally, a mutant with residues (PRRA) upstream of the S1/S2 border deleted

222

(del. PRRA), leaving a single R residue at this site, was made, creating an S1/S2 border

223

similar to SARS-CoV S (Fig. 3A). Pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 3b) showed that all

224

mutants had similar protein turnover compared to wt S in Veros. However, in A549s

225

several mutants demonstrated more rapid protein turnover than wt S at later chase time

226

points. Surprisingly, mutations at all three sites led to either a complete loss or

227

significant delay in the proteolytic processing of the S protein at the S1/S2 border,

228

indicated by the lack of a band corresponding to the S2 subunit. This suggests that

229

mutations at distal sites can strongly influence cleavage at S1/S2. After an eight-hour

230

chase, no cleavage at the S1/S2 border was observed for the mutants del. PRRA and

231

S1/S2 AAAAA, confirming that deletion or mutation of the furin consensus prevents

232

cleavage at this site. For all other mutants, cleavage at the S1/S2 border reached 30-

233

50% of wt levels in both Vero and A549 cells the eight-hour time point (Fig. 3c and 3d).

234

Accurate analysis of protein cleavage was not possible by the 24-hour time point, since

235

only 20-30% of protein remained (Fig. S1b). Finally, surface biotinylation showed that

236

both total and cell surface expression of all mutants were similar to wt S levels (Fig. 3e,

237

f, and g).

238

To assess the effects of the mutations on cell-cell fusion, syncytia formation

239

assays in Vero cells were performed. While syncytia were readily observed in all

240

samples containing wt S, none of the mutants exhibited syncytia formation at 24 or 48

241

hpt when expressed alone (Fig. S3, panel 2). Addition of TMPRSS2 did not recover

242

syncytia formation in any mutant (Fig. S3, panel 3), and the addition of furin only

243

recovered syncytia formation in the S1/S2 PRRAA mutant (Fig. S3, panel 4, syncytia

244

denoted with black arrows). To analyze this result, cells were lysed following the 48-

245

hour imaging and protein levels examined by western blot. Results showed that co-

246

expression of furin with the S1/S2 PRRAA mutant restored cleavage at the S1/S2

247

border, while all other mutants did not show cleavage at this site (data not shown). This

248

suggests that cleavage at the S1/S2 border is critical for cell-cell fusion, and that the

249

double R motif in the PRRAA mutant can be cleaved by over-expressed furin.

250

Luciferase reporter gene analysis of fusion in Veros transfected with wt S or each

251

mutant showed similar results to the syncytia assays, with none of the mutants showing

252

fusion levels above background (Fig. 3h). Interestingly, the S2’ AA mutant displayed

253

high background levels, suggesting this mutant may have a conformational change, or

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428007; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

254

characteristics that increase receptor binding or alter S2 trimeric association, leading to

255

higher background signals. Reporter gene assays were also carried out with addition of

256

transiently expressed furin in the S-expressing effector cells, but no significant

257

increases in fusion were observed. Since all cleavage mutants created reduced

258

cleavage at the S1/S2 subunit border, the reductions in cell-cell fusion may be

259

attributable to loss of cleavage at this site.

260

Effect of Circulating S Mutations on Protein Stability, Cleavage, and Fusion

261

An early examination revealed several mutations in the S protein gene in

262

circulating viral strains [48, 49], including the D614G substitution now found in most of

263

the global SARS-CoV-2 strains [48, 56-62]. The D614G mutation lies in the S1 subunit

264

of the protein, just downstream of the receptor binding domain, and is proposed to play

265

a critical role in receptor binding by alteration of the positioning of the receptor binding

266

domain. Other mutations in circulating strains were found throughout the S2 subunit

267

[49]. To assess the effect(s) of these mutations, we created the mutants D614G,

268

A831V, D839Y/N/E, S943P, and P1263L (Fig. 4a). Pulse-chase analysis in Veros and

269

A549s (Fig. 4b, c) demonstrated that all circulating mutants tested exhibited protein

270

turnover at similar rates as wt S in both cell lines (Fig. S1d). Surface biotinylation

271

confirmed that all tested mutants displayed total protein and surface protein levels

272

comparable to wt S, suggesting that none of the mutants caused major defects or

273

enhancement of protein trafficking to the cell surface (Fig. 4d, e). Syncytia formation

274

and evaluation of protein location by immunofluorescence were similar between all

275

mutants and wt S (Fig. S4). Interestingly, cellular extensions containing the S protein

276

were observed for the wt and each of the mutants (Fig. S4, white arrows) [63]. Finally,

277

luciferase reporter gene assays were performed. While most of the mutants displayed

278

fusion levels similar to wt S, three mutants exhibited significant changes (Fig. 4f).

279

D839Y and D839N displayed significantly reduced levels of fusion compared to wt

280

(p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), and P1263L showed a significant increase in fusion

281

compared to wt (p<0.05). These changes in fusion cannot be attributed to differences in

282

cell surface protein expression or cleavage levels, suggesting that residues near the

283

internal fusion peptide, where D839 is located, and residues in the cytoplasmic tail,

284

where P1263 is located, may play an important role in controlling the fusion cascade.

285

Trypsin accessibility and protein-protein association in select Spike mutants

286

Since all the S cleavage site mutants exhibited defects in cleavage at the S1/S2

287

border, we evaluated the accessibility of this site using a trypsin treatment assay to

288

determine if the lack of cleavage was due to misfolding in the S1/S2 border region.

289

Veros or A549s were transfected with wt S or each cleavage mutant and metabolically

290

labeled. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated and then cells were either left untreated

291

or treated with 0.3 µg/μl of TPCK-Trypsin prior to lysis. When treated with exogenous

292

TPCK-Trypsin, both the del. PRRA and S1/S2 PRRAA mutants were efficiently cleaved

293

at the S1/S2 border, shown by the appearance of a band corresponding to S2 in the

294

lanes treated with trypsin (Fig. 5a, quantified in Fig. 5b). This suggests that the

295

observed defects in cleavage at the S1/S2 border are not due to inaccessibility at the

296

site, but rather to the removal of the furin consensus sequence. Interestingly, mutations

297

at the downstream cath L or S2’ potential cleavage sites also render defects in protein

298

cleavage at the S1/S2 border site. However, treatment with exogenous trypsin did not

299

significantly affect the amount of cleavage observed, a result consistent with a change

300

in conformation that renders the S1/S2 border cleavage site inaccessible.

301

CoV S proteins associate as homo-trimers shortly after synthesis and remain in

302

this trimeric form throughout the fusion cascade [12, 15]. To determine if proteolytic

303

processing affects the stability of S trimer association, Veros or A549s transfected with

304

wt S or mutants D614G, S1/S2 AAAAA, S2’AA, or wt S plus additional furin, were

305

metabolically labeled. After lysis and immunoprecipitation, samples were then treated at

306

50°C or 100°C prior to separation on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. When wt S was

307

incubated at 50°C prior to separation, species that correspond to a full-length S

308

monomer, dimer, and trimer were observed (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, species that fall in

309

between sizes corresponding to a monomer, dimer, and trimer (Fig. 5c, red and purple

310

*) were also observed. These intermediate species may be the result of dimers or

311

trimers made up of a mixture of full-length S protomers and cleaved S protomers.

312

When wt S was incubated at 100°C prior to separation, bands corresponding only to full

313

length S monomer, dimer, trimers, and cleaved S2 monomers were apparent. Similar

314

results were also observed in D614G samples, suggesting that species containing

315

cleaved protomers may be less stable. Consistent with this data, the S1/S2 AAAAA

316

mutant, which cannot undergo cleavage at the S1/S2 border site, migrated primarily as

317

a trimeric species after 50°C incubation, with little monomer or dimer observed.

318

Additionally, when wt S was co-expressed with furin (shown to increase S cleavage in

319

Fig. 1e and 1f), the predominant observed species was monomeric, after both 50°C and

320

100°C incubation. Overall, these results suggest that cleavage at the S1/S2 border

321

alters the stability of S trimeric association.

322

Furin or furin-like proteases in bat cells can cleave the S1/S2 border of SARS-CoV-2

323

Spike

324

Rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bats have been identified as the likely reservoir

325

species for the novel SARS-CoV-2 [25]. To understand the proteolytic processing,

326

expression, and stability of CoV-2 S in a cell line closely related to its reservoir host, we

327

utilized Pteropus alecto fetus (pt. fetus) or lung (pt. lung) cells [64] that have a furin

328

enzyme with ~90% sequence homology to bats in the Rhinolopus family. Our previous

329

studies on paramyxovirus virus fusion protein cleavage have shown that efficient furin

330

and cathepsin cleavage occurs in these cells, although the furin cleavage occurs with

331

delayed kinetics compared to Veros or A549s [65].

332

Surface biotinylation demonstrated that wt S and the del. PRRA mutant were

333

readily expressed at the surface at similar levels in both cell lines, with cleavage at the

334

S1/S2 border only observed for wt S and not for the del. PRRA mutant (Fig. 6a and 6b).

335

Pulse-chase analysis showed that S expressed in both pt. lung and pt. fetus cells was

336

cleaved at the S1/S2 border by one hour, with cleavage extent reaching approximately

337

40% at eight-hours, and 60% at 24 hours (Fig. 6c and 6d). Thus, furin or other

338

proteases in P.alecto cells are able to process S, although this processing occurred

339

more slowly than in other mammalian cell lines (compare to Fig. 1b). Interestingly,

340

some cleavage was also observed in both pt. lung and pt. fetus cells for the del. PRRA

341

mutation (Fig. 6c and 6d). Additionally, the wt S and del. PRRA mutant were slightly

342

less stable in the P. alecto cells, demonstrating about 30-50% protein remaining at eight

343

hours, and about 20% at 24 hours (Fig. 6e). In contrast, previously used mammalian

344

cells lines showed 60-90% of wt S remained at eight hours, with 30-50% at 24 hours of

345

chase (Fig. 1c).

346

Discussion

347

In this study, we present a detailed characterization of the cleavage patterns,

348

protein stability, and cell-cell fusion function of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as well as

349

analysis of mutations within the S2 subunit that may affect these important protein

350

properties. Consistent with recently published work [26, 35, 47, 50, 51, 66], our analysis

351

confirms that S is readily cleaved at the S1/S2 border in a variety of mammalian cell

352

lines. Additionally, we show for the first time, that cleavage occurs in a bat cell line

353

similar to the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir species. While cleavage appears to be primarily

354

carried about by the cellular protease furin, the sequence at this border does have the

355

ability to be cleaved by other members of the pro-protein convertase family when furin is

356

not present [47], and this likely accounts for the small amount of cleavage we observed

357

in furin-negative LoVo cells.

358

Additionally, we carefully assessed the role different proteases play in cell-cell

359

fusion, finding that furin increases cell-cell fusion when present in the same cell as S,

360

and TMPRSS2 increases cell-cell fusion when present in a target cell, consistent with

361

previous studies [37, 46]. Interestingly, when cell-cell fusion assays were performed

362

using A549 cells as the effector cell (Fig. 2c), high background fusion levels were

363

observed. This could be due to high endogenous levels of TMPRSS2 in this cell line

364

compared to Veros, that were ultimately used for this experiment (Fig. S2c). High

365

TMPRSS2 expression or exogenous treatment with trypsin has been shown to restore

366

cell-cell fusion in low ACE2 receptor expression environments for SARS-CoV S [67, 68].

367

It is also worth noting that the presence of TMPRSS2 in the target (BSR/T7) cells also

368

appears to process hACE2 (Fig. S2c, [40]). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility

369

that the increase in fusion observed when TMPRSS2 is present in these cells is due to

370

an effect on hACE2. In addition to the effect of proteases on cell-cell fusion, we also

371

assessed the effect of Neuropilin-1, which has been suggested to be a co-receptor for

372

SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and may be key for SARS-CoV-2 infiltration of the neuronal

373

network [53-55]. We show that the presence of Neuropilin-1 with hACE2 in target cells

374

does not impact S mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig. 2e). Additionally, co-expressing

375

Neuropilin-1 with S in effector cells did not have an inhibitory effect on cell-cell fusion.

376

While reports suggest Neuropilin-1 plays a role in viral entry of SARS-CoV-2, this

377

indicates it does not play a significant role in S cell-cell fusion in our assay, although this

378

was not investigated in neuronal cells.

379

The viral entry and cell-cell fusion pathways of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and

380

SARS-CoV-2 have several noteworthy commonalities, but do have marked differences.

381

They all share the ability to facilitate entry through endosomal pathways, with S

382

proteolytic activation mediated by endosomal/lysosomal proteases [10, 19, 35, 37-39,

383

69-72]. Additionally, they all can utilize cell surface (such as TMPRSS2) or extracellular

384

proteases (trypsin) for S activation and subsequent viral entry [10, 37, 38, 47, 67, 72-

385

78]. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV S differ from SARS-CoV S in that their S1/S2 border

386

harbors a canonical furin cleavage motif [26, 27, 32], resulting in S pre-activation by

387

furin during synthesis and cellular trafficking, prior to reaching the cell surface or being

388

incorporated into viral particles [19, 35, 37, 39, 75]. This pre-activation by furin likely

389

enhances the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV S to participate in cell-cell

390

mediated fusion without over-expression of cell surface or extracellular proteases [37,

391

46]. Addition of this cleavage sequence in SARS-CoV S allows SARS-S to facilitate cell-

392

cell fusion without exogenous proteases [37, 79]. We show an increase in both syncytia

393

formation and luciferase reporter gene assay fusion when cleavage at the S1/S2 border

394

is enhanced by overexpression of furin (Fig. 2b and 2c), confirming that furin cleavage

395

of SARS-CoV-2 S plays a critical role in cell-cell fusion. Interestingly, furin cleavage is

396

not required for SARS-CoV-2 infection [10, 35, 37, 47], although removal of the site or

397

inhibition of furin does appear to attenuate the virus [35, 39, 47] and reduce cellular

398

tropism [46].

399

The presence of a furin consensus sequence is not only a marked difference

400

between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but it is also one of the differences between

401

SARS-CoV-2 and a similar CoV circulating in a bat population [25]. Analysis of SARS-

402

CoV-2 wt S in P. alecto cells demonstrates that this motif can be recognized and

403

cleaved by furin in these cells (Fig. 6c and 6d), although the kinetics of this cleavage are

404

noticeably slower than in other mammalian cell lines (compare to Fig. 1b). Previous

405

work has shown that the fusion proteins of Hendra virus, processed by cathepsins, and

406

parainfluenza virus 5, processed by furin, are also cleaved in P. alecto cells [65]. Pulse-

407

chase analysis in this prior study demonstrated an increase in processing kinetics,

408

although this kinetic difference can be accounted for by differences in protease

409

expression levels between different bat cell lines (pt. kidney cells in [65], and pt. lung

410

and pt. fetus cells in our work), suggesting there may be cellular differences in protein

411

trafficking or furin activity. Intriguingly, a CoV-2 S mutant with a deletion of the inserted

412

PRRA residues still demonstrated some cleavage in both utilized bat cell lines (Fig. 6c

413

and 6d), while not showing any in Veros or A549s (Fig. 3c and 3d). Earlier work on

414

MERS-CoV S showed that furin or other proprotein convertases in bat cells can process

415

MERS S S1/S2 border without the presence of a canonical recognition motif [80]. Taken

416

together, these results suggest that mutations in circulating bat CoVs that allow for

417

human protease recognition at critical cleavage sites may be an important factor for

418

zoonotic transmission of several CoVs.

419

Two other potential cleavage sites have been identified in work with other CoVs.

420

The S2’ site is essential for both SARS and MERS infection [12, 32, 81-83] while a cath

421

L activated site play a critical role for SARS-CoV S [13, 20, 84, 85]. Interestingly,

422

mutations made at the S2’ site of SARS-CoV-2 S significantly reduce S1/S2 border

423

cleavage, both in our study and others (Fig. 3b-d, [46, 86]), even though the sites are

424

distal from each other. A similar reduction in cleavage is observed when the conserved

425

cathepsin site is mutated (Fig. 3b-d). Our analysis of the published structures [3, 4, 87,

426

88] indicates that a full alanine mutation of this site may simply collapse the exposed

427

S1/S2 loop. Our finding that exogenous trypsin treatment of cells expressing the S2’ or

428

cathepsin site mutants does not restore cleavage at the S1/S2 border (Fig. 5a and 5b)

429

suggests that these mutations result in proteins with altered furin loop structure [87],

430

rendering it inaccessible. However, these mutants are still synthesized and trafficked to

431

the surface despite not being cleaved (Fig. 3e-g), thus this change in conformation is

432

unlikely to have drastically misfolded the protein. These results suggest that there may

433

be a dynamic interaction between the S1/S2 border and S2’ cleavage sites in SARS-

434

CoV-2 S needed to facilitate viral entry and cell-cell fusion. This dynamic control could

435

also be regulated by S receptor binding exposing cryptic protease sites, although

436

studies analyzing this in SARS and MERS S conflict on this topic [19, 70, 77, 89, 90].

437

We also assessed the effect on protein stability, cleavage, and cell-cell fusion

438

function of a series of mutations in other regions of S. The D614G mutation emerged

439

during 2020, and is now found in most circulating strains globally [48]. D614G has been

440

shown to increase S incorporation into viral particles [91], increase receptor binding [92,

441

93], and reduce S1 subunit shedding and particle infectivity [94]. Importantly, the

442

D614G mutant shifts S to favor a “heads up” conformation of the receptor binding

443

domain [93, 95, 96]. In our study, the D614G mutation did not impact the cell-cell fusion

444

function (Fig. 4f), expression, or stability of the protein (Fig. 4d/e, and Fig. S1),

445

consistent with one previous study [86]. Our fusion results however conflict with two

446

previous studies that demonstrated D614G increases cell-cell fusion, measured by cell

447

depletion in flow cytometry [92], and syncytia formation in 293T and Hela cells stably

448

expressing hACE2 [97]. These discrepancies may be due to differences in

449

experimental conditions or cell types utilized. We are, however, the first to date to

450

utilize a luciferase reporter gene assay to quantitate cell-cell fusion of a D614G S

451

mutant. Using this assay, we also show that mutations found at two other residues

452

(discovered in small, non-dominant population subsets [49]) alter the cell-cell fusion

453

activity of S (Fig. 4f) without changing the overall protein expression or stability levels

454

(Fig. 4d-e, Fig. S1d). Mutations at D839, a residue within the internal fusion peptide, to

455

the polar amino acids, tyrosine or asparagine, significantly reduce fusion. Interestingly,

456

a mutation at this residue that conserves the negative charge, D839E, has no effect on

457

fusion activity. The negative charge at this residue may play a role in the regulation of S

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428007; this version posted January 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

458

mediated fusion due to its location in the internal fusion peptide. Alternatively, this

459

residue is in close proximity to C840, which may participate in a disulfide bond, so

460

mutations at D839 may disrupt this disulfide bond, destabilizing the protein and

461

changing fusion activity. Additionally, mutation of residue P1263 to a leucine

462

significantly increases S mediated cell-cell fusion, suggesting that residues in the

463

cytoplasmic tail may play a role in the S-promoted cell-cell fusion process. Notably, a

464

study that removed the entire S cytoplasmic tail still observed syncytia formation at

465

levels similar to wt S [86], indicating that regulation by the cytoplasmic tail may be

466

complex or that the role of the cytoplasmic tail in fusion is not regulation, but interaction

467

with cellular host factors [98].

468

In this work, we also provide critical insight into the kinetics of protein cleavage

469

and overall stability of CoV-2 S. S protein processing at the S1/S2 border occurs within

470

two hours of synthesis (Fig. 1a and 1b; one hour of label, one hour of chase) in several

471

mammalian cell lines (Vero, MEF, A549), and continues to increase over time, reaching

472

60-80% protein cleavage by eight hours of chase time, depending on the cell type.

473

Overexpression of furin increased the efficiency of S1/S2 border cleavage (Fig. 1d-f),

474

and this increase in cleavage may account for the increase in cell-cell fusion observed

475

when furin is co-expressed with S (Fig. 2a-c, [37, 46]). Additionally, we show that

476

transiently transfected S is stable in several mammalian cells for 4-5 hours post-protein

477

synthesis with demonstrable turnover after this point, (Fig. 1c, Fig. S1). This protein

478

turnover is similar to turnover rates seen in PIV5 fusion protein, also activated by

479

cellular furin [99], and slightly slower turnover than Hendra fusion protein, activated by

480

cellular cathepsins [100, 101]. Over-expression of cellular proteases that may process

481

S did not affect these protein turnover rates. Interestingly, analysis of S in non-reducing

482

conditions found that cleavage of the S1/S2 border appears to destabilize trimeric

483

interactions (Fig. 5b). In these non-reducing conditions, no differences were observed

484

in oligomeric stability between wt S and the D614G S mutations, despite the D614G

485

favoring a ‘heads up’ conformation [93, 95, 96] and Vero cells having sufficient levels of

486

endogenous ACE2 to facilitate syncytia formation (Fig. S2c), suggesting that changes in

487

receptor binding do not alter overall protein trimeric association. Notably, in these non-

488

reducing conditions after a 50°C treatment for wt S, the D614G mutant, and wt S+furin,

489

bands between monomer, dimer, and trimer species are observed (Fig. 5b, indicated

490

with *). These intermediate species are not observed after treatment at 100°C. These

491

may represent protein oligomers that are not identically cleaved and are therefore

492

partially destabilized, a phenomenon proposed for MERS-CoV S [32], and murine

493

hepatitis virus CoV S, [102]. Protein oligomers with differential proteolytic processing

494

may also account for the small population of un-cleaved protein we observed at the cell

495

surface in our experiments (Fig. 3e, Fig. 4d, Fig. 5a, and Fig. 6a).

496

Through biochemical and cell biological analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein,

497

we have provided important observations about the stability, proteolytic processing, and

498

requirements for cell-cell fusion of this highly sought-after therapeutic target. This

499

information may be helpful in directing treatments that inhibit S protein fusion, or for

500

discerning methods to stabilize CoV-2 S in therapeutic development. Additional studies

501

are needed to understand the potential interplay between S cleavage sites and how that

502

may contribute to S protein function, as well as to further investigate spike S2 subunit

503

regions that are critical for protein function.

Gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Proteins were separated on a 10% sodium

529

dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). For western blot

530

analysis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane

531

(Fisher Scientific) at 60V for 100 minutes. After blocking with 5% milk in tris-buffered

532

saline + Tween-20 (tTBS) for 1 hour, membranes were incubated with respective

533

antibodies (anti-SARS S 1:5000 dilution, anti-TMPRSS2 1:1000 dilution, anti-hACE2

534

1:1000 dilution) at 4°C overnight. Membranes were then washed with tTBS and

535

incubated with (Li-Cor) secondary antibodies at 1:10000 dilution in 5% milk solution for

536

1 hour. Membranes were washed again with tTBS and diH2O, before being imaged on

537

the Odyssey Image Analyzer (Li-Cor).

538

Syncytia Assay. Cells (Vero or A549s) in 6 well plates were transiently transfected with

539

2μg of either wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 S protein plasmid with Lipofectamine

540

3000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:2:2 DNA: P3000: Lipofectamine 3000. For experiments

541

with the addition of proteases, the total DNA transfected was kept constant at 2μg, in

542

those cases we used 1μg of S and 1μg of the indicated protease. Syncytia formation

543

was imaged at 24 and 48 hours post transfection on a Nikon Ti2 at 20X magnification.

544

Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Effector cells (Vero or A549s) were plated in 12-well

545

plates at 70-90% confluency and transfected with 1μg of total DNA (0.4μg of a T7

546

promoted luciferase plasmid, 0.6μg of wild-type (wt) or mutant S protein or S protein

547

with additional proteases). At the same time BSR cells (constitutively expressing a T7

548

promoter) seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with 2μg either empty pCAGGS or

pcDNA3.1(+)-hACE2. Eighteen to twenty-four hours post transfection BSR cells were

550

lifted using trypsin, centrifuged for five minutes at 1500 rpm, resuspended in normal

551

DMEM+10% FBS, and overlaid onto the S expressing cells at a ratio of 1:1. Overlaid

552

samples were then incubated at 37°C for 9 hours (or as described in the text). Samples

553

were lysed in 100μL of Reporter Gene Lysis buffer (Promega) and frozen overnight.

554

Plates were then scraped on ice, lysates were vortexed for 10 seconds, centrifuged at

555

13,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4°C, and 20μL of the supernatant was added to an opaque

556

96 well plate. Luciferase activity was measured on a SpectraMax iD3 (Molecular

557

Devices) using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Background values were

558

subtracted (empty pCAGGS in BSRs and effector cells) and luciferase activity was

559

expressed as a percentage of wt S (effector cells) and hACE2 (BSR cells).

560

Surface Biotinylation. Two μg of wt or mutant S protein was transfected into Vero or

561

A549 cells using the Lipofectamine 3000 system (Invitrogen; ratios described above).

562

Eighteen to twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were starved in Cys-/Met- media

563

(Gibco) for 45 minutes, and metabolically labelled for six hours using 50μCi of S35

564

(PerkinElmer) incorporated into Cys and Met (S35 Cys/Met). After the label, cells were

565

washed once with PBS (pH 8) and incubated with 1 mg/ml of EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-biotin

566

(Thermo Fisher) in PBS (pH 8) at 4°C for 35 minutes, and then at room temperature for

567

15 minutes. Next the cells were lysed in 500μl of RIPA buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH

568

7.4], 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid) containing 150 mM NaCl,

569

protease inhibitors (1 U aprotinin, 1mM PMSF, [both from Sigma-Aldrich]), 5 mM

572

supernatant was incubated with anti-SARS S polyclonal antibody at 4°C for three hours.

573

Following incubation, Protein A conjugated to Sepharose beads (Cytiva) were added to

574

the samples, and incubated at 4°C for an additional 30 minutes. Post-incubation

575

samples were washed two times with each RIPA Buffer+0.3M NaCl, RIPA Buffer+0.15M

576

NaCl, and SDS-Wash II buffer (50mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150mM NaCl, and 2.5mM

577

EDTA). After buffer aspiration and addition of 10% SDS, samples were boiled for 10

578

minutes. The supernatant was removed to a separate tube. 15μl of supernatant was

579

removed and added to an equal portion of 2X SDS loading buffer and labeled “TOTAL”.

580

Biotinylation buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8], 150mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and

581

0.2% BSA) and Streptavidin conjugated beads were added to the remaining

582

supernatant, and this was incubated at 4°C for one hour. Samples were again washed

583

as described above and 2X SDS loading buffer was added following the washes.

584

Samples were boiled for 15 minutes and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were dried

585

and exposed on a phosphoscreen for two to four days, then visualized using a Typhoon

586

Imaging System (GE Healthcare). Bands were quantified using band densitometry

587

using the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).

Eighteen to twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were starved in Cys-/Met- media

591

(Gibco) for 45 minutes, and metabolically label for one hour using 50μCi of S35 Cys/Met.

592

After the one-hour label, cells were washed once with PBS and normal DMEM + 10%

593

FBS was added for indicated times. Cells were then lysed in 500μl of RIPA lysis buffer.

594

Anti-SARS S polyclonal antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the CoV-2 S protein

603

50μCi of S35 Cys/Met. Lysed cells were immunoprecipitated as described above,

604

however after the washing steps, 30μl of 2X SDS loading buffer without dithiothreitol

605

(DTT) was added to each sample. Samples were treated at 50°C or 100°C, as

606

indicated, for 20 minutes and analyzed on a 3.5% acrylamide gel under non-reducing

607

conditions. The gel was dried, exposed, and imaged as described for surface
