Abstract

COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While the pathophysiology of this
deadly virus is complex and largely unknown, we employ a network biology-fueled
approach and integrated multiomics data pertaining to lung epithelial cells-specific coexpression network and human interactome to generate Calu-3-specific human-SARSCoV-2 Interactome (CSI). Topological clustering and pathway enrichment analysis show
that SARS-CoV-2 target central nodes of host-viral network that participate in core
functional pathways. Network centrality analyses discover 28 high-value SARS-CoV-2
targets, which are possibly involved in viral entry, proliferation and survival to establish
infection and facilitate disease progression. Our probabilistic modeling framework
elucidates critical regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to COVID-19,
particularly the host modifying responses and cytokine storm. Overall, our network
centric analyses reveal novel molecular components, uncover structural and functional
modules, and provide molecular insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.

Introduction
From the epicenter of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak in China, the
disease has spread globally in 185 countries/territories with over 1.4 million confirmed
cases and almost 87,000 fatalities as of April 07, 2020, and the World Health
Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic is accelerating worldwide 1, 2. Apart from
the human tragedy, COVID-19 has a growing detrimental impact on the global economy

and will likely cause trillions in financial losses worldwide in 2020 alone. COVID-19 is an
infectious respiratory illness caused by a highly contagious and pathogenic SARS-CoV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This single-stranded RNA virus
belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is closely related to another human coronavirus
SARS-CoV with 89.1% nucleotide similarity

2, 3

. SARS-CoV and another human

coronavirus MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV) caused two previous
global epidemics in 2003 and 2012, respectively, both characterized by high fatality
rates

2, 3

. These coronaviruses mainly spread from a contagious individual to a healthy

person through respiratory droplets derived from an infected person’s cough or sneeze,
and from direct contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, where the virus can
maintain its viability for period ranging from hours to days

2,

3

. Unlike other

coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 transmits more efficiently and sustainably in the
community according to Center for Disease Control (CDC) 4. While majority of the
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild to moderate self-resolving
respiratory illness, infants and older adults (≥ 65 years) as well as patients with preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
respiratory disease, renal dysfunction, obesity and cancer are more vulnerable

2, 3

. The

pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 is complex and largely unknown but is associated with
an extensive immune reaction referred to as ‘cytokine storm’ triggered by the excessive
production of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and others. The cytokine
release syndrome leads to extensive tissue damage and multiple organ failure 2. While
no vaccine or antiviral drugs are currently available to prevent or treat COVID-19,
identifying molecular targets of the virus could help uncover effective treatment.

Towards this, generation of a human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome, integration of virusrelated transcriptome to interactome, discovery of disease-related structural and
functional modules, and dynamic transcriptional modeling will provide insights into the
virulent mechanisms of this deadly virus.

Networks encompass a set of nodes and edges, also referred as vertices and links,
respectively. Nodes are systems components, whereas edges represent the
interactions or relationships among the nodes

5, 6

. In biological systems, genes and their

products perform their functions by interacting with other molecular components within
the cell. For instance, proteins directly or indirectly interact with each other under both
steady-state and different stress conditions to form static and dynamic complexes, and
participate in diverse signaling cascades, distinct cellular pathways and a wide
spectrum of biological processes. Proteome scale maps of such protein-protein
interactions are referred to as interactomes

5, 6

. Meanwhile, specialized pathogens

including viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes employ a suite of pathogenic or virulent
proteins, which interact with high value targets in host interactomes to extensively
rewire the flow of information and cause disease

5, 7, 8, 9

. Therefore, analyzing the

network architecture and deciphering the structural properties of host-pathogens
interactomes may reveal novel components in virus pathogenicity. Such analysis
indicates that diverse cellular networks are governed by universal laws and exhibit
scale-free network topology, whose degree distribution follows a power law distribution
with a few nodes harboring increased connectivity 5. Given that diverse biological
systems display similar network architecture and topology, several structural features

and physical characteristics within a cellular network may act as indicators of important
nodes 5. These include degree (the number of edges of a node), and betweenness (the
fraction of the shortest paths that include a node) 6, 10, 11. Indeed, it has been shown that
hubs (high degree nodes) and high betweenness nodes (bottlenecks) are targets of
numerous human–viral, human–bacterial and other human diseases 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

. In addition, host protein targets of diverse pathogens were demonstrated

to be in close proximity (shortest path) with differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

23

.

Specific to viral-host pathosystem, the network analysis of several interactomes
including human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus,
influenza virus and human papillomavirus indicate that several of the above described
topological features are associated with viral targets 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
Recently, in SARS-CoV human interactome, nodes corresponding to hubs and
bottlenecks including respiratory chain complex I proteins were identified as targets of
SARS-CoV. This system-wide analysis also identified several immunophilins as direct
physical interacting partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1)

12

. Importantly,

using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), a proteome-scale mapping
recently identified 332 SARS-CoV-2 Interacting Proteins (SIPs) in human

29

. This

groundbreaking study paved new avenues to investigate novel therapeutic targets using
a systems pharmacology approach. Undoubtedly, network biology presents a nextgeneration, integrative approach for drug repurposing that can predict individual or,
more likely, combinatorial sets of drugs with high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 30, 31.
Here, we generated a comprehensive human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome encompassing
12,852 nodes and 84,100 edges. We also performed a weighted co-expression network

analysis (WGCNA) in Cultured Human Airway Epithelial Cells (Calu-3) treated with
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV over time (22, 445 nodes, 10,649,854 edges). By integrating
co-expression network with interactome, we obtained Calu-3-specific human – SARSCoV-2 Interactome (CSI) containing 4,123 nodes and 14,650 edges. Network analysis
indicates that the average degree, betweenness and information centrality of SIPs are
enriched in CSI. Module-based functional pathway analyses discovered several
disease-related clusters that are enriched in several signaling pathways and biological
processes including eIF2 signaling/translation, inhibition of ARE-mediated mRNA
degradation pathway, protein ubiquitination pathway, T cell receptor regulation of
apoptosis, NER pathway, RNA degradation and retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis
signaling pathway. Network topology analyses identified 28 high-value targets of SARSCoV-2, which can form complexes with other highly influential nodes within CSI. These
most important nodes are possibly involved in the viral entry, proliferation and survival in
the host tissue as well as required to induce a conducive environment for viral
sustenance and pathogenesis. Moreover, we incorporated transcriptome data of
COVID-19 patients derived from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with our CSI data. Subsequently, we performed
dynamic gene regulation modeling on the CSI nodes to decipher the intricate
relationships between important transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of particular of interest is the TF-regulatory relationships
involved in host modifying processes such as protein translation, ubiquitination, and the
cytokine storm. In summary, our integrative network topology analyses led us elucidate
the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Results

Integrated interactome-transcriptome analysis to generate Calu-3-specific humanSARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI)

It is likely that the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection can largely be determined by the
interaction patterns of host proteins and viral factors. To build the human – SARS-CoV2 interactome, we first assembled a comprehensive human interactome encompassing
experimentally validated PPIs from STRING database

32

. Since the STRING database

is not fully updated, we manually curated PPIs from four additional proteomes-scale
interactome studies, i.e. Human Interactome I and II, BioPlex, QUBIC, and CoFrac
(reviewed in

33

). This yielded us an experimentally validated high quality interactome

containing 18,906 nodes and 444,633 edges (Fig. 1a). Subsequently, we compiled an
exhaustive list of 394 host proteins interacting with the novel human coronavirus that
was referred to as SARS-CoV-2 Interacting Proteins (SIPs) (Supplementary Data 1).
This comprises 332 human proteins associated with the peptides of SARS-CoV-2

29

,

whereas the remaining 62 host proteins interact with the viral factors of other human
coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

34

, which could also be of

significance in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. By querying
these 394 SIPs in the human interactome, we generated a subnetwork of 12,852 nodes
and 84,100 edges that covers first and second neighbors of 373 SIPs (Fig. 1a). Given
that the SIPs-derived PPI subnetwork may not operate in all spatial or temporal

conditions, coronavirus-specific co-expression data is used to filter the interactions in
the context of COVID-19. It is important to note that no exceptionally high-resolution
SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome was available at the time of analysis (details below).
Therefore, we took advantage of extensive temporal expression data available for
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1b). Towards this, we performed a weighted coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) in Human Airway Epithelial Cells (Calu-3)
treated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV over time in vitro in culture. This analysis
yielded a comprehensive co-expression network with 22,445 nodes and 10,649,854
edges (Fig. 1b). By integrating this Calu-3 co-expression network with SIPs-derived PPI
subnetwork, we generated Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI) that
contains 214 SIPs interacting with their first and second neighbors make a network of
4,123 nodes and 14,650 edges (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 1). We showed that CSI
follows a power law degree distribution with a few nodes harboring increased
connectivity, and thus exhibits properties of a scale-free network (r2 = 0.91; (Fig. 1d,
Supplementary Data 1), similar to the previously generated other human-viral
interactomes

12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

. Taken together, we constructed a

robust, high quality CSI that was further utilized for network-aided architectural and
functional pathway analyses.

Network topology and module-based functional analyses reveal that SARS-CoV-2
targets core signaling pathways of the host network

From a network biology standpoint, a viral infection as well as other pathogen attacks
can be viewed as a set of strategic perturbations, at least in part, within the core
components of the host interactome

24, 25, 26

. Since such central nodes correspond to

proteins that exhibit increased connectivity and/or central positions within a network, we
addressed a question whether SARS-CoV-2 also attacks such important nodes within
CSI. Towards this, we calculated the average degree (number of connections),
betweenness (the fraction of all shortest paths that include a node within a network),
load centrality (the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through a node), information
centrality (the harmonic mean of all the information measures for a node in a connected
network) and PageRank index (counting incoming and outgoing connections
considering the weight of the edge) for SIPs, and compared them with their first and
second neighbors. We demonstrated that these four topological features of SIPs were
significantly higher than the other nodes within CSI (Fig. 2a, b, c and Supplementary
Fig. 1a and b, Supplementary Data 2; t- test P < 0.0001). We also showed that SIPs
were significantly enriched in CSI compared to the human interactome (Fig. 2d,
Supplementary Data 2; hypergeometric P< 3.159E-51). These results indicate that
SARS-CoV-2 targets core structural components of the human-viral interactome, and
prompted another question as to whether CSI also activates common biological
processes in response to viral infection. Since nodes within CSI not only form protein
complexes with each other but also transcriptionally co-express, we reasoned that
densely connected nodes within this network may participate in similar biological
functions. Towards this, we investigated the underlying modular structures (protein
clusters ≥ 5 nodes) in CSI followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). This approach

allowed us to identify 27 modules ranging from 5 to 66 nodes for the smallest and
largest modules, respectively. Subsequently, we examined the biological processes,
cellular pathways and signaling cascades that are modulated in the top 10 modules
(Fig. 2e-k, Supplementary Data 2). Significantly enriched signaling pathways and
biological processes included eIF2 signaling/translation representing protein translation
control, inhibition of ARE-mediated mRNA degradation pathway, protein ubiquitination
pathway, T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, NER pathway, RNA degradation and
retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway (-log(P-value) ≥2; Fig. 2 e-k,
Supplementary Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 2). Enrichment analysis of KEGG
pathways can be utilized to ascertain signal transduction, as well as biochemical and
metabolic pathways. The significantly enriched pathways (P-value ≤0.05) mainly
included the infection with a number of viruses, oxidative phosphorylation, ER protein
processing and apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 1d, Supplementary Data 2). Finally, we
performed

a

analysis

that

phenotypic

abnormalities encountered in human diseases. Significantly enriched terms included
mitochondrial inheritance, hepatic necrosis, respiratory failure and abnormality of the
common coagulation pathway (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Collectively, we showed that
SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with central nodes of CSI, and these proteins are
implicated in core molecular and cellular pathways to establish infection and continue
disease progress.

Network topology framework identifies most influential nodes in CSI

Human-viral interactome landscapes of several viruses have previously shown that viral
proteins interact with nodes corresponding to high degree (hubs) and high betweenness
(bottlenecks), and such structural features have been previously used to predict viral
targets

12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

. In addition to hubs and bottlenecks,

PageRank algorithm was also effectively used to identify viral targets

27

. Moreover,

these physical characteristics can also be used to prioritize the most influential genes in
CSI for biological relevance and drug target discovery. Here, we used nine different
centrality indices to identify the most influential nodes referred to as CSI Significant
Proteins (CSPs). This includes the above described degree, betweenness, information
centrality, PageRank index and load centrality as well as additional features such as
eigenvector centrality (a measure of the influence of a node in a network), closeness
centrality (reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node
and network), harmonic centrality (reverses the sum and reciprocal operations of
closeness centrality and weighted k-shell decomposition) (an edge weighting method
based on adding the degree of two nodes in network partition). While weighted k-shell
decomposition analysis was recently performed to increase the predictability of host
targets of bacterial pathogens

35

, we showed that the top 5% of nodes reside in the

inner layers of CSI (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 2). For other centrality measures, we
also maintained a stringent threshold of top 5% to be considered as a highly influential
node or CSP. Evidently, we can expect overlapping topological features for the same
set of nodes. Noticeably, we observed a strong positive correlation between information
centrality and degree (Fig. 3b; r2 = 0.9), betweenness and degree (Fig. 3c; r2 = 0.51)
and PageRank and degree (Fig. 3d; r2 = 0.84, Supplementary Data 2).

Collectively, we identified 28 CSPs that exhibit more than one high centrality measure
(Fig. 3e, Supplementary Data 3). For instance, EEF1A1 that has previously been
implicated in SARS was enriched in all the centrality measures tested in our study (Fig.
3f, Supplementary Data 3). In addition, UBE2I, PPIA, and PHB were also associated
with SARS and were enriched in more than five centrality measures (Fig. 3f,
Supplementary Data 3). We categorized these 28 CSPs into three major groups based
on their potential roles in COVID-19. While we expect some, if not all, of these proteins
to have more than one function, the group-1 CSPs might be largely relevant to
modifying host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3e). Moreover, the
proteins in the other two groups might be involved in viral entry, proliferation, survival
and pathogenesis as well as cytokine storm (Fig. 3e; see details in discussion).
Furthermore, we found that these 28 CSPs are targets of some of the well-known
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 targets most of the CSPs (i.e. seven in
total), SARS-CoV2 nsp8 targets five CSPs, and SARS-CoV-2 M has four CSPs targets,
while other SARS-CoV-2 nsps’ (2,4,10) and SARS-CoV-2 orfs’ (3b, 6,8,9c) possess
relatively fewer targets. Intriguingly, three of our CSPs (PPIA, RPS20, and NDUFA10)
are targets of more than one SARS-CoV2 protein (Fig 3g, Supplementary Fig. 2), while
PHB is the target of several viral proteins tested as bait at low threshold. It is also
important to note that PHB is also targeted by viral proteins of SARS-CoV

34

. These

data support previous findings that an individual viral factor can target multiple host
nodes and several viral proteins can interact with the same host protein

12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

. Collectively, these data strengthen our notion that centrality

measures can be an effective method to predict highly influential nodes, leading us to
discover 28 such CSPs.

Dynamic gene regulation modeling elucidates core transcriptional circuitry and
regulatory signatures pertinent to SARS-CoV-2 infection

To further understand the biological characteristics, regulatory relationships and
molecular events associated with the nodes in CSI, we incorporated transcriptome data
of COVID-19 patients derived from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with our CSI data

36

. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection

exhibited largely different transcriptional signatures for BALF and PBMC

36

. We

identified a set of 228 and 215 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BALF and
PBMC, respectively (p≤ 0.05, FC ≥2.0, Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Data 4). Thus, CSI
constitutes over 25% of transcriptomes pertaining to both BALF and PBMC. Intriguingly,
in BALF, we observed that the upregulated cluster A is enriched with eIF2
signaling/translation pathway, while the two down-regulated clusters (B and C) are
enriched in retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway (Fig. 4a). Conversely,
one major cluster that is significantly upregulated in PBMC is enriched in T cell receptor
regulation of apoptosis and protein ubiquitination pathway (Fig. 4b). These data further
support the notion that significantly enriched protein modules in CSI are involved in
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

To reveal the regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to SARS-CoV-2
infection, we performed probabilistic modeling using iDREM (interactive Dynamic
Regulatory Events Miner) framework that incorporates protein-DNA interaction data with
transcriptomics

37

. Given that iDREM requires time-course transcriptional profiling data,

and in vivo or in vitro temporal SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data is currently lacking, we
made use of a high-resolution temporal SARS-CoV dataset (11 time points)

38

.

However, we only focused on those upstream transcriptional factors (TFs) and
downstream target genes that were also present in BALF and PBMC, which allowed us
to mimic SARS-CoV-2-mediated dynamic regulatory networks. This dynamic regulatory
modeling identified several bifurcation points, where a set of TFs regulates their
potential co-expressed and downstream target genes (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 3,
Supplementary Data 4). Based on the expression trajectories and path expression
patterns, we identified a total of 84 and 94 significant regulators that were expressed in
BALF and PBMC COVID-19 patients’ samples, respectively (P< 0.05, Supplementary
Data 4). Among them, we observed the first major wave of differential regulation and
activation of TFs at 12-hour post infection. At this bifurcation transcriptional event, we
found a set of 4 TFs (YY1, STAT1, STAT2, and SREBF2), which were also expressed
in BALF transcriptome. The next major bifurcation occurred at 24-hour post infection,
comprising 39 and 43 TFs expressed in BALF and PBMC, respectively (Supplementary
Data 4). While we found similar sets of target genes regulated by diverse sets of TFs at
different stages of infection, we also discovered multiple combinations of TFs regulating
similar sets of downstream genes (Fig. 4c). This reflects the intricate nature of dynamic
regulatory relationships between TFs and their targets.

Next, we primarily focused on four major pathways/signaling events, i.e. cytokine storm,
eIF2 signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway and T cell receptor regulation
of apoptosis. In the first example of cytokine storm, we identified a total of 10 TFs
(STAT2, SUZ12, JUN, STAT1, MEF2A, RAD21, STAT3, BCL11A, NFE2, and BATF)
expressed in BALF and PBMC COVID-19 patients’ samples (Supplementary Data 4).
Predominantly, we found that two TFs (STAT1 and STAT2) and one master regulator
(JUN) are early transcriptional players activated at 12- and 24-hour post infection. In
particular, we found CSI genes CXCL1 and TNFAIP3 co-regulated with CXCL2 and
CXCL3, and IL-1A and IL-6, respectively, indicating that members of CSI participate in
cytokine storm. Majority of these TFs are related to inflammatory/immune regulatory
processes.

Similarly, during eIF2 signaling/translation, we identified a total of 14 TFs (MXI1,
BRCA1, ELF1, SIN3A, E2F4, IRF1, GABPB1, HMGN3, ETS1, SP2, POLR2A, ELK4,
CHD2, and CCNT2) expressed in BALF and PBMC (Supplementary Fig. 3,
Supplementary Data 4). This set of proteins is involved in the dynamic regulation of
eIF2 signaling/translation-related genes over the course of time. Predominantly, we
found that 12 master regulators (CHD2, SIN3A, ETS1, MXI1, CCNT2, E2F4, ELK4,
IRF1, GABPB1, ELF1, POLR2A, and HMGN3) of eIF2 signaling/translation are involved
in dynamic transcriptional regulation at 24-hour post infection. Interestingly, we revealed
that 12 TFs also regulated 9 CSPs (AP2M1, NDUFA10, PHB, PPIA, PPP1CA, RPS20,
RTN4, SCCPDH, and UBE2I) along with eIF2 signaling/translation-related genes.

Correspondingly, during protein ubiquitination, we identified a total of nine TFs (IRF1,
CCNT2, BRCA1, MXI1, CHD2, POLR2A, SIN3A, E2F4, and HEY1) expressed in BALF
and PBMC (Supplementary Data 4). Interestingly, in the gene subset related to T cell
receptor regulation of apoptosis, we identified a total of 11 TFs (E2F4, ELF1, CCNT2,
ETS1, ELK4, HMGN3, SP2, IRF1, GABPB1, MXI1, and SIN3A) expressed in BALF and
PBMC that participate in the regulation of this pathway genes including members of
CSPs (Supplementary Data 4). Overall, we demonstrated the dynamic transcription
patterns of CSI genes and CSPs that participate in cytokine storm, eIF2
signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway and T cell receptor regulation of
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 4). Finally, we identified a set of
TFs that potentially regulate the above mentioned pathways’ genes at various stages of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients.

Discussion
In the last two decades, intra- and inter-species interactomes have been generated in a
number of prokaryotes and eukaryotes including human, mouse, worm and plant
models

5, 6, 10, 33

. Investigating such interactomes has indicated that diverse cellular

networks are governed by universal laws, and led to the discovery of shared and distinct
molecular components and signaling pathways implicated in viral pathogenicity. In the
present study, we constructed a Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI)
by integrating the lung epithelial cells-specific co-expression network with the human
interactome. We determined that CSI displayed features of scale-freeness and was
enriched in different centrality measures. Identification of structural modules displayed

the relationships with a set of functional pathways in CSI. In-depth network analyses
revealed 28 most influential nodes. Additional noteworthy findings pertain to SARSCoV-2 transcriptional signatures, regulatory relationships among diverse pathways in
CSI and overall SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis including the cytokine storm.

We constructed a comprehensive and robust CSI, a human-viral interactome that
displayed scale free properties (r2= 0.91; Fig. 1d). We also showed that the SARS-CoV2 interacting proteins (SIPs) exhibit increased average centrality indices compared to
the remaining proteins in the network (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Numerous
human-viral interactomes have previously been generated to uncover global principles
of viral entry, infection and disease progression. These include human T-cell
lymphotropic viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, human
papillomavirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, HIV-1, and SARS-CoV 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28

, and all of these interactomes exhibited a power law distribution. Another

significant tenet of interactomes is the existence of modular structures or modules,
defined as sets of densely connected clusters within a network that exhibit heightened
connectivity among nodes within a module. Such nodes within a module have
previously been deemed to possess similar biological function or belong to the same
functional pathways

39

. Since nodes in CSI not only form protein complexes but also co-

express specifically to coronavirus infection, we extracted several functional modules
from our network (Fig. 2 e-k). The mostly highly connected module pertains to eIF2
signaling, and is comprised of protein translation-related proteins such as RPS and
RPLs. Indeed, these ribosomal proteins have been shown to interact with viral RNA for

17

viral proteins biosynthesis, and are subsequently required for viral replication in the host
cells

40

. Noteworthy, two ribosomal proteins, RPL36 and RPS20, found to interact with

several SARS-CoV-2 viral factors. Moreover, both of these proteins are also CSI
Significant Proteins (CSPs) that harbor increased centrality measures (Fig. 3e).
Intriguingly, RPS20 has been demonstrated to operate as an immune factor that
activates TLR3-mediated antiviral. It remains to be addressed whether RPS20 is a
“double whammy” target of SARS-CoV-2 for (1) hijacking this important factor for viral
translation and replication, and (2) suppressing a critical immune signaling pathway.
Regardless, ribosomal proteins are critical targets of numerous viruses and play equally
essential roles in developing antiviral therapeutics 40.
The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the major protein degradation
system of eukaryotic cells that participate in a wide range of cellular processes, and
another critical target of diverse viruses

41

. UPS plays an indispensable role in fine-

tuning the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, proteasome-mediated
activation of NF-κB regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8. Similarly, UPS is indispensable in the regulation of leukocyte
proliferation

41

. The UPS is generally considered a double-edged sword in viral

pathogenesis. For example, UPS is a powerhouse that eliminates viral proteins to
control viral infection, but at the same time viruses hijack UPS machinery for their
propagation 41. In case of herpes simplex virus type 1, Varicella-zoster virus and Simian
varicella virus, induction of NF-κB – mediated host innate immunity is suppressed by the
manipulation of UPS components

42

. Moreover, it was revealed that UPS plays crucial

roles at multiple stages of coronaviruses’ infection

43

. In our study, the ubiquitin

proteasome module was composed of several members of 26S proteasome ATPase or
non-ATPase regulatory subunits, which includes two CSPs, PSMD8 and PSMA2 (Fig.
3e). It still needs to be determined whether these two CSPs play important roles in the
expression of proinflammatory cytokines and are potentially involved in the cytokine
storm. While the mechanistic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with these two highvalue targets needs to be explored, both the mRNA and protein expression
corresponding to PSMD8 was recently shown to be decreased up to 30% in aged
keratinocytes

44

. Since reduced proteasome activity results in aggregation of aberrant

proteins that perturb cellular functions, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 targets these
CSPs to interfere with ER-mediated cellular responses. Another noteworthy module is
the T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis. Indeed, it was recently reported that SARSCoV-2 infection may cause lymphocyte apoptosis demonstrated by overall cell count
and transcriptional signatures in PBMC of COVID-19 patients

36, 45

. Another significant

CSP in this pathway is MTCH1 (Fig. 3e), a proapoptotic protein that triggers apoptosis
independent of BAX and BAK

46

. We hypothesized that cytokines-mediated induction of

cytokine storm is partially dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with MTCH1.
Taken together, our module-based functional analyses identified several novel
molecular components, structural and functional modules, and overall provided insights
into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.
Our network topology analyses discovered 28 CSI Significant Proteins (CSPs) that have
been implicated in several above described modules and pathways (Fig. 3e). To provide
a system-wide perspective of the importance of these CSPs in COVID-19, we
categorized these CSPs into three groups based on their possible functionality. Group-1

includes CSPs that are potentially relevant to modifying host response following SARSCoV-2 infection. These include EEF1A1, ETFA, MRPS27, MRPS5, MTCH1, NDUFA10,
RAB1A, RAB2A, RAB5C, RAB7A and RHOA (Fig. 3e). We hypothesized that such
CSPs are important in creating protective environment in host tissue following the viral
infection. For example, RAB and RHO group of ras proteins may be involved in
augmenting

inflammatory

signaling

pathways.

While

antioxidants

regulating

mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins are possibly important in regulating and
maintaining redox homeostasis

47

, another CSP, SCCPDH, is involved in the metabolic

production of lysine (Lys) and α-ketoglutarate (α-kg)

48

. Intriguingly, L-lysine

supplementation appears to be ineffective for prophylaxis or treatment of herpes
49

. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may target SCCPDH to hijack

simplex lesions

the biosynthesis of this essential amino acid for its benefit. Group-2 CSPs that we
identified are likely to be hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 for its entry, proliferation and survival
in the host tissue. In this category, one of the most important CSPs is prohibitin (PHB;
Fig. 3e). PHB is an important protein shown to be a receptor for dengue and
Chikungunya viruses

50, 51

. Although it has been shown that ACE2 serves as the main

receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells

52

, it is quite interesting that pathogenesis

of the viral infection is not significantly different between the populations of hypertensive
patients who receive or don’t receive ACE2 inhibitors 53, 54, 55, 56. Therefore, it is plausible
that under certain physiological conditions when SARS-CoV-2 does not engage with the
ACE2 receptor for its entry into the cell, PHB serves as an alternative receptor. Another
CSP Integrin β1 encoded by ITGB1 was recently shown to be required for the entry of
Rabies Virus

57

. Whether ITGB1 could also promote the entry of SARS-CoV-2 is

20

another question that needs to be addressed. MEPCE is another important enzyme
involved in RNA stabilization by capping the 5´ end of RNA with methyl phosphate

58

. It

is also likely that MEPCE is utilized by the COVID-19 virus for stabilization of its RNA in
the host tissue. Similarly, PPP1CA was shown to regulate HIV-1 transcription by
modulating CDK9 phosphorylation

59

, and thus is potentially involved in the gene

regulation of SARS-CoV-2. As discussed above, PSMA2 and PSMD8 are the two
proteasomal CSPs

42, 43, 44

. While infecting the lung epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 may utilize

these UPS proteins for the fusion with the host cell membrane (Fig. 3e). Similarly,
NUP98 can also be utilized for viral entry into the nucleus. Additional three CSPs in this
category, RPL36 and RPS20

40, 60

as well as SRP72

61

, could be employed for viral

transcription and protein synthesis (Fig. 3e). Finally, Group-3 CSPs are proteins, which
SARS-CoV-2 may utilize both to facilitate its proliferation as well as to induce a
conducive environment in the host tissue for its sustenance and pathogenesis (Fig. 3e).
These CSPs include AP2M1, CSNK2B, EEF1A1, ETFA, LARP1, RTN4 and UBE2I.
Among these CSPs, EEF1A1, PPIA, PSMA2, PSMD8, RAB1A, RAB2A, RAB5C,
RAB7A, RHOA and UBE2I are identified as the ones that are potentially associated with
the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm as observed in some severely affected patient
populations. Intriguingly, EEF1A1, a target of several viruses, is known to be activated
upon inflammation

62

. This CSP is independently identified as one of the major

regulators in human-SARS-CoV-2 predicted interactome

63

. The CSPs, which regulate

protein folding and translation, for example EIAF1, could be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to
halt host protein translation, folding and protein quality control. In addition, we also
identified E2F4, TBX3 and SMARCB as first neighbors of some of these CSPs. These

21

CSPs complexes play key roles in promoting cell death, causing inflammation and
acting enzymatically as viral integrases. Collectively, these CSPs and their first
neighbors could directly and indirectly perform intricate pathopysiological functions but
those mentioned here could be the key effects of COVID-19 on host tissue
dysregulation. This classification is also crucial for the design of effective therapeutic
interventions against COVID-19. Finally, we presented transcriptional modeling of CSI
genes including CSPs that participate in cytokine storm, eIF2 signaling/translation,
protein ubiquitination pathway and T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis. Thus, these
signaling pathways and TFs discovered through our analyses could provide important
clues about effective drug targets and their combinations that can be administered at
different stages of COVID-19.
In conclusion, we generated a human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome, integrated virusrelated transcriptome to interactome, discover COVID-19 pertinent structural and
functional modules, identify high-value viral targets, and perform dynamic transcriptional
modeling. Thus, our integrative network biology-based framework led us uncover the
underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Materials and methods

Human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome data acquisition
To build human interactome, we assembled a comprehensive protein-protein

. The resulted human interactome have

18,906 nodes (proteins) with 444,633 edges (interactions). Our human interactome
have 1,200 more proteins and 93,189 interactions which was not included in previous
study

37

. We collected a total of 394 SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins (SIPs) from two

recent studies encompassing 332 proteins of SARS-CoV-2-human interactions

32

, and

62 proteins of SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV- human interactions 37 (Supplementary Data

Differential gene expression analysis on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
datasets
We obtained microarray data for GSE33267, GSE37827, GSE56677 from GEO
database

64

and used GEO2R, an interactive web tool to generate differential gene

expression between infection and mock treatments at their respective time points.
Briefly, GEO2R utilizes limma R package. Limma is an R package for the analysis of
gene expression microarray data. Specifically, it uses the linear model for analyzing
designed experiments and the assessment of differential expression. A threshold of 2
log fold change and FDR ≤ 0.05 was set for differential expression analysis of all
microarray experiments. For comparative study of SARS-CoV-2 expression pattern, we
downloaded expression data set of RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of COVID-19 patients

We mined Calu-3 Cells-specific datasets from GEO database

64

, and downloaded

GSE33267 (Wild type), GSE37827 (icSARSCoV) and GSE56677(LoCov). We
performed

individual weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)

65

package (R version 3.6.1), and constructed three co-expression networks. Moreover,
we also generated topological overlap measure (TOM) plots to compute a numerical
entity that reflects interconnectedness among genes within a co-expression network. A
cut-off of 0.75 was used to export the networks.

Subsequently, we merged these

networks to generate a comprehensive Calu-3 cells-specific co-expression to study the
network connectivity pattern of interactome.
Network Integration and Topology Analysis
To extract the Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI) we integrated the
merged transcriptomics co-expression network (22, 445 nodes with 10,649,854 edges)
and SARS-CoV-2–Human Interactions (12,852 nodes with 84,100 edges) including 373
SIPs. The resulted CSI network has 4,123 nodes with 14,650 edges including 214 SIPs
with all possible interactions including their first and second neighbors (Supplementary
Data 1). Network topology analyses was performed using NetworkX

(version 2.4)

Python (version 3.7.6) package was used except weighted k-shell-decomposition for
which we downloaded wk-shell-decomposition Cystoscope App (version 1.0).
Cytoscape (Version 7.3.2) was used to visualize all the networks.

Reconstructing SARS-CoV Responsive Dynamic Regulatory Events
Interactive visualization of dynamic regulatory networks (iDREM) is a method which
incorporates static and time series expression data to reconstruct condition-specific
reaction network in an unsupervised manner

28

. Additionally, the regulatory model

identifies specific stimulated pathways and genes, which uses statistical analysis to
recognize TFs that vary in activity among models. We implemented iDREM on 4,952
cumulative differentially expressed genes across 72 hours of SARS-CoV infection with
log2 normalization for dynamic regulatory event mining with all human 954,377
TFs/targets collections from encode database

68

. The dynamic activated pathways

regulated by TFs was generated by EBI human gene ontology function.
Statistical analyses
Hypergeometric test, linear regression (r2), and Student t-test were performed using R
version 3.3.1 as well as online Stat Trek tool.
