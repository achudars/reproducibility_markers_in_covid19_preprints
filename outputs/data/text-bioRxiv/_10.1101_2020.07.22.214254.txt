Abstract

Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is posing a major threat to human health and its diffusion around the
world is having dire socioeconomical consequences. Thanks to the scientific community’s
unprecedented efforts, the atomic structure of several viral proteins has been promptly resolved. As
the crucial mediator of host cell infection, the heavily glycosylated trimeric viral Spike protein (S) has
been attracting the most attention and is at the center of efforts to develop antivirals, vaccines, and
diagnostic solutions.
Herein, we use an energy-decomposition approach to identify antigenic domains and antibody
binding sites on the fully glycosylated S protein. Crucially, all that is required by our method are
unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad
hoc combinations of parameters/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply
exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and
monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous
residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein.
Our results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex
with anti- or nanobodies. We identify poorly coupled sub-domains: on the one hand this indicates
their role in hosting (several) epitopes, and on the other hand indicates their involvement in large
functional conformational transitions. Finally, we detect two distinct behaviors of the glycan shield:
glycans with stronger energetic coupling are structurally relevant and protect underlying peptidic
epitopes; those with weaker coupling could themselves be poised for antibody recognition. Predicted
Immunoreactive regions can be used to develop optimized antigens (recombinant subdomains,
synthetic (glyco)peptidomimetics) for therapeutic applications.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has
infected millions of people worldwide, causing more than 500000 deaths (as of June 30th, 2020) and
extensive social and economic disruption. Given the pandemic status of the outbreak, social
distancing measures cannot be sufficient any longer in containing it on a worldwide scale. This
emergency calls for the development of strategies to rapidly identify pharmacological agents or
vaccines as the only way to contain and combat the disease, restoring normal social conditions.
Indeed, a number of currently ongoing trials focus on developing vaccines (see for instance
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)

or

on

repurposing drugs already developed for other disorders 1-4.
SARS-CoV-2 is extraordinarily effective in exploiting the host’s protein machinery for replication and
spreading. This is a characteristic that it shares with other members of the Coronaviridae family, all
of which are characterized by a highly selective tropism that determines the onset of a variety of
diseases in domestic and wild animals as well as in humans, including central nervous system
affections, hepatitis and respiratory syndromes

5-6

. As was the case with its human predecessors

SARS-CoV and MERS, critical players regulating cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 are the homotrimeric viral
Spike protein (S) (Figure 1) and the host cell docking point, the protein receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)7. The CoV S protein is then cleaved by a series of serine proteases,
including trypsin, cathepsins, elastase, the host type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2,
DPP4 for MERS), and plasmin, which promote virus entry into epithelial cells 4.
Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses allowed to precisely determine the structure of
the full-length Spike protein in its trimeric form 8-10, and the structural basis for the recognition of the
Spike protein’s Receptor Binding Domain (RBD; Figure 1) by the extracellular peptidase domain of
ACE2 11. In parallel, computational studies have started to provide atomically detailed insights into S
protein dynamics and on the elaborate role of the diverse polysaccharide chains that decorate its
surface, effectively shielding a large portion of it from the host 12-14.
This detailed dynamic and structural knowledge can set the stage for understanding the molecular
bases of S protein recognition by the host’s immune system, providing information on which physicochemical determinants are required to elicit functional antibodies. Such understanding can then be
exploited to design and engineer improved antigens based on S, for instance by identifying antigenic

domains that can be expressed in isolation or short sequences (epitopes) that can be mimicked by
synthetic peptides15-20: this would be a crucial first step in the selection and optimization of candidate
vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, as well as in the development of serological diagnostic tools.
Furthermore, knowledge acquired today about such recognition mechanisms could well mean that
we are better prepared to tackle similar pandemics in the future by contrasting them more efficiently
with the application of efficient and well-tested methods to new protein variants.
Here, we analyze representative 3D conformations of the full-length trimeric S protein in its fully
glycosylated form (Figure 1), extracted from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided
by the Woods group 13, in order to predict immunogenic regions.

To this end, a simple ab initio epitope prediction method that we previously developed for
unmodified proteins 21-23 is optimized and extended to cover glycoproteins. The method is based on
the idea that antibody-recognition sites (epitopes) may correspond to localized regions only
exhibiting low-intensity energetic coupling with the rest of the structure; this lower degree of
coupling would allow them to undergo conformational changes more easily, to be recognized by a
binding partner, and to tolerate mutations at minimal energetic expense.
We show that our approach is indeed able to identify regions—also comprising carbohydrates—that
recent structural immunology studies have shown to be effectively targeted by antibodies. On the
same basis, our method predicts several additional potential immunogenic regions (currently still
unexplored) that can then be used for generating optimized antigens, either in the form of
recombinant isolated domains or as synthetic peptide epitopes. Finally, our results help shed light on
the mechanistic bases of the large-conformational changes underpinning biologically relevant
functions of the protein.
To the best of our knowledge, this approach is one of the first that permits to discover epitopes in
the presence of glycosylation (an aspect that is often overlooked), starting only from the analysis of
the physico-chemical properties of the isolated antigen in solution. Importantly, the approach does
not require any prior knowledge of antibody binding sites of related antigenic homologs and does
not need to be trained/tuned with data sets or ad hoc combinations of information on sequences,
structures, SASA or geometric descriptors. The procedure is thus immediately and fully portable to
other antigens.
Results and Discussion

To reveal the regions of the S protein that could be involved in antibody (Ab) binding, we employ a
combination of the Energy Decomposition (ED) and MLCE (Matrix of Low Coupling Energies)
methods, which we previously introduced and validated21-32 and discuss in full in the Methods
section.
Starting from 6 combined 400 ns replicas of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the fully
glycosylated S protein in solution

13

(built from PDB ID: 6VSB 8 ), we isolate a representative frame

from each of the three most populated clusters. ED and MLCE analyses of protein energetics assess
the interactions that each aminoacid and glycan residue in S protomers establishes with every other
single residue in the same protomer. In particular, we compute the nonbonded part of the potential
energy (van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, solvent effects) implicitly, via an MM/GBSA

calculation (molecular mechanics/generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation)33,
obtaining, for a protomer composed of N residues (including monosaccharide residues on glycans), a
symmetric N × N interaction matrix Mij. Eigenvalue decomposition of Mij highlights the regions of
strongest and weakest coupling. The map of pairwise energy couplings can then be filtered with
topological information (namely, the residue-residue contact map) to identify localized surface
networks of low-intensity coupling (i.e., clusters of spatially close residue pairs whose energetic
coupling to the rest of the structure is weak and not energetically optimized through evolution).
In our model, when these fragments are located on or near the surface, contiguous in space and
weakly coupled to the protein’s ‘stability core’, they represent potential interaction regions (i.e.,
epitopes). Otherwise put, putative interacting patches are hypothesized to be characterized by nonoptimized intramolecular interactions. Actual binding to an external partner such as an Ab is expected
to occur if favorable intermolecular interactions determine a lower free energy for the bound than
the unbound state

21, 23, 34

. Furthermore, minimal energetic coupling with the rest of the protein

provides these subregions with greater conformational freedom to adapt to a binding partner and
improves their ability to absorb mutations without affecting the protein’s native organization and
stability in a way that could be detrimental for the pathogen: all these properties are indeed hallmarks
of Ab-binding epitopes.
Once interacting vicinal residue pairs (i, j)are identified by cross-comparison with the residue-residue
contact map (vide supra and Methods Section), identification of poorly coupled regions representing
potential epitopes proceeds as follows. Residue pairs are firstly ranked in order of increasing
interaction intensity (from weakest to strongest). Two distinct sets of energetically decoupled regions
are then mapped by applying two distinct cutoffs (‘softness thresholds’) to the residue pair list: either
from the first 15% or from the first 5% of the ranked pairs (i.e., the 5% or 15% of the residue pairs
with the weakest energetic coupling).
The less restrictive 15% cutoff subdivides the full-length, fully folded S protein into potentially
immunoreactive domains (see Figure 1B,C and Methods)22, 25, 34. The goal is to uncover regions that
may normally be hidden from recognition by Abs in the native protein structure, but that can be
experimentally expressed as isolated domains. Highly reactive neutralizing epitopes may in fact be
present only in specific but transient conformations that are not immediately evident in the static Xray and EM models of the protein or are not accessible even to large scale MD simulations. Presenting

these (cryptic) regions for Ab binding through their isolated parent domains may prove more
advantageous in developing new immunogens22, 25.
The more stringent epitope definition (5% cutoff) narrows the focus on those (smaller) intra-domain
regions that could be directly involved in forming the interface with Abs, and that can then be used
to guide the engineering of optimized antigens in the form of synthetic epitope peptidomimetics. In
this context, to be defined as epitopes, the energetically uncoupled regions must be at least 6-residue
long.
Upon using the larger cutoff value, a large cluster of energetically unoptimized residue pairs localize
at the Receptor Binding Domain, correctly identifying it as the most antigenic unit in the S protein’s
‘RBD up’ protomer (Figure 1B,C magenta colored domain). Interestingly, when the lowest energycoupled residue pairs are mapped onto the ‘up’ RBD of all three 3D structures isolated from MD,
there is a large overlap with regions recognized by Abs and nanobodies (revealed by recent X-ray and
cryo-EM structures). Importantly, for example, our calculation correctly identifies the binding region
of mAb CR302235, known to target a cryptic epitope that is exposed only upon significant structural
rearrangement of the protein 12 (Figures 2 and Figure 4).

A second domain that is found to host a large network of non-optimized interactions corresponds to
the N-terminal domain (Figure 1B, C, D). The latter has been shown to bind the new antibody 4A8 in
a paper that was published during the preparation of this manuscript 36.
A third region predicted to be highly antigenic coincides with the central/C-terminal part of the S1A
domain. In a recent cryo-EM study of polyclonal antibodies binding to the S protein, this substructure
was shown to be in the vicinity of the density for COV57 Fab(s), a novel Ab whose neutralizing activity
showed no correlation with that of RBD-targeting Abs 37 (Figure 1B, D).
Furthermore, MLCE identifies a potentially highly reactive region in the S2 domain of the protein, in
the CD region. This domain contains the epitope recently found to engage with 1A9 38, an antibody
recently shown to cross-react with S proteins of human, civet, and batcoronaviruses. This analysis
also recognizes a potential antigenic region in a carbohydrate cluster located in the S2 domain of the
protein: intriguingly, recent findings indicate that an oligosaccharide-containing epitope centered
around this predicted region is targeted by the glycan-dependent antibody HIV-1 bnAb 2G12

39

(Figure 1, 2).
The identification of energetically uncoupled domains also has mechanistic implications. Regions that
are not involved in major intramolecular stabilizing interactions with the rest of the biomolecule can
be displaced at minimal energetic costs, sustaining the large-scale conformational changes that
typically underpin biological functionality. The boundary of the uncoupled N-terminal region (Figure
1, dark green domain) lies in physical proximity to the furin-targeted motif RRAR, essential for preactivation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike through proteolysis. In this framework, the uncoupling of a large part
of the N-domain can synergize with (and favor through domain-displacement) the cleavage of
specifically evolved furin motif to favor the detachment of S1-domain and the release of the S2 fusion
machinery8-10, 40. Furthermore, the beta-sheet at the initial boundary of the C-terminal domain in the
S2 (Red domain in Figure 1) is in close physical proximity to the fusion peptide (Figure 1D, E). It is
tempting to suggest here that the release or conformational rearrangements of the C-terminal
domain would be favored by its non-optimized interactions with the core of the stalk of the protein,
optimally exposing the fusion peptide and favoring its integration with the host membrane 40.
Overall, these findings support the validity of our approach in identifying protein domains that can
be aptly used as highly reactive immunogens, as they are most likely to be targeted by a humoral
immune response. Our analysis predicts that regions other than the S protein RBD may represent

alternative targets for neutralization or functional perturbation of SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, this
may be important considering the fact that RBD can also be the target on non-neutralizing antibodies,
e.g. 3022 35. Indeed, using cocktails of antibodies to target different regions of S has recently been
proposed as a viable therapeutic option 36.
Turning to our more stringent definition of epitope, based exclusively on the top 5% of the
most weakly coupled residue pairs (5% cutoff), we next focus on those regions of the S antigen that
can be involved in forming contacts with antibodies.
Importantly, one predicted conformational epitope with sequence (348)A-(352)A-(375)S(434)IAWNS(438)-(442)DSKVGG(447)-(449)YNYL(452)-(459)S-(465)E-(491)PLQS(494)-(496)Q(507)PYR(509) encompasses regions of the S protein in contact with antibodies C105 (6xcn.pdb)37,

Interestingly, an additional predicted patch comprising a set of decorating carbohydrates is correctly
predicted to be part of the interface with antibody S309 (6wpt.pdb; 6wps.pdb) 41, with aminoacidic
sequence (332)ITNLC(336)-(361)C and with (N334-linked) carbohydrate sequence β-D-GlcNAc–(α-LFuc)–β-D-GlcNAc–β-D-Man (i.e., UYB-(0fA)-4YB-VMB according to the GLYCAM naming convention
43

).This predicted region sits notably close to the RBD interaction surface with ACE2.

Antibody EY6A (6zdh.pdb) binds the RBD in the region of the cryptic epitope described by Wilson and
collaborators35 (Figure 4). Importantly, our predicted patch (365)YSVLYN(370)-(384)PTKLN(388)
covers a significant part of the epitope. Once again, it is worth remarking that identification of this
potentially immunoreactive patch is simply and exclusively obtained from structural and energetic
interaction data generated for a protomer of the glycosylated, isolated S protein, after simulation
with a general use forcefield (see Methods section).

indicating substantial contact formation with the antibody.

With the more restrictive epitope prediction cutoff we clearly identify a reactive area in the Nterminal domain of the Spike protein. The predicted patch (184)GN(185)-(242)LAL(244)-(246)R(248)Y-(258)WTAGA(262) contains residues R246 and W258 which were described as central
determinants for contact between the N-terminal domain and antibody 4A8 36 (Figure 5).

Finally, the restrictive prediction identifies the sequence spanning residues 1076-1146, which
includes amino acids 1111-1130, experimentally identified as the epitope for the monoclonal mAb
1A9 38. Specifically our identified reactive sequence is the following: (1076) TTAPAICH(1083)-(1087)A-

In general, our approach is able to identify potential immunoreactive domains and epitopes of the
Spike protein based only on structural and energetic information. Sequences predicted to be reactive
using the restrictive epitope definition (5% cutoff) can be used for generating optimized antigens in
the form of synthetic peptide epitopes. Engineering such epitopes would entail the synthesis of
conformationally preorganized peptidomimetics of the ‘natural’ reactive regions—with intra- and
extracellular stability enhanced through, e.g, a combination of natural and non-natural aminoacids—
which could reproduce the main structural and energetic conditions required to elicit a humoral
immune response, as well as constituting candidates for vaccine development. Furthermore, reactive
peptides thus identified may be suitable for use as baits in serologic diagnostic applications (e.g., in
ELISA assays and in microarrays), to capture and detect to capture and detect not only circulating
antibodies that are expressed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections but also those that are endowed
with neutralization activity and thus potentially predicting the infection outcome. As a further
application, these peptide-based baits can represent a useful tool for isolating new mAbs and the
screening of small molecules for drug development.

One the most significant aspects of our approach is that the S protein’s entire glycan shield is explicitly
accounted for in the prediction of the immunoreactive regions. Indeed, the various oligosaccharide
chains appear to behave differently (see differential coloring of oligosaccharide chains in Figure 1). In
light of their stronger energetic coupling to other areas of the protein, some of the glycans are not
recognized as epitopes, and thus form an integral part of the stabilizing intramolecular interaction
network of S (white chains in Figure 1B); on the other hand, MLCE also identifies a second subset of
poorly coupled oligosaccharides as potentially reactive epitopes (or part thereof) (colored
oligosaccharide chains in Figure 1B; carbohydrate cluster in S2 targeted by the glycan-dependent
antibody HIV-1 bnAb 2G12, see Figure 1B, 2), highlighting potential vulnerable spots in the glycan
shield that could be exploited to design novel immunoreagents and vaccine candidates.
The portion of the glycan shield falling within the former category thus mainly serves to protect the
protein from recognition by antibodies and consequently enhances viral infectiousness, as well as
providing extra structural support. Two such glycans are further exemplified in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Glycans with different roles on Spike. A) The glycan chain attached to N234, which is predicted to be part of the

networks of stabilizing interactions within the protein. B) The glycan chain attached to N165 is predicted to play a double
role, a stabilizing one (yellow units) and an immunoreactive one (orange untis).

The first is the entire oligosaccharide fragment bound to N234 (Figure 6A), which is recognized by
Amaro and coworkers as being crucial in ‘propping up’ the RBD12. Experimental deletion of N-glycans
at this position by way of a mutation to Ala significantly modifies the conformational landscape of the
protein’s RBD 44. The second is the portion of the N165-linked glycan whose subunits are rendered
in yellow (Figure 6B): consistent with experimental studies indicating N165-linked oligosaccharides

as structural modulators 44, we also find that the portion in question is not identified as a potential
epitope, being consequently involved in diverting antibodies from targeting the region around N165
and thus preserving control of the S protein’s structural dynamics.
Reflecting the multifaceted roles of the glycan shield, the remaining part of the N165-linked glycan
(Figure 6B; orange) appears instead to belong to the category of glycans that are potentially able to
act as epitopes, since, unlike the part in yellow, we do detect it to be decoupled from the rest of the
protomer.
lt is particularly significant to underline that MLCE, whose physical basis is to identify non-optimized
interaction networks, detects peptidic epitopes even when they are in proximity of (optimized, nonimmunogenic) shielding carbohydrates. In light of this, it is reasonable to suggest that the protective
effect of these particular carbohydrates may be circumvented and neutralized by exposing the
underlying peptidic substructures. Furthermore, information on oligosaccharides identified as
epitope constituents can be exploited to design glycomimics or glycosylated peptides as synthetic
epitopes.
The latter aspect is indeed particularly relevant: small synthetic molecules that mimic antigenic
determinants (and effectively act as their minimal surrogates) offer enticing opportunities to develop
immunoreagents with superior characteristics in terms of ease of handling, reproducibility of batchto-batch production, ease of purification, sustainable cost, and better stability under a variety of
conditions. Furthermore, production of these molecules greatly reduces the risk of cross-reactivity
with any copurified antigens, which is instead rife when dealing with recombinant proteins. In
contrast to smaller peptides or sugar-decorated peptidomimetics, a full-length recombinant
antigenic protein (or any protein-based detection device) would typically require more stringent
conditions (e.g., in terms of temperature and humidity) for storage, transport, and management in
order to preserve the protein in its properly folded active form. The same would be true for other
vaccinal solutions such as deactivated pathogens.
Overall, our work confirms how simple and transparent structural and physico-chemical
understanding of the molecule that is the key player in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection can be harnessed
to guide the prediction of (in some cases experimentally confirmed) regions, that are involved in
immune recognition and to understand its molecular bases. Agreement with experiment confirms

that knowledge generated in the process has the potential of being translated into new molecules
for vaccine and diagnostic development. In this context, we have also identified potentially reactive
regions in the S protein stalk that are currently under experimental synthesis and testing.
Furthermore, the potential functional implications offered by the approach are illustrated by the fact
that important domains/regions for the biological activation of the protein are naturally identified.
This would give confidence for applying the method to understand the fine mechanistic determinants
of possible new emerging mutants of the protein, expected to appear as the diffusion and hostadaptation of the virus progress. Finally, the possibility of accurately partitioning such a complex
system in functional subunits could aptly be exploited in the parameterization of coarse-grained
models for the description of the system at different length-scales.
This kind of structure-based computational approach can clearly expand the scope of simple
structural analysis and molecular simulations. In applicative terms, generation of synthetic libraries
based on predicted/identified epitopes (with possible addition of sugars) would definitely boost
selection and screening of antigens for vaccine development.

Methods

STRUCTURE SELECTION FROM MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (RBD CLUSTERING)

Coordinates of the fully glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein’s ‘RBD up’ protomer featured in this work
originate from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by Woods and coworkers 13, based on PDB ID:
6VSB. Throughout this work, we retain exactly the same forcefield parameters used by Woods et al.
in their MD simulations: all residues except glycosylated asparagines are treated using the ff14SB
forcefield,

45

whereas glycans and glycosylated asparagines are modeled using the GLYCAM_06j

forcefield 43.
Clustering is based on root-mean-squared deviation of Cα atoms of the RBD domain in the ‘RBD up’
protomer, and performed with the cpptraj utility in AmberTools (version 17)46, after concatenating
all six independent MD replicas

13

and aligning them with the ‘autoimage’ command. The chosen

method is the Hierarchical Agglomerative Algorithm 47, with an epsilon value of 0.5. From each of the
three most populated clusters, we isolate one representative frame, from which we retain the ‘RBD
up’ protomer and its glycans, whilst again using cpptraj to discard all solvent molecules, ions, and the
two ‘RBD down’ protomers. All subsequent calculations on these three ‘RBD up’ protomer models
are listed chronologically in the subsections that follow.

MINIMZATION

A 200-step minimization of each of the three protomer models is carried out using the default
procedure (i.e., steepest descent for 10 steps; then conjugate gradient) implemented in the MD
engine sander in the AMBER software package (version 18) )46. Protomers are minimized using the
generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent model as parametrized by Onufriev et al. 48, with a universal
12.0 Å cutoff applied in the calculation of Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions (neither of which
are calculated beyond this limit). For this stage, concentration of (implicit) mobile counterions in the
GB model is set to 0.1 M, and the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is computed according to
the LCPO method (linear combinations of pairwise overlaps) 49.

MM/GBSA CALCULATIONS

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.214254; this version posted July 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

MM/GBSA calculations 33 are performed on each of the three minimized ‘RBD up’ protomers using
the dedicated mm_pbsa.pl utility in AmberTools (version 17). The purpose of these calculations is to
obtain a breakdown of nonbonded energy interactions (i.e., electrostatic, van der Waals, implicit
solvation contributions and, in this case, 1-4 interactions) between every possible pair of residues in
the protomer (aminoacids and monosaccharides alike): for a protomer composed of N residues, this
leads to a symmetric 𝑁 × 𝑁 interaction matrix 𝑀%& . 50-51
The implicit GB solvation model used in these calculations is identical to the one used in the preceding
minimization step (vide supra), except that the implicit ion concentration is set to 0.0 M, and SASA is
computed with the ICOSA method (based on icosahedra around each atom that are progressively
refined to spheres).
ENERGY DECOMPOSITION

The symmetric interaction matrix 𝑀%& obtained from separate MM/GBSA calculations (vide supra) on
each of the three S protein protomer models under study (with 𝑁 residues) can be expressed in terms
of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors as
,

𝑀%& = ( 𝜆* 𝑣%* 𝑣&*
*-.

where 𝜆* is the a-th eigenvalue and 𝑣%* is the ith component of the corresponding eigenvector.
It was previously shown in a number of cases that eigenvector (𝑣. ), also called first eigenvector,
associated with the lowest eigenvalue𝜆. allows to identify most of the crucial aminoacids necessary
for the stabilization of a protein fold, and consequently those aminoacids that are minimally coupled
to such core. The latter were shown to correspond to potential interaction regions.
In the case of multidomain proteins such as S, the first eigenvector is not sufficient, and more
eigenvectors are needed to capture the essential interactions for folding/stability and binding. The
interaction matrix 𝑀%& is thus decomposed instead via the alternative approach developed by Genoni
et al. 34. In this scenario, the aim is to select the smallest set of 𝑁/ eigenvectors that cover the largest
part of residues (i.e., components) with the minimum redundancy under the assumption that: (a) for
each domain there should exist only one associated eigenvector recapitulating its most significant
interactions; (b) each “domain eigenvector” has a block structure whereby its significant components
correspond to the residues belonging to the identified domain; (c) combination of all significant
blocks covers all residues in the protein. Matrix 𝑀%& can thus be reformulated as a simplified matrix
0%& :
𝑀

pairs in the protomer that exhibit the strongest and weakest energetic interactions.
MLCE

Final epitope predictions are made using the Matrix of Local Coupling Energies method (MLCE), in
which analysis of a given protein’s energetic properties is combined with that of its structural
determinants 21, 23. This approach allows to identify nonoptimized, contiguous regions on the protein
surface that are deemed to have minimal coupling energies with the rest of the structure, and that
have a greater propensity for recognition by Abs or other binding partners.
The MLCE procedure entails cross-comparison of the simplified pairwise residue-residue energy
0%& resulting from domain decomposition (vide supra) with a pairwise residueinteraction matrix 𝑀
residue contact matrix 𝐶%& . The latter matrix namely considers a pair of residues to be spatially
contiguous (i.e., ‘in contact’) if they are closer than an arbitrary 6.0 Å-threshold; contact distances
are measured between Cβ atoms in the case of non-glycine aminoacid residues, H atoms in the case
of glycine residues, and between C1 atoms in the case of glycan residues.
The Hadamard product of the two matrices yields the matrix of the local pairwise coupling energies
𝑀𝐿𝐶𝐸%& :
0%& ∙ 𝐶%&
𝑀𝐿𝐶𝐸%& = 𝑀
Deriving the MLCE matrix allows to rank spatially contiguous residue pairs with respect to the
strength of their energetic interactions (weakest to strongest). Selection of proximal pairs showing
the weakest coupling with the rest of the protein ultimately defines putative epitopes; two distinct
selections are carried out on the basis of two possible weakness (softness) cutoffs (5% or 15%),
corresponding to the top 5% or 15% spatially contiguous residue pairs with the lowest energetic
interactions.
