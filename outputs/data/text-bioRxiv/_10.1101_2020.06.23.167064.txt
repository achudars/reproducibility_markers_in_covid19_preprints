Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID19
pandemic, is a highly pathogenic β-coronavirus. As
other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped,
replicates in the cytoplasm and assembles at
intracellular membranes. Here, we structurally
characterize the viral replication compartment and
report critical insights into the budding mechanism of
the virus, and the structure of extracellular virions close
to their native state by in situ cryo-electron tomography
and subtomogram averaging. We directly visualized
RNA filaments inside the double membrane vesicles,
compartments associated with viral replication. The
RNA filaments show a diameter consistent with doublestranded RNA and frequent branching likely
representing RNA secondary structures. We found that
assembled S trimers in lumenal cisternae do not alone
induce membrane bending but laterally reorganize on
the envelope during virion assembly. The viral
ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are accumulated
at the curved membrane characteristic for budding sites
suggesting that vRNP recruitment is enhanced by
membrane curvature. Subtomogram averaging shows
that vRNPs are distinct cylindrical assemblies. We
propose that the genome is packaged around multiple
separate
vRNP
complexes,
thereby
allowing
incorporation of the unusually large coronavirus
genome into the virion while maintaining high steric
flexibility between the vRNPs.
Coronaviridae is a large family of single-stranded positivesense (+)RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrate
hosts. β-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle
Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
are highly contagious pathogens that can cause severe
lower respiratory infections. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV2 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, likely through
zoonotic transmission via a bat reservoir and a still
unidentified intermediate host that subsequently led to a
pandemic3, affecting over 17 million individuals and causing
close to 700,000 deaths worldwide5.

(revised version, 14. August 2020)

Cryo-electron microscopy studies of SARS-CoV-1 and the
closely related murine hepatitis virus (MHV) show that the
virions are predominantly spherical or ellipsoidal with an
average envelope diameter between 80 and 90 nm6. The
main structural components of coronaviruses are the
glycoprotein S, the transmembrane proteins M and E and
the nucleoprotein N, which forms a viral ribonucleoprotein
(vRNP) complex with the viral RNA (vRNA). SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV-1 S are structurally similar glycosylated
homotrimers2,7 that bind to the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the cell surface of
permissive cells8. Similar to other (+)RNA viruses9,
coronaviruses modify cellular membranes to form doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs), which are used as dedicated
sites for vRNA replication10. Several studies of SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV point towards DMVs being derived from
ER cisternae in a process predominantly driven by the
nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) and nsp411. In this model, the
ER lumen constitutes the space between the DMV’s inner
and outer membrane, while the enclosed space is of
cytoplasmic origin and enriched in double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA)12. A recent study by Wolff et al.13 identified a
molecular pore complex which interconnects the DMV
interior with the cytoplasm, possibly allowing RNA import
and export. SARS-CoV-1 M, E and N are required for virion
assembly14 that takes place on the cytoplasmic side of the
ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) cisternae15,16.
M and E proteins act as an assembly hub, interacting with
both N and S proteins, thus ensuring vRNP incorporation
into the nascent virion17,18.
Here, we used cryo-electron tomography (ET) on cryofocused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milled lamellae or whole cell
cryo-ET of various SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, which
were chemically fixed for biosafety reasons, to structurally
characterize DMV morphology, virus assembly, and
extracellular virions close to their native state. In addition to
commonly used monkey kidney derived VeroE6 cells, we
included the human pulmonary cell lines Calu3 and A549,
the latter stably expressing the ACE2 receptor (A549ACE2), which renders these cells permissive for SARSCoV-2 as reported for SARS-CoV-119 (Fig. S1a–c). Although

To provide further structural information on how DMV fusion
is mechanistically governed, DMVs within close proximity to
each other were analyzed (Fig. 2). Besides funnel-like
connections (Fig. 2a), we observed tightly apposed DMVs
where all four membranes were stacked, forming a curved
junction budding into juxtaposed DMVs (Fig. 2b, c). The
junction appeared to be electron-dense, yet no particular
features were found between the individual membranes.
The membrane stack at the center of the junction had an
average thickness of 19.4 nm (SD = 2.7 nm, n = 4),

approximately conforming to four lipid bilayers. Consistent
with a recent study, we also found vesicle packets (VPs)
containing two or more vesicles surrounded by one outer
membrane, presumably a product of DMV-DMV outer
membrane fusion (Fig. 2d–f)24. In one case, we observed
that the inner membranes of the DMVs formed a junction
that resulted in an opening between two fusing inner
vesicles (Fig. 2f). Based on these observations, we propose
that DMV homotypic fusion occurs through membrane
stacking engaging predominantly the outer, and less
frequently also the inner membranes. Tight
membrane apposition together with high
DMV
curvature might energetically contribute to
membrane fusion or to a membrane rupture
DMV
followed by membrane resealing. Since
DMV
DMV fusion leads to a minimization of
membrane surface to volume ratio and the
number of VPs increases during the
infection24, we speculate that DMV fusion is
required for repurposing membranes for
virion budding at advanced stages of the
replication cycle, which is supported by the
observation of a fully assembled virion
inside the VP lumen (Fig. 2d).

The ERGIC constitutes the main assembly
site of coronaviruses15 and budding events
have been described by EM studies12,25,26. In
situ cryo-ET allowed us here for the first time
to study SARS-CoV-2 virion assembly in
close to native conditions and enabled us to
localize individual S trimers and vRNPs with
high precision. Virus-budding was mainly
clustered in regions with a high vesicle
density and close to ER- and Golgi-like
membrane arrangements (Fig. 3a, S5,
Movies S2, S3). S trimers were regularly
found in low quantities with the ectodomain
facing the ERGIC lumen. Even at high
concentrations, in the absence of vRNPs, S
trimer accumulation did not coincide with
positive membrane curvature (Fig. 3b, c),
indicating that S alone is unable to initiate
virus budding. This is consistent with a study
showing that SARS-CoV-1 virus-like
particles are formed and released in the
absence of S14. Early budding events with a
positively curved membrane were decorated
on the lumenal side with S and on the
cytosolic side with vRNPs as separate
cylindrical complexes (Fig. 3d, e) in all
observed events (n = 19). This suggests that
vRNPs may contribute to membrane
curvature after recruitment to the membrane
by the M protein or they might accumulate
preferentially at curved membranes. Unlike

(e.g.

data show that M does not form

showing
that

In contrast, virions that were
more distant from the membrane
showed a dispersed distribution
of S (Fig. 3g) around the entire
virion, indicating that S trimers
are mobile on the virion
envelope and redistribute during
the budding process. Thus, the

Further analysis of the structure
of intracellular virions revealed
that S trimers are not always
oriented orthogonally to the
membrane of the spherical
virions (Fig. S4). We observed
tilting angles up to 41° (Fig. S4d)
of S trimers on intracellular
virions, supporting the observation in two recent studies29,30
that report that S trimers can tilt up to 60° in purified virions.
Importantly, our study rules out that this tilting is caused by
forces exerted on the virion during ultracentrifugation or
blotting during the sample preparation, since the intracellular
virions were protected during sample preparation by the
cellular environment. Previous ultrastructural studies of
other coronaviruses reported average virion diameters of 85
± 5 nm for MHV6 and 88 ± 6 nm for SARS-CoV-128. We did
not observe significant differences in the average diameters
of virions derived from the three cell lines (Fig. 4c) and
calculated an average diameter of 89.8 nm (SD = 13.7 nm,
n = 74). Subtomogram averaging (STA) of 219 individual S
trimers from intracellular virions yielded a low resolution
structure with a total height of approximately 25 nm
measured from the virion envelope and a total width of 13
nm (Fig. 4d–f, S5). The density map featured a well-defined

trimeric structure with a height of 16 nm which is in
agreement with the published structure solved by single
particle analysis of the purified S ectodomain in pre-fusion
conformation truncated at serine residue 1147
(PDB:6VXX)2, indicating that the S trimer is fully formed
during virion budding and that samples are well preserved
despite the chemical fixation step that we had to use for
biosafety reasons. The approximately 9 nm long gap
between the trimeric density and the virion envelope that can
be attributed to the triple-stranded coiled-coil heptad repeat
2 (HR2) was not resolved, because of the presence of three
flexible hinges in the stem region as shown by two recent
studies29,30. To estimate the number of S trimers per virion,
we extracted the 3D coordinates of all identifiable S trimers
on nine intracellular virions and determined the average
nearest-neighbor distance to be 23.6 nm (SD = 8.1 nm, n =
100) (Fig. 4g). Based on the mathematical problem of

In contrast, a high concentration of virions from VeroE6 cells
were covering the surface of filopodia and protrusions that
interconnected neighboring cells (Fig. 5b, S9). Similar
observations have been made in a recent study on VeroE6
and Caco-2 cells showing that SARS-CoV-2 infection
induces the formation of virion decorated filopodia34. These
observations are reminiscent of the cell-to-cell transmission
via viral surfing as reported for HIV35 and could argue for a
yet undescribed mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. In

side, the other side appears more flexible
with two pillar-like densities creating an

isolated from MHV and SARS-CoV-1
virions
described
a
helical
nucleocapsid6,43 or a coiled vRNP that
forms a membrane-proximal lattice28.
Here, we propose that vRNPs are
f
composed of N proteins in complex with
the viral genome, which links neighboring
vRNPs like ‘beads on a string’. This would
allow for efficient packing of the unusually
large vRNA genome into the virus
particles while maintaining high steric
flexibility between the individual vRNPs
required during their incorporation into
budding virions. Based on our data, we
can clearly distinguish individual vRNPs,
while it remains to be investigated how
the individual N proteins and RNA are
organized in the vRNPs.

Our report provides in situ cryo-ET
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and induced
DMVs at high preservation levels. Direct
visualization of DMVs unveils a high
concentration of branched double
stranded RNA filaments as the major
constituents of the DMV interior. Given
the lack of protein densities in the DMV
interior, it is conceivable that the viral
replicase complex is tightly associated
with the inner DMV membrane and
releases vRNA into the DMV lumen.
Alternatively, the DMV interior might
serve the selective accumulation of RNA
intermediates that are imported into the
DMV via the recently discovered pore
complex13 to evade the antiviral innate
immune response. Our data indicate that
S trimers alone do not induce membrane

curvature during budding into the ERGIC lumen but are
remarkably motile and flexible. We report that vRNPs are
individual complexes that are often associated with the
membrane and likely contribute to or require membrane
curvature for their incorporation into budding virions. We
propose that the cylindrical assembly of vRNPs enables
efficient packaging of the genome in a nucleosome-like
fashion.
Methods
Cells and viruses
VeroE6, HEK293T and A549 cells were obtained from
ATCC and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml
streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM complete).
Calu3 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Manfred Frey,
Mannheim and were maintained in DMEM complete
supplemented with 10 mM sodium pyruvate and a final
concentration of 20% FBS. For generation of A549 cells
stably expressing ACE2, lentivirus was generated by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with pWPI plasmid encoding
for ACE2 and the pCMV-Gag-Pol and pMD2-VSV-G
packaging plasmids (kind gifts from Dr. D. Trono, Geneva).
Supernatant containing lentiviruses were harvested two
days post-transfection, filtered through a 0.44 µm filter and
used for transduction of A549 cells followed by selection with
neomycin (0.5 mg/ml). The Bavpat1/2020 SARS-CoV-2
virus isolate (provided by Prof. Christian Drosten at the
Charité in Berlin, Germany, and provided by the European
Virology Archive (Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) was used. A
passage 4 working stock of this isolate was generated by
passaging the virus twice in VeroE6 cells.
Sample inactivation by chemical fixation
Cells (VeroE6, Calu3, A549-ACE2) were seeded in 35 mm
Petri dishes containing Quantifoil 200 mesh R2/2 Au or Ti
grids at seeding density of 2×105 cells/dish one day before
infection. A549-ACE2, Calu3 and VeroE6 were infected at
different MOI (Table S1) with SARS-CoV-2, respectively.
For optimal sample preservation, all fixation steps were
performed
with
electron
microscopy
grade
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
and Glutaraldehyde (GA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
and all fixation solutions were buffered in 0.1 M PHEM buffer
at pH 7.4. Infected cells were chemically fixed at 16 hpi by
addition of a double-concentrated fixative solution (8% PFA,
0.2% GA, 0.2 M PHEM buffer, pH 7.4) directly into an equal
volume of growing medium for 10 min at RT. Subsequently,
the medium containing fixative was removed, and cells were
chemically fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4%
PFA and 0.1% GA, 0.1 M PHEM buffer, pH 7.4. For a
comparison of structure preservation, a subset of samples
was inactivated by using 4% PFA and 0.1% GA in 0.1 M
(revised version, 14. August 2020)

PHEM, pH 7.4 for 30 min at RT omitting the doubleconcentrated fixative solution. Finally, all 35 mm dishes
containing infected cells were completely submerged into a
container with 100 ml of 4% PFA in 0.1 M PHEM, pH 7.4 and
carried out of the BSL3 facility to be immediately plungefrozen.
Plaque assay
VeroE6 cells were seeded into 24 well plates at seeding
density of 2.5×105 cells/well. Serial dilutions of infectious
supernatants were prepared and added to the cells in
duplicates. Infection was performed at 37°C for 1 h followed
by removal of the supernatants and overlaying with 1 ml of
plaquing medium (0.8% carboxymethyl-cellulose in MEM).
Cells were incubated at 37°C for three days followed by
fixation in 5% formaldehyde for 1 h. Plates were submerged
in a solution of 6% formaldehyde for 30 min before being
carried out of the BSL3 area. Plates were washed with water
and 1 ml of staining solution (1% crystal violet in 10%
ethanol) was added for 15 min. Staining solution was
removed, plates were rinsed again with water, plaques were
counted, and titers were calculated.
Light microscopy
Infected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
Plates were then submerged in a solution of 6%
formaldehyde for 30 min before being carried out of the
BSL3 area. Samples were rinsed twice in PBS,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS for 10 min,
rinsed again twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h with
blocking buffer containing 2% milk in PBS. Samples were
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer
for 1h at RT, washed 3 times in washing buffer (PBS, 0.02%
Tween-20) and incubated with secondary antibodies for 45
min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on glass
slides with Fluoromount-G mounting media containing
DAPI.
RT-qPCR
The NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel) was
used to isolate total intracellular RNA according to the
manufacturer’s specification. cDNA was synthesized from
the total RNA using a high capacity cDNA reverse
transcription (RT) kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to
the manufacturer’s specifications. Each cDNA sample was
diluted 1:15 and used directly for qPCR analysis using
specific primers and the iTaq Universal SYBR green
mastermix (Bio-Rad). Primers for qPCR were designed
using the Primer3 software44: ACE2 (forward) 5’CACGAAGGTCCTCTGCACAA-3’, ACE2 (reverse) 5’ATGCTAGGGTCCAGGGTTCT-3,

obtain the relative abundance of specific RNAs from each
sample, cycle threshold (ct) values were corrected for the
PCR efficiency of the specific primer set and normalized to

transcript levels.
Sample processing for cryo-EM
To generate the dataset for this study, 3 independent
infections of cells grown on electron microscopy grids were
done for A549-ACE2 cells and one infection on VeroE6 and
Calu3 cells. Detailed overview of sample processing is
shown in Table S1. Tomograms containing cellular
structures that were partially compromised by fixation or
poor vitrification as apparent from increased local
membrane undulation and increased aggregation in the
cytosol were excluded from the analysis.
Plunge freezing
Chemically fixed infected cells grown on grids were plungefrozen in liquid ethane cooled to -183°C by liquid nitrogen
using a Leica GP2 plunger. Before plunge freezing, 3 µl of
0.1 M PHEM buffer pH 7.4 was applied on a grid in the
chamber set to 70% humidity and 24°C. Grids were blotted
for 3 seconds using No. 1 Whatman paper and clipped into
Autogrids (ThermoFisher Scientific) dedicated for cryo-FIB
milling and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Cryo-focused ion beam milling
Lamellae were prepared using a focused Gallium ion beam
on an Aquilos dual-beam FIB-SEM microscope at the stage
temperature around -180°C (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells
positioned in the center of the grid squares were selected for
milling and the eucentric height for each of the cells was set
using the routines in the MAPS software. An organo-metallic
platinum protective layer was applied for 5 – 6 sec onto the
cells before milling. Rough milling was performed gradually
in 4 steps at a stage angle of 15-18° using a Ga+ beam to
obtain 500 nm thick lamellae. Final milling was performed at
the end of the milling session to yield lamellae with nominal
thickness of 150 nm. To minimize lamella bending, a microexpansion joints milling pattern was applied as described by
Wolff et al.45. Progress was monitored by SEM imaging at
2.2-10 kV with ETD and T2 detectors.
Cryo-electron tomography
Cryo-electron tomography was performed using the Titan
Krios cryo-TEM (ThermoFisher Scientific) operated at
300kV equipped with a K3 direct electron detector and a
Gatan imaging filter (Gatan) in EFTEM nanoprobe mode.
Lamellae or whole cells were mapped at a magnification of
6,500× at defocus -50 μm to localize DMVs and virions. Tilt
series were acquired at magnifications of 26,000×; 33,000×
or 64,000× (corresponding pixel sizes at the specimen level:
3.356 Å and 2.671 Å, 1.379 Å respectively) using SerialEM
46
. A dose-symmetric acquisition scheme47 with a constant
(revised version, 14. August 2020)

electron dose of approx. 3 e-/Å2 per projection, target
defocus ranging from -5 to -2.5 μm and energy filter slit at
20 eV was used covering the tilt range from 60° to -60° with
3° increments. When possible, tilt series acquired on
lamellae were tilted to 6° as a starting angle to compensate
for the pre-tilt of the lamella with respect to the grid.
Individual projections were acquired in counting mode using
dose fractionation. 10 – 20 individual frames per projections
were aligned and summed on-the-fly using the SEMCCD
plugin in SerialEM.
Tomogram reconstruction and volume rendering
Tilt series (TS) were aligned and reconstructed with the
IMOD software package48. The stack was aligned using
patch tracking for TS acquired on lamellae or gold fiducial
markers for TS acquired in the periphery of whole cells. After
CTF correction by phase-flipping and dose-filtration, the final
reconstruction was performed by weighted back-projection
with a SIRT-like filter equivalent to 10 iterations. For volume
rendering, the pre-aligned TS stack from IMOD was
reconstructed and denoised with the cryo-CARE library
using the Tomo2Tomo even-odd scheme1 on 4x binned
data. This denoised tomogram was further processed with
Amira 2019.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the
Membrane Enhancement Filter with a feature scale of 6.5
nm. An initial segmentation was created using the Top-hat
tool. Based on this initial segmentation, membranes were
fully segmented in a manual fashion.
Subtomogram averaging
To obtain the average of the S trimer present on the surface
of intracellular virions during and after budding into the
ERGIC, 219 positions corresponding to the center of the S
trimers on the virion surface were manually picked from 6
tomograms acquired on cryo-lamellae using the general
model available in Dynamo49. Subsequently, subtomograms
with a cubic side length of 160 voxels size were cropped
from tomograms and were iteratively aligned against a
reference composed of two overlapping cylinders
approximately matching the S trimer and globular region
diameters. C3 symmetry was applied during the alignment
steps since the C3 symmetry was revealed when it was not
imposed (Fig. S7A). The atomic structures of the pre-fusion
SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (PDB:6VXX)2 and the HR2
domain of SARS-CoV-1 (PDB:2FXP)4 were automatically
using the fitting tool or manually placed into the density map
in ChimeraX50, respectively. The average of the vRNP
complexes within extracellular virions was obtained from
1570 particles manually picked from 15 tomograms using
the general model in Dynamo. Subtomograms with a cubic
side length of 168 voxels were cropped and 200 particles
were iteratively averaged using a cylindrical mask adjusted
to the dimensions of the vRNP to obtain a reference
template. The initial average was then used as a template to
obtain a refined average using 1570 particles.

Estimation of number of S trimers per virion
Arranging a specific number of points on a sphere with a
largest possible minimum distance between any point is a
mathematical problem called ‘Tammes Problem’31 or the 7th
unsolved mathematical problem listed by Steve Smale51. It
has been solved only for a few configurations32, although
was heuristically approximated for others52. Based on these
estimates and considering two simplified postulates, i.e. (i)
virions are spherical and (ii) S trimers are evenly distributed
on the viral envelope, we can determine the number of S
trimers per virion.
First, we determined the average distance of S trimers on
SARS-CoV-2 virions. S trimers were manually picked in
reconstructed tomograms using the IMOD software
package48 and their 3D-coordinates were extracted. For
each individual S trimer, the nearest neighboring S trimer on
the same virion was identified and the Euclidean distance
was calculated using the pandas and numpy software
libraries53,54. If two S trimers were reciprocal nearest
neighbors, their distance was counted only once. To
estimate the mean number of S trimers per virion, we
calculated the central angle for two points on a sphere
(Equation 1) with the previously determined average virion
diameter and S trimer distance. The error of the central
angle calculation was determined by error propagation
(Equation 2). By comparing the determined central angle
with the estimated results for configurations of N points on a
sphere by Slalone et al.52 (Fig. S6d), we can determine the
total number of S trimers per virion.

Measurement of phospholipid bilayer distance of
membranes
Membrane thickness of the virion envelope and cellular
membranes was measured as the distance between
phospholipid head groups of the bilayer. Line density
profiles (10 pixels in width, 0.41 Å/pixel) of approximately 20
nm in length were determined across the respective
membrane using the plot profile tool in FIJI/ImageJ55. For
(revised version, 14. August 2020)

each membrane, 49 – 129 measurements were performed
and normalized against the maxima of each measurement
separately. Densities were aligned to the first maxima and
plotted against the distance from the start of the line profile.
The distances between the two global maxima
corresponding to the phospholipid bilayer were then
measured for each plot profile.
RNA segmentation and measurement of thickness
Tracing was done manually in Amira 2019.3 using the
filament editor in linear tracing mode. The reconstructed
tomogram was 4x binned and either SIRT-like filtered
equivalent to 10 iterations or denoised with cryo-CARE as
described above. The total filament lengths were extracted
from the resulting spatial graph statistics. The RNA filament
diameter was measured on the unbinned SIRT-like filtered
reconstructed tomogram in FIJI by smoothing the image
using gaussian blur (σ = 2 px) and measuring the line
profiles perpendicular to RNA filaments using FIJI’s plot
profile tool (10 pixels in width, 1.379 Å/pixel). The grey value
profiles were normalized, aligned to their respective maxima
and averaged. The diameter was defined as the distance
between the two centermost intersection points of the
normalized line profile with the line corresponding to the
average grey values of the DMV internal space.
