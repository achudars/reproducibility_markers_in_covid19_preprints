Abstract

22

Since the first reports of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged

23

in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, there have been considerable efforts to sequence the

24

causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as hCoV-19) and to make viral genomic

25

information available quickly on shared repositories. As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus

26

sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic

27

information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged

28

samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or

29

cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics.

30

Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples,

31

all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with

32

COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic

33

approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina

34

MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants ≥1%. In a clinical swab obtained from the

35

day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) ≥1% frequency,

36

primarily located in the largest gene – ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant

37

genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild

38

purifying selection throughout the genome. We see little to no evidence for positive selection or

39

ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 within cell culture or in the primary isolate evaluated in this

40

study.

bottlenecks. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a human host and from

46

cell culture on three distinct Vero cell lines using Illumina and ONT technologies. We show that

47

SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial passages on

Vero 76 cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be propagated in cell culture in preparation for in-

vitro and in-vivo studies without dramatic alterations of its genotype. However, we emphasize

50

the need to deep-sequence viral stocks prior to use in experiments to characterize sub-

consensus diversity that may alter outcomes.

Introduction

54

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and

55

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 has garnered worldwide

56

public health attention [1–5]. At the time of writing, the United States has the highest number of

57

confirmed cases among countries where this virus is circulating – 639,733 cases and 30,990

58

deaths.

59

The rapid spread and molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 has been tracked by sequencing

60

viruses from infected individuals. Within weeks of the virus being identified, the complete

61

genome was sequenced, and as of April 16th 2020, 9,330 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been

62

shared and used to track local transmission chains and global phylodynamics [6]. While

63

consensus-level data has been rapidly disseminated, few researchers have analyzed viral

64

diversity within samples below the consensus level.

65

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with 79-82% nucleotide identity shared with SARS-CoV, the

66

virus responsible for the 2002 - 2003 SARS epidemic [7, 8]. During the 2003 SARS outbreak the

67

virus was characterized as having gone through distinct evolutionary phases in human hosts.

68

Initially, an excess of nonsynonymous mutations in the spike (S) gene suggested that it might

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051011; this version posted April 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

69

be under positive selection, but this progressed into purifying selection later in the epidemic [9].

70

The ORF1a gene appeared to go through similar evolutionary phases as the S gene. In contrast

71

to ORF1a and S, the ORF1b gene appeared to have undergone strong purifying selection

72

throughout the 2003 SARS epidemic [9].

73

Though limited, in-vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 show low-frequency variants are detectable

74

within individual hosts and are likely due to random fluctuations in allele frequencies. One study

75

highlights an excess of nonsynonymous variants compared to synonymous variants among

76

these low-frequency variants, consistent with the possibility of ongoing diversifying selection in

77

SARS-CoV-2 viruses [10, 11]. Another recent study by Liu and colleagues highlights a deletion

78

in the Spike gene at nucleotide (nt) positions 23,585–23,599, encoding QTQTN, that flanks the

79

polybasic cleavage site in S1/S2. The authors observe this deletion arising in SARS-CoV-2

80

viruses following two passages in Vero E6 cells. This deletion is found in over 50% of samples

81

from Liu and colleagues, ranging in frequency from 8 to 33%, and is hypothesized to be

82

adaptive for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but may be less robust in vivo as it was only identified in 3 of

83

68 Chinese-origin clinical samples at sub-consensus levels [12].

84

To better understand evolutionary pressures affecting SARS-CoV-2 within a single infection, we

85

used sequence-independent, single-primer amplification (SISPA) to generate metagenomic

86

libraries sequenced in parallel on Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) and Illumina sequencing

87

platforms (Fig 1) [13, 14]. We obtained a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from an individual with

88

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the day of diagnosis, who originally presented with

89

symptoms in Madison, WI (hereafter referred to as the Madison patient). This case was

90

diagnosed in late January 2020 and was one of the first lab-confirmed cases in the United

91

States. We additionally characterized viral diversity following passage in cell culture in three

92

distinct cell types – Vero 76, Vero E6, and Vero STAT-1 knockout (KO). Passage in cell culture

93

is expected to alter allele frequencies and may even select for adaptive mutations that make

94

passaged viruses less representative of their genotypes and phenotypes in vivo. Global viral

95

evolution ultimately derives from selective pressures and population dynamics playing out within

96

and between individual hosts. In this study, we identify SNVs within a clinical specimen and

97

track what happened to them through multiple rounds of passage in culture and begin to

98

assemble a nuanced understanding of the evolution and ongoing adaptive potential of this

99

zoonotic virus.

Results

101

No consensus-level changes following two passages on Vero 76 cells

102

We obtained an NP swab from the day of diagnosis and passaged the virus on three distinct cell

103

lines – Vero 76, Vero E6, and Vero STAT-1 KO (Fig 1). To understand the effects of serial

104

passaging on SARS-CoV-2, we used the SISPA approach to generate full genome sequencing

105

libraries from the original NP swab and passaged virus (S1 Fig). Sequences were analyzed in

106

parallel using custom in-house scripts to deplete host reads, map to the SARS-CoV-2 Madison

107

reference (Genbank: MT039887.1; originally sequenced by the US Centers for Disease Control

108

and Prevention), and call minor variants ≥10% and ≥1% for ONT and Illumina datasets,

109

respectively. We detect no consensus-changing SNVs through two passages on Vero 76 cells

110

and through one passage on Vero E6 and Vero STAT-1 KO cells (passage 2 samples were not

111

available in these cell lines) (Fig 2a).

112

Interestingly, in comparison to the sequence derived from the first case of SARS-CoV-2

113

(MN908947.3), the Madison patient’s virus contained an in-frame deletion at nucleotide

114

positions 20,298 - 20,300 (Fig 2b). This deletion has not been identified in any other samples

115

submitted to GISAID as of April 8, 2020. This deletion occurs in a region that codes for the

116

poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease, but its functional impact is not clear [12].

117

No deletion in spike gene after passaging in cell culture

To understand how serial passaging SARS-CoV-2 affects genomic variation, we sequenced

to characterize the original biological specimen. Passaged sample names and cell lines are

123

sequences, bioinformatically deplete host reads, and generate alignment files, which contained

124

all reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 Madison reference genome (MT039887.1). At the

125

consensus level, SARS-CoV-2 does not accumulate genetic variation after two passages on

126

Vero 76 cells (Fig 2). We also examined deletions ≥1% frequency and ≥3 nt in length. We found

127

no evidence of deletions that fit these criteria in any of the cell culture isolates.

128

Most minor variants are found in the largest genes – ORF1a and ORF1b

129

To characterize patterns of sub-consensus diversity, we looked at SNVs at or above 1%

130

frequency in only the Illumina reads. We previously established that this conservative cutoff

131

ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered [15, 16]. All minor variant analyses and

132

figures were completed using the Illumina SNV data as these data are higher average quality

133

and ideal for analysis involving low-frequency variants (Fig 3). Seventy-five percent of all minor

134

variants we identify fall in ORF1a and ORF1b, which together take up 72.8% of the length of the

135

28kb coding genome. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the replicase machinery [7]. We account for

136

differences in gene size by normalizing variants to kilobase gene length (variants / kb-gene-

137

length – “v/kbgl”) [10]. The highest density of variants was reported in smaller genes like

138

envelope, ORF7a, and ORF10 (S2 Table). We also show that through each passage, variant

139

density in ORF1a and ORF1b increases. There were no SNVs ≥1% in the spike gene in the

140

primary NP swab, but low-frequency SNVs (all <5%) were identified in spike following passage

141

in cell culture (Fig 3). Outside of ORF1a and ORF1b, the other genes in the primary NP swab

A few SNVs at intermediate frequencies or identified across multiple samples stood out. A

synonymous SNV at nucleotide position 11,070 (ORF1a_11070_syn) was found at ≥15%

frequency in the primary NP swab as well as in all passaged samples. Amino acid positions

147

3,570 - 3,859 in ORF1a are predicted to be involved in the formation of double-membraned

vesicles [7]. Variants at nucleotide positions 127 (nonsynonymous – asparagine to aspartic acid;

149

ORF7a_127_N43D) and 129 (synonymous; ORF7a_129_syn) were identified between 1-4%

150

frequency in all passaged samples, but were not detected in the primary NP swab. ORF7a has

151

no known function, so the impact of these SNVs is unclear [7]. These SNVs

(p2a Vero 76 and p2b Vero 76) and ORFb_5843_T1948I (p2b Vero 76).

171

SNV frequency spectra reveal an excess of low-frequency SNVs

172

Purifying selection is known to remove new variants from the population, generating an excess

173

of low-frequency variants, while positive and/or diversifying selection promotes the accumulation

174

of intermediate- and high-frequency variation [17]. Especially in the setting of an acute viral

175

infection, exponential population growth can also result in an excess of low-frequency variants.

176

Population bottlenecks, for example sharp reductions in a viral population size typically

177

associated with airborne viral transmission, can contribute to an excess of intermediate- and

178

high-frequency variation. We generated site frequency spectra to expand our assessment of the

179

evolutionary pressures impacting SARS-CoV-2 viruses within humans and in cell culture. A

180

“neutral model” (assumes a constant population size and the absence of selection), represented

181

in light grey in Fig 4, predicts around 50% of polymorphisms will be low-frequency (1-10%). In

182

stark contrast to the neutral expectation, we observed ≥80% of SNVs falling into the low-

183

frequency bin in the primary nasal swab sample as well as passaged samples. This dramatic

184

excess of low-frequency variation is consistent with purifying selection acting to purge new,

185

deleterious mutations. This signature is also consistent with population expansion as is

186

expected in humans following airborne transmission and in cell culture after each passage.

187

Nucleotide diversity patterns point toward mild purifying selection

188

In addition to assessing the fate of individual minor variants, we were also interested in

189

evaluating population dynamics using diversity metrics. Specifically, we calculated genewise

190

diversity using π, the average number of pairwise differences per nucleotide site among a set of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051011; this version posted April 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

191

sequences, for each gene in each sample. Overall, genewise nucleotide diversity is very low

192

compared to other RNA viruses, consistent with low mutation rates in coronaviruses due to RNA

193

proofreading machinery [18, 19]. Genewise diversity was very low in the primary NP swab and

194

was only measurable in ORF1a (9 SNVs), ORF1b (5 SNVs) and N (1 SNV). Genewise diversity

195

is more varied in the passaged samples (Fig 5). Interestingly, π is highest in ORF7a in these

196

samples – although this signal seems to be primarily driven by the small size of this gene. To

197

more directly assess whether SARS-CoV-2 viruses are under selective pressure in the human

198

infection evaluated here and in cell culture, we also compared the relative abundance of

199

nonsynonymous (πN) and synonymous (πS) polymorphisms in each gene, which is a common

200

measure for selection that is also robust to variability in sequencing coverage depth [20]. The

201

dominant genetic signature when looking across the entire genome is one of purifying selection

202

(πN/πS < 1). In ORF1a, πS > πN in the primary NP swab as well as p1 and p2 samples. In

203

ORF1b, πN/πS is close to 1 in the primary NP swab and the p1 on Vero 76 and Vero E6 cells,

204

suggesting a more prominent role of genetic drift in this gene. Interestingly, πN/πS >> 1 in p1

205

Vero 76 ORF10, p1 Vero E6 envelope (E), and p1 Vero STAT-1 KO ORF3a.

206

Comparison of Illumina and ONT ability to capture minor variant frequencies

207

We examined the concordance between SNV calls at the same sites, irrespective of frequency,

208

determined by Illumina and ONT workflows. To begin, we used a stringent cutoff of 10%

209

frequency for ONT SNVs. We then called variants at percentage frequencies decreasing by

210

0.5% (eg. calling 8% variants, then 7.5%, etc) until the variants called by ONT no longer

211

matched Illumina variants irrespective of frequency at these sites (Fig 6, S1 Table.). We found

212

that for the primary NP swab we were able to call minor variants that occurred at ≥8%

213

frequency. Below 8% frequency, SNVs called by ONT were no longer exactly concordant with

214

SNVs called by Illumina. Discrepancies between ONT and Illumina variant calls at low

215

frequencies are tied to ONT’s high false discovery rate, a finding previously documented by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051011; this version posted April 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

216

Grubaugh and colleagues in 2019 [21]. For the p1 samples, ONT was able to capture variants

217

that occurred at ≥4.5% frequency. For the p2 samples, we called SNVs down to 8.5% and 5.5%

218

for the p2a and p2b samples, respectively. We likely observed concordant SNV calls between

219

Illumina and ONT at lower frequencies in the passaged samples because viral titer in vitro

220

typically exceeds viral titer in vivo resulting in higher average coverage in the passaged samples

221

required to support minor variant calls at lower frequencies.

222

Discussion

223

Minor variants are critical for addressing molecular evolution questions, identifying selective

224

pressures imposed by vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral therapeutics, and characterizing

225

interhost dynamics, including the stringency and character of transmission bottlenecks. Parallel

226

consensus-level data of clinical isolates are similarly important and allow us to predict

227

transmission patterns on a global, regional, and community-wide scale. Here, we explore

228

SARS-CoV-2 intrahost variation from a primary NP swab as well as from viruses passaged on

229

three distinct Vero cell lines. We show that while diversity is low overall, the dominant viral

230

genetic signature is one of mild purifying selection, evidenced by an excess of low-frequency

231

variants and the observation that πN/πS < 1 in most genes across all samples evaluated.

232

We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial

233

passages on Vero 76 cells even in the presence of a three nucleotide deletion in the region of

234

the genome encoding the poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be

235

propagated in cell culture in preparation for in vitro and in vivo studies without dramatic

236

alterations of its genotype. A recent paper by Duggal et al. illustrate the importance of viral

237

genotype instability in Zika virus (ZIKV) by describing variants enriched during cell culture

238

passage (Envelope-330L/NS1-98G), despite being attenuated in vivo and responsible for a less

239

pathogenic phenotype in mice compared to the wildtype genotype (Envelope-330V/NS1-98W)

240

[22]. Viral genotype instability in cell culture can significantly affect animal model development

241

and vaccine efficacy studies.

242

Though we do detect a handful of minor variants in ORF1a and ORF1b in the primary NP swab,

243

it is notable that eight out of eleven genes are clonal above the 1% frequency level. As natural

244

selection can only act upon genetic variation already existing within a population, very limited

245

intrahost genetic diversity suggests the pace of SARS-CoV-2 evolution may be primarily limited

246

by the generation of de novo variants. It is unclear at this time the degree to which limited

247

within-host viral diversity is linked to coronavirus biology – e.g. RNA proofreading capabilities,

248

homologous recombination allowing for the decoupling of deleterious “hitchhiker” mutations, and

249

a comparatively low mutation rate. Studies have estimated the mutation rate of coronaviruses

250

to be 2 × 10−6 mutations per site per round of replication, which is in line with other

251

coronaviruses [18], but lower than influenza, 7.1 × 10−6 − 4.5 × 10−5 mutations per site per round

252

of replication, another respiratory RNA virus [23–27].

253

A previous study claimed that a common deletion at nt position 23,585–23,599 (spike),

254

encoding QTQTN, arises after two passages in Vero E6 cells [12]. We did not identify similar

255

deletions in this region in any of our passaged samples, suggesting this deletion is not as

256

common as previously suggested. Interestingly, the primary NP swab obtained from the

257

Madison patient on the day of diagnosis contained an in-frame deletion at nucleotide positions

258

20,298 - 20,300 (ORF1ab) that was retained through two passages on Vero 76 cells. These

259

genomic deletions highlight the importance of characterizing viral stocks by deep-sequencing so

260

genotypic differences that may alter experimental outcomes can be thoroughly documented and

261

shared with other researchers.

262

Below the consensus level, we found an excess of low-frequency variants compared to what

263

would be expected in a neutral setting with no changes in population size and no selective

264

pressures at play. This suggests that either purifying selection is acting to remove new, mildly

265

deleterious mutations in hosts and in culture before they can reach intermediate or high

266

frequencies, and/or the virus is undergoing exponential population growth as would be expected

267

in an acute viral infection or following passage in cell culture. It is likely that viral exponential

268

population growth is contributing to this genetic signature; however, without additional samples,

269

it is difficult to determine the relative contribution of each of these factors. We would emphasize

270

these findings are rooted in relatively few, low-frequency SNVs from a single time point so

271

conclusions about the overall evolution of SARS-CoV-2 are necessarily limited. Continued deep

272

sequencing and analyses of SARS-CoV-2 minor variant SNV populations in humans and in cell

273

culture are critical.

Methods

276

Sample collection and cell culture passage conditions

277

Three different Vero cell lines were purchased from ATCC; Vero 76 (ATCC: CRL-1587), Vero

278

C1008 (ATCC: CRL-1586), Vero STAT-1 KO (ATCC: CCL-81-VHG), and were grown in

279

Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and L-

280

glutamine at 37oC with 5% CO2.

281

For the initial infection, the original clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) swab was divided evenly

282

between three TC25 cm2 flasks seeded the day before with 1 x 106 cells per flask; one flask for

283

each Vero cell line. Virus in the original clinical sample was layered onto the cells for one hour

284

at 37oC, the flasks were washed once with MEM, and the medium was replaced with fresh MEM

285

supplemented with 2% FBS. For each additional passage, cells were seeded in 75 cm2 flasks

286

the day before infection with 4 x 106 cells per flask and infected at a multiplicity of infection

287

between 0.01-0.001. For each passage, the virus was harvested when cell death was observed

288

to be around 80% (~4-5 days after infection).

289

Work with live virus was performed at biosafety level-3 containment at the Influenza Research

290

Institute at the University of Wisconsin – Madison under a recombinant DNA protocol approved

291

by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Approval to obtain the de-identified clinical sample was

292

reviewed by the Human Subjects Institutional Review Boards at the University of Wisconsin –

293

Madison.

294

Nucleic acid extraction

295

For each sample, approximately 140 µL of viral transport medium or cell culture supernatant

296

was passed through a 0.22µm filter (Dot Scientific, Burton, MI, USA). Total nucleic acid was

297

extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), substituting

298

carrier RNA with linear polyacrylamide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and eluting in 30 µL of

299

nuclease free H2O.

300

Waltham, MA, USA) at 37°C for 30 min and concentrated to 8µL using the RNA Clean &

301

Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Full protocol for nucleic acid extraction

302

and subsequent cDNA generation is available at https://www.protocols.io/view/sequence-

303

independent-single-primer-amplification-o-bckxiuxn.

304

Complementary DNA (cDNA) generation

305

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a modified Sequence Independent Single

306

Primer Amplification (SISPA) approach described by Kafetzopoulou et al. [14]. RNA was

307

reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)

308

using Primer A (5'-GTT TCC CAC TGG AGG ATA-(N9)-3'). Reaction conditions were as follows:

309

1µL of primer A was added to 4 µL of sample RNA, heated to 65°C for 5 minutes, then cooled to

310

4  for 5 minutes. Then 5 µL of a master mix (2 μL 5x RT buffer, 1 μL 10 mM dNTP, 1 μL

Samples were treated with TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

311

nuclease free H2O, 0.5 μL 0.1M DTT, and 0.5 μL SSIV RT) was added and incubated at 42 for

312

10 minutes. For generation of second strand cDNA, 5 µL of Sequenase reaction mix (1 μL 5x

313

Sequenase reaction buffer, 3.85 μL nuclease free H2O, 0.15 μL Sequenase enzyme) was added

314

to the reaction mix and incubated at 37°C for 8 minutes. This was followed by the addition of a

315

secondary Sequenase reaction mix (0.45 μl Sequenase Dilution Buffer, 0.15 μl Sequenase

316

Enzyme), and another incubation at 37 for 8 minutes. Following incubation, 1µL of RNase H

317

(New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was added to the reaction and incubated at 37°C for

318

20 min. Conditions for amplifying Primer-A labeled cDNA were as follows: 5 µL of primer-A

319

labeled cDNA was added to 45 µL of AccuTaq master mix per sample (5 µL AccuTaq LA 10x

320

Buffer, 2.5 µL dNTP mix, 1µL DMSO, 0.5 µL AccuTaq LA DNA Polymerase, 35 µL nuclease

321

free water, and 1 µL Primer B (5′-GTT TCC CAC TGG AGG ATA-3′). Reaction conditions for the

322

PCR were: 98°C for 30s, 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 50°C for 20 s, and 68°C for 2 min, followed

323

by 68°C for 10 min.

324

Oxford nanopore library preparation and sequencing

325

Amplified cDNA was purified using a 1:1 concentration of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter,

326

Brea, CA, USA) and eluted in 48µL of water. A maximum of 1 µg of DNA was used as input into

327

Oxford Nanopore kits SQK-LSK109. Samples were barcoded using the Oxford Nanopore Native

328

Barcodes (EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114), and pooled to a total of 140ng prior to being run

329

on the appropriate flow cell (FLO-MIN106) using the 72hr run script.

330

Nextera XT Illumina library preparation and sequencing

331

Amplified cDNA was purified using a 1:1 concentration of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter,

332

Brea, CA, USA) and eluted in 48µL of water. PCR products were quantified using Qubit dsDNA

333

high-sensitivity kit (Invitrogen, USA) and were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 ng/µl (1 ng

334

in 5 µl volume). Each sample was then made compatible for deep sequencing using the Nextera

335

XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA). Specifically, each sample was enzymatically

336

fragmented and tagged with short oligonucleotide adapters, followed by 14 cycles of PCR for

337

template indexing. Samples were purified using two consecutive AMPure bead cleanups (0.5x

338

and 0.7x) and were quantified once more using Qubit dsDNA high-sensitivity kit (Invitrogen,

339

USA). The average sample fragment length and purity was determined using Agilent High

340

Sensitivity DNA kit and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). After passing

341

quality control measures, samples were pooled equimolarly to a final concentration of 4 nM, and

342

5 µl of each 4 nM pool was denatured in 5 µl of 0.2 N NaOH for 5 min. Four samples (primary

343

NP swab, p1 Vero 76, p1 Vero E6, and p1 Vero STAT-1 KO) were pooled on a single flowcell to

344

a final concentration of 8pM with a PhiX-derived control library accounting for 1% of total DNA

345

and was loaded onto a 500-cycle v2 flowcell. The p2 samples (p2a Vero 76 and p2b Vero 76)

346

were pooled with seven other samples (not included in this manuscript) and were denatured to a

347

final concentration of 14pM with a PhiX-derived control library accounting for 1% of total DNA

348

and was loaded onto a 600-cycle v3 flowcell. Average quality metrics were recorded, reads

349

were demultiplexed, and FASTQ files were generated on Illumina’s BaseSpace platform.

350

Sequence read mapping and variant calling by ONT

351

Seventy-two hours after sequencing was initiated, raw sequencing reads were demultiplexed

352

using qcat (https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat).

353

sequencing reads are mapped against host genome and transcript references, and unmapped

354

reads are saved. Reads were then trimmed by 30bp on each side to discard SISPA primer

355

sequences. In this step, reads with quality scores ≤ 7 were discarded. Cleaned viral reads were

356

then mapped to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-

357

WI1/2020 consensus sequence (Genbank: MT039887.1, originally sequenced by the CDC)

358

using minimap2. Minor variants from ONT sequences that comprise at least 10% of total

359

sequences in any of the samples were identified using the bbmap callvariants.sh tool

In order to deplete host sequences,

Illumina sequence data analysis – quality filtering and variant calling

363

FASTQ files were initially processed using custom bioinformatic pipelines, available with

364

instructions

365

https://github.com/katarinabraun/SARSCoV2_passage_MS. Briefly, read ends were trimmed to

366

achieve an average read quality score of Q30 and a minimum read length of 100 bases using

367

Trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) [28]. Paired-end reads were

368

merged and then mapped to the reference sequence (Genbank MT039887.1: 2019-nCoV/USA-

369

WI1/2020) using Bowtie2 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml).

370

nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called with Varscan2 (http://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-

371

varscan.html) using a frequency threshold of 1%, a minimum coverage of 100 reads, and a

372

base quality threshold of Q30 or higher [29]. SNVs were annotated to determine the impact of

373

each variant on the amino acid sequence. SNVs were annotated in eleven open reading frames:

374

ORF1a (open reading frame 1a), ORF1b (open reading frame 1b), S (Spike, encodes surface

375

protein), ORF3a (open reading frame 3a), E (envelope), M (membrane), ORF6 (open reading

376

frame 6), ORF7a (open reading frame 7a), ORF8 (open reading frame 8), N (nucleocapsid),

377

ORF10 (open reading frame 10). VCF files were cleaned for additional analyses and figure-

378

generation using custom Python scripts, which are all available at the GitHub repository

379

accompanying this manuscript.

Nucleotide diversity was calculated using π summary statistics. π quantifies the average

382

number of pairwise differences per nucleotide site among a set of sequences and was

SNPGenie adapts the Nei and Gojobori method of estimating nucleotide diversity (π), and its

385

synonymous (πS) and nonsynonymous (πN) partitions from next-generation sequencing data

386

[31]. As most random nonsynonymous mutations are likely to be disadvantageous, we expect

387

πN = πS indicates neutrality suggesting that allele frequencies are determined primarily by

388

genetic drift. πN < πS indicates purifying selection is acting to remove new deleterious

389

mutations, and πN > πS indicates diversifying selection is favoring new mutations and may

390

indicate positive selection is acting to preserve multiple amino acid changes [32].
