Abstract
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emphasized the urgency to develop effective therapeutics. Drug
repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of
such therapeutics. The 3C like protease (3CLpro), or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug
target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays an essential role in viral replication. We performed a
quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and
investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay. Twenty-three small
molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 μM.
Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 µM), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 µM), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.5 µM), ZDEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 µM), LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 µM), and Z-FA-FMK (IC50 = 11.39 µM) are the most
potent 3CLpro inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23
compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro inhibitors that may have potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug combination therapies
to treating COVID-19 patients, and as starting points for chemistry optimization for new drug development.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic since the first case was found
in late 2019 in China. The causative virus was shortly confirmed as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a positive-sense single RNA virus consisting of four structural
proteins and an RNA genome. Upon entering the host cell, the viral genome is translated to yield two
overlapping polyproteins-pp1a and pp1ab

1, 2

. 3CL protease (3CLpro, also known as main protease) of the

related virus is excised from the polyproteins by its own proteolytic activity 3, and subsequently work
together with papain-like protease to cleave the polyproteins to generate total 16 functional non-structural
proteins (nsps). It was reported that the 3CLpro of SARS specifically operates at 11 cleavage sites on the
large polyprotein 1ab (790 kDa) 3, and no human protease has been found to share similar cleavage
specificity 4. The cleaved nsps play essential roles in assembling the viral replication transcription complex
(RTC) to initiate the viral replication. Although vaccine development is critically important for COVID19, effective small molecule antiviral drugs are urgently needed. Because of its essential role and no human
homolog, 3CLpro is one of the most intriguing drug targets for antiviral drug development 4, 5. The inhibitors
of 3CLpro are most likely less-toxic to host cells 4.
Viral protease has been investigated as a drug target for decades resulting in several approved drugs for
human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) 6. Saquinavir was the first approved
protease inhibitor for HIV, which started an era for this new class of antiviral drugs with the approval in
1995 6. Saquinavir contains a hydroxyethylene bond, which functions as a peptidomimetic scaffold to block
the catalytic function of the protease. Some of other approved protease inhibitors for HIV, such as ritonavir,
nelfinavir, indinavir, lopinavir, amprenavir, atazanavir, fosamprenavir, and darunavir, share the similar
inhibition mechanism with saquinavir 6. In addition to HIV, another group of approved viral protease
inhibitors is used for treating HCV. Although the structure of HCV is different compared to HIV, the same
function in cleaving viral precursor proteins renders the HCV protease a valid target for antiviral drug
development. Asunaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir, vaniprevir, telaprevir, and grazoprevir, etc.

have been approved by FDA for treatment of HCV 6. Regarding the coronavirus, the effort to target the
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro has identified several drug candidates 7. However, to date, no 3CLpro
inhibitor has been specifically approved for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, we have employed a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay that uses a self-quenched fluorogenic peptide
substrate for a quantitative high throughput screen (qHTS)

8

of 10,755 compounds including approved

drugs, clinically investigated drug candidates, and bioactive compounds. We report here the identification
of 23 3CLpro inhibitors with the IC50 ranging from 0.3 to 30 μM. The results from this study can contribute
to the design of the synergistic drug combinations for treatment of COVID-19 as well as new starting points
for lead optimization of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.

Results
Optimization of enzyme and substrate concentrations for 3CLpro enzyme assay
To carry out a qHTS of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, a fluorogenic protease enzyme assay was used and
optimized. As illustrated in Figure 1, the C-terminal of a peptide substrate links to a fluorophore (Edans)
and the N-terminal has a fluorescence quencher (Dabcyl) that quenches the fluorescence signal of Edans.
When the 3CLpro hydrolyzes the substrate to yield two fragments, Dabcyl is separated with Edans, which
relieves the fluorescence quenching effect resulting in an increase of fluorescence signal.
To optimize the assay conditions, different enzyme concentrations were first examined in this enzyme assay
at 20 µM substrate concentration in a 384-well plate (Figure 2a). The signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio increased
with the incubation times for all 3 enzyme concentrations tested (Figure 2b). The 120 min incubation
resulted in S/B ratios of 2.4, 3.8, and 6.0-fold for enzyme concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 nM, respectively.
We selected 50 nM enzyme concentration as an optimized condition for subsequent experiments.

Enzyme kinetic study was then conducted to determine the Km and Vmax of this viral protease. Substrate
concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 160 µM were used in this experiment with a fixed 50 nM enzyme
(Figure 2c). The Km was 75.41 µM and the Vmax was 1392 RFU/min for this recombinant SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro. For a consideration of assay sensitivity, it is desirable to use the lowest enzyme concentration and
substrate concentration (ideally under Km value) that still yield reliable S/B ratio (assay window, usually
> 2-fold). Because inhibitors usually compete with substrates for binding to the free enzyme, a high
substrate concentration can reduce potencies (IC50s) of inhibitors determined in enzyme assays 9. Thus, 50
nM 3CLpro and 20 µM substrate were selected as the optimized conditions for qHTS. We also found that
the assay performance at 37 °C was similar to that at RT. Therefore, the subsequent compound screens were
conducted at RT (Figure 2d).
Validation of 3CLpro enzyme assay with a known protease inhibitor and measurements of HTS assay
parameters
To validate the enzyme assay, a known SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376 10, was evaluated in 1536well plate format. GC376 concentration-dependently inhibited the enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
with an IC50 value of 0.17 µM. The highest tested concentration of GC376 (57.5 μM) exhibited a complete
inhibition, where the fluorescent intensity was equal to the background substrate in the absence of enzyme.
This IC50 value of GC376 is comparable to the reported value 10, indicating the reliability of this enzymatic
assay (Figure 3a).
Since DMSO is the solvent for all compounds in our compound libraries, we tested a DMSO plate in 1536well plate for the assessment of HTS assay parameters. A S/B ratio of 3.47-fold, a coefficient of variation
(CV) of 4.9% and a Z’ factor of 0.71 were obtained in the 1536-well DMSO plate test, indicating this
enzyme assay is robust for HTS (Figure 3b).

A primary screen of 10,755 compounds in the libraries containing approved drugs, investigational drug
candidates, and bioactive compounds yielded 161 hits in which the hit rate was 1.5 % (Figure S1). Since
the primary screen was done in four compound concentrations, compounds in dose-response curve classes
1-3 were selected as hits from the primary screen

8, 11

. These primary hits were then “cherry-picked” for

confirmation test in the same enzyme assay. Hit confirmation was performed at 11 compound
concentrations at 1:3 titration. The confirmed hits were selected using a cutoff of maximal inhibition greater
than 60 % and IC50 less than 30 µM. The results of primary screening and hit confirmation have been
uploaded into the NCATS Open Data Portal for public access 12.
Because this SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay is a fluorogenic assay, compounds with fluorescence quenching
properties can suppress the fluorescence signal generated by the protease activity. To eliminate the false
positives, we conducted a counter screen to identify compounds that quench the fluorescence of
SGFRKME-Edans, the product of the 3CLpro enzyme reaction, in the absence of the protease enzyme. Based
on the standard curve (Figure S2), the 3CLpro assay conditions generated signals that matched 2.085 μM of
Edans fragment. Results indicated that 23 compound showed relatively negligible fluorescence quenching
effect (Table 1). The concentration response curves of 6 most potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro are
shown in Figure 4.
Confirmation of antiviral activity of 3CLpro inhibitors in a SARS-CoV-2 live virus assay
To evaluate the antiviral effect of these 3CLpro inhibitors against infections of SARS-CoV-2 virus, we tested
the confirmed inhibitors in a cytopathic effect (CPE assay). Amongst the 6 most potent compounds in the
3CLpro enzyme assay (Figure 4), walrycin B and Z-FA-FMK showed the rescue of SARS-CoV-2 induced
CPE with the efficacies of 51.43% and 104.84%, respectively. The protease inhibitor Z-FA-FMK inhibited
viral CPE with an EC50 of 0.13 μM, with no apparent cytotoxicity. Hydroxocobalamin, suramin sodium,
and Z-DEVP-FMK were neither effective in CPE assay, nor cytotoxic to Vero E6 cells. Walrycin B and
LLL-2 showed apparent toxicity with CC50 values of 4.25 µM and 1.77 μM, and full cytotoxicity levels.

For other compounds identified, DA-3003-1, MG-115, TBB, MK0983, and Penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose
hydrate exhibited CPE activity as well (Table 1 and Figure S3).
In addition, 9 compounds with partial quenching effect rescued cells from SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5 and
Table 2). In these compounds, anacardic acid and AMG-837 showed the best rescue effect with the efficacy
of 89.62% and 106.31%, respectively. Meanwhile, all of these compounds showed more or less cytotoxicity
that renders an uncertainty of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in cells. The response curves for other
compounds with quenching effects can be found in Figure S4.
Interestingly, there was poor correlation between the 3CLpro enzyme and CPE assays. This could be due to
cytotoxicity of compounds obscuring CPE effects in live cells. The reason for weak potencies of these
compounds in the CPE assay than in the 3CLpro enzyme assay could be caused by unoptimized drug
properties such as poor cell membrane permeability of compounds. Conversely, some compounds, such as
Z-FA-FMK, exhibited more potent activities in the CPE assay than these in the 3CLpro enzyme assay that
may be due to polypharmacology (i.e. targeting multiple steps in viral replication process).
Modeling analysis
We docked the identified compounds to the active site of 3CLpro to further investigate their potential binding
to the protease target. The peptide-like inhibitors Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-FA-FMK fit well in the active site
of 3CLpro by forming a covalent bond between the keto and the catalytic residue Cys145, while the side
groups were orientated to the S1, S2 and S4 pocket (Figure 6). Small molecule inhibitors like Walrycin B
and LLL-12 were found to bind to the S1 or S1’ pocket near Cys145, but no specific binding interactions
were observed. Most of other compounds such as Suramin sodium and Hydroxocobalamin did not dock in
the active site of 3CLpro and appeared not to be protease inhibitors.

Viral protease is a valid antiviral drug target for RNA viruses including coronaviruses 13. In response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, great efforts have been made to evaluate the possibility of repurposing approved
viral protease inhibitor drugs for the clinical treatment of the disease. Unfortunately, the combination of
lopinavir and ritonavir, both approved HIV protease inhibitors, failed in a clinical trial without showing
benefit compared to the standard of care 14. To address this unmet need, several virtual screens and a drug
repurposing screen were performed to identify SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Ma et al. screened a focused
collections of protease inhibitors using an enzyme assay and identified Boceprevir, GC376, and three
calpain/cathepsin inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors 10. Amongst them, Boceprevir, an
FDA-approved HCV drug, not only showed the inhibition of 3CLpro with an IC50 of 4.13 μM, but also has
an EC50 of 1.90 μM against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the CPE assay 10. Lopinavir and ritonavir did
not show inhibition to 3CLpro in the study that indicated both of them have weak inhibitory activity against
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
In the virtual screen efforts, novel compounds were designed and synthesized by analyzing the substratebinding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The two lead compounds, 11a and 11b, designed by Dai et al.
presented high potency in both enzyme inhibition and anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity 15. In another
more comprehensive study, Jin et al. identified six compounds that have IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to
21.4 µM against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by applying structure-assisted drug design and compound library
repurposing screen 2.
In our qHTS of 10,755 compounds using the 3CLpro enzyme assay, we identified 27 compounds that
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzymatic activity. Among the most potent compounds(Figure 4), walrycin
B (IC50 = 0.27 μM) is the most potent inhibitor found in this screen. Walrycin B is an analog of toxoflavin
(a phytotoxin from Burkholderia glumae) with potent activity of inhibiting bacteria growth. It was named
as Walrycin B because it was found to inhibit the WalR activity in bacteria
component signal transduction system is essential for bacteria cell viability.

Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic vitamin B12 (cobalamin) that is used in the clinics via intravenous
administration. The antiviral effect of Vitamin B12 on HIV and HCV was reported previously. It was
reported that Vitamin B12 inhibited the HIV integrase 17. Li et al. reported that Vitamin B12 inhibited the
HCV protein translation via the inhibition of HCV internal ribosome entry site

18

. We found that

hydroxocobalamin inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in this study.
Suramin is an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug for trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis and has to be given
by intravenous injection as it has poor bioavailability when being taken orally. The IC50 for inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is 6.5 μM, which is much lower than the reported human plasma concentration of 97
- 181 μM (126 – 235 μg/ml) 19. Suramin is an old drug with extensive polypharmacology 20. Broad antiviral
effects of suramin were reported including HIV, Dengue virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, Hepatitis B and C
viruses, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya virus, and Enterovirus 20. The antiviral activity of suramin may
be exerted through inhibiting viral entry and replication. Suramin can efficiently inhibit Chikungunya virus
and Ebola envelope-mediated gene transfer to host cells 21. Multiple studies have also revealed that suramin
interferes with viral RNA synthesis by targeting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

22, 23

. A recent

study by de Silva et al. proposed suramin might prevent SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells24. Different
from these previously reported various mechanisms of action, we found that suramin also targeted 3CLpro
enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, which is a new mechanism of action for this drug.
Another 3CLpro inhibitor identified is Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 μM). It is a cell permeable fluoromethyl
ketone (FMK)-derivatized peptide acting as an irreversible caspase 3 inhibitor. It has been extensively
studied as a neuroprotective agent as it inhibited caspase 3 induced apoptotic cell death in acute
neurodegeneration

25, 26

. Another similar peptide-like inhibitor Z-FA-FMK, a potent irreversible inhibitor

of cysteine proteases including caspase 3, was also identified to inhibit 3CLpro (IC50 = 11.39 μM). The
predicted binding models of these inhibitors to 3CLpro showed that they bound to the active site of 3CLpro
in the same manner as observed in other peptide-like 3CLpro inhibitors 2, suggesting that they share the
same mode of action for inhibition of 3CLpro activity.

LLL-12 inhibited the 3CLpro (IC50 = 9.84 μM) and it was originally generated by structure-based design
targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) for cancer therapy, where it
inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and induced apoptosis 27. Antiviral activity of LLL-12 has been reported
against HIV 28. The mechanism of action for its antiviral effect was unclear, though it suppressed HIV-1
infection in macrophages 28. In our current study, we found that LLL-12 inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
activity.
In conclusion, this study employed an enzymatic assay for qHTS that identified 23 SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
inhibitors from a collection of approved drugs, drug candidates, and bioactive compounds. These 3CLpro
inhibitors can be combined with drugs of different targets to evaluate their potential in drug cocktails for
the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, they can also serve as starting points for medicinal chemistry
optimization to improve potency and drug like properties.

3CLpro enzyme assay
The 3CLpro enzyme assay was developed in 384-well black, medium binding microplates (Greiner BioOne, Monroe, NC, USA) with a total volume of 20 µL and then miniaturized to 1536-well format. In 384well plate format, 10 µL enzyme in reaction buffer was added into each well, followed by the addition of
10 µL substrate. Fluorescent intensity was measured at different time points on a PHERAstar FSX plate
reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC, USA) with Ex=340 nm/Em=460 nm after the addition of substrate. The
experiment was conducted at both room temperature (RT) and 37 °C.
Steady-state kinetic parameters were evaluated using 50 nM 3CLpro and different concentrations of
substrate. In brief, 10 µL/well enzyme was added into 384-well plate. The reaction was then initialized by
adding the substrate solutions at different concentrations. The substrate stock solution was serially diluted
1:2 to obtain seven concentrations. The final concentrations used in this test were 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5,
and 2.5 µM. The fluorescent intensity was measured at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min.
Compound library screening, confirmation and counter screen
For the primary screen, library compounds were formatted in 1536-well plates with 4 compounds
concentrations at inter-plate titration of 1:5 with the highest concentration of 10 mM for most of compounds
in the libraries. The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay was initiated by dispensing 2 µL/well of 50 nM enzyme
solution into 1536 black bottom microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA) by a Multidrop Combi
disperser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), followed by pin transfer of 23 nL compounds

in DMSO solution using an automated pintool workstation (WAKO Scientific Solutions, San Diego, CA).
After 30 min incubation at RT, 2 µL/well 20 μM substrate solution was dispensed into the assay plates to
initiate the enzyme reaction. After 3 h incubation at RT, the plates were read at 460 nm emission upon
excitation at 340 nm.
Following primary screening, selected hit compounds were diluted with intraplate 11-point dilution at 1:3
ratio and tested using the same enzyme assay as the primary screen. Each compound was tested in three
biological replicates.
A counter-screen assay to eliminate the fluorescence quenching compounds was carried out by dispensing
4 μL of substrate containing fluorescent Edans fragment, SGFRKME-Edans, into 1536-well assay plates.
Compounds were pin transferred as 23 nL/well and the fluorescence signal was read.
SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay
SARS-CoV-2 CPE assay was conducted at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL) as described in
previous reports

30, 31

. In brief, high ACE2 expressing Vero E6 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2

(USA_WA1/2020) at 0.002 M.O.I. After infection of 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the cell viability was
examined with CellTiter-Glo ATP content assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). CPE raw data were
normalized to non-infected cells and virus infected cells only which were set as 100% efficacy and 0
efficacy, respectively. In addition, the compound cytotoxicity was evaluated in the same cells by measuring
ATP content in the absence of virus. Compound cytotoxicity raw data were normalized with wells
containing cells only as 100 % viability (0% cytotoxicity), and wells containing media only as 0% viability
(100% cytotoxicity).
Modeling
Modeling and docking studies were performed using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE)
program (Chemical Computing Group ULC, Montreal, QC, Canada). The crystal structure of 3CLpro in
complex with a peptide-like inhibitor N3 (PDB code 6LU7) 2 was used to dock inhibitors to the active site

of 3CLpro. The ligand induced fit docking protocol was used and the binding affinity was evaluated using
the GBVI/WSA score. Covalent docking was performed for inhibitors Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-FA-FMK,
with a covalent binding to residue Cyc145. Finally, energy minimization was performed to refine the
predicted binding complex.
Data analysis and statistics
The primary screen data was analyzed using a customized software developed in house at NCATS 29. Raw
data were normalized to relative controls, in which the DMSO alone was set as 0% inhibitory activity, the
reaction buffer containing substrate only was set as 100% inhibitory activity. Concentration-response
curves were fitted and IC50 values of confirmed compounds were calculated using the GraphPad Prism
software (San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the fluorogenic SARS-CoV-2 protease enzymatic assay. The peptide
substrate exhibits low fluorescent because the fluorescence intensity of Edans in the C-terminal is quenched
by the Dabcyl in the N-terminal of the substrate. The protease cleaves the substrate which breaks the
proximity of the quencher molecule Dabcyl with the fluorophore Edans, resulting in an increase in
fluorescence signal. This increase in fluorescence signal is proportional to the protease activity.
