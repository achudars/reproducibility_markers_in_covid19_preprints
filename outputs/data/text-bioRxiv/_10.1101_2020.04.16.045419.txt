ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global health
and economic crisis of unprecedented scale. The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a
lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development
of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies,
known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious
process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large
combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody
pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the
context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found
to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial
inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we
identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that
compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be
used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via
fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance
the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information
and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource.

INTRODUCTION
The ongoing pandemic arising from the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,
demands urgent development of effective antiviral therapeutics. Several factors contribute to the
adverse nature of SARS-CoV-2 from a global health perspective, including the absence of herd
immunity [1], high transmissibility [2, 3], the prospect of asymptomatic carriers [4], and a high rate of
clinically severe outcomes [5]. Moreover, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be available for
at least 12-18 months [6], despite earnest development efforts [7, 8], making alternative intervention
strategies paramount. In addition to offering relief for patients suffering from the resulting COVID-19
disease, therapeutics may also reduce the viral transmission rate by being administered to
asymptomatic individuals subsequent to probable exposure [9]. Finally, given that SARS-CoV-2
represents the third global coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years [10, 11], development of rapid
therapeutic strategies during the current crises could offer greater preparedness for future pandemics.
Akin to all coronaviruses, the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 harbors protruding, club-like, multidomain
spike proteins that provide the machinery enabling entry into human cells [12-14]. The spike
ectodomain is segregated into two regions, termed S1 and S2. The outer S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is
responsible for host recognition via interaction between its C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD)
and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), present on the exterior surface of airway cells
[14, 15]. While there is no known host-recognition role for the S1 N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARSCoV-2, it is notable that S1 NTDs of other coronaviruses have been shown to bind host surface glycans
[12, 16]. In contrast to spike region S1, the S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion apparatus, and
also mediates trimerization of the ectodomain [12-14]. Prior to host recognition, spike proteins exist
in a metastable pre-fusion state wherein the S1 subunits lay atop the S2 region and the RBD oscillates
between “up” and “down” conformations that are, respectively, accessible and inaccessible to
receptor binding [12, 17, 18]. Upon processing at the S1/S2 and S2' cleavage sites by host proteases as
well as engagement to the receptor, the S2 subunit undergoes dramatic conformational changes from
the pre-fusion to the post-fusion state. Such structural rearrangements are associated with the
merging of the viral envelope with host membranes, thereby allowing injection of the genetic
information into the cytoplasm of the host cell [19, 20].
Coronavirus spike proteins are highly immunogenic [21], and several experimental approaches have
sought to target this molecular feature for the purpose of viral neutralization [22]. The high specificity,
potency, and modular nature of antibody-based antiviral therapeutics has shown exceptional promise
[23-25], and the isolated, purified RBD has been a popular target for the development of anti-spike
antibodies against pathogenic coronaviruses [26-29]. However, binders against the isolated RBD may
not effectively engage the aforementioned pre-fusion conformation of the full spike, which could
account for the poor neutralization ability of recently described single-domain antibodies that were
raised against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 [30]. Therefore, to better identify molecules with qualities
befitting a drug-like candidate, it would be advantageous to validate RBD-specific binders in the
context of the full, stabilized, pre-fusion spike assembly [13, 31].
Single domain antibodies based on the variable VHH domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies of
camelids – generally known as nanobodies – have emerged as a broadly utilized and highly successful
antibody fragment format [32]. Nanobodies are small (12-15 kDa), stable, and inexpensive to produce
in bacteria and yeast [33], yet they bind targets in a similar affinity range as conventional antibodies.
Due to their minimal size, they are particularly suited to reach hidden epitopes such as crevices of

target proteins [34]. We recently designed three libraries of synthetic nanobodies, termed sybodies,
based on elucidated structures of nanobody-target complexes (Fig. 1A) [35, 36]. Sybodies can be
selected against any target protein within twelve working days, which is considerably faster than
natural nanobodies, which requires the repetitive immunization during a period of two months prior
to binder selection by phage display [36] (Fig. 1C). A considerable advantage of our platform is that
sybody selections are carried out under defined conditions — in case of coronavirus spike proteins,
this offers the opportunity to generate binders recognizing the metastable pre-fusion conformation
[13, 14]. Finally, due to the feasibility of inhaled therapeutic nanobody formulations [37], virusneutralizing sybodies could offer a convenient and direct means of prophylaxis.
Here, we report of in vitro selection and characterization of sybodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. Two independently prepared RBD constructs were used for in vitro sybody selections,
and resulting single clones that could bind the full spike ectodomain were sequenced, expressed, and
purified. Six unique sybodies show favorable binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, and five of these
were also found to substantially attenuate the interaction between the viral RBD and human ACE2.
Moreover, pairs of sybodies were identified that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. We present all
sequences for these clones, along with detailed protocols to enable the community to freely produce
and further characterize these SARS-CoV-2 binders.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Purification and biotinylation of target proteins
Based on sequence alignments with isolated RBD variants from SARS-CoV-1 that were amenable to
purification and crystallization [29, 38], a SARS-CoV-2 RBD construct was designed, consisting of
residues Pro330—Gly526 fused to Venus YFP (RBD-vYFP). This construct was expressed and secreted
from Expi293 cells, and RBD-vYFP was extracted directly from culture medium supernatant using an
immobilized anti-GFP nanobody [39], affording a highly purified product with negligible background
contamination. Initial efforts to cleave the C-terminal vYFP fusion partner with 3C protease resulted in
unstable RBD, so experiments were continued with full RBD-vYFP fusion protein. To account for the
presence of the vYFP fusion partner, a second RBD construct, consisting of a fusion to murine IgG1 Fc
domain (RBD-Fc), was commercially acquired. To remove any trace amines, buffers were exchanged
to PBS via extensive dialysis. Proteins were chemically biotinylated, and the degree of biotinylation
was assessed by a streptavidin gel-shift assay and found to be greater than 90 % of the target proteins
[40]. We note that while both RBD fusion proteins were well-behaved, a commercially acquired
purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain construct (ECD) was found to be aggregation-prone.
Very recently, we also produced an engineered spike protein ectodomain containing two point
mutations known to stabilize the pre-fusion state, an inactivated furin cleavage site, and a C-terminal
trimerization motif [13, 14, 31]. While this purified pre-fusion spike (PFS) had not yet been available
for binder selections and characterization by grating-coupled interferometry, it was used to conduct
ELISAs in order to identify selected sybodies which recognize the RBD in the pre-fusion context (see
below).

Sybody selections
Since both our RBD constructs bear additional fusion domains (Fc of mouse IgG1 and vYFP,
respectively), sybody selections were carried out with a “target swap” approach (Fig. 1B). Hence,
selections with the three sybody libraries (concave, loop and convex) were started with the RBD-vYFP
construct using ribosome display, and the RBD-Fc construct was then used for the two phage display
rounds (selection variant 1: RBD-vYFP/RBD-Fc/RBD-Fc) and vice versa (selection variant 2: RBD-Fc/RBDvYFP/RBD-vYFP). Accordingly, there were a total of six selection reactions (Table 1, Fig. 1B). To increase
the average affinity of the isolated sybodies, we included an off-rate selection step using the preenriched purified sybody pool after phage display round 1 as competitor. To this end, sybody pools of
all three libraries of the same selection variant were sub-cloned from the phage display vectors into
the sybody expression vector pSb_init. Subsequently, the two separate pools (all sybodies of selection
variants 1 and 2, respectively) were expressed and purified. The purified pools were then added to the
panning reactions of the respective selection variant in the second phage display round. Thereby, rebinding of sybody-phage complexes with fast off-rates was suppressed. Enrichment of sybodies against
the RBD was monitored by qPCR. Already in the first phage display round, the concave and loop
sybodies of selection variant 2 showed enrichment factors of 7 and 3, respectively (Table 1). After the
second phage display round (which included the off-rate selections step), strong enrichment factors in
the range of 10-263 were determined.

Sybody identification by ELISA
After sub-cloning the pools from the phage display vector pDX_init into the sybody expression vector
pSb_init, 47 clones of each of the 6 selections reactions (Table 1, Fig. 1B) were picked at random and
expressed in small scale. Our standard ELISA was initially performed using RBD-vYFP (RBD), spike
ectodomain containing S1 and S2 (ECD), and maltose binding protein (MBP) as unrelated dummy
protein. As outlined in the Materials and Methods section, ELISA analysis revealed very high hit rates
for the RBD and the ECD ranging from 81 % to 100 % and 66 % to 96 %, respectively (Fig. 2, Table 1).
The majority of the sybodies giving an ELISA signal to the RBD also gave a clear signal the full-length
spike protein (Fig. 2). However, there was a total of 44 hits that only gave an ELISA signal for RBD-vYFP,
but not for the ECD. This could be due to the presence of cryptic RBD epitopes that are not accessible
in the context of the full-length spike protein, or the respective sybodies may recognize the vYFP
portion of the RBD-vYFP construct, though the selection procedure clearly disfavors the latter
explanation. Importantly, background binding to the dummy protein MBP was not observed for any of
the analyzed sybodies, clearly showing that the binders are highly specific. We then sequenced 72
sybodies that were ELISA-positive against RBD-vYFP as well as the full-length spike (12 for each of the
6 selection reactions numbered from Sb#1-72, see also Fig. 1B).
Subsequent to sybody sequencing, we also performed the ELISA using engineered pre-fusion-stabilized
spike ectodomain (PFS) (Fig. 2), which was not available at the onset of the project. Overall, the ELISA
signals for the ECD and PFS are highly similar. However, there are around 40 sybodies that bind to the
ECD clearly stronger than to the PFS (yet the opposite scenario was never observed). This could be
explained by the fact that the PFS forms a trimer, while the oligomeric state of the ECD is not clear. In
addition, the ECD might adopt partially or completely a post-fusion state, whereas PFS is expected to
predominantly adopt the pre-fusion state. Trimer formation as well as pre-fusion stabilization might
shield certain binding epitopes on the RBD in the context of the PFS, which might become accessible

as the spike falls apart into monomers and/or transits to the post-fusion state. In light of our ELISA
data, the PFS construct will be a crucial element in any future sybody selection campaigns.

Sequence analysis
Sequencing results of 70 out of 72 sybody clones were unambiguous. Out of these 70 clones, 63 were
found to be unique and the respective clone names are indicated in the ELISA figure (Fig. 2, Table 2).
Of note, there were no duplicate binders identified in both selection variants, indicating that the two
separate selection streams gave rise to completely different arrays of sybodies. As an additional note,
one sybody identified from the supposed convex library turned out to belong to the concave library;
spill-over of sybodies across libraries is occasionally observed. Hence, there was a total of 23 concave,
22 loop and 18 convex sybodies, which were then aligned according to their library origin (Figs. 3-5).
As a final analysis, all sybody sequences were aligned to generate a phylogenetic tree, which shows a
clear segregation across the three libraries and indicates a large sequence variability of the identified
sybodies (Fig. 6).

Purification of sybodies and kinetic analysis of sybody interaction with SARS-CoV-2 proteins
The 63 unique sybodies were individually expressed in E. coli and purified via Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography and gel filtration. Ultimately, 57 sybodies were sufficiently well-behaved, with
respect to solubility, yield, and monodispersity, to proceed with further characterization. For a kinetic
analysis of sybody interactions with the viral spike, we employed grating-coupled interferometry (GCI)
to probe sybody binding to immobilized RBD-vYFP or ECD. First, the 57 purified sybodies were
subjected to an off-rate screen, which revealed six sybodies (Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, Sb#45, and
Sb#68) with strong binding signals and comparatively slow off-rates. Binding constants were then
determined by measuring on-and off-rates over a range of sybody concentrations, revealing affinities
within a range of 20–180 nM to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Fig. 7, Table 3). Of note, binding affinities were
consistently equal or higher for the ECD as compared to the RBD-vYFP, in particular in case of Sb#68
for which the off-rate differs by more than two-fold. This might indicate a binding avidity effect arising
from binding epitopes clustering in the context of the spike trimer or differences with regards to the
glycan structures (RBD-vYFP was produced in HEK cells, whereas the ECD was produced in insect cells).
To our surprise, the majority of purified and ELISA-positive sybodies (51 out of 57) displayed binding
affinities worse than 200 nM. This may be attributed to the presence of complex heterogeneous Asnlinked glycans within the RBD, which could hinder the isolation of specific high-affinity binders.
Alternatively, given that the final ELISA step of the selection process resulted in a substantial number
of positive clones, insufficiently stringent conditions may have favored the high positive hit rate of lowaffinity binders.

ACE2 competition analysis
Since virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the ability of the viral RBD to bind to human ACE2
(hACE2), we sought to determine which of the 57 selected sybodies that were well-behaved upon
purification could inhibit interaction between the isolated RBD and purified hACE2. For this
assessment, ELISA plates were coated with purified hACE2, and the binding of purified RBD to the

immobilized hACE2 was measured in the presence or absence of an excess of each purified sybody
(Fig. 8). While the absence of any added sybody resulted in a strong ELISA signal corresponding to RBD
association with hACE2, the pre-incubation of nearly all sybodies with the RBD resulted in an
attenuated signal, implying that these binders inhibit RBD-hACE2 association. This signal decrease
relative to unchallenged RBD was modest for most sybodies, with an average signal reduction of about
50%, but five sybodies demonstrated exceptionally high apparent inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction
(Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, and Sb#45), showing ≥90% signal reduction. Notably, the
aforementioned kinetic analysis had shown that these sybodies were also among the strongest RBD
binders. Taken together, this data suggests that Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, and Sb#45 recognize a
surface region on the RBD that overlaps with the hACE2 binding site.

Simultaneous binding of multiple sybodies to the RBD
While kinetic analysis had revealed Sb#68 to be among the stronger binders to the SARS-CoV-2
ectodomain (KD ≈ 37 nM, Fig. 7, Table 3), the hACE2 competition ELISA revealed that Sb#68 does not
inhibit hACE2-RBD interaction to the same extent as other sybodies with comparable affinities (65%
inhibition for Sb#68, compared to >90% for Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, and Sb#45). Therefore, it was
hypothesized that Sb#68 may interact with a non- or partially-overlapping surface on the RBD, relative
to the more strongly-inhibiting sybodies. Using Sb#15 as a representative of the hACE2-inhibiting
sybodies, we analyzed the ability of Sb#15 and Sb#68 to simultaneously associate with the RBD. First,
ELISA experiments demonstrate that incubation of Sb#68 with the pre-fusion spike only slightly
prevents the spike from binding to immobilized Sb#15, whereas pre-incubation with Sb#14, Sb#15,
Sb#16, Sb#42, or Sb#45 completely prevents spike interaction with immobilized Sb#15 (Fig. 9). In
agreement with the ELISA data, GCI experiments revealed that co-injection of Sb#15 and Sb#68 results
in a clear (but not fully additive) increase of the response signal, relative to Sb#15 or Sb#68 injected
alone, implying simultaneous binding of Sb#15 and Sb#68 (Fig. 9). The control GCI experiment involving
the co-injection of Sb#15 and Sb#45 did not result in a similar signal increase (Fig. 9). In sum, this data
plausibly suggests that Sb#15 and Sb#68 can simultaneously bind to the RBD. For the design of
therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, the fusion of such a pair of non-overlapping binders could provide
benefits via increased overall avidity to the spike protein.

Conclusion and outlook
We have demonstrated the ability of our rapid in vitro selection platform to generate sybodies against
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, within a two-week timeframe. Characterization of these sybodies has identified
a high-affinity subset of binders that also inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction. We anticipate that the
presented panel of anti-RBD sybodies could be of use in the design of urgently required therapeutics
to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the development of inhalable prophylactic
formulations [37]. Furthermore, our identification of a pair of sybodies that can simultaneously
associate with the RBD may offer an attractive foundation for the construction of a polyvalent sybodybased therapeutic. We have attempted to provide a complete account of the generation of these
molecules, including full sequences and detailed methods, such that other researchers may contribute
to their ongoing analysis. Future work may include virus neutralization assays using the identified
sybodies, as well as further selection campaigns targeting additional spike epitopes. Finally, our
recently described flycode technology could be utilized for deeper interrogation of selection pools, in

order to facilitate discovery of exceptional sybodies that possess very slow off-rates or recognize rare
epitopes [41].

METHODS
Cloning, expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
A gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 residues Pro330—Gly526 (RBD, GenBank accession QHD43416.1),
downstream from a modified N-terminal human serum albumin secretion signal [42], was chemically
synthesized (GeneUniversal). This gene was subcloned using FX technology [43] into a custom
mammalian expression vector [44], appending a C-terminal 3C protease cleavage site, myc tag, Venus
YFP[45], and streptavidin-binding peptide [46] onto the open reading frame (RBD-vYFP). 100–250 mL
of suspension-adapted Expi293 cells (Thermo) were transiently transfected using Expifectamine
according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo), and expression was continued for 4–5 days in a
humidified environment at 37°C, 8% CO2. Cells were pelleted (500g, 10 min), and culture supernatant
was filtered (0.2 µm mesh size) before being passed three times over a gravity column containing NHSagarose beads covalently coupled to the anti-GFP nanobody 3K1K [39], at a resin:culture ratio of 1ml
resin per 100ml expression culture. Resin was washed with 20 column-volumes of RBD buffer
(phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, supplemented with additional 0.2M NaCl), and RBD-vYFP was
eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, via sequential 0.5 ml fractions, without prolonged incubation of resin
with the acidic elution buffer. Fractionation tubes were pre-filled with 1/10 vol 1M Tris, pH 9.0 (50 µl),
such that elution fractions were immediately pH-neutralized. Fractions containing RBD-vYFP were
pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4°C. Purity was estimated to be >95%, based on SDS-PAGE (not
shown). Yield of RBD-vYFP was approximately 200–300 μg per 100 ml expression culture. A second
purified RBD construct, consisting of SARS-CoV-2 residues Arg319—Phe541 fused to a murine IgG1 Fc
domain (RBD-Fc) expressed in HEK293 cells, was purchased from Sino Biological (Catalogue number:
40592-V05H, 300 µg were ordered). Purified full-length spike ectodomain (ECD) comprising S1 and S2
(residues Val16—Pro1213) with a C-terminal His-tag and expressed in baculovirus-insect cells was
purchased from Sino Biological (Catalogue number: 40589-V08B1, 700 µg were ordered). The
prefusion ectodomain of the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein (residues 1-1208) [13], was transiently
transfected into 50x108 suspension-adapted ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Fisher) using 3 mg plasmid DNA
and 15 mg of PEI MAX (Polysciences) per 1L ProCHO5 medium (Lonza) in a 3L Erlenmeyer flask
(Corning) in an incubator shaker (Kühner). One hour post-transfection, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO;
AppliChem) was added to 2% (v/v). Incubation with agitation was continued at 31°C for 5 days. 1L of
filtered (0.22 um) cell culture supernatant was clarified. Then, a 1mL Gravity flow Strep-Tactin®XT
Superflow® column (iba lifescience) was rinsed with 2 ml buffer W (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA) using gravity flow. The supernatant was added to the column, which was then rinsed with
5 ml of buffer W (all with gravity flow). Finally, six elution steps were performed by adding each time
0.5 ml of buffer BXT (50mM Biotin in buffer W) to the resin. All purification steps were performed at
4°C.

Biotinylation of target proteins
To remove amines, all proteins were first extensively dialyzed against RBD buffer. Proteins were
concentrated to 25 µM using Amicon Ultra concentrator units with a molecular weight cutoff of 30 –
7

50 kDa. Subsequently, the proteins were chemically biotinylated for 30 min at 25°C using NHS-Biotin
(Thermo Fisher, #20217) added at a 10-fold molar excess over target protein. Immediately after, the
three samples were dialyzed against TBS pH 7.5. During these processes (first dialysis/ concentrating/
biotinylation/ second dialysis), 20 %, 30 %, 65 % and 44% of the RBD-vYFP, RBD-Fc, ECD and PFS
respectively were lost due to sticking to the concentrator filter or due to aggregation. Biotinylated
RBD-vYFP, RBD-Fc and ECD were diluted to 5 µM in TBS pH 7.5, 10 % glycerol and stored in small
aliquots at -80°C. Biotinylated PFS was stored at 4°C in TBS pH 7.5.

Sybody selections
Sybody selections with the three sybody libraries concave, loop and convex were carried out as
described in detail before [36]. In short, one round of ribosome display followed by two rounds of
phage display were carried out. Binders were selected against two different constructs of the SARSCoV-2 RBD; an RBD-vYFP fusion and an RBD-Fc fusion. MBP was used as background control to
determine the enrichment score by qPCR [36]. In order to avoid enrichment of binders against the
fusion proteins (YFP and Fc), we switched the two targets after ribosome display (Fig. 1B). For the offrate selections we did not use non-biotinylated target proteins as described in the standard protocol,
because we did not have enough purified protein at hand to do so. Instead we sub-cloned all three
libraries for both selections after the first round of phage display into the pSb_init vector (108 clones)
and expressed the six pools in E. coli MC1061 cells. Then the pools corresponding to the same selection
were pooled for purification. The two final pools were purified by Ni-NTA resin using gravity flow
columns, followed by buffer exchange of the main peak fraction using a desalting PD10 column in TBS
pH 7.5 to remove imidazole. The pools were eluted with 3.2 ml instead of 3.5 ml TBS pH 7.5 in order
to ensure complete buffer exchange. These two purified pools were used for the off-rate selection in
the second round of phage display at concentrations of approximately 390 µM for selection variant 1
(RBP-Fc) and 450 µM for selection variant 2 (RBP-YFP). The volume used for off-rate selection was 500
µl. Just before the pools were used for the off-rate selection, 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 was added
to each sample. Off-rate selections were performed for 3 minutes.

Sybody identification by ELISA
ELISAs were performed as described in detail before [36]. 47 single clones were analyzed for each
library of each selection. Since the RBD-Fc construct was incompatible with our ELISA format due to
the inclusion of Protein A to capture an α-myc antibody, ELISA was performed only for the RBD-vYFP
(50 nM) and the ECD (25 nM) and later on with the PFS (25 nM). Of note, the three targets were
analyzed in three separate ELISAs. As negative control to assess background binding of sybodies, we
used biotinylated MBP (50 nM). 72 positive ELISA hits were sequenced (Microsynth, Switzerland).

Expression and Purification of sybodies
The 63 unique sybodies were expressed and purified as described [36]. In short, all 63 sybodies were
expressed overnight in E.coli MC1061 cells in 50 ml cultures. The next day the sybodies were extracted
from the periplasm and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (batch binding) followed by sizeexclusion chromatography using a Sepax SRT-10C SEC100 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column

equilibrated in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (detergent was added for subsequent
kinetic measurements). Six out of the 63 binders (Sb#4, Sb#7, Sb#18, Sb#34, Sb#47, Sb#61) were
excluded from further analysis due to suboptimal behavior during SEC analysis (i.e. aggregation or
excessive column matrix interaction).

Grating-coupled interferometry (GCI)
Kinetic characterization of sybodies binding onto SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins was performed using GCI
on the WAVEsystem (Creoptix AG, Switzerland), a label-free biosensor. Biotinylated RBD-vYFP and ECD
were captured onto a Streptavidin PCP-STA WAVEchip (polycarboxylate quasi-planar surface; Creoptix
AG) to a density of 1300-1800 pg/mm2. Sybodies were first analyzed by an off-rate screen performed
at a concentration of 200 nM (data not shown) to identify binders with sufficiently high affinities. The
six sybodies Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, Sb#45, and Sb#68 were then injected at increasing
concentrations ranging from 1.37 nM to 1 μM (three-fold serial dilution, 7 concentrations) in TBS buffer
supplemented with 0.05 % Tween-20. Sybodies were injected for 120 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min per
channel and dissociation was set to 600 s to allow the return to baseline. Sensorgrams were recorded
at 25 °C and the data analyzed on the WAVEcontrol (Creoptix AG). Data were double-referenced by
subtracting the signals from blank injections and from the reference channel. A Langmuir 1:1 model
was used for data fitting.

ACE2 competition ELISA
Purified recombinant hACE2 protein (MyBioSource, Cat# MBS8248492) was diluted to 10 nM in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and 100 μl aliquots were incubated overnight on Nunc
MaxiSorp 96-well ELISA plates (ThermoFisher #44-2404-21) at 4°C. ELISA plates were washed three
times with 250 μl TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST). Plates were blocked with 250 μl of 0.5%
(w/v) BSA in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. 100 μl samples of biotinylated RBD-vYFP (25 nM) mixed
with individual purified sybodies (500 nM) were prepared in TBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.05%
(v/v) Tween-20 (TBS-BSA-T) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. These 100 μl RBD-sybody
mixtures were transferred to the plate and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. 100 μl of
streptavidin-peroxidase (Merck, Cat#S2438) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-BSA-T was incubated on the plate
for 1 h. Finally, to detect bound biotinylated RBD-vYFP, 100 μl of development reagent containing
3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), prepared as previously described [36], was added, color
development was quenched after 3-5 min via addition of 100 μl 0.2 M sulfuric acid, and absorbance at
405 nm was measured. Background-subtracted absorbance values were normalized to the signal
corresponding to RBD-vYFP in the absence of added sybodies.

Dual-sybody competition ELISA
Purified sybodies carrying a C-terminal myc-His Tag (Sb_init expression vector) were diluted to 25 nM
in 100 µl PBS pH 7.4 and directly coated on Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plates (ThermoFisher #44-2404-21)
at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed once with 250 µl TBS pH 7.5 per well followed by blocking
with 250 µl TBS pH 7.5 containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA per well. In parallel, chemically biotinylated prefusion
Spike protein (PFS) at a concentration of 10 nM was incubated with 500 nM sybodies for 1 h at room

temperature in TBS-BSA-T. The plates were washed three times with 250 µl TBS-T per well. Then, 100
µl of the PFS-sybody mixtures were added to the corresponding wells and incubated for 3 min,
followed by washing three times with 250 µl TBS-T per well. 100 µl Streptavidin-peroxidase polymer
(Merck, Cat#S2438) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-BSA-T was added to each well and incubated for 10 min,
followed by washing three times with 250 µl TBS-T per well. Finally, to detect PFS bound to the
immobilized sybodies, 100 µl ELISA developing buffer (prepared as described previously [36]) was
added to each well, incubated for 1 h (due to low signal) and absorbance was measured at 650 nm. As
a negative control, TBS-BSA-T devoid of protein was added to the corresponding wells instead of a PFSsybody mixture.

Figure 8
Sybodies inhibit RBD binding to ACE2. The eﬀect of sybodies on RBD associa on with human ACE2 was assessed with an
ELISA. Individual sybodies (500 nM, sybody number shown on X-axis) were incubated with bio nylated RBD-vYFP (25 nM)
and the mixtures were exposed to immobilized ACE2. Bound RBD-vYFP was detected with streptavidin-peroxidase/TMB.
Each column indicates background-subtracted absorbance at 405 nm, normalized to the signal corresponding to RBD-vYFP
in the absence of sybody (dashed red line).

Figure 9
Simultaneous binding of Sb#15 and Sb#68. (A) Simultaneous binding of sybodies was analyzed using gra ng-coupled
interferometry on the WAVE system (Creop x AG, Switzerland). Bio nylated ECD was immobilized and the binders were
injected alone and simultaneously at satura ng concentra ons (Sb#15: 200 nM, Sb#45: 500 nM, Sb#68: 500 nM).
Superimposed sensorgrams are shown. (B) Compe on ELISA. Title of the graphs indicate the sybody which was directly
coated on the plate at a concentra on of 25 nM. The labels on the x-axes depict the sybody used for compe on. To
determine the background signal, buﬀer devoid of protein was added.
