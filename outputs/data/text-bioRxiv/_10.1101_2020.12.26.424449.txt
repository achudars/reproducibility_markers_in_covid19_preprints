MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody

24

response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the

25

spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key

26

B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B

27

cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general

28

population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM

29

cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.

Introduction

35

Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 the individual undergoes seroconversion. In mildly

36

symptomatic patients, seroconversion occurs between day 7 and 14, includes IgM and IgG, and

37

outlasts virus detection with generally higher IgG levels in symptomatic than asymptomatic

38

groups in the early convalescent phase (1). Alarmingly, the IgG levels in both asymptomatic and

39

symptomatic patients decline during the early convalescent phase, with a median decrease of

40

~75% within 2–3 months after infection (2). This suggests that the systemic antibody response

41

which follows natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is rapid but short-lived, with the possibility of

42

no residual immunity after 6-12 months (3) affecting primarily neutralizing antibodies in plasma

43

(4).

44

The generation of an antibody response requires cooperation between a B cell producing

45

specific antibody molecules and a CD4 T cell (helper cell) activated by an epitope on the same

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424449; this version posted December 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

46

antigen as that recognized by the B cell (T-B cooperation) (5). This reaction occurs in the

47

germinal center (6,7). Excluded from this rule are responses against carbohydrates and antigens

48

with repeating motifs that alone cross-link the B cell antigen receptor leading to B cell activation

49

(8). Discovered over 50 years ago (9–11), it also became apparent that T-B cooperation is

50

restricted by Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecules (12–14). T-B

51

cooperation plays a key role in the facilitation and strength of the antibody response (10,15) and

52

the size of the antibody response is proportional to the number of Th cells activated by the B cell

53

during T-B cooperation (13,14,16). The importance of T cell help during the activation of

54

antigen specific B cells to protein antigens driving B cell selection is emphasized by recent

55

experiments where the injection of a conjugate of antigen (OVA) linked with an anti-DEC205

56

antibody induced a greater proliferation of DEC205+ relative to DEC205- B cells consistent with

57

a T helper effect on B cell activation (17).

58

T-B cooperation requires that the epitopes recognized by the B and T cell be on the same

59

portion of the antigen (11,18,19) leading to a model requiring the contextual internalization and

60

co-processing of T and B cell epitopes (5) which is consistent with the principle of linked (aka

61

associative) recognition of antigen (20). Studies in vitro using human T and B lymphocytes

62

showed that an antigen specific B cell can present antigen to CD4 T cells even if antigen is

63

present at very low concentration (10-11 – 10-12 M) (21). Presentation of antigen by the B cell also

64

facilitates the cooperation between CD4 T cells of different specificities resulting in enhanced

65

generation of memory CD4 T cells (22). However, T-B cooperation is not the only form of

66

cooperative interaction among lymphocytes as cooperation exists between CD4 T and CD8 T

67

cells (23) and between two CD4 T cells responding to distinct epitopes on the same antigen (24).

68

A model based on coprocessing of T and B epitopes also led to the suggestion that

69

preferential T-B pairing could be based on topological proximity (25–29) so that during BCR-

70

mediated internalization the T cell epitope is protected by the paratope of the BCR. Indeed, a

71

more recent study showed that not only is CD4 T cell help a limiting factor in the development

72

of antibodies to smallpox (vaccinia virus), but that there also exists a deterministic epitope

73

linkage of specificities in T-B cooperation against this viral pathogen (30). Collectively, it

74

appears that T-B pairing and MHC-II restriction are key events in the selection of the antibody

75

response to pathogens and that operationally T-B cooperation and MHC-II restriction are key

76

events in the generation of an adaptive antibody response, suggesting that lack of or defective T-

77

B preferential pairing could result in an antibody response that is suboptimal, short-lived, or

78

both.

79

In SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are a key defense mechanism against

80

infection and transmission. NAbs generated by single memory B cell VH/VL cloning from

81

convalescent COVID-19 patients have been extremely useful in defining the fine epitope

82

specificity of the antibody response in COVID-19 individuals. At present, SARS-CoV-2 NAbs

83

can be distinguished into three large categories. 1) Repurposed antibodies, that is, NAbs

84

discovered and characterized in the context of SARS-CoV and subsequently found to neutralize

85

SARS-CoV-2 via cross-reactivity. These antibodies map away from the receptor binding domain

86

(RBD) of the spike protein (31–33). 2) Non-RBD neutralizing antibodies discovered in SARS-

87

CoV-2 patients whose paratope is specific for sites outside the RBD (34). 3) RBD antibodies,

88

including NAbs, derived from SARS-CoV-2 patients that map to a restricted site in the RBD

89

(35–41). Cryo-EM of this third antibody category shows that they bind to residues in or around

90

the four amino acids Phe-Asp-Cys-Tyr (FNCY) in the receptor binding motif (RBM) (residues

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424449; this version posted December 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

91

437-508) which is inside the larger RBD (residues 319-541) at the virus:ACE2 interface (36).

92

Although the RBD has been shown to be an immunodominant target of serum antibodies in

93

COVID-19 patients (42), high potency NAbs are directed against a conserved portion of the

94

RBM on or around the FNCY patch, a sequence only found in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and not

95

in other coronaviruses. Indeed while the RBD is mutationally tolerant, the RBM is constrained to

96

the wild-type amino acids (43), implying that the B cell epitope included in this region of the

97

virus:ACE2 interface is resistant to antigenic drift. Thus, we may refer to this site as a key RBM

98

B cell epitope in the generation of potent NAbs.

99

Antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 depend on CD4 T cell help. Spike-specific

100

CD4 T cell responses have been found to correlate with the magnitude of the anti-RBD IgG

101

response whereas non-spike CD4 T cell responses do not (44). However, spike-specific CD4 T

102

cells reactive with MHC-II peptides proximal to the central B cell epitope represent a minority

103

(~10%) of the total CD4 T cell responses, which are dominated by responses against either the

104

distal portion of the spike protein or other structural antigens (45). Surprisingly, these CD4 T cell

105

responses are largely cross-reactive and originate from previous coronavirus infections (46).

106

As mounting evidence suggests that the NAb response in COVID-19 patients is relatively

107

short-lived, we decided to test the hypothesis that associative recognition of the key RBM B cell

108

epitope and proximal MHC-II-restricted epitopes may be defective with detrimental effects on

109

preferential T-B pairing. Therefore, to quantify the potential effects of T-B cooperation in vivo,

110

we analyzed all 15mer putative MHC-II epitopes (+/- 50 amino acid residues) relative to the key

111

RBM B cell epitope for coverage by all known 5,620 human MHC-II alleles and predicted

112

binding affinity. The analysis shows that there exists in general less availability of effective T

113

cell epitopes in close proximity to the key RBM B cell epitope in the human population.

Results

116

Topology of a key RBM B cell epitope

117

Within the 222 amino acid long RBD of the spike protein (residues 319-541), the RBM (residues

118

437-508) is the portion of the spike protein that establishes contact with the ACE2 receptor (Fig

119

1A). The contact residues span a relatively large surface involving approximately 17 residues

120

(36), among them residues F486, N487, Y489 form a loop, which we term the FNCY patch,

121

which is surface exposed and protrudes up towards the ACE2 receptor from the bulge of the

122

RBD (Fig 1B-C). F486 forms hydrophobic interactions with three ACE2 residues (L79, M82,

123

W83). N487 forms hydrogen bonds with Q24 and W83, and Y489 is linked with K31 via a

124

hydrophobic interaction. This makes the amino acid residues in or around the FNCY patch a

125

logical B cell epitope target for antibodies blocking the virus:receptor interaction. In addition,

126

these core residues are mutationally constrained by the ACE2 contact surface (43). Not

127

surprisingly, a set of recently reported potently neutralizing antibodies generated by single B cell

128

VH/VL cloning from convalescent COVID-19 patients all bear paratopes that include the FNCY

129

patch in their recognition site (34,39–41,47) (Fig 1D). While other residues (Q493, N501, and

130

Y505) are also shared between ACE2 and the paratope of these antibodies, they are not as

131

protruding and are on a β-sheet unlike the FNCY patch which is organized in a short loop as a

132

result of the C480:C488 disulfide bond. Thus, blockade of the RBM:ACE2 interaction

133

(neutralization) depends at least in part on a B cell epitope in the RBM that is structurally and

134

functionally critical to the interaction, virus internalization, and cell infectivity.

Prediction of MHC-II affinity for 15mer peptides proximal to the RBM B cell epitope

147

In the T-B cooperation model, B cell activation and production of NAbs is dependent on CD4 T

148

cell responses to MHC-II restricted peptides. To test the hypothesis that the generation of NAbs
bs

149

against a mutationally constrained B cell epitope in the RBM reflects the efficiency of processing

and presentation of MHC-II peptides proximal to the FNCY patch, we evaluated the landscape of

151

MHC-II peptide restriction across the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with respect to common

152

MHC-II alleles in the human population. To assess the potential for effective restriction by

153

MHC-II molecules in a reasonable proportion of the population, we devised a position-based

154

score that assigns each amino acid residue the median affinity of the best overlapping peptide,

155

where median affinity is calculated across the 1911 most common MHC-II alleles (Fig 2A),

156

which was highly correlated with scores across all 5620 MHC-II alleles (Fig 2B; Pearson

157

rho=0.99, p<2.2e-308). While a number of sites along the spike protein are predicted to generate

158

high affinity peptides for most common MHC-II alleles, the region around the FNCY patch was

159

depleted for generally effective binders (Fig 2C, Fisher’s exact OR=0.21, p=0.015, Methods,

160

Supplemental Fig 1). Interestingly, the RBM region containing the FNCY patch was free of

161

glycans that could potentially mask the epitope (Fig 2D). We further evaluated the distributions

162

of binding affinities for the 20 best-ranked peptides across all sites in the spike protein (Fig 2E),

163

and in comparison, the distributions for the best 20 peptides overlapping positions within +/- 50

164

residues of the FNCY patch (Fig 2F). In the best case, less than half of the considered MHC-II

165

alleles bound a shared peptide close to the FNCY patch, whereas at other sites there were

166

multiple peptides that could be bound by nearly all of the MHC-II alleles (Fig 2E). This

167

suggested overall less availability of effective T cell epitopes in close proximity to the FNCY B

168

cell epitope, which could limit the availability of T cell help during an epitope-specific T-B

169

cooperative interaction in the germinal center.

186

To further assess whether population variation in MHC-II MHC alleles might contribute

187

to heterogeneity in potential to generate neutralizing antibodies, we also evaluated the potential

188

of MHC-II supertypes to restrict peptides from neighboring the FNCY patch. Greenbaum et al.

189

previously defined 7 supertypes that group MHC-II alleles based on shared binding repertoire.

190

These 7 supertypes account for between 46%-77% of haplotypes and cover over 98% of

191

individuals when all four loci are considered together (50). We revisited our analysis of peptide

192

restriction proximal to the FNCY patch treating each supertype separately. There was

193

considerable variability in potential to effectively present FNCY patch proximal sequences

194

across supertypes (Fig 3A-B, Χ2=175, p=3.75e-35, Supplemental Fig 2). Only 3 supertypes

195

(DP2, main DP and DR4) commonly presented peptides overlapping the FNCY patch (Fig 3B).

196

We were able to obtain population allele frequencies for four populations from the Be The Match

197

registry (51) and Du et al. (52). These data show that DR4 is relatively infrequent across the

198

populations evaluated, whereas main DR, main DP, and DP2 are more common (Fig 3C), and

199

thus could be more important for MHC-II restriction supportive of neutralizing antibodies. While

200

there were some large population-specific differences in main DP and DP2 supertype

201

frequencies, these frequency estimates are based on a limited population sample and may provide

202

only a rough approximation. In general, DP and DR haplotypes were able to restrict more FNCY

203

patch proximal sequences (Fig 3D).

Cross-reactivity to a non-coronavirus MHC-II binding peptide as a potential driver of T

cell responses helping antibody response to the RBM B cell epitope

216

Interestingly, Mateus et al. reported pre-existing CD4 T cell responses to peptides derived from

217

the spike protein using T cells from unexposed individuals, suggesting previous exposures to

218

other human coronaviruses could potentially generate protective immunity toward SARS-CoV-2.

219

Indeed, regions of higher coronavirus homology were associated with more T cell responses in

220

their data (46). This represents the most comprehensive interrogation of the spike protein with

221

response to CD4 T cell responses to date. They screened all 15mers of the spike protein in

222

pooled format and further evaluated 66 predicted MHC-II peptides that generated CD4 T cell

223

responses. Visualizing the landscape of the CD4 T cell responses described in their work by

224

percent positive response (Fig 4A) or spot forming cells (Fig 4B), we noted relatively few

A notable exception in Mateus’ results is peptide 486FNCYFPLQSYGFQPT500, which

peptide was restricted by HLA-DRB1*0101 or HLA-DQA1*0101/DQB1*0501. We found that
at

the peptide sequence had greater in silico predicted affinity to HLA-DRB1*0101. To explain the

238

conundrum, we blasted this peptide against the “refseq_protein” database excluding SARS-CoV--

262

SARS-CoV-2 uses the RBD of the spike protein to bind to the ACE2 receptor on target cells.

263

The actual contact with ACE2 is mediated by a discrete number of amino acids that have been

264

visualized by cryo-EM (Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020). Although several SARS-related

265

coronaviruses share 75% homology and interact with ACE2 on target cells (Ge et al., 2013; Ren

266

et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2015) the RBM in SARS-CoV-2 is unique to this virus. In vitro binding

267

measurements show that SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to ACE2 with an affinity in the low

268

nanomolar range (Walls et al., 2020). Mutations in this motif could be detrimental to the virus’s

269

ability to infect ACE2 positive human cells. Since the RBD is an immunodominant site in the

270

antibody response in humans (42) it is not surprising that the paratope of some antibodies

271

isolated from convalescent individuals via single B cell VH/VL cloning, and selected on the

272

basis of high neutralization potency, all seem to bind a surface encompassing the FNCY patch in

273

the RBM (35,37–41,53). Arguably, this motif corresponds to a relevant B cell epitope in the

274

spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and is a logical target of potent neutralizing antibodies.

275

Although antibodies directed to this site have been isolated by different groups, little is

276

known about their contribution to the pool of antibodies in serum of SARS-CoV-2 infected

277

individuals, but evidence suggests they are likely to be rare. In one study they were found to

278

represent a subdominant fraction of the anti-RBD response (41) while the estimated frequency of

279

antigen-specific B cells ranges from 0.07 to 0.005% of all the total B cells in COVID-19

280

convalescent individuals (54). In a second study, the identification of two ultra-potent NAbs

281

having a paratope involving the FNCY patch required screening of 800 clones from twelve

282

individuals (53). This suggests that a potent NAb response to a mutationally constrained RBM

283

epitope is a rare component of the total anti-virus response consistent, with the observation that

284

there is no correlation between RBM site-specific neutralizing antibodies and serum half-

285

maximal neutralization titer (NT50) (54). Here we show that the core RBM B cell epitope is

286

apparently uncoupled from preferential T-B pairing, a prerequisite for a coordinated activation of

287

B cells against the pathogen. We analyzed MHC-II binding of 15mer peptides in the spike

288

protein upstream (-50 aa) or downstream (+50 aa) of the central RBM B cell epitope and found

289

both low coverage by 1911 common MHC-II alleles and a depletion of binding 15mers proximal

290

to the FNCY patch versus other exposed areas on the spike protein. This could be due to the fact

291

that a sizeable proportion (40%) of CD4 T cells responding to the spike protein are memory

292

responses found in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (44,55) or other structural protein of

293

SARS-CoV-2 such as the N protein (45). Thus, it is possible that these conserved responses are

294

used as a decoy mechanism to polarize the response away from the RBM. However, this does not

295

rule out the contribution of a bias in frequency of specific B cells in the available repertoire.

296

Corroboration to our hypothesis also comes from Mateus et al. (46) who tested sixty-six

297

15mer peptides of the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals and found that CD4

298

T cell responses against this narrow RBM site account for only 2/110 (1.8%) of the total CD4 T

299

cell response to 15mer peptides of the spike protein. Surprisingly, a CD4 T cell response against

300

peptide FNCYFPLQSYGFQPT was by CD4 T cells of an unexposed individual. Since this

301

peptide has low homology with previous human coronaviruses, we reasoned that this could either

302

represent a case of TCR cross-reactivity since a single TCR can engage large numbers of unique

303

MHC/peptide combinations without requiring degeneracy in their recognition (56,57).

304

Remarkably, however, a BLAST analysis revealed a 10 amino acid sequence match with

305

proteins from pathogens including those from the Cryptosporidium genus, with identity in

306

binding motif and anchor residues (agretope) for the restricting MHC-II allele strongly

307

suggesting peptide cross-reactivity. Cryptosporidium hominis is a parasite that causes watery

308

diarrhea that can last up to 3 weeks in immunocompetent patients (58). Additional possibilities

309

for cross-reactivity to the RBM, albeit of a lesser stringency, involve antigens from

310

Micromonospora, Pseudomonas, Blastococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides (Fig 5D). Thus,

311

it appears as if memory CD4 T cells reactive with peptides in the RBM may reflect the

312

immunological history of the individual that, as evidenced by this case, can be unrelated to

313

infection by other coronaviruses. Interestingly, the great majority (64-88%) of COVID-19

314

positive individuals in homeless shelters in Los Angeles and Boston were found to be

315

asymptomatic (59). This suggests that the status of the immune system, which itself reflects past

316

antigenic exposure, may be a determining factor in the generation of a protective immune

317

response after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

318

The findings reported herein have considerable implications for natural immunity to

319

SARS-CoV-2. The fact that there seems to be an overall suboptimal T-B preferential pairing

320

suggests that B cells that respond to the RBM B cell epitope may receive inadequate T cell help.

321

This is consistent with the observation that in general potent neutralizing antibodies to the RBM

322

undergo very limited somatic mutation (38,53) and are by and large in quasi-germline

323

configuration (60). Since T cell help is also necessary to initiate somatic hypermutation in B cell

324

through CD40 or CD38 signaling in the germinal center (61), it follows that one important

325

implication of our study is that defective T-B pairing may negatively influence the normal

326

process of germinal center maturation of the B cell response in response to SARS-CoV-2

327

infection in a critical way.

328

Which antigens can generate T cell responses depends on the binding specificities of

329

MHC-II molecules, which are highly polymorphic in the human population. We noted a general

330

trend for MHC-II alleles to less effectively present peptides from the RBM region, but also

331

observed some variability across MHC-II supertypes. The main DP and DP2 haplotypes were

332

both common and had the highest potential to present peptides, suggesting that most individuals

333

should carry at least one allele capable of presenting peptides in this region. Which of the two

334

DP haplotypes was more common varied by ancestral population, thus it is possible that

335

differences in the haplotypes could translate to differences in T-B cooperativity levels within

336

groups, though binding affinities for epitopes near the FNCY patch were similar for both. DQ

337

and DR supertypes were less able to present peptides near FNCY, with the exception of DR4,

338

which is among the less common supertypes. Importantly, our analysis was limited to predicted

339

affinity of peptides to MHC-II, and other characteristics such as expression levels, stability or

340

differences in interactions with molecular chaperones likely also contribute to whether FNCY

341

proximal peptides are available to support B-T cooperation (62).

342

In light of our findings, it can be predicted that, in general, a specific RBM antibody

343

response may be short-lived and that residual immunity from a primary infection may not be

344

sufficient to prevent reinfection after 6-9 months. Sporadic cases of re-infection have been

345

reported by the media in Hong Kong and Nevada (63). A third case has been reported in a care-

346

home resident who after the second infection produced only low levels of antibodies (64).

347

Finally, silent re-infections in young workers in a COVID-19 ward who tested positive for the

348

new coronavirus and became reinfected several months later with no symptoms in either instance

349

have been reported (65). It is tempting to speculate that waning antibody levels or a poorly

350

developed specific NAb antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can potentially put people at risk of

351

reinfection. Other factors to consider are a bias in the available B cell repertoire in the population

352

and the extent to which a defective T-B cooperation influences the longevity of terminally

353

differentiated plasma cells in the bone marrow (66).

354

In summary, we provide evidence that MHC-II constrains the CD4 T cell response for

355

epitopes that are best positioned to facilitate T-B pairing in generating and sustaining a potent

356

neutralizing antibody response against a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope.

357

Furthermore, we show that the immunological history of the individual, not necessarily related to

358

infection by other coronaviruses, may confer immunologic advantage. Finally, these findings

359

may have implications for the quality and persistence of a protective, neutralizing antibody

360

response to RBM induced by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Data and code are available at https://github.com/cartercompbio/SARS_CoV_2_T-B_co-op.
Affinity analysis
NetMHCIIpan version 4.0 was used to predict peptide-MHC-II affinity (69) for generated
15mers along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
Spike protein analyses
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence and protein regions were obtained from
https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0DTC2. Glycan data were obtained from (49) and true-positive
sites were aggregated across 3 replicates. To assess depletion of effective binders near the FNCY
patch, we performed a Fisher’s exact test for binding (median affinity across common alleles
<10) versus proximity (+/- 50 amino acids) to FNCY for positions free of glycans. We excluded
positions within 10 amino acids of a glycan using the data obtained from Watanabe et al. and
added a pseudocount of 1.
The SARS1, MERS1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 spike protein
sequences were also downloaded from UniProt (P59594, K9N5Q8, P15423, Q6Q1S2, P36334,
Q0ZME7, respectively). Multiple sequence alignment was performed on the EMBL-EBI Clustal
Omega web server using default parameters (70).
Structure analysis
The 6M0J 3D X-ray structure for the protein complex containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
RBD (P0DTC2) interaction with ACE2 (Q9BYF1) from (36). The structure figures were
prepared using VMD (71).

Supertype analysis
Supertypes were obtained from (50). All alpha/beta combinations spanning any of these types
were included, resulting in 279 alleles. US supertype frequencies for alleles in DRB1 and DQB1
were obtained from the Be the Match registry (51), US frequencies for alleles in DPB1 were
obtained from (52) as DPB1 was not available from the Be the Match registry. Available allele
frequencies within each supertype were summed for Fig 3C.

Motif analysis
All 13-20mer peptides adhering to the following parameters were downloaded from the IEDB
(72): MHC-II assay, positive only, DRB1*01:01 allele, linear peptides; and any peptides with
post-translational modifications or noncanonical amino acids were removed. The remaining
10,117 peptides were input into Gibbs cluster v2.0 (73) using the default MHC-II ligand
parameters.
BLAST analysis
15mers were generated along a sliding window +/-30 amino acids from the FNCY patch start
and end (455-518, 0-index) and input into NCBI BLAST (74) using the ‘refseq_protein’ database
and excluding SARS-CoV-2 (taxid:2697049). Identified peptides (Supplemental table 2) were
then evaluated for binding affinity and any peptide binding to at least one allele was retained for
Fig 5D.
