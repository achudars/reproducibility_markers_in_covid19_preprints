Abstract

32

Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)

33

has caused a pandemic of historic proportions and continues to spread worldwide.

34

Currently, there is no effective therapy against this virus. This article evaluated the

35

in vitro antiviral effect of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 and also identified the

36

interaction affinity between Atorvastatin and three SARS-CoV-2 proteins, using in

37

silico structure-based molecular docking approach. Materials and methods: The

38

antiviral activity of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by three

39

different treatment strategies using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction

40

of Atorvastatin with Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like

41

protease (3CLpro) was evaluated by molecular docking. Results: Atorvastatin

42

showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 79%, 54.8%, 22.6% and 25% at 31.2, 15.6, 7.9,

43

and 3.9 µM, respectively, by pre-post-treatment strategy. In addition, atorvastatin

44

demonstrated an antiviral effect of 26.9% at 31.2 µM by pre-infection treatment. This

45

compound also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in 66.9%, 75%, 27.9% and 29.2% at

46

concentrations of 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 µM, respectively, by post-infection

47

treatment. The interaction of atorvastatin with SARS-CoV-2 Spike, RdRp and 3CL

48

protease yielded a binding affinity of -8.5 Kcal/mol, -6.2 Kcal/mol, and -7.5 Kcal/mol,

49

respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2

50

activity of Atorvastatin, mainly against the late steps of the viral replicative cycle. A

51

favorable binding affinity with viral proteins by bioinformatics methods was also

52

shown. Due to its low cost, availability, well-established safety and tolerability, and

53

the extensive clinical experience of atorvastatin, it could prove valuable in reducing

54

morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

55

Importance

56

The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a

57

century, with enormous health and socioeconomic challenges. Therefore, it is

58

necessary to search for specific antivirals against its causative agent (SARS-CoV-

59

2). In this sense, the use of existing drugs may represent a useful treatment option

60

in terms of safety, cost-effectiveness, and timeliness. Atorvastatin is widely used to

prevent cardiovascular events. This compound modulates the synthesis of

62

cholesterol, a molecule necessary in different stages of the viral replicative cycle.

63

Our study demonstrated the antiviral potential of atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2,

64

using an in vitro model. Furthermore, the ability of Atorvastatin to directly interfere

65

with three viral targets (Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease) was demonstrated by

66

bioinformatic methods. This compound is a well-studied, low-cost, and generally

67

well-tolerated drug, so it could be a promising antiviral for the treatment of COVID-

68

19.

Introduction

72

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus

73

(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) reported for the first time in

74

Wuhan, China [1]. On March 12, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization)

75

declared COVID-19 a pandemic [2]. Since then, it has affected 218 countries and

76

territories worldwide, causing enormous human health consequences [1, 3].

77

Currently, disease control has been based on symptom management, including the

78

use

79

corticosteroids, IL-1 and IL-16 inhibitors, Azithromycin, Remdesivir, Baricitinib,

80

Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Hydroxychloroquine, and, in severe cases, supportive care

81

(oxygen and mechanical ventilation) [4, 5]. Although there may be approved drugs

82

[6], there is still no conclusive information on their effectiveness and they have limited

83

uses. For this reason, the search for effective and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2

84

antivirals is necessary [7]. The development of new drugs involves the evaluation of

85

the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic safety, with the implementation of

86

large-scale production and distribution, a process that takes many years. Due to this

87

panorama and the rapid expansion of the pandemic, the use of existing drugs may

88

represent a useful COVID-19 treatment option in terms of safety, cost-effectiveness,

89

and timeliness [8].

90

Atorvastatin (ATV) belongs to statins, a group of hypolipidemic drugs that acts

91

inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. ATV was approved by the FDA (Food and Drug

92

Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) to prevent cardiovascular

93

events in patients with cardiac risk factors or with abnormal lipid profiles [9, 10]. The

94

ability of ATV to modulate cholesterol synthesis has previously been related to

95

antiviral activity against viruses such as Hepatitis C virus [11], Dengue virus [12],

96

Zika virus [13], Influenza A virus [14] and human parainfluenza virus type 1 [15]. This

97

drug also participates in modulating several cellular metabolic pathways that could

98

affect the viral replicative cycle [11, 12].

99

It has been proposed that statins could be an effective therapeutic strategy against

100

SARS-CoV-2 infection [16]. Recently, it has been reported that statin treatment was

of

synthetic

antibodies,

associated with a reduced risk of mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [17,

102

18]. Furthermore, during in silico analysis, ATV interacts with the 3CL protease of

103

SARS-CoV-2 [19]. However, there is no in vitro evidence of its antiviral effect against

104

SARS-CoV-2 or its binding affinity for other viral proteins such as Spike and RNA-

105

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This article evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect

106

of the ATV against SARS-CoV-2, and identified the interaction affinity between ATV

107

and three SARS-CoV-2 proteins, using an in silico structure-based molecular

108

docking approach.

109

Results

110

Atorvastatin showed a low cytotoxicity on Vero E6.

111

Before the antiviral activity evaluation, the cytotoxic effect of ATV on Vero E6 cells

112

was determined by MTT assay. As shown in Figure 1, the Vero E6 viability was

113

higher than 90% at a concentration of 31.2 µM or less of ATV. At higher ATV

114

concentrations (62.5 to 250 µM), cell viability was lower or equal to 48.4%. The CC50

115

calculated for ATV was 50.3 µM.

116

Cell viability was not affected by CQ and Heparin (positive controls of viral inhibition)

117

at the concentrations that were evaluated (Supplementary figure 1). The CC50

118

obtained by CQ was more than 100 µM, and by Heparin was more than 100 µg/mL.

119

ATV exhibited antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent

120

manner.

121

To evaluate the antiviral activity of ATV against SARS-CoV-2, a pre-post treatment

122

strategy was performed in Vero E6 cells. ATV showed inhibition percentages of

123

SARS-CoV-2 of 79% (p=0.002), 54.8% (p=0.002), 22.6% (p=0.04) and 25%

124

(p=0.03) at concentrations of 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 µM, respectively (Figure 2).

125

Based on these data, the EC50 calculated for ATV was 15.4 µM, with a selectivity

126

index of 3.3.

127

Chloroquine (positive control of viral inhibition) showed inhibition percentages of

128

100% (p=0.002), 99.9%(p=0.002), 97.5% (p=0.002) and 55.7% (p=0.002) at 100,

129

50, 25, and 12.5 µM concentrations, respectively (Supplementary figure 2). An

130

EC50 value of 13.5 µM was found by CQ, with a selectivity index of >7.4.

131

ATV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through post-infection treatment.

132

Once an antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 was observed, the pre-infection and

133

post-infection treatments were done independently to infer the viral replication step

134

affected by the ATV treatment. During the pre-infection treatment, anti-SARS-CoV-

135

2 activity was observed at 31.2 µM (inhibition of 26.9%, p=0.012). Inhibition

136

percentages of 8.1%, 20.8% and 13.9% were seen at concentrations of 15.6, 7.9

137

and 3.9 µM of ATV, respectively (Figures 3A-C). The EC50 calculated for ATV was

138

12.1 µM, with a selectivity index of 4.2, by the pre-infection treatment.

139

In comparison, as shown in Figures 3D-F the viral titer of SARS-CoV-2 was

140

significantly reduced through post-infection treatment with ATV at all concentrations

141

evaluated. Inhibition percentages of 66.9% (p=0.004), 75.0% (p=0.004), 27.9%

142

(p=0.004), and 29.2% (p=0.006) were obtained at concentrations of 31.2, 15.6, 7.9,

143

and 3.9 µM of ATV, respectively (EC50= 11.1 µM, IS= 4.5).

144

The positive controls for viral inhibition during pre-infection and post-infection

145

treatments were Heparin and Chloroquine, respectively. By, pre-infection treatment,

146

Heparin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 100 µg/mL (80.6%, p=0.028),

147

50 µg/mL (82.9%, p=0.028), 25 µg/mL (87.3%, p=0.028), and 12.5 µg/mL (79.9%,

148

p=0.028) (Supplementary figure 3A). On the other hand, as shown in

149

Supplementary figure 3B, inhibition percentages of 99.2% (p=0.009), 98.3%

150

(p=0.009), 74.8% (p=0.009) and 23.6% (p=0.033) were obtained at concentrations

151

of 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 µM concentrations of Chloroquine, using post-infection

152

treatment (EC50=12.76, IS>7.8).

153

Binding site determination of viral proteins

154

Before molecular docking, pockets and expected amino acids were selected to

155

assess the interaction affinity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with ATV. The Spike protein

156

(PDB:6VYB) had 79 pockets (Supplementary figure 4A), the pocket score value

157

82.76 was the number one and consisted of 114 amino acids. The 3CL protease

158

(PDB:6M2N) showed 15 pockets (Supplementary figure 4B), and the highest score

159

was obtained in pocket number one and consisted of 19 amino acids. Finally, the

160

SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB:6M71) had 37 pockets (Supplementary figure 4C). The

161

pocket with the best score was the number one with 8.79 and consisted of 23 amino

162

acids. The first binding site is the highest pocket score for all pockets in each protein

163

analyzed, favoring the interaction and binding with different ligands. The grid centers

164

of these pocket sites are shown in table 1.

165

ATV demonstrated favorable binding affinities with SARS-CoV-2 proteins by

166

molecular docking

167

The binding affinity of all docked and analyzed compounds with their binding energy

168

ranking is shown in table 2. The results revealed that ATV exhibited high interaction

169

affinity and coupling with the different hydrophobic pockets selected from the Spike

170

(-8.5 Kcal/mol), RdRp (-6.2 Kcal/mol) and 3CL protease (-7.5 Kcal/mol) proteins of

171

SARS-CoV-2 (table 2).

172

The molecular interactions of ATV as a ligand with Spike, RdRp and 3Clpro proteins

173

of SARS-CoV-2 were numerous and explained the high affinity presented (Figure

174

4). Specifically, ATV formed five distance hydrogen bonds with Spike protein

175

(distances of 1,998 Å, 2,867 Å, 3,280 Å, 3,590 Å, 3,336 Å). In these bonds

176

participated amino acids ASN1023, THR1027, SER1021, and GLU1017 of Spike. In

177

addition, ATV formed hydrophobic interactions such as Pi-Alkyl and Pi-Sigma with

178

Spike protein. Amino acid LEU1024 was involved in Pi-pi T shaped, while ALA1020

179

and ALA1026 participated in Pi-alkyl bonds (Figure 4A-B).

180

ATV formed two conventional hydrogen bonds with the amino acids TYR69 and

181

TYR217 of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Distances of 2,879 Å and 3,425 Å, respectively).

182

Other types of interactions were also seen, such as donor hydrogen bonds that were

183

part of the hydrophobic pocket. In the same way, hydrophobic interactions were

184

found with the type of bonds pi-sigma, pi-alkyl, Pi-pi T shaped and Pi-cation. Amino

185

acids THR123 and VAL71 of RdRp formed bonds pi-sigma with ATV, LEU119 and

186

LYS121 participated in pi-alkyl bonds, PHE36 formed bonds Pi-pi T shaped and

187

ARG33 Pi-cation interactions (Figure 4C and 4D).

188

On the other hand, ATV formed six hydrogen bonds with HIS164, CYS145, ASN142,

189

LEU141, SER144, and THR25 of 3CL protease, with distances of 3,121 Å, 3,197 Å,

190

2,637 Å, 2,477 Å, 3,024 Å, 2,944 Å, respectively. In this complex, it also participated

191

in hydrophobic interactions such as pi-sigma, pi-alkyl and pi-sulf (Figure 4E-F).

192

Additionally, Chloroquine (positive inhibition control) showed the binding affinity of -

193

5.9 Kcal/mol, -5.6 Kcal/mol, and -6.3 Kcal/mol with Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease

194

of SARS-CoV-2, respectively (table 2). Chloroquine formed two hydrogen bonds

195

with Spike protein (distances 3.897 and 3.302 Å) and hydrophobic interactions such

196

as Pi-sigma and Pi-alkyl with the amino acids LEU1024, THR1027, and ALA1026 of

197

Spike (Supplementary figures 5A and 5B). Further, a hydrogen bond was formed

198

between CQ and amino acids TYR217 of RdRp (distance of 2,544 Å). Six

199

hydrophobic interactions (Pi-pi Stacked, Pi-sigma, Pi-Alkyl) were observed with

200

amino acids THR123 (3,468 Å), PHE35 (5,386 Å) (5,053 Å), ARG33 (4,673 Å) and

201

VAL71 (5,006 Å) of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Supplementary figures 5C and 5D).

202

Finally, Chloroquine formed two hydrogen bonds (distances of 2,959 Å and 2,822 Å)

203

and hydrophobic interactions (Pi-stacked, Pi-sigma, Pi-alkyl) with 3CL protease

204

(Supplementary figures 5E and 5F).

205

Discussion

206

In the present study, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of Atorvastatin was identified by

207

the treatment of Vero E6 cells, at different times of infection. ATV has been shown

208

to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, affecting cholesterol synthesis and the production of

209

isoprenoid metabolites [13]. Previously, it has been reported that cholesterol-

210

modifying drugs could exert antiviral effects by modulating cellular metabolic

211

pathways required for the replicative cycle, or by direct effect against viral particles

212

[20, 21]. Concerning SARS-CoV-2, it has been suggested that statins may help to

213

reduce viral entry and transmission [22]. Based on our results, alteration in the

214

cholesterol metabolism by ATV treatment seems to affect different stages of the

215

SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle where this lipid is involved, such as adhesion [23];

216

endocytosis [24, 25] and fusion [23]; replication [26] and viral particle assembly [27,

217

28].

218

A previous study suggested that other statin, Fluvastatin, reduced SARS-CoV-2

219

entry into the respiratory epithelium cells [29]. Similar to this report, our study

220

demonstrated that ATV inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at 31.2 µM by pretreating cells for 1h.

221

These findings suggest that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of ATV affected at early

222

stages of the viral replicative cycle. This effect could be related to the fact that the

223

ACE2 cell receptors, used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell, are present in lipid rafts,

224

cholesterol-rich microdomains present at the cell membrane [24, 25]. In addition, a

225

study showed that cholesterol transports ACE2 to sites where SARS-CoV-2

226

effectively enters the cell [23]. Therefore, an alteration at the level of cholesterol

227

present at the cell membrane by ATV treatment, could affect viral attachment;

228

however, additional experiments are needed to confirm this mechanism.

229

It has been also reported that statins upregulate ACE2 through epigenetic

230

modifications [30]. Although this would be expected to promote viral infection, there

231

is not current evidence indicating that statins enhance viral entry into host cells [31].

232

Conversely, the increase in the ACE2 receptor expression could be associated with

233

a reduction of the severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [32]. In

234

this regard, ACE2 metabolizes the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II to produce

235

angiotensin 1-7, which is involved in reducing inflammation, tissue damage, and

236

pulmonary edema [33]. Ongoing clinical studies would provide information on the

237

effectiveness of ATV in preventing or mitigating these effects in patients with COVID-

238

19 [34, 35].

239

Additionally, in this study, Vero E6 cells were treated with ATV for 48 h after infection,

240

obtaining reduction of the SARS-CoV-2 titer at all evaluated concentrations.

241

Regarding this strategy, it has been reported that statins could affect steps, such as

242

replication, assembly and budding of infectious viral particles [15, 36-39]. This effect

243

could be explained because the stages after viral entry of enveloped virus also

244

depend on cholesterol biosynthetic pathways [20]. Specifically, it was reported that

245

HMG-CoA reductase is necessary to produce lipid droplets (LD) [39]. These cell

10
246

organelles have been recently proposed as hubs for SARS-CoV-2 genome

247

replication and viral particle assembly [40, 41]. According to the above, ATV

248

treatment could affect the replication and assembly stages of SARS-CoV-2 by

249

blocking LD production. Furthermore, ATV could be altering the envelope cholesterol

250

of the nascent viral particles, affecting their infectious capacity [21].

251

During the replicative cycle of Coronaviruses, Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease are

252

well-characterized drug targets. Spike protein participates in the binding to host cell

253

receptors and viral fusion to the cell membrane [42]. RdRp is involved in the

254

nucleotide-binding and catalysis of viral RNA replication [43], and 3CL protease is

255

the main viral protease, essential for processing polyproteins [19]. In addition to the

256

results obtained in vitro, our study predicted the interactions between ATV and these

257

SARS-CoV-2 proteins using molecular docking. ATV showed the highest binding

258

affinity with amino acids present at the active site of Spike (-8.5 Kcal/mol) followed

259

by 3CL protease (-7.5 Kcal/mol) and RdRp (-6.2 Kcal/mol). These binding energies

260

were even equal to or higher than previously reported candidates for COVID -19

261

treatment [44, 45].

262

It should be kept in mind that the best candidate for a drug against SARS-CoV-2 is

263

the molecule that can specifically bind to one of the targets mentioned above to form

264

a thermodynamically stable complex. As shown in Figure 4, complexes between

265

ATV and viral proteins were stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds, in which ATV can

266

act as an electron acceptor or a simultaneous donor and acceptor. Additionally,

267

hydrophobic interactions (π-alkyl interaction, π-Sulfure, π-π Stached) also

268

contributed to the stability of the complexes. Considering the above, ATV could be

269

a plausible candidate against SARS-CoV-2. In fact, an in silico study showed that

270

fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin may efficiently inhibit the SARS-

271

CoV-2 protease [19].

272
273

According to our in silico and in vitro results, it could be suggested as antiviral

274

mechanisms of ATV, the interaction with the Spike protein expressed on the SARS-

275

CoV-2 envelope, affecting the binding of the virus with the cell receptor or affecting

276

viral fusion. In addition, ATV could inhibit viral replication and proteolytic maturation

by blocking with SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins such as RdRp and 3CL

278

protease.

279
280

Finally, some studies have shown that statin therapy is associated with a 30%

281

reduction in fatal or severe disease in COVID-19 patients, a lower likelihood of

282

admission to the intensive care unit [22, 46] and an increased chance of

283

asymptomatic infection [22]. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the in

284

vivo antiviral activity of ATV against SARS-CoV-2 to allow a better understanding of

285

the benefits of ATV treatment in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, although the

286

available evidence suggests that this therapy could be effective.

287

Conclusion

288

Atorvastatin demonstrated potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, affecting

289

different stages of the replicative cycle of this virus, especially at phases after viral

290

entry. Due to low cost, availability, well-established safety and tolerability, and the

291

extensive clinical experience of atorvastatin, it could prove valuable in reducing

292

morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

293

Materials and methods

294

Preparation of compounds

295

ATV was purchased from Biogen Idec, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). It was solubilized in

296

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 100 mM.

297

Chloroquine (CQ) was bought in Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and it was

298

diluted to 15 mM in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA).

299

Heparin (positive inhibition control) was bought in B. Braun Melsungen AG and was

300

diluted to 1 mg/mL in PBS. The stock solutions of ATV and CQ were frozen at -80°C,

301

and Heparin was stored at 4 °C, until use.

302

Cells and virus

303

Vero E6 cells from Cercopithecus aethiops kidney were grown in Dulbecco's

304

Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% heat-

305

inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco),

306

1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco). The incubation conditions were 37°C, 5% CO2

307

atmosphere, and relative humidity. The cells were infected with a viral stock

308

produced from a Colombian isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Colombia/ANT-UdeA-

309

200325-01/2020) [47]. The virus was propagated on Vero E6 cells. All experimental

310

studies involving infectious SARS-CoV-2 were conducted within a biosafety level 3

311

laboratory.

312
313

Cytotoxicity assay

314

The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was

315

performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of ATV on Vero E6 cells. Briefly, cells were

316

seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0x104 cells/well in DMEM supplemented

317

with 2% FBS. Cultures were incubated for 24h at 37ºC and 5% CO2. Then,

318

150uL/well of double serial dilutions of ATV ranging from 7.8 to 250 µM were

319

prepared and added to each well. After 48h of incubation, the supernatants were

320

removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and 30uL/well of MTT (2 mg/mL) were

321

added. Plates were incubated for 2h at 37°C, with 5% CO 2, protected from light.

322

Then, 100uL/well of DMSO were added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Optical

323

density (OD) was recorded at 570 nm using a Multiskan GO spectrophotometer

324

(Thermo). Cell viability was calculated as a percentage of the OD of the treated

325

cultures in comparison with the untreated controls (viability control). Concentrations

326

that maintained more than 90% of cell viability after treatment were considered

327

nontoxic and were used for the antiviral evaluation. Chloroquine (from 6.3 to 100

328

µM) and Heparin (from 6.3 to 100 µg/mL) were used as positive control of viral

329

inhibition. For the MTT assay, two independent experiments with four replicates each

330

were performed (n=8).

331
332

Evaluation of the antiviral activity

333

The antiviral activity of ATV against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated initially through a

334

pre-post treatment. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates with a

335

density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well. Cells were incubated for 24h, at 37ºC, 5% CO2, and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433498; this version posted March 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

13
336

then pretreated with double dilutions of ATV (3.9 – 31.2 µM) for 1h prior to infection.

337

Treatment was then removed, and cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 stock at a

338

MOI of 0.01 in DMEM with 2% FBS. Cultures were incubated for 1h at 37°C. The

339

inoculum was removed and replaced newly by the same dilutions of the compound.

340

After 48h of treatment, the cell culture supernatants were harvested and stored at

341

−80 °C to be quantified by plaque assay. The supernatant of infected cells without

342

treatment was used as the untreated control.

343
344

Additionally, two antiviral strategies were done: pre-infection treatment (ATV was

345

added 1h before infection and was removed prior to viral infection) and post-infection

346

treatment (ATV was added 48h after infection). Chloroquine (from 12.5 to 100 µM)

347

and Heparin (12.5 -100 µg/mL) were included as positive controls for viral inhibition.

348

Two independent experiments with four replicates per experiment were performed

349

(n=8).

350
351

Viral quantification

352

The reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral titer in cell supernatants was quantified by plaque

353

assay. Briefly, tenfold serial dilutions of the supernatants obtained from the antiviral

354

assay were prepared in DMEM with 2% FBS and used to inoculate confluent

355

monolayers of Vero E6 cells into plates of 24 wells (1.0 × 105 cells/well). After 1h of

356

incubation, viral inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with 1.5%

357

carboxymethyl-cellulose in DMEM with 2% FBS. Then, the cultures were incubated

358

for 3 days at 37°C, with 5% CO2. After incubation, the monolayers were washed

359

twice with PBS, fixed with 4% Formaldehyde, and plaques were revealed with 1%

360

Crystal violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Plaques were counted and used to calculate

361

the number of plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL). The reduction in the viral

362

titer after treatment compared to the infection control (untreated infected cells) was

363

expressed as inhibition percentage. Two independent experiments with two

364

replicates per each were performed (n=4).

365
366

Molecular Docking

14
367

The simulation of molecular docking was used to measure the binding affinity of the

368

chemical functional groups of the ligands (Atorvastatin and Chloroquine) with amino

369

acids in the binding sites of three SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

370

The selected proteins were considered and obtained from the Protein Data Bank

371

(PDB) [48]. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (PDB: 6VYB) [49], RdRp (PDB: 6M71) [50]

372

and 3CL protease (PDB: 6M2N) [51] were selected. The protein structures were

373

subjected to preparation at Discovery Studio [52] and AutoDock Tools (ADT). The

374

ligands were drawn and optimized using Avogadro software [53] and ADT.

375

PrankWeb [54] was used to check the binding site coordinate and specify the amino

376

acids in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and pockets. Couplings were carried out using

377

Auto Dock vina version 4.2.6 [55], configuring a box with dimensions x: 24, y: 24, z:

378

24, this for each simulation carried out with the viral proteins using exhaustiveness

379

of 20. For 3CL protease (PDB:6M2N), coordinates x: -47.585, y: 1.135 z: -5.600;

380

RdRp (PDB:6M71), x:125.507, y:138.079, z: 130.430 and Spike protein

381

(PDB:6VYB), x:210.913 y:211.760, z: 185.437 coordinates were used. Then, we

382

used BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 16.1 to illustrate 2D docked visualization

383

analysis of the ligands with the amino acids inside the pockets [56].

384

Statistical analysis

385

All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA, USA) and presented as

386

mean ± SEM. Statistical differences were evaluated via Student’s t-test or Mann–

387

Whitney U test, according to the normality of the data. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was

388

considered significant. The median effective concentration (EC50) values represent

389

the concentration of each medicament that reduces viral titer by 50%. The CC50

390

values represent the concentration that cause 50% cytotoxicity. The corresponding

391

dose-response curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis using a

392

sigmoidal model. The calculated selectivity index (SI) represents the ratio of CC50

393

to EC50.
