Abstract
Coronaviruses (CoV) exploits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cells for
replication and in doing so, increases ER stress. evokes Unfolded Protein Response
(UPR) and possibly autophagy, which could all attribute to the pathophysiology of the viral
infections. To date, little is known about the roles of ER stress, UPR, and autophagy in
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we over-expressed the viral Spike (S) protein in cultured
HEK293T cells, as it has been shown that such protein is largely responsible for UPR
activation in other CoV-infected cells. We noticed, in the transfected cells, heightened
ER stress, activation of the PERK-eIF2α arm of the UPR, induction of autophagy and cell
death. When we treated the transfected cells with Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA),
4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA), Salubrinal, Trazadone hydrochloride, and Dibenzoylmethane
(DBM), we saw reduced the BiP/GRP78 levels, but only PBA and TUDCA could
significantly diminish the levels of peIF2α and autophagy expression.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially lethal, debilitating infectious
disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Like other
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped and positive-sense single-stranded RNA
virus with a large genome of ∼30 kb. Morphologically, coronaviruses are spherical or
pleomorphic in shape with a mean diameter of 80–120 nm [2]. They are characterized
by the large (20 nm) "club-like" projections on the surface, which are the heavily
glycosylated trimeric Spike (S) proteins [2, 3]. Coronavirus infection is initiated by the
binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface
receptors followed by fusion of the virus and cell membrane to release the viral genome
into the cell [4, 5]. The S protein comprises two functional subunits, S1 (bulb) for receptor
binding and S2 (stalk) for membrane fusion. The interaction between the host ACE2 cell
surface receptor and the S1 subunit is the central element of coronaviruses' tropism [6].
It replicates in the cytoplasm, and its life cycle is closely associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER).

The viral activities thus have a profound impact on ER functions.

Particularly, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ER to process its structural and nonstructural
proteins.
The accumulation of nascent and unfolded viral secretory and structural proteins
in the ER lumen can lead to ER stress and the downstream activation of multiple signaling
pathways [7]. To accommodate the biosynthetic encumbrance and capacity of the ER
for maintaining cellular homeostasis, the host cell activates Unfolded Protein Response
(UPR) to mitigate the ER stress. The UPR comprises three critical signaling pathways
initiated by localized stress sensors in ER, such as inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1),

activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) [8]. These
proteins send robust signals to the cytosol and nucleus to alleviate the burden of
misfolded protein and ensure successful ER protein homeostasis [9]. However, undue or
prolonged activation of UPR can also trigger autophagy and apoptosis [10], which could
play a significant role in the pathophysiology of viral infections. For SARS-CoV (the
coronavirus that caused SARS), it was reported that the Spike (S) protein, but not the
envelope (E), membrane (M), or the nucleocapsid (N) protein evokes UPR by the
transcriptional activation of GRP78 (BiP)/GRP94 and upregulation of the PERK pathway
with no effects on the other two arms of UPR [11-13]. Studies also confirmed UPRtriggered autophagy of the host cells in SARS-COV and MERS-COV infections [14, 15].
Based on the previous studies on other coronaviruses, it is reasonable to assume that
SARS-CoV-2 may induce autophagy via UPR activation in the infected cells. However,
emerging findings suggest that SARS-CoV and COVID-19 are also unique in many ways.
For instance, short-term loss of smell and taste during the infection cycle [16-19],
abnormal coagulation [20-22], silent hypoxia [23], and rash [24-26] in some patients with
the new COVID-19 are just some of the unique phenotypes that were rarely reported for
other coronaviral illnesses. Such unique phenotypes are telltale signs that it is premature
to assume everything we learned from other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, can be
applied in wholesale to SARS-CoV-2 without further investigations.
In this short communication, we aim to study the impact of the over-expression of
the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293T cells on ER stress manifestation and
its downstream effects, including autophagy. Puelles and coworkers recently reported
the SARS-CoV-2 tropism in human kidney by detecting the presence of ACE2 mRNA in

the kidney cells, as well as the enhanced expression of transmembrane serine protease
2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L (CTSL), which are also considered to facilitate SARSCoV-2 infection in multiple kidney-cell types from fetal development through adulthood
[27]. Indeed, acute kidney injury and dysfunctions are observed in a large proportion of
COVID-19 patients [28-31]. Hence the use of HEK293T cells in this study is of significant
clinical relevance. Our results showed that over-expression of the viral Spike protein in
the HEK293T cells activated UPR, which led to autophagy. Interestingly, the activated
UPR and the downstream autophagy induced could be substantially diminished by
selected UPR modulators, some approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for treating other diseases [32-35].

Addgene Inc. (Watertown, MA).

2.3. Transfection Studies

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.04.429769; this version posted February 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

HEK293T cells were plated onto six-well plates at a density of 4×105 cells per well
and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 overnight for transfection. A total amount of 5 μg DNA
per well was used for transient transfection with Lipofectamine® 3000 according to the
manufacturer's protocol.

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, culture media was

changed, and the cells were extracted and lysed using MPER lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.).

For the drug treatment, the UPR modulators at the indicated

concentrations were administered 4 hours post-transfection, and proteins from the cells
were extracted after 24 hours of treatment.

2.4. Western Blot Analysis
Cells overexpressing C9-tagged Spike protein and the drug treatment group were
harvested 24- and 28-hours post-transfection respectively. The cells were lysed with 0.1
ml of MPER buffer containing 1 mM NaVO3, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β‐
glycerol phosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml
leupeptin, (pH 7.5). 30 μg of total protein from cell lysate was separated on 12% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electro‐transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane (LI-COR). Antibodies described above were used to probe the membranes
according to the protocols the manufacturer provided. The signals were detected by
Infrared detection using an Odyssey scanner and analyzed by Image Studio software (LICOR).

2.5. Detection of Autophagy

For the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) mobility shift
assay, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-expressing cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed
with MPER buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against LC3B.
LC3-I is about 16 kD, and lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) is about 14 kD. The level of LC3 II
formation represents the autophagic activity [36].

2.6. Cell viability determination by MTT assay
Cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded
in 96-well plates at a density of 5×104/well. The cells were transfected with the plasmid,
pcDNA3.1-SARS2-Spike as described above. 24 hours post-transfection, MTT solution
(10 µl, 5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. Then,
the medium was replaced by 100 µl DMSO per well. The plate was gently shaken for 5
minutes to completely dissolve the precipitate and incubated for 30 minutes.

The

absorbance was measured at 560 nm using a microplate reader. Cell viability was
expressed as a percentage of the control.

3. Results

3.1. UPR is activated upon SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein overexpression in cultured
cells
To study the molecular events subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 Spike overexpression
in details, the plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was transiently transfected
into cultured HEK293T cells at different DNA concentrations. Manifestation of ER stress
was first demonstrated by evaluating the intracellular GRP78 levels in the transfected
cells. In cells over-expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the level of BiP/GRP78
was significantly higher compared to the untransfected control (Fig. 1a).

We next

investigated which specific UPR pathways are activated upon overexpression of the
Spike protein, with particular emphasis on the PERK arm. We found a significant increase
in the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in the transfected cells 24 hours post-transfection
(Fig. 1b). This further substantiated the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2- Spike protein
overexpression induces UPR in cultured cells.

3.2. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expression triggers autophagy response in cultured
cells
There is growing evidence to show that various host cellular responses, including
autophagy, innate immunity, and apoptosis, are affected or activated by coronaviruses
infection in vivo [37-39]. Among the many signaling pathways, the UPR and autophagy
are tightly interconnected and were shown to be essential for viral infection by multiple
previous studies. The implication of autophagy in coronavirus infection has attracted

substantial attention, due to the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003 [40-43].

To

investigate the involvement of autophagy in cells over-expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein, we evaluated the molecular markers of autophagy by monitoring levels of LC3-I
and LC3-II. We found that levels of LC3-II were increased in Spike protein-overexpressed
cells from 24 hours post-transfection (Fig. 2a), which is indicative for an activated
autophagy response that culminates in degradation cytoplasmic components in the
lysosomes. Collectively, these data illustrated that the PERK/eIF2α pathway of UPR is
activated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with the induction of autophagy. To assess the
cell viability by Spike protein overexpression, we conducted MTT assay 24 hours post
transfection in HEK293T cells. The results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
expression in HEK293T cells leads to cell death (Fig. 2b), which could be the
consequence of UPR-induced autophagy shown above.

3.3. UPR modulators reduced the UPR and autophagy in cultured cells
We next selected a few UPR modulators, some of them were approved by the FDA
to treat other diseases [32-35], in an attempt to modulate the level or ER stress and/or
the UPR in HEK293T cells over-expressing the viral Spike protein. HEK293T cells were
treated with 4-PBA, TUDCA, DBM, Trazadone, and Salubrinal at indicated concentrations
4 hours after plasmid encoding Spike protein transfection. The expressions of GRP78,
peIF2α, and LC3-II were examined at 24 hours post-transfection. Salubrinal, TUDCA,
PBA, and Trazadone significantly reduced the BIP/GRP78 levels in cells overexpressed
with viral Spike protein (Fig. 3a). In addition, we saw a significant reduction in peIF2α in
cells treated with the PBA and TUDCA (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, treatment with PBA and

TUDCA also resulted in a diminished level of the autophagy marker, LC3-II (14 kD) in the
cells over-expressing Spike at 24 hours (Fig. 3c). Altogether, we demonstrated the
cause-and-effect relationship between Spike protein-induced UPR and the subsequent
autophagy. We further analyzed the cell survival with UPR modulators and the data
confirmed the protective effects of TUDCA and PBA on cell survival (data not shown).

4. Discussion
Since February 2020, our world has been embroiled in a pandemic that is
unprecedent in scale. As of Dec 27th, 2020, there are more than 81 million people
worldwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 1.77 million deaths. This horrific loss of
human lives and the emotional toll inflicted on the loved ones of the deceased will
continue to rise until the spread of the disease is halted. At the same time, many survivors
who were fortunate to escape death suffer from a host of complications such lung fibrosis
or systemic organ damages that will take years to fully heal. In addition to the significant
mortality and morbidity caused by COVID-19, millions of jobs have been lost in the U.S.
alone since March. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of life-saving
therapies and preventive measures for COVID-19. But to accomplish these goals, we
must improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease.
Being a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 shares some similarities with other
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV. While our current knowledge on existing human
coronaviral diseases could offer important insights into SARS-CoV, emerging findings
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is also unique in many ways. Some of the phenotypes such
as short-term loss of smell and taste [16-19], abnormal coagulation [20-22] seen in many
patients with the new COVID-19 were rarely reported for other coronaviral illnesses.
Therefore, it is premature to assume the knowledge we gained from the studies of other
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, can be applied in entirety to SARS-CoV-2 without
additional research.
In this study we focused on the potential roles of ER stress, UPR and autophagy
in SARS-CoV-2 infection because such fundamental cellular processes have been shown

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.04.429769; this version posted February 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

to contribute to the pathophysiology of other diseases [44-47]. Also, in case of viral
infections, the role of ER during viral replication is well-documented, and the activation of
UPR has been reported in other coronaviruses-infected cells [48-51]. Therefore, the
induction of ER stress and UPR activation is a crucial factor in virus-host interaction and
can significantly influence the patient's antiviral response and [52-55].
To study the potential roles of UPR and autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infections, we
chose to overexpress the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in cultured HEK293T cells
because it has been shown in SAR-CoV that the S protein is the viral protein largely
responsible for activation of UPR [11-13]. Moreover, our focus on the HEK293T cells is
clinically relevant due to the high evidence of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID19. The mechanism(s) of renal injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully
elucidated, although ER stress/UPR has been implicated in renal injury induced by
ischemia-reperfusion and nephrotoxicity [56].
Here we showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expression in the HEK293T
cells led to up-regulation of BiP/GRP78 (Fig. 1) and the activation of the PERK branch of
the UPR pathway. These findings corroborated with the positive detection of ER stress
markers in the lung samples infected from COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia
[57]. Our data also agreed with the recent study that shows the SARS-CoV and MHVCoV infections activated PERK arm of UPR with subsequently increased phosphorylation
of eIF2α in the host cells [58-60]. It should be noted that the PERK pathway regulates
innate immunity by suppressing type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling [60]. Hence, it suggests
that UPR does play a role in attenuating IFN responses and innate immunity in
coronavirus-infected cells.

Several lines of evidence demonstrated that ER stress and the associated UPR
contributes to autophagy [61, 62]. However, the specific UPR pathway activated to
mediate autophagic activities, and whether cytoprotective autophagy or autophagic cell
death is induced upon ER stress, is not entirely clear and probably varies with the different
triggers of the UPR [63, 64].

Nonetheless, an essential step in UPR-induced

autophagosome formation is the phosphorylation of PERK/eIF2α [65].

Once

phosphorylated, eIF2α can induce the production of LC3-II from LC3-I to induce
autophagy [66]. To further investigate the potential roles of UPR and autophagy in SARSCoV-2, we examined the HEK293T cells over-expressing the Spike protein and found
that the LC3-II protein level was significantly upregulated with Spike protein expression,
leading to cell death (Fig. 2).

Furthermore, the changes in LC3-II observed were

significantly reversed by pretreatment with PBA and TUDCA (Fig. 3), indicating these
compounds could block the autophagy activation induced by over-expression of the Spike
protein. It is unclear why PBA and TUDCA are more effective than the other UPR
modulators we selected in this study.

However, PBA and TUDCA are chemical

chaperones [32, 67-71] and they could act to minimize UPR induction earlier on rather
than mitigating the downstream signaling pathway like Salubrinal and the others.
At present, clinical management of COVID-19 includes infection prevention (maskwearing, social distancing, vaccination)supportive care (supplemental oxygen and
mechanical ventilatory support) and limited and selective use of new anti-viral
therapeutics [Remdesivir (Veklury) [72], convalescent plasma therapy with mixed results
[73]. Dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid used to reduce inflammations in patient cells, has
shown some promises in reducing the risk of death for patients with more severe SARS-

CoV-2 infections, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear.
However, it has been shown that such glucocorticoid ameliorates ER stress in intestinal
secretory cells with protein misfolding in vitro and in vivo [74]. Therefore, our current
studies support the hypothesis that Dexamethasone might act through the modulation of
UPR in the infected cells of the COVID-19 patients. Given the potential side-effects of
prolonged use of glucocorticoids [75], one might want to consider the alternate use of
other UPR modulators such as PBA and TUDCA, in combination of other approved
antivirals.

5. Conclusions
We show for the first time that over-expression of the Spike (S) protein of SARSCoV-2 heightened ER Stress, activated UPR and caused autophagy in human HEK293T
cells in culture.

Such cellular responses were significantly diminished by specific

chemical chaperones PBA and TUDCA, but not other UPR modulators. These findings
render significant implications in the pathophysiology and the treatment of the viral
infection.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Upregulation of BiP/GRP78 in HEK293T cells over-expressing the SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-SARS2-Spike
and the protein levels of (a) BiP/GRP78 and (b) phosphorylated eIF2α (peIF2α) were
determined by Western blotting using specific antibodies 24 hours after transfection.
Quantified values of the specific protein abundance, which were normalized to the
abundance of GAPDH, were included at the right panel.
Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein over-expression triggers autophagy through
UPR. (a) HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-SARS2-Spike and the protein
levels LC3I and LC3-II were determined by Western blotting using anti-LC3B antibody
after 24 hours. Values were normalized to GAPDH. The ratio of LC3-II over GAPDH is
graphically represented on right. (b) Cell viability of the transfected cells was evaluated
by MTT assay and the quantified values were normalized to non-transfected controls.
Figure 3. UPR modulator treatment reduced levels of ER stress, UPR and
autophagy. HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-SARS2-Spike and 4 hours
after transfection, the cells were treated with the selected UPR modulators, Salubrinal
(50µM), 4-PBA (2mM), TUDCA (100µM), DBM (50µM) and Trazadone (50µM) for 24
hours. The protein levels of (a) BiP/GRP78, (b) phosphorylated eIF2α were determined
by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Values were normalized to that abundance
of GAPDH and were presented in the graphs on the right. (c) The protein levels LC3-II
with UPR modulator treatment were determined by Western blotting and normalized to
the abundance of GAPDH. The ratio of LC3 II over GAPDH is graphically represented
on right. * represents significant values compared to control. ** represents significant
values compared to HEK293T + SARS-CoV-2 Spike.
