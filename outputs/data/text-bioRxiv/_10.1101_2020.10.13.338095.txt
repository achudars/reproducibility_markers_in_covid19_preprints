Abstract. The need for high-affinity, SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is
critical in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as such reagents can have important
diagnostic, research, and therapeutic applications. Of greatest interest is the ~300 amino acid
receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit of the spike protein because of its key
interaction with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor present on many
cell types, especially lung epithelial cells. We report here the development and functional
characterization of 29 nanomolar-affinity mouse SARS-CoV-2 mAbs created by an accelerated
immunization and hybridoma screening process. Differing functions, including binding of diverse
protein epitopes, viral neutralization, impact on RBD-hACE2 binding, and immunohistochemical
staining of infected lung tissue, were correlated with variable gene usage and sequence.

Previous beta-coronavirus outbreaks from SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS-CoV (2008)
highlighted the value of novel antibody development in the rapid diagnosis of infection. Studies of
these earlier coronaviruses have informed current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, especially
concerning epitope motifs to target for virus neutralization. The ~300 amino acid receptor binding
domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit of the spike protein (Fig. 1a) is particularly significant, as it
contains the five contact residues (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501)1,2 previously shown to be
important for viral entry through interactions with the ACE2 receptor present on many cell types,
especially lung epithelial cells.3
In order to target this key polypeptide motif, we employed three different immunogens: a
commercially-available S1 domain (residues 1-681)4 with C-terminal histidine tag (designated HisS1), a commercial RBD sequence (residues 319-5414) fused at the C-terminus with a mouse
IgG1 Fc domain (designated mFc-RBD) (Fig 1a), and the noncovalent complex of mFc-RBD with
the PP7 bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP) engineered to express two sequential Fc-binding
Z-domains at 120 places on the VLP exterior surface (designated PP7zz).5 The last construct
provided a large (Fig. 1b) polyvalent display of receptor binding domains which we hoped would
productively engage immune cells and stimulate affinity maturation. The use of Fc-tagged
antigens is well known to increase antigen uptake and processing,6 including many examples with
viral antigens.7-11 While the virus-like particles used here were regarded as self-adjuvanting,12,13
the recombinant S1 and RBD proteins were usually augmented by TiterMax® Gold emulsion
adjuvant. Three sets of BALB/c mice were immunized with different accelerated vaccination
schedules (Fig. 1c), characterized by the use of only the recombinant His-S1 domain (Series 1),
a combination of mFc-RBD and PP7zz-displayed mFc-RBD immunogens beginning with mFcRBD (Series 2), and the VLP-displayed mFc-RBD with a final focusing boost of His-S1 (Series 3).
Individual mice or pairs of mice were chosen for maximum immune response as indicated by
serum antibody titer (Fig. 1d,e), rather than larger cohorts as would be necessary to determine
reproducibility and mechanistic trends.

superior in producing SARS-CoV-2 relevant antibodies (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2b). Each of
159 spike-binding mAbs selected by ELISA (157 from series 2, two from series 3) were further
characterized by semi-quantitative measurement of the binding strength of purified antibody or
hybridoma supernatant to soluble spike ectodomain using biolayer interferometry (BLI). Twelve
of these showed apparent avidity (reported as inverse of the adsorption constant, 1/Kads) better
than 1 nM and seventeen exhibited 1/Kads values between 1 and 10 nM (Fig. 2b, Table 1). Four
mAbs demonstrating markedly lower avidity by BLI (3D2, 3G6, 3B1, 3A6) were also carried
forward based on their demonstration of interesting or unusual properties as described below. All
of the 33 selected mAbs were IgG1 (k light chain), showed strong binding to both plated S1
subunit and spike ectodomain proteins, with overall larger signals for the latter under otherwise
identical ELISA conditions (Figure 2c, Table S1), and bound (in hybridoma supernatant)
inactivated (gamma-irradiated) SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 2d). The binding of serum, supernatants,
and antibodies to the ectodomain were not found to be consistently affected by storage or
incubation of the target protein at various temperatures, a concern raised by a recent report that
the structure of the ectodomain may be cold-sensitive (Extended Data Fig. 3).16

Variable-region sequencing showed three sets of identical mAbs: 3A2/3A7/3F5 (plus 3C6,
identical in the heavy chain but with some variations in the light chain, corresponding to modest
functional differences as described below); 3C4/3E4, and 3E1/3D3/9F2. Since the spatial
separation of cells in the 3D culture matrix usually far exceeded the resolution of the clone-picking
apparatus, it is unlikely that these sets of identical antibodies arose from the same hybridomas.
(The lone exception was 3E1 and 9F2, which originated from same clone sampled twice,
Extended Data Fig 2b.) Overall, the sequences of these high-affinity antibodies clustered into
several discreet groups based on heavy- or light-chain similarities (Fig. 3a, b). The most diverse
region in terms of length and amino acid composition proved to be heavy-chain CDR3 (Fig. 3c,
d), whereas greater diversity in gene usage was observed in the light chain (Fig. 3e). Gene
clustering was found to have relevance to functions described below. Thus, neutralization (mAb
groups 1-3) was associated primarily with the presence of IGHV1 and 8, and with IGKV1, 3, and
6; the large non-neutralizing Group 3 all shared the IGHV14-1 gene and about half also
incorporated IGKV6-32.
The diversity of epitopes recognized in binding the spike ectodomain was assessed by
pairwise competitive binding measurements using BLI (Fig. 3f). Low values indicated competition
of the two antibodies for identical, nearby, or allosterically-related epitopes, whereas large BLI
signals indicated non-competitive antibody association to different epitopes. Six major binding
groups were thereby identified (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 5-7). Some correlation was observed
with sequence overlap (as shown by the group labels in Fig. 3a, b), but a much greater degree of
correlation was observed to heavy-chain sequences and specific IGHV and IGKV combinations
(noted above and Extended Data Fig. 5), and to other functional assays.

The effect of the selected mAbs on the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to the human ACE2
receptor was determined by two in vitro methods: a direct binding measurement using both longer
(residues 1-740 = nearly the full polypeptide, referred to here as the “full-length” protein) and
shorter (residues 1-614, lacking the C-terminal collectrin-like domain, termed “truncated”) ACE2
constructs, and a split luciferase assay employing the truncated version (Fig. 4a, b). Ten mAbs
(3A2/3A7/3F5 = identical sequence, 3C6, 3B3, 3H6, 3H2, 3F2, 3G1, and 3A6) were found to
strongly inhibit RBD binding to both versions of hACE2 in dose-dependent fashion. Eight of these
antibodies (3A2/3A7/3F5, 3B3, 3H6, 3H2, 3F2, and 3G1) plus two others (3G7, 3C2, also
inhibitors of the RBD-ACE2 interaction but with a different profile, discussed below) exhibited
potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2-WA P#4, an early patient isolate,17 in cell culture (Figure 4c,
Extended Data Table S1). These results were supported by a second neutralization assay
employing a GFP-expressing variant of SARS-CoV-218 (Fig. 4c).

Twenty-one other mAbs exhibited significant levels of apparent RBD/hACE2 antibodydependent binding enhancement with the truncated ACE2 receptor, but 17 of these had little or
no effect on the interaction of RBD with full-length ACE2; the remaining 3 (3G7, 3C2, 3B4) showed
moderate levels of full-length ACE2-RBD binding inhibition (Fig. 4a, f). Since the truncated ACE2
lacks the receptor’s dimerization domain,19 it is clear that these antibodies recognize different
epitopes, and are distinct in functional class, from the strong inhibitors of RBD binding to both
hACE2 constructs.
The in vitro split luciferase functional assay mirrored these binding results with several
interesting exceptions. Thus, 3H6, 3G7, and 3C2 had strong effects on RBD-ACE2 direct binding
but little influence on split luciferase readout; contrariwise, 3A1 and 5A1 inhibited the SARS-2 split
luciferase reporter but did not inhibit direct binding. As described below, these functional oddities
were matched by independently observed differences in competitive epitope binding. When the
RBD component of the split luciferase assay was changed to the SARS-CoV-1 sequence, all but
one strongly neutralizing antibody was shown to be selective for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4f). [One
neutralizer (3H6) had no effect on the split luciferase assay, and one strong ACE2 binding inhibitor
(3A6) was not neutralizing. The latter, interestingly, was the only mAb to inhibit RBD binding to
both CoV-1 and CoV-2 ACE2 sequences and also had low overall binding affinity for the
recombinant spike ectodomain protein.] In contrast, of the 17 antibodies eliciting a strengthened
split luciferase signal, 14 gave roughly comparable results for both SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2, while
only three were selective for each variant (3B6, 3F6, and 3F4 for CoV-2; 3D1, 3D2, and 3B1 for
CoV-1).

Based on sequence variations and epitope binning experiments (Fig 3), we conclude that the
groups [3A2/3A7/3F5, 3C6, 3B3], [3G7, 3C2], [3H6], and [3H2, 3F2] recognize at least four
different epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, the general target for neutralizing
human antibodies as well.23 Four mAbs (3B1, 3D2, 3F4, 3D1) were found to bind to a detectable
degree to a synthetic biotinylated 15-mer peptide of the receptor binding motif covering amino
acids 486-501 (Fig. 4d), which contains four out of five key RBD-hACE2 contact residues.1,2 None
of these four antibodies are strongly neutralizing, suggesting that the linear (and presumably
unstructured) peptide is not presented by the infectious virus.
Such a peptide motif, however, can apparently be presented when the virion is degraded.
Among our high-affinity mAb panel, we identified two (3D2 and 3D7) from a subset of 13 (including
3G7, 3F2, 5A1, 3A1, 3F1, 3B1, 3A6, 3G6) that preferentially stained SARS-CoV-2 viral spike
protein in lung tissue from infected patients. These samples underwent standard fixation and
subsequent heat treatment to expose antigen, likely in denatured form, at the surface (Fig. 4e).
As noted above, these clones have functional characteristics opposite to those desired of a
therapeutic molecule: they exhibited little or no detectable neutralization activity and enhanced
binding of spike protein to the truncated ACE2 receptor. Heat-inactivated virions obtained from
ATCC were recognized by ELISA by only 3H2 (Extended Data Fig. 4c) among the mAbs
described here.
Recognition of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2-WA virions was also not uniform among mAbs
having roughly equal avidities for the recombinant spike ectodomain protein, as illustrated by
ELISA analysis of 15 antibodies in Fig. 4g. Representative dose-response analysis showed that,
while both 3H2 and 3A2 were equivalently potent in in vitro neutralization, the former mAb
generated significantly larger ELISA signals at equivalent concentrations (Fig. 4h). This resulted
in a limit of detection of gamma-inactivated particles using 3H2 that was lower by an order of
magnitude (Fig. 4i). While it is sometimes assumed that gamma-irradiation does not alter viral
surface antigens,24 this is not at all certain.25 We are aware of no studies of this question for
coronavirus.
In summary, immunization using Fc-domain (and virus-like particle assisted) display of the
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, followed by rapid parallel hybridoma production and
screening, provided a panel of binding agents with diverse and useful functions in the context of
virus binding and infectivity. This approach is complementary to that of teams led by Crowe and
Walker, who isolated large panels of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs from B cells from infected
patients.26,27 As in those reports, a large number (here, 29 out of 33) anti-SARS-CoV-2
monoclonal antibodies were obtained exhibiting low-nanomolar or better avidity for the target

spike ectodomain, consistent with many other reports validating this protein as a viable
immunological target. We identified three groups of neutralizing antibodies recognizing distinct
epitopes on the RBD motif as inferred from sequence and competitive binding experiments (Fig.
3e, f; Extended Data Fig. 6, 7). A fourth group, the largest in number, were not strongly
neutralizing and had either no effect on, or enhanced in one assay, the recognition of human
ACE2 by the recombinant RBD. A fifth functional group stained fixed and heat-treated lung tissue
from infected COVID-19 patients. Each functional class was also largely distinctive in its epitope
recognition and in its sequence.
Methods
General. Monoclonal antibody sequencing and functional tests were performed by blinded
researchers. All data were processed and graphed using GraphPad Prism v.8.
Recombinant ectodomain protein. We employed the stabilized prefusion spike construct of Graham
and McLellan (designated “s2p” by those investigators, and “recombinant spike ecto” (r-spike ecto)
here.15 This polypeptide lacks the transmembrane sequence of the natural virus, has a mutated furin
cleavage site (RRAR to GSAS) to block proteolytic processing, and is capped at the C-terminus with
a His8 tag followed by two Strep-Tag® II sequences (WSHPQFEK) bridged by a flexible connector
(GGGSGGGGSGGSA).
Expression and purification of His-tagged recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and ectodomain
proteins. Expi293FTM cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured on an orbital shaker platform
(~125 rpm) in Expi-293 expression medium at 37°C with 8% CO2. On the day of transient transfection,
400 µg of pCDNA3.1-SARS-CoV2-S1 recombinant plasmid DNA (provided by Dr. Lisa Mills at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) was mixed with ExpiFectamineTM 293 reagent in OptiMEMTM I reduced serum medium and transfected into 400 mL of Expi293F cells following the
manufacturer’s instructions. About 20 h post-transfection, ExpiFectamineTM

293 Transfection

Enhancer 1 and Enhancer 2 were added to the flask containing transfected cells. On day 6 posttransfection, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant
was filtered through a 0.22-µM filter and loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap FF crude column (GE) for
purification. The column was washed with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole,
pH 7.5). His-tagged SARS-CoV-S1 recombinant protein was then eluted with buffer B (20 mM TrisHCl, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) and dialyzed into 0.01M PBS, pH 7.4.28 To produce
the ectodomain protein, an Expi293FTM stable cell line was constructed to express r-spike ecto. Six
liters of these cells were seeded at 5x105 cells per mL into flasks and cultured at 37°C and 8% CO2
with orbital shaking (~125 rpm). After 7 days of incubation, cells were harvested and centrifuged at

5000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through 0.22-µM filter and loaded onto 5
mL HisTrap FF crude column (GE) for purification as described above.
Immunizations, Antigens, and B cell extraction. Six-week old female pathogen-free BALB/c mice
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and housed in the Physiological
Research Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology. All animal protocols and procedures were
approved by the Georgia Tech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were immunized
subcutaneously on both sides of lower anterior abdomen on day 0 with similar boost inoculations
performed on days 14 and 27. For primary or secondary immunizations with recombinant SARS-CoV2 protein, a sterile 0.1 mL solution in PBS buffer containing 7.5-15 µg protein was mixed with an
equivalent volume of emulsified Titermax Gold ® adjuvant immediately prior to administration. Viruslike particle display of mouse Fc-tagged RBD protein (Sino Biological) was accomplished using the
T=4 VLP composed of 120 copies of a covalent dimer version of the PP7 coat protein with the ZZdomain fused to the C-terminus, produced as previously described.5 This particle was incubated with
mFc-antigen in a stoichiometric ratio of 3 ZZ-domains to 1 Fc domain (40 antigen molecules per
particle) for 2 h at 37°C just prior to immunization. Complexation of Fc-antigen to the VLP was
confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DynaPro, Wyatt Technology) on representative samples
showing the expected increase in nanoparticle hydrodynamic radius. Blood was collected by
submandibular bleeds on days 0 (pre-immunization), 14, 21, and 30 (terminal). Body mass was
measured over time as a metric of general health and did not vary relative to vehicle-treated control
mice. Mice selected for high anti-ectodomain serum antibody levels were sacrificed by CO2
asphyxiation on day 30 followed by splenectomy for B cell extraction. B cells were perfused from
harvested spleens by aspirating 20 mL of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Media (IMDM) through tissue
using 10-mL syringes and 22-gauge needles.
Hybridoma fusion. SP2-IL6 myelomas (ATCC) cells were cultured in IMDM supplemented with
antibiotics and 10% Low IgG FBS (Gibco). B-cells isolated from selected immunized BALB/c mice
were incubated with 5 mL lysis buffer on ice for 5 minutes. After washing with 0.01M PBS, B cells
were resuspended into serum free base IMDM and counted using a Cellometer K2 Fluorescent
Viability Cell Counter (Nexcelom). The SP2 cells were then mixed with B cells in 1:1 ratio and
centrifuged at 400 x g for 7 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL serum-free base IMDM
followed by addition of 50 µL of Pronase solution (10 mg/mL) for 3 min at room temperature. In this
reaction, the total cell number varied between 5 x 107 and 2 x 108. 0.5 mL low IgG FBS was added to
quench the reaction. After washing twice with Cytofusion medium C (BTX) by centrifugation at 400 x
g for 7 minutes, the cells were resuspended in 10 mL Cytofusion medium C and loaded into a 10 mL
flatpack chamber (BTX). Electrofusion using an ECM 2001 Electro Cell Manipulator with 630B Safety
Stand (BTX) was performed under automatic mode for 5 minutes at a field strength of 3000 V/cm. The

cells were then mixed with 40 mL pre-warmed medium and incubated in a 37°C water bath for 30
minutes before transferring into a T75 flask and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.
Development of SARS2 anti-Spike mAbs.

Fused hybridoma cells were plated into semi-solid

methylcellulose-based media containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine, and CloneDetect
reagent. Automated selection using a ClonePix II instrument (Molecular Devices) isolated 350 IgGpositive colonies. Undiluted hybridoma supernatant from confluent wells was screened against 0.5
µg/mL r-spike ecto and 1 µg/mL His-S1 by indirect ELISA. Positive reactivity was scored if the average
OD was greater than 2.0, a value far greater than negative-control signals obtained under the same
conditions. In each plate run, mouse sera from the terminal bleed was included as a positive
control. IgG-producing clones were cultured in static T-75s in IMDM with antibiotics and 10% Low IgG
FBS at 37°C with 5% CO2. mAbs were purified by Protein G Sepharose Fast Flow and eluted at >0.2
mg/mL in 100 mM glycine/150 mM NaCl (pH 2.8) and neutralized with 200 mM Tris (pH 8.0).
Antibodies were isotyped using the Rapid ELISA Mouse mAbs Isotyping Kit (ThermoFisher Pierce)
with anti-mouse heavy chain capture antibody (anti-IgG1, IgG2a, IgGb, IgG3, IgA and IgM) or antimouse light chain (kappa or lambda) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Superdex-200 size-exclusion
chromatography.

Aliquots of mAbs were stored at 4°C until use. Protein concentrations were

determined by NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer at 280 nm.
Antibody sequencing. Hybridoma clones expressing anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies were
propagated in IMDM supplemented with antibiotics and 10% Low IgG FBS in static culture at 37°C
with 5% CO2. 3-5 x 106 Cells from each clone were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 min
and washed once in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4). Total RNA was extracted by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.29 RNA reverse transcription and first strand cDNA
synthesis were carried out using chain-specific reverse primers30 with ProtoScript® II First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB). The resulting cDNA was used as template for preparing the sequencing
library using 5’ multiplex PCR as previously described.31 The PCR products corresponding to the
library amplification were purified on BluePippin with size cutoff around 500 bp. The gel purified
amplification products were then indexed, purified, quantified, and validated according to instructions
provided by the manufacturer (Illumina). The Illumina Version 3 (2 x 300 bp) sequencing kit was used
to sequence the library, and sequencing data were processed using the MiXCR tool.32
ELISA. Anti-spike immune responses, antigen specificity of immunized mouse sera, and antigen
recognition of hybridoma supernatants were analyzed by ELISA. His-S1 or ecto-spike proteins were
plated on half-area high-binding 96-well polystyrene plates (Corning) at 1 µg/mL or 0.5 µg/mL,
respectively, in PBS overnight at 4°C. Unbound protein was washed away with PBST (1x PBS with
0.5% Tween) followed by blocking with 1% casein (w/v) in PBS (VWR International, Radnor, PA) for
2 h at room temperature with mild shaking (55 rpm). Serum or supernatant samples were then

incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with shaking, followed by washing with PBST. For serum titers,
six dilutions of sera in blocking buffer were plated; for supernatant specificity and epitope mapping
experiments, undiluted hybridoma supernatant was plated. Secondary reporter goat anti-mouse IgG
HRP (Southern Biotech) was diluted (1:2500) in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with shaking, followed by washing. Plates were developed by adding 1-step Ultra TMB
(Fisher Scientific) for 30 s (serum) or 90 s (supernatant), followed by quenching with 2N H2SO4.
Absorbance (450 nm) was measured by platereader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Titers were calculated by sigmoidal non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism v.8 analysis with log
10 serum dilution plotted against absorbance at 450 nm.
Spike detection sensitivity and specificity by indirect ELISA. Recombinant spike S1 or
ectodomain proteins were plated at 0.5 ug/mL in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.0) in 96-well highbinding microtiter plates overnight at 4°C. The wells were washed with PBST, treated with blocking
buffer (2% BSA in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with PBST. Hybridoma supernatant
or mAb (1 µg/ml) in blocking buffer was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times
with PBST, and incubated with HRP-Goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) in blocking buffer (1 h, room
temperature). After washing 3x with PBST, TMB substrate (100 µL, A and B, Sera Care) was added,
followed after 5 min by 100 µL of stop solution (Sera Care). Absorbance was monitored at 450 nm on
a Spectramax 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Label-Free binding and kinetic studies. Label-free analysis of binding by biolayer interferometry
(BLI) was performed on an Octet Red96 (Forte Bio) at 30°C in kinetics buffer (PBS, 0.05% BSA, 0.02%
Tween20). Biosensors were equilibrated for 10 min in kinetics buffer and microplates filled with 200
µL of sample in kinetic buffer and agitated at 1000 rpm. For kinetic analysis of mAbs, anti-mouse Fc
(AMC) biosensors were loaded with IgG (1-2 µg/mL) giving a loading response of 0.5-0.8 ± 0.15 nm
among 8 sensors. The loaded sensors were exposed to r-spike ecto protein (15 µg/mL) with subtracted
buffer reference for 1000 s and buffer dissociated for 2000 s in two independent assays (averaged
values with R2>0.98). Data were analyzed in Octet Data Analysis 9.0. To deduce a direct binding
affinity via the kinetic rate constants (1/Kads = kdis/kon, where 1/Kads = apparent equilibrium dissociation
constant, kon = association rate constant, and koff = dissociation rate constant) the buffer-subtracted
Octet data were fit locally (relative binding) or globally (kinetic analysis) to a simple 1:1 Langmuir
model. Experiments performed on a subset of samples by immobilizing r-spike ecto (15 µg/mL) onto
anti-His tag (HIS2) sensors gave similar results but with poorer-quality fits and so are not reported.
Typical loading levels were 0.8-1.0 ± 0.15 nm within a row of eight tips, with standard deviation within
the instrument noise. Purified IgG (100 nM) was associated for 150 s followed by dissociation in buffer
for 200 s in two independent assays (R2>0.92) using a non-specific IgG reference.

Epitope binning by BLI. Epitope binning was performed in tandem format using an Octet Red 96
instrument. Recombinant spike ecto protein in kinetics buffer was immobilized onto streptavidin (SA)
biosensors (by virtue of the protein’s dual Strep-Tag® II peptides, protein concentration 10 µg/mL).
Each epitope binning experiment consisted of a baseline measurement in kinetics buffer for 60 s;
loading of r-spike ecto for 500 s; a second baseline in kinetics buffer for 60 s; association of the
“primary” mAb for 400 s; dissociation in kinetics buffer for 300 s; association of the competing
(“secondary”) mAb for 300 s; and a second dissociation in kinetics buffer for 200 s with shaking at
1000 rpm at 30°C. Binding response of the secondary mAb was measured against the saturating
mAb. All mAb solutions were prepared in kinetics buffer. All of the data were analyzed using ForteBio
Octet Data Analysis software version 10.0.
Mix-and-read (split luciferase) RBD/ACE2 interaction assay. The ability of monoclonal antibodies
to inhibit RBD/ACE2 interaction was quantified in a purpose-built homogeneous biochemical assay.
Human codon optimized ACE2 (residues 1-615, NM_001371415) was fused to a C-terminal extension
composed of a 5-residue linker, 8xHis, 16-residue linker and LgBit of Promega NanoBit split luciferase
system. Receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-1 strain Urbani (AY278741, spike residues 1-14 and
306-527) and SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947, spike residues 1-14 and 319-541) were
fused at their C-termini to identical linkers and tag sequence with SmBit in place of the LgBit. These
constructs were cloned into the episomal vector EEV600A-1 (System Biosciences) into which a
puromycin resistance cassette was added so that cell pools expressing the proteins could be rapidly
selected, if desired. Human Expi293 cells (Thermo Scientific) were transfected with these constructs
using FectoPro (PolyPlus Transfection) and the proteins purified from culture supernatants by
immobilized metal affinity chromatography using HisTrap Excel nickel columns (Cytiva). Purified
proteins were dialyzed in PBS and stored at -80° C. The RBD/ACE2 assays were conducted 96-well
plates with low-protein binding surface and 0.02% BSA in PBS (w/v) as the diluent. In the first step,
3.2 ng of RBD-SmBit proteins in 20 µL were mixed with 20 µL mAb dilution so that the mAb was at
20X molar excess over the RBD-SmBit. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, ACE2-LgBit was
added in volume of 20 µL so that it was in 10X molar excess over the RBD-SmBit. After another 1 h
incubation at RT, 60 µL of Promega NanoGlo reagent was added and luminescence quantified 10 min
later with no-antibody wells serving as the baseline. The data represents average results from
repeated, independent experiments (n = 2-7).
BLI Assay of RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition. The results of the mix-and-read RBD/ACE2 interaction
assay were corroborated by BLI. Samples comprised of a 1.4:1 molar ratio of mAbs (10 µg/mL) to
mouse Fc-RBD (2.5 µg/mL, Sino Biological, 51.5 kDa) were complexed in kinetics buffer for 30 min at
room temperature. The experiment was carried out at 30°C with agitation at 1000 rpm on an Octet
Red 96 or an Octet KQe (Forte Bio). His2 biosensors were hydrated for 10 min in kinetics buffer, then

loaded for 300 s with 2.5 µg/mL ACE2-His (residues 1 – 740) (Sino Biological) or truncated ACE2
(described above for the mix-and-read assay) in kinetics buffer. Pre-complexed samples were then
associated for 300 s followed by dissociation in kinetics buffer for 300 s. Binding responses of mouse
Fc-RBD to ACE2-His were measured with and without mAb present and were analyzed with Octet
Data Analysis v. 9.0.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung samples were obtained from a
previously confirmed fatal COVID-19 case at Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch, CDC, Atlanta. All
samples and associated medical and autopsy records were provided in the context of diagnostic
consultation, a routine public health service provided by CDC. As such, institutional review was not
required for the testing described in this article. Cytoplasmic staining patterns were analyzed and
compared with a commercial rabbit polyclonal SARS nucleocapsid antibody (Novus Biological) at
1:100 dilution, previously validated and used as a primary SARS-COV-2 IHC diagnostic assay.22
Immunohistochemical assays were performed using an indirect immunoalkaline phosphatase
detection with the Mach 4 AP Polymer system (Biocare Medical). Briefly, 4 μm tissue sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol solutions. Heat-induced epitope
retrieval was performed using a citrate-based buffer and Decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical).
Primary antibody was applied at 1:100 for 30 min. The antibody-polymer conjugate was visualized by
applying Permanent Red Chromogen to tissue sections for 30 min (CellMarque, MilliporeSigma).
Slides were counterstained in Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Polyscientific), blued in lithium carbonate
(Polysciences, Inc.) and cover slipped with aqueous mounting medium (Polysciences, Inc.)
Of the 13 antibodies tested, immunohistochemical staining of SARS-CoV-2 case control
material was detected for two (1-3D2 and 1-3D7). The staining quality of each antibody was reliable
and generally similar to the commercial polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody used as a
positive control, the monoclonals showing similar staining intensity but fewer positive cells.
Microneutralization assays. All SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays (MNT) were performed
following biosafety level-3 precautions.
Using SARS-CoV-2 wild type isolate. The WA strain of SARS-CoV-217 was employed using a modified
version of a previously established protocol.33 Vero cell suspension (ATCC CCL-81) was prepared at
2.2 – 2.5 × 105 cells/mL in DMEM (Thermo Fisher, catalog 11965118) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
defined, Hyclone catalog SH30070.03, heat-inactivated 56°C for 30 min) + 2X antibiotic-antimycotic
(Thermo Fisher catalog 15240062) + 2X penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher catalog 15140122)
immediately before use. Purified monoclonal antibodies (50 µg/mL in serum-free DMEM) were 2-fold
serial diluted in serum-free DMEM in a 96-well flat bottom plate, from 50 µg/mL to a 0.024 µg/mL, in
triplicate, to a final volume of 50 µL/well. SARS-CoV-2 was diluted to a final working dilution of 700
TCID50/mL in serum free DMEM, and 50 µL was added to each well, giving final antibody

concentrations ranging from 25 to 0.012 µg/mL. After 30 min incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2, 100 µL
of Vero cells in suspension were added to each well, for a final concentration of 2.2 – 2.5 × 104
cells/well. After 5 days further incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a level-3 biosafety cabinet, media
was aspirated from the wells, and 150 µL crystal violet fixative (0.15% crystal violet, 2.5% ethanol,
11% formaldehyde, 50% PBS, 0.01M pH 7.4) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20
min at room temperature. The fixative was aspirated, plates were washed with 200 µL/well distilled
water and scored. The endpoint concentration at which antibodies were determined to be neutralizing
for SARS-CoV-2 infection was the lowest concentration of antibody at which 3 replicate wells were
protected against virus infection.
Using SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus. Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were suspended to a density of
2.2 x 105 cells/mL in DMEM (Thermo Fisher catalog 11965118) with 10% FBS (Hyclone catalog
SH30406.02HI) and 100 µL of the cell suspension was seeded into each well on flat-bottom 96-well
cell culture plates. The plates were incubated at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 16-24 h to obtain a monolayer
of confluent cells. Purified monoclonal antibody stock at a concentration of approximately 1mg/mL was
1:2 serially diluted in infection media (DMEM with 2% FBS and 1X penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo
Fisher catalog 15140122) starting at 1:20 and ending at a dilution of 1:20,480. Dilutions were done
with a final volume of 60 µL/well in quadruplicate rows using round-bottom 96-well plates.
Recombinant mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus icSARS-CoV-2-mNG18 was diluted to 2,000
TCID50/mL in infection media and an equal volume (60 µL) of the diluted virus was added to each well
on the antibody dilution plates. Following 60 min incubation at room temperature, 100 µL of the virusantibody mixture from each well was transferred to corresponding wells on the cell plates, from which
the original cell culture media were decanted right before the transfer. After 2 days of incubation at 37
o

C with 5% CO2, plates were scanned with the EVOS FL Auto Cell Imaging System to identify cells

emitting green fluorescence. The endpoint dilution at which antibodies were determined to be
neutralizing was the highest dilution of antibody at which more than half of the wells were absent of
green fluorescence.
