Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat, and host immunity remains the main
mechanism of protection against the disease. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2
is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral
entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS)
located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus.
However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear
how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD
mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed
to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID19-positive patients. We found that only a
small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of
different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the
RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased
selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas
ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such
antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially
bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results
suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein,
which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a
worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19. As of August 1st 2020, over 17
million cases have been confirmed globally, leading to 675,060 deaths
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). A
number of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 are currently in clinical trials, yet no agents or
vaccines have been approved by the government agencies. As such, the host immune
responses remain the main source of protection against the virus. Still many aspects of the
immune responses and the strategies employed by the virus to evade them are unknown.
The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mediated by a virus-surface spike
glycoprotein that forms a trimer (Fig.1A) [1, 2]. The spike protein is composed of two subunits,
S1 and S2. The S1 subunit interacts with the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2), a crucial step in cell attachment, whereas the S2 subunit plays a role in the fusion of
the viral and cellular membrane, a crucial step in cell entry [2, 3]. The receptor binding domain
(RBD) in the S1 subunit is the domain that binds ACE2 with an affinity in the low nanomolar
range [2, 4, 5], and this interaction initiates the conformational change of the spike protein from
the pre-fusion state to the post-fusion state. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the RBD of the spike protein can compete with the RBDACE2 interaction, serving as neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, such antibodies isolated from
COVID-19 patients showed potent neutralization effects and are being developed as
therapeutics [6-9]. Thus, eliciting antibodies targeting the ACE2IS from the immune system
should be critical for controlling and preventing COVID-19.
A region of an antigen is considered immunogenic if it is readily recognized by
antibodies, although many aspects in the immune responses of the host can influence the
overall immunogenicity. From the viewpoint of viral evolution, there should be a strong selective
pressure favoring the protection of a region that is crucial for the viral life-cycle from host
immune attacks. For example, the CD4-binding site of the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein is
situated in a deep cleft heavily protected by glycosylation [10]. However, studies revealed that
the spike proteins of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not
densely glycosylated, unlike HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza
hemagglutinin envelop [11, 12]. In particular, the ACE2IS in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
appears not highly protected with glycosylation [12]. Intriguingly, a number of studies of SARSCoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients have revealed that, although most
convalescent plasmas from COVID-19 patients contain antibodies targeting the spike protein

and the RBD, they have low neutralization activity [13-15]. Thus, analysis of the immunogenic
surfaces, or the “immunogenicity landscape”, of the spike protein and the RBD in terms of
eliciting high-affinity antibodies should provide important insights into the antibody response to
COVID-19 as well as vaccine design, because the spike protein and the RBD are the antigens
in most first-generation vaccines for COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draftlandscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines).
In this study, to define immunogenic properties of epitopes within the spike protein, we
performed in vitro selection of a synthetic human antibody library against the spike protein and
the RBD. We designed an RBD mutant that abolished binding of the RBD to ACE2, and utilized
it as a tool for epitope analysis of convalescent sera and in antibody discovery. Our results
suggest that the ACE2IS in the RBD is a minimally immunogenic surface within the spike
protein, and we discuss the molecular underpinning of this finding and its implications for
vaccine design.
Results and Discussion
Design of an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS
To develop a tool for facilitating the analysis of ACE2IS-binding antibodies, we designed
an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS. The ACE2IS in the RBD is mainly composed of three
contact regions, CR1, CR2 and CR3 (Fig.1B) [16]. From each contact region, we chose a key
residue (N487, Q493 and N501) that forms hydrogen bond(s) with residues in ACE2, and
mutated them to Lys residues to disrupt both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions (Fig.
1B, Supplementary Fig.1). We term this mutant as RBD-T hereafter. Binding analysis using
ACE2-expressing cells showed that the RBD bound to ACE2 with high affinity (KD ~ 20nM),
consistent with previous reports [1, 2, 5], and that RBD-T nearly completely lost binding to ACE2
(Fig. 1C). Likewise, these mutations should disrupt antibody binding to the ACE2IS. A binding
assay using the RBD and RBD-T is a straightforward method to determine whether antibodies
recognize the ACE2IS or not, and thus we utilized the RBD-T as an epitope analysis tool for
anti-RBD antibodies.
Analysis of convalescent serum using RBD-T
To characterize the prevalence of antibody response to the ACE2IS in COVID-19
patients, we performed binding analysis of 94 convalescent serum samples [14] from healthcare
workers who showed PCR-positivity for COVID-19. In this experiment, we measured the IgG
binding to the RBD in the absence and presence of excess soluble RBD-T competitor.

Strikingly, more than 60% of the signal was lost in the presence of the RBD-T competitor in 80%
of the serum samples, indicating that the majority of the antibodies that bound to the RBD in
convalescent sera did not target the ACE2IS (Fig. 2A and B). These data suggest that the
ACE2IS is not a highly immunogenic epitope within the RBD.
Unbiased antibody selection for the spike protein and the RBD
To investigate the immunogenicity landscape of the spike protein and the RBD, we
performed in vitro selection of a human antibody phage-display library against the spike protein
and the RBD. The recovery of antibody clones in the in vitro selection primarily depends on the
strength of binding to the antigen, and thus analyzing specificity and epitopes of enriched
antibodies enables us to determine the immunogenicity landscape of the antigens from the point
of the direct antibody-antigen interaction under well-define conditions. We used a synthetic
antibody library that is constructed based on both intrinsic amino acid bias in immune
repertoires and knowledge of structures and functions of naturally occurring antibodies [17, 18].
This, and closely related antibody libraries, have generated numerous high-affinity antibodies to
diverse proteins [19].
We first performed selection for antibodies against the spike protein and the RBD in an
unbiased manner, that is, we did not incorporate steps that might bias the recovery of antibodies
binding to different epitopes (Fig. 3A). Clones from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection were
randomly picked, and their sequences and binding specificity were characterized in the phagedisplay format. We identified 95 unique clones out of 120 randomly picked colonies from the
spike selection campaign (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, 89% of the clones bound to the spike protein but
not the RBD or RBD-T (“Spike only” binders), indicating that these antibodies recognize the
surfaces of the spike protein outside the RBD or the surfaces that partially consists of the RBD
(Fig. 3A and B). Only 11% of the clones showed ability to bind to the spike protein as well as the
RBD and RBD-T (“Spike+RBD” binders), and antibodies binding to the ACE2IS, as judged by
the ability to bind to the RBD but not to RBD-T, were not identified from this selection. These
results suggest that the RBD is not a highly immunogenic region of the spike protein.
From the RBD selection campaign, we identified 23 unique clones out of 24 randomly
picked colonies (Fig. 3A). Although the ACE2IS is highly exposed on the RBD, antibodies
targeting the ACE2IS were not identified from this selection. Interestingly, 83% of the clones
showed binding to the RBD and RBD-T, but not to the spike protein (“RBD only” binders) (Fig.
3A and B). These data indicate that their epitopes are exposed when the RBD exists in isolation
or after dissociation of the S1 subunit from the spike protein, but are not exposed when the RBD

is a part of the fully assembled spike trimer. These results suggest that, if the RBD is used as an
antigen for vaccination, antibodies targeting those epitopes of the RBD that are not exposed in
the native spike protein can dominate in the initial immune response. Together, our data
suggest that isolated RBD contains highly immunogenic epitopes that are inaccessible in the
context of the fully assembled spike protein.
Biased antibody selection readily identifies ACE2IS-targeting antibodies
Because the unbiased RBD selection campaign enriched antibodies that do not bind to
the spike protein, we next performed antibody selection using both RBD and spike protein as
the antigens (Fig. 3A) to intentionally enrich for clones that cross-react with both antigens. We
identified 35 unique antibodies among 120 randomly chosen clones. A majority of clones bound
to both RBD and spike protein (“Spike + RBD” binders), indicating that RBD contains epitopes
that can be readily recognized in the context of the fully assembled spike protein (Fig. 3A and
B). We note that antibodies that bound outside the RBD (“Spike only” binders) and to epitopes
on the RBD that are inaccessible in the spike protein (“RBD only” binders) were still recovered,
despite the use of a strong selection bias against such clones. We identified clones that bound
to both RBD and spike protein but not RBD-T, indicating that they recognize the ACE2IS
(“ACE2IS binders”). Interestingly, among RBD-binding antibodies, only 12% of clones recognize
the ACE2IS in the RBD, whereas 88% of clones recognize epitopes other than the ACE2IS (Fig.
3A and B). These data are consistent with what we observed in the analysis of antibodies in
convalescent sera (Fig. 2A and B) and suggest that the ACE2IS deflects antibody recognition.
We next performed selection of antibodies binding to the RBD that incorporated a
negative selection step using RBD-T so as to enrich antibodies binding to the ACE2IS. From
this selection, 39% of clones recognized the ACE2IS in the RBD, which is a substantially higher
percentage than those recovered in the unbiased selections (0% for both selections using the
spike protein and the RBD) as well as the RBD-spike selection (11%) (Fig. 3A). These data
indicate that our phage-display library contains antibodies targeting the ACE2IS and such
antibodies can be identified if we intentionally try to enrich such antibodies. Taken together, our
data demonstrate that the RBD is not a dominant immunogenic domain in the spike protein and
the ACE2IS is a minimally immunogenic epitope within the RBD.
Why is the RBD difficult to target when whole spike trimer is used as the antigen? Our
data suggest that the spike protein has highly immunogenic surfaces outside the RBD, which
enrich antibodies that target these epitopes and deplete antibodies to the RBD. The structure
and conformational dynamics of the spike protein offer possible mechanistic basis for the low

immunogenicity of the RBD. The RBD in the up conformation is largely exposed on the spike
surfaces, whereas the RBD in the down conformation is buried in the spike protein (Fig.1A and
4A). Structural studies of the spike protein revealed that zero, one or two RBDs but not all three
RBDs in the spike trimer form the up conformation at a given time [1, 2, 20, 21]. Consequently,
the RBD is largely in the down conformation and most of the RBD is less exposed than the rest
of the spike surfaces (Fig 4A). Furthermore, it has been reported that the RBD in the up
conformation shows higher mobility than that in the down conformation [20]. Thus, both a lack of
the complete exposure of the RBD and conformational mobility of the RBD are probably
contributing to the challenges in recognizing the RBD by antibodies when the spike protein is
used as the antigen.
Our data indicate that the ACE2IS is minimally immunogenic within the RBD, although
the ACE2IS is highly accessible when the RBD is in the up conformation. One possible
explanation for the minimal immunogenicity of the ACE2IS is the conformational flexibility.
Although the ACE2IS is well defined when bound to ACE2 or to an antibody, it is disordered in
the free spike structures (Fig. 4B) [1, 2, 4, 22-25], suggesting that the ACE2IS is inherently
flexible. It is difficult to generate antibodies to a flexible region, due to a large loss of
conformational entropy upon binding that disfavors binding. Taken together, we propose that
limited surface exposure and flexibility of the ACE2IS reduces its immunogenicity in the spike
protein.
Our studies have important implications for vaccine design. Most of vaccine candidates
utilize spike or the RBD as antigens (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-ofcovid-19-candidate-vaccines). In our studies, 89% of antibodies from the unbiased selection for
the spike protein recognize regions outside the RBD, and 83% of antibodies from the unbiased
selection for the RBD recognize the surfaces on the RBD that are inaccessible in the context of
the spike protein. These data imply that potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the ACE2IS
may not be induced efficiently by only immunizing with the spike protein or only with the RBD.
Consistent with this view, it has been reported that the majority of spike-binding antibodies that
were generated in a patient during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were not neutralizing
and bind outside the RBD [26]. Similarly, Juno et al. observed a high frequency of B cells that
target the spike protein outside the RBD in recovered patients with COVID-19 [15]. Our data
demonstrate that the ACE2IS can be readily targeted by antibodies in the biased selection.
Although such control of the human immune responses using designed antigens is impossible
in the course of natural infection, we envision that a two-step vaccination scheme using the

the ACE2IS that confer strong viral neutralization.

Materials and methods
Plasmid construction
The amino acid sequence of the ectodomain of the spike protein (resides 16-1213) was
collected from GenBank entry MN908947.3. A codon-optimized gene encoding the spike protein
with modifications reported by Amanat et al [27], including stabilized mutations (K986P and
V987P), the removal of the furin site (RRAR to A) and the addition of a T4 foldon trimerization
domain, a hexahistidine tag and an Avitag at the C-terminus was synthesized (Integrated DNA
Technologies) and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pBCAG. The codon-optimized
genes encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (residues 328-531;
GenBank entry: MN908947.3) and a triple mutant (N487K/Q493K/N501K) of the RBD of SARSCoV-2 with the hexahistidine tag and the Avitag at the C-terminus were synthesized (Integrated
DNA Technologies) and cloned into the pBCAG vector.
Mammalian cell culture
The A549 cells stably expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the
cell surface were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher)
supplemented with 2 µg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bio)
and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) at 37 oC with 5% CO2. The Expi293F cells (Thermo
Fisher) were maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher) at 37 oC with 8% CO2.
Serum samples
Serum samples were collected from 94 Healthcare workers from NYU Langone Health
who showed PCR-positive for COVID-19, as reported previously [14]. All patients gave written
consent for this study and all samples were de-identified by following IRB #i20-00595.
Expression and purification of antigens
The expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) were transiently transfected with the vectors using
the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 8% CO2 for 7 days. The cell culture
supernatants were collected by centrifuge, and supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) and 1mM PMSF. The recombinant proteins were purified from the filtrated supernatants
using a HisTrap excel column (GE Healthcare). The purified proteins were biotinylated in vitro
using the BirA enzyme in the presence of 0.5 mM Biotin and 10 mM ATP. The biotinylated
proteins were further purified using the HisTrap excel column, and dialyzed into PBS. Purity of

proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The size exclusion chromatography using a
Superdex 200 10/300 (GE Healthcare) for the spike protein and a Superdex 75 10/300 (GE
Healthcare) for the RBD and the RBD triple mutant showed a monodispersed and single peak
with the expected molecular mass (Supplementary Figure 1).
Establishment of ACE2-expressing A549 cells
A549 cells were transfected with pLenti.ACE2 lentiviral vector that encodes ACE2 and
puromycin resistance (Tada et al., Submitted). After two days, the cells were selected in medium
containing 2 µg/ml puromycin and cloned at limiting dilution. Individual cell clones were
screened by flow cytometry for high ACE2 expression and a single cell clone was expanded.
Cell-based binding assay
The ACE2-A549 cells were detached from the flask using the citric saline buffer
containing 15 mM sodium citrate and 135 mM KCl. The cells were washed with PBS twice and
suspended in PBS-BSA (PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA (Gemini Bio)). The cells were aliquoted
into the wells of the 96-well round bottom plate (Greiner). The RBD and the RBD triple mutant
were added to the wells containing the ACE2-A549 cells and incubated for 30min at room
temperature. The cells were washed three times with 200 µL of PBS-BSA, and incubated with
Streptavidin-Dylight650 (Thermo Fisher) for 30min at 4 oC. The cells were further washed three
times with PBS-BSA and analyzed on an iQue screener (Satorius).
Serum characterization
Antibody binding was characterized using a bead-based binding assay, generally
following our previous publications [28, 29]. Biotinylated RBD was conjugated to Dynabeads M280 streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as follows. Ten microliters of the stock bead
suspension were mixed with 90 µl of PBSB (PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA (GeminiBio). The
supernatant was removed using a magnetic stand and the beads were resuspended in 100 µl of
PBSB. The beads were mixed with the equal volume of PBSB containing 15 nM of biotinylated
RBD or biotinylated RBD-T and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Biotin at a final
concentration of 2.5 µM was then added to the solution and incubated for 5 min. The beads
were washed once using a magnetic stand and resuspended at 0.5 mg/ml.
Five microliters of the beads were aliquoted in each well of a 96-well filter plate
(Millipore), the liquid was removed using a vacuum chamber and the wells were washed once
with 150 µl of PBST containing 1% (w/v) skim milk. Serum samples were heat-treated at 56°C

for 1 hr and diluted 158-fold in PBST containing 1% (w/v) skim milk, and 25 µl each was added
to the plate. For competition reactions, biotinylated RBD-T and streptavidin were mixed in such
a way that all the biotin binding sites of streptavidin (tetramer) were occupied with RBD-T, and
the complex was added to the serum solutions at a final concentration of 1 µM (calculated as
monomer). After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature with mixing on a shaker, the
wells were washed twice with 150 µl of PBST-BSA (PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.05%
(v/v) Tween 20). The staining with a secondary antibody (anti-human IgG (FC gamma specific)Alexa488, Jackson Immunoresearch), diluted 1/800 in PBS containing 1 % BSA, was performed
in a total volume of 25 µl for 30 minutes at room temperature with shaking. The wells were
washed again with PBST-BSA and the beads resuspended in 90 µl with PBST-BSA and
analyzed on an iQue screener (Sartorius). Signals reported are the median fluorescence
intensities.
Phage display antibody selection
Sorting of a synthetic antibody library was performed as described previously [18].
Briefly, a synthetic human antibody library was sorted against the antigens listed in the Fig.3A.
at the concentrations of 100 nM (1st round), 100 nM (2nd round), 50 nM (3rd round) and 20 nM
(4th round). In the biased selection using RBD-T as the antigen for negative selection,
biotinylated RBD-T was immobilized on the Streptavidin MagneSphere particles (Promega) and
added to the solution containing phage. Phage bound to the RBD-T-beads were removed prior
to the selection against the antigens.
Phage ELISA
Phage ELISA was performed as described previously except that the 384-well plate was
used instead of the 96-well plate [18]. Briefly, the wells of the 384-well ELISA plate (Nunc) were
coated with neutravidin (Thermo Fisher) for 1 hr at room temperature. The wells were washed
with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked with PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA
(Gemini Bio) for 1hr. After removing the blocking buffer, biotinylated antigens were added to
each well and washed three times with PBS-T. The 5-fold dilution of the cell culture
supernatants containing phage were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min. After washing
the wells with PBS-T three times, anti-M13HRP (Sino Biological) was added to the wells.
SIGMAFASTTM OPD (Sigma) was used as a substrate and 2 M HCl was used as a quenching
solution. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a BioTek Epoch 2 plate reader
(BioTek).

Figure 1. Design of an RBD triple mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS. (A) The structure of the
spike trimer (PDB 6VSB). The RBD in the up and down conformations are shown in blue and
light blue, respectively. (B) The RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB 6M0J). The RBD core is
shown in blue and ACE2 is shown in green. The receptor binding motif in the RBD is shown in
yellow, and the residues contacting ACE2 are shown in red. The dotted circles indicate contact
regions (CR1, CR2 and CR3). The amino acid residues (N487, Q493 and N501) in the RBD are
shown as stick model and labeled in red, and their contacting residues in ACE2 are labeled in
black. (C) Binding titration of the RBD and RBD-T to ACE2 expressing A549 cells. Data shown
here are from triplicate measurements. The KD values are from curve fitting of a 1:1 binding
model, and the errors shown are the s.d. from curve fitting. Error bars are within the size of the
symbols.
Figure 2. Majority of convalescent serum samples do not target the ACE2IS (A) Binding
analysis of IgGs in convalescent serum samples. In the top panel, the binding of the antibodies
to the RBD in the absence (blue bars) and presence of soluble RBD-T as a competitor (red
bars) are shown. The bottom panel shows a control experiment to confirm that competition with
RBD-T was completely achieved in this assay. (B) The fraction of the antibodies targeting the
ACE2IS among the RBD-binding antibodies in each serum sample is calculated as a
competition ratio (signal in the presence of the RBD-T competitor over signal in its absence) and
shown. Samples are sorted from low to high competition ratio. The red line indicates a
competition ratio of 40%, i.e., 60% of binding signal is lost in the presence of the RBD-T
competitor.
Figure 3. Antibody selections against the RBD and the spike protein revealed
immunogenic properties of epitopes within the spike protein (A) Summary of antibody
selections in the biased and unbased manners. (B) Binding analysis of phage-displayed
antibodies by ELISA. Data for representative clones for each specificity type are shown. See
also Supplementary Figure 2 for the complete dataset.
Figure 4. Possible mechanistic basis of low immunogenicity of the RBD and the ACE2IS
(A) The RBD in the up and the down conformations in the spike structure (PDB 6VSB). The
RBD core and the receptor binding motif (RBM) are shown in blue and yellow. The residues
within 6 Å of other regions in the spike protein are shown in orange. The other RBDs in the

spike trimer are shown in white. The RBD in the up conformation is exposed whereas the RBDs
in the down conformation are buried in the spike protein. (B) Comparison of the RBD structures.
The RBD core and the RBM are shown in blue and yellow. The disordered regions in these
structures are shown as the dotted lines, and the numbers of missing residues are indicated.
The RBD structures indicated in a parenthesis have nearly identical structures, and the
representative structures are shown and whose PDB codes are indicated in blue.
