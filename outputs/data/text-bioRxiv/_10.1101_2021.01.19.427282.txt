COVID-19 viral RNA in circulation cells
1

Summary

2

In late 2019 a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged, and has since caused a global

3

pandemic. Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease is necessary to inform

4

development of therapeutics, and management of infected patients. Using scRNAseq of blood

5

drawn from SARS-CoV-2 patients, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 may exploit immune cells

6

as a ‘Trojan Horse’ to disseminate and access multiple organ systems. Our data suggests that

7

circulating cells are not actively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and do not appear to be a source of

8

viral dissemination.

Introduction

12

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

13

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in late 2019, but by December 9, 2020 has

14

spread to 220 countries, with over 67 million confirmed cases and over 1.5 million confirmed

15

deaths 1. Patients with COVID-19 present with a diverse range of symptoms from asymptomatic,

16

mild (cough, fatigue), moderate (non-mild pneumonia), severe (dyspnea, low oxygen saturation)

17

to critical (respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) 2,3. In

18

addition to this range of respiratory symptoms, there are emerging reports of thromboembolism 4,

19

neural defects (both central and peripheral, ie. anosmia and ageusia 5,6), and Kawasaki-like

20

symptoms in children 7. Currently, the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and more specifically

21

how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 contributes to clinical disease progression, remains

22

poorly understood.

COVID-19 viral RNA in circulation cells
24

Coronaviruses are enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA viruses that can infect both

25

humans and many other mammals 3. Of those that infect humans, some cause only mild

26

symptoms, such as hCoV-OC43 8. This ‘common cold’ coronavirus shares only 56% genomic

27

sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2 (using BLAST search:

28

https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). However, other coronaviruses cause severe respiratory

29

diseases; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was discovered in 2003

30

and causes SARS, while Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was

31

discovered in 2012 and causes MERS. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have 10% and

32

37% mortality rates respectively 9,10 and share 79% and 50% genomic sequence homology to

33

SARS-CoV-2, respectively 11.

34
35

SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the blood of infected patients 12, as have SARS-CoV 13,14 and

36

MERS-CoV 15,16. Conflicting reports exist regarding viremia (infectious virus in the circulation)

37

in COVID-19, 17,18 versus the presence of viral RNA in blood samples 3 and the clinical

38

significance of this nuance. Indeed, previous reports of viremia in COVID-19 patients include

39

those using bulk RNAseq 19,20, which fail to convincingly show that individual cells of the

40

circulation contain SARS-CoV-2 genetic material.

41
42

A recent pre-print reported SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in CD68+/CD169+ macrophages in the

43

lungs of severe COVID-19 patients 21, supporting a previous report of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

44

containing macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 22. Furthermore, multiple

45

organ systems beyond the lung are also affected in severe COVID-19 disease 23, and multiorgan

46

tropism has been reported 24, which raises the possibility that visceral organ infection may be

47

contributing to disease severity, though a causal link has not yet been demonstrated. In light of

48

this, a review by Abassi and colleagues recently questioned whether SARS-CoV-2 dissemination

49

to distal organs is facilitated by infected macrophages re-entering the circulation 25. Here, our

50

objective was to understand the potential for circulating immune cell infection as a mode of viral

51

dissemination to distal organs.

Results

54

Viral Protein Circulates in Severe COVID-19 Patients

55

Five patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and PCR confirmed

56

SARS-CoV-2 infection (severe COVID-19 disease) were enrolled and had blood drawn within

57

72 h of admission to the ICU (Supplementary Table 1). We detected one or more viral proteins in

58

the plasma of each of the five patients (Table 1). NSP3 (encoded by the ORF1ab gene) was

59

detected in all samples, while NSP3, the spike protein S1 and RNA-directed RNA polymerase

60

were found in three of the plasma samples. One sample, from patient UC_5, contained 5 SARS-

61

CoV-2 specific proteins.

62
63

SARS-CoV-2 Does Not Infect Circulating Immune Cells

64

From whole blood, we isolated leukocytes and enriched for the lymphocyte population to ensure

65

that enough lymphocytes would be collected/assessed due to reported lymphocytopenia 26. The

66

leukocytes and lymphocytes were mixed in equal ratios prior to conducting scRNAseq using the

67

10X Genomics Single Cell 3’ NextGEM (v3.1) technology. The resulting sequences were

68

aligned with the human genome (GRCh38) appended with the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two

69

versions of the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome were used to account for potential shifting in the

sequence over time and possibility of the predominant variant differing based on geographical

71

locations. MT412228 was isolated in Seattle, USA and MN908947.3 was isolated in Shenzhen,

72

China. Because our study was conducted in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, MT412228 is reported

73

here unless specified, as at the time of publication this reference genome was the closest

74

available geographically to Calgary. This method of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the

75

peripheral blood cell samples was confirmed by aligning a control group of publicly available

76

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (denoted by BALF_) sample sequences to the same custom

77

reference genome. These BALF samples were isolated from three healthy control patients, three

78

mild COVID-19 patients, and six patients with severe COVID-19 from Shenzhen, China 27.

79
80

All UC_ and BALF_ samples were aggregated together using CellRanger, and processed using

81

the Seurat workflow 28. Supplementary Table 2 outlines the number of cells aggregated from

82

each sample after quality control. The peripheral immune cells clustered together, but did not

83

overlap with the BALF samples, as expected. Distinct cell types were annotated based on

84

established cell type markers, with UC_ denoting cell types found only within the peripheral

85

immune cell samples (Figure 1).

86
87

We found that none of the five mixed leukocyte/lymphocyte samples (denoted by UC_)

88

contained any SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 3). However, as discussed by

89

Bost et al, the BALF samples contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which was located primarily in

90

macrophages and epithelial cells 22. Using our custom genome as a reference, six of the nine

91

COVID-19 BALF samples (two mild and four severe) contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 1,

92

Supplementary Table 3), again in concordance with the Bost et al study. The same samples were

93

positive when aligned to the control reference genome containing MN908947.3 (Figure 2). This

94

suggests that aligning to our custom SARS-CoV-2 reference genome is a robust method of

95

detecting SARS-CoV-2, and taken together supports that peripheral immune cells do not contain

96

SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of note, we examined one additional SARS-CoV-2 positive patient who

97

presented with a thrombotic stroke, but no respiratory symptoms or ARDS (and subsequently

98

was not included in the aggregated data presented here), who also lacked any detectable SARS-

99

CoV-2 RNA in the isolated circulating immune cells. While anecdotal, given we studied only

100

one patient exhibiting clotting symptoms, it does suggest that this divergent clinical presentation

101

is also not due to direct infection of circulating platelets or other immune cells.

102
103

Immune Cells in the Lung Contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA

104

SARS-CoV-2 was detected in cell types harboring surface receptors that facilitate SARS-CoV-2

105

entry into human cells. Epithelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils were the three most

106

common cell types in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 4).

107

Unsurprisingly, the spike protein cell surface processing protease transmembrane protease serine

108

2 (TMPRSS2) and surface receptor (for host cell entry) angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2

109

) 29 were highly expressed in epithelial cells (Figure 1). Macrophages expressed neuropilin-1

110

(NRP1), which has also been reported as a means of host cell entry (Figure 1)30,31. Neutrophils do

111

not express ACE2, TMPRSS2 or NRP1, suggesting that they phagocytosed viral particles or

112

their products without being actively infected, and raises the possibility that macrophages may

113

do the same.

115

It is also important to note that the BALF samples were isolated using 10X Genomics 5’

116

technology, whereas the peripheral immune cells presented here, were isolated using 10X

117

Genomics 3’ technology. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should theoretically be captured

118

using either technology. However, to ensure that coronavirus RNA could be detected in the

119

peripheral cells, we also prepared a control sample of hCoV-OC43 (a ‘common cold’

120

coronavirus)-infected primary Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs, Lonza) as a

121

control for 3’ capture of viral RNA. OC43-infected HUVECs were processed identically to the

122

peripheral cells. We aligned the resulting sequences with a custom reference genome, again

123

based on GRCh38, with the hCoV-OC43 genome (NC_006213.1) appended, and were able to

124

reliably detect hCoV-OC43 RNA using our analysis pipeline (Figure 2), suggesting that the

125

inability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the circulating immune cells was not due to the 3’ sequencing

126

approach.

127
128

Discussion

129

We identified viral protein in the plasma of all five of the patients in this study, which raises the

130

question of whether the viral load is correlated with the patient’s clinical outcome. As

131

mentioned, we detected five viral proteins in the plasma from patient UC_5, more than in the

132

other four patients. Patient UC_5 was the only participant enrolled in our study that died while in

133

the ICU. This recapitulates a recently published association between viral RNA load and

134

COVID-19 severity and mortality, in which approximately a third of plasma samples contained

135

detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA32. While our sample size is limited, the fact that we identified

136

viral proteins in the plasma from all five participants suggests that either, our participants had

137

more severe disease and/or the LC-MS/MS method used here may be a more sensitive detection

138

method for SARS-CoV-2 in plasma. In either case, this warrants further investigation.

139
140

Our study was not designed to determine if there is a causal link between viral tropism and

141

disease severity or symptoms in distal organs, and there is still no direct evidence of such in

142

literature. Causality of a direct viral effect in distal organs is difficult to parse out, partly due to

143

the systemic effects of the immune response to severe lung infection. However, this remains an

144

important concern that could directly affect treatment options for patients with severe COVID-

145

19.

146
147

While immune cells in the lung are likely infected based on previous reports, our data suggests

148

that the circulation of free virus, but not SARS-CoV-2 infected circulating immune cells, is the

149

primary route of viral dissemination to visceral organs.

Methods

151
152

Enrolment and consent/REB approval

153

Peripheral blood samples were obtained from consenting ICU patients, recovered COVID-19,

154

and healthy donors in Calgary, Canada. All experiments involving or human samples received

155

approval from the Conjoint Health Ethics Review Board at the University of Calgary.

156
157

Lymphocyte preparation

158

Whole blood (2mL) was collected into 5mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes. Tubes were spun

159

(15min, 3000rpm, Room Temperature [RT]), plasma removed, and stored at -80oC for plasma

160

proteomic analysis. 100µL of Isolation Cocktail and 100µL of Rapid Spheres (Easy SepTM Direct

161

Human Total Lymphocytes Isolation Kit: 19655, StemCell Technologies) were added to the

162

remaining whole blood. After mixing and 5min incubation at RT, the sample volumes of ≤

163

2.5mL blood were topped up to 5mL with D-PBS+2%FBS + 1mM EDTA. The diluted sample

164

was incubated in the magnet without lid for 5min, at RT. This last step was repeated twice before

165

cell resuspension in 5mL of PBS+0.04% BSA. After 2 washes in PBS+0.04% BSA, and

166

centrifugation for 5 min at 2000rpm, 7500 lymphocytes were resuspended in 25µL of

167

PBS+0.04% BSA.

Leukocyte preparation

170

Whole blood was collected in heparin containing vacuutubes and 12µL of 0.5M EDTA with

171

1mL of PBS+2% FBS and 50µL of RBC of EasySep RBC Depletion spheres (EasySep TM RBC

incubation, at RT, tubes were inverted and poured into a new tube. 50µL of RBC depletion

174

spheres were added. 5 min after incubation on the magnet, the tube was inverted and cell

175

suspension was poured into a new 15mL tube. After 2 washes in 5mL of PBS+0.04% BSA and

176

centrifugation at 2000rpm for 5 min at 20oC, cells were resuspended in 25µL of PBS+0.04%

hCoV-OC43 preparation and HUVEC transduction

184

Stocks of hCoV-OC43 (ATCC) were propagated in Vero E6 cells (ATCC). To produce viral

185

stocks, Vero E6 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 for 1h in serum-free DMEM (Thermo

186

Fisher) at 33˚C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Following infection, the viral inoculum

187

was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo

188

Fisher) and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Thermo Fisher). After 6 days, the

189

supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 2000 RPM for 5 mins to isolate cell-free virus.

190

Virus stocks were stored at -80˚C. Viral titres were enumerated using Reed and Muench tissue-

191

culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) in Vero E6 cells 33.

192
193

Pooled human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Lonza, Basal, Switzerland) were

194

cultured using endothelial growth media (EGM-2; Lonza). To passage cells, cell culture plates

195

were pre-coated with 0.1% (w/v) porcine gelatine (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, US) in 1X PBS

for 30 min at 37˚C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For infection, HUVECs were seeded

197

into a pre-coated plate to achieve ~80% confluency after 24 hours. The following day, the

198

growth media was removed and replaced with 100mL of hCoV-OC43 inoculum and incubated at

199

37˚C for one hour, shaking the plate every 10 minutes to distribute viral inoculum. Following

200

incubation, the virus inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh EGM-2 for 12 or 24 hours

201

before cells were prepared for scRNAseq.

202
203

Reference genome construction, alignment and aggregation

204

Raw sequencing reads (BCL files) were converted to FASTQs using the CellRanger mkfastq

205

pipeline (version 3.0.1). Transcript alignment was performed against a modified human reference

206

transcriptome generated using CellRanger’s mkref pipeline by appending either MT412228

207

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT412228) or MN908947.3

208

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) sequence to a pre-built GRCh38-3.0.0

209

reference. SARS-CoV-2 GTF files were generated with the feature type marked as "exon" which

210

were concatenated with GRCh38-3.0.0 GTF annotation files. Likewise, the SARS-CoV-2

211

FASTAs containing raw sequences were concatenated with the genome.fa file in GRCh38-3.0.0

212

reference. FASTA and GTF outputs following concatenation were provided as inputs to “fasta”

213

and “genes” arguments for cellranger mkref. Note that this approach did not generate a conjoined

214

genome containing both human and SARS-CoV-2 sequences as separate genomes. Instead this

215

approach added a new pseudogene called “SARS-CoV-2” to the human genome, as SARS-CoV-

216

2 is expected to generate transcripts in infected human cells. Reads from individual libraries

217

were processed using Cellranger count and were then concatenated into a single feature-barcode

218

matrix using Cellranger aggr, with “mapped” normalization mode to subsample reads from

Publicly available control samples and re-alignment

223

Raw single-cell BALF samples isolated in Shenzhen, China, as described in Liao, Liu, Yuan, et

224

al. and accessioned under SRP250732 were downloaded using the SRA-Toolkit’s prefetch

225

function 27. The following samples were downloaded: SRR11181959 (severe COVID),

226

SRR11181956 (severe COVID), SRR11181958 (severe COVID), SRR11537947 (healthy

227

control), SRR11181954 (mild COVID), SRR11181955 (mild COVID), SRR11537946 (healthy

228

control), SRR11181957 (mild COVID), SRR11537948 (healthy control), SRR11537949 (severe

229

COVID), SRR11537951 (severe COVID), and SRR11537950 (severe COVID). SRA files were

230

converted to FASTQs using the fastq-dump --split-files function in SRA Toolkit 2.10.5. FASTQs

231

were aligned and aggregated with peripheral blood scRNA-Seq samples by mapping to our

232

custom (SARS-CoV-2-appended to GRCh38-3.0.0) assembly, as described above.

Dimensionality reduction, clustering and gene expression

235

Output aggregated, filtered feature matrix files were imported into a SeuratObject using Seurat

236

V3.1.5 and R Version 3.6.1, using default parameters 28,34. Data was subsetted on

237

‘nCount_RNA’, ‘nFeature_RNA’, and ‘percent.mt’ values of 30,000, 5,000 and 10%

238

respectively. Normalization and scaling were done using default parameters followed by

239

principle component analysis (PCA). The first 20 PCA were used for UMAP multi-dimensional

240

reduction, based on the limited standard deviation in any further PCA. Graph based clustering

241

with resolution of 1.0 was first used to identify clusters that also differentiated amongst sample

TMPRSS2, NRP1, and SARS-CoV-2 were assessed across samples as called by the Seurat

247

Shotgun proteomics of COVID-19 patient samples

248

The plasma of severe COVID-19 patients (N = 5) shown in Table 1 were collected and subjected

249

to quantitative proteomics. Samples were lysed in 1% SDS, 100mM ammonium bicarbonate,

250

1mM EDTA, and 1X protease inhibitors. Samples were sonicated on ice, centrifuged at 10,000𝑔

251

and stored at -80°C until TMT-6plex™ Isobaric Labeling. Protein concentrations were

252

determined by a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer at 280nm. 200µg of protein was mixed with

253

lysis buffer (1% SDS, 100mM ammonium bicarbonate, 1mM EDTA, and 1X protease inhibitors)

254

to a final volume of 100µL. Samples were subjected to a quantitative proteomics workflow as

255

272

Tryptic peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer

273

(Thermo Scientific) operated with Xcalibur (version 4.0.21.10) and coupled to a Thermo

274

Scientific Easy-nLC (nanoflow liquid chromatography) 1200 System. Tryptic peptides (2µg)

275

were loaded onto a C18 trap (75µm x 2cm; Acclaim PepMap 100, P/N 164946; ThermoFisher)

276

at a flow rate of 2µL/min of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade H2O). Peptides were

277

eluted using a 120min gradient from 5 to 40% (5% to 28% in 105min followed by an increase to

278

40% B in 15min) of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80% LC-MS grade acetonitrile) at a flow

279

rate of 0.3µL/min and separated on a C18 analytical column (75µm x 50cm; PepMap RSLC

280

C18; P/N ES803A; ThermoScientific). Peptides were then electrosprayed using 2.1kV voltage

281

into the ion transfer tube (300°C) of the Orbitrap Lumos operating in positive mode. The

282

Orbitrap first performed a full MS scan at a resolution of 120,000 FWHM to detect the precursor

283

ion having a m/z between 375 and 1,575 and a +2 to +4 charge. The Orbitrap AGC (Auto Gain

284

Control) and the maximum injection time were set at 4 x 105 and 50ms, respectively. The

285

Orbitrap was operated using the top speed mode with a 3 second cycle time for precursor

286

selection. The most intense precursor ions presenting a peptidic isotopic profile and having an

287

intensity threshold of at least 2 x 104 were isolated using the quadrupole (Isolation window (m/z)

289

fragment ions (MS2) were analyzed in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15,000. The AGC and the

290

maximum injection time were set at 1 x 105 and 105ms, respectively. The first mass for the MS2

291

was set at 100 to acquire the TMT reporter ions. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 45 seconds
