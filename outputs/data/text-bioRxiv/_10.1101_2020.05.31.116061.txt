Abstract

19

Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute

20

Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the

21

evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian

22

statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences)

to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-

24

switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha- than beta-CoVs, and

25

more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus

26

switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host

27

taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help

28

target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic

29

analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.

Introduction

32

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses causing respiratory and enteric diseases with varying

33

pathogenicity in humans and animals. All CoVs known to infect humans are zoonotic, or of animal origin,

34

with many thought to originate in bat hosts1,2. Due to their large genome size (the largest non-

35

segmented RNA viral genome), frequent recombination and high genomic plasticity, CoVs are prone to

36

cross-species transmission and are able to rapidly adapt to new hosts1,3. This phenomenon is thought to

37

have led to the emergence of a number of CoVs affecting livestock and human health4-9. Three of these

38

causing significant outbreaks originated in China during the last two decades. Severe Acute Respiratory

39

Syndrome (SARS)-CoV emerged first in humans in Guangdong province, southern China, in 2002 and

40

spread globally, causing fatal respiratory infections in close to 800 people10-12. Subsequent investigations

41

identified horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) as the natural reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs and the

42

likely origin of SARS-CoV13-16. In 2016, Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS)-CoV caused the death of

43

over 25,000 pigs in farms within Guangdong province17. This virus appears to have originated within

44

Rhinolophus spp. bats, and belongs to the HKU2-CoV clade previously detected in bats in the region17-19.

45

In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of respiratory illness (COVID-19) first

46

detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which has since become a pandemic. This emerging human

47

virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, and also appears to have originated in horseshoe bats20,21 - with its

48

full genome 96% similar to a viral sequence reported from Rhinolophus affinis20. Closely related

49

sequences were also identified in Malayan pangolins22,23.

50

A growing body of research has identified bats as the evolutionary sources of SARS- and Middle East

51

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoVs 13,14,24-26, and as the source of progenitors for the human CoVs, NL63

52

and 229E27,28. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 further underscores the importance of bat-origin CoVs to

53

global health, and understanding their origin and cross-species transmission is a high priority for

54

pandemic preparedness20,29. Bats harbor the largest diversity of CoVs among mammals and two CoV

55

genera, alpha- and beta-CoVs (α- and β-CoVs), have been widely detected in bats from most regions of

56

the world30,31. Bat-CoV diversity seems to be correlated with host taxonomic diversity globally, the

57

highest CoV diversity being found in areas with the highest bat species richness32. Host switching of

58

viruses over evolutionary time is an important mechanism driving the evolution of bat coronaviruses in

59

nature and appears to vary geographically32,33. However, detailed analyses of host-switching have been

60

hampered by incomplete or opportunistic sampling, typically with relatively low numbers of viral

61

sequences from any given region34.

62

China has a rich bat fauna, with more than 100 described bat species and several endemic species

63

representing both the Palearctic and Indo-Malay regions35. Its situation at the crossroads of two

64

zoogeographic regions heightens China’s potential to harbor a unique and distinctive CoV diversity.

65

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, China has been the focus of an intense viral surveillance and

66

a large number of diverse bat-CoVs has been discovered in the region36-44. However, the macroevolution

67

of CoVs in their bat hosts in China and their cross-species transmission dynamics remain poorly

68

understood.

69

In this study, we analyze an extensive field-collected dataset of bat-CoV sequences from across China.

70

We use a phylogeographic Bayesian statistical framework to reconstruct virus transmission history

71

between different bat host species and virus spatial spread over evolutionary time. Our objectives were

72

to compare the macroevolutionary patterns of α- and β-CoVs and identify the hosts and geographical

73

regions that act as centers of evolutionary diversification for bat-CoVs in China. These analyses aim to

74

improve our understanding of how CoVs evolve, diversify, circulate among, and transmit between bat

75

families and genera to help identify bat hosts and regions where the risk of CoV spillover is the highest.

Taxonomic and geographic sampling

78

We generated 630 partial sequences (440 nt) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from

79

bat rectal swabs collected in China and added 608 bat-CoV and eight pangolin CoV sequences from

80

China available in GenBank or GISAID to our datasets (list of GenBank and GISAID accession numbers

81

available in Supplementary Note 1). For each CoV genus, two datasets were created: one including all

82

bat-CoV sequences with known host (host dataset) and one including all bat-CoV sequences with known

83

sampling location at the province level (geographic dataset). To create a geographically discrete

84

partitioning scheme that was more ecologically relevant than administrative borders for our

85

phylogeographic reconstructions, we defined six zoogeographic regions within China by clustering

86

provinces with similar mammalian diversity using hierarchical clustering45 (see Methods): South western

87

region (SW), Northern region (NO), Central northern region (CN), Central region (CE), Southern region

88

(SO) and Hainan island (HI) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

89

Our host datasets included 701 α-CoV sequences (353 new sequences, including 102 new SADSr-CoV

90

sequences (Rhinacovirus) from 41 bat species (14 genera, five families) and 528 β-CoV sequences (273

91

new sequences, including 97 new SARSr-CoV sequences (Sarbecovirus) from 31 bat species (15 genera,

92

four families) (Supplementary Table 1). Our geographic datasets included 677 α-CoV sequences from six

93

zoogeographic regions (22 provinces) and 503 β-CoV sequences from five zoogeographic regions (21

94

provinces) (Fig. 1). As some regions or hosts were overrepresented in our datasets, we also created and

95

ran our analyses using a more uniform subset of our sequence data that included ~30 randomly-selected

96

sequences per host family or region to mitigate sampling and surveillance intensity bias.

97

Ancestral hosts and cross-species transmission

98

We used a Bayesian discrete phylogeographic approach implemented in BEAST46 to reconstruct the

99

ancestral host of each node in the phylogenetic tree using bat host family as a discrete character state.

100

The phylogenetic reconstructions for α-CoVs in China suggest an evolutionary origin within rhinolophid

101

and vespertilionid bats (Fig. 2A). The first α-CoV lineage to diverge historically corresponds to the

102

subgenus Rhinacovirus (L1), originating within rhinolophid bats, and includes sequences related to

103

HKU2-CoV and SADS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 2). Then several lineages, labelled L2 to L7, emerged from

104

vespertilionid bats (Fig. 2A). The subgenus Decacovirus (L2) includes sequences mostly associated with

105

the Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae and related to HKU10-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 3), while the

106

subgenera Myotacovirus (L3) and Pedacovirus (L5) as well as an unidentified lineage (L4) include CoVs

107

mainly from vespertilionid bats and related to HKU6-, HKU10-, and 512-CoVs (Supplementary Fig. 4-5).

108

Finally, a well-supported node comprises the subgenera Nyctacovirus (L6) from vespertilionid bats and

109

Minunacovirus (L7) from miniopterid bats, and includes HKU7-, HKU8-, 1A-, and 1B-CoVs

110

(Supplementary Fig. 6). These seven α-CoV lineages are mostly associated with a single host family but

111

each also included several sequences identified from other bat families (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 2-6

112

and Supplementary Table 1), suggesting frequent cross-species transmission events have occurred

113

among bats. Ancestral host reconstructions based on the random data subset, to normalize sampling

114

effort, gave very similar results with rhinolophids and vespertilionids being the most likely ancestral

115

hosts of most α-CoV lineages too (Supplementary Fig. 7A). However, the topology of the tree based on

116

the random subset was slightly different as the lineage L5 was paraphyletic.

117

Chinese β-CoVs likely originated from vespertilionid and rhinolophid bats (Fig. 2B). The MCC tree was

118

clearly structured into four main lineages: Merbecovirus (Lineage C), including MERS-related (MERSr-)

119

CoVs, HKU4- and HKU5-CoVs and strictly restricted to vespertilionid bats (Supplementary Fig. 8);

120

Nobecovirus (lineage D), originating from pteropodid bats and corresponding to HKU9-CoV

121

(Supplementary Fig. 9); Hibecovirus (lineage E) comprising sequences isolated in hipposiderid bats

122

(Supplementary Fig. 10) and Sarbecovirus (Lineage B) including sequences related to HKU3- and SARS-

123

related (SARSr-) CoVs originating in rhinolophid bats (Supplementary Fig. 11). We show that SARS-CoV-2

124

forms a divergent clade within Sarbecovirus and is most closely related to viruses sampled from

125

Rhinolophus malayanus and R. affinis and from Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (Fig. 3). Similar tree

126

topology and ancestral host inference were obtained with the random subset (Supplementary Fig. 7B).

127

We used a Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) procedure47 to identify viral host

128

switches (transmission over evolutionary time) between bat families and genera that occurred along the

129

branches of the MCC annotated tree and calculated Bayesian Factor (BF) to estimate the significance of

130

these switches (Fig. 4). We identified nine highly supported (BF > 10) inter-family host switches for α-

131

CoVs and three for β-CoVs (Fig. 4A and 4B). These results are robust over a range of sample sizes, with

132

seven of these nine switches for α-CoVs and the exact same three host switches for β-CoVs having

133

strong BF support (BF > 10) when analyzing our random subset (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). To

134

quantify the magnitude of these host switches, we estimated the number of host switching events

135

(Markov jumps)48,49 along the significant inter-family switches (Fig. 4C and 4D) and estimated the rate of

136

inter-family host switching events per unit of time for each CoV genus. The rate of inter-family host

137

switching events was five times higher in the evolutionary history of α- (0.010 host switches/unit time)

138

than β-CoVs (0.002 host switches/unit time) in China. For α-CoVs, host switching events from the

139

Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae were greater than from other bat families while rhinolophids were

140

the highest donor family for β-CoVs. The Rhinolophidae and the Vespertilionidae for α-CoVs and the

141

Hipposideridae for β-CoVs received the highest numbers of switching events (Fig. 4C and 4D). When

142

using the random dataset, similar results were obtained for β-CoVs while rhinolophids were the highest

143

donor family for α-CoVs (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

144

At the genus level, we identified 20 highly supported inter-genus host switches for α-CoVs, 17 of them

145

were also highly significant using the random subset (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 6). Sixteen highly

146

supported inter-genus switches were identified for β-CoVs (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained for

147

the random β-CoV subset (Supplementary Table 7). Most of the significant cross-genus CoV switches for

148

α-CoVs, 15 of 20 (75%), were between genera in different bat families, while this proportion was only 6

149

of 16 (37.5%) for β-CoVs. The estimated rate of inter-genus host switching events (Markov jumps) was

150

similar for α- (0.014 host switches/unit time) and β-CoVs (0.014 host switches/unit time). For α-CoVs,

151

Rhinolophus and Miniopterus were the greatest donor genera and Rhinolophus was the greatest receiver

152

(Supplementary Table 8). For β-CoVs, Rousettus was the greatest donor and Eonycteris the greatest

153

receiver genus (Supplementary Table 9).

154

CoV spatiotemporal dispersal in China

155

We used our Bayesian discrete phylogeographic model with zoogeographic regions as character states

156

to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of CoV dispersal in China. Eleven and seven highly

157

significant (BF > 10) dispersal routes within China were identified for α- and β-CoVs, respectively (Fig. 6).

158

Seven and five of these dispersal routes, respectively, remained significant when using our random

159

subsets (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). The Rhinacovirus lineage (L1) that includes HKU2- and SADS-

160

CoV likely originated in the SO region while all other α-CoV lineages historically arose in SW China and

161

spread to other regions before several dispersal events from SO and NO in all directions (Fig. 6A and

162

Supplementary Fig. 12). A roughly similar pattern of α-CoV dispersal was obtained using the random

163

subset (Supplementary Tables 10 and 12).

164

The oldest inferred dispersal movements for β-CoVs occurred among the SO and SW regions (Fig. 6B).

165

The SO region was the likely origin of Merbecovirus (Lineage C, including HKU4- and HKU5-CoV) and

166

Sarbecovirus subgenera (Lineage B, including HKU3- and SARSr-CoVs) while the Nobecovirus (lineage D,

167

including HKU9-CoV) and Hibecovirus (lineage E) subgenera originated in SW China (Supplementary Fig.

168

12). Then several dispersal movements likely originated from SO and CE (Fig. 6B). More recent

169

southward dispersal from NO was observed. Similar spatiotemporal dispersal patterns were observed

170

using the random subset of β-CoVs (Supplementary Tables 11 and 13).

171

The estimated rate of migration events per unit of time along these significant dispersal routes was

172

more than two times higher for α- (0.026 host switches/unit time) than β-CoVs (0.011 host switches/unit

173

time) and SO was the region involved in the greatest total number of migration events for both α- and β-

174

CoVs. SO had the highest number of outbound and inbound migration events for α-CoVs (Fig. 6C and

175

Supplementary Table 12). For β-CoVs, the highest number of outbound migration events was estimated

176

to be from NO and SO while SO and SW had the highest numbers of inbound migration events (Fig. 6D

177

and Supplementary Table 13).

178

Phylogenetic diversity

179

In order to identify the hotspots of CoV phylogenetic diversity in China and evaluate phylogenetic

180

clustering of CoVs, we calculated the Mean Phylogenetic Distance (MPD) and the Mean Nearest Taxon

181

Distance (MNTD) statistics50 and their standardized effect size (SES).

182

We found significant and negative SES MPD values, indicating significant phylogenetic clustering, within

183

all bat families and genera for both α- and β-CoVs, except within the Aselliscus and Tylonycteris for α-

184

CoVs (Fig. 7A and 7B). Negative and mostly significant SES MNTD values, reflecting phylogenetic

185

structure closer to the tips, were also observed within most bat families and genera for α- and β-CoVs

186

but we found non-significant positive SES MNTD value for vespertilionid bats, and particularly for those

187

in the Pipistrellus genus, for β-CoVs (Fig. 7A and 7B). In general, we observed lower phylogenetic

188

diversity for β- than α-CoVs within all bat families and most genera when looking at SES MPD, but the

189

difference in the level of diversity between α- and β-CoVs is less important when looking at SES MNTD

190

(Fig. 7). These results suggest stronger basal clustering (reflected by larger SES MPD values) for β-CoVs

191

than α-CoVs, indicating stronger host structuring effect and phylogenetic conservatism for β-CoVs. Very

192

similar results were obtained with the random subsets for both α- and β-CoVs (Supplementary Tables

193

14-21).

194

We found negative and mostly significant values of MPD and MNTD (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Tables

195

22-25) indicating significant phylogenetic clustering of CoV lineages in bat communities within the same

196

zoogeographic region. However, SES MPD values for α-CoVs in SW were positive (significant for the

197

random subset) indicating a greater evolutionary diversity of CoVs in that region than others (Fig. 7 and

198

Supplementary Tables 22-25). We used a linear regression analysis to assess the relationship between

199

CoV phylogenetic diversity and bat species richness in China and determine if bat richness is a significant

200

predictor of bat-CoV diversity and evolution. α-CoV phylogenetic diversity (MPD) was not significantly

201

correlated to total bat species richness or sampled bat species richness in zoogeographic regions or

202

provinces (Supplementary Table 26). Non-significant correlations between bat species richness and β-

203

CoV phylogenetic diversity were also observed at the zoogeographic region level (Supplementary Table

204

27). However, a significant correlation was observed between sampled bat species richness and β-CoV

205

phylogenetic diversity at the province level (Supplementary Table 27). Similar results were obtained

206

when using the random subsets (Supplementary Tables 26 and 27). These findings suggest that bat host

207

diversity is not the main driver of CoV diversity in China and that other ecological or biogeographic

208

factors may influence this diversity. We observed higher CoV diversity than expected in several southern

209

or central provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Hunan) given their underlying total or sampled bat diversity

210

(Supplementary Fig. 13 and 14).

211

We also assessed patterns of CoV phylogenetic turnover/differentiation among Chinese zoogeographic

212

regions and bat host families by measuring the inter-region and inter-host values of MPD (equivalent to

213

a measure of phylogenetic β-diversity) and their SES. We found positive inter-family SES MPD values,

214

except between Pteropodidae and Hipposideridae for α-CoVs and between Rhinolophidae and

215

Hipposideridae for β-CoVs (Fig. 8A and 8B and Supplementary Tables 28 and 29), suggesting higher

216

phylogenetic differentiation of CoVs among most bat families than among random communities. Our

217

phylo-ordination based on inter-family MPD values indicated that α-CoVs from vespertilionids and

218

miniopterids, and from hipposiderids and pteropodids; as well as β-CoVs from rhinolophids and

219

hipposiderids are phylogenetically closely related (Fig. 8A and 8B). We also observed strong

220

phylogenetic turnover between α-CoV strains from rhinolophids and from miniopterids and all other bat

221

families, and between β-CoV strains from vespertilionids and all other bat families (Supplementary

222

Tables 28 and 29). Phylo-ordination among bat genera based on inter-genus MPD confirmed these

223

results and indicated that CoV strains from genera belonging to the same bat family were mostly more

224

closely related to each other than to genera from other families (Fig. 8C and 8D and Supplementary

225

Tables 30 and 31).

226

We observed high and positive inter-region SES MPD values between SW/HI and all other regions,

227

suggesting that these two regions host higher endemic diversity (Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 32

228

and 31). Negative inter-region SES MPD values suggested that the phylogenetic turnover among other

229

regions was less important than expected among random communities. Our phylo-ordination among

230

zoogeographic regions also reflected the high phylogenetic turnover and deep evolutionary

231

distinctiveness of both α- and β-CoVs from SW and HI regions (Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 32 and

232

33). Similar results were obtained using the random subset (Supplementary Tables 32 and 33).

233

Mantel tests

234

Mantel tests revealed a positive and significant correlation between CoV genetic differentiation (FST) and

235

geographic distance matrices, both with and without provinces including fewer than four viral

236

sequences, for α- (r = 0.25, p = 0.0097; r = 0.32, p = 0.0196; respectively) and β-CoVs (r = 0.22, p =

237

0.0095; r = 0.23, p = 0.0336; respectively). We also detected a positive and highly significant correlation

238

between CoV genetic differentiation (FST) and their host phylogenetic distance matrices, both with and

239

without genera including fewer than four viral sequences, for β-CoVs (r = 0.41, p = 0; r = 0.39, p =

240

0.0012; respectively) but not for α-CoVs (r = -0.13, p = 0.8413; r = 0.02, p = 0.5019; respectively).

Discussion

242

Our phylogenetic analysis shows a high diversity of CoVs from bats sampled in China, with most bat

243

genera included in this study (10/16) infected by both α- and β-CoVs. In our phylogenetic analysis that

244

includes all known bat-CoVs from China, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is likely derived from a clade of viruses

245

originating in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). The geographic location of this origin appears to be

246

Yunnan province. However, it is important to note that: 1) our study collected and analyzed samples

247

solely from China; 2) many sampling sites were close to the borders of Myanmar and Lao PDR; and 3)

248

most of the bats sampled in Yunnan also occur in these countries, including R. affinis and R. malayanus,

249

the species harboring the CoVs with highest RdRp sequence identity to SARS-CoV-220,21. For these

250

reasons, we cannot rule out an origin for the clade of viruses that are progenitors of SARS-CoV-2 that is

251

outside China, and within Myanmar, Lao PDR, Vietnam or another Southeast Asian country. Additionally,

252

our analysis shows that the virus RmYN02 from R. malayanus, which is characterized by the insertion of

253

multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein, belongs to

254

the same clade as both RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, providing further support for the natural origin of

255

SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats in the region20,21. Finally, while our analysis shows that the RdRp

256

sequences of coronaviruses from the Malayan pangolin are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, analysis

257

of full genomes of these viruses suggest that these terrestrial mammals are less likely to be the origin of

258

SARS-CoV-2 than Rhinolophus spp. bats22,23.

259

This analysis also demonstrates that a significant amount of cross-species transmission has occurred

260

among bat hosts over evolutionary time. Our Bayesian phylogeographic inference and analysis of host

261

switching showed varying levels of viral connectivity among bat hosts and allowed us to identify

262

significant host transitions that appear to have occurred during bat-CoV evolution in China.

263

We found that bats in the family Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats) played a key role in the evolution and

264

cross-species transmission history of α-CoVs. The family Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus were

265

involved in more inter-family and inter-genus highly significant host switching of α-CoVs than any other

266

family or genus. They were the greatest receivers of α-CoV host switching events and second greatest

267

donors after Miniopteridae/Miniopterus. The Rhinolophidae, together with the Hipposideridae, also

268

played an important role in the evolution of β-CoVs, being at the origin of most inter-family host

269

switching events. Chinese horseshoe bats are characterized by a distinct and evolutionary divergent α-

270

CoV diversity, while their β-CoV diversity is similar to that found in the Hipposideridae. The

271

Rhinolophidae comprises a single genus, Rhinolophus, and is the most speciose bat family after the

272

Vespertilionidae in China51, with 20 known species, just under a third of global Rhinolophus diversity,

273

mostly in Southern China35. This family likely originated in Asia52,53, but some studies suggest an African

274

origin54,55. Rhinolophid fossils from the middle Eocene (38 - 47.8 Mya) have been found in China,

275

suggesting a westward dispersal of the group from eastern Asia to Europe56. The ancient likely origin of

276

the Rhinolophidae in Asia and China in particular may explain the central role they played in the

277

evolution and diversification of bat-CoVs in this region, including SARSr-CoVs, MERS-cluster CoVs, and

278

SADSr-CoVs, which contain important human and livestock pathogens. Horseshoe bats are known to

279

share roosts with genera from all other bat families in this study57, which may also favor CoV cross-

280

species transmission from and to rhinolophids34. A global meta-analysis showing higher rates of viral

281

sharing among co-roosting cave bats supports this finding58.

282

Vespertilionid and miniopterid bats (largely within the Myotis and Miniopterus genera) also appear to

283

have been involved in several significant host switches during α-CoV evolution. However, no significant

284

transition from vespertilionid bats was identified for β-CoVs and these bats exhibit a divergent β-CoV

285

diversity compared to other bat families. Vespertilionid and miniopterid bats are characterized by strong

286

basal phylogenetic clustering but high recent CoV diversification rates, indicating a more rapid

287

evolutionary radiation of CoVs in these bat hosts. At the genus level, similar findings were observed for

288

the genera Myotis, Pipistrellus and Miniopterus.

289

A significant correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation of both α- and β-CoVs

290

has been detected, even if only a relatively small proportion of the variance is explained by geographic

291

distance. We also revealed a significant effect of host phylogeny on β-CoV evolution while it had a

292

minimal effect on α-CoV diversity. Contrary to the α-CoV phylogeny, the basal phylogenetic structure of

293

β-CoVs mirrored the phylogeny of their bat hosts, with a clear distinction between the Yangochiroptera,

294

encompassing the Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae, and the Yinpterochiroptera, which includes the

295

megabat family Pteropodidae and the microbat families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae, as

296

evidenced in recent bat phylogenies52,59. These findings suggest a profound co-macroevolutionary

297

process between β-CoVs and their bat hosts, even if host switches also occurred throughout their

298

evolution as our study showed. The phylogenetic structure of α-CoVs, with numerous and closely related

299

lineages identified in the Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae, contrasts with the β-CoV

300

macroevolutionary pattern and suggests α-CoVs have undergone an adaptive radiation in these two

301

Yangochiroptera families. Our BSSVS procedure and Markov jump estimates revealed higher

302

connectivity, both qualitatively and quantitatively, among bat families and genera in the α-CoV cross-

303

species transmission history. Larger numbers of highly significant host transitions and higher rates of

304

switching events along these pathways were inferred for α- than β-CoVs, especially at the host family

305

level. These findings suggest that α-CoVs are able to switch hosts more frequently and between more

306

distantly related taxa, and that phylogenetic distance among hosts represents a higher constraint on

307

host switches for β- than α-CoVs. This is supported by more frequent dispersal events in the evolution of

308

α- than β-CoVs in China.

309

Variation in the extent of host jumps between α and β-CoVs within the same hosts in the same

310

environment may be due to virus-specific factors such as differences in receptor usage between α- and

311

β-CoVs60-62. Coronaviruses use a large diversity of receptors, and their entry into host cells is mediated

312

by the spike protein with an ectodomain consisting of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-

313

fusion subunit S263. However, despite differences in the core structure of their S1 receptor binding

314

domains (RBD), several α- and β-CoV species are able to recognize and bind to the same host

315

receptors64. Other factors such as mutation rate, recombination potential, or replication rate might also

316

be involved in differences in host switching potential between α- and β-CoVs. A better understanding of

317

receptor usage and other biological characteristics of these bat-CoVs may help predict their cross-

318

species transmission and zoonotic potential.

319

We also found that some bat genera were infected by a single CoV genus: Miniopterus (Miniopteridae)

320

and Murina (Vespertilionidae) carried only α-CoVs, while Cynopterus, Eonycteris, Megaerops

321

(Pteropodidae) and Pipistrellus (Vespertilionidae) hosted only β-CoVs. This was found despite using the

322

same conserved pan-CoV PCR assays for all specimens screened and it can’t be explained by differences

323

in sampling effort for these genera (Supplementary Table 1): for example, >250 α-CoV sequences but no

324

β-CoV were discovered in Miniopterus bats in China during our recent fieldwork. These migratory bats,

325

which seem to have played a key role in the evolution of α-CoVs, share roosts with several other bat

326

genera hosting β-CoVs in China57, suggesting high likelihood of being exposed to β-CoVs. Biological or

327

ecological properties of miniopterid bats may explain this observation and clearly warrant further

328

investigation.

329

Our Bayesian ancestral reconstructions revealed the importance of South western and Southern China

330

as centers of diversification for both α- and β-CoVs. These two regions are hotspots of CoV phylogenetic

331

diversity, harboring evolutionarily old and phylogenetically diverse lineages of α- and β-CoVs. South

332

western China acted as a refugium during Quaternary glaciation for numerous plant and animal species

333

including several bat species, such as Rhinolophus affinis65, Rhinolophus sinicus66, Myotis davidii67, and

334

Cynopterus sphinx68. The stable and long-term persistence of bats and other mammals throughout the

335

Quaternary may explain the deep macroevolutionary diversity of bat-CoVs in these regions69. Several

336

highly significant and ancient CoV dispersal routes from these two regions have been identified in this

337

study. Other viruses, such as the Avian Influenza A viruses H5N6, H7N9 and H5N1, also likely originated

338

in South western and Southern Chinese regions70,71.

339

Our findings suggest that bat host diversity is not the main driver of CoV diversity in China and that

340

other ecological or biogeographic factors may influence this diversity. Overall, there were no significant

341

correlations between CoV phylogenetic diversity and bat species diversity (total or sampled) for each

342

province or biogeographic region, apart from a weak correlation between β-CoV phylogenetic diversity

343

and the number of bat species sampled at the province level. Yet, we observed higher than expected

344

phylogenetic diversity in several southern provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Hunan). These results and main

345

conclusions are consistent and robust even when we account for geographic biases in sampling effort by

346

analyzing random subsets of the data.

347

Despite being the most exhaustive study of bat-CoVs in China, this study had several limitations that

348

must be taken into consideration when interpreting our results. First, only partial RdRp sequences were

349

generated in this study and used in our phylogenetic analysis as the non-invasive samples (rectal

350

swabs/feces) collected in this study prevented us from generating longer sequences in many cases. The

351

RdRp gene is a suitable marker for this kind of study as it reflects vertical ancestry and is less prone to

352

recombination than other regions of the CoV genome such as the spike protein gene16,72. While using

353

long sequences is always preferable, our phylogenetic trees are well supported and their topology

354

consistent with trees obtained using longer sequences or whole genomes30,73. Second, most sequences

355

in this study were obtained by consensus PCR using primers targeting highly conserved regions. Even if

356

this broadly reactive PCR assay designed to detect widely variant CoVs has proven its ability to detect a

357

large diversity of CoVs in a wide diversity of bats and mammals30,74-77, we may not rule out that some

16

358

bat-CoV variants remained undetected. Using deep sequencing techniques would allow to detect this

359

unknown and highly divergent diversity.

360

In this study, we identified the host taxa and geographic regions that together define hotspots of CoV

361

phylogenetic diversity and centers of diversification in China. These findings may provide a strategy for

362

targeted discovery of bat-borne CoVs of zoonotic or livestock infection potential, and for early detection

363

of bat-CoV outbreaks in livestock and people, as proposed elsewhere78. Our results suggest that future

364

sampling and viral discovery should target two hotspots of CoV diversification in Southern and South

365

western China in particular, as well as neighboring countries where similar bat species live. These

366

regions are characterized by a subtropical to tropical climate; dense, growing and rapidly urbanizing

367

populations of people; a high degree of poultry and livestock production; and other factors which may

368

promote cross-species transmission and disease emergence78-80. Additionally, faster rates of evolution in

369

the tropics have been described for other RNA viruses which could favor cross-species transmission of

370

RNA viruses in these regions81. Both SARS-CoV and SADS-CoV emerged in this region, and several bat

371

SARSr-CoVs with high zoonotic potential have recently been reported from there, although the dynamics

372

of their circulation in wild bat populations remain poorly understood16,61. Importantly, the closest known

373

relative of SARS-CoV-2, a SARS-related virus, was found in a Rhinolophus sp. bat in this region20,

374

although it is important to note that our survey was limited to China, and that the bat hosts of this virus

375

also occur in nearby Myanmar and Lao PDR. The significant public health and food security implications

376

of these outbreaks reinforces the need for enhanced, targeted sampling and discovery of novel CoVs.

377

Because intensive sampling has not, to our knowledge, been undertaken in countries bordering

378

southern China, these surveys should be extended to include Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Vietnam, and

379

perhaps across southeast Asia. Our finding that Rhinolophus spp. are most likely to be involved in host-

380

switching events makes them a key target for future longitudinal surveillance programs, but surveillance

381

targeted the genera Hipposideros and Aselliscus may also be fruitful as they share numerous β-CoVs

382

with Rhinolophus bats.

383

In the aftermath of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks, β-CoVs have been the main focus of bat-

384

CoV studies in China, Africa, and Europe17,32,36,61,82. However, we have shown that α-CoVs have a higher

385

propensity to switch host within their natural bat reservoirs, and therefore also have a high cross-

386

species transmission potential and risk of spillover. This is exemplified by the recent emergence of SADS-

387

CoV in pigs in Guangdong province17. Two human α-CoVs, NL63 and 229E, also likely originated in

388

bats27,28, reminding us that past spillover events from bat species can readily be established in the

389

human population. Future work discovering and characterizing the biological properties of bat α-CoVs

390

may therefore be of potential value for public and livestock health. Our study, and recent analysis of

391

viral discovery rates83, suggest that a substantially wider sampling and discovery net will be required to

392

capture the complete diversity of coronaviruses in their natural hosts and assess their potential for

393

cross-species transmission. The bat genera Rhinolophus, Hipposideros, Myotis and Miniopterus, all

394

involved in numerous naturally-occurring host switches throughout α-CoV evolution, should be a

395

particular target for α-CoV discovery in China and across southeast Asia, with in vitro and experimental

396

characterization to better understand their potential to infect people or livestock and cause disease.

397

Methods

398

Bat sampling

399

Bat oral and rectal swabs and fecal pellets were collected from 2010 to 2015 in numerous Chinese

400

provinces (Anhui, Beijing, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Macau,

401

Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang). Fecal pellets were collected from tarps placed below bat

402

colonies. Bats were captured using mist nets at their roost site or feeding areas. Each captured bat was

403

stored into a cotton bag, all sampling was non-lethal and bats were released at the site of capture

404

immediately after sample collection. A wing punch was also collected for barcoding purpose. Bat-

405

handling methods were approved by Tufts University IACUC committee (proposal #G2017-32) and

406

Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences IACUC committee (proposal WIVA05201705).

407

Samples were stored in viral transport medium at -80°C directly after collection.

408

RNA extraction and PCR screening

409

RNA was extracted from 200 μl swab rectal samples or fecal pellets with the High Pure Viral RNA Kit

410

(Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted in 50 μl elution buffer and stored at -

411

80°C. A one-step hemi-nested RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to detect coronavirus RNA using a set of

412

primers targeting a 440-nt fragment of the RdRp gene and optimized for bat-CoV detection (CoV-FWD3:

413

GGTTGGGAYTAYCCHAARTGTGA; CoV-RVS3: CCATCATCASWYRAATCATCATA; CoV-FWD4/Bat:

414

GAYTAYCCHAARTGTGAYAGAGC)84. For the first round PCR, the amplification was performed as follows:

415

50°C for 30 min, 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 94°C for 20 sec, 50°C for 30 sec, 68°C

416

for 30 sec, and a final extension step at 68°C for 5 min. For the second round PCR, the amplification was

417

performed as follows: 94°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles consisting of 94°C for 20 sec, 59°C for 30 sec,

418

72°C for 30 sec, and a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were gel purified and

419

sequenced with an ABI Prism 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR products with low

420

concentration or bad sequencing quality were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) for

421

sequencing. Positive results detected in bat genera that were not known to harbor a specific CoV lineage

422

previously were repeated a second time (PCR + sequencing) as a confirmation. Species identifications

423

from the field were also confirmed and re-confirmed by cytochrome (cytb) DNA barcoding using DNA

424

extracted from the feces or swabs85. Only viral detection and barcoding results confirmed at least twice

425

were included in this study.

427

We also added bat-CoV RdRp sequences from China available in GenBank to our dataset. All sequences

428

for which sampling year and host or sampling location information was available either in GenBank

429

metadata or in the original publication were included (as of March 15, 2018). Our final datasets include

430

630 sequences generated for this study and 616 sequences from GenBank or GISAID (list of GenBank

431

and GISAID accession numbers available in Supplementary Note 1, and Supplementary Tables 34 and

432

35). Nucleotide sequences were aligned using MUSCLE and trimmed to 360 base pair length to reduce

433

the proportion of missing data in the alignments. All phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the

434

complete data and random subset, and for α- and β-CoVs separately.

435

Defining zoogeographic regions in China

436

Hierachical clustering was used to define zoogeographic regions within China by clustering provinces

437

with similar mammalian diversity45. Hierarchical cluster analysis classifies several objects into small

438

groups based on similarities between them. To do this, we created a presence/absence matrix of all

439

extant terrestrial mammals present in China using data from the IUCN spatial database86 and generated

440

a cluster dendrogram using the function hclust with average method of the R package stats. Hong Kong

441

and Macau were included within the neighboring Guangdong province. We then visually identified

442

geographically contiguous clusters of provinces for which CoV sequences are available (Fig. 1 and

443

Supplementary Fig. 1).

444

We identified six zoogeographic regions within China based on the similarity of the mammal community

445

in these provinces: South western region (SW; Yunnan province), Northern region (NO; Xizang, Gansu,

446

Jilin, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hebei and Shanxi provinces and Beijing municipality), Central

447

northern region (CN; Sichuan and Hubei provinces), Central region (CE; Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi

448

and Zhejiang provinces), Southern region (SO; Guangdong and Fujian provinces, Hong Kong, Macau and

449

Taiwan), and Hainan island (HI). Hunan and Jiangxi, clustering with the SO provinces in our dendrogram,

450

were included within the central region to create a geographically contiguous Central cluster

451

(Supplementary Fig. 1). These six zoogeographic regions are very similar to the biogeographic regions

452

traditionally recognized in China87. The three β-CoV sequences from HI were included in the SO region to

453

avoid creating a cluster with a very small number of sequences.

454

Model selection and phylogenetic analysis

455

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis were performed in BEAST 1.8.446. Sampling years were used as tip dates.

456

Preliminary analysis were run to select the best fitting combination of substitution models (HKY/GTR),

457

codon partition scheme, molecular clock (strict/lognormal uncorrelated relaxed clock) and coalescent

458

models (constant population size/exponential growth/GMRF Bayesian Skyride). Model combinations

459

were compared and the best fitting model was selected using a modified Akaike information criterion

460

(AICM) implemented in Tracer 1.688. We also used TEMPEST89 to assess the temporal structure within

461

our α- and β-CoV datasets. TEMPEST showed that both datasets did not contain sufficient temporal

462

information to accurately estimate substitution rates or time to the most recent common ancestor

463

(TMRCA). Therefore we used a fixed substitution rate of 1.0 for all our BEAST analysis.

464

All subsequent BEAST analysis were performed under the best fitting model including a HKY substitution

465

model with two codons partitions ((1+2), 3), a strict molecular clock and a constant population size

466

coalescent model. Each analysis was run for 2.5 x 108 generations, with sampling every 2 x 104 steps. All

467

BEAST computations were performed on the CIPRES Science Getaway Portal90. Convergence of the chain

468

was assessed in Tracer so that the effective sample size (ESS) of all parameters was > 200 after removing

469

at least 10% of the chain as burn-in.

470

Ancestral state reconstruction and transition rates

471

A Bayesian discrete phylogeographic approach implemented in BEAST 1.8.4 was used to reconstruct the

472

ancestral state of each node in the phylogenetic tree for three discrete traits: host family, host genus
21

473

and zoogeographic region. An asymmetric trait substitution model was applied. These analyses were

474

performed for each trait on the complete dataset and random subsets. Maximum clade credibility (MCC)

475

tree annotated with discrete traits were generated in TreeAnnotator and visualized using the software

476

SpreaD391.

477

For each analysis, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) was applied to estimate the

478

significance of pairwise switches between trait states using Bayesian Factor (BF) as a measure of

479

statistical significance47. BF were computed in SpreaD3. BF support was interpreted according to Jeffreys

480

196192 (BF > 3: substantial support, BF > 10: strong support, BF > 30: very strong support, BF > 100:

481

decisive support) and only strongly supported transitions were presented in most figures, following a

482

strategy used in other studies93,94. We also estimated the count of state switching events (Markov

483

jumps)48,49 along the branches of the phylogenetic tree globally (for the three discrete traits) and for

484

each strongly supported (BF > 10) transition between character states (for bat families and ecoregions

485

only). Convergence of the MCMC runs was confirmed using Tracer. The rate of state switching events

486

per unit of time was estimated for each CoV genus by dividing the total estimated number of state

487

switching events by the total branch length of the MCC tree.

488

To assess the phylogenetic relationships among SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs from the Sarbecovirus

489

subgenus, we also reconstructed a MCC tree in BEAST 1.8.4 and median-joining network in Network

490

10.095 including all Sarbecovirus sequences, two sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in humans (GenBank

491

accession numbers: MN908947 and MN975262), one sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank accession

492

number: NC_004718), eight sequences from Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (GISAID accession

493

numbers: EPI_ISL_410538-410544, EPI_ISL_410721) and one from Rhinolophus malayanus (GISAID

The Mean Phylogenetic Distance (MPD) and the Mean Nearest Taxon Distance (MNTD) statistics50 and

497

their standardized effect size (SES) were calculated for each zoogeographic region, bat family and genus

498

using the R package picante96. MPD measures the mean phylogenetic distance among all pairs of CoVs

499

within a host or a region. It reflects phylogenetic structuring across the whole phylogenetic tree and

500

assesses the overall divergence of CoV lineages in a community. MNTD is the mean distance between

501

each CoV and its nearest phylogenetic neighbor in a host or region, and therefore it reflects the

502

phylogenetic structuring closer to the tips and shows how locally clustered taxa are. SES MPD and SES

503

MNTD values correspond to the difference between the phylogenetic distances in the observed

504

communities versus null communities. Low and negative SES values denote phylogenetic clustering, high

505

and positive values indicate phylogenetic over-dispersion while values close to 0 show random

506

dispersion. The SES values were calculated by building null communities by randomly reshuffling tip

507

labels 1000 times along the entire phylogeny. Phylogenetic diversity computations were performed on

508

both the complete dataset and random subset for each trait. A linear regression analysis was performed

509

in R to assess the correlation between CoV phylogenetic diversity (MPD) and bat species richness in

510

China. Total species richness per province or region was estimated using data from the IUCN spatial

511

database while sampled species richness corresponds to the number of bat species sampled and tested

512

for CoV per province or region in our datasets.

513

The inter-region and inter-host values of MPD (equivalent to phylogenetic β diversity), corresponding to

514

the mean phylogenetic distance among all pairs of CoVs from two distinct hosts or regions, and their SES

515

were estimated using the function comdist of the R package phylocomr97. The matrices of inter-region

516

and inter-host MPD were used to cluster zoogeographic regions and bat hosts in a dendrogram

517

according to their evolutionary similarity (phylo-ordination) using the function hclust with complete

518

linkage method of the R package stats (R core team). These computations were performed on both the

519

complete dataset and random subset.

Mantel tests and isolation by distance

521

Mantel tests performed in ARLEQUIN 3.598 were used to compare the matrix of viral genetic

522

differentiation (FST) to matrices of host phylogenetic distance and geographic distance in order to

523

evaluate the role of geographic isolation and host phylogeny in shaping CoV population structure. The

524

correlation between these matrices was assessed using 10,000 permutations. To gain more resolution

525

into the process of evolutionary diversification, these analyses were also performed at the host genus

526

and province levels. To calculate phylogenetic distances among bat genera, we reconstructed a

527

phylogenetic tree including a single sequence for all bat species included in our dataset. Pairwise

528

patristic distances among tips were computed using the function distTips in the R package adephylo99.

529

We then averaged all distances across genera to create a matrix of pairwise distances among bat

530

genera. Pairwise Euclidian distances were measured between province centroids and log transformed.

531

Mantel tests were performed with and without genera and provinces including less than four viral

532

sequences to assess the impact of low sample size on our results.

533

Data availability

535

included in our analysis are available in the Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 34 and 35.
