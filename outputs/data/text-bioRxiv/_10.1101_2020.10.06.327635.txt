Abstract

23

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-

24

nCoV) has spread quickly worldwide, with more than 29 million cases and 920,000 deaths.

25

Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow

26

their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a

27

target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine

28

(CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially

29

be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as

30

therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved

31

emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated

32

mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy,

33

against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two

34

SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism,

35

we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2,

36

blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic

37

vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed

38

autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was

39

associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our study

40

highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis

41

that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

45

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

46

2/2019-nCoV, also called coronavirus disease of 2019, Covid-19) has spread quickly worldwide

47

and has qualified as a pandemic (1). As of October 2020, more than 29 million cases and 927,000

48

deaths have been reported worldwide (World Health Organization data). SARS-CoV-2 infection

49

leads to a range of symptoms from mild fever to acute respiratory distress syndrome classifying

50

this disease into several clinical categories, including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and

51

critical infection (2).

52

Thus, there is an urgent need for a safe and powerful, accessible and affordable drug to

53

prevent and control early disease, restrain, and slow the epidemic. To date, researchers have

54

reported at least 87 drugs as potential Covid-19 therapies. Among them, 68 were tested in vitro

55

and several are in clinical testing or under preclinical development after receiving FDA (Food and

56

Drug Administration) approval (3). To date, 3,328 clinical trials concerning Covid-19 disease are

57

underway worldwide (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Among the investigated molecules, most are

58

therapeutic repositioning compounds such as chloroquine (CQ), an older FDA-approved anti-

59

malaria drug, baricitinib, dexamethasone, or the experimental anti-Ebola virus drug remdesivir

60

(4) that has recently been given emergency approval as a Covid-19 treatment.

61

The diversion of the autophagy mechanism by viruses, including coronaviruses, allows for

62

viral replication (5). More specifically, coronaviruses were found to use double membrane

63

vesicles to enhance the efficiency of virus replication (6). Additionally, it has been suggested that

64

coronaviruses induce autophagy (7), although the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be

65

determined. During the Covid-19 global pandemic, researches turned to autophagy inhibitors as

66

a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CQ and

67

hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, are autophagy inhibitors and efficient against a

68

large variety of pathologies, including cancer, malaria and systemic lupus erythematous, and they

69

have also been shown to have antiviral effects in vitro (8). Both were reported to have an effect

70

on lysosomes by inhibiting the pH-dependent replication steps of several viruses, including

71

flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (9). It turned out that the

72

autophagy mechanism acts as an antiviral defense in the early step of viral infection (5).

73

Our team developed an autophagy inhibitor, GNS561, which is a small basic lipophilic

74

molecule that induces lysosomal dysregulation, as proven by the inhibition of late-stage

75

autophagy (10). GNS561 is currently in development for oncology indications (NCT03316222)

76

and it is being tested in a clinical trial of patients infected by Covid-19 (NCT04333914). The

77

objectives of the current study were i) to evaluate the in vitro antiviral activity of GNS561 against

78

SARS-CoV-2, ii) to assess the mechanism of blocking the viral replication by inhibition of

79

autophagy, and iii) to demonstrate a synergistic combination with remdesivir.

Materials and Methods

81

Cell culture and virus

82

Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney, American Type Culture Collection ATCC® CRL-

83

1586™) were cultured using Minimum Essential Media (MEM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,

84

USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and 1% L-

85

glutamine (Life Technologies). Cells were maintained at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 and

86

95% air in a humidified incubator.

87

SARS-CoV-2 strains, IHU-MI3 -MI6 and USA-WA1/2020 were provided by the IHU

88

Mediterranean Infection and BEI Resources (Manassas, VA), respectively. Both viral strains were

89

propagated in the Vero E6 cell line and titrated by the TCID50 method followed by storage of

90

aliquots at -80°C until further use in the experiments.

91
92

In vitro cytotoxicity assay

93

Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay following

94

the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The luminescence was recorded

95

using an Infinite F200 Pro plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Cytotoxicity was

96

expressed as the concentration of test compounds that inhibited cell proliferation by 50% (CC50)

97

and calculated using the Chou and Talalay method (11). Every analysis was performed in

98

technical triplicate, and three independent experiments were performed.

99
100

Antiviral Activity Assay

101

A confluent monolayer of Vero E6 cells prepared in a 96-wells cell culture microplate was followed

102

by treatment either with GNS561, CQ, remdesivir (0.1-50 µM for GNS561 and remdesivir, 0-200

103

µM for CQ), or vehicle control for 2 hours. Treated cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2

104

(USA-WA1/2020 and IHU-MI3 -MI6) at an MOI of 0.1 for 24h. The yield of progeny virus

105

production was assessed on supernatant of infected cells using a specific qRT-PCR. Briefly, a

106

one-step qRT-PCR was conducted in a final volume of 25 μL containing 5µL of extracted viral

107

RNA from the SuperScriptTM III PlatiniumTM One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies), 20 µL of

108

a mix containing the probe/primer mix (Table 1), and Super Script master mix (Life Technologies).

109

Quantitative PCR measurement was performed using the Cobas z 480 PCR system (Roche,

110

Bâle, Switzerland). Data were analyzed with the LightCycler 480 SW 1.5 software (Roche)

111

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fold changes were calculated as the relative expression

112

of the E gene after normalizing to both infected and untreated cells. A melting curve analysis was

113

performed after amplification to verify the accuracy of the amplicon. Every analysis was

114

performed in technical triplicate, and three independent experiments were performed.

116

Cell imaging

117

The autophagy flux of the cells was investigated in infected or non-infected Vero E6 cells by two

118

different techniques. First, the autophagy was investigated by immunofluorescence. Vero E6 cells

119

cultured on coverslips were initially treated or not by a fluorescent analog of GNS561, GNS561G,

120

for 2 hours and were then infected by SARS-CoV-2 (IHU-MI6, MOI 0.1). After that, cultured cells

121

were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were washed

122

again with PBS and blocked with 1× PBS supplemented with 5% FBS (blocking buffer) for 25 min

123

at room temperature (RT), followed by a permeabilization step with 3% TritonTM X-100 (Sigma

124

Aldrich) for an additional 5 min in the blocking buffer. Then, the coverslips were incubated in

125

blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature with antibodies against LC3-II (Sigma Aldrich,

126

1:200), LAMP2 (DSHB, 1:250), and SARS Spike protein (Thermo Fisher, 1:250), and with

127

Phalloïdin-647 (Life Technologies, 1:250) and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life

128

Technologies, 1:250) to reveal actin and the nucleus, respectively. The coverslips were then

129

washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min at RT in 1:1000 diluted secondary

130

antibodies. The secondary antibodies used to reveal LC3 and LAMP2 were Alexa 594-labeled

131

anti-rabbit secondary antibody and Alexa 546-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody

132

(Invitrogen, USA), respectively. Once again, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS

133

and then mounted using Mowiol (Sigma Aldrich, USA) overnight at 4°C. Fluorescence images

134

were acquired using an LSM 800 Airyscan confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a 63× oil

135

objective. Six randomly selected microscopic fields of cells were acquired and collected by Zen

136

3.0 (Blue Edition) software (Zeiss).

137

Autophagy was then investigated by electron microscopy. Vero E6 cells were fixed for at least 1

138

h with glutaraldehyde 2.5% in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. For resin embedding, the cells

139

were washed three times with a mixture of 0.2 M saccharose/0.1 M sodium cacodylate. Cells

140

were then postfixed for 1 h with 1% OsO4 diluted in 0.2 M potassium hexa-cyanoferrate (III) / 0.1

141

M sodium cacodylate solution. After three 10 min washes with distilled water, the cells were

142

gradually dehydrated with ethanol by successive 10 min baths in 30, 50, 70, 96, 100, and 100%

143

ethanol. Substitution was achieved by successively placing the cells in 25, 50, and 75% Epon

144

solutions for 15 min each. The Vero E6 cells were placed for 1 h in 100% Epon solution and in

145

fresh Epon 100% overnight under vacuum at room temperature. Polymerization occurred with

146

the cells in 100% fresh Epon for 72 hours at 60°C. All solutions used above were 0.2 µm filtered.

147

Ultrathin 70 nm sections were cut using a UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica) and placed on HR25 300

148

Mesh Copper/Rhodium grids (TAAB). Sections were contrasted according to the methods of

149

Reynolds (12). Electron micrographs were obtained on a Morgagni 268D (Philips / FEI)

150

transmission electron microscope operated at 80 keV TEM.

151
152

Western blot assay

153

The light chain 3-phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugate (LC3)-II (Sigma Aldrich, 1:3000) and

154

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Abnova, Taipei, Neihu, Taïwan, 1:5000)

155

protein expression levels were investigated by western blotting using Imager iBrightCL1000

156

(Thermo Fisher). Two hours before Covid-19 infection (IHU-MI3 strain, MOI 0.25), cells were

157

treated with 25 µL of the investigated drugs and then infected with 50 µL of virus suspension for

158

an extra 24 hours at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO 2 and 95% air in a humidified incubator.

159

During the last 2 hoursours, cells were treated or not with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1, Sigma

160

Aldrich), an autophagy flux inhibitor.

161
162

Combination assay

163

To evaluate the synergetic effect of the investigated drugs, 25,000 cells/well were seeded into

164

96-well plates, cultured overnight and then treated in triplicate with GNS561 or remdesivir, either

165

alone or in various combinations, for 26 h. Two hours after drug treatment, the cells were infected

166

with the SARS-CoV-2 IHU MI6 strain for 24 additional hours. At the end-point, antiviral effects

167

were investigated on supernatant of infected cells using CellTiter-Glo® and qPCR as described

168

below. Data were analyzed using the MacSynergyTM II Excel Spreadsheet based on the Bliss

169

Independence model as previously described (13). Briefly, this program compares the additive

170

versus synergism effect to the experimental combined-drug effect. This can be described by a

171

surface plot of peaks and valleys of synergy and antagonism values interpreted in log volumes

172

(LV) informing a quantitative measure of synergy or antagonism over the sum of the

173

concentrations tested. LV ≥20, −20< LV <20 and LV ≤−20 indicate synergy, additive effect and

174

antagonism, respectively.

Results

176

GNS561 exhibits strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2

177

As illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 2, GNS561 showed the most potent antiviral effect against

178

SARS-CoV-2 compared to CQ and remdesivir. Indeed, GNS561 exhibited a 0.006 µM median

179

effective concentration (EC50) with 2.0 µM cytotoxicity concentration (CC50), whereas CQ and

180

remdesivir presented 0.10 µM EC50 (73.2 µM CC50) and 1.2 µM EC50 (> 100 µM CC50),

181

respectively. More precisely, the GNS561 inhibitory concentration was 16 and 200 times higher

182

than CQ and remdesivir, respectively. Moreover, we confirmed the strong antiviral effect of

183

GNS561 using another SARS-CoV-2 strain (IHU-MI6). As illustrated in Table 2, GNS561

184

presented a 0.03 EC50 and 0.07 μM EC90. To summarize, our data showed that GNS561 activity

185

is higher compared to CQ and remdesivir respectively.

186
187

Antiviral activity of GNS561 is mediated by autophagy inhibition

188

First, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 repartition in the intracellular compartment of the Vero E6

189

cells using electron microscopy. We were able to distinguish (1) the entry of SARS-CoV-2 at the

190

periphery of Vero E6 cells (red arrow), (2) the presence of endocytic vesicles in the cytoplasm

191

with clathrin-coated vesicles (yellow arrow) and (3) the virus-producing cell with vacuoles filled

192

with nascent particles (red asterisk) (Fig. 2A). GNS561 treatment leads to an accumulation and

193

an increase in the volume of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of

194

multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy (Fig. 2A).

195

Based on these results, we next investigated the location of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of our

196

antiviral compound in the cellular compartments associated with the autophagy mechanism. As

197

depicted in Fig. 2B, we noted that SARS-CoV-2 was located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes similar

198

to GNS561. Next, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an increase in size of LAMP2

199

particles associated with a reorganization of intracellular LC3-II expression, also called spots (Fig.

200

2C). In a dose-dependent manner, the size of LC3-II spots increased following GNS561

201

treatment, suggesting that the way of autophagy is impacted.

202

Finally, LC3-II expression was investigated by western blotting after treatment of Vero E6 cells

203

with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1, an autophagy flux inhibitor) during the last 2 hours of the

204

experiment. As depicted in Fig. 3A, LC3-II was increased following SARS-CoV-2 infection,

205

suggesting that the infection of cells was specifically mediated by autophagic flux, as no

206

differences were observed following BafA1 treatment as a control. GNS561 treatment led to an

207

increased in LC3-II protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting effective

208

modulation of the autophagy. Moreover, the accumulation of LC3-II protein in GNS561-treated

209

cells was not enhanced in the presence of Baf-A1, confirming the specificity of GNS561 to inhibit

210

autophagy (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, normalized LC3-II protein expression was increased in SARS-

211

CoV-2-infected cells treated with GNS561 and decreased after Baf-A1 treatment, suggesting that

212

the compound altered autophagosome synthesis (Fig. 3C). Overall, our results indicate that

213

GNS561 impacts on autophagy mechanism and subsequent inhibition of viral multiplication.

214
215

GNS561 and remdesivir combination presents a powerful synergic effect against SARS-

216

CoV-2 infection in vitro

217

It has been proposed that a combination of drugs with independent mechanisms of action could

218

be an effective strategy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test this, Vero E6 cells were treated with

219

different concentrations of GNS561 or remdesivir either alone or in combination, with drug

220

synergy/antagonism assessed by the MacSynergy method. As illustrated in Fig. 4, our results

221

showed a strong synergistic effect on the antiviral activity of GNS561 at all tested concentrations

222

with remdesivir in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 μM.

224

Discussion

225

In this work, we have demonstrated that, GNS561 exhibits a much stronger antiviral effect

226

against SARS-CoV-2 compared to CQ and remdesivir. Liu. J et al. reported that CQ and

227

remdesivir efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (14). Indeed, remdesivir was found

228

to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 0.77 (14, 15). Moreover, CQ and HCQ have

229

been proposed as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (14, 16, 17). At every tested MOI (0.01,

230

0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), the EC50 for CQ (2.71, 3.81, 7.14 and 7.36 μM) was lower than that of HCQ

231

(4.51, 4.06, 17.31 and 12.96 μM). Interestingly, the EC50 values of CQ that they obtained are

232

barely higher than their previous work (from 1.13 μM to 7.36 μM). It appears that they may have

233

underscored the adaptation of the virus in cell culture that substantially increased its viral

234

infectivity upon continuous passaging. Indeed, GNS561 exhibits one of the most powerful antiviral

235

effect in vitro described in the literature so far against SARS-CoV-2.

236

Our study showed that i) SARS-CoV-2 was located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes similar

237

to GNS561. ii) SARS-CoV-2 infection led to an increase in LAMP2 particles associated with an

238

autophagy induction. Some viruses hijack the autophagy mechanism to allow their entry and

239

replication, as previously reported for SARS-CoV replication (18–22). CQ and HCQ, two

240

autophagy inhibitors, were reported to elicit antiviral activity through the alteration of endosomal

241

pH and the inhibition of lysosomal fusion to viral endosomes, leading to the reduction of viral

242

replication and the protection of cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death (7). Here, we

243

proposed GNS561, a late-stage autophagy inhibitor, as an effective antiviral compound in the

244

inhibition of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection targeting autophagy vacuoles during the

245

early steps in the viral replication cycle. Indeed, this is the first observation of autophagy vacuole

246

blockade during SARS-CoV-2 infection that shows characteristics of complexed autophagy.

247

Moreover, many mechanisms have been described to target the viral replication cycle associated

248

with lysosomotropic agent treatment have been proposed (23–25). Further investigations are

249

needed to dissect the different target mechanisms of the autophagy pathway of the GNS561 drug

250

in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

251

Today, direct active antiviral drugs are the dominant class of antiviral drugs in use. They

252

are highly successful against clinically important infections such as human immunodeficiency

253

viruses, hepatitis C virus and several others. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, recently showed

254

significant clinical results in the treatment of Covid-19 patients (26, 27). Nonetheless, obstacles

255

such as drug-resistant viruses or emerging viruses with no available selective antivirals in the

256

market call for the utilization of an armament of simple compounds that target host factors and

257

show broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Thus, there is some interest in using drug combinations

258

against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, it was recently reported that nitazoxanide in combination with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.327635; this version posted October 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

259

amodiaquine, umifenovir or remdesivir presented a significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2 (28).

260

It was also reported that remdesivir and HCQ exhibited a strong antagonism (28). Here, we

261

showed that a combination of the replication inhibitor, remdesivir with the autophagy inhibitor,

262

GNS561 demonstrated strong synergy in vitro, supporting future clinical evaluation of such

263

combination regimens. Overall, the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing

264

of drug combinations must be taken into consideration for potential therapeutic use against

265

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

266

There are conflicting data regarding the efficacy and toxicity of HCQ alone or in

267

combination for the treatment of Covid-19-positive patients (29). Of concern are the side effects

268

were reported concerning CQ treatment. Indeed, although CQ and HCQ present safety profiles

269

in clinical use, side effects have been reported, including gastrointestinal upset (30), retinal

270

toxicity (31, 32), cardiomyopathy (33) and heart rhythm disturbances (34). Compared to HCQ and

271

CQ, GNS561 presents several advantages, including no phototoxicity and no electrocardiogram

272

modification with a markedly more potent activity the SARS-CoV-2 through its anti-autophagy

273

mechanism. Interestingly, GNS561 is currently being tested in moderate Covid-19 patients in a

274

Phase II clinical study. Due to this original mechanism of action, the focus of the Covid-19 patients

275

is located is the early phase before the cytokine storm.

276

Taken together, due to the high potency of GNS561 against Covid-19 and its good safety

277

profile observed in phase II clinical trials, GNS561 constitutes a promising treatment for Covid-

278

19. In addition, considering the continuous spread of major viral pathogens as well as

279

unpredictable viral outbreaks of old or novel coronaviruses, it seems advisable to have an arsenal

280

of countermeasures ready for the prevention of global health crises.
