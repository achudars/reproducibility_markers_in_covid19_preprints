Abstract: Safe, economical and effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are needed to achieve adequate herd immunity and halt the
pandemic. We have constructed a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CoVac501, which is a selfadjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists. The vaccine
contains two immunodominant peptides screened from receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is
fully chemically synthesized. And the vaccine has optimized nanoemulsion formulation,
outstanding stability and safety. In non-human primates (NHPs), CoVac501 elicited high and
persistent titers of RBD-specific and protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which were also
effective to RBD mutations. CoVac501 was found to elicit the increase of memory T cells,
antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and Th1-biased CD4+ T cell immune responses in NHPs.
More importantly, the sera from the immunized NHPs can prevent infection of live SARS-CoV2 in vitro.
One-Sentence Summary: A novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine we developed, CoVac501,which is a
fully chemically synthesized and self-adjuvanting peptides conjugated with TLR7 agonists, can
induce high-efficient humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

Main Text:

Safe, quickly designable, protective and economical vaccines against severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are required to rapidly respond to viral mutations,
reduce the economic burden on public health and halt coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
epidemics (1-3). Epitope-specific peptide vaccines can be rapidly designed against viral proteins,
readily respond to mutations in pathogens and completely chemically synthesized on a large
scale with low production cost (4, 5).
However, the immunogenicity of peptides is relatively low (6). Coupling innate immune agonists
to form self-adjuvanting vaccine is a promising way to improve the immunogenicity of peptide
vaccines and to elicit specific antigen presentation. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a natural
immune pattern recognition receptor localized on the endo/lysosomes membrane (7). TLR7
agonists are being developed in combination with various vaccines in our and others' studies to
facilitate the antigen presentation, activate innate immunity, promote antibody affinity
maturation and maintain long-lasting immune memory (8-11).

We have developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, named CoVac501, which is a fully
chemically synthesized and self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with TLR7 agonists.
CoVac501 can induce high-level, durable and protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against
SARS-CoV-2 and RBD mutations and induce specific T cell immune responses in non-human
primates (NHPs).

Prediction and screening of peptide candidates

25

Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells through the interaction
between receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(12, 13).
Several studies have shown that the RBD is an immunodominant region in the S protein and
NAbs in the sera of convalescent patients are mostly against the RBD (14-16). Screening of
neutralizing antibody epitopes from RBD for immunization holds promise for inducing specific
and protective humoral immune responses.
Based on computer-aided vaccine design technology, we integrated the sequence and structural
features of RBD to predict and screen several immunodominant peptide candidates (Fig. 1A).

30

35

Based on NetMHCIIpan-4.0 (17), we predicted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II binding
peptides for major HLA class II types (fig. S1, A and B). The RBD contains three
immunodominant regions: residues around 345-380, 450-470 and 485-515. Consistently, these
regions also contain potential HLA class I epitopes and B-cell linear epitopes predicted by
NetMHCpan-4.1 (17) and BepiPred-2.0 (18)(fig. S1, C and D). Considering the physicochemical
properties, we selected LY54 (residues 455-508) and P67 (residues 351-378) as candidate
peptides (Fig. 1B and fig. S1E). And LY54 is positioned at the interaction interface between
RBD and ACE2 (Fig. 1C). By peptide solid-phase synthesis technique, we prepared LY54 and
P67 with high purity.
Preparation and identification of peptides conjugated with TLR7 agonists

40

By conjugating TLR7 agonists, peptides can form self-adjuvanting vaccines, which will allow
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to simultaneously uptake peptide antigens and TLR7 agonist
adjuvants to induce a potent antigen-specific immune response (19). We have developed a TLR7
small molecule agonist, named SZU-101, which has been applied in our previous studies for the
construction of self-adjuvanting vaccines (8, 9). To conjugate LY54 and P67 with SZU-101, the
N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters group and the maleimide (Mal) group were covalently

conjugated to the carboxyl group of SZU-101, respectively (Fig. 2A). LY54-101 were prepared
by coupling SZU-101-NHS with the leucine (residue 1) and lysine (residues 4 and 8) of LY54
(Fig. 2A). SZU-101-Mal was attached to the cysteine (residue 12) of P67 via a sulfhydryl group
to form P67-101 (Fig. 2A). LY54-101 and P67-101 were purified and characterized by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) to
achieve more than 95% purity (fig. S2 to S7).
Considering that the thermal stability of vaccines can greatly affect the shipping and storage
conditions, we tested the thermal stability of LY54-101 and P67-101. LY54-101 and P67-101
were placed at 4°C, 25°C and 40°C for 5 days, 10 days and 30 days, respectively. HPLC
identification results showed that no significant changes were found in the purity of LY54-101
and P67-101 at 4°C, 25°C and even 40°C for 30 days, suggesting that LY54-101 and P67-101
has outstanding thermal stability (Fig. 2, B to D).
In summary, we prepared high quality peptides conjugated with TLR7 agonists (LY54-101 and
P67-101) with prominent thermal stability through full chemical synthesis approach.

Immunogenicity of LY54-101 and P67-101
To preliminary evaluate the immunogenicity of LY54-101 and P67-101, C57BL/6 mice were
injected with LY54-101 (50 μg) and P67-101 (50 μg) mixed with Titermax adjuvant for three
doses at days 0, 7 and 14. The sera obtained 20 days after the third vaccination showed a strongly
specific antibody response against RBD in the mice, with IgG titer up to 1: 1000000 (Fig. 3A).
Notably, the sera obtained 56 days after the third vaccination still showed a RBD specific IgG
titer up to 1: 400000 (Fig. 3B). Further, the immunogenicity of LY54-101 and P67-101 was
accessed in NHP models. Cynomolgus monkeys were injected with LY54-101 (1mg) and P67101 (1mg) mixed with Titermax adjuvant for two doses at days 0 and 14 (Fig. 3C). The sera
obtained 20 days post the second vaccination showed a strongly specific antibody response
against RBD in the cynomolgus monkeys, with IgG titer up to 1: 24300 (Fig. 3D) and a NAbs
titer greater than 1:160 (Fig. 3E). Notably, the sera obtained 91 days after the second vaccination
still showed a RBD specific IgG titer up to 1: 24300 (Fig. 3F) and a NAbs titer greater than
1:320 (Fig. 3G), suggesting that the self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine induced a potent and longlasting humoral immune response.
Vaccine formulation optimization and in vivo delivery
Adjuvant formulations suitable for our self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine and available for clinical
application need to be developed to replace Titermax. Nanoemulsions formulations can protect
vaccine antigens, achieve slow release of the antigen and promote antigenic load of lymph nodes,
and have been widely used in vaccine development, such as AS03 (20). We developed two
nanoemulsion formulations (F1 and F2) and compared their adjuvant effects with AS03 and
Titermax for the in vivo delivery of our self-adjuvanting peptide vaccines.
To study the retention of vaccine formulation at injection sites, several Cy5 labeled LY54-101
formulations were intramuscularly injected into the upper inner thigh of rats, and the
fluorescence signal in inner thighs over 8 h was investigated using a live animal fluorescence
imaging system (Fig. 4A). Free LY54-101 showed little fluorescence signal 4 h post injection,
while LY54-101 nanoemulsions showed enhanced retention at injection sites (Fig. 4B). F2
nanoemulsion displayed slightly decreased fluorescence signal compared to AS03 nanoemulsion,
with more than 50% of fluorescence intensity remained at the injection sites (Fig. 4B).

Major organs were excised from rats 8 h post injection to study the biodistribution of different
LY54-101 formulations. Free LY54-101 and LY54-101 nanoemulsions showed strong
fluorescence signals both in liver and kidney, indicating that LY54-101 was mainly metabolized
through liver and kidney (Fig. 4, C and D). We next focused on the recruitment of different
LY54-101 formulations in lymph nodes. Little free LY54-101 was recruited in lymph node,
while AS03, F1 and F2 nanoemulsions enhanced the recruitment of LY54-101 in lymph node
(Fig. 4E). Notably, F2 nanoemulsion displayed the highest fluorencence intensity in lymph node
among all vaccine formulations including the Titermax (Fig. 4F). We speculated that F2
nanoemulsions for LY54-101 would obtain better immune efficacy than AS03 nanoemulsions.
In addition, we tested the thermal stability of vaccine formulations. F2 nanoemulsion formulation
and AS03 nanoemulsion formulation for LY54-101 were placed at 4°C or 40°C for 30 days,
respectively. HPLC identification results showed that no significant changes were found in the
purity of LY54-101 in both F2 nanoemulsion formulation and AS03 nanoemulsion formulation
at 4°C for 30 days (Fig. 4, G and I). Notably, LY54-101 in the AS03 nanoemulsion formulation
was degraded after one month at 40°C, while LY54-101 in the F2 nanoemulsion formulation
remained stable, revealing that the F2 nanoemulsion formulation of LY54-101 has outstanding
stability (Fig. 4, H and J).

To determine the optimized formulation composition, study the role of the TLR7 agonist in selfadjuvanting peptide vaccines and determine the ratios optimized for LY54-101 and P67-101, we
vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys with peptide vaccines in the following groups: saline, LY54101 (F2), LY54-101 (AS03), LY54-101+P67-101 (1:1, F2), LY54-101+P67-101 (2:1, F2) and
LY54+P67 (1:1, F2) (Fig. 5A). Animals received peptide vaccines via the intramuscular route for
three doses at days 0, 14 and 28, while were found to have RBD-specific binding antibodies
determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and NAbs determined by both a
competitive ELISA and a live virus neutralization assay.
Sera obtained on day 14 after the first dose of peptide vaccines already showed specific IgG
responses to the RBD, especially for the LY54-101 (AS03) group (Fig. 5B). The titer of RBDspecific binding antibodies gradually increased with two booster immunizations from day 14 to
day 35 and peaked between day 35 and day 42, while a decreasing trend was observed from day
42 to day 70 (Fig. 5, C to F and fig. S8). By comparing the changes in binding antibody levels
between the groups, we determined the composition of the vaccine formulation. First, comparing
the binding antibody titers in the LY54-101 (F2) and LY54-101 (AS03) groups, we found that
AS03 nanoemulsion could induce humoral immune responses more rapidly, but the later
antibody levels were much lower than those induced by F2 nanoemulsion, suggesting that F2
nanoemulsion is more suitable for our peptide vaccines. Second, P67-101 further increased the
production of specific antibodies to RBD, thus the optimal immunization ratio of LY54-101 and
P67-101 was 2:1. Third, by conjugating with the TLR7 agonist SZU-101, the peptide vaccines
induced a stronger and longer-lasting humoral immune response. Therefore, we identified LY54101+P67-101 (2:1, F2) as the final self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine formulation and named it
CoVac501.
Notably, the neutralizing antibody titer continued to increase and was maintained at a stable level
from day 63 to day 70, which was eventually up to 1:5120 (Fig. 5, G to K). Further, we tested the
neutralization of sera from vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys for live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by
microdose cytopathogenic efficiency (CPE) assay. Sera from CoVac501 vaccinated cynomolgus

monkeys had a neutralization titer up to 1:39 at 28 days after the third immunization (Fig. 5L).
These results indicated that the CoVac501 can induce a high level, protective and durable
humoral immune response.
Humoral immunity induced by CoVac501 against RBD mutations
5

10

Mutations in amino acid residues of the RBD may affect the effectiveness of existing vaccines
and neutralizing antibodies. We therefore tested changes in antibody titers of sera from
CoVac501 vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys against five mutant RBD proteins (N439K, Y453F,
S477N, E484K and N501Y) (Fig. 6, A to D). Sera were obtained on days 35, 56 and 70 after the
first dose of CoVac501. The results showed that RBD-specific antibody levels was not affected
by mutations of N439K, Y453F, S477N and N501Y of RBD. E484K mutation reduced the RBDspecific antibody levels by threefold, but still retained enough RBD-binding antibodies. Thus,
the binding ability of RBD-specific antibodies induced by CoVac501 was not significantly
affected by mutations at multiple loci on the RBD.
T cell immune responses in CoVac501 vaccinated Cynomolgus macaques

15

20

25

We also observed cellular immune response in CoVac501 vaccinated monkeys. T cells of
vaccinated monkeys (day 28 and day 42) were quantified by flow cytometry. CoVac501
vaccinated monkeys had fewer naive T cells (CD28+, CCR7+ and CD45RA+), more effector T
cells (CD28-, CCR7- and CD45RA+) and more memory T cells (CD28+, CCR7-and CD45RA-),
suggesting that CoVac501 vaccination would promote T-cell activation and T-cell immune
memory in cynomolgus monkeys (Fig. 7, A and B). In addition, PBMCs of vaccinated monkeys
were stimulated in vitro with either LY54 peptides or RBD. Intracellular cytokine staining assays
showed that CoVac501 induced an RBD or LY54-specific CD8+T cells responses (Fig. 7, C to
D). Meanwhile, CoVac501 induced an increase in IFN-γ+, TNF-α+ and IL-2+ CD4+ T cells
without affecting the levels of IL-4+, IL-6+ and IL-10+ CD4+ T cells, indicating that CoVac501
induced Th1-biased immune responses in vaccinated monkeys (Fig. 7, E to F).
Discussion
The self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with TLR7 agonists, represented by CoVac501
we developed, is a novel form of vaccine that has the potential to be applied for COVID-19 or
other infectious diseases and can serve as a rapid response strategic reserve for future outbreaks.

CoVac501 is an epitope-based peptide vaccine. Based on computer-aided vaccine design
technology, peptide vaccines can be rapidly designed for antigenic proteins. CoVac501 contains
two RBD antigen peptides, namely LY54 and P67, which can elicit a neutralizing humoral
immune response. Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs development and spike protein
immunogenicity analysis have shown that the regions where LY54 and P67 are located contain
the most critical immunodominant and neutralizing epitopes in RBD, suggesting the rationality
of our computer-based peptide vaccine design (14, 21-25). Moreover, antigenic peptides can be
easily and economically produced on a large scale by full chemical synthesis, allowing peptide
vaccines to respond rapidly to pandemics and virus mutations. In addition, the main components
of CoVac501 have outstanding thermal stability, which makes the vaccine easier to store and
transport.
TLR7 agonists have been used as adjuvants in vaccine development (26). In vaccine
formulations, TLR7 agonists can activate innate immunity, facilitate the antigen presentation
process, promote antibody affinity maturation and maintain long-lasting immune memory (7, 11,
27, 28). CoVac501 induced a sustained increase in NAbs titers and maintained a durable humoral

immune response, which may be attributed to TLR7 agonists for promoting antibody affinity
maturation and immune memory formation. Interestingly, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is linear
single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA), which is recognized by TLR7 in innate immune
cells (12, 29, 30). Studies have shown that TLR7 expression levels and activity are lower in
males, the elderly or people with underlying diseases such as obesity, which are SARS-CoV-2
susceptible populations (31, 32). This suggests a potential association between susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 and TLR7 expression levels and activity. Adequate activation of TLR7 may also
provide protection to susceptible individuals (33).
The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has been undergoing mutations. Particularly, 501Y.V1 variant
(B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) have been widely spread and have demonstrated the potential
for immune escape against existing vaccines and neutralizing antibody drugs (34-37). There is an
urgent need to develop vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 mutant strain. Serum antibodies
induced by CoVac501 was effective to RBD with mutations in residues N439K, Y453F, S477N
and N501Y, suggesting that the 501Y.V1 variant may not show immune escape against
CoVac501. Although the mutation of E484K reduced the titer of RBD-specific antibodies
induced by CoVac501 by threefold, on the one hand CoVac501 retained enough antibodies
against the E484K RBD and on the other hand peptide vaccines can be rapidly designed to cope
with the mutation of E484K.
Our present study has some limitations that will be addressed in further research. First, the
specific role and mechanism of action of TLR7 agonist SZU-101 in the immune effect of
CoVac501 remains to be investigated, especially how TLR7 agonists promote antibody affinity
maturation and immune memory formation in humoral immunity in vivo. Second, the
components and involving mechanism related to lymph node aggregation and better in vivo
immune effect of the peptide vaccine caused by F2 nanoemulsion rather than AS03
nanoemulsion also remains to be elucidated.
In conclusion, we have developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine CoVac501, which is a selfadjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with TLR7 agonists. CoVac501 is a fully chemically
synthesized vaccine with outstanding thermal stability and optimized nanoemulsion formulation.
CoVac501 can induce high level, protective and long-lasting neutralizing humoral immune
responses and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in NHPs. Besides, CoVac501 was resistant
to multiple mutations of amino acid residues in RBDs. CoVac501 holds great potential for
further clinical development and application.

Materials and Methods
Animals and study design.
Animal husbandry was performed as previous work (1). All animal studies were conducted in an
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International
(AAALAC) accredited Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) facility. Standard primate diet
(purchased from Beijing Keao xieli Feed) was provided daily in amounts appropriate for the ages
and sizes of the animals. Reverse osmosis water was made available ad libitum to each animal
via an automatic watering device. The animals were provided additional supplements as a form
of environmental enrichment and were given various cage-enrichment devices. The animals were
maintained on a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle in rooms maintained at 20℃ to 26℃ with a relative
humidity of 40% to 70%.
In the immunogenicity evaluation of peptide vaccines in mice, female C57BL/6 mice (n = 5)
were injected intramuscularly with LY54-101 (50 μg) and P67-101 (50 μg) mixed with Titermax
adjuvant or saline for three doses at days 0, 7 and 14. Sera were collected at regular intervals for
antibody detection.
In the first immunogenicity evaluation of peptide vaccines in monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys (n
= 2) were injected intramuscularly with LY54-101 (1mg) and P67-101 (1mg) mixed with
Titermax adjuvant or saline for two doses at days 0 and 14. Sera were collected at regular
intervals for antibody detection.
In the second immunogenicity evaluation of peptide vaccines in monkeys, we vaccinated
cynomolgus monkeys with peptide vaccines in the following groups: saline, LY54-101 (2mg,
F2), LY54-101 (2mg, AS03), LY54-101+P67-101 (1:1, 2mg+2mg, F2), LY54-101+P67-101
(2:1, 2mg+1mg, F2) and LY54+P67 (1:1, 2mg+2mg, F2) for three doses at days 0,14 and 28.
Sera and PBMCs were collected at regular intervals for antibody detection and immune response
assays.
Prediction of immunodominant peptide epitopes.
The amino acid sequence of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from the Uniprot
database (P0DTC2). The sequence of the RBD was extracted from residues 319 to 541 of the
Spike protein. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II binding peptides of RBD for major
HLA class II types (DRB1*07:01, DRB1*03:01, DRB1*15:01, DRB1*11:01, DRB1*01:01,
DRB1*13:02, DRB1*13:01, DRB1*04:01, DRB1*11:04, DRB1*04:04, DRB1*15:02,
DRB1*09:01, DRB1*14:01, DRB1*01:02, DRB1*15:03, DRB1*12:01, DRB1*04:05,
DRB1*10:01, DRB1*04:07 and DRB1*04:03) were predicted by NetMHCIIpan-4.0 (2). The
HLA class I binding peptides of RBD for major HLA class I types were predicted by
NetMHCpan-4.1 (2). B-cell linear epitopes of RBD were predicted by BepiPred-2.0 (3). Crystal
structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound with ACE2 was from Protein Data Bank (PDB; code
6M0J).
Synthesis of SZU-101 derivatives and SZU-101-peptide conjugations.
Reagents and instrument
SZU-101 was synthesized as previously reported work (4). EDCI, NHS and 1-(2-Aminoethyl)1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate were purchased from Bidepharm (Shanghai, China).
DMF, DMSO and NaHCO3 were purchased from Sinopharm (Shanghai, China). Trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) and acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from J&K (Shanghai, China). Peptides LY54
and P67 were synthesized by JYMedtech (Shenzhen, China). All chemicals and solvents were

mg/mL. For HPLC analysis, 10 μL of aliquots was subjected and the column was eluted by a
linear gradient of 2-90% acetonitrile in 30 min at 1.0 mL/min, 40 ℃.
Preparation and Characterization of vaccine nanoemulsions.
Peptide vaccines were dissolved in squalene (2.1%) and alpha-tocopherol (2.4%) to form a
homogeneous oil phase, which accounted for 4.5% by volume in nanoemulasion. Tween-80 as
an emulsifier was dissolved in oil phase and mixed uniformly. The PBS buffer as water phase
was mixed with the oil phase using the Scientz-IId Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor (Ningbo scientz
biotechnology Co., China) to form AS03 nanoemulsions with PDC vaccine concentration of 2
mg/mL. To enhance solubility of peptide vaccines, the amount of squalene increased to 2.5% to
prepare F1 nanoemulsions. All other materials and procedures were the same as described in the
preparation of AS03 nanoemulsions. To improve retention of peptide vaccines at the injection
site, polylactic acid (PLA) block copolymer was added to water phase to prepare F2 emulsion on
the basis of F1 nanoemulsions prescription. The particle size of three nanoemulsions was
determined by a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS analyzer (Worcestershire, UK).
Bioditribution and retention of vaccine nanoemulsions in vivo.
To evaluate the retention of peptide vaccines nanoemulsions at injection site, Cy5 labeled
peptide vaccines nanoemulsions were intramuscularly injected into the upper inner thigh of rats
after hair removal. At 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h postinjection, the rats were imaged by the IVIS Spectrum
System (Caliper Corp. Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). After 8 h of injection, the main organs
(hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, and kidneys) and lymph nodes were collected for imaging to study
the biodistribution of nanoemulsions in tissues. The fluorescence intensity of nanoemulsions at
injection sites and various tissues was analyzed quantitatively with a region of interest (ROI)
tool.
RBD binding antibody assay.
RBD binding antibodies were measured by standard ELISA methods. 96-well ELISA plates
(Nunc) were coated with RBD-His (1 μg/mL) in PBS overnight at 4°C. After being washed three
times with PBST buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), 96-well plates were blocked with 200 μL
of 1% BSA solution for one hours at 37°C with shaking set at 650 rpm. After being washed, 96well plates were added with 100 μL of serial dilutions of sera and incubated for one hour at 37°C
with shaking set at 650 rpm. After being washed, 96-well plates were incubated with 100 μL of
Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (HRP, GenScript, 1:5000) for one hour at 37°C with shaking
set at 650 rpm. After being washed, 96-well plates were incubated with 100 μL of tetramethyl
benzidine (TMB) substrate solution (KPL) at 37°C with shaking set at 650 rpm for 20 min. The
reaction was terminated by adding 2 M of sulfuric acid solution, and the absorbance value was
measured at 450 nm with an automatic microplate reader SpectraMax (Molecular Devices).
Neutralizing antibody assay.
NAbs for blocking RBD/ACE2 interaction were detected by the SARS-CoV-2 sVNT Kit
(GenScript). Briefly, the samples and controls are pre-incubated with the HRP-RBD to allow the
binding of the circulating neutralization antibodies to HRP-RBD. The mixture is then added to
the capture plate which is pre-coated with the hACE2 protein. The unbound HRP-RBD as well
as any HRP-RBD bound to non-neutralizing antibody will be captured on the plate, while the
circulating neutralization antibodies/HRP-RBD complexes remain in the supernatant and get

removed during washing. After washing steps, TMB solution is added, making the color blue. By
adding Stop Solution, the reaction is quenched and the color turns yellow. This final solution can
be read at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader. The absorbance of the sample is inversely
dependent on the titer of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.
Live virus neutralization assay.
Cytopathogenic efficiency (CPE) assay was performed as previous work (5). The SARS-CoV-2
virus was seeded and propagated in VERO E6 cells. VERO E6 cells were acquired from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Meilunbio) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life
Technologies) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Serum samples were heatinactivated for 30 minutes at 56℃; two-fold serial dilutions, starting from 1:4, were then mixed
with an equal volume of viral solution containing 100 of 50% tissue culture
infective dose (TCID50) for SARS-CoV-2. The serum-virus mixture was incubated for 1 hour at
37℃ in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After incubation, 100 µL of the mixture at each
dilution was added in duplicate to a cell plate containing a semi-confluent VERO E6 monolayer.
The plates were incubated for 4 days at 37°C. After 4 days of incubation, cytopathic effect (CPE)
of each well was recorded under microscopes. The highest serum dilution that protected more
than the 50% of cells from CPE was taken as the neutralization titer.
T cell immune immunophenotyping.
PBMCs were isolated from cynomolgus monkeys blood by lymphocyte separation solution
(Dakewei) and added to 96-well plates (1×106 cells/mL) for culture. Samples were firstly
blocked with 4% FBS and anti-CD16/CD32 (FcγRIII/FcγRII, 2.4G2, BD Biosciences), then
incubated with surface marker antibodies for 25 minutes at 4℃ and then permeabilized with BD
Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer before intracellular labeling antibodies were added for 30 minutes at
4℃. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using ACEA NovoCyte. Cellular events were first
gated by forward and side scatter characteristics and then by characteristic fluorescence. Data
processing was done through NovoExpress software. Antibody staining of cells for flow
cytometry analysis was performed following the antibody manufacturer’s recommendations. The
antibodies used in T cell immunophenotyping include FITC Mouse Anti-Human CD3ε Clone
SP34 (BD Biosciences), APC Mouse Anti-Human CD28 Clone CD28.2 (BD Biosciences), PECy7 Mouse Anti-Human CD45RA Clone 5H9 (BD Biosciences) and Brilliant Violet 650 antihuman CD197 (CCR7) Antibody (Biolegend).
T cell immune responses assay.
PBMCs were isolated from cynomolgus monkeys blood by lymphocyte separation solution and
added to 96-well plates (1×106 cells/mL) for culture. PBMCs and 40 μg/mL of LY54 or RBD
were co-incubated for 8 hours and cytokine secretion was simultaneously blocked with BFA (BD
Biosciences). Samples were firstly blocked with 4% FBS and anti-CD16/CD32 (FcγRIII/Fcγ
RII, 2.4G2), then incubated with surface marker antibodies for 25 minutes at 4℃ and then
permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer before intracellular labeling antibodies were
added for 30 minutes at 4℃. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using ACEA NovoCyte.
