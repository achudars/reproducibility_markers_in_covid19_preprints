Abstract:
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has posed a serious challenge to public health system
and vaccination programs across the globe. We have studied the pathogenicity and virus
shedding pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 and compared with D614G variant in
5

Syrian hamsters. VOC 202012/01 could produce disease in hamsters characterized by body
weight loss and respiratory tract tropism but mild lung pathology. Further, we also documented
that neutralizing antibodies developed against VOC 202012/01 could equally neutralize D614G
variant. Higher load of VOC 202012/01 in the nasal wash specimens was observed during the
first week of infection outcompeting the D614G variant. The findings suggest increased fitness

10

of VOC 202012/01 to the upper respiratory tract which could lead to higher transmission.
Further investigations are needed to understand the transmissibility of new variants.
One-Sentence Summary: SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 infected hamsters demonstrated high
viral RNA shedding through the nasal secretions and significant body weight loss with mild lung
pathology compared to the D614G variant.

Main text
Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has significantly
impacted the global healthcare and economy (1). Rapid spread of the virus, non-availability of
5

any treatment or vaccines and insufficient healthcare facilities posed challenges in the beginning
of the pandemic. Research on development of countermeasures against the disease was initiated
in no time and now several vaccines are available across the globe like BNT162b2, mRNA-1273,
ChAdOx1-S [recombinant], COVAXIN etc. (2, 3). The high mutation rate in RNA viruses helps
them swiftly adapt to diverse environmental conditions posing a greater challenge in their

10

prevention and control (4, 5). The continuous genomic surveillance of the circulating SARSCoV-2 worldwide has given us clues about the genetic mutations acquired by the virus. The
identification of such variants with potential of high transmission, disease severity, immunity
evasion, resistance to therapeutic measures and ability to evade diagnostic tests is imperative to
control the pandemic (6). Recently, various new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been reported

15

worldwide which are of serious concern (7, 8).
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus
Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. Its genome size is approximately 30 kbps,
encoding different structural and non-structural proteins essential for the virus (9). The SARSCoV-2 strains circulating during the early pandemics have been superseded with new variant

20

strains (7, 10). Initially, SARS-CoV-2 strains with D614G mutation in the spike glycoprotein
became predominant worldwide (11). This strain was associated with high viral loads in the
upper respiratory tract than the earlier strains but didn’t produce severe disease (12). Recently,
various viral strains of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations of concern like VOC 202012/01 (B.1.1.7

lineage) from the United Kingdom, VOC 202012/02 (B.1351 lineage) from South Africa, VOC
202101/02 (P.1) from Brazil, VOC 202102/02 i.e., a B.1.1.7 cluster with E484K mutation from
the United Kingdom were reported (7, 8). Among this, VOC 202012/01 (B.1.1.7 lineage) from
the United Kingdom defined by a range of 23 mutations, resulting in amino acid changes and
5

three deletions in the virus has spread to 94 countries as of 16th February 2021 with local
transmission in at least 47 countries (7, 13). This variant has amino acid changes in the spike
protein that included deletions (69/70,144Y) and replacements (N501Y, A570D, D614G, and
P681H). The N501Y mutation in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) has been found to
increase the binding affinity to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor by 10 times higher

10

than that of the wild type RBD, which could increase the infectivity and transmissibility of the
virus (14). Amino acid at position 501 which is in the RBD can possibly affect the efficacy of
virus neutralization too as RBD accounts for 90% neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2
(15). The cumulative effect of all these mutations are still unknown and the initial reports from
phylogenetic and transmission model analysis indicated that some of these mutations may

15

influence the transmissibility of the virus in humans (16). The preliminary analysis data
published by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG)
shows that there could be an increase in the risk of death associated with VOC 202012/01 variant
compared to other non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 (17).
VOC 202012/02 reported from South Africa is characterized by spike protein mutations, K417N,

20

E484K, N501Y, D614G and L242/A243/L244 deletions. Till date, the variant has been reported
from 46 countries (8, 18). Another VOC was also reported from Brazil (20J/501Y.V3) belonging
to P1 lineage causing the surge of infections (10). Recently, another VOC was reported from
South West England called VOC 202102/02 i.e., a B.1.1.7 cluster with E484K mutation (19).

The continuous emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants is also becoming a serious threat to
efficacy of the vaccines and monoclonal antibodies developed targeting spike protein which
harbors mutations in the emerging variants. Investigations are ongoing to determine if these
variants are associated with any changes in the severity of disease and transmission. This is the
5

first study that investigated the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 strain VOC 202012/01 (B.1.1.7
lineage) in the golden (Syrian) hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model and studied the pattern of
the virus shedding of this new variant compared to the earlier SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant.

body weight loss with no apparent clinical signs (Fig.1B). Progressive body weight loss was
observed till 7 days post-infection (DPI) (mean percent decrease = -7.34%) against a 2.7% mean
15

increase in the control animals. Thereafter, a regaining trend in the body weight of hamsters from
the infected group was observed till 14 DPI. The control animals (n=4) showed a gain of 6% till

observed in the gRNA load in the nasal wash, throat swab and trachea from 3 to 14 DPI. The
gRNA peak in the lungs and nasal turbinate specimens were observed on 5th DPI which declined
further till 14 DPI. The gRNA load reached up to 8.8 x106/ml, 3.7 x 106/ml and 4.3 x 104/ml in
5

lungs, nasal turbinates and nasal wash respectively on 14 DPI. Lungs showed an average viral
titer of 104.2 and 102.6 TCID50/ml on 3 and 5 DPI respectively, whereas nasal turbinates showed
an average of 102.6, 102.5 and 102 TCID50/ml on 3, 5 and 7 DPI. No titer could be observed in
these samples at 10 and 14 DPI. Lungs and trachea samples of all hamsters were found positive
for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) on 3 DPI whereas only two out of four hamsters showed sgRNA

10

positivity in nasal wash and turbinate on 3 DPI (Fig 3F-J). Lungs samples were found to be
consistently positive for sgRNA on 5th DPI too but only one hamster was positive for the sgRNA
in the nasal wash and nasal turbinate. Other organs like small intestine, kidney, liver and brain
showed gRNA positivity from some animals on 3 and 5 DPI. However, sgRNA could not be
detected in any of these organs.

Pathological changes in lungs post infection with SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01
nd
On gross examination of organs during necropsy, lungs showed congestive changes and
hemorrhagic foci of multiple sizes from 5 DPI which persisted till 10 DPI (Fig 4A). The gross
ss
changes in the lungs appeared resolved on 14 DPI. Histopathologically, lungs showed foci of
5

consolidation and mild exudative changes on 5 DPI which progressed to mild alveolar septal
tal
thickening characterized by hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration and consolidation on 7
DPI. Lungs sections of the 10 and 14 DPI showed only focal areas of mononuclear cell
ell
infiltration and consolidation in the peribronchial region without any alveolar damage (Fig. 4B-D). Our earlier study with 1 x 104.5 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant produced more

10

severe pneumonic changes in lungs (Table S1) (20). Congestion and hemorrhages were observed

as early as 3 DPI in D614G variant infected animals and more pronounced alveolar septal

Discussion
Considering the worldwide concern and speculation of the high transmission and disease severity
5

related to VOC20212/01, we assessed the disease severity and virus shedding pattern of VOC
20212/01 in hamsters. Persistent body weight loss was observed in hamsters as reported with
other variants of SARS-CoV-2 (21–24). We could observe a significant higher percent body
weight loss in hamsters infected with same titer of VOC 202012/01 compared to D614G variant
indicating its pathogenicity. The comparable serum neutralization titer of VOC 202012/01

10

infected hamsters against heterologous virus strain is in line with the available evidence of VOC
202012/01 infected humans suggesting no strong association with escape from the natural or
vaccine acquired immunity (6, 25, 26). The IgG response was predominantly IgG2 type as
observed earlier in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant and in βpropionolactone inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (BBV152) vaccinated hamsters (20).

15

In our earlier study with SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant in hamsters, the peak gRNA load in lungs
and nasal turbinate was detected on 3 DPI and further decrease on subsequent days (22). Here,
we have observed gRNA peak in the lungs and nasal turbinate specimens on 5 DPI, indicating a
delay in virus clearance compared to the earlier strain. The virus clearance trend appeared
proportional to the increasing neutralizing antibody titer from 7 DPI. We have observed virus

20

titer in lungs and nasal turbinate only on 3 and 5 DPI in our earlier study with the D614G variant
with a higher TCID50 dose of infection (22). Here nasal turbinates showed presence of live virus
till 7 DPI indicating a longer persistence of the virus which could probably increase the window
period of transmission. sgRNA could not be detected in any of the organs other than the

respiratory tract samples substantiating the respiratory tissue tropism of the strain similar to the
earlier studied strains of SARS CoV-2. Although, we observed higher viral gRNA load in the
respiratory tract samples, only mild histopathological changes were observed in the lungs with an
inoculum of 1 x 104.5 TCID50 dose. The severity of disease reported in hamsters by SARS-CoV-2
5

varied with the dose of virus inoculums (21–24). Earlier studies have shown that even with lower
dose of virus inoculums, comparable viral RNA load was observed in 3 to 4 DPI as that of higher
dose but the lung pathological and body weight changes vary with increasing dose suggesting a
dose dependant disease severity in hamsters (20, 21, 24, 27). Even though we could observe an
increased percent body weight loss indicating the severity but lung histopathological changes

10

were not severe. This finding is in contrary to the recent reports by NERVTAG which showed
the evidences from analysis of multiple different datasets that infection with VOC 202012/01 is
associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death compared to infection with nonVOC, even though there are potential limitations in the datasets used which includes the
representativeness, potential biases in case enrolment, confounders etc (17). The amount of virus

15

shedding through the body secretions and excretions mainly contributes to the virus
transmission. The high gRNA was observed in the nasal wash samples consistently during the
first week post infection in VOC 202012/01 hamsters although comparable virus titers were
observed with both variants in these samples.
In conclusion, the intranasal infection with the SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 produced disease

20

in hamsters characterized by body weight loss, infection of the upper and lower respiratory tract
and mild lung pathology. No increased disease severity in terms of lung pathology could be
observed in hamsters as speculated in humans with VOC 202012/01 but significant decrease in
body weight was observed. There was no difference in the neutralization potential against

Experiments in Syrian hamsters
Twenty-four (12 male and 12 female) Syrian hamsters of 8-10-week-old age were used for the
pathogenicity experiment. The hamsters were housed in individually ventilated cages with ad
5

libitum food and water. Twenty hamsters were challenged with 0.1 ml of 105.5 TCID50/ml
hCoV-19/India/NIVP1 20203522/2020 (VOC 202012/01) intranasally in the containment facility
of ICMR-NIV, Pune under isoflurane anesthesia. Four hamsters were kept as mock control and
were inoculated with sterile tissue culture media. Animals were monitored daily for any clinical
signs and the body weights were monitored till 14 days. Four hamsters from each group were

10

euthanized on 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 DPI to collect blood, organ and swab samples for viral RNA
estimation, titration, histopathology, and immunological analysis.
For the comparison study of virus shedding in hamsters, twelve (6 male and 6 female) Syrian
hamsters of 8-10-week-old age were used in the study. The hamsters were housed in individually
ventilated cages with ad libitum food and water. Six hamsters (3 males and 3 females) each were

15

challenged with 0.1 ml of 105.5 TCID50/ml SARS-CoV-2 VOC-202012/01 and D614G variant
intranasally in the containment facility under isoflurane anesthesia. The animals were monitored
for any clinical signs and the body weight loss. Throat swabs, nasal wash and facecal samples
were collected in 1 ml virus transport media on every alternate DPI till 14 days for viral load
estimation.

Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR)
Nasal wash, throat swab and faecal samples were collected from hamsters in 1ml viral transport
medium. Organ samples were weighed and triturated in 1 ml sterile tissue culture media using a
tissue homogenizer (Eppendorf, Germany). Two hundred microliters of the tissue homogenate/
swab specimens were used for RNA extraction using MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid

Virus titration
The lungs, nasal turbinate, throat swab and nasal wash samples were used for virus titration in
Vero CCL-81 cells. Tissue homogenates were prepared using a tissue homogenizer (Eppendorf,
Germany) in sterile Minimum Essential Media (Gibco, USA) followed by centrifuging at 1984 g

15

for 10 minutes. The supernatant is further used for the titration. Hundred micro liters (μl )of the
tissue homogenate/ swab specimens were added onto a 24-well plate with Vero CCL81
monolayers and incubated at 37°C for one hour. The cell monolayer was washed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) post incubation after the removal of the media. The plates were
subsequently incubated with maintenance media containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a

20

CO2 incubator at 37°C. The plates were examined daily for any cytopathic effects (CPE) using
an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ti, Japan). The supernatant from the wells showing CPE
was harvested and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. The titers were calculated using the Reed
and Muench method and were expressed at TCID50/ml (33).

The serum samples collected on day 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 DPI were tested for IgG antibodies by
hamster anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. The assay procedure in brief is as follows. Ninety-six
well microtiter plates were coated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen in carbonate buffer of
pH 9.5 overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with liquid plate sealer for two hours at room
5

temperature (25-30°C) and further washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20
(PBS-T). The plates were incubated at 37°C for one hour with 100μl of diluted hamster serum
samples (1: 100). After 5 washes with PBS-T, anti-hamster IgG- horse radish peroxidase1:3000
(Thermoscientific, USA) were added and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The plate was washed
with PBS-T for five times. Hundred μl of substrate, 3’,3’5,5’- tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was

10

added to each well following the wash. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm following the
termination of color developed. Optical density of more than 0.2 and positive/negative (P/N)
ratio above 1.5 was considered positive. For antibody sub-typing, the same protocol was
followed except that of the use of biotinylated anti-Syrian hamster IgG1 /IgG2 antibodies in
1:10000 dilution (BD biosciences, USA) and Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase 1:8000

15

(Thermo-scientific, USA) for detection.
Plaque Reduction Neutralization test (PRNT)
The assay was performed using hamster serum samples collected on 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 DPI with
both strains of virus used in the study i.e., SARS-CoV-2 VOC- 202012/01 and SARS-CoV-2
D614G variant (NIV 2020-770 strain). The serum samples were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30

20

minutes in a water bath. Four- fold serial dilution of hamster serum samples were mixed with an
equal amount of virus containing a 50-60 plaque forming units/0.1 ml and were incubated at
37°C for 1 hour. 0.1 ml of this mixture was added in a 24-well tissue culture plate containing a
confluent monolayer of Vero CCL-81 cells with intermittent shaking. The plates were incubated
at 37°C for 60 minutes and the mixture was aspirated. The culture overlay medium containing

2% carboxymethyl cellulose with 2% FBS in 2X minimal essential media was added onto the
cells. The plates were incubated at 37°C CO2 incubator for 4 days. The overlay medium was
decanted and the cells were stained by 1% amido black. The plaque number was counted and
PRNT50 titers were calculated using a log probit regression analysis.

Histopathology
Lungs samples collected during necropsy were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The
tissues were processed using an automated tissue processor. The processed tissues were
embedded in paraffin and were sectioned using an automated microtome (Leica, Germany) and
were stained by hematoxylin and eosin staining.

10

Serum cytokine analysis
The serum cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF-α and IL-12) were assessed in
hamsters serum samples collected at 3, 7 and 14 DPI. A commercial ELISA (Immunotag, USA)
was used for the hamster specific cytokine quantitation. For this, plates precoated with hamster
specific cytokine antibody were used and a streptavidin based HRP system was used for

15

detection. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
Data analysis
For analysis of the data, Graph pad Prism version 8.4.3 software was used. For statistical
analysis; non parametric Mann Whitney tests were used and the p-values less than 0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant.
