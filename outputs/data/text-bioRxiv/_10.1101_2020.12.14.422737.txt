Summary: Many enveloped viruses induce multinucleated cells (syncytia), reflective of
membrane fusion events caused by the same machinery that underlies viral entry. These
syncytia are thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response. Here,
we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing
SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion,
producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the
mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cellcell fusion assay to screen ~6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with cell biological
and biophysical approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for membrane cholesterol in
spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our
findings provide a molecular basis for positive outcomes reported in COVID-19 patients taking
statins, and suggest new strategies for therapeutics targeting the membrane of SARS-CoV-2
and other fusogenic viruses.

Introduction
COVID-19 has caused over a million deaths in the year following identification of its causative
pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al., 2020a).
Building on knowledge of similar enveloped coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2012; Heald-Sargent and
Gallagher, 2012), recent studies made astonishing progress toward a holistic understanding of SARSCoV-2 pathobiology, suggesting amenable targets to therapeutic intervention (Haynes et al., 2020;
Stratton et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020). In particular, the unprecedented pace of SARS-CoV-2 research
led to key insights into viral fusion (V'kovski et al., 2020). Many early studies, including most small
molecule and genetic screens, focused on entry (Chen et al., 2020; Dittmar et al., 2020; Riva et al.,
2020; Wei et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b). Central to these efforts are trimeric spike glycoproteins (or
”peplomers”), which give the viral envelope its crown-like appearance, and ACE2, their essential
human receptor (Duan et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2020). Association of the two proteins underlies viruscell adhesion, which precedes a conformational change in spike that unleashes its fusion machinery to
infiltrate the cell (Hoffmann et al., 2020a; 2020b; Ke et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020;
Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020).
While essential protein-protein interactions for infectivity have been forthcoming, equally
important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology have received less attention. For example,
amplification of systemic infection requires mass production of functional virions, each of which relies
on a specific set of biomolecules to orchestrate the optimal number and spacing of spike trimers in its
envelope (Ke et al., 2020; Klein et al., 2020). How assembly occurs efficiently in the crowded cellular
environment is unclear. One favored hypothesis is that viral proteins are similarly trafficked to the ERGolgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). While cargo receptor-binding likely plays a role, an
alternative possibility is that such proteins feature an intrinsic preference for membrane domains of
distinct lipid composition (Cattin-Ortolá et al., 2020; Li et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2008a;
McBride et al., 2007; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004). Indeed, certain viruses require association between
receptor proteins and specific lipids to trigger endocytosis (Levental et al., 2020; Pelkmans, 2005).
Whether this is the case for ACE2 remains to be determined. Regardless, lipid bilayers’ differential
propensity to incorporate spike vs. ACE2 might determine whether premature interactions promote
unproductive membrane fusion in the cell interior, or if present at the cell surface, fusion of apposing
cells (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Cattin-Ortolá et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; McBride and Machamer,
2010a; Ou et al., 2020; Papa et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020).
For many enveloped viruses, infection indeed causes fusogenic viral protein display on the
host cell plasma membrane, which allows neighboring cells to fuse into multinucleated “syncytia”
(Ciechonska and Duncan, 2014; Compton and Schwartz, 2017; Duelli and Lazebnik, 2007). Past
studies of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and others suggest
that cell-cell fusion can play key roles in pathogenicity, whether it be in viral replication, or evasion of
the host immune response (Frankel et al., 1996; Johnson et al., 2007; Maudgal and Missotten, 1978).
Recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 identified similar syncytia (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Cattin-Ortolá et al.,
2020; Ou et al., 2020; Papa et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020), which may or may not be relevant to patient
pathology (Bryce et al., 2020; Giacca et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). It remains an
open question if syncytia are related to viral and host cell membrane composition, and whether their
formation provides mechanistic insights into membrane-targeting therapeutics directed toward
enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (Daniels et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
Here, we address these significant gaps in our understanding of COVID-19 pathobiology by
employing a suite of microscopy-based approaches built around the finding that co-cultures of ACE2and spike-expressing cells amass widespread syncytia. Mechanistically, ACE2-spike clusters
assemble at transcellular, synapse-like contacts, which precede fusion pore formation and
multinucleation. A high-throughput screen for modulators of cell-cell fusion, involving ~6000
compounds and >30 spike variants, collectively underscore an essential role for cholesterol-spike
association in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that modulation of membrane composition

may inhibit viral propagation, and further informs critical lipid-protein assemblies in physiological
syncytia and cell adhesion.
Results
Syncytia derive from fusion events at synapse-like, spike-ACE2 protein clusters
Given the central role of the ACE2-spike interaction in viral infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Li
et al., 2003; Mittal et al., 2020), we sought to develop a live cell microscopy assay of binding and
membrane fusion. We generated human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, chosen for their flat morphology,
stably expressing fluorescently tagged ACE2 or spike (full-length, “FL” vs. receptor-binding domain,
“RBD”; see Figure 1A for domain organization), using the B7 transmembrane (“TM”) domain (Liao et
al., 2001; Lin et al., 2013) as a control. Upon co-culture, ACE2 and spike RBD cluster at cell-cell
interfaces in a binding-dependent manner (Figure 1B). By contrast, and in agreement with others
(Buchrieser et al., 2020; Cattin-Ortolá et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020), spike FL/ACE2
interactions drove membrane fusion, with the vast majority of cells joining multinucleated syncytia after
a day of co-culture (Figure 1C).
We reasoned that if this co-culture system recapitulates established findings regarding
spike/ACE2-mediated viral entry, it might serve as a useful high-throughput proxy assay for infection,
without need for enhanced biosafety protocols. To examine this possibility, we first confirmed that
fusion events occur following co-culture of spike cells with infection-competent cell lines (VeroE6,
Calu3) in absence of ACE2 overexpression, but not with those that do not support infection (Beas2B,
U2OS without ACE2) (Figure S1A) (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). We further validated the relevance of the
assay by showing that domains required for virus-cell entry (e.g. binding domain, RBD; fusion
machinery, heptad repeats and fusion peptide) are needed for cell-cell fusion (Figure S1B). Similar to
results obtained with infectious virus (Hoffmann et al., 2020a), fusion required the spike S2’ cleavage
site but not the S1/S2 site (Figure S1C). Finally, different fluorescent tags (GFP, mCherry, iRFP) gave
similar results (Figure S1D,E), expanding the fluorescent toolkit for live cell studies.
We hypothesized that spike/ACE2-mediated syncytia form in a stepwise manner, which might
illuminate mechanisms of formation and pathogenesis. We performed live cell microscopy of cocultures, documenting dozens of fusion events preceding large syncytia. Invariably, contact between
opposite cell types (spike vs. ACE2) results in near instantaneous accumulation of spike protein
clusters at ACE2-containing membrane protrusions (Figure 1D-E). These punctate structures are
long-lived (minutes) (Video S1), similar to physiological synapses (e.g. neuronal, immunological)
(Cohen and Ziv, 2019; Dustin, 2014). In all observed cases, fusion events proceed from such
synapses (Figure 1E-F; Video S2), often within a few minutes of their formation, but frequently
following longer durations of time. In most (but not all) examples, fusion pore dilation follows retraction
of an individual spike cluster toward the interior of an ACE2 cell (Figure 1F-I), suggesting that motilityassociated mechanical forces (e.g. actomyosin contractility) and/or endocytosis is pivotal to
overcoming the energetic barrier to lipid bilayer mixing. When cells are plated at high density, most
“primary” fusion events occur within 60 minutes (Figure 1G-J), with latter “secondary” amalgamation
of small syncytia into progressively larger structures (Figure 1K; Video S3). Over time, syncytia
undergo vacuolization, likely from fusion-driven collapse of intracellular organelles into hybrid
compartments (Figure 1L). By 48-72 hours, cells disintegrate into immobile spike/ACE2-coated
vesicles, having eaten themselves from within (Figure 1M).
Syncytia are a defining pathological feature of COVID-19
While clearly useful for interrogating spike domains that modulate membrane fusion, a critical
gap in our knowledge concerns the pathophysiological relevance of the syncytia themselves. Given
the cytotoxic consequences of cell fusion (Figure 1M), an appealing hypothesis is that ACE2/spikemediated cell vacuolization contributes in part to the diffuse alveolar damage observed in the lungs of

COVID-19 patients (Menter et al., 2020). Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 spike is a particularly potent
mediator of syncytia formation relative to both SARS-CoV-1 spike and commonly studied fusogens
(e.g. p14 FAST, MYMK/MYMX) (Bi et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2020b) based on side-by-side
comparisons (Figure 2A-C).
We speculated that this superior ability to promote cell-cell fusion might be reflected by unique
pathological attributes in vivo. If so, we predicted that syncytia would be readily detected in the lungs
of COVID-19 patients. To test this, we histologically evaluated lung samples from 24 deceased
patients (“decedents”) with diffuse alveolar damage secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection; 6 decedents
who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 but did not have pulmonary manifestations (died of other causes);
and 9 control decedents with diffuse alveolar damage (died prior to SARS-CoV-2 discovery in 2019).
Multinucleated syncytia were detected in 18 of 24 decedents who died as a direct consequence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2D-H), a finding supported by other patient cohorts (Giacca et al.,
2020; Tian et al., 2020). These syncytia were of lung epithelial origin, as demonstrated by nuclear
staining for TTF-1 (NKX2-1) (Figure 2F). In contrast, only 1 of the 9 decedents with diffuse alveolar
damage from other causes demonstrated multinucleated syncytia, indicating that these syncytia are
not a common feature of lung inflammation (Figure 2G,H). They were also absent in lung tissue from
the 6 SARS-CoV-2 decedents who did not show pulmonary manifestations and died of other causes.
Thus, pathological syncytia are a direct consequence of pulmonary involvement by SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 2H). These syncytia, however, were generally not positive for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein, similar to previous reports (Bryce et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020). Thus, we cannot rule out a
yet-to-be identified pulmonary abnormality specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection (but spike-independent),
or related to free spike proteins in the alveolar debris, in pathological syncytia formation.
A novel high-throughput screening platform identifies modulators of syncytia formation
Given the potential pathological relevance of syncytia and their ability to interrogate SARS-CoV2 entry, we sought to adapt our cell model into a high-throughput assay to uncover molecular
mechanisms and drug targets. We developed and evaluated three different fixed-cell microscopy
assays, each of which used fluorescent proteins as readouts for fusion (Figure S2B,D), with total
nuclei number serving as a toxicity measure. Two of these assays (human U2OS-ACE2 vs. monkey
VeroE6 heterokaryon) leveraged RNA-binding proteins’ ability to shuttle between the nucleus and
cytosol (Iijima et al., 2006; Zinszner et al., 1997), with nuclear co-localization of mCherry/GFP
reflecting cell fusion. The third assay used split-GFP (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2017), which
only fluoresces when its two halves come into contact (e.g. after fusion). After careful assessment, the
U2OS-ACE2 heterokaryon system was shown to be the superior assay based on its Z’-factor (0.85), a
measure of separation between positive (spike RBD/ACE2 co-culture, no fusion) and negative (spike
FL/ACE2 co-culture) controls (Figures 3A, S2D); generally Z’-factor > 0.5 is considered excellent for a
high-throughput assay (Zhang et al., 1999). To determine an optimal time point for quantification, cocultures were performed for 1-6 hours: fusion was detectable by 1-hour, and Z’-factor peaked by 4-5
hours (Figure S2B).
Armed with a tractable assay (Figure 3A,B), we sought to characterize essential pathways for
fusion, employing dose-response studies of a panel of drugs with well-characterized mechanism of
action. Given that protease-mediated S2’ cleavage is essential for cell-cell fusion (Figure S1C), we
anticipated a large effect for specific classes of protease inhibitors. We thus tested a panel of spike
protease inhibitors (n=10), which included antagonists of both established SARS-CoV-2 entry
pathways (cathepsin-mediated endocytic vs. TMPRSS2/furin-dependent direct fusion) (Hoffmann et
al., 2020a; 2020b; 2020c; Kawase et al., 2012; Millet and Whittaker, 2014; Ou et al., 2020; Shirato et
al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2015). Surprisingly, the antiretroviral protease inhibitor nelfinavir was unique in
blocking fusion (Figure 3C). Given that other serine protease inhibitors (AEBSF, leupeptin, camostat)
lacked efficacy, inhibition by nelfinavir may be related to its proteolysis-independent targets (Brüning et
al., 2013; De Gassart et al., 2016; Kirby et al., 2011).

Next, we screened drugs that target specific routes of endocytosis or steps in the secretory
pathway. Notably, no single endocytic route (clathrin, caveolae, macropinocytosis) was essential
(Figures 3D; S2E,F), and markers of each pathway did not co-localize with spike at sites of
membrane-fusion or in the vesicles that resulted (Figure S2A). Nevertheless, certain drugs prevented
syncytia formation (Figure 3E,F). For example, apilimod, a promising COVID-19 drug candidate that
inhibits PIKFYVE kinase (Cai et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2020; Riva et al., 2020), was particularly potent
(Figure 3E). Inhibition of actin polymerization blocked fusion (Figure 3E), consistent with a putative
role for cortical actomyosin-generated mechanical forces in fusion pore formation (Figure 1) (Chan et
al., 2020b; Shilagardi et al., 2013). Finally, several drugs that perturb membrane lipid composition
were identified (MBCD/lovastatin, genistein, nystatin) (Figure 3E). These compounds could
conceivably act by permeabilizing the plasma membrane. To rule out this possibility, cell fusion was
examined following treatment with membrane permeabilizers digitonin or ethanol, both of which had
no effect on fusion at non-toxic concentrations (Figure S2C). Finally, most compounds acted similarly
in the VeroE6 heterokaryon assay (Figures 3F; S3), which expresses endogenous ACE2. We
therefore conclude that our syncytium-based screening platform can identify fusion-inhibiting drugs
that act independently of canonical entry pathways and might uncover yet-to-be described
determinants of membrane fusion.
A drug repurposing screen implicates membrane lipid composition in cell-cell fusion
To gain further mechanistic insight into cell-cell fusion, we performed a drug repurposing
screen of ~6000 small molecules at 30 µM (Figure 4A). Of these, 167 (2.8%) were inhibitory “hits”,
which signified non-toxic compounds with a decrease in fusion greater than 3-standard deviations from
the mean (z-score<-3) (Figure 4B; Table S1). To validate, we performed 7-point dose-responses for
the top-80 most potent compounds, the vast majority of which replicated (Figures 4C; S4A,B).
Compounds were then unblinded to select experimenters. Reassuringly, 23 of these hits were
redundant across the combined libraries (Figure S4B), and several were identified in previous virus
entry screens (Caly et al., 2020; Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2020c; Kindrachuk et
al., 2015; Riva et al., 2020; Yamamoto et al., 2016). We eliminated batch-dependent effects,
purchasing top compounds from independent vendors, and replicating dose-response measurements
for 23 of 24 (Figure S4A). To assess cell type specificity, dose-response studies for the same
molecules were performed in the VeroE6 heterokaryon assay (Figure S4A). In almost all cases,
inhibition of fusion occurred at lower compound concentrations relative to the U2OS assay, possibly
due to differences in ACE2 levels between cell lines.
Given their unusually high EC50 (>10 µM) (Figure S4A), identified small molecules might act
directly on the lipid bilayer (Tsuchiya, 2015), possibly by virtue of shared physicochemical or structural
features. To assess this, we compared 20 physicochemical parameters (ChemAxon) for non-hits vs.
hits, using GPCR inhibitors (~35% of FDA-approved drugs) (Sriram and Insel, 2018) as a control
library (Figures 4D; S5A,B). Among several statistically significant differences, hits were more
lipophilic (LogD) and featured a greater number of ring systems (Figure 4D). Reassuringly, little
correlation was observed between EC50 values and lipophilicity (Figure 4E), indicating that the trend is
not a result of a general increase in lipophilicity with avidity, as is commonly observed for promiscuous
compounds in phenotypic screens (Tarcsay and Keserű, 2013).
Next, we asked whether specific chemical scaffolds are over-represented in hit compounds
relative to ineffective compounds (Figures 4F; S5C). Two scaffold classes (and corresponding
substructures) reached particularly high statistical enrichment: dicholorophenethyl-imidazoles (found in
azole antifungals) and tetrahydropyran-containing macrocyclic lactones (found in both ivermectin- and
rapamycin-like compounds) (Figures 4C,F; S5C). Such molecules can directly interact with the
plasma membrane (François et al., 2009), perturbing cholesterol (e.g. production, transport) (Bauer et
al., 2018; Mast et al., 2013; Trinh et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2010), and have been implicated as promising
repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment, albeit by different mechanism of action (Caly et al., 2020;
Gordon et al., 2020; Kindrachuk et al., 2015; Rajter et al., 2020).

Highly unusual membrane-proximal regions of spike are needed for fusion
Based on the prevalence of lipophilic hits from the small-molecule screen, we posited that
membrane-proximal regions of spike and/or ACE2 associate with essential plasma membrane lipids
(e.g. cholesterol) to facilitate cell-cell fusion. To test this, we replaced the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains of both ACE2 and spike with the previously used B7 TM (Figure 1B, Table S4).
While “chimeric” ACE2 similarly promoted cell fusion relative to wild-type (WT), chimeric spike protein
lost this ability (Figure 5A). To determine critical elements that differentiate WT and chimeric spike
from one another, we mutated its transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains (Figure 5B),
assessing fusion in co-culture models (Figures 1A, 3A). Replacement of spike’s transmembrane
domain with single-pass TMs of unrelated proteins (B7, ITGA1) blocked fusion, despite similar
subcellular localization and ACE2-binding (Figures 5C,L; S6A-C). Inclusion of a small extracellular
motif of B7 not only eliminated fusion, but also impaired the ability of the chimeric spike to form
synapse-like clusters with ACE2 (Figure 5A). This is likely indicative of an essential role of spike’s
membrane-proximal aromatic residues in cholesterol engagement (Hu et al., 2019a), as suggested by
work on related coronaviruses (Corver et al., 2009; de Jesus and Allen, 2013; Epand et al., 2003; Liao
et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2008b; Meher et al., 2019).
In parallel, we serially truncated the spike cytoplasmic domain (CTD). Removal of its COPIIbinding, ER-Golgi retrieval motif (Cattin-Ortolá et al., 2020; McBride et al., 2007) (1-1268) had no
effect, nor did deletion of its subsequent acidic patch (1-1256) (Figures 5C,L; S6A-C). However,
removal of an additional 11 amino acids (1-1245) decreased fusion, and further truncation (1-1239)
completely blocked it (Figures 5C,L; S6A-C). Relative fusion correlated with overall cysteine content
of the CTD (Figure 5C). These findings are consistent with previous studies on similar coronaviruses,
which suggested that membrane-proximal cysteines are post-translationally modified with
palmitoylated lipid moieties (McBride and Machamer, 2010a; Petit et al., 2007; Sobocińska et al.,
2017).
Palmitoylated proteins typically feature only a few cysteines available for modification (Chlanda
et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2007). We wondered whether spike CTD’s peculiarly high cysteine content
was unique amongst viral proteins, and performed a bioinformatic analysis of all viral transmembrane
proteins, ranking them on maximal cysteine content in 20 amino-acid sliding windows (Figure 5D-G).
Of all proteins in viruses that infect humans, SARS-CoV-2 spike features the highest cysteine content,
followed closely by spike proteins in related coronaviruses, then hepatitis E ORF3 (Figure 5G; Table
S2); it should be noted that ORF3 is palmitoylated and critical to viral egress (Ding et al., 2017;
Gouttenoire et al., 2018). Consistent with studies on similar coronavirus spike proteins (Liao et al.,
2006; McBride and Machamer, 2010a; Petit et al., 2007), mutagenesis of all spike cysteines to alanine
severely diminishes cell-cell fusion in both U2OS and Vero models (Figures 5I-L; S6B-C). To examine
the role of cysteine palmitoylation, we assessed fusion upon treatment with palmitoylation inhibitor, 2bromopalmitate (2-BP) (Martin, 2013). The effect was modest in U2OS cells, but clear in Vero cells,
suggesting that cysteine palmitoylation is indeed likely central (Figure 5K). Thus, both cysteine
palmitoylation and unique characteristics of its aromatic-rich transmembrane domain known to
associate with cholesterol are essential for spike’s role in membrane fusion.
Given the synapse-like structures observed in living cells (Figure 1), we asked whether SARSCoV-2 spike features amino acid motifs similar to human proteins that drive similar assemblies. Of the
thousands of human transmembrane proteins, only 15 were “spike-like”, featuring both high
membrane-proximal cysteine and aromatic content (Figure 5H; Table S3). Remarkably, the top four
are all critical to forming specific types of adhesion junctions: three to tricellular tight junctions (ILDR1,
ILDR2, LSR) and one to kidney/intestine tight junctions (IGSF5) (Figure S6D) (Higashi et al., 2013;
Hirabayashi et al., 2003). In light of the important role for palmitoylation in tricellular tight junction
assembly (Oda et al., 2020), these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 operates by a similar
mechanism to promote adhesion and transcellular interfaces.

Spike requires membrane cholesterol for fusion but via a raft-independent mechanism
Together, these data suggest that membrane fusion requires spike association with specific
elements of the plasma membrane. If so, such assemblies would display slow dynamics relative to
transmembrane proteins that more freely diffuse in the two-dimensional lipid bilayer. To test this idea,
we utilized fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to determine the recovery rate of a
fluorescent molecule in a bleached region, and thereby infer relative apparent molecular diffusion
coefficients (Soumpasis, 1983). FRAP experiments were performed on a series of GFP-tagged spike
variants and controls (B7 TM and ACE2) to determine whether its transmembrane domain and/or
cysteine-rich CTD influence diffusion. Recovery for GFP-tagged ACE2, B7 TM-anchored RBD, and the
B7 transmembrane control were similar (Figure 6C), approximating diffusion times for commonly
studied transmembrane proteins (Day et al., 2012). In contrast, RBD attached to the native TM/CTD of
spike featured significantly reduced recovery, with FL spike displaying even slower dynamics (Figure
6A-C). Swapping the B7 TM for spike TM/CTD rescued the rapid recovery, whereas exchange of just
the TM or removal of cysteine-containing regions had an intermediate effect (Figure 6C). Conversely,
deletion of regions shown to bind specific intracellular proteins (e.g. COPII-binding ER-Golgi retrieval
motif, 1268-1273) had no effect (Figure 6C), implicating lipid-protein and not protein-protein
interactions in spike’s dynamics.
Given that membrane-proximal regions (Table S4) of spike regulate diffusivity and fusogen
behavior, an intriguing possibility is that such features conspire to facilitate engagement of cholesterolrich membrane domains (or “lipid rafts”) (Levental et al., 2020; Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003; Simons
and Ikonen, 1997). Our findings on the requirement for spike’s cysteine residues in fusion is interesting
in this context, since palmitoylation of other proteins can drive association with these 10-50 nm
protein-lipid clusters in the plasma membrane (Levental et al., 2010). While challenging to study in
living cells, lipid rafts can be readily interrogated using ex vivo, phase separation assays as a micronscale proxy for cholesterol association at the nano-scale (Levental and Levental, 2015; Veatch, 2007;
Veatch and Keller, 2003). A particularly powerful example employs chemical-induced giant plasma
membrane vesicles (GPMVs) from cells expressing a protein of interest (e.g. spike-GFP), allowing
membrane components to reach equilibrium at reduced temperature (Baumgart et al., 2007; Holowka
and Baird, 1983; Levental et al., 2009; Sengupta et al., 2008; Veatch et al., 2008). Given previous
results using indirect detergent fractionation readouts (McBride and Machamer, 2010b; Petit et al.,
2007), we were surprised to observe that SARS-CoV-2 spike does not partition strongly into GPMVs’
dense, ordered phase (Lo) (Figure 6D), which is enriched for cholesterol and sphingolipids (Levental
et al., 2009; 2011). Moreover, in our cell fusion assay, treatment with the raft-disrupting drug myriocin,
which depletes sphingolipids from the plasma membrane (Castello-Serrano et al., 2020), did not inhibit
fusion (Figure 6F,G). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein appears to facilitate membrane-fusion in a
manner that is dependent on palmitoylation of its uniquely cysteine-rich CTD, but through a
mechanism unique from canonical membrane nanodomains, although we cannot rule out a
discrepancy in lipid raft properties between GPMVs and living cells (Levental et al., 2020).
Despite lack of partitioning into the cholesterol-rich ordered phase of GPMVs, we noted that
long-term culture caused spike (but not ACE2) to accumulate in immobile deposits on the glass
surface of the culture dish (Figures 6E; S7B). Recent studies determined that cholesterol-rich
membrane components are particularly prone to sloughing from the cell and sticking to glass surfaces
(He et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019b). We thus co-expressed the cholesterol-binding protein SCARB1
(Linton et al., 2017) with spike or stained spike cells with fluorescently labeled cholesterol. Both
cholesterol markers co-localized with immobilized spike deposits (Figures 6E; S7A-C). Taken
together, the data suggests that spike directly associates with a population of cholesterol (Das et al.,
2014; Kinnebrew et al., 2019), which is biochemically distinct from the sphingomyelin-associated lipid
complexes enriched in canonical rafts.
To interrogate the role of cholesterol in cell fusion, we tested drugs that disrupt cholesterol
synthesis (zaragozic acid) or reduce plasma membrane cholesterol (25-hydroxycholesterol; methylbeta-cyclodextrin or “MBCD”) in the U2OS-ACE2 heterokaryon assay. All compounds inhibited fusion

in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6H). However, such drugs can indirectly lead to cholesterolindependent changes in membrane lipid composition, especially at high concentrations (Zidovetzki
and Levitan, 2007). To more directly study the role of cholesterol levels, we harnessed MBCD’s ability
to shuttle specific lipids into the plasma membrane (Zidovetzki and Levitan, 2007). Unlike MBCDconjugated linoleic acid and oleic acid, cholesterol greatly enhanced fusion (Figures 6I; S7D,E).
We surmised that the drug repurposing screen identified compounds that act similarly, thus
implicating a counteracting plasma membrane property that increases fusion. Indeed, a small subset
of compounds, which include allylamine antifungals (naftifine and terbinafine) and anesthetics
(ropivacaine, bupivacaine, propofol), enhance fusion in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 6J; S7F).
Whether this is related to an opposing effect on lipid bilayer composition and dynamics relative to
cholesterol-depleting drugs requires further inquiry, but is intriguing in light of extensive literature on
anesthetics and membrane mobility (Cornell et al., 2017; Goldstein, 1984; Gray et al., 2013; Tsuchiya
and Mizogami, 2013).
SARS2-CoV-2 infection depends on membrane cholesterol of the virus but not the host cell
Our findings on ACE2/spike-mediated fusion, using both U2OS and VeroE6 cells, suggest that
many effective compounds prevent fusion by depleting cholesterol from the plasma membrane
(Figure 6). While the relevance of such drugs for syncytium formation and disease pathogenesis in
vivo remains circumstantial (Figure 2), the data nonetheless has implications for virus assembly and
entry. Specifically, we predict that such compounds would lack efficacy in virus entry models (Chen et
al., 2020; Dittmar et al., 2020; Riva et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b), instead requiring
perturbation of the spike-containing virus membrane derived from the donor cell. To test this, we
quantified spike-pseudotyped MLV particle entry into ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing A549 acceptor cells
(Figure 7A), which are primarily infected via the direct fusion pathway (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Shirato
et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020b). Apilimod, a PIKFYVE inhibitor and promising therapeutic in multiple
SARS-CoV-2 models (Kang et al., 2020; Riva et al., 2020) including heterokaryon assays tested
herein (Figures 3E; S3B), prevented pseudoparticle entry at nanomolar concentrations (Figure 7B).
By contrast, 25-hydroxycholesterol, which lowers plasma membrane cholesterol by redirection to the
cell interior (Abrams et al., 2020; Im et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,
2020b; Zu et al., 2020), had no effect (Figure 7C). However, MBCD, which directly “strips” plasma
membrane cholesterol without engaging intracellular targets (Zidovetzki and Levitan, 2007), blocked
virus entry (Figure 7D).
Given the relative potency of MBCD in the pseudovirus entry model vs. syncytia assays
(Figures 6H; 7D), we hypothesized that it acts by depleting cholesterol from the viral membrane and
not the host cell. To discriminate these possibilities, we used the same ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing
A549 cell line, but with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure 7E). Addition of virus in absence
of drug resulted in significant infection of the cell layer, with many cells appearing as multi-nucleated
following infection (Figure 7F). Pre-treatment of cells with millimolar doses of MBCD, which strongly
inhibits both co-culture syncytia formation and pseudovirus entry, had no effect on infection as
determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (Figure 7F,G). In striking contrast, pre-treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 with low micromolar MBCD completely blocked infection (Figure 7F,G). Therefore,
cholesterol content of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, but not the host cell, is critical to infectivity (Figure
7H).
Discussion
Unprecedented resources devoted to the COVID-19 pandemic have allowed identification of
promising stopgap therapeutic measures, as reaching effective vaccination coverage among
populations will take time. Virus entry-based assays were particularly critical to discovering essential
receptors (ACE2) and proteases for SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with promising repurposed drugs

(Dittmar et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020a; 2020b; Lan et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Riva et al.,
2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Zhu
et al., 2020b). However, many fundamental aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle remain poorly
understood, hampering efforts for effective treatment. In particular, commonly used approaches are
poorly equipped to interrogate factors that contribute to the formation of a fusion-competent virus,
particularly in a high-throughput manner amenable to both small molecule and genetic screens. Here,
we show that in vitro SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 cell co-culture assays overcome this limitation,
and uncover a critical role for viral membrane composition in infection and formation of pathological
syncytia.
Our approach relies on a combination of high throughput screening, quantitative live cell
imaging, and viral infection assays, all of which implicate cholesterol-rich regions of the plasma
membrane in spike-mediated membrane fusion. Cholesterol is known to preferentially interact with
certain membrane proteins, particularly those modified with specific lipid moieties (e.g. palmitic acid)
(Levental et al., 2010; Martin, 2013; Sobocińska et al., 2017), together clustering into nanodomains
which have been referred to as lipid rafts (Levental et al., 2020; Simons and Ikonen, 1997; Veatch and
Keller, 2005). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 spike, such cholesterol-rich nanodomains could
potentially facilitate the energetically-unfavorable process of lipid bilayer mixing (Heald-Sargent and
Gallagher, 2012; Kim and Chen, 2019; Tenchov et al., 2006). However, given its lack of partitioning
into ordered GPMV domains (Figure 6D), spike may form nanoscale clusters by a different
mechanism. A favored model is that an accessible population of cholesterol, independent of
sphingolipids and rafts (Das et al., 2014; Kinnebrew et al., 2019), interacts directly with spike trimers
and mediates formation of higher-order protein-lipid assemblies (Figure 7H). Precedent for this model
is provided by raft-independent yet cholesterol-dependent mechanisms of biomolecular clustering
essential for influenza infection (Goronzy et al., 2018; Zawada et al., 2016). Spike’s cysteine-rich CTD
could further amplify this effect, by directly promoting dynamic protein oligomers, similar to what was
recently described for the orthoreovirus p14 FAST protein (Chan et al., 2020a). The interplay between
oligomerization, palmitoylation, cholesterol association, and membrane dynamics will require further
inquiry beyond the scope of this study.
In strong support for a key role of lipid structure and composition in spike-mediated membrane
fusion, many compound classes over-represented in our drug repurposing screen are implicated in
perturbation of the lipid bilayer (e.g. antifungal azoles, rapalog/mTOR inhibitors, ivermectin analogs)
(Figure 4C-F) (Bauer et al., 2018; Head et al., 2017; Long et al., 2020; Mast et al., 2013; Trinh et al.,
2017; Xu et al., 2010). Interestingly, anti-fungals appear to be enriched in both fusion-inhibiting and promoting hits. However, the latter tended to favor allylamines rather than azoles, implicating
physicochemical and structural differences in direction of effect despite similar action on fungal
ergosterol synthesis. We further note that our screen identified anesthetics as promoters of fusion
(Figures 4B; 6J). This is intriguing, given that anesthetics are chemically diverse, hydrophobic
molecules, which perturb lipid mobility and ordering in membranes (Cornell et al., 2017; Goldstein,
1984; Gray et al., 2013; Tsuchiya and Mizogami, 2013). Whether such similarities can be extended to
other fusion-promoting compounds remains to be determined, as is the root membrane-based
property that discriminates them from drugs that prevent syncytia formation.
Our high-throughput screening approach uses transcellular membrane fusion as a proxy for
virus entry into the host cell. However, beyond a screening tool, we present findings that suggest
direct pathological relevance for syncytia. Specifically, human cell populations expressing ACE2 or
spike cause cellular pathology with unexpected parallels to COVID-19 patient histology, who feature
pervasive multinucleated cells in lung tissue (Figure 2) (Giacca et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). These
COVID-19 patient syncytia are similar to those found in other respiratory viral infections (Frankel et al.,
1996; Johnson et al., 2007; Maudgal and Missotten, 1978). Whether COVID-19 syncytia arise by the
cellular pathways described in this work is unclear, although recent data is supportive. For example,
contemporary studies report syncytia in cultured cells following exposure to infectious SARS-CoV-2
(Buchrieser et al., 2020; Cattin-Ortolá et al., 2020; Papa et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020), an observation

that we extend to ACE2/TMPRSS2 A549 cells (Figure 7F). Further, the synapses that precede fusion
(Figure 1) superficially resemble the virus-filled filopodia observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Bouhaddou et al., 2020). We hypothesize that such structures arise via intercellular interactions
between ACE2 and virus-unincorporated spike clusters, but cannot rule out the proposed kinasebased mechanism (Bouhaddou et al., 2020).
Whether or not syncytia play a major role in COVID-19 disease progression, the fact that lipidtargeting drugs disrupt spike-mediated membrane fusion has implications for treatment. Indeed,
cholesterol-tuned viral infectivity was similarly shown using both spike-pseudotyped MLV and patient
isolates of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide strong evidence that viral spike-cholesterol association,
and not lipid composition of the host cell membrane or resultant endocytic pathway, mediates effects
reported in this study (Figure 7) and perhaps others (Zhu et al., 2020b). Ultimately, viral membranes
are produced from the membranes of infected host cells, suggesting that lipid-targeting treatments
might disrupt formation of fusion-competent virus particles. Given the advanced state of hyperlipidemia
drug development (e.g. statins) (Goldstein and Brown, 2015), insights from this work may be of
immediate significance for COVID-19 treatment. Consistent with this, retrospective analyses of patient
outcomes observed significant reductions in mortality for those prescribed cholesterol-lowering statins
(Daniels et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). A critical role for cholesterol in virus assembly may explain
this observation, and could partially account for why COVID-19 risk factors (e.g. menopause, obesity,
age) (Costeira et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) similarly correlate with differential sterol processing.
Additional work is clearly required, but in the context of the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19
treatment options, our findings underscore the potential utility of statins and other lipid modifying
treatments.
Invariably, opportunistic infections hijack physiological cellular processes to ensure their survival
(Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003). To this end, we speculate that physiological and pathological
synapses and resulting syncytia (or lack there of) arise in part from shared lipid bilayer properties at
the nanoscale. Consistent with this concept, actin-dependent, ACE2/spike fusion events proceed from
“finger-like” projections and synapses between cells to fusion pore dilation and membrane collapse,
closely resembling the orderly biogenesis of myoblast-derived syncytia (Chen et al., 2008; Duan et al.,
2018; Kim and Chen, 2019; Shi et al., 2017; Shilagardi et al., 2013). Second, we highlight the
remarkable similarities between SARS-CoV-2 spike and tricellular tight junction proteins (Higashi et
al., 2013; Oda et al., 2020; Sohet et al., 2015), specifically with respect to membrane-anchoring
cysteines and aromatics (Figures 5H; S6D,E). These observations suggest that both pathological
viruses and adherent cells independently evolved proteins with abnormally strong affinity for the
plasma membrane to ensure stability of transcellular complexes (Figure 7H), whether to initiate fusion
or maintain tissue integrity. We thus envision that assays presented herein may have broad utility for
understanding the biophysics of synapse and fusion pore assembly, representing an exciting example
of how inquiry into viral pathogenesis illuminates physiological function.

column), negative control (DMSO, blue column), test compounds (other columns). After 5-hours,
cells are fixed and nuclei are stained (Hoechst) then identified/segmented by automated confocal
microscopy. Fraction cells fused is determined by percent co-positive (mCherry and EYFP) nuclei.
Sample images and schematic interpretation of a positive control well (top), test well with reduced
fusion (middle), negative control well (bottom). Z’-factor measures window size with higher score
indicating a more robust screening platform.

Figure 4. A drug repurposing screen implicates membrane lipid composition in cell-cell fusion
(A) High-throughput pipeline and workflow of small molecule screen (~6000 compounds, 30 µM) in
ACE2-U2OS heterokaryon assay. “Hits” refer to non-toxic compounds with a decrease in fusion of
>3 standard deviations relative to plate negative control. 7-point dose-response was determined
for top-80 inhibitors, followed by validation of select compounds (n=24; obtained from different
vendors) in both ACE2-U2OS and VeroE6 heterokaryon assays.
(B) Results of compound screen. Plot: fraction fused vs. toxicity z-score. Red dots indicate
compounds with decreased fusion (z-score<-3); blue inset, potential hits following toxicity filtering
(z-score<3); blue circles, quality-controlled hits (inhibitory, non-toxic compounds with normal
fluorescence); gray inset, compounds with increase in fraction cells fused (z-score>5) but no
toxicity (“enhancers”, see Figure 6J); right histogram, compound density as function of fraction
fused z-score. Chemical structures are displayed for select validated hits. See Table S1 for raw
data.
(C) Dose-responses for select hits in enriched substructure classes (see Figure 4F): imidazoles (e.g.
azole antifungals, green) and macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin-like, yellow; rapalogs, pink). Mean
and SEM: n=3 biological replicates (16 images per).
(D) Box-and-whisker plots of select physicochemical properties (lipophilicity, logD; ring systems) for
non-hits (blue), inhibitory hits (red), and GPCR inhibitors (purple) as calculated in ChemAxon.
Boxes encompass 25-75% of variance; whiskers, 10-90%. Mean values are indicated by “+”;
median values, lines. Statistical significance was assessed by Mann-Whitney U test: P-values of
<0.05 and <0.001 are represented by * and **, respectively.
(E) Lack of correlation between inhibitory hit EC50 (see Figure S4A) and lipophilicity according to
linear regression analysis conducted in GraphPad Prism.
(F) Three substructure classes based on two scaffolds were identified to have high statistical
enrichment in hits over non-hits: dicholorophenethyl-imidazoles (found in azole antifungals, green)
and tetrahydropyrans with alkyl moieties (found in macrocyclic lactones; yellow and pink indicate
ivemectin-like and rapalog compounds, respectively).

Figure 5. Highly unusual membrane-proximal regions of spike are needed for fusion.
(A) Representative images of co-cultured (24-hours) U2OS cell lines, stably expressing indicated
fluorescently tagged ACE2 or spike. “B7 TM” indicates swap of endogenous transmembrane (TM)
and cytoplasmic domain (CTD) of spike or ACE2 with that of the monomeric, single-pass, B7
transmembrane protein, along with its membrane-proximal extracellular region (30-amino acid
spacer). White asterisks indicate nuclei in syncytia; red, in isolation. Note lack of arrowheads
(synapses) in middle condition. See Table S4 for residue composition of such “chimeric” proteins.
(B) Graphical representation of SARS-CoV-2 spike’s TM alpha-helix and membrane-proximal regions,
with residues colored by chemical properties (yellow, aromatic; cysteine, magenta; hydrophobic,
gray; non-charged hydrophilic, green; charged hydrophilic; blue; proline, red). Of note: aromaticrich region at ectodomain-TM interface, cysteine-rich cytoplasmic domain (CTD).
(C) ACE2-U2OS heterokaryon assay but with co-cultured HNRNPA1-EYFP cells expressing spike
variants (indicated). Relative CTD cysteine content for variants is depicted with heat map (top;
dark red = more cysteines, white = none). Mean and SEM: n=4 biological replicates (16 images
per). See Figure S6B for all tested spike variants in both ACE2-U2OS and VeroE6 heterokaryon
assays; Figure S6C, for representative images of ACE2-mCherry U2OS cells co-cultured with

summary of total set of viral proteins retrieved and analyzed for the human virus proteome (left)
and human proteome (right); green slice references proportion of proteins with one or more
predicted transmembrane helixes.
(F) Conservation of cysteine-rich CTD between spike proteins of highly pathogenic human
coronaviruses. The only difference between the CTD of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is
acquisition of an additional cysteine in the latter. MERS is substantially different, yet retains
enrichment of cysteines.
(G) Histogram of fractional cysteine scores for viral proteins, with high-fraction hits explicitly annotated.
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has the highest local cysteine density of any viral protein, closely
followed by spike proteins from other coronaviruses.

Red: “spike-like” transmembrane proteins with high cytoplasmic cysteine content and aromatic
residues at ectodomain-membrane interface.

10).
(J) Representative images for 24-hour co-culture of ACE2-mCherry (magenta) U2OS cells with those
expressing GFP-tagged spike variant (green). White asterisks indicate nuclei in syncytia; red,
those in isolation; arrowhead, synapses (select examples noted).

host cell.
(A) Schematic representation of pseudotyped virus entry assay in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing A549
acceptor cells, which are primarily infected via direct fusion pathway. Pseudovirus encodes
Gaussia luciferase gene, which allows luminescence-based measure of relative entry as a function
of compound concentration.
(B) Dose-dependent inhibition of pseudovirus entry (luminescence, arbitrary units) for a positive
control compound (apilimod, PIKFYVE inhibitor), relative to control (1 = no effect; 0 = complete
block). Mean and SEM indicated for six replicates.
(C) Similar to Figure 7B, but for cholesterol-transport disrupting drug, 25-hydroxycholesterol.
(D) Similar to Figure 7B, but for plasma membrane cholesterol-stripping compound, MBCD.
(E) Schematic of SARS-CoV-2 infection assays in ACE2/TMPRSS2 A549 acceptor cells. Relative
infection is determined by RT-qPCR or immunohistochemistry of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein (N).
(F) Representative immunofluorescence (nucleocapsid protein, red; nuclei/DAPI, blue) of A549 cells,
48-hours post-infection by SARS-CoV-2. Top: cells pre-treated with indicated dose of MBCD,
followed by wash; bottom: pre-treatment of virus.
(G) Similar to Figure 7F, but using RT-qPCR to quantify viral titer (RNA copies per mL cell media)
following MBCD-treatment of virus (top) or cells (bottom). Identical controls plotted on both graphs
for visualization purposes: UT = untreated cells, NI = non-infected cells. Mean and SEM indicated
for n=4 independent biological replicates (black dots). P-values of <0.05 and <0.01 are
represented by * and **, respectively.
(H) Graphical model of the biomolecular interactions required for SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated
membrane fusion. Bottom: palmitoylated cysteines (blue) act as multivalent membrane contacts,
anchoring trimeric spike peplomers (green) to the phospholipid bilayer (black) and potentially
allowing transient higher-order assemblies of trimers. Aromatic residues (e.g. tryptophans) at the
spike ectodomain-membrane interface associate with accessible cholesterol (yellow) to promote
synapse-like clusters with ACE2 receptors (red) on apposing membranes. Without these collective
interactions, spike’s fusion machinery (e.g. fusion peptide and heptad repeats) is unable to
surmount the energetically costly barrier to lipid bilayer mixing, both in virus-cell (top, left) and cellcell fusion (top, right).

METHOD DETAILS
Plasmid construction. Lentiviral plasmids encoding fluorescently tagged proteins of interest were
cloned as described in previous work (Sanders et al., 2020), which introduced monomeric fluorescent
protein (GFP, mCherry, miRFP670) lentiviral vectors (FM5, ubiquitin C promoter) with standardized
linkers/overlaps to allow Gibson assembly-based cloning in high \-throughput. With the exception of IDTsynthesized open-reading frames (p14, MYMK, MYMX), DNA fragments coding proteins of interest were
amplified by PCR (oligonucleotides synthesized by IDT; see KEY RESOURCES table for origin of cDNA
template), using Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs or “NEB”). Gibson
assembly (In-Fusion HD cloning kit, Takara) was used to insert gel-purified DNA (Qiagen, Gel Extraction
Kit) into the desired lentiviral vector, linearized by NheI restriction enzyme (NEB) or AscI restriction
enzyme (NEB) digestion. DNA was extracted from transformed Stellar competent bacteria (Takara) by
mini-prep (Qiagen). DNA inserts were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ), reading from both
ends of the open reading frame.
To generate pLMN8-Gluc, the secreted version of Gluc gene was PCR amplified using Q5 polymerase
(NEB) using gene specific primers purchased from IDT. The PCR amplicon was inserted into the SfiIdigested pLMN8 plasmid (Ploss et al., 2009) via In-Fusion cloning (Takara). The sequence of the
resulting pLMN8 plasmid encoding secreted Gluc (pLMN8-Gluc) was confirmed by Sanger sequencing
(Eton Bioscience). Mammalian cell, codon optimized pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) was kindly
provided by BEI resources (NIH). Retroviruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein
(VSV-G) were used as positive controls. pLMN8-Gluc and pMLV gag-pol plasmids were amplified in NEB
stable competent cells (NEB); pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 spike and pVSV-G, DH5α competent cells
(ThermoFisher), then plasmids were purified by Nucleobond Xtra Midi (Takara).
Cell culture. A549, VeroE6, and Calu3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). 293T cells were a kind gift from Marc Diamond (UT Southwestern); U2OS cells, Tom Wuir
(Princeton University); Beas2B cells, Celeste Nelson (Princeton University); A549 cells expressing
human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-hACE2/TMPRSS2), Mohsan Saeed (Boston University). All cell
lines were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM with high glucose and pyruvate,
ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco), with the exception of: A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2, which were
additionally maintained under puromycin (Sigma) and blasticidin (VWR) selection (both at 0.5 µg/mL);
and Calu3 cells, which were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential media (EMEM, ATCC) with 10% FBS
and 1% P/S. All cells were propagated at 37°C in a 5% CO2, 20% O2 environment.
Lentivirus production. Lentiviruses encoding fluorescently tagged proteins of interest were produced by
using a previously optimized protocol (Sanders et al., 2014). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected
with indicated FM5 construct and two helper plasmids (VSVG and PSP; driven cross-country from Marc
Diamond lab, UT Southwestern) with Lipofectamine-3000 (Invitrogen; manufactured in Lithuania for some
reason). Given the fact that is the year 2020 and transient transfection is a boondoggle of confounds,
lipid-based transfection reagents were avoided with exception of virus production. Supernatant was
collected 2-3 days post-transfection, cell debris was pelleted/discarded using centrifugation (1000xg),
and lentivirus-containing media was used to infect indicated cell line in 96-well plates or stored at -80°C.
Generation of stable U2OS and VeroE6 cell lines. Lentivirus transduction was performed in 96-well
plates as described (Sanders et al., 2020) with minor modifications. For large, inefficiently packaged
spike constructs, 180 µL lentivirus supernatant was added to a single well of 96-well plate. For smaller
constructs, 30 or 60 µL lentivirus supernatant was applied. Washed, trypsinized, and media-quenched

cells were added directly to virus, so at ~10-20% confluency upon adhesion to the dish surface. Cells
were grown for three days in lentivirus to obtain confluence, which maximizes viral transduction efficiency
and resulting protein expression. Stable lines were washed, trypsinized, and passaged to 12-well then 6well dishes prior to long-term storage in liquid nitrogen (freezing media = 90% FBS, 10% DMSO). All
stable lines were subsequently maintained and passaged in 6-well plates until needed for live-cell
microscopy experiments. Typically, stable cell lines were passaged at least 3-times over 8+ days prior to
analysis. This allows elimination of cells expressing lethal levels of the fusion protein of interest. In all
experiments, at least 90% of cells in a given population expressed indicated protein (or proteins). With
few exceptions (e.g. B7 TM-GFP cells), stable cells featured <5 µM protein of interest on plasma
membrane (much less if averaged across entire cell), as estimated by fluorescence calibrations
described in previous work (Sanders et al., 2020). The utilized protocol minimizes over-expression
artifacts and is preferred to lipid-based transient transfection (e.g. Lipofectamine-3000), which can further
disrupt plasma membrane integrity and induce stress responses/toxicity.
For all described fluorescent fusion proteins, proper localization to the cell’s plasma membrane was
confirmed by live cell confocal microscopy. In the case of certain spike variants (e.g. Δ815/Δ816,
“ΔS2’CS”), expression was unexpectedly low despite multiple rounds of lentivirus transduction, and
tagged protein was confined to the endoplasmic reticulum. Such behavior was independent of fluorescent
tag (e.g. mCherry, miRFP670, mGFP) and is assumed to indicate misfolding, which decreases the
likelihood of effective post-translational processing by the secretory pathway. These constructs were
discarded or not studied in detail, as direct contribution to a given phenotype would be impossible to
ascertain. In the case of spike “ΔS2’CS” (Δ815/Δ816), additional variants were analyzed (e.g. S813G),
binding to ACE2 was confirmed (transcellular synapses), and cleavage site essentiality for membrane
fusion was assessed.
Live cell confocal microscopy. Stable cell lines were plated on fibronectin-coated, 96-well glass bottom
dishes (Cellvis) and immediately imaged (in the case of experiments requiring observation of individual
fusion events) or following 24-hours culture (e.g. comparison of relative fusion between spike variants). A
Nikon A1 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with 60x oil immersion lens (numerical aperture
of 1.4) was used to collect confocal images. A humidified incubator kept cells at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Proteins tagged with EYFP, mGFP (“GFP”), mCherry, or miRFP670 (“iRFP”) were imaged with 488, 488,
560, and 640 nm laser lines, respectively, and settings were optimized to minimize photobleaching and to
negate bleed-through between channels. With the exception of heterokaryon co-culture assays, all
confocal microscopy was performed on living cells to eliminated fixation-associated artifacts in subcellular
localization.
MBCD TMR-cholesterol labeling and TIRF imaging. Cells were incubated with TopFluor® TMRcholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids #810385) complexed with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD) in a 1:10
ratio (chol: MβCD). Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy Images were collected on
Nikon A1R+STORM (Nikon Ti2 frame) equipped with 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm laser
sources (Nikon LUN-F), a Princeton Instruments ProEM EMCCD camera, and SR HP Apo TIRF
100x/1.49 oil lens (MRD01995). The N-STORM module was used in TIRF mode and the TIRF angle was
adjusted manually.
Heterokaryon co-culture assay. U2OS cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike-iRFP and ACE2-iRFP with
their respective nuclear markers HNRNPA1-EYFP and FUS-mCherry were grown in 10-cm cell culture
dishes (ThermoFisher), trypsinized with 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (ThermoFisher), resuspended in DMEM
(10% FBS, 1% P/S), and mixed in 1:1 ratio. 5.4×10! cells were immediately seeded per well into a glassbottomed 384-well plate (CellVis) to a total of 80 µL volume using a Multidrop Combi SMART liquidhandling dispenser (ThermoFisher). Unless indicated, cells were incubated at 37°C for 5-hours, fixed with

4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services 16% PFA stock solution from freshly opened glass
ampules was added directly to media to minimize variability between wells) for 10-minutes, washed with
DPBS (Gibco), and stained with Hoechst (200 ng/mL). For VeroE6 cells co-cultures, the above procedure
was followed exactly, replacing the ACE2-expressing U2OS cells with VeroE6 cells expressing FUS-mCh
nuclear markers. Unlike U2OS cells, VeroE6 monkey cells feature endogenous ACE2 expression and are
readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Targeted compound dose-response assays. For the targeted compound screen (Figure 3),
compounds were purchased and dissolved in water, methanol or DMSO to achieve stock solutions at
~2000-fold concentration commonly reported by literature. Serial dilutions (7-doses, 3-fold dilutions
unless indicated) were prepared in 20 µL DMEM per well and 5.4×10! cells of each cell type (40 µL
volume per) were added to a final volume of 100 µL (0.5% DMSO). Heterokaryon co-culture assays were
carried out as described above.
Unbiased drug repurposing screen. For drug repurposing screen of 5985 compound library (derived
from seven different commercial small molecule libraries; see KEY RESOURCES table), the described
ACE2-U2OS heterokaryon assay was carried out by adding co-culture to 384-well plates with compounds
pre-dispensed. Specifically, 240 nL of compound (10 mM, in dissolved in DMSO) was added using
ECHO 550 (Labcyte) liquid dispenser to generate a final compound concentration of 30 µM upon addition
of 80 µL cell co-culture.
Dose-response validation of hits from drug repurposing screen. For 7-point, dose-response assay,
appropriate volumes of compound as 10 mM DMSO solution were dispensed using ECHO 550 (Labcyte)
liquid dispenser to generate final concentrations of 40, 20, 10, 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 µM upon addition of
80 µL cell co-culture. Wells were back-filled as necessary to keep the total DMSO volume of 320 nL
consistent for all wells, including negative control, so as to maintain 0.4% DMSO concentration. To
validate the top-24 hits, compounds were purchased from independent suppliers, dissolved in DMSO at
10 mM stock concentrations, and dispensed in 7-point dilutions according to procedure above.
Automated fixed cell confocal imaging and data acquisition. Heterokaryon assay development,
characterization and high-throughput screening was carried out on a Eclipse Ti2 inverted scanning
confocal microscope (Nikon) equipped with an automated Water Immersion Dispenser (WID). Wells were
characterized by 16 full field of view regions (211x211 µm) imaged with a 60x, 1.2-numerical aperture,
water-immersion, Nikon objective with 512x512 resolution. Bi-directional scanning with Hoechst (405
excitation/425-475 emission filter; channel 1), GFP (488/500-550; channel 2), and mCherry (561/570620; channel 3) channels were acquired by a [2]->[1,3] line series through a 50 µm pinhole at a rate of
one image per second. An automated image acquisition protocol was developed in the Nikon NISElements JOBS module to navigate within each well and over the 384-well plate. Automated image
processing and all subsequent analyses were implemented in MATLAB R2017b. See QUANTIFICATION
AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS for details.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Stable U2OS cell lines expressing indicated
GFP-labeled proteins of interest were cultured for 24-hours on a 96-well glass-bottom dish (CellVis) and
imaged using a Nikon A1 laser-scanning confocal microscope as described. Photobleaching was
performed by scanning a 488-nm laser over a circular region of interest ~6.5 µm in diameter, while
focusing on the plasma membrane of single cells, validated by carefully tuning the focus to a plane
bellow the non-fluorescent nuclei until they were no longer observable (compare transmitted light and
fluorescent images in Figure 6A) and fluorescence signal within the surrounding area reached its
maximum. See QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS for analysis.

Protein partitioning measurements in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). Cell membranes
were stained with 5 µg/ml of Texas Red DHPE or Annexin V 647 (ThermoFisher), respectively, red or farred fluorescent lipid dyes that strongly partition to disordered phases (Baumgart et al., 2007; Klymchenko
and Kreder, 2014; Stone et al., 2017). Following staining, GPMVs were isolated as described (Sezgin et
al., 2012) from U2OS stable cells lines expressing the protein of interest (LAT results were obtained from
transient co-transfections). Briefly, GPMV formation was induced by 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in
hypotonic buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4. To quantify
partitioning, GPMVs were observed on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon) at 4°C after
treatment with 200 µM DCA to stabilize phase separation; this treatment has been previously
demonstrated not to affect raft affinity of various proteins (Castello-Serrano et al., 2020). The partition
coefficient (Kp,raft) for each protein was calculated from fluorescence intensity of the construct in the raft
and non-raft phase for >10 vesicles/trial, with multiple independent experiments (n=3) for each construct.
Generation of retroviral pseudoparticles. All pseudotyped retroviruses were generated by cotransfection of plasmids encoding (1) a provirus containing the Gaussia luciferase reporter gene (LMN8Gluc), (2) mouse leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol (Ploss et al., 2009), and (3) codon-optimized SARS-CoV2 spike.
On the day prior to transfection, 1.4 x 107 293T cells were seeded in a 150-mm tissue culture dish. The
following day, a total of 15 µg of total DNA was transfected using 90 µL X-tremeGENE HP DNA
Transfection Regent (Roche). To generate luciferase reporter SARS CoV-2-Spp and VSV-Gpp controls,
(1) pLMN8-Gluc, (2) MLV gag-pol, and (3) either SARS CoV-2 spike or VSV-G were co-transfected at a
ratio of 4.5:4.5:1, giving rise to SARS-CoV-2pp and VSV-Gpp, respectively. No envelope pseudoparticles
(NEpp) was also generated using (1) pLMN8-Gluc and (2) MLV gag-pol at a ratio of 1:1. Media was
replaced after 6-18 hours with DMEM containing 3% FBS, nonessential amino acids (NEAA, 0.1 mM,
ThermoFisher), HEPES (20 mM, ThermoFisher), polybrene (4 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich). Supernatants were
harvested at 48- and 72-hours after transfection, pooled and filtered (0.45 µm pore size), aliquoted, and
stored at -80°C until usage.
Pseudovirus blocking assay. Blocking assays with luciferase reporter pseudovirus were performed in
poly-L-lysine coated flat-bottom 96-well plates using 1.5x104 A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells per well. The
next day, all compounds (10 mM diluted in DMSO) except for MBCD were diluted to 50 µM by DMEM
containing 3% FBS, NEAA (0.1 mM), HEPES (20 mM), polybrene (4 µg/ml) and penicillin-streptomycin.
MBCD (40 mM diluted in PBS) was diluted to 2 mM by DMEM containing 0.5% DMSO, 3% FBS, NEAA
(0.1 mM), HEPES (20 mM), polybrene (4 µg/ml), and penicillin-streptomycin. The final concentration of
DMSO for all compounds was 0.5%. Two-fold serial dilutions of all compounds were co-cultured with cells
for 2-hours at 37°C, and subsequently, the same volume of pseudovirus was added into the cells and
incubated for 4-hours at 37°C. After incubation, wells were washed once with 100 µl Hank’s Buffered
Saline Solution (HBSS, ThermoFisher), and the media changed to 100 µL DMEM containing 3% FBS,
NEAA (0.1 mM), HEPES (20 mM), polybrene (4 µg/mL), and penicillin-streptomycin.
Pseudovirus luciferase assay. Luciferase assay were performed 48-hours after incubation. The
supernatants were collected to assess Gaussia luciferase activity using Genecopoeia Luc-Pair Renilla
luciferase HS Assay Kit (GeneCopoeia) following the manufacturer’s instruction and measured on a
Tristar2 LB942 luminometer (Berthold Technologies).
SARS-CoV-2 isolate stock preparation and titration. All replication-competent SARS-CoV-2
experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3) at the Boston University’ National
Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories. Experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3

was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and BEI Resources. To generate the
passage 1 (P1) virus stock, Vero E6 cells, pre-seeded the day before at a density of 10 million cells, were
infected in T175 flasks with the master stock, diluted in 10ml final volume of Opti-MEM. Following virus
adsorption to the cells at 37ºC for 1h, 15ml DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1X penicillin/streptomycin
was added to the flask. The next day, media was removed, cell were rinsed with 1X PBS and 25 ml of
fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS was added. Two days later, when the cytopathic effect of the virus was
clearly visible, culture medium was collected, filtered through a 0.2µ filter, and stored at -80ºC. Our P2
working stock of the virus was prepared by infecting Vero E6 cells with the P1 stock, at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.1. Cell culture media was harvested at day two and day three post infection, and after
the last harvest, ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter Optima L-100k; SW32 Ti rotor) for 2h at 25,000rpm
over a 20% sucrose cushion. Following centrifugation, the media and sucrose were discarded and pellets
were left to dry for 5 minutes at room temperature. Pellets were then resuspended over night at 4°C in
500ul of 1X PBS. The next day, concentrated virions were aliquoted at stored at -80ºC.
The titer of our viral stock was determined by plaque assay. Vero E6 cells were seeded into a 12-well
plate at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well, and infected the next day with serial 10-fold dilutions of the
virus stock for 1h at 37ºC. Following virus adsorption, 1 ml of overlay media, consisting of 2X DMEM
supplemented with 4% FBS and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 1.2% Avicel (DuPont; RC-581), was added in
each well. Three days later, the overlay medium was removed, the cell monolayer was washed with 1X
PBS and fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were then
washed with 1X PBS and stained for 1h at room temperature with 0.1% crystal violet prepared in 10%
ethanol/water. After rinsing with tap water, the number of plaques were counted and the virus titer was
calculated. The titer of our P2 virus stock was 4 x 108 PFU/ml.
SARS-CoV-2 cholesterol depletion assay. The day prior infection, A549 expressing hACE2 and
hTMPRSS2 cells were seeded at a density of 2x104 per well in a poly-L-lysine coated flat-bottom 96-well
plate. The next day, MBCD initial stock was prepared at a concentration of 20 mM in 1X PBS and 2-fold
serial dilutions were then made using 1X PBS. Prior to infecting cells, a one-hour pretreatment of MBCD
with SARS-CoV-2 virus or cells was carried out. Viral pretreatment was performed by mixing 25 ul of
each MBCD dilution with 25 ul of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.5; 1x104 PFU) per well then incubated for onehour at 37°C. For cell pretreatment, media was removed from wells and cells were washed once with 1X
PBS. Cells were then incubated for one-hour at 37°C with 25 ul of each MBCD dilution further diluted in
25ul of 1X PBS. Following pretreatments, media or PBS/MBCD mixes were removed from wells and
wells were washed twice with 1X PBS. Untreated and MBCD-treated cells were then infected for onehour at 37°C with 50ul of SARS-CoV-2 pretreated with MBCD, or with untreated SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of
0.5), respectively. One hour following virus adsorption, media was removed, cells were washed twice with
PBS, and 200uL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin was added in each well.
Forty-eight hours post infection, cell culture media was harvested and stored at -80°C. Cells were
washed twice with 1X PBS, and fixed with 200ul of 10% neutral buffered formalin for one hour at room
temperature. Cells were then washed twice with 1X PBS, and taken out of the BSL-3 laboratory.
SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR. To determine SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies, total viral RNA was isolated from cell
culture media using a Zymo Research Corporation Quick-RNATM Viral Kit (Zymo Research) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was quantified using single-step RT-quantitative real-time PCR
(Quanta qScript One-Step RT-qPCR Kit; VWR) with primers and Taqman probes targeting the SARSCoV-2 E gene as previously described (Corman et al., 2020). Briefly, a 20 µL reaction mixture containing
10 µL of Quanta qScript™ XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix, 0.5 mM Primer E_Sarbeco_F1
(ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT), 0.5 mM Primer E_Sarbeco_R2 (ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCA
CACA), 0.25 mM Probe E_Sarbeco_P1 (FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-BHQ1), and 2 µL
of total RNA was subjected to RT-qPCR using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 (ThermoFisher). The

following cycling conditions were used: reverse transcription for 10-minutes at 55°C and denaturation at
94°C for 3-minutes followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15-seconds and annealing/
extension at 58°C for 30-seconds. Ct values were determined using QuantStudioTM Design and Analysis
software V1.5.1 (ThermoFisher). For absolute quantification of viral RNA, a 389 bp fragment from the
SARS-CoV-2 E gene was cloned onto pIDTBlue plasmid under an SP6 promoter using NEB PCR cloning
kit (New England Biosciences). The cloned fragment was then in vitro transcribed (mMessage mMachine
SP6 transcription kit; ThermoFisher) to generate a RT-qPCR standard.
SARS-CoV-2 immunofluorescence. Virus-infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30minutes. The fixative was removed and the cell monolayer was washed twice with 1x PBS. The cells
were permeabilized in 1x PBS + 0.1% Triton-X (PBT) for 15-minutes at room temperature and washed
twice with 1x PBS. The cells were blocked in PBT + 10% goat serum (v/v) and 1% BSA (w/v) for 1-hour
at room temperature before incubating overnight at 4ºC with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid
antibody (1:2,000 dilution). The cells were then washed 5 times with 1x PBS and stained with Alexa568conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000 dilution) in the dark at room temperature for 1-hour. The
cells were washed 5 times with 1x PBS and counterstained with DAPI (1:1000). Images were acquired
using the MuviCyte Live Cell Imaging System (PerkinElmer). Six images were captured per well with a 4x
objective lens in an unbiased manner.
Human pathology. Human pathology studies were performed with the approval of the Institutional
Review Board at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Clinical autopsies with full anatomic dissection were
performed on SARS-CoV-2 decedents by a board-certified anatomic pathologist (RFP) with appropriate
infectious precautions. Lung samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin,
sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard methods. Immunohistochemistry was
performed on 4-µm-thick tissue sections following pressure cooker antigen retrieval (Target Retrieval
Solution; pH 6.1; Agilent Dako) using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against TTF-1 (clone
8G7G3/1; Agilent Dako) at 1:200 dilution. Control lung slides were obtained from the BWH Department of
Pathology Autopsy Division archives. Glass slides were reviewed by a RFP using an Olympus BX41
microscope, and microscopic photographs were obtained with an Olympus DP27 camera and Olympus
CellSens Entry software.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Automated fixed cell image analysis. Automated image analyses were performed using MATLAB
R2017b (MathWorks). The fraction of cells fused was measured by adaptive segmentation of a maximal
intensity projection of the three image channels to delineate nuclei. For each nucleus, area and mean
intensity of both nuclear markers in the GFP and mCherry channels was measured. Nuclei with area less
than 10-µm2 after gaussian filtering and erosion were removed. Remaining nuclei with mean GFP or
mCherry channel signal more than 50-digital levels above background were considered nuclear markerpositive. GFP/mCherry double-positive nuclei were designated as part of a syncytium. The fraction of
cells fused was calculated per well as the ratio of syncytium- to nuclear marker-positive nuclei. Total
nuclei per well was z-score-normalized to the plate negative control wells and considered viable when >3.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Analysis was performed in MATLAB R2017b
(MathWorks) by selecting a circular ROI, ~4 µm in diameter, co-centered with the photobleached spot as
well as a reference unbleached region of similar size for photobleaching correction. FRAP traces were
corrected for photobleaching and fitted to a standard exponential decay model of the form: 𝐼(𝑡) = 𝐴(1 −

𝑒 !!" ), with the mobile fraction 𝐴 and the decay time constant 𝜏 being free parameters. Recovery half-life
𝜏!/! was derived using the relation 𝜏!/! = 𝑙𝑛(2) 𝜏.
Cheminformatics analysis. SMILES strings of all analyzed compound libraries were batch-processed in
ChemAxon (version 20.8.2) by first correcting each compound to its major tautomeric and protonation
state at a physiologically relevant pH of 7.4. A total of 20 physicochemical parameters were calculated for
each compound. A Mann Whitney U test was conducted in R software (version 3.4.3, 2017) to assess
statistically significant differences between libraries.
The compounds tested in the fusion screen were divided into two libraries: “non-hits”, containing all nontoxic molecules that passed quality control and with a z-score (fusion) > -3.0 (n=5551); and “hits”,
containing non-toxic molecules that passed quality and had a z-score (fusion) < 3.0 (n=163). Both
libraries were filtered for empty wells for which no SMILES codes were available (n=210 in non-hits and 1
in hits), yielding a final number of 5504 compounds of non-hits and 162 compounds in hits.
A list of GPCR inhibitors, which represent approximately 35% of FDA-approved drugs, was provided by
previous work (Sriram and Insel, 2018). DrugBank (version 5.1.7) was downloaded and queried with the
list to obtain SMILES codes, yielding the final GPCR library (n=459) for batch processing and analysis in
ChemAxon as described above.
Box and whisker plots were plotted and linear regression analysis was conducted in GraphPad Prism
(version 8.0.2) for MacOS.
Scaffold and substructure enrichment analyses. Initial scaffold enrichment analysis was conducted in
NCGC Scaffold Hopper software (version 1.0). The batch-processed SMILES strings from ChemAxon
were input for the hit library (n=163) to identify most common scaffolds present in this library. To assess
enrichment relative to the starting library, the combined hit and non-hit libraries, i.e. all non-toxic
molecules screened in the fusion assay that passed quality control and did not contain empty wells
(n=5714), were input in the software as well. 34 and 981 scaffolds were identified in the hit and starting
libraries, respectively.
To identify the compounds containing the enriched scaffolds, SMILES strings from the top-10 enriched
scaffolds in the hit group were analyzed in RDKit (version 2020.02.5) substructure search module using
Python programming language (version 3.6.12) and IPython (version 7.12.0). Enrichment was assessed
by conducting a pooled population comparison of the frequency of a scaffold in the hit library and the
frequency of that same scaffold in the starting library. These values were then used to calculate z-scores
and two-tailed p-values. Compounds containing statistically significant scaffolds (p-value < 0.05) were
visually inspected to assess if unique and more complex substructures exist. If identified, those SMILES
codes were subjected to another round of substructure search followed by two-tailed p-value calculation
as described.
Bioinformatics. We first acquired the complete set of viral proteins from viruses that infect humans
yielding 1,391,780 proteins (data retrieved October 2020) (UniProt Consortium, 2015). Next, we filtered
for proteins in which two or more transmembrane prediction tools predicted an overlapping
transmembrane helix or a transmembrane helix has been experimentally verified, yielding 168,094
proteins (Käll et al., 2004; Sonnhammer et al., 1998). Of these proteins, we applied a sliding window
approach to assess local density of cysteine residues around the transmembrane helices. Specifically,
we scanned the thirty-residue regions that lie on the N- or C- terminal sides of each transmembrane helix,
using a window size of 20. For each protein the transmembrane-adjacent window with the highest
fraction of cysteine was taken as the protein’s cysteine fractional ‘score’. The complete set of protein
scores is provided in Table S2. To summarize high-confidence hits we first removed redundancy by

filtering for duplicate sequence entries that originated from strain-specific sequence deposition. This final
set is provided as Table S2, with high density hits called out in Figure 5G.
In parallel, we acquired the complete set of human proteins (n = 20370) from Uniprot (data retrieved
October 2020) (UniProt Consortium, 2015). We then similarly filtered for predicted transmembrane
proteins, yielding 5182 candidates (Käll et al., 2004; Sonnhammer et al., 1998). Of these proteins, we
applied the same sliding window approach as for viral proteins as described above. The complete set
of protein scores is provided in Table S3. We further subjected these putatively cysteine-rich
transmembrane proteins to manual filtering to identify “spike-like” human proteins, which feature
cysteine motifs in cytosol and aromatics at the ectodomain-plasma membrane interface. Results are
summarized in Figure 5H with gene ontology (PantherDB) presented in Figure S6D.
