ABSTRACT:
The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized
the need for a better understanding of the evolution of virus-host conflicts. ORF3a in both
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are ion channels (viroporins) and involved in virion assembly
and membrane budding. Using sensitive profile-based homology detection methods, we unify
the SARS-CoV ORF3a family with several families of viral proteins, including ORF5 from
MERS-CoVs, proteins from beta-CoVs (ORF3c), alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), most importantly, the
Matrix (M) proteins from CoVs, and more distant homologs from other nidoviruses. By sequence
analysis and structural modeling, we show that these viral families utilize specific conserved
polar residues to constitute an ion-conducting pore in the membrane. We reconstruct the
evolutionary history of these families, objectively establish the common origin of the M proteins
of CoVs and Toroviruses. We show that the divergent ORF3a/ORF3b/ORF5 families represent
a duplication stemming from the M protein in alpha- and beta-CoVs. By phyletic profiling of
major structural components of primary nidoviruses, we present a model for their role in virion
assembly of CoVs, ToroVs and Arteriviruses. The unification of diverse M/ORF3 ion channel
families in a wide range of nidoviruses, especially the typical M protein in CoVs, reveal a
conserved, previously under-appreciated role of ion channels in virion assembly, membrane
fusion and budding. We show that the M and ORF3 are under differential evolutionary pressures;
in contrast to the slow evolution of M as core structural component, the CoV-ORF3 clade is
under selection for diversification, which indicates it is likely at the interface with host molecules
and/or immune attack.

IMPORTANCE:
Coronaviruses (CoVs) have become a major threat to human welfare as the causative agents of
several severe infectious diseases, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the recently emerging human coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid spread, severity of these diseases, as well as the potential
re-emergence of other CoV-associated diseases have imposed a strong need for a thorough
understanding of function and evolution of these CoVs. By utilizing robust domain-centric
computational strategies, we have established homologous relationships between many
divergent families of CoV proteins, including SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, MERS-CoV

ORF5, proteins from both beta-CoVs (ORF3c) and alpha-CoVs (ORF3b), the typical CoV Matrix
proteins, and many distant homologs from other nidoviruses. We present evidence that they are
active ion channel proteins, and the Cov-specific ORF3 clade proteins are under selection for
rapid diversification, suggesting they might have been involved in interfering host molecules

INTRODUCTION
The recent outbreak of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has generated a global
health crisis (1). It is the 7th human disease caused by coronaviruses, after Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (2), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in
2012 (3), and four less-severe infections caused by human coronaviruses 229E (hCoV-229E)
(4), hCoV-NL63 in 2004 (5), and hCoV-HKU1 in 2004 (6). Of these, SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV/SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 belong to the beta coronavirus
clade while hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha coronavirus clade. Although the
broad genomic structure and core gene-composition of these viruses is similar, the pathology
and severity of these viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are markedly distinct. According to the
WHO report, as of October 2020, there have been over 360 million of confirmed cases with over
1 million deaths from COVID-19 globally. Therefore, the need for a better understanding of the
biology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is a major desideratum to combat and prevent the
disease.
Coronaviruses possess a large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome with two third of
the genome coding for the ORF1a/ORF1ab polyprotein. This is followed by several ORFs
encoding so-called structural and accessory proteins, several of which might be variable
between viruses (2). The ORF1 polyprotein is processed into smaller proteins by proteolytic
cleavage catalyzed by one of its constituent components (the peptidase domain) (7), viral
replication, viral RNA-processing (e.g. xEndoU endoRNase domain) and countering of defenses
centered on NAD+/ADP-ribose (Macro domains) (8). The structural and accessory proteins
contribute to virion structure and assembly, virulence and immune manipulation and invasion (2,
9). However, despite concerted experimental studies, the structural understanding of many of
these viral proteins is still missing; for example, in SARS-CoV-2, these include ORF3a, ORF3b,
M, ORF6, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c, ORF10, and certain parts of ORF1a/b. Here, we utilize a
domain-centric computational strategy to systematically study the function and structure of CoV
proteins. In our recent work, we have demonstrated that the mysterious SARS-CoV-2 protein,
ORF8, belongs to a novel family of the immunoglobulin fold. We also showed that ORF8 is fastevolving and its function is likely to disrupt the host immune responses (10). In this study, we
present results on the function and evolution of novel ion channel proteins in CoVs and other
nidoviruses.

Viral ion channels (viroporins) represent a new functional class of proteins which have been
identified in different animal viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C
virus, and influenza A virus (11). These proteins are shown to facilitate several steps of the viral
life cycle from genome replication, viroplasm formation, and virion budding, to viral infection
(11). CoVs also code for their own ion channels. The SARS-CoV ORF3a was found to function
as a potassium-specific channel promoting virus release (12). Thereafter, several other CoV
proteins were shown to display similar ion channel activities, including porcine epidemic
diarrhea virus (PEDV) ORF3 (13), hCoV-229E ORF4a (14), and SARS-CoV envelope (E)
protein (15, 16). Among them, SARS-CoV ORF3a, PEDV ORF3 and hCoV-229E ORF4a,
appear to utilize their three transmembrane (3-TM) region to constitute an ion channel in the
form of either a dimer or a tetramer, whereas SARS-CoV E protein with a 1TM region forms an
ion channel as a pentamer (15, 16). Recently, a similar ion channel activity was also observed
in SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and its structure was solved (17). This provides an opportunity for us to
systematically identify other ion channel proteins in coronavirus and related genomes by using
sensitive profile-based homology detection and structural modeling methods. As a result, we
have identified several homologous protein families, including ORF5 from MERS-CoV, several
proteins from beta-CoVs, and ORF3b from alpha-CoVs. Importantly, we show that the wellknown Matrix (M) proteins from CoVs and several other nidoviruses are also homologous to the
ORF3a proteins and identify their likely ancestral members of the family. We present
evolutionary and structural evidence that they utilize distinct conserved residues to constitute
the ion conducting pore in the membrane. Finally, we reconstructed the genome composition
changes during the evolution of CoVs and other related viruses which suggests an evolutionarily
conserved role of ion channels in viral virion assembly and membrane fusion/budding.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Unification of M/ORF3 ion channel families in CoVs and other nidoviruses
The ORF3a has two domains including a leading 3-transmembrane (3-TM) region and a beta
sandwich domain. We first identified the viral homologs of ORF3a by conducting iterative
sequence searches using PSIBLAST against the NCBI NR database (18). A multiple sequence
alignment was conducted to identify the evolutionarily conserved residues, and the majority of
them are located within the ion channel pore of the 3-TM structure (S1 Fig). Interestingly, when
we used HMM profile-based homology detection against Pfam profiles via HHsearch (19), we
found two other coronavirus families as the significant hits: one is coronavirus M protein (Pfam

ID: PF01635) and the other is ORF3b from alpha-coronavirus (Pfam ID: PF03053). As many
viral proteins are not present in Pfam profiles, we conducted a systematic clustering analysis
and selected the representatives, excluding the ORF1a/b, for a series of HHsearch analysis.
This revealed three other viral protein families that are related to ORF3a and M families,
prototyped by ORF5 of MERS-CoVs, ORF4 of 229E-related bat CoV (NCBI accession number:
ALK28794.1) and ORF3 of Eidolon bat coronavirus/Kenya/KY24/2006 (NCBI accession number:
ADX59467.1). Our analysis extended these relationships to other nidoviruses beyond
coronaviruses leading to the unification of many novel M proteins from fish, reptile, and mammal
ToroVs.
The sequence identity between these protein families are between 10-20% (Fig 1) and they
share the domain composition of having both 3-TM and a β-sandwich domain. In order to
exclude the possibility that their similarity is only due to the presence of 3-TM, we further used
their β-sandwich domains to conduct the HHsearch analysis, which also revealed comparable
results. Fig 1 presents an overall pattern of these viral proteins and their inter-relationship
identified by both sequence-profile and profile-profile searches. Each family segregates as a
dense sub-network, while the families themselves are linked together by connections revealed
mostly via profile-profile analysis. Hence, we term these unified protein families the M/ORF3
superfamily.
Sequence and structural features of the divergent M/ORF3 proteins
Based on both sequence searches and clustering analysis, we divided these proteins into nine
families (Fig 1). All of them share a common domain architecture with the 3-TM region followed
by a β-sandwich domain. We carefully generated a super-alignment for the β-sandwich domains
of these proteins which revealed a comparable eight beta-sheet arrangement despite their low
sequence identity (Fig 2). There are no universally conserved polar residues in these C-terminal

β-sandwich domains indicating they are not enzymatic modules.
As ORF3a of the SARS-CoV clade functions as an ion channel (12, 17), we next asked if other
viral protein families might have similar functions. We generated homology dimeric models for
several representatives of other families (Fig 3) by using the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a structure as
the template (PDB: 6XDC) (17). We then identified the evolutionarily conserved residues for
each viral family and evaluated them for any conserved compositional trends. These viral
families do not share any conserved residues across the whole superfamily (S2-S7 Figs).

However, they display a unique conservation of family-specific polar residues, mostly basic
residues, which are located in the internal surface of ion channel cavity (Fig 3). This indicates
that these residues have been conserved to maintain an aqueous pore within the membranespanning region. Therefore, all the novel viral families are potential ion channels whose
predicted pore-forming regions are defined by family-specific polar residues.
Evolutionary relationship of divergent M/ORF3 families
We next sought to examine the evolutionary relationship of these M/ORF3 proteins. Based on
the version of the super-alignment of the β-sandwich domains, we conducted phylogenetic
analyses using robust Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference methods (20-22). The
relationship of M/ORF3 families parallel the relationship of viruses that contain them (Fig 4A).
The M protein families from ToroVs are clustered together as a firm clade. They form as a sister
group of all coronavirus families. Among these CoV families, the CoV-M protein family forms a
distinct clade which can be further divided into several subfamilies in Delta-, Gamma-, Alpha-,
Beta-CoVs and a new unclassified group typified by a CoV from Guangdong Chinese water
skink (NCBI accession number: AVM87576; Fig 4A). All other CoV families form a second major
clade, suggesting that they likely share a common ancestor. Among them, ORF3b is only
present in alpha-CoVs whereas ORF3c, MERS-CoV ORF5, ORF3u and SARS-CoV/SARSCoV-2 ORF3a are present in different beta-CoV subgroups. Collectively, due to their
relationship with CoV M proteins, we propose to name these divergent ORF3a-like proteins as
CoV Matrix 2 (M2) proteins while the typical CoV M proteins as M1.
The coupled ORF3-like (M2) and M proteins display different evolutionary rates
When we examined the genome organizations of the viruses which contain the M and ORF3like proteins, we found all ORF3-like proteins are strictly coupled with one typical M protein on
the viral genome in an order of ORF3-E-M (Fig 5), where ORF3 represents one of the divergent
ORF3-like (M2) families, E is the envelope protein, and M is the typical matrix protein of CoVs.
The inter-relationships of the alpha- and beta-CoV ORF3-like (M2) families is consistent with the
internal relationship of the coupled M proteins on the same viral genome (Fig 4A). This indicates
that both the ORF3-like (M2) and M proteins have been vertically inherited from the common
ancestor of the alpha- and beta-CoVs.
However, these proteins show striking differences in their evolutionary rates. Within each viral
group, the sequence identity between the ORF3-like proteins is always significantly lower than

the one of the coupled M proteins (Fig 4B). Further, when we compared proteins between
different viral clades, we found the average percent identity of M proteins is about 34.0%,
whereas the average percent identity of ORF3-like (M2) proteins is only 10.0% (Fig 4B). This
indicates that the ORF3 (M2) protein was evolving much faster than the genomically-linked M
protein. To better understand the functional difference between them, we conducted the
column-wise Shannon entropy analysis (Fig 4C). We found that across the length of the whole
alignment, ORF3-like proteins have significantly higher mean column-wise entropy than the M
proteins from the same set of viral genomes (2.22 as opposed to 1.52; p=1.6 x 10-16 for the H0
of congruent means by t-test). By comparing column-wise entropies in both the 20-amino-acid
alphabet and a reduced 8-letter alphabet (where amino acids are grouped based on similar side
chain chemistries), we found a similar result (1.51 for ORF3-like proteins as opposed to 0.92 for
the M proteins; p= 2.2 × 10−7). This also indicates that there is a much greater tendency in the
ORF3-like (M2) proteins to contain a position that differ drastically in side chain chemistry (e.g.
substitution of a charged for a hydrophobic residue) and supports selection for diversification in
these proteins as opposed to their M counterparts. This is also supported by the computation of
the normalized Kulback-Leibler entropy (S8 and S9 Figs), where positions with strongly negative
values indicate a diversifying pressure as opposed to strongly positive values which suggest
preservation of conserved configurations. Former positions are significantly more common in
the ORF3-like (M2) proteins as opposed to the M-protein (Kruskal-Wallis test, p= 10-12).
In conclusion these results suggest that the M proteins are undergoing purifying selection and
might have been shielded to a degree from attacks by the host immune system, whereas the
ORF3-like proteins are likely to be at the interface of the interactions between the host and virus.
Evolution of virion assembly mode of CoVs, ToroVs, and other related nidoviruses
Other than M and ORF3-like (M2) proteins, several other proteins are also major structural
components of coronavirus, including S, which is a major structural component of the virion
involved in cellular receptor binding (23), E, which is a 1-TM ion channel protein critical for
envelope formation and membrane budding (24), and N which is essential for viral genome
packaging and virion assembly (25, 26). Hence, we investigated if they also show a pattern
similar to that of the M/ORF3 proteins. We conducted a genomic composition analysis by using
both similarity-based clustering and domain analysis for CoVs, ToroVs, and other known
nidoviruses such as roniviruses, mesnidoviruses and arteriviruses (Fig 5).

Consequently, we found that the Spike proteins of three major lineages of nidoviruses such as
CoVs, ToroVs, and mesnidoviruses show a conservation at their C-terminal regions (SC; Pfam
domain: PF01601) while their N-terminal regions display variations in which the CoV-Spike
contains the characteristic NTD and RBD for receptor binding whereas other viral Spikes
contain apparently-unrelated regions (Fig 5). The M proteins from both CoVs and ToroVs share
a similar architecture of 3TM and β-sandwich domains. Interestingly, we found that Arterivirus
contains two proteins with distinct 3TM domains, so-called M and GP5 (S10 and S11 Figs).
Both of their N-terminal 3TM domains share similarity and conserved polar residues with the
M/ORF3-3TM domain, but their C-terminal domain is an unrelated shorter domain with just 6 βstrands (S10 and S11 Figs). This indicates that the 3TM-type ion channels of the CoVs, ToroVs,
and Arterviruses share a common ancestry, but their coupled β-strand-rich C-terminal domains
might have different origins. In the case of the N protein, its C-terminal dimerization domain (NC in Fig 5) shows a wide distribution among ToroVs and Arteriviruses, in addition to CoVs (S12
Fig). These proteins do not possess the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-N; instead they
carry a long N-terminal region which contain a stretch of basic residues (S12 Fig); therefore, we
predict that this region functions equivalently in binding negatively-charged RNA viral genome.
The E protein and RBD of CoV N are found in all CoVs sharing the common gene order of S-EM-N. This genomic organization was further modified in alpha- and beta-CoVs which acquired
an ORF3-like (M2) gene between the S and E genes. It is likely that ORF3 was derived from a
duplication event of M at the ancestor of alpha- and beta-CoVs. Thus, the genome composition
analysis helps reconstruct the series of evolutionary events that resulted in the current complex
form of the structural proteins of CoVs and other nidovirus (Fig 5).
Other than this buildup, we also observed additional lineage-specific genes. For example, the
SARS-related clade has several new genes including ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8 which were
inserted between M and N genes (10), while the MERS-CoVs, which have several genes were
inserted between Spike and ORF5 genes. They could be newly introduced structural
components during evolution.
FINAL REMARKS
Thus, we have systematically unified and classified many divergent ion channel proteins across
several major lineages of nidoviruses, including CoVs, ToroVs and Arterivirus. We show that the
core virion component, M proteins of CoVs and ToroVs, share a similar architecture and utilize
conserved polar residues to form an ion channel in the membrane. Viral ion channels have

earlier been extensively studied in the influenza virus – the transcript of the M1 gene of that
virus is alternatively spliced in nuclear speckles to give rise to the mRNA M2 that codes for a
proton channel needed for acidification and release of viral ribonucleoproteins in the endosome
during invasion (27). This, together with the current observations, suggests that establishment
of ionic gradients are important for viral function. It is conceivable that different representatives
of the nidoviral superfamily unified in this study provide a diversified set of ion-conductance
activities in functions including virion assembly and release.
Our results raise several questions for future research on these viruses: 1) Given that M is the
core structural component of virion, does its predicted ion channel activity contribute to virion
maturation? 2) What might be the effect of the interactions between the M, ORF3a, E, N and
Spike on the predicted conductance of the channels and virion assembly; 3) What are the roles
of ORF3 in terms of its interface with host proteins? The final question is also related to the
roles of the genetic differences in the host factors resulting in widely different disease outcomes
observed for COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein sequence searches and analysis. To collect protein homologs, iterative sequence
profile searches were performed using the programs PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated
BLAST) (18) and JACKHMMER (28), which searched against the non-redundant (nr) protein
database of NCBI with a cut-off e-value of 0.005 serving as the significance threshold.
Similarity-based clustering was conducted by BLASTCLUST, a BLAST score-based singlelinkage clustering method (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html). Multiple
sequence alignments were built using the KALIGN (29), MUSCLE (30) and PROMALS3D (31)
programs, followed by careful manual adjustments based on the profile–profile alignment and
predicted structural information. Sequence-profile and profile-profile comparisons were
conducted using the HHsearch program (19). Secondary structure was predicted using the
JPRED program (32). The consensus of the alignment was calculated using a custom Perl
script. The alignments were visualized using CHROMA program (33) and further modified using
adobe illustrator. The transmembrane regions were predicted using the TMHMM Server v. 2.0
(34).
Protein structure prediction and analysis. The Modeller9v1 program (35) was utilized for
homology modeling of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 M protein, MERS-CoV ORF5, human

NL63-like-CoV ORF3b and Bat-CoV HKU9-2 ORF3c by using the SARS-CoV ORF3a (6xdc) as
a template. The dimeric status was modeled according to the template.
The sequence identity between the template and the targets is very low, from 15% between the
template and the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, 19% with the MERS-CoV ORF5, 15% with the NL63like-CoV ORF3b, to 22% with the Bat-CoV HKU9-2 ORF3c. Since in these low sequenceidentity cases, sequence alignment is the most important factor affecting the quality of the
model (36), alignments used in this analysis have been carefully built and cross-validated based
on the information from HHsearch and edited manually using the secondary structure
information. For each protein, we generated five models and selected the one that had the
highest model accuracy p-value (ranging from 0.06 to 0.013) and global model quality score
(ranging from 0.34 to 0.38) as assessed by ModFOLD6 online server (37). Structural analysis
and comparison were conducted using the molecular visualization program PyMOL (38).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis. Based on the super-alignment of the β-sandwich domains of
nine M/ORF3 families, we conducted phylogenetic analysis using three robust methods,
including the Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis implemented in the MEGA7 program (21), an
approximately-maximum-likelihood method implemented in the FastTree 2.1 program (20), and
Bayesian Inference implemented in the BEAST 1.8.3 program (22). For ML analysis, initial
tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and
BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then
selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was
used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4 categories (+G, parameter =
5.2604)). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I],
4.41% sites). A bootstrap analysis with 100 repetitions was performed to assess the significance
of phylogenetic grouping. For FastTree analysis, default parameters were applied, which include
the WAG evolutionary model and the discrete gamma model with 20 rate categories. For
Bayesian inference, a JTT amino acid substitution model with a discrete Gamma distribution
(four rate categories) was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) duplicate runs of 10 million states each, sampling every 10,000
steps was computed. Logs of MCMC runs were examined using Tracer 1.7.1. Burn-ins were set
to be 4% of iterations.

The tree with the highest log likelihood from the ML analysis was visualized using the FigTree
1.4.4 program (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/). The bootstrapping values and Posterior values are
shown next to the branches.
Entropy analysis. Position-wise Shannon entropy (H) for a given multiple sequence alignment

was calculated using the equation:
P is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i, and M is the number of amino acid types. The
Shannon entropy for the ith position in the alignment ranges from 0 (only one residue at that
position) to 4.32 (all 20 residues equally represented at that position) in a 20 letter alphabet.
Kullback-Leibler divergence (or relative entropy) was computed as described in (39), then
centered by the mean and normalized by the range to identify the functionally constrained and
diverging positions. Analysis of the entropy values which were thus derived was performed
using the R language.
Genome composition analysis. Open reading frames of viral genomes used in this study were
extracted from NCBI GenBank files (40). Protein sequences were subjected to similarity-based
clustering by BLASTCLUST with -S at 0.4 and -L at 0.4. Protein clusters were further annotated
with conserved domains which are identified by the hmmscan searching against Pfam (19, 41)
and our own curated profiles. For previously unknown domains, we used sequence searches
followed by multiple sequence alignment and further sequence-profile searches to study their
sequence and structural features.

where the arrow indicates the search direction. The probabilities of the HHsearch comparisons
with full-length protein sequences and C-terminal β-sandwiches (in brackets) are indicated,
followed by the percentage sequence identity.
Fig 2. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of β-sandwich domains of nine M/ORF3 protein
families. The secondary structure is shown above the alignment and the consensus is shown
below the alignment, where h stands for hydrophobic residues, s for small residues, b for big
residues, and p for polar residues. The numbers are indicative of the excluded residues from
sequences. Sequences from three human-infected CoVs are highlighted (SARS-CoV-2 in red,
SARS-CoV in green and MERS-CoV in blue)
Fig 3. Dimeric structures of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and homology models of SARS-CoV-2 M,
human-NL63-like-CoV ORF3b, bat-CoV HKU9-2 ORF3c, and MERS-CoV ORF5. Both the
side-view and top-view are presented. Alpha-helices are colored in green, β-sheets of the βsandwich domains in orange, and loops in grey. The channel cavities are colored in grey. The
polar residues which are conserved in each family are located on the cavity surface, shown in a
purple stick model. The PDB and NCBI ids are shown in brackets.
Fig 4. (A) Evolutionary relationship of M/ORF3 ion channel families of CoVs and ToroVs.
The ML tree with the highest log likelihood (-16934.18) is shown with supporting values for the
major branches from three phylogenetic methods: f for FastTree, m for MEGA-ML and b for BI
posterior values. Sequences are represented by the NCBI accession IDs and those from human
viruses are further labeled with the virus name in red. The cartoon of several viral hosts is
shown; its correspondence with the sequence is indicated by the bold dashed lines. Each family
is highlighted in a different background. For the sequence within the M family, if they are
coupled with one of the ORF3 families, their branches are colored with the same theme,
accordingly. (B) Percent identity comparison between the coupled M and ORF3-like (M2)
proteins within different viral clades and between different clades. (C) Shannon entropy

plot of the M and ORF3-like (M2) proteins. Shannon entropy data computed based on regular
amino acid alphabet (20 amino acids) are shown above the zero line in shades of orange.
Shannon entropy data computed based on a reduced alphabet of 8 residues are shown below
the zero line in shades of blue. Where a position shows high entropy in both alphabets, it is a
sign of potential positive selection at those positions for amino acids of different chemical
characters.
Fig 5. Genomic organization of representative CoVs, ToroVs and other related
nidoviruses. The detailed species tree of the CoV-ToroV clade was adapted from the Fig 4.
The genomic regions encoding for structural and accessory proteins are illustrated right to the
terminal nodes of the phylogenetic tree. The gene names are shown according to their NCBI
genome annotation, but the color of the gene box corresponds to different protein families: all
CoV Spike proteins in grey, SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a in pink, beta-CoV ORF3u in red,
MERS-CoV ORF5 in yellow, beta-CoV ORF3c in sky-blue, alpha-CoV-229E ORF3b in palegreen, typical CoV-M proteins in light-purple, reptile and mammal ToroV M protein in light-green,
fish ToroV M proteins in light-blue, envelope (E) protein in black, SARS-CoV ORF7a-Ig and
ORF8-Ig in dark-green, nucleocapsid (N) protein in blue-green, nucleocapsid (N) protein Cterminal dimerization domain in green, Arterivirus ORF3-like GP5 protein in vermilion and
Arterivirus M protein in purple. Several previously unannotated alpha-CoV ORF3b genes are
recovered and highlighted in dashed boxes. The predicted assembly models (without Spike) are
shown on the right side of genomic organization. Protein abbreviations used in the model are as
follows: MC: M protein C-terminal β-sandwich domain; NN: N protein N-terminal RBD domain;
NC: N protein C-terminal dimerization domain; SC: Spike protein C-terminal domain; 5C:
MERS-ORF5 C-terminal β-sandwich domain; 3aC: SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a C-terminal

β-sandwich domain; 3bC: alpha-CoV-229E ORF3b C-terminal β-sandwich domain; GP5C:
Arterivirus GP5 protein C-terminal β-sandwich domain.
