24

The widespread occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 has had a profound effect on society and a

25

vaccine is currently being developed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the

26

primary host cell receptor that interacts with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the

27

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Although pneumonia is the main symptom in severe cases of

28

SARS-CoV-2 infection, the expression levels of ACE2 in the lung is low, suggesting the

29

presence of another receptor for the spike protein. In order to identify the additional

30

receptors for the spike protein, we screened a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

31

from the lung cDNA library. We cloned L-SIGN as a specific receptor for the N-terminal

32

domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The RBD of the spike protein did not bind

33

to L-SIGN. In addition, not only L-SIGN but also DC-SIGN, a closely related C-type lectin

34

receptor to L-SIGN, bound to the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, cells

35

expressing L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were both infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, L-

36

SIGN and DC-SIGN induced membrane fusion by associating with the SARS-CoV-2 spike

37

protein. Serum antibodies from infected patients and a patient-derived monoclonal antibody

38

against NTD inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressing cells. Our

39

results highlight the important role of NTD in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination through L-SIGN

40

and DC-SIGN and the significance of having anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies in antibody-

41

based therapeutics.

Introduction

44

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel human coronavirus, a severe acute

45

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and

46

requires specific cellular receptors to infect cells in a manner similar to that observed in other

47

enveloped viruses such as the influenza virus and herpesviruses3-7. The spike glycoprotein of

48

SARS-CoV-2 associates with ACE2 on host cells and mediates membrane fusion with the host

49

cell membrane during infection3,4. The spike glycoprotein is organized as a homotrimer and each

50

chain is composed of two main segments, the S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit is responsible

51

for receptor binding, whereas the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion8,9. Within the S1 subunit

52

are two domains known as the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD).

53

The RBD is recognized as the main domain that interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cells

54

and antibodies against RBD block infection9. Although the function of surface-exposed NTD that

55

is structurally coupled with the RBD of the neighboring chain still remains unclear, certain human

56

anti-NTD monoclonal antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection10. This suggests that NTD as

57

well as RBD play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

58

Pneumonia is the primary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe

59

cases11. Although ACE2 is highly expressed in the intestine and kidney, the expression of ACE2

60

in the lung is limited, and relatively low levels of ACE2 expression are observed only in type-II

61

alveolar cells12. Therefore, it has remained unclear how the low levels of ACE2 in the lung are

62

involved in pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, a single-cell RNA

63

sequencing study of bronchoalveolar-lavage samples revealed that viral RNA could be detected in

64

cell populations that did not express ACE213. Taken together, this evidence indicates that ACE2

65

expression alone cannot explain the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and alternative entry

66

receptors might be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2-low or deficient cells. Besides,

67

SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in multiple non-pulmonary organs such as the intestine, liver, kidney,

68

and blood vessels of COVID-19 patients14. Based on these observations, we sought to identify a

69

potential alternative receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using a lung cDNA library and

70

discuss the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination within the host.

71
72

Results

73
74

Lung cDNA library screening identified L-SIGN as a receptor for NTD of the SARS-CoV-2

75

spike protein (SCoV2-NTD).

76

In order to identify a receptor in the lung for the SCoV2-spike protein, we used expression cloning

77

with a lung retrovirus cDNA library. Cells transfected with a lung cDNA library were stained with

78

SCoV2-NTD human IgG-Fc fusion protein (SCoV2-NTD-Fc) as well as RBD-Fc fusion protein

79

(SCoV2-RBD-Fc) and the stained cells were enriched using a cell sorter (Fig. 1a). After two rounds

80

of enrichment, 83.7% of the cells were stained with SCoV2-NTD-Fc (Fig. 1b) while we could not

81

obtain cells stained with SCoV2-RBD-Fc even after three rounds of enrichment. We obtained

82

single-cell clones that were stained with SCoV2-NTD-Fc and amplified the genes derived from

83

the library using PCR. Notably, L-SIGN (CD299) was identified from all the clones that were

84

stained with SCoV2-NTD-Fc (Fig. 1c). Following this observation, the cell clones were stained

85

with antibodies against L-SIGN (Fig. 1d). These data suggested that L-SIGN is a major molecule

86

that interacts with SCoV2-NTD in the lung. Although L-SIGN is mostly expressed in the liver, the

87

lung has the second-highest expression of L-SIGN according to the RNA-seq tissue data obtained

88

from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTE) project (Suppl. Fig. 1).

NTD of the spike facilitates the binding of SCoV2 to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN via unique

91

glycans

92

L-SIGN shares a high amino acid sequence homology and functional similarity with DC-SIGN

93

that is also present in the lung (Suppl. Fig. 1). On the other hand, CD147 has been reported to be

94

involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection15. Accordingly, we transfected L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, ACE2,

95

and CD147 into HEK293T cells and evaluated the binding of NTD- or RBD-Fc fusion proteins

96

(Fig. 2a). We observed that the NTD-Fc bound to both surface-expressed L-SIGN and DC-SIGN

97

transfectants but not to ACE2 and CD147 transfectants. The RBD-Fc fusion protein bound to

98

ACE2 but not L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, or CD147 transfectants. This indicates that the binding of NTD-

99

Fc to L-SIGN or DC-SIGN is mediated by NTD and not the Fc portion. Anti-DC-SIGN mAb

100

blocked the binding of NTD-Fc to DC-SIGN transfectants but not to L-SIGN transfectants (Fig.

101

2b). L-SIGN and DC-SIGN have been shown to bind to intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-

102

3) through sugar chain recognition. In addition, mannan is known to be a ligand of both L-SIGN

103

and DC-SIGN. When DC- or L-SIGN transfectants were preincubated with mannan, the binding

104

of NTD-Fc to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was drastically reduced (Fig. 2b). These data indicate that

105

unique glycans on NTD of SARS-CoV-2 are involved in the interaction with L-SIGN and DC-

106

SIGN.

107

The SCoV spike protein has a high sequence similarity (approximately 76%) to the SCoV2

108

spike protein. However, SCoV-NTD-Fc fusion protein did not bind to DC-SIGN or L-SIGN

109

transfectants unlike the SCoV2-NTD-Fc fusion protein (Fig. 2c). Similarly, DC-SIGN-Fc and L-

110

SIGN-Fc fusion proteins bound to flag-tagged SCoV2 spike transfectants, but bound weakly to

111

SCoV spike transfectants although both transfectants were well stained with anti-flag mAb (Fig.

112

2d). Likewise, DC-SIGN-Fc and L-SIGN-Fc fusion proteins did not bind to the human

113

coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1 (Suppl. Fig. 2). These results also suggested that the NTD of the

114

SCoV2 spike protein is specifically modified by unique glycans that mediate the binding of NTD

115

to L-SIGN and DC-SIGN.

116

There are seven and eight N-glycosylation sites located on the NTD of SCoV and SCoV2,

117

respectively (Fig. 3a). The protein sequence alignment of both NTDs revealed that there are two

118

unique glycosylation sites, i.e., N74 and N149, on the SCoV2-NTD (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, both

119

glycosylation sites are in the most variable region within the NTD. To identify which glycosylation

120

sites interact with DC-SIGN, we substituted SCoV2-NTD glycosylation site Asn (N) with Gln (Q)

121

and analyzed the binding to DC-SIGN (Fig. 3b, c). The mutation at N149Q diminished the NTD

122

binding to DC-SIGN, while N74Q and N282Q mutation resulted in a substantial reduction of the

123

NTD binding to DC-SIGN. These data suggest that unique glycans on N149 of NTD are

124

responsible for the interaction with SIGNs.

125
126

L-SIGN and DC-SIGN mediate SCoV2 infection by inducing membrane fusion

127

It has been reported that L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are involved in infection by several viruses such

128

as HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV. To determine whether L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are involved in

129

SCoV2 infection, we used SCoV2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (SCoV2-PV)

130

carrying a luciferase reporter gene to infect HEK293T cells stably transfected with L-SIGN or DC-

131

SIGN and analyzed the outcome (Fig. 4a, Suppl. Fig. 2). L-SIGN and DC-SIGN transfectants were

132

considerably infected with SCoV2-PV. Furthermore, bona fide SCoV2 also infected L-SIGN and

133

DC-SIGN transfectants. This indicated that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN serve as receptors for SCoV2

134

infection.

135

Being an enveloped virus, membrane fusion between the viral envelope of SCoV2 and the

136

host cell membrane is a critical step in viral infection. To understand the function of L-SIGN and

137

DC-SIGN in membrane fusion during SCoV2 infection, we used a cell-cell fusion assay using a

138

T7 promoter-based luciferase reporter system7,16. In this system, we cocultured effector cells

139

(transfected with SCoV2 spike and T7 polymerase) with target cells (transfected with DC-SIGN

140

or L-SIGN with luciferase gene regulated by a T7 promoter) and the luciferase gene is expressed

141

only when cell-cell fusion between effector cells and target cells is induced. Interestingly, cell-cell

142

fusion activity occurred when effector cells were cocultured with target cells expressing L-SIGN

143

or DC-SIGN (Fig. 4c). Additionally, when effector cells expressing SCoV2 spike protein and red

144

fluorescence protein were cocultured with target cells expressing DC-SIGN and green

145

fluorescence protein, fused cells expressing both red and green fluorescence proteins were detected

146

(Fig. 4d). These data suggest that L-SIGN or DC-SIGN mediate membrane fusion during SCoV2

147

infection of SIGN-expressing cells.

148
149

moDCs facilitate SCoV-2 dissemination in trans via DC-SIGN.

150

We then sought to establish the function of endogenously expressed L-SIGN or DC-SIGN. Since

151

L-SIGN has been reported to be expressed in type II alveolar cells, L-SIGN is likely involved in

152

the SARS-CoV-2 infection of lungs. However, we could not find any cell lines expressing

153

endogenous L-SIGN. On the other hand, DC-SIGN is expressed on monocyte-derived DCs

154

(moDCs). For that reason, we isolated CD14+ cells from human PBMC and differentiated them

155

into DCs in the presence of cytokines, IL-4 and GM-CSF. The moDCs expressed DC-SIGN, low

156

CD14, high MHC-II, and CD74 (Fig. 5a). As observed with DC-SIGN transfectants (Fig. 2),

157

SCoV2-NTD-Fc fusion protein bound to moDCs (Fig. 5b). Anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies

158

and mannan prevented the binding of NTD-Fc to moDCs (Fig. 5c). These results indicated that

159

DC-SIGN was expressed on primary cells associated with the NTD of the SCoV2 spike protein.

160

However, moDCs were not infected with SCoV2-PV, but with the VSV-G PV (Fig. 5d). Recently,

161

CD74 induced by CIITA has been reported to inhibit the membrane fusion of SCoV217. The

162

considerable expression of CD74 by moDCs (Fig. 5a) may confer resistance to SCoV2 infection.

163

Therefore, there is likely that L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressed in CD74 negative cells could play

164

a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

165

NTD-Fc has been observed to bind well to moDCs; therefore, SCoV2 virions bound to DC-

166

SIGN on moDCs may be infectious to other cells. We incubated moDCs with SCoV2-PV followed

167

by extensive washing. Thereafter, moDCs incubated with SCoV2-PV were cocultured with Vero

168

cells. Significant infection was observed in Vero cells and the infection was completely blocked

169

by anti-DC-SIGN antibodies or mannan (Fig. 5e). Due to the general circulation of DCs in the

170

body, SCoV2 bound to DCs via DC-SIGN may be involved in the spread of SCoV2 throughout

171

the body.

172
173

Neutralization of SIGN-mediated SCoV2 infection by antibodies

174

Antibodies are of importance in host defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The function of

175

antibodies in SIGN-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated. 4A8 and 4A2 are COVID-19

176

patient-derived anti-NTD mAbs10 and C144 is an anti-RBD mAb18 (Suppl. Fig. 3). Both 4A8 and

177

C144 have been reported to neutralize SCoV2 infection. Surprisingly, anti-RBD C144 mAbs as

178

well as anti-NTD 4A8 blocked SCoV2-PV infection of HEK-L-SIGN and HEK-DC-SIGN. In

179

contrast, the 4A2 mAb did not block infection (Fig. 6a, b). These data indicate that RBD as well

180

as NTD are involved in SCoV2 infection of SIGN-expressing cells. The effect of antibodies

181

derived from SCoV2-infected patients was investigated; their sera contain antibodies against NTD

182

and RBD (Suppl. Fig. 4). SCoV2-PV infection of DC-SIGN transfectants was hindered by the sera

183

from two SCoV2-infected patients but not from healthy control serum (Fig. 6c). On the other hand,

184

the sera could not neutralize VSV-G PV infection. (Fig. 6d). This shows that SIGN-mediated

185

infection is counteracted by serum antibodies against spike proteins similar to ACE2-mediated

186

infection. In addition, our data imply that antibodies against NTD as well as RBD are useful in

187

blocking SCoV2 infection19,20.

188
189

Discussion

190

SCoV2 is more widespread than its closest human coronavirus, SCoV3, and therapeutic

191

interventions are yet to be identified. ACE2 is the primary receptor that interacts with the SCoV2

192

spike glycoprotein (i.e., RBD) and consequently facilitates viral entry3. However, the

193

understanding of the pathogenesis of SCoV2 remains incomplete, including the mechanism of

194

pneumonia, thrombosis, endothelitis, and cytokine storm, which are often associated with severe

195

cases of the disease21-23. It is unclear how SCov2 causes pneumonia since the expression of ACE2

196

in the lung is relatively low and limited to type-II alveolar cells and some (<2%) of the respiratory

197

epithelial cells12. Additionally, the presence of SCoV2 in non-pulmonary organs14 as well as the

198

detection of viral DNA in non-ACE2 expressing cells13 point to an alternative receptor for SCoV2

199

entry and an unknown virus-spreading mechanism within the host. Recently, neuropilin has been

200

reported to be involved in the SCoV2 cell entry by associating with the proteolytically processed

201

spike protein. However, transfection of neuropilin alone to HEK293 cells did not mediate the

202

SCoV2 infection, and the coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with neuropilin was required for

203

the SCoV2 infection24,25. On the other hand, L-SIGN, cloned from lung cDNA library as an NTD

9

204

binding receptor, and DC-SIGN mediated SCoV2 infection in the absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

205

Indeed, L-SIGN is expressed in lung type-II alveolar cells and endothelial cells26. Furthermore,

206

DCs or specialized macrophages expressing DC-SIGN can be found in the lung27,28. Their

207

localization in the lung further strengthens the increasingly likely role of L-SIGN and DC-SIGN

208

as receptors of SCoV2 and may therefore be important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

209

The interaction of the SCoV2-NTD with L-SIGN and DC-SIGN is specific and glycan

210

dependent. Despite the NTD of SCoV being a highly glycosylated domain, our analyses indicate

211

that the interaction between NTD and DC-SIGN or L-SIGN is apparently unique to the current

212

SCoV2 because L-SIGN-Fc or DC-SIGN-Fc hardly bound to the spike protein of SCoV as well as

213

human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1. Previous findings have shown that SCoV spike protein

214

interacts with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN albeit with a low binding efficiency26,29. Similarly, we

215

observed a very weak binding of DC- and L-SIGN-Fc to SCoV spike protein, whereas the binding

216

to the SCoV2 spike was stronger. The overall glycosylation profile of the SCoV2 spike protein is

217

quite different from that of SCoV30-32 with the N-linked glycan at residue 149 being the major

218

glycan involved in the DC-SIGN and NTD interaction. The N-linked glycosylation site at residue

219

149 of SCoV2-NTD is absent in SCoV-NTD, although other N-linked glycosylation sites are

220

conserved in SCoV-NTD. This may be the reason why L- and DC-SIGN interactions with NTD

221

are more apparent in the current SCoV2. Indeed, both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN recognize a

222

pentasaccharide motif (GlcNAc2Man3)33 that is also present in the glycans at N149 of SCoV2-

223

NTD30.

224

We demonstrated that L-SIGN and DC-SIGN mediate both the pseudotyped and bona fide

225

SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, both L-SIGN and DC-SIGN induce cell-cell fusion via

226

their association with the spike protein. SCoV2 requires proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein

227

by the host proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2) after binding to an entry receptor3. Besides, the lysosomal

228

protease, cathepsin L was shown to proteolytically activate the SCoV spike protein during viral

229

entry thereby facilitating membrane fusion with the host cell membrane34. Recent research

230

revealed that the thyroglobulin domain (cathepsin L inhibitor) of the CD74 p41 isoform blocks the

231

cathepsin L-mediated viral entry of SCoV217. CD74 is an essential molecule for the proper

232

assembling of MHC class II molecules and its expression is regulated by CIITA, a principal

233

transcription factor for MHC class II expression35. Because moDCs express both CD74 and MHC

234

class II molecules favorably, CD74 appears to be responsible for the resistance of moDCs to

235

SCoV2 infection. However, expression of CD74 is largely limited to immune cells such as B cells,

236

monocytes, and dendritic cells, while most cells including endothelial cells do not express CD74.

237

Therefore, L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressing cells that lack CD74 expression appear to be

238

susceptible to SCoV2 infection.

239

We also show that moDCs facilitate pseudotyped SCoV2 infection in Vero cells in trans.

240

Trans-infection by DCs is well reported in HIV infection36. Due to their migration in the body,

241

DCs may function as transporters of SCoV2 by associating with the virus via DC-SIGN to infect

242

cells expressing ACE2 or L-SIGN, which in turn facilitates virus dissemination in the host. This

243

might explain the presence of viral protein in other organs, including the liver14, where L-SIGN is

244

highly expressed in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that do not express CD7437.

245

Furthermore, infection of the endothelial cells of blood vessels may consequently lead to

246

thrombosis, which is frequently linked to severe disease conditions22. Several human tissues

247

express similar mRNA expression levels of L-SIGN as those of the lung, making them likely

248

targets of SCoV2 infection.

249

The presence of neutralizing antibodies for DC-SIGN-mediated SCoV2 infection in

250

COVID-19 patients implies the relevance of NTD as a therapeutic target besides RBD. Notably,

251

the majority of the isolated mAb from SCoV2 patients did not recognize RBD and those mAbs

252

that neutralize SCoV2 failed to prevent binding of the spike to ACE210. In our study, the NTD-

253

specific mAb, 4A8, neutralized SIGN-mediated infection of SCoV2, suggesting the therapeutic

254

potential of anti-NTD antibodies against SIGN-mediated infection. More importantly, anti-RBD

255

mAb also inhibited the SCoV2-PV infection of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN expressing cells. Although

256

HEK293 cells do not express ACE2, certain molecules on HEK293 cells may interact with RBD

257

becoming involved in infection of SIGN-expressing cells. This may suggest that L-SIGN or DC-

258

SIGN is required for the infection of ACE2-low or ACE2-negative cells, where levels are not

259

enough to mediate SCoV2 infection. Further analysis of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN-mediated infection

260

would be important to understand the etiology of SARS-CoV-2-related diseases. Also, targeting

261

SIGN-mediated infection as well as ACE2-mediated infection would be important for effective

262

vaccine development.

cDNA library screening

304

A retrovirus cDNA library was constructed based on a previous study42. Briefly, cDNA was

305

generated from a human lung poly-A+ RNA (cat. 636105, Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) using

306

a cDNA library construction kit (Takara Bio, Japan) and cloned into EcoRI and NotI sites of pMXs

307

retrovirus vector. The ligated cDNA was transformed into XL10-gold and the plasmids were

308

purified using a plasmid plus midi kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). The complexity of the

309

cDNA library was 2 × 106. The cDNA library was then transfected into PLAT-E packaging cells

310

to generate a retrovirus cDNA library. Subsequently, the retrovirus cDNA library was transfected

311

into 2B4 mouse T cell hybridoma and sorted for cells binding to the SCoV2-NTD-Fc fusion protein

312

using an SH800S cell sorter (Sony, Japan). Single-cell clones were obtained and the genomic DNA

313

was then isolated using a Wizard SV genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

Mutagenesis of N-linked glycosylation sites of SCoV2-NTD

320

Single point SCoV2-NTD-Fc N-linked glycosylation site mutants (N61, 74, 122, 149, 165, 234,

321

282Q) were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies,

322

Santa Clara, CA, USA) to change the respective asparagine (N, Asn) residue to glutamine (Q, Gln).

Recombinant DC-SIGN-Fc, L-SIGN-Fc, SCoV-NTD-Fc (amino acids 14–279), SCoV2-NTD-Fc

326

(amino acids 14–292), SCoV2-RBD-Fc (amino acids 335–587), and SCoV2-NTD-Fc N-

327

glycosylation site mutant fusion proteins were independently expressed as a secreted protein using

328

HEK293T cells. The recombinant mAbs, C144, 4A2, and 4A8 were produced using Expi293 cells.

329

The Fc fusion protein in the culture supernatant was quantified using a protein A beads assay.

330

Essentially, the protein A was coupled to 4 µm aldehyde/sulfate latex beads (Invitrogen, USA)

331

according to the manufacturer’s instructions and used to capture the Fc fusion protein in the culture

332

supernatant. The captured Fc fusion proteins were then detected using anti-human IgG-Fc

333

conjugated to APC and measured using flow cytometry. The protein concentration was calculated

334

using a known concentration of IgG-Fc fusion protein as a standard. For recombinant proteins that

335

required purification, the culture supernatant containing the secreted fusion proteins was purified

336

using protein-A conjugated Sepharose beads (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA).

339

FACSVerse™ or FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lake, NJ, USA) was

340

used for flow cytometry analysis. For the binding study, cells were transiently co-transfected with

341

the plasmid containing the respective receptors and GFP using a PEI transfection reagent39. Forty-

342

eight hours post-infection, cells were then stained with Fc fusion proteins for 30 minutes at 4°C in

343

Hank’s buffer containing 0.1% BSA and identified using goat anti-human IgG-Fc-APC Ab prior

344

to flow cytometry analysis. For DC- and L-SIGN blocking experiments, the cells were pre-blocked

345

with 5 µg/mL of anti-CD209 mAb or 50 µg/mL of mannan (Sigma, USA) for 30 minutes before

346

staining with Fc fusion protein. For the staining of the spike protein, DC-SIGN-Fc (5 µg/mL) or

347

L-SIGN-Fc fusion protein (20 µg/mL) premixed with goat anti-human IgG-Fc-APC mAb (3

348

µg/mL) was used. For the analysis of SCoV2-NTD N-linked glycosylation site mutants’

349

interaction with DC-SIGN, 10 µg/mL of each mutant was used. Surface-expressed SCoV2-NTD

350

(amino acids 14–333), SCoV2-RBD (amino acids 335–587), and SCoV2-S2 (amino acids 588–

351

1219) were generated by fusing the respective domains with a transmembrane region derived from

352

PILRα at the C-terminal6.

353
354

Cell-cell fusion assay

355

Effector cells were prepared by transiently transfecting T7 RNA polymerase plasmid, pCAG-T7,

356

and SCoV2 spike plasmid into HEK293T cells. For the target cells, HEK293T cells were

357

transiently co-transfected with T7 promoter-luciferase plasmid, pT7EMCV-Luc, and DC-SIGN in

358

a pcDNA3.4 vector, L-SIGN in a pcDNA3.4 vector, or a pcDNA3.4 empty vector (mock). After

359

two days of transfection, the effector cells (1 × 104 cells) were cocultured with the target cells (1

360

× 104 cells) in a 384-well white plate (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria). The cells were

361

then incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 and the luciferase activity was measured using the

16

362

ONE-Glo™ luciferase assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The

363

signals were recorded using a luminescence plate reader TriStar LB941 (Berthold Technologies,

364

Bad Wilbad, Germany). For the cell-cell fusion assay using fluorescence protein, effector cells

365

were prepared by transiently co-transfecting with SCoV2 spike and red fluorescence protein (pCI-

366

neo-DsREDExp) into HEK293T cells. For target cells, HEK293T cells were transiently co-

367

transfected with DC-SIGN and green fluorescence protein (pMX-GFP). After two days of

368

transfection, the effector and target cells were enriched using a Sony SH800 cell sorter (Sony,

369

Japan) prior to co-culture as described above. Cells were then analyzed using an IX83 Olympus

370

microscope (Olympus, Shinjuku City, Tokyo, Japan).

371
372

SCoV2 spike-pseudotyped virus

373

HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for the SCoV2 spike protein.

374

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, VSV-G-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) carrying

375

a luciferase reporter gene complemented in trans with VSV-G protein43 was added and incubated

376

for two hours. Cells were then carefully washed with DMEM media without FBS and incubation

377

continued with DMEM supplemented with FBS at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The supernatant

378

containing the pseudotyped SCoV2 virions was harvested and aliquoted before storage at −80°C.

380

CD14+ cell preparation and moDCs differentiation

381

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from healthy individuals by

382

centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). CD14+ cells were

383

isolated by positive selection using anti-CD14 conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch

384

Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Monocyte-derived dendritic

385

cells (moDCs) were stimulated as previously described44. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells/mL of CD14+

386

enriched cells were stimulated using recombinant human (rh) GM-CSF and rhIL-4 (BioLegend,

387

USA) at a concentration of each 500 IU/mL in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS at

388

37°C in 5% CO2. The expression of CD209 was detected after two days of stimulation using an

389

anti-CD209 monoclonal antibody.

390
391

Direct infection assay

392

For pseudotyped SCoV2 infection, 5 × 103 cells were mixed with the pseudovirus for 24 hours at

393

37°C in 5% CO2 in a 384-well plate. Luciferase activity was then measured using the ONE-Glo™

394

luciferase assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The signals were

395

recorded using a luminescence plate reader TriStar LB941 (Berthold Technologies, Germany). For

396

neutralization assay, essentially the same protocol was conducted with the exception that the

397

pseudovirus was preincubated with diluted patient sera or anti-NTD, clone 4A8 and 4A2

398

monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients’

399

sera were collected from Osaka University Hospital. Patients’ sera collection was approved by the

400

IRB (No. 19546). Recombinant SCoV2 virus with a high-affinity NanoBiT (HiBiT) luciferase

401

gene in the N-terminus of the ORF6 gene was produced as previously described45. The virus (MOI

402

3) was added to 1.5 × 104 cells for 24 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a 96-well plate. SCoV2 infected

403

cells were collected and luciferase activity was then measured using a Nano-Glo HiBiT lytic assay

404

system (Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The signals were recorded

405

using a luminometer.

408

moDCs were incubated with pseudotyped SCoV2 at 37°C for 60 minutes. For the blocking

409

experiment, moDCs were preincubated with anti-CD209 antibodies (5 µg/mL), mouse IgG2a

410

antibodies (Isotype control), or mannan (100 µg/mL) before incubation with pseudovirus. After

411

incubation, the cells were washed three times with DMEM and subsequently added to Vero cells

412

at a 1:1 ratio. The cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 hours and luciferase activity was

413

measured using a ONE-Glo™ luciferase assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s

414

instructions.

Sequence, data, and statistical analysis

417

The amino acid multiple sequence alignment in Fig. 3a was generated using the CLUSTAL Omega

418

multiple sequence alignment tool from NCBI. FlowJo (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was

419

used for analyzing flow cytometry data and Graphpad Prism version 7.0e was used for graph

420

generation and statistical analysis. Asterisks indicate statistical significance.
