SUMMARY

20

Viruses deploy an array of genetically encoded strategies to coopt host machinery and support viral

21

replicative cycles. Molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral and endogenous

22

host proteins, allow viruses to harness or disrupt cellular functions including nucleic acid metabolism and

23

modulation of immune responses. Here, we use protein structure similarity to scan for virally encoded

24

structure mimics across thousands of catalogued viruses and hosts spanning broad ecological niches and

25

taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey identified

26

over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry, the vast majority of which (>70%) cannot be discerned

27

through protein sequence. The results point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by

28

viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome.

29

Interrogation of proteins mimicked by human-infecting viruses points to broad diversification of cellular

30

pathways targeted via structural mimicry, identifies biological processes that may underly autoimmune

31

disorders, and reveals virally encoded mimics that may be leveraged to engineer synthetic metabolic circuits

32

or may serve as targets for therapeutics. Moreover, the manner and degree to which viruses exploit

33

molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type, with ssRNA viruses circumventing

34

limitations of their small genomes by mimicking human proteins to a greater extent than their large dsDNA

35

counterparts. Finally, we identified over 140 cellular proteins that are mimicked by CoV, providing clues

36

about cellular processes driving the pathogenesis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

39

Viruses deploy an array of genetically encoded strategies to coopt host machinery and support viral

40

replicative cycles. Among the strategies, protein-protein interactions, mediated by promiscuous,

41

multifunctional viral proteins are widely documented. Targeted discovery tools, focused largely on viruses

42

of public-health importance, have experimentally mapped thousands of virus-host protein complexes and

43

structure-informed prediction algorithms have allowed discovery of such interactions across all fully

44

sequenced human infecting viruses1. Molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral

45

and endogenous host proteins, allow viruses to harness or disrupt cellular functions including nucleic acid

46

metabolism and modulation of immune responses. Yet, while examples of this latter strategy pepper the

47

literature2-4, most have focused on human infecting viruses5,6 and a systematic analysis of pathogen-encoded

48

molecular mimics has not been performed.

49
50

The vast genomic landscape occupied by viruses hampers the discovery of evolutionary relationships

51

between viral proteins and their hosts. As is well known however, since 3-dimensional (3D) protein

52

structure is much better conserved than sequence, structural information can be used to interrogate

53

evolutionary relationships1,7 as well as uncover virus-encoded structural mimics that cannot be detected by

54

sequence relationships (see Methods). Here, we use protein structure similarity to identify virally encoded

55

mimics of host proteomes. Briefly, we first employ sequence-based methods to identify proteins that have

56

similar structures to queried viral proteins and then use structural alignment to find “structural neighbors”

57

of viral proteins (Figure 1a). We refer to the corresponding viral proteins as mimics of their host-encoded

58

neighbors. We applied the approach to a set of 337,493 viral proteins representing 7,486 viruses across a

59

broad host taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey

60

identified over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry, the vast majority of which (>70%) cannot be

61

discerned through protein sequence alone (see below). Our results point to molecular mimicry as a

62

pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus

63

is dictated, at least in part, by the host proteome.

64
65

We further observe that the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by

66

genome size and nucleic acid type. For example, while human-infecting and arthropod-infecting viruses

67

occupy a structure space most similar to their host proteome, arboviruses, which are transmitted to humans

68

by insect vectors, encode promiscuous proteins that mimic both human and insect proteins. In addition, we

69

find that, relative to their proteome size, ssRNA viruses, including coronaviruses (CoV), have circumvented

70

the limitations of their small genomes by mimicking human proteins to a greater extent than their large

71

dsDNA counterparts like Pox- and Herpes-viruses. Interrogation of proteins mimicked by human-infecting

72

viruses points to broad diversification of cellular pathways targeted via structural mimicry, identifies

73

biological processes that may underly autoimmune disorders, and reveals virally encoded mimics that may

74

be leveraged to engineer synthetic metabolic circuits or may serve as targets for therapeutics. Finally, we

75

identified over 140 cellular proteins (including members of the complement activation pathway and critical

76

regulators of innate and adaptive immunity) that are mimicked by CoV, providing clues about the cellular

77

processes underlying the pathogenesis driving the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Results

80

Mining the virome-wide structure space to identify host proteins mimicked by viruses

81

In order to identify mimicry relationships, we implemented the strategy summarized in Figure 1a.

82

Sequence-based searches (see Methods) of 337,493 viral proteins (269,077 unique sequences) against the

83

PDB identified structural templates for 92,868 (34.5%), with large disparities in coverage: structural

84

templates were identified for 64.7% of the proteins from human-infecting viruses while the coverage for

85

non-vertebrate-infecting viruses ranged from 31% to 38% (Figure S1a; Table S2). As shown in Figure S1b,

86

structural templates for vertebrate and human infecting viruses came primarily from other viruses while,

87

for example, bacterial proteins provided most of the templates for bacteria-infecting viruses. Most of the

88

templates for invertebrate-infecting viruses came from vertebrate and bacterial proteins, likely reflecting

89

the limited structural coverage of non-vertebrate viruses and invertebrate hosts in the PDB. Ska was used

90

To measure structure similarity between protein structures, we utilized Ska, an extensively utilized and

91

validated tool for inference of structure-based functional relationships even in the absence of detectable

92

sequence similarity1,8-13. In addition to Ska, we employed a conservative global structural similarity criteria

93

(Structural Alignment Score14-16, SAS < 2.5Å) to infer structural mimics and minimize biases imposed by

94

local structural similarities (see Methods). As shown in Figure S2, this approach enables rediscovery of

95

known virus encoded protein structure mimics. Structural alignment of the 92,868 templates with PDB

96

proteins identified 6,083,167 mimicry relationships, involving 88,715 viral proteins and 26,542 host protein

97

structures

98

https://github.com/gorkaLasso/VirusHost_mimicry). The vast majority of these mimicry relationships

99

(72.2%) could not be retrieved through sequence similarity alone based on the requirement that no e-value

obtained from any one or three sequence-based methods was greater than 1x10-6 (see Methods).

101
102

Host range and taxonomic division drives viral protein structure space and mimicry

103

Taxonomic enrichment analysis (Figure 1b-c) reveals a clear correlation between the extent of virus

104

structural mimicry and the identity of the host. Since their proteomes are well represented in the PDB, we

105

first focused on the proteomes of E. coli-infecting phages, their natural host E. coli, the budding yeast

106

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and human. Significant structure similarity is only observed between E. coli-

107

infecting phages and their natural host (Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 1c, with the exception of

108

invertebrate infecting viruses which constitute a special case (see below), a broader analysis across all 7,486

109

catalogued viruses and 38,363 proteins from 4,045 putative hosts demonstrates that every virus group

110

exhibits significant protein structural similarity to the taxonomic division of their hosts. In addition, viruses

111

exhibit structural similarity to proteomes in other taxonomic divisions that are close in evolutionary distance

112

to the host taxonomic division, and reduced structural similarity to more distant taxonomic divisions (e.g.

113

the structural space of human-infecting viruses are enriched for human, vertebrates and invertebrate

114

proteins but not bacteria or plant proteins, Figure 1c). Such similarities are reflected in evolutionary

115

relationships between different taxonomic divisions. For instance, accumulating evidence describes some

116

compartments of the phytosphere as environmental host spots for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that

117

facilitate genetic exchange between plants and bacteria17, underscoring the significant structural

118

relationship between plant and fungi-infecting viruses and phages (Figure 1c). Moreover, in agreement with

119

the results obtained for the broader virus categories, we found the protein structure space of human-

120

infecting viruses to be enriched with structures found in human and non-human vertebrate proteomes

121

(Figure 1c) – pointing to a possible path through which zoonotic infections may jump from animal

122

reservoirs to cause human disease.

123
124

Unlike viruses of bacteria and vertebrates, we do not observe significant structural similarity between

125

proteomes of invertebrate-infecting viruses and their invertebrate hosts – perhaps owing to the fact that

126

invertebrates account for the taxonomic group with the lowest structural coverage in the PDB (containing

127

just 2,687 unique invertebrate proteins). To bridge this knowledge gap, we modeled the proteome of the

128

mosquito Ae. Aegypti (see Methods) and compared the protein structure space of mosquito with each group

129

of viruses. As shown in Figure 1d, we find that mosquito-infecting viruses occupy a significantly larger

130

mosquito structural space than viruses that infect hosts in other taxonomic divisions. Moreover, we observe

131

that mosquito-borne arboviruses, human-infecting viruses that use mosquitoes as vectors, engage a larger

132

space of mosquito protein mimics than human-infecting viruses that do not use mosquitoes as vectors

133

(Pvalue 2.3x10-3; Figure 1d). Together, these data further highlight the evolutionary pressures imposed on

134

viruses to utilize a protein structure space defined by their host’s range.

135
136

Diversification of mimicry strategies among human-infecting viruses

137

Figure 2a displays the number of human structural mimics for different groups of viruses. A number of

138

viral families, including Hepadnaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Retroviridae,

139

Arenaviridae and Polyomaviridae, utilize structural mimicry far less than others. On the other hand,

140

poxviruses and herpesviruses, large dsDNA viruses that are less constrained by genome size (Figure 2b)

141

and more likely to retain horizontally transferred genes3,5, encode many human protein structure mimics

142

(Figure 2a). In contrast, relative to their proteome size, small RNA viruses, which are constrained by

143

genome size, display enhanced structural promiscuity, with a larger number of human protein mimics per

144

residue (Figure 2c). So, while viruses constrained by genome size may be restricted in their ability to expand

145

their genomes through horizontal gene transfer, they have circumvented this limitation by encoding

146

multifunctional proteins that mimic domains across multiple host proteins. These observations underscore

147

the role of structural mimicry in evolving expanded molecular functionality in size constrained genomes.

148
149

Pathways targeted by viral mimicry

150

Human-infecting DNA encoded viruses:

151

The critical nature of virus-host PPIs in engaging host molecular machinery to fulfill viral life cycles has

152

led to convergence of evolutionarily unrelated viruses around key cellular pathways (e.g. human-infecting

153

DNA, RNA and retro-transcribing viruses converge, via different sets of PPIs, on multiple cellular

154

metabolic pathways)1. In contrast, as shown in Figure 2d and Table S3, structurally mimicked proteins

5

155

revealed little such convergence. Moreover, when convergence was observed, it often involved 2 or 3 viral

156

families belonging to the same Baltimore classification. For example, owing to their large genomes and in

157

agreement with their propensity to acquire host genes through HGT, Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae and

158

Poxviridae, families of dsDNA viruses are enriched for the largest number of mimicked biological

159

pathways, 113, 38 and 35 respectively (Figure 2d and Table S3). Yet, while these viruses harbor a large

160

number of human protein mimics, they do not mimic cellular components of RNA and DNA metabolism –

161

likely reflecting the fact that they encode polymerases (as is the case of Poxviridae) and/or integrate into

162

the cellular genome and are therefore bystander participants in cellular DNA replication.

163
164

We observe an enrichment of cytokine related pathways in poxvirus- and herpesvirus-mimicked proteins,

165

and chemokine-related pathways in proteins mimicked by herpesviruses (Table S3 and Figure 2d). Indeed,

166

poxviruses and herpesviruses have evolved a repertoire of immune evasion strategies by acquiring

167

immunomodulatory host genes through genetic recombination (often involving cytokines and cytokine

168

receptors). Undetectable sequence similarity with the host has complicated past attempts to identification

169

virus-host relationships6,18. However, while many of the relationships between herpesvirus and chemokine

170

or chemokine receptors can be discerned from sequence, we have expanded the list of known mimics to

171

include 61 new herpesviral structure mimics not discernible from sequence alone (Figure 2d; complete list

172

of mimics is available at https://github.com/gorkaLasso/VirusHost_mimicry). For example, as shown in

173

Figure 2d, we observed that US27D protein from Cercopithecine betaherpesvirus 5, a cytomegalovirus,

174

mimics human CXCR4 (sequence identity: 10.4%), a chemokine receptor that regulates T-cell

175

inflammatory programs and can serve as a co-receptor for HIV19. It is unclear if the structural mimics

176

encoded by DNA viruses that we have identified are a result of sequence divergence of products acquired

177

by HGT or through convergent evolution. Yet, they highlight the pervasive use of mimicry by DNA viruses

178

and point to novel host factors that are targeted by structural mimicry.

179
180

Human-infecting RNA encoded viruses:

181

As highlighted above, RNA viruses have circumvented limitations imposed on their small proteomes by

182

encoding multifunctional and structurally promiscuous proteins that mimic domains across multiple host

183

proteins (Figure 2c). In accordance with known phenotypes (like fibrinolysis and hemorrhagic fever)

184

associated with Dengue virus (DENV; Flaviridae) infection20,21, we find that proteins mimicked by these

185

RNA viruses are enriched for functions and pathways related to blood coagulation and the complement

186

pathway – an observation that is mirrored by PPIs mediated by proteins encoded by these viruses (we

187

previously found that PPI networks mediated by proteins of 51 of 56 flaviviruses were enriched for

188

“complement and coagulation cascades”)1. While examples of such mimicry have been identified through

6

189

sequence homology between DENV C, prM, E and NS1 proteins and human coagulation factors20,21, we

190

find similar mimicry, that cannot be discerned through sequence, employed by four other (+)ssRNA virus

191

families (168, 166, 1376 and 1293 structural relationships between coagulation factors and astroviridae,

192

coronaviruses, caliciviruses and picornaviruses, respectively; sequence identity < 20%, Table S3, data

193

available at https://github.com/gorkaLasso/VirusHost_mimicry). So, while DENV immunization or

194

exposure elicits antibodies that cross-react with multiple coagulation factor-associated pathological

195

states20,21, our observations suggest that infections with viruses belonging to these other families may also

196

result in similar imbalances in immune responses. Indeed, viruses within these families (e.g. SARS-

197

Coronaviridae, Hepatitis A-Picornaviridae and Hepatitis C-Flaviridae), are known to be associated with

198

coagulation disorders such as thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage22.

199
200

Coronaviruses

201

Knowledge of the precise regulatory programs that control the viral life cycle and mediate immune

202

pathology can provide valuable clues about disease determinants. A closer look at coronaviruses

203

underscores the level of diversification and structural promiscuity of protein mimics encoded by these

204

viruses. As highlighted in Figure 2c, relative to proteome size, positive sense single stranded RNA

205

((+)ssRNA) viruses including CoV utilize structural mimicry more so than other human-infecting viruses.

206

We identified 145 cellular proteins that are mimicked by three or more coronaviruses (data available at

207

https://github.com/gorkaLasso/VirusHost_mimicry). Among these, we have identified CoV-encoded

208

structural mimics that target key regulators of immune anti-viral programs.

209
210

First, in the context of CoV infection, intracellular sensing of viral RNA through DDX58 (also known as

211

RIG-I; Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I), a pathogen recognition receptor, triggers a signaling cascade that

212

results in the production and secretion of Type I interferons (IFNa/b) 23,24. IFNa/b in turn binds to cell

213

surface receptors (IFNRs) on nearby cells and, following a signal-transduction cascade, leads to STAT1-

214

mediated (Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 1) upregulation of hundreds of IFN-

215

stimulated genes (ISGs) which govern cellular responses to infection and render cells refractory to viral

216

infection. These responses are indispensable for control of viral replication and initiation of long-term

217

immune responses 23,24. As shown in Figure 3, we find that NSP13 of CoV mimics DDX3X and RIG-I as

218

well as other helicase proteins, critical cellular components that cooperate through both direct and indirect

219

interactions to initiate immune responses to viral infection. Importantly, RIG-I ligands include ssRNAs that

220

contain a 5'-triphosphate moiety23,24 and previous biochemical characterizations have attributed multiple

221

enzymatic activities to NSP13, including hydrolysis of NTPs and dNTPs and RNA 5’-triphosphatase

222

activity25,26. So, mimicry of RIG-I may serve to reduce the amount of viral RNA that is available to be

223

sensed in infected cells. In addition, the CoV replicase complex has recently been demonstrated to interact

224

with host cell DDX proteins27,28, suggesting that coronaviruses may utilize both PPIs and structural mimicry

225

to manipulate functions of these proteins.

226
227

In addition to mimicking critical components of the cellular nucleic acid sensing machinery, we have

228

identified CoV-encoded structural mimics that target key regulators of downstream anti-viral programs

229

mediated by STAT1. As shown in Figure 3, we observe significant structural similarity between CoV NSP3

230

protein and human PARP9 and PARP14, ADP-ribosyltransferases with known cross-regulatory roles in

231

controlling STAT1-mediated signaling29. Though the precise mode of action has remained unresolved, CoV

232

ORF3, which encodes NSP3, has indeed been shown to be an antagonist of IFNa/b signaling and interferes

233

with STAT1nuclear translocation30. Our results point to structural mimicry as a molecular explanation

234

underlying these observations.

235
236

Lastly, as discussed above, we find that structural mimicry of complement components is a feature shared

237

across all coronaviruses that were part of this study (including SARS-CoV-2). The complement system is

238

a critical regulator of immune responses to microbial threats, but when dysregulated by age-related effects

239

or excessive acute and chronic tissue damage, complement activation can contribute to pathologies

240

mediated by inflammation. Our data implicates virally encoded structural mimics that may contribute to

241

SARS-(Coronaviridae) associated coagulation disorders like thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and

242

hemorrhage22 – disease outcomes shared with Hepatitis A (Picornaviridae) and Hepatitis C (Flaviridae)

243

infections (which also encode coagulation and complement cascade mimics). In addition, while the age-

244

related differences in susceptibility to CoV (including SARS-CoV-2) are likely a consequence of multiple

245

underlying variables, one possibility is that prior exposure to coronavirus may potentiate complement-

246

mediated responses to subsequent coronavirus infections. Moreover, a corollary of these observations is

247

that complement-associated syndromes (including complement deficiencies or hyper-activation phenotypes

248

like those associated with macular degeneration) may impact clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2

249

infection. Indeed, in the as part of a separate retrospective clinical study, we have demonstrated that history

250

of macular degeneration, is a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected

251

patients – effects that could not be explained by age or sex31.

252
253

DISCUSSION

254

The mimicry of host protein structures is a strategy used by viruses to harness or disrupt host cellular

255

functions2-6. Structural mimicry can occur at the level of entire protein domains or in the form of “interface

256

mimicry”, where the structure of host protein residues involved in protein-protein interactions is mimicked

257

on the surface of a viral protein32-34. High throughput experimental methods, focused largely on viruses of

258

public-health importance, have experimentally mapped thousands of virus-host protein complexes while

259

structure-based computational tools based on interface mimicry have reported notable successes in the

260

prediction of protein-protein interactions, PPIs32-34. Recently we reported a structure-informed prediction

261

algorithm, P-HIPSTer, that exploits domain level similarity and interface properties to predict virus/host

262

PPIs across all fully sequenced human infecting viruses1. Studies such as these have revealed valuable

263

information about the molecular mechanisms that underlie viral infection. Yet, while most of these

264

experimental and computational studies have focused on PPIs, a systematic analysis of viral mimicry of

265

host proteins has not been reported. Here, rather than considering PPIs, we explore the extent to which viral

266

mimicry of host proteins is a common phenomenon and ask whether the “structure space” occupied by a

267

particular virus is related to that of the host it infects. Moreover, by analyzing the host proteins that are

268

mimicked we are able to gain functional insights about infection mechanisms that are complementary to

269

those gained by predicting PPIs.

270
271

Structure enables identification of mimics between viral and host proteins that cannot be observed from

272

sequence alone. Mimicry relationships have been detected through sequence similarity and linear motif co-

273

occurrence. We bypass limitations of sequence-based approaches by leveraging 3D protein structure to

274

identify virally encoded proteins with significant structural similarity to host proteins. Although examples

275

of pathogen-encoded protein mimicry have been reported in the literature, to our knowledge, this is the first

276

comprehensive and systematic analysis of molecular mimicry across the earth’s virome – spanning 337,493

277

viral proteins from 7,486 viruses (bacteria, plant-fungi, invertebrate and vertebrate-infecting viruses) and

278

38,363 proteins from 4,045 putative hosts.

279
280

Our pipeline uses a conservative global structural similarity criteria (Structural Alignment Score, SAS <

281

2.5Å) to infer structural mimics14-16. Consequently, our approach does not consider local structural

282

similarities defined by small protein regions and linear motifs (frequently found in disordered regions)4,32.

283

Importantly, structural mimicry does not necessarily imply functional mimicry. Furthermore, some of the

284

mimics that we identify may represent spurious structural relationships that stem from underlying functional

285

class of a give pair of proteins (virus and host encoded proteases). Future experimental and functional

286

interrogation will be necessary to demonstrate functional implications for the molecular mimics discovered

287

as part of this work. Nevertheless, the results illustrate the ability of protein structure-based analysis to infer

288

structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between viruses and their hosts.

290

Our results demonstrate that regardless of genome size, replicative cycle, or ecological niche, and the

291

evolutionary pressures imposed on viruses is reflected in the structure space they occupy and illustrate that

292

mimicry may both constrain and enable host range. Of note, while structural similarity between viral and

293

host proteins serves as a scaffold enabling viral proteins to coopt host pathways, amino acid identities at

294

key functional sites will ultimately shape the extent to which host pathways can be intervened. Our

295

observations offer a unique first step to investigating the role of amino acid variability at mimicked

296

functional sites that might help explain differences in phenotypic outcome associated with viral infections.

297
298

Finally, the repertoire of structural mimics we discover opens new opportunities to identify potential

299

mechanisms underlying autoimmune disorders of viral origin and new protein-based immune-modulatory

300

therapeutics. For example, leveraging mimicry relationships between coronaviruses and human proteins

301

informs about cellular targets and signaling cascades that are tuned during infection. Such knowledge can

302

provide important clues about pathways that mediate pathology associated with infection and may point the

303

way for designer therapeutics directed at these pathways. In the short-term, and as highlighted by recent

304

discovery of SARS-CoV-2 risk factors31, information about virus-encoded structural mimics can help refine

305

large-scale clinical studies and reveal determinants of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome

306

associated with human infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

319

Viral dataset assembly

320

We compiled a dataset of 7,486 viruses, represented by a total of 337,493 viral protein amino acid sequences

321

together with annotations of their corresponding hosts, from virus-hostDB as of October, 201635. Viruses

322

were classified according to the taxonomic divisions of their corresponding host based on NCBI taxonomic

323

divisions36 (Table S1).

325

Structural neighbor search

326

The 337,493 viral protein amino acid sequences were reduced to 269,077 non-redundant sequences filtered

327

at 100% sequence identity with Cd-hit37. Sequence-based methods were then used to identify

328

experimentally determined protein structures that, based on their sequence relationship to the viral protein,

329

are expected to have similar structures (referred to here as “structural templates” - Figure 1a). First, viral

330

proteins were parsed into domains using CD-search38. Next, to identify structural templates, full sequences

331

and parsed domains were queried against the PDB39. Sequence homology search was performed in three

332

steps, where each step is run only if the preceding step fails to report a structural template with a

333

conservative E-value < 1x10-12: i) Blast-based search 40; ii) HHblits-based search41 and; iii) the third step

334

runs five iterations of PSI-Blast. The pipeline reports the best structural template mapping to non-

335

overlapping sequence segments for each query protein. When multiple structural templates map to the same

336

segment in a query protein, only the structural template(s) with the lowest E-value are reported. The set of

337

structural templates, describing the structural space of viral proteins, is further refined in order to minimize

338

the number of redundant templates. To this end, structural templates derived from the same pdb chain and

339

with their start and end positions within 15 residues are clustered together, using the longest structural

340

template as the cluster representative. Finally, the set of structural templates is searched against the PDB

341

database with Ska12,13 using a structural alignment score (SAS) < 2.5Å as a cut-off to identify structurally

342

similar proteins15. The ska algorithm focuses on alignment of secondary structure elements and uses only

343

C-alpha coordinates of residues. Hence any differences in loop or side-chain conformations that might be

344

expected because of differences in resolution would have little to no effect on a ska alignment.

345
346

Sequence homology assessment between viral proteins and their corresponding structural neighbors

347

Sequence homology among a pair of structurally similar proteins was considered significant when neither

348

a Blast, HHBlits or PSI-Blast alignment yielded an E-value < 1x10-6. In addition, for figures 2 and 3,

349

sequence identities for pairs of structurally similar proteins, were computed using the Needleman-Wunsch

350

algorithm implemented in the EMBOSS package (considering only the corresponding protein segments

351

sharing structural similarity)42.

352
353

Calculating overlap between structural space of a virus and proteins in a given taxonomic division

354

Taxonomic division enrichment (Figures 1b-c) was computed with a hypergeometric test that describes the

355

significance of having k structural neighbors belonging to a particular taxonomic division (out of n total

356

structural neighbors for a group of viruses) given the entire set of structurally solved proteins in the PDB

357

of size N that contains K proteins from the same taxonomic division43. To minimize experimental bias of

358

multiple PDB entries for the same protein, structurally solved proteins were mapped to their Uniprot

359

accession codes44 using SIFTS mapping45.

361

Protein modeling and structural neighbor search for Aedes aegypti proteome

362

Our validated, inhouse modeling pipeline1,8 was used to model the 16,652 protein sequences (obtained from

363

the Uniprot database44) in the Aedes aegypti proteome. Three-dimensional models for full-length proteins

364

and protein domains, as defined by the Conserved Domain Database38, were either taken directly from the

365

PDB39 or built by homology modeling as described previously8,11. Protein structure models were built using

366

NEST12,46. Structural neighbor search was run on the set of modeled mosquito proteins using Ska12,13 and a

367

structural alignment score (SAS) < 2.5Å was used as a cut-off to identify structurally similar proteins15.

368

The modeling and structural neighbor search pipeline reported structural neighbors for 10,895 (65%)

369

mosquito proteins.

370
371

Identifying the mosquito structural neighbor space for each virus in the dataset.

372

The unique set of mosquito structural neighbors was computed for across all viruses. Structural

373

relationships between viral and mosquito proteins was inferred by identifying common structural neighbors

374

shared between a given viral and mosquito protein pair. Poorly annotated viruses with less than 4 annotated

375

viral proteins were discarded. Invertebrate-infecting viruses were further sub-classified into i) invertebrate-

376

infecting viruses (including mosquito infecting viruses); ii) viruses infecting both human and mosquitoes

377

and; iii) viruses infecting mosquitoes but not humans. We applied the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test

378

to compare the size of the mosquito structural neighbor space per virus (normalized by the total number of

379

annotated viral proteins in each virus) between different groups of viruses (Figure 1c), and outliers were

380

removed with the Rout method (Q = 1%) implemented in Prism47.

381
382

Human protein structural neighbors of human-infecting viral families

383

To estimate the number of human protein structural neighbors per virus, viruses with 4 or more annotated

384

proteins with structural template for at least 30% of the viral proteins were considered (Figure 2a, 2c). The

385

total number of human structural neighbors per virus was corrected by the corresponding structural

386

coverage (e.g. for a virus where 70% of its proteins have a structural template and shows structural

387

similarity to 30 human proteins, the corrected number of human structural neighbors will be 30 / 0.7 = 42.9,

388

Figure 1a). Viruses were grouped into viral families and families with less than 5 viruses were not plotted.

389

In order to plot the number of human structural neighbors per residue for a given family of human infecting

390

viruses (Figure 2c), we normalized the total number of human mimics per virus (Figure 2a) by the

391

corresponding proteome size (Figure 2b).

Functional enrichment analysis

Enrichment of biological ontologies (molecular function, biological pathways and diseases) was determined

396

Bonferroni corrected p-value < 0.01 was used to identify enriched biological ontologies. Viral families and
