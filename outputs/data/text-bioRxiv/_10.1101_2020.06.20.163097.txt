ABSTRACT

51

SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors,

52

ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person

53

transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive

54

tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary,

55

fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2

56

or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast.

57

Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed

58

the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin

59

L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest

60

that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to

61

infection by SARS-CoV2. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is unlikely to contribute to

62

pregnancy-related adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, transmission of COVID-19

63

through breast milk, oogenesis and female fertility.

There has been significant concern regarding fertility and reproductive outcomes during the

INTRODUCTION

66

The coronavirus disease 2019, also commonly known as COVID-19 is caused by severe acute

67

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). SARS-CoV2 is a single-stranded positive

68

sense RNA virus first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019 (1, 2). Since then, it has spread

69

worldwide, becoming a global pandemic, infecting nearly 3.58 million people worldwide and

70

resulting in 247,503 deaths (3). The severity of SARS-CoV2 varies as infected individuals can

71

be either asymptomatic or present mild to severe symptoms. Some of the most common

72

symptoms presented among the individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 include fever, cough,

73

pneumonia, occasional diarrhea, muscle pain, and new loss of sense of smell or taste (4).

74

SARS-CoV2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cells

75

through spike (S) protein on the surface of the virus (2, 5). In addition to ACE2, entry of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163097; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

76

virus into the host cell is also mediated by proteases TMPRSS2 (5). In the absence of

77

TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV2 is known to use cathepsins, CTSB and CTSL as an alternate to enter

78

the host cells (5). These proteases are required for the priming of the S protein after it binds

79

to the ACE2 receptor for its entry into the host cell (5, 6).

80

Recent analyses of existing single-cell sequencing datasets showed that the SARS-CoV2

81

receptor, ACE2 is expressed in various cell types of organs of the respiratory tract, with

82

relatively high expression in goblet cells and ciliated cells of nasal epithelium and club cells in

83

the lung (7). In addition to respiratory tract, additional single cell sequencing analyses of

84

cornea, ileum, colon, heart, and gallbladder besides the respiratory tract identified cells that

85

are susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection (7). These findings may explain cardiovascular

86

inflammation, conjunctivitis and diarrhea as well as other symptoms among individuals

87

infected with SARS-CoV2.

88

One of the major clinical concerns is the effect of SARS-CoV2 on pregnancy and fertility.

89

Reports with data from a limited number of pregnant women suggest that SARS-CoV2 is

90

responsible for miscarriages, preterm birth, stillbirth, and fetal growth restrictions due to

91

placental abnormalities (8, 9). However, the susceptibility of female reproductive organs to

92

SARS-CoV2 is poorly understood.

93

We investigated the cell-specific presence of ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptor expression in the

94

female reproductive organs as a surrogate for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. We

95

examined the myometrium, uterus, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast single-cell RNA

96

sequencing datasets for cell specific expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, ACE2. Our study

97

gave us critical insights into the expression of SARS-CoV2 receptor and proteases TMPRSS2,

98

CTSB/L in the female reproductive tract. Our findings suggest that ovary, fallopian tube,

99

uterus, myometrium, and breast are unlikely to be direct targets for SARS-CoV2 entry.

103

The published datasets can be found at: fallopian tube (GSE139079), breast (NCBI

104

GSE113197), ovary (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-8381/), and

105

uterus (GSE134355). We retained the cell clustering the same as described in the respective

106

manuscripts except for the uterus. For the uterus dataset, we filtered out cells expressing more

107

than 20% mitochondrial genes and used the standard Seurat pipeline to obtain the cell

108

clusters.

109

Myometrium tissue collection and preparation of the single-cell suspension

110

Normal myometrium was collected from the patients undergoing hysterectomy with informed

111

consent. Tissues were collected under the UCSF Biospecimen Resources (BIOS) program

112

approved by the institutional review board, ethics approval, 17-22669.

113

Fresh tissue samples were collected, stored in ice-cold HBSS, and transported to the lab. The

114

myometrium was cut into 3-4 mm pieces. These pieces were then added to the 3-4 ml of

115

digestion media containing 0.1 mg/ml liberase (Roche, 501003280), 100 U/ml DNase I

116

(Sigma, D4527), and 25 U/ml dispase (Sigma, D4818) in DMEM (Life Technologies,

117

12634010) per gm of the tissue, and mechanically dissociated using the gentle MACS

118

dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech) for 30 mins at 37°C to prepare the single-cell suspension. The

119

cell suspension was then pipetted up and down with 25 ml,10 ml, and 5 ml pipette for 1 minute

120

each and then filtered through 70 m filter (Corning, 431751). Debris was then removed from

121

the cell suspension using the debris removal solution (Miltenyi Biotech, 130-109-398) as per

122

the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were then incubated with RBC lysis buffer

123

(Thermofisher Scientific, 00-4333-57) for 5 mins on ice to remove the red blood cells. The

124

cells were then resuspended in the 0.4% ultrapure BSA (Thermofisher Scientific, AM2616) in

125

PBS and passed through the 70-m cell strainer (Bel-Art, H13680-0070) to obtain the single-

126

cell suspension.

127

Single-cell RNA sequencing library preparation

128

Single cells were processed through 10X Chromium system (10X Genomics, USA) using the

129

single-cell 5’ library and the gel bead kit (10X Genomics, PN-1000006), and the Chromium

130

single cell chip kit (10X Genomics, PN-1000151) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The

131

cells were partitioned into barcoded gel bead‐in‐emulsions reverse transcription was

132

performed on individual droplets. cDNA libraries were then sequenced using an Illumina Hi-

133

Seq 2500/NOVA (Illumina).

134

Single-cell RNA-seq data preprocessing and analysis for myometrium dataset

135

FASTQ files were analyzed using Cellranger (version 3.1; 10x Genomics). Raw count cell by

136

transcript matrices were imported into R and Seurat (version 3.0) and used for further analysis.

137

For quality control, cells having fewer than 200 reads, greater than 2500 reads, or more than

138

seven percent mitochondrial gene expression were removed. The “sctransform” function was

139

utilized to integrate the Seurat object from the eight tissue samples. Any cells with more than

140

one percent expression of hemoglobin genes HBA2, HBA1, and HBB were removed. The raw

141

transcripts were normalized in each cell to transcripts per 10,000 UMI to remove the batch

142

effects and log2 transformed. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was

143

used for dimensionality reduction and clustering the cells.

RESULTS

146

Expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the ovary

147

Normal ovarian function is essential for proper oogenesis and fertility. We investigated the

148

presence of the ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL in the human ovary cell types derived

149

from single-cell sequencing (10). Data processing and cluster annotation were performed as

150

previously described (10) (Fig. 1A, B). We found that ACE2 was expressed at a very low level

151

in less than 5% of stroma and perivascular cells of the ovarian cortex. We did not observe the

152

expression of TMPRSS2 in any of the eight distinct cell types in the ovary (Fig. 1C, D). CTSB

153

and CTSL were found to be expressed in all eight ovarian cell types (Fig. 1C, D). However,

154

we did not observe any cells in the ovary co-expressing ACE2/ CTSB or ACE2/CTSL (Fig.

155

1D). Since ACE2 requires the co-expression of protease TMPRSS2 or CTSB/L to facilitate its

156

entry into the host cell by priming the S protein on its surface, our data suggest that SARS-

157

CoV2 is unlikely to infect the ovarian cells and unlikely to affect oogenesis.

158
159

Expression of ACE2 and proteases TMPRSS2, CTSB/L in the fallopian tube

160

The fallopian tube is responsible for transporting the oocyte or fertilized egg to the uterus for

161

implantation. Inflammation and blockage of the fallopian tube can lead to infertility in women.

162

We therefore analyzed SARS-CoV2 receptors expression in different cell types of the fallopian

163

tube. We analyzed the previously published single-cell dataset from the normal fallopian tube

164

(11). We performed the cluster annotation and filtering of the low-quality cells exactly as

165

previously described (11). Cell clusters and cluster annotations are shown in Fig. 2A, B. Our

166

analysis of the fallopian tube dataset revealed ACE2 expression in less than 5% ciliated cells,

167

secretory cells, and leukocytes. In contrast, proteases TMPRSS2 and CTSL/B showed varying

168

expression levels in all cell types of oviduct. We did not detect expression of CTSL in any cell

169

type of fallopian tube (Fig. 2C, D). We did not observe any fallopian tube cells co-expressing

170

ACE2 with either of TMPRSS2 or CTSB. We know that the ciliated cells in the fallopian tube

171

are essential for the movement of oocyte and sperm through the lumen, while secretory cells

172

secrete nutrient-rich fluid for the egg and sperm to find each other (12-14). Together, this data

173

suggests that SARS-CoV2 infection is unlikely to affect early fertilization events.

174
175

Myometrium expression of SARS-CoV2 receptors

176

We performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of the normal myometrium collected from the

177

women undergoing hysterectomy. Seurat analysis of 11,235 high-quality cells from the

178

myometrium revealed the presence of 13 distinct cell populations (Fig. 3A). The

179

subpopulations included known cell types: smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, natural killer (NK)

180

cells, T cells, myeloid cells, and endothelial cells (Fig. 3B). These 13 subpopulations were

181

annotated by performing the differential gene expression analysis supported by the known

182

markers such as ACTA2, CNN1 for smooth muscle, VWF and PECAM for endothelial cells,

183

DCN and LUM for fibroblasts, CD3D for T cells, GNLY and NKG7 for NK cells, PROX1 for

184

lymphatic endothelial cells and CD14, and S100A8 for myeloid cells (S.Fig. 1). We observed

185

low expression of ACE2 in approximately 1% of the fibroblast cells in the myometrium. We did

186

not observe expression of TMPRSS2 in any of the cell types in normal myometrium (Fig.

187

3C,D). We also investigated the presence of cathepsins in these cell types. It has been

188

previously reported that CTSB and CTSL are potentially involved in facilitating the entry of the

189

SARS-CoV2 into the cell in the absence of TMPRSS2 (5). We discovered that myeloid cells,

190

endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, T-cells, NK cells, and fibroblast cell populations

191

in the myometrium express CTSB and CTSL (Fig. 3C, D). Interestingly, we did not find co-

192

expression of either CTSB or CTSL with ACE2 (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that SARS-

193

CoV2 is unlikely to infect the smooth muscle cells in the myometrium, suggesting that COVID-

194

19 infection is unlikely to cause myometrial inflammation and potentially preterm birth.

195
196

Cell-specific expression of SARS-CoV2 receptors in uterus

197

Once the egg is fertilized, the uterus plays a critical role in the implantation and maintenance

198

of pregnancy. Our data in the myometrium did not indicate co-expression for genes necessary

199

for SARS-CoV2 infection. To determine if SARS-CoV2 might affect the uterine function, we

200

wanted to investigate the expression of SARS-CoV2 receptor in the whole uterus. Therefore,

201

we investigated the co-expression of ACE2 with TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L from single-cell

202

sequencing of the whole uterus (15). Analysis of uterine dataset revealed presence of 10

203

clusters including smooth muscle cells, stromal cells, luminal epithelium, endothelial cells,

204

fibroblasts, and macrophages (Fig. 4A, B). Expression analysis of TMRSS2 revealed the

205

absence of TMPRSS2 RNA in all cell types of the uterus. We found very low expression of

206

ACE2 in approximately 5% of the stromal cells and 1% endothelial cells (Fig. 4C, D). We also

207

assessed the expression of CTSB/L in the uterus dataset and found that both CTSB/L are

208

expressed in all cell types of the uterus (Fig. 4C, D). However, none of these cell types co-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.163097; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

8
209

expressed ACE2 with either CTSL or CTSB (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that it is unlikely

210

that uterus is susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection in humans.

211
212

Cell-specific expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in breast epithelium

213

We also wanted to investigate if the SARS-CoV2 can infect the mammary gland epithelium

214

cells and potentially be transmitted to the neonates through the breast milk. We investigated

215

the presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSBL/B within the single-cell sequencing dataset

216

from the primary human breast epithelial cells (16). These samples were collected from

217

patients undergoing reduction mammoplasties. UMAP) and cell cluster annotations are shown

218

in Fig 5A and B. We found that ACE2 was expressed in approximately 5% of luminal

219

epithelium and myofibroblasts in breast epithelium (Fig. 5C, D). TMPRSS2 was expressed at

220

very low levels in the luminal epithelium, basal and myofibroblast cells (Fig. 5C, D). Both CTSB

221

and CTSL were expressed all cell types of the breast epithelium (Fig. 5C, D). However, we

222

did not find any cells in the breast epithelium co-expressing ACE2 and either of the proteases

223

(Fig. 5D). As the co-expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 or ACE2/ CTSB/L is important for the

224

entry of the virus into the cell, these findings indicate that there is no risk of vertical

225

transmission of SARS-CoV2 in neonates through breastfeeding by infected mother as breast

226

is unlikely to be infected by SARS-CoV2.

227
228

DISCUSSION

229

With the SARS-CoV2 infection affecting multiple organs, there are increasing concerns about

230

the effect of SARS-CoV2 on pregnancy and fertility (17). There is very limited and conflicting

231

data on how COVID-19 affects pregnancy and transmission of SARS-CoV2 from mother to

232

the neonate (9). In this study, we analyzed single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, ovary,

233

fallopian tube, and breast to better understand the susceptibility of different cell types in the

234

female reproductive tract to infection by SARS-CoV2.

235

Studies with limited patient numbers have shown that the women infected with SARS-CoV2

236

have a higher incidence of premature delivery, miscarriage, and intrauterine growth restriction

237

(9). Total reports from 32 patients have suggested that 47% of women affected by COVID-19

238

had preterm deliveries (9). However, the aforementioned studies are small and there is no

239

convincing evidence on whether the preterm births were directly due to SARS-CoV2 infection

240

of the reproductive tract, secondary effects of systemic inflammation, or mechanisms

241

unrelated to SARS-CoV2. Our data in this study revealed very low expression of ACE2 in

242

uterine stromal cells and endothelial cells. We did not detect expression of TMPRSS2 in any

243

of the uterine cell. However, CTSB and CTSL were expressed in the fibroblasts, stroma,

244

smooth muscle cells and macrophages of the uterus. SARS-CoV2 uses CTSB/L proteases

245

that act as an alternative pathway to enter the host cell in the absence of TMPRSS2 (5). Since

246

we did not find co-expression of ACE2 with any of the proteases implicated in the entry of the

247

SARS-CoV2, it seems unlikely that uterus will be affected by COVID-19. The myometrium,

248

which regulates uterine contractions and is critical in the onset of labor, did not contain cells

249

that co-expressed ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptors. Together, these results indicate that COVID-

250

19 infection is unlikely to infect myometrial cells directly. SARS-CoV2 is therefore unlikely to

251

directly contribute to abnormal uterine function which may result in implantation failure,

252

preterm birth, and early placentation.

253

We found that while ACE2 was expressed in approximately 1% of stromal cells and

254

perivascular cells, TMPRSS2 was not expressed in any of the eight ovarian cell types.

255

Furthermore, fallopian tube data showed very few ciliated cells, secretory cells, and leukocytes

256

that expressed ACE2. We did not find any cells co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 or

257

CTSB/L in either ovary or fallopian tube. Together these results suggest that SARS-CoV2 is

258

unlikely to affect female fertility. A recent study analyzing the previously published testes

259

single-cell sequencing dataset identified ACE2 in spermatogonia stem cells, Leydig cells, and

260

mast cells. However, these cells lacked co-expression of the TMPRSS2 receptor(7). These

10
261

findings together with our study suggest that the SARS-CoV2 infection is unlikely to damage

262

fertility.

263

Recent studies using the already published placental single-cell sequencing datasets have

264

shown that syncytiotrophoblast cells, villous cytotrophoblast cells, decidual perivascular cells,

265

decidual stromal cells in placenta express ACE2 in 6-14 weeks of gestation. However, these

266

investigators did not observe co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in any of the placental

267

cells at this stage (7). Interestingly, another independent study found expression of TMPRSS2

268

only in villous cytotrophoblast and epithelial glandular cells and syncytiotrophoblast cells,

269

using the same dataset (Li et al. 2020). However, they also found that very few cells co-

270

expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 only in villous cytotrophoblast cells. They did not

271

observe the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in any other cell types of the placenta (Li

272

et al. 2020). In this study, the authors also compared the SARS-CoV2 receptors at different

273

stages of placental growth and found the SARS-CoV2 receptor expression is dynamic with

274

the placental growth, with significant increase in the expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2

275

in the extravillous trophoblasts at 24 weeks of gestational age compared to the early stages.

276

The increase in the expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor at later stages of placental

277

development might explain the reports of the placental abnormalities leading to miscarriages

278

or fetal growth restriction in women infected with COVID-19 (8, 18). However, further detailed

279

investigations with large sample sizes are warranted to draw any substantial conclusions.

280

We also wanted to find out if breast cells are susceptible to the COVID-19 infection.

281

Current obstetric protocols for infected mothers in labor, call for temporary separation of

282

mother and baby to prevent SARS-CoV2 transmission. Our analysis of the mammary gland

283

dataset revealed a low expression of ACE2 in luminal epithelium and myofibroblasts cell types.

284

However, we did not find co-expression of ACE2 with TMPRSS2 or CTSB/L in any cell types

285

in the breast epithelium. These findings suggest that the virus might not be able to penetrate

286

the mammary gland cells. Therefore, the chances of transmission of the virus through

287

breastfeeding are negligible.

11
288

Together, these results suggest that major reproductive organs involved in female

289

fertility and pregnancy are not susceptible to direct SARS-CoV2 infection. These data may

290

explain low incidence of complications among pregnant women and little evidence for higher

291

infertility (17). Our analyses is limited by the current single cell sequencing data sets and

292

somewhat limited number of cell population in each individual organ. Moreover, SARS-CoV2

293

systemic infection is known to affect vasculature (19) as well as increase the risk of thrombosis

294

(20) and these abnormalities may be significantly more detrimental factors to fertility and

295

pregnancy than direct infection on the reproductive organs. Prospective studies on couples

296

that conceive are necessary to better define the true effect of SARS-CoV2 infection on fertility

297

and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
