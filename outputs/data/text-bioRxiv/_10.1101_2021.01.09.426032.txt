Abstract

44

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as

45

the infectious agent causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dramatic

46

consequences for global human health and economics. Previously, we reached clinical evaluation

47

with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory

48

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and

49

COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant

50

MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability

51

and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a

52

suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-

53

specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-

54

CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human

55

ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MVA-SARS-2-S is currently being

56

investigated in a phase I clinical trial as aspirant for developing a safe and efficacious vaccine

57

against COVID-19.

Significance Statement

61

The highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a

62

component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus

63

disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S,

64

a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation. When administered by

65

intramuscular inoculation, MVA-SARS-2-S expresses and safely delivers the full-length SARS-

66

CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing balanced SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity,

67

and protective efficacy in vaccinated mice. Substantial clinical experience has already been

68

gained with MVA vectors using homologous and heterologous prime-boost applications, including

69

the immunization of children and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, MVA-SARS-2-S

70

represents an important resource for developing further optimized COVID-19 vaccines.

Introduction

74
75

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of

76

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first emerged in late 2019 in China (1). SARS-CoV-2

77

exhibits extremely efficient human-to-human transmission, the new pathogen rapidly spread

78

worldwide, and within months caused a global pandemic, changing daily life for billions of people.

79

The COVID-19 case fatality rate of ~2-5% makes the development of countermeasures a global

80

priority. In fact, the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates is advancing at an international

81

level with unprecedented speed. About a year after the first known cases of COVID-19 we can

82

account for >50 SARS-Cov-2-specific vaccines in clinical evaluations and >10 candidate vaccines

83

already in phase III trials (2-4). Yet, we still lack information on the key immune mechanisms

84

needed for protection against COVID-19. A better understanding of the types of immune response

85

elicited upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infections has become an essential component to assess the

86

promise of various vaccination strategies (5).

87

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein serves as the most important target antigen for vaccine

88

development based on preclinical research on candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV or MERS-

89

CoV. The trimeric S glycoprotein is a prominent structure at the virion surface and essential for

90

SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. As a class I viral fusion protein, it mediates virus interaction with the cellular

91

receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and fusion with the host cell membrane, both

92

key steps in infection. Thus infection can be prevented by S-specific antibodies neutralizing the

93

virus (6-9).

94

Among the front-runner vaccines are new technologies such as messenger RNA (mRNA)-based

95

vaccines and non-replicating adenovirus vector vaccines (10). First reports from these SARS-CoV-

96

2 S-specific vaccines in phase 1/2 clinical studies show acceptable safety and promising

97

immunogenicity profiles, and by now first data from large phase 3 clinical trials show promising

98

levels of protective efficacy (4, 11-13). This is good news because efficacious vaccines will provide

99

a strategy to change SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. In addition, multiple vaccine types will

100

be advantageous to meet specific demands across different target populations. This includes the

101

possibility of using heterologous immunization strategies depending on an individual’s health

102

status, boosting capacities and the need for balanced humoral and Th1-directed cellular immune

103

responses.

104

Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus originating from

105

growth selection on chicken embryo tissue cultures, shows a characteristic replication defect in

106

mammalian cells but allows unimpaired production of heterologous proteins (14). At present, MVA

107

serves as an advanced vaccine technology platform for developing new vector vaccines against

108

infectious disease and cancer including emerging viruses (15). In response to the ongoing

109

pandemic, the MVA vector vaccine platform allows rapid generation of experimental SARS-CoV-2-

110

specific vaccines (16). Previous work from our laboratory addressed the development of an MVA

111

candidate vaccine against MERS with immunizations in animal models demonstrating the safety,

112

immunogenicity and protective efficacy of MVA-induced MERS-CoV S-antigen specific immunity

113

(17-20). Clinical safety and immunogenicity of the MVA-MERS-S candidate vaccine was

114

established in a first-in-man phase I clinical study under funding from the German Center for

115

Infection Research (DZIF) (21).

116

Here, we show that a recombinant MVA virus produces the full-length S protein of SARS CoV-2 as

117

~190-200 kDa N-glycosylated protein. Our studies confirmed cleavage of the mature full-length S

118

glycoprotein into an amino-terminal domain (S1) and a ~80-100 kDa carboxy-terminal domain (S2)

119

that is anchored to the membrane. When tested as a vaccine in BALB/c mice, recombinant MVA

120

expressing the S glycoprotein induced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and antibodies, and robustly

121

protected vaccinated animals against lung infection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Results

124
125

Design and generation of candidate MVA vector viruses. cDNA containing the entire gene

126

sequence encoding SARS-CoV-2 S (SARS-2-S) from the virus isolate Wuhan HU-1 (GenBank

127

accession no. MN908947.1) was placed under the transcriptional control of the enhanced synthetic

128

vaccinia virus early/late promoter PmH5 (22) in the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red-SARS-2-S, and

129

introduced by homologous recombination into deletion site III in the MVA genome (Fig. 1A). Clonal

130

recombinant MVA viruses expressing SARS-2-S (MVA-SARS-2-S) were isolated in repetitive

131

plaque purification using transient coproduction of the fluorescent marker protein mCherry to

132

screen for red fluorescent cell foci (17, 23). PCR analysis of viral DNA confirmed the genetic

133

integrity of the recombinant viruses demonstrating the site-specific insertion of the heterologous

134

SARS-2-S gene sequences in the MVA genome, and subsequently the proper removal of the

135

mCherry marker gene from the genome of final recombinant viruses (Fig. 1B). MVA-SARS-2-S

136

virus isolates were genetically stable and showed the expected MVA–specific genetics with regard

137

to characteristic deletions and sequence alterations in the MVA genome (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).

138

The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in the chicken embryo fibroblast cell line DF-1, but

139

not in the human cell lines HeLa, A549 or HaCat (Fig. 1C).

140

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S expressed by recombinant MVA. To determine the

141

expression pattern of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we stained MVA-SARS-2-S infected

142

Vero cells with HAtag or S-specific monoclonal antibodies and analyzed them using fluorescence

143

microscopy. A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the nine amino acid-HA-tag at the

144

carboxyl (C)-terminus of the recombinant SARS-2-S protein revealed highly specific staining in

145

permeabilized cells corresponding to the expected intracellular localization of the S protein C-

146

terminal end. A SARS-CoV-1 S-specific monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope in the external

147

domain of the S protein also allowed the specific staining of non-permeabilized MVA-SARS-2-S

148

infected Vero cells, suggesting that the SARS-2-S protein was readily translocated to the

149

cytoplasma membrane (Fig. 2A).

150

To examine the MVA-produced recombinant S glycoprotein in more detail, we prepared total

151

lysates from MVA-SARS-2-S infected CEF or Vero cells for separation by SDS-PAGE and

152

subsequent immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). The mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the

153

HAtag at the C-terminus of the recombinant SARS-2-S protein revealed two prominent protein

154

bands that migrated with molecular masses of approximately 190 kDa and 90-100 kDa (Fig 2B).

155

As in the SDS-PAGE the detected protein bands migrated at molecular masses significantly higher

156

than the 145 kDa predicted for full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein based on its amino acid sequence,

157

we hypothesized that the proteins might be glycosylated. Indeed, NetNGlyc 1.0 server analysis

158

indicated the presence of at least 17 N-glycosylation sites for co-and post-translational

159

modifications. The treatment of cell lysates with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which

160

removes all N-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins, reduced the molecular masses of

161

the recombinant SARS-2-S protein bands from 190 kDa to 145 kDa and from 90-100 kDa to 65 kDa,

162

matching the expected sizes of unmodified SARS-CoV-2 S and the S2 cleavage product,

163

respectively (Fig 2C).

164

Interestingly, the S2 cleavage band was more prominent in the lysates from infected CEF cells,

165

whereas lysates from infected Vero cells contained more full-length protein, suggesting host cell-

166

specific differences in the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein (Fig. 2B). More importantly, both

167

isoforms were detectable as early as 2 hours post-infection (hpi), indicating proper early

168

transcription from the synthetic MVA promoter PmH5, and their amount increased up to 24 hpi,

169

consistent with the timing of abundant vaccinia viral late protein synthesis (Fig. 2C). Moreover,

170

Western blot analysis using serum antibodies from a COVID-19 patient hospitalized with

171

pneumonia also revealed protein bands corresponding to the molecular masses of full-length S

172

protein or the S2 polypeptide (Fig. 2D).

173

MVA-SARS-2-S induced antibody responses in mice. To evaluate whether MVA-SARS-CoV-2

174

induces SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, we vaccinated BALB/c mice with a low-dose (LD) or high-

175

dose (HD) of MVA-SARS-CoV-2 (107 or 108 plaque-forming units (PFU), respectively) using

176

intramuscular (i.m.) administration and prime-boost immunization schedules with a 3-week interval

177

(Fig. 3, SI Appendix, Fig. S2). At day 18 after the prime inoculation, we detected serum IgG

178

antibodies binding to whole recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the sera from 3/8 LD-vaccinated

179

and 4/6 HD-vaccinated animals by ELISA (Fig. 3A). Following the booster immunization on day 21,

180

all vaccinated animals mounted high levels of S-binding serum IgG antibodies with mean titers of

181

1:900 for the LD vaccination group and 1:1257 for the HD group (Fig. 3A). More importantly, sera

182

from vaccinated mice also contained antibodies binding to the S protein receptor-binding domain

183

(RBD). Already at day 18 post priming, the RBD-binding antibodies were detected in 33% of the

184

mice in the LD dose group (2/6 mice, mean OD value 0.35) and 50% of the mice receiving the HD

185

immunization (3/6, mean OD 0.63). The boost vaccinations increased the levels of RBD specific

186

antibodies with 87.5% seropositive mice in the 107 dose group (7/8, mean OD 1.81) and 100% of

187

the animals vaccinated with 108 PFU MVA-SARS2-S (8/8, mean OD 2.92) (Figure 3B). Since live

188

virus neutralization is the gold standard for coronavirus serologic analysis, we next assessed the

189

mouse sera in two different assays for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, a plaque reduction

190

neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) (24) and a complete virus neutralization test (VNT100) (9) (Fig. 3 C

191

and D). On day 18 following prime immunization the PRNT50 revealed low amounts of SARS-CoV-

192

2 neutralizing antibodies in 50-80% of the sera from vaccinated animals (PRNT50 titres of 20-40 for

193

both dose groups). After the boost vaccinations we detected neutralizing activities in all sera from

194

MVA-SARS-2-S vaccinated mice with average PRNT50 titres of 117 (LD) and 600 (HD) (Fig. 3C).

195

Using the VNT100 assay we detected neutralizing activities in 79% of all sera following MVA-SARS-

196

2-S booster immunizations with mean reciprocal titres of 19.8 (4/6 seropositive mice, LD group)

197

and 105.8 (7/8 mice, HD group) (Fig. 3D). We obtained similar results when testing the sera in a

198

recently established high-throughput surrogate virus neutralization test for SARS CoV-2

199

(sVNT)(25) . After the boost immunizations on day 21, we detected levels of surrogate neutralizing

200

antibodies with mean titers of 400 (4/6 seropositive mice, LD) and 840 (6/6, HD) (Fig. 3E, SI

201

Appendix, Fig. S3). Altogether, these results indicate that both LD and HD 3-week prime-boost

202

immunization protocols induce a robust anti-SARS-CoV2-S humoral response and lead to

203

generation of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV2-S antibodies.

204

MVA-SARS-2-S induced T cell responses in mice. To assess the activation of SARS-CoV-2-

205

specific cellular immunity, we monitored S-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice

206

vaccinated with LD or HD MVA-SARS-2-S in prime and prime-boost immunization schedules using

207

3-week intervals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). To assess S antigen-specific T cells by IFN-γ ELISPOT,

208

we isolated splenocytes at day 8 after MVA-SARS-2-S prime or boost immunization and used S-

209

specific peptide stimulation for activation upon in vitro culture. Since information is limited on

210

antigen specificities of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, we screened the Immune Epitope Database

211

(IEDB) to select putative S-specific peptide epitopes compatible with activation of CD8+ or CD4+

212

T cells (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2). When testing pools of the predicted peptides with

213

splenocytes from BALB/c mice immunized with 108 PFU MVA-SARS-2-S, we detected responses

214

above background in several peptide pools and identified the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 S H2-

215

Kd epitope S269-278 (GYLQPRTFL; S1 N-terminal domain, SI Appendix, Fig. S4). To evaluate the

216

primary activation of SARS-2-S epitope specific CD8+ T cells, we inoculated BALB/c mice once

217

with LD or HD MVA-SARS-2 and analyzed splenocytes on day 8 after vaccination. Single

218

intramuscular immunizations with MVA-SARS-2-S already induced substantial levels of S269-278

219

epitope-specific activated CD8+ T cells with mean numbers of 341 IFN-γ spot forming cells (SFC)

220

in 106 splenocytes for LD and 275 SFC for HD compared to control mice immunized with non-

221

recombinant MVA (no SFC detectable) (Fig. 4A). ELISPOT data aligned well with FACS analysis

222

of T cells intracellulary stained for IFN-γ, where we also found higher frequencies (means of 0.32-

223

0.36%) and higher absolute numbers of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells in splenocytes from vaccinated

224

animals compared to control mice (Fig. 4B). Substantial numbers of the activated IFN-γ+ CD8+ T

225

cells also co-expressed TNF-α (means of 0.22% and 0.27% of TNF-α expressing cells from total

226

IFN-γ+ expressing cells) (Fig. 4C). Of note, the magnitude of SARS-2-S-specific CD8+ T cells did

227

not significantly differ when comparing the groups of mice immunized with LD or HD of MVA-SARS-

228

2-S.

229

The booster immunizations on day 21 further increased the magnitudes of S-specific CD8+ T cells

230

in response to MVA-SARS-2-S vaccination. At day 8 post boost, ELISPOT analysis revealed

231

means of 1,020 IFN-γ SFC in LD vaccinated mice and 1,159 IFN-γ SFC in animals receiving HD

232

MVA-SARS-2-S (Fig. 4D). Intracellular FACS analysis identified frequencies of 0.62% or 0.60%

233

and absolute numbers of 40,873 or 49,553 IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells for mice immunized with LD or HD

234

MVA-SARS-2-S (Fig. 4E). Again, we confirmed that the majority (~75%) of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells

235

also expressed TNF-α (Fig. 4F). The MVA-specific immunodominant CD8+ T cell determinant

236

F2(G)26-34 (SPGAAGYDL(26)) served as a control peptide for the detection and comparative

237

analysis of MVA vector-specific CD8+ T cells in BALB/c mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 and Fig. S6).

238

In addition, using SARS-2-S derived peptides with predicted capacity for MHC II binding we also

239

monitored the presence of activated CD4+ T cells. Using three different peptide pools (SI Appendix,

240

Table S2), we confirmed the presence of spike-specific CD4+ T cells in the spleens of mice

241

immunized with LD and HD prime-boost regiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).

242

Protective capacity of MVA-SARS-2-S upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. To model productive

243

infection with SARS-CoV-2, we used an adenoviral transduction-based mouse model similar to

244

those described recently (27, 28). We intratracheally transduced MVA-SARS-2-S vaccinated

245

BALB/c mice with 5x108 PFU of an adenoviral vector encoding both the human ACE2 receptor and

246

the marker protein mCherry (ViraQuest Inc., North Liberty, IA, USA) at about two weeks after prime-

247

boost immunization. Three days later the animals were infected with 1.5x104 tissue culture

248

infectious dose 50 (TCID50) SARS-CoV-2 (isolate BavPat1/2020 isolate, European Virus Archive

249

Global # 026V-03883), and four days post challenge the animals were sacrificed, blood samples

250

taken, and the lungs harvested to measure viral loads. Substantial virus RNA loads, on average

Discussion

262
263

Here, we report that the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S is compatible with clinical

264

use and industrial-scale production. Building on extensive prior experience developing a candidate

265

vaccine against MERS (17-19, 21), we selected the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein for delivery

266

by recombinant MVA. The vector virus replicated efficiently in DF-1 cells, the cell substrate for an

267

optimized manufacturing process, and MVA-SARS-2-S stably produces S glycoprotein antigen

268

upon serial amplifications at low multiplicities of infection.

269
270

Similar to our experience gained with MVA-MERS-S, expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene by

271

recombinant MVA resulted in a glycoprotein migrating at a molecular mass of about 190 kDa.

272

Treatment with glycosidase to remove all N-linked carbohydrates produced a polypeptide of

273

145 kDa, closely corresponding to the molecular weight predicted from S gene nucleotide

274

sequence. In addition, we observed S1 and S2 cleavage of the full-length SARS-2 S polypeptide,

275

apparently with various efficiencies of proteolytic processing depending on the cell substrate of

276

protein production. This finding is in agreement with previous reports suggesting complex activation

277

of the betacoronavirus S glycoproteins, including the involvement of multiple cleavage events and

278

several host proteases (29, 30). Similar to our findings with the MVA-produced MERS-CoV S

279

protein, SARS-CoV-2 S-specific detection by immunofluorescence included strong surface staining

280

of MVA-SARS-2-S infected cells. We conclude that the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein is

281

trafficking through the Golgi apparatus and is expressed at the cell surface, as shown previously

282

for functional S produced from plasmid expression vectors (7, 31, 32).

283
284

Since the biochemical characterization of the MVA-expressed S suggested production of a mature

285

and properly folded spike antigen, we investigated whether MVA-SARS-2-S elicits S-specific

286

immune responses. In proof-of-principle experiments, mice receiving the MVA-SARS-2-S vaccine

287

twice intramuscularly developed circulating S-specific antibodies that neutralized SARS-CoV-2

288

infections in cell culture and mounted high levels of SARS-2-S-specific CD8+ T cells. MVA-SARS-

289

2-S elicited levels of virus neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice that were comparable to those

290

induced by ChAdOx1nCoV-19 or MVA-MERS-S vaccinations (18, 33) and evidence from

291

preclinical studies in non-human primates and hamsters indicate that vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-

292

2 neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against lung infection and clinical disease (34-

293

36). The humoral immune responses elicited by MVA-SARS-2-S and measured by ELISA, two

294

different SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays and a surrogate neutralization assay pointed to a clear

295

benefit of a booster immunization. These data are in line with results from phase 1 clinical testing

296

of our MVA-MERS-S candidate vaccine providing evidence of humoral immunogenicity using

297

homologous prime-boost vaccination (21). For SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we found a

298

strong correlation between the results obtained from authentic virus neutralization (PRNT50,

299

VNT100) and the data from surrogate neutralization (sVNT). These data corroborate the findings of

300

a recent study comparing this high-throughput sVNT assay to a pseudotyped virus neutralization

301

assay based on SARS-CoV-2 S protein-carrying vesicular stomatitis virus (25).

302

The i.m. immunizations of BALB/c mice with low and high-dose MVA-SARS-2-S induced robust

303

and nearly equal amounts of SARS-S-specific CD8+ T cells in prime and prime-boost vaccination.

304

The average number of S-specific T cells was comparable to the average number of MVA vector-

305

specific T cells highlighting the strong immunogenicity of MVA-SARS-2-S for inducing a SARS-S-

306

specific CD8+ T cell response. The importance of vaccine induced T cell responses is illustrated

307

by studies not only monitoring the adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients, but also

308

demonstrating that strong SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses are associated

309

with low disease severity in individuals with COVID-19 (5).

310
311

When tested in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection all vaccinated BALB/c mice exhibited

312

little or no replication of SARS-CoV-2, irrespective whether low or high-dose MVA-SARS-2-S was

313

used for vaccination. Particularly encouraging was the complete absence of detectable infectious

314

virus in the lung tissues of immunized animals. Notably, we found no evidence of a potential

315

enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection through S-antigen-specific antibody induction, confirming

316

our data with MVA-MERS-S that the S glycoprotein is an important and safe vaccine antigen (18,

317

19).

318

Overall, the MVA-SARS-2-S vector vaccine merits further development and the results presented

319

here provided information for the start of a phase 1 clinical trial on 30 September 2020. To

320

counteract the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, candidate vaccines are being rapidly investigated in

321

unprecedented numbers, and first front-runner vaccines are obtaining emergency licensing in

322

Europe and the USA in 2020 (37). Yet, there is still much to learn when moving forward in COVID-

323

19 vaccination. We expect that optimized protective immunity to COVD-19 will require vaccine

324

approaches eliciting antiviral SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a coordinated

325

manner, together with virus neutralizing antibodies, in various population groups including children,

326

the elderly and individuals with comorbidities.

340

in DMEM with high glucose and 10% FBS. Human HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were maintained in

341

Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), 7% FBS and

342

1% MEM non-essential amino acid solution. Human HaCat cells (CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH,

344

solution and 1% HEPES solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). All cells were cultivated

345

at 37 °C and 5 % CO2.

346

Plasmid construction. The coding sequence of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SARS-2-

347

S) was modified in silico by introducing silent mutations to remove runs of guanines or cytosines

348

and termination signals of vaccinia virus-specific early transcription. In addition, a C-terminal tag

349

sequence encoding nine amino acids (YPYDVPDYA, aa 98-106(38) from influenza virus

350

hemagglutinin (HAtag) was added. The modified SARS-2-S cDNA was produced by DNA synthesis

351

(Eurofins, Ebersberg, Germany) and cloned into the MVA transfer plasmid pIIIH5red under

352

transcriptional control of the synthetic vaccinia virus early/late promoter PmH5 (22) to obtain the

353

MVA expression plasmid pIIIH5red-SARS-2-S.

354

Generation of recombinant viruses. MVA vector viruses were obtained following the established

355

protocols for vaccine development as described in previous studies (17, 21, 39) MVA (clonal isolate

356

MVA-F6-sfMR) was grown on CEF under serum-free conditions and served a as non-recombinant

357

backbone virus to construct MVA vector viruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences.

358

Briefly, monolayers of 90-95% confluent DF-1 or CEF cells were grown in six-well tissue culture

359

plates (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany), infected with non-recombinant MVA at 0.05 multiplicity of

360

infection (MOI), and transfected with plasmid pIIIH5red-SARS-2-S DNA using X-tremeGENE HP

361

DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manual.

363

serial rounds of plaque purification on DF-1 or CEF cell monolayers monitoring for transient co-

364

production of the red fluorescent marker protein mCherry. To obtain vaccine preparations,

365

recombinant MVA–SARS-2-S were amplified on CEF or DF-1 cell monolayers grown in T175 tissue

366

culture flasks, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose and reconstituted to high titre

367

stock preparations in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4. Plaque-forming units (PFU) were counted to

368

determine viral titres (23).

369

In vitro characterization of recombinant MVA-SARS-2-S. Genetic identity and genetic stability

370

of vector viruses was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using viral DNA and detection

371

of S-protein synthesis following serial passage at low MOI. For the latter, 95% confluent DF-1 cells

372

were infected at MOI 0.05, incubated for 48h, harvested and used for reinfection. In total, five

373

rounds of low MOI passage were performed. After the fifth passage, sixty virus isolates were

374

obtained and amplified in 24-well DF-1 cultures for further testing. PCR analysis was performed to

375

confirm genetic stability of viral genomes and MVA- and SARS-2-S-specific immunostaining served

376

to monitor recombinant gene expression. The replicative capacity of recombinant MVA was tested

377

in multi-step-growth experiments on monolayers of DF-1, HaCat, HeLa or A549 cells grown in 6-

378

well-tissue-culture plates. Viruses were inoculated at MOI 0.05, harvested at 0, 4, 8, 24, 48, and

379

72 h after infection, and titrated on CEF monolayers to determine infectivities in cell lysates in PFU.

380

Western Blot analysis of recombinant protein. To monitor production of the recombinant SARS-

381

2-S protein, DF-1 cells were infected at MOI 10 with recombinant or non-recombinant MVA or

382

remained uninfected (mock). At indicated time points of infection, cell lysates were prepared from

383

infected cells and stored at −80 °C. Proteins from lysates were separated by electrophoresis in a

384

sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-10% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE; Bio-Rad, Munich) and

385

subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The blots were blocked

Immunostaining of recombinant SARS-2-S protein. Vero cells were infected with 0.05 MOI

398

MVA-SARS-2-S or non-recombinant MVA and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were fixed with

399

4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min on ice, washed two times with PBS, and permeabilized

400

with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) solution in PBS. Permeabilized cells

401

were probed with a monoclonal antibody against the HA-tag epitope (1:1000; HA Tag mAb 2-

402

2.2.14, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Planegg, Germany) to detect SARS-2-S protein. Non-

403

permeabilized cells were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody obtained against the S protein

404

of SARS-CoV-1 (SARS-1-S; 1:200; GeneTex) before fixation with PFA. Polyclonal goat anti-mouse

405

secondary antibody (1:1000; Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to visualize S-

406

specific staining by red fluorescence. Nuclei were stained with 1 µg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-

407

phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and cells were analyzed using the

408

Keyence BZ-X700 microscope (Keyence, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) with a ×100 objective.

496

ImmunoSpot Image Analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH, https://www.immunospot.eu). The serum

SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization test (VNT100). The neutralizing activity of mouse serum

500

antibodies was investigated based on a previously published protocol (9). Briefly, samples were

501

serially diluted in 96-well plates starting from a 1:16 serum dilution. Samples were incubated for 1

502

h at 37°C together with 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2

503

(BavPat1/2020 isolate, European Virus Archive Global # 026V-03883). Cytopathic effects (CPE)

504

on VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL1586) were analyzed 4 days after infection. Neutralization was defined

505

as the absence of CPE compared to virus controls. For each test, a positive control (neutralizing

506

COVID-19 patient plasma) was used in duplicates as an inter-assay neutralization standard. Ethical

507

approval was granted by the Ethics Committee at the Medical Faculty of LMU Munich (vote 20-225

508

KB) in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Prediction and generation of synthetic SARS-2-S peptides. The sequence of the SARS-CoV-

510

2 S protein (NCBI ID: QHD43416.1, Uniprot ID: P0DTC2 (SPIKE_SARS2)) served for epitope

511

prediction, and probable CD8+ and CD4+ T cell determinants were examined with the Immune

512

Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB, https://www.iedb.org/). For identification of

513

potential CD8+ T cell determinants, the MHC-I Binding Prediction and MHC-I Processing Prediction

514

tools (42, 43) were used and projections for 9-11mer peptides spanning the entire SARS-2-S

515

protein sequence were obtained. The inputs selected for the search included the Prediction Method

516

‘IEDB recommended 2.22’, the MHC source species ‘Mouse’ and the MHC class I alleles H2-Kd,

517

H2-Dd and H2-Ld. The output was restricted to a percentile rank cut-off of 10.0. After lists of peptides

518

were generated, all peptides with an IC50 score of 500nM or less were selected for inclusion in the

top 5% list. All the peptides in this list were further analyzed using the MHC-I Processing Prediction

520

tool ‘Proteasomal cleavage/TAP transport/MHC class I combined predictor’. All peptides with an

521

IC50 score of 500nM or less and a high total score were chosen and subsequently included in the

522

top peptides list. To confirm that these peptides were potential binders of MHC class I alleles H2-

523

Kd, H2-Dd and H2-Ld, they were further screened for MHC I binding using the RankPep server(44).

524

Peptides that were found to bind to any of the above alleles were selected for synthesis and testing.

525

For the identification of potential CD4+ T cell determinants, the MHC-II Binding Prediction tool (42,

526

43) served to obtain 15mer peptides spanning the entire SARS-2-S protein sequence. The inputs

527

for the analysis included the Prediction Method ‘IEDB recommended 2.22’, the MHC source

528

species ‘Mouse’ and the MHC class II alleles H2-IAd and H2-IEd. Peptides with percentile rank of

529

10.0 or less and an IC50 score of 1000 nM or less were further tested for MHC class II binding

530

using the RankPep server (44). Peptides bound to any of the above MHC class II alleles were

531

selected for synthesis and testing. All peptides were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc

532

(Planegg, Germany) as crude material (<50% purity) at a 1–4 mg scale, dissolved in PBS or DMSO

533

to 2 mg/ml, aliquoted and stored at -20 ⸰C.

534

T cell analysis by Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISPOT). At days 8 and 14 post prime or

535

prime-boost vaccination, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were prepared. Briefly, spleens

536

were passed through a 70 µm strainer (Falcon®, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and

537

incubated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Cells were

538

washed and resuspended in RPMI-10 (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin-

539

Streptomycin, 1% HEPES; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). ELISPOT assay (Mabtech

540

ELISpot kit for mouse IFN-γ, Biozol, Eching, Germany) was performed to measure IFN-γ-producing

541

T cells following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2x105 splenocytes/100µl were seeded in

542

96-well plates and stimulated with individual peptides (2 µg/mL RPMI-10). Non-stimulated cells and

543

cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) / ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen,

546

were counted and analyzed by using an automated ELISPOT plate reader and software following

547

the manufacturer’s instructions (A.EL.VIS Eli.Scan, A.EL.VIS ELISPOTAnalysis Software,

549

T cell analysis by Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS). The detailed methods for intracellular

550

cytokine staining (ICS) were described previously(41). Briefly, whole splenocytes were diluted in

551

RPMI-10 and plated onto 96-well-U-bottom plates using 106 cells/well. Cells were stimulated with

552

8 µg/ml S269-278 peptide or vaccinia virus peptide F226-34 for analysis of SARS-2-S- or MVA-specific

553

CD8+ T cells. Splenocytes stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (500 ng/ml) served as

554

positive controls and RPMI alone was used as a negative control. After 2 h at 37 °C, brefeldin A

555

(Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) was added according to the manufacturer’s instructions and

556

stimulated cells were further maintained for 4 h at 37 °C. After the stimulations, cells were washed

557

with FACS buffer (MACSQuant Running Buﬀer, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, plus

558

2% FBS) and stained extracellularly with anti-mouse CD3 phycoerithrin (PE)-Cy7 (clone 17A2,

562

washing, cells were incubated with 100 µl/well of the fixable dead cell viability dye Zombie Aqua

563

(1:800, Biolegend) diluted in PBS for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed, fixed with 100 µl/well

564

of Fixation Buﬀer (Biolegend) for 20 min at room temperature, washed again, resuspended in

565

200 µl/well of FACS buffer and stored overnight at 4 °C. Next, cells were permeabilized using

566

Intracellular Staining Permeabilization Wash Buﬀer (Perm Wash buffer; Biolegend; dilution 1:10),

567

and stained intracellularly in 100 µl/well of anti-mouse IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2, 1:200, Biolegend) plus

568

anti-mouse TNF-α (clone MP6-XT22, 1:200, Biolegend) diluted in Perm Wash buﬀer for 30 min at

Fig. 1. Construction and virological characterization of MVA-SARS-2-S. (A) Schematic diagram of the MVA genome with the major
deletion sites I to VI. The site of deletion III was targeted for insertion of the gene sequence encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV-2
isolate Wuhan-HU-1 (SARS-2-S). SARS-2-S was placed under transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus promoter PmH5 within the
MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red-SARS-2-S. Insertion occurred via homologous recombination between MVA DNA sequences (flank-1
and flank-2) adjacent to deletion site III in the MVA genome and copies cloned in the vector plasmid. MVA-SARS-2-S was isolated by
plaque purification screening for co-production of the red fluorescent marker protein mCherry. A repetition of short flank-1 derived
DNA sequences (del) served to remove the marker gene by intragenomic homologous recombination (marker gene deletion).

(B) Genetic integrity of MVA-SARS-2-S (MVA-S). PCR analysis of genomic viral DNA
confirmed stable insertion of the SARS-2-S sequence into deletion site III of the MVA
genome. The precise intragenomic deletion of the marker gene mCherry during plaque
purification was revealed by amplification of a PCR product with the expected
molecular weight (4.8 kb) from MVA-S genomic DNA compared to the large product
amplified from pIIIH5red-SARS-2-S plasmid DNA template (pIII-S). The deletion III sitespecific oligonucleotide primers amplified a characteristic 0.762 kb DNA fragment from
genomic, non-recombinant MVA DNA.

(C) Multiple-step growth analysis of recombinant MVA-SARS-2-S (MVA-S) and
non-recombinant MVA (MVA). Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.05 with MVA-S or MVA and collected at the indicated time points.
Titration was performed on CEF cells and plaque-forming units (PFU) were
determined. MVA-S and MVA could be efficiently amplified on DF-1 but failed to
productively grow on cells of human origin (HaCat, HeLa and A549).

Fig. 5. Protective capacity of MVA-SARS-2-S immunization against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human ACE2-transduced BALB/c mice. Groups of BALB/c mice (n = 4-6)
were immunized twice with 10*7 or 10*8 PFU of MVA-SARS-2-S (MVA-S) over a 21-day interval via the i.m. route. Mock immunized mice (PBS) served as controls.
About two weeks after the last immunization the mice were sensitized with an adenovirus expressing hACE2 and mCherry and infected with SARS-CoV-2 five days
after transduction. Four days post challenge the animals were sacrificed and samples were taken for further analysis. (A) Lung tissues were harvested to determine
SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads by viral genome copies, (B) the expression of mCherry by mRNA copies, or (C) the amounts of infectious SARS-CoV-2 by TCID50/ml. (D) Sera
were tested for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by virus neutralization (VNT100). Statistical evaluation was performed with GraphPad Prism for Windows.
Statistical significance of differences between groups is indicated as follows: *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001.
