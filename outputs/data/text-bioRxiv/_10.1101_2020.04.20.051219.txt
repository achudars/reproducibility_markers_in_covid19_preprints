Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 enters cells using its Spike protein, which is also the main target of
neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spikemediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafetylevel-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with
Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral and VSV
particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here we detail how to effectively
pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express
the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the
BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these
pseudotyped lentiviral particles can be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or
plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable
complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.

1. Introduction
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies that bind to the virus [1–6]. But as is the case for all
viruses [7–10], only some of these antibodies neutralize the virus’s ability to enter cells [4,5,11,12].
While studies of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 are limited, for many other viruses neutralizing antibodies
are more strongly correlated with protection against re-infection or disease than antibodies that bind
but do not neutralize [7–10,13–15]. Indeed, for other coronaviruses, neutralizing antibodies are
protective in mouse models of infection [16–20] and associated with at least some reduced
susceptibility to re-infection or disease in humans [15,21,22]. Furthermore, anecdotal reports suggest
that passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies to sick patients may help alleviate disease from SARSCoV-2 and its close relative SARS-CoV [23–25].

But while there are now well-characterized and high-throughput methods (such as ELISA
assays) to measure total antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 or some of its key constituent proteins
[2,6,26], quantifying neutralizing antibody activity is more difficult. The most biologically relevant
method is to directly measure how antibodies or sera inhibit infection of cells by replicationcompetent SARS-CoV-2. Such live-virus assays have now been performed to quantify neutralizing
activity in the sera of infected patients or characterize the potency of individual antibodies [1,6,12,27].
However, the throughput and accessibility of live-virus neutralization assays with SARS-CoV-2 is
limited by the fact that the virus is a biosafety-level-3 agent that must be worked with in specialized
facilities.
An alternative approach that alleviates these biosafety limitations leverages the fact that all
known neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (and other coronaviruses that lack an HE protein)
target the virus’s Spike protein [1,12,27]. Spike protrudes prominently from the surface of SARS-CoV2 virions, and is necessary and sufficient to enable the virus to bind and enter cells [28]. Spike from
several coronaviruses can be “pseudotyped” onto safer non-replicative viral particles in place of their
endogenous entry protein, thereby making entry of these particles into cells dependent on Spike [29–
36]. For SARS-CoV-2, such pseudotyping has recently been reported using HIV-based lentiviral
particles [4,27,37], MLV-based retroviral particles [12,38], and VSV [29,39–41]. In the data reported to
date, results from such pseudovirus neutralization assays correlate well with measurements made
using live SARS-CoV-2 [1,12,27,39]. However, the detailed protocols and reagents to perform such
assays are not yet widely available to the scientific community.
Here we fill this gap by providing a detailed description of how to pseudotype lentiviral particles
with Spike. We explain how these pseudotyped particles can be used to conveniently measure Spikemediated cell entry via fluorescent or luciferase reporters, and to quantify the neutralizing activity of
human plasma. Finally, we describe all the necessary experimental reagents and make them available
in the BEI Resources reagent repository (https://www.beiresources.org/).
2. Results
2.1. General approach for pseudotyping lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike.
The basic strategy for pseudotyping HIV-1-derived lentiviral particles is shown in Figure 1A. It
involves transfecting 293T cells with a lentiviral backbone plasmid encoding a fluorescent or
luminescent reporter protein, a plasmid expressing Spike, and plasmids expressing the minimal set
of lentiviral proteins necessary to assemble viral particles. The transfected cells then produce Spikepseudotyped lentiviral particles that can be used to infect permissive cells that express the SARSCoV-2 receptor protein, ACE2 [28,29,41,42].
We used an HIV-based lentiviral system to produce viral particles pseudotyped with Spike. As
shown in Figure 1A, his system requires co-transfecting cells with a lentiviral backbone encoding the
reporter protein(s), a plasmid expessing Spike, and plasmids encoding the other HIV proteins
necessary for virion formation (Tat, Gag-Pol, and Rev). We used two different lentiviral backbones:
one that uses a CMV promoter to drive expression of just ZsGreen, and another that uses a CMV
promoter to drive exprssion of luciferase followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and
ZsGreen (hereafter referred to as the ZsGreen and Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen backbones).

Figure 1. General approach for lentiviral pseudotyping. (A) 293T cells are transfected with a plasmid
encoding a lentiviral backbone (genome) expressing a marker protein, a plasmid expressing Spike,
and plasmids expressing the other HIV proteins needed for virion formation (Tat, Gag-Pol, and Rev).
The transfected cells produce lentiviral particles with Spike on their surface. These viral particles can
infect cells that express the ACE2 receptor. (B) We used three variants of Spike: the codon-optimized
Spike from SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1, a variant containing mutations K1269A and H1271A in
the cytoplasmic tail (such that the C-terminal five amino acids are ALAYT), and a variant in which
the cytoplasmic tail of Spike has been replaced with that from influenza hemagglutinin (HA). (C)
Spike expression on the surface of 293T cells transfected with the plasmids expressing our three Spike
constructs was measured using flow cytometry 24 hours post-transfection. Spike expression was
measured by staining with in-house produced CR3022 antibody [43–45] at a concentration of 10
µg/mL followed by staining with an anti-human Fc antibody conjugated to APC (Jackson Labs, 109135-098) at a 1:100 dilution.

The Spike protein was from SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1 using the NCBI-annotated start
site [46], with the nucleotide sequence codon optimized for expression in human cells. We used three
variants of Spike (Figure 1B). The first variant was simply the codon-optimized Spike. The second
variant had two amino-acid mutations to basic residues in Spike’s cytoplasmic tail (K1269A and
H1271A) that change the sequence of the five most C-terminal residues to ALAYT. This variant is
hereafter referred to as Spike-ALAYT. The rationale for Spike-ALAYT was that for the original SARSCoV, the two analagous mutations were shown to improve plasma-membrane expression of Spike
by eliminating an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal [47,48]. The third variant had the
cytoplasmic tail of Spike replaced with that from influenza hemagglutinin (HA); this variant is
hereafter referred to as Spike-HAtail. The rationale for Spike-HAtail was that for the original SARSCoV, deleting Spike’s cytoplasmic tail or replacing it with that from other viruses was shown to
improve pseudotyping efficiency [30,49–51]. We validated that there was expression of Spike on the
surface of 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing each of these three variants (Figure 1C).

The sequences of all of the Spike and lentiviral plasmids are in File S1, and the plasmids are
available from BEI Resources (see Materials and Methods for BEI catalog numbers).
2.2. Target 293T cells constititutively expressing Spike’s ACE2 receptor.
To create a target cell line that is efficiently infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral
particles, we transduced 293T cells with a lentiviral vector expressing human ACE2 under an EF1a
promoter (lentiviral backbone plasmid sequence is in File S1, and is available from BEI Resources as
item NR-52512). To create a clonal cell line from the bulk transduction, we sorted single transduced
cells by flow cytometry and re-expanded into large populations (note that there is not a selectable
marker in these cells). We identified an expanded clone that expressed high levels of ACE2 (Figure
2A). This ACE2 expression appears stable overtime and has not noticeably decreased through twelve
passages at the time of writing. This clone is hereafter referred to as 293T-ACE2, and is available from
BEI Resources as item NR-52511.

Flow cytometry plot showing expression of human ACE2 by the 293T-ACE2 cells (grey shaded) at
passage 12 compared to parental 293T cells (white fill) as quantified by staining with an anti-ACE2
antibody (see subsection 4.2 for detailed methods). The gate was set so the parental 293T cells are 2%
positive. (B) Microscope images showing ZsGreen expression in 293T-ACE2 or 293T cells at 58 hours
after incubation with Spike- or VSV G-pseudotyped lentiviral particles with the ZsGreen backbone.
For each viral entry protein, 293T and 293T-ACE2 cells were incubated with equal volumes of virus.
Cells were incubated with 1/20th the volume of VSV G-pseudotyped lentivirus compared to Spikepseudotyped lentivirus. The decrease in infected cells for the Spike-HAtail virus compared to the
other Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses is consistent with this virus having somewhat lower titers (see
Fig. 2A).

We validated that the 293T-ACE2 cells were susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spikepseudotyped lentiviral particles by incubating 293T-ACE2 and parental 293T with equivalent
amounts of viral particles carrying ZsGreen. As shown in Figure 2B, all Spike-pseudotyped viruses
can infect the 293T-ACE2 but not the 293T cells. Virus pseudotyped with VSV G, an amphotropic
viral entry protein that is not dependent on ACE2, efficiently infects both cell lines (Figure 2B).
2.3. Titers of pseudotyped lentiviral particles with different Spike cytoplasmic tail variants.
To quantify the titers of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with each of the Spike variants, we produced
particles with each of these Spikes, as well as a positive control using VSV G and a negative control
without a viral entry protein. We first produced viral particles using the ZsGreen backbone, and
titered by flow cytometry to determine the number of transducing particles per ml. As shown in
Figure 3A, all Spike variants produced titers »104 transduction units per ml. These titers were about
two orders of magnitude lower than those achieved with VSV G, but we considered them to be
encouragingly high given that lentiviral particles can be further concentrated by a variety of methods
[52,53]. We then produced viral particles using the Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen backbone, and found

that we could achieve titers of >106 relative luciferase units (RLUs) per ml in 96-well plate infections
(Figure 1B). This titer was again about two orders of magnitude lower than that achieved using VSV
G. As expected, the magnitude of the fluorescent signal from ZsGreen is lower for the LuciferaseIRES-ZsGreen backbone than for the ZsGreen-only backbone (Figure 1C), since the ZsGreen in the
former construct is driven by an IRES rather than the primary promoter.

Figure 3. Titers of Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles in 293T-ACE2 cells. (A) Titers of the ZsGreen
backbone pseudotyped with the three Spike variants or VSV G, as determined by counting green cells
via flow cytometry analysis at 48 hours post-infection, and then calculating transduction-competent
viral particles per ml from the percentage of green cells. The “n.d.” indicates that the titer was not
detectable. (B) Titers of the Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen backbone as determined by measuring relative
luciferase units (RLUs). RLUs were determined at 48 hours after infecting ~2.3x104 293T-ACE2 cells
per well in 96-well plates. The RLUs per mL for the Spike-pseudotyped viruses are the average of
three 3-fold serial dilutions of virus starting at 50 µL virus in a total volume of 150 µL. For the VSV
G-pseudotyped virus, RLUs per mL were averaged from two 3-fold dilutions starting at 3 µL virus in
a total volume of 150 µL. (C) Microscope images showing 293T-ACE2 cells transduced with Spike
pseudotyped virus with either the ZsGreen or Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen backbone at 60 hours postinfection. As can be seen from the images, the ZsGreen backbone gives a stronger fluorescent signal
than the Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen backbone, presumably because this protein is expressed more
strongly as the sole CMV-promoter driven transcript than as the second transcript driven by an IRES.

2.4. Neutralization assays with Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles.
We next used the Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen viruses to perform neutralization assays in 96-well plates.
Because <105 RLUs per well of a 96-well plate are necessary to achieve a signal >1,000-fold above the
background luciferase activity of virus-only controls, this assay requires only a relatively modest
volume of virus is for a full 96-well plate neutralization assay.
We performed neutralization assays using plasma from a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected
patient collected at 19 days post-symptom onset, and with soluble ACE2 protein fused to an IgG Fc
domain (which neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by acting as a decoy receptor [54]). As negative controls (not
expected to neutralized) we used sera collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019.

For these assays, we first made serial dilutions of the plasma, sera, or soluble ACE2-Fc in a 96-well
plate. We then incubated these dilutions for 60 minutes with a volume of pseudotyped lentiviral
particles sufficient to achieve 2x105 RLUs of luciferase signal per well. Finally, we added the mix to a
pre-seeded plate of 293T-ACE2 cells. We measured the luciferase signal at 60 hours post-infection
(see Materials and Methods for a more detailed protocol).

Figure 4. Neutralization assays. (A) Neutralization assay using plasma collected from a confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infected patient at 19 days post-symptom onset (“p.s.o.”). The IC50 for this plasma was
1:2076 for the Spike-pseudotype, 1:1334 for the Spike-ALAYT-pseudotype, and 1:1605 for the Spike,
HAtail-pseudotype. (B) Neutralization assay using soluble ACE2 protein fused to the Fc domain from
IgG (ACE2-Fc). The IC50 for ACE2-Fc was 2.49 µg/mL for the Spike-psdeudotype, 1.75 µg/mL for the
Spike-ALAYT-pseudotype, and 0.25 µg/mL for the Spike-HAtail pseudotype. (C) Negative control
sera collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 does not neutralize the Spike-pseudotyped
lentiviral particles. The serum from 1989 was from a person of a similar age at the time of serum
collection as the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patient whose plasma was tested in A. High
concentrations of naïve serum do seem to enhance luciferase signal, perhaps because of components
that improve cell-growth. Each point shows the average of duplicate values with error bars showing
standard error.

Both the plasma from the confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patient and the soluble ACE2-Fc
effectively neutralized the virus (Figure 4A,B). For the plasma, the inhibitory concentrations 50%
(IC50s) were »1:1600 (± 25%) for all three Spike variants, which is in the range of values that have
been reported for sera and plasma from other SARS-CoV-2 patients at a similar time post-infection
[4]. For soluble ACE2-Fc, the IC50 was »2 µg/mL with the Spike and Spike-ALAYT-pseudotyped
lentiviral particles, but was notably lower for the Spike-HAtail pseudotyped lentiviral particles
(Figure 4B). Our measurement of »2 µg/mL for the unmodified Spike is higher than a previously
reported IC50 of 0.1 µg/ml for soluble ACE2-IgG [54]. We suspect that the difference could be because
our 293T-ACE2 target cells express high levels of ACE2 making them more resistant to neutralization
by soluble ACE2. As expected, there was no neutralization of the pseudotyped virus by either pooled
or individual human sera collected at dates prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4C).
Our results are equivocal as to whether the cytoplasmic tail modifications greatly alter
neutralization sensitivity. For the plasma neutralization, all three Spike variants (Spike, SpikeALAYT, and Spike-HAtail) exhibited similar neutralization profiles (Figure 4A). But for the soluble
ACE2, the Spike-HAtail virus was notably more neutralization sensitive than the other two Spike
variants (Figure 4B). While the mechanism underlying the distinct neutralization sensitivity observed
is unclear, it is possible that modifying the Spike’s cytoplasmic tail may alter opening of the receptor-

binding domains [28]. Therefore, we suggest performing the assays using the Spike without any
cytoplasmic tail modifications, particularly since none of the modifications tested here greatly
improved pseudotyped lentiviral particle titers.
3. Discussion
We describe a detailed protocol for producing SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles
and performing neutralization assays. Although this basic pseudotyping approach has been
described previously [4,12,27,29,37–41], we provide the first detailed protocol that makes all reagents
available in a public repository (https://www.beiresources.org/). We hope this protocol and reagents
will more easily enable others to assess the neutralizing activity of antibodies and sera reactive to
SARS-CoV-2.
We also found that modifying the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2 Spike did not greatly improve
titers of Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles. Indeed, one cytoplasmic tail modification we tested
potentially altered the neutralization sensitivity of the pseudotyped lentiviral particles, suggesting it
may be undesirable. While we did not test the full suite of cytoplasmic tail modifications that have
been used for pseudotyping with Spike from the original SARS-CoV [30,49–51], our results suggest
that modifications to the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike should be tested with caution.
Overall, we have described an easily accessible assay to study neutralizing antibody responses
to SARS-CoV-2 in a biosafety-level-2 laboratory. This assay allows human sera or plasma samples to
be screened in a convenient 96-well format, which will help facilitate the testing of large numbers of
patient samples to better understand the development of immunity and to potentially screen donors
for passive transfer of convalescent plasma [25,55].

to create the positive control lentivirus pseudotyped with VSV G. However, numerous VSV G expressing
plasmids are available from AddGene and other repositories.
4.2 Creation of 293T ACE2 cells.
VSV G-pseudotyped lentivirus packaging the human ACE2 was generated via co-transfecting 293T cells (ATCC,
CRL-3216) with the pHAGE2-EF1aInt-ACE2-WT plasmid (File S1) and lentiviral helper plasmids (HDM-VSVG,
HDM-Hgpm2, HDM-tat1b, and pRC-CMV-Rev1b). The resulting lentivirus was used to infect more 293T cells
in the presence of 5 ug/mL polybrene. The transduced cells were stained with anti-human ACE-2 polyclonal goat
IgG (AF933, R&D Systems) primary antibody at 1 ug/mL and donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor
488 (ab150129, Abcam) secondary antibody at a 1:2500 dilution and sorted based on antibody staining. Once
single cell clones had grown sufficiently, they were screened for ACE2 expression via flow cytometry and a clone
with high expression was expanded and named 293T-ACE2 (Figure 2A). For verifying expression via flow
cytometry, cells were harvested with enzyme-free dissociation buffer (ThermoFisher, 13151014) and stained with
anti-human ACE-2 polyclonal goat IgG primary antibody at 2 ug/mL and donkey anti-goat IgG (Alexa Fluor
488) secondary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. For each staining step, cells were incubated with antibody in the
dark at 4 C for 30 min. Cells were washed 3 times with 3% BSA in PBS following each stain.
The 293T-ACE2 cells can be grown in D10 growth media (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM Lglutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin) at 37 C and 5% carbon dioxide. Note that there is
not a selectable marker for the ACE2 expression. The 293T-ACE2 cells are available from BEI Resources as catalog
number NR-52511.
4.3 Detailed protocol for generation of pseudotyped lentiviral particles.
Pseudotyped lentiviruses can be generated by transfecting 293Ts as depicted in Figure 1A. We used the
following protocol:
1. Seed 293T cells in D10 growth media (see subsection 4.2 for media composition) so that they will be
50-70% confluent the next day. For a 6-well plate, this is 5x105 cells per well (2.5x105 cells per mL).
2. At 16-24 hours after seeding, transfect the cells with the plasmids required for lentiviral production.
We transfect using BioT (Bioland Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions and using the
following plasmid mix per well of a 6-well plate (plasmid amounts should be adjusted for larger
plates):
•
1 ug of lentiviral backbone–we used either the ZsGreen (NR-52520) or the Luciferase-IRESZsGreen (NR-52516) backbone
•
0.22 ug each of plasmids HDM-Hgpm2 (NR-52517), pRC-CMV-Rev1b (NR-52519), and
HDM-tat1b (NR-52518)
•
0.34 ug viral entry protein–either SARS-CoV-2 Spike (NR-52513, NR-52514, or NR-52515),
VSV G (positive control), or transfection carrier DNA (Promega E4881) as a negative control.
3. At 18 to 24 hours post-transfection, change the media to fresh, pre-warmed D10.
4. At 60 hours post transfection, collect virus by harvesting the supernatant from each well and filtering
it through a 0.45 um filter. Virus can be stored at 4 C for immediate use or frozen at -80 C. The titers of
Spike- and VSV G-pseudotyped lentiviruses were found to be unaffected by a freeze-thaw cycle (data
not shown). All titers presented here are from virus that was frozen at -80 C prior to use.
4.4 Detailed protocol for titering pseudotyped lentiviral particles
To determine viral titers, we used either flow cytometry (for viruses packaging the ZsGreen backbone) or a
luciferase assay (for viruses packaging the Luciferase-IRES-ZsGreen backbone). A detailed titering protocol is
described below and differences between these two readouts are noted:
1.

2.
3.
4.

Coat a 96-well cell-culture plate with 25 uL poly-L-lysine per well (Millipore Sigma, P4707) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Poly-L-lysine improves cell adherence and prevents cell disruption
during infection.
Seed a poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plate with 1.25x104 293T-ACE2 cells per well in D10 media.
The next day (12-24 hours post-seeding), count at least 2 wells of cells to determine the number of cells
present at infection.
Prepare serial dilutions of the viruses to be titered in a final volume of 150 uL D10 growth media.
a. For ZsGreen virus, we started with a 1:5 dilution and made three 1:5 serial dilutions.
b. For Spike-pseudotyped Luciferase_IRES_ZsGreen virus, we started with undiluted virus and
made three 1:3 dilutions. For VSV G-pseudotyped Luciferase_IRES_ZsGreen virus, we
started with a 1:50 dilution.

Gently remove the media from the cells and slowly add the virus dilutions.
Add polybrene (Sigma Aldrich, TR-1003-G) to a final concentration of 5 ug/mL. We did this by adding
3 uL of polybrene diluted to 250 ug/mL to our final infection volume of 150 uL. Polybrene is a
polycation that helps facilitate lentiviral infection through minimizing charge-repulsion between the
virus and cells [56].
At 48-60 hours post-infection, collect cells for analysis:
a. For flow cytometry:
i. Look at the cells under a fluorescent microscope and select wells that appear ~1-10%
positive. Harvest cells from these wells using trypsin and transfer them to a Vbottom plate or microcentrifuge tubes. Pellet cells at 300xg for 4 min and wash twice
with 3% BSA in PBS. After the final wash, resuspend in 1% BSA in PBS and analyze
via flow cytometry. We used a Becton Dickinson Celesta cell analysis machine with
a 530/30 filter to detect ZsGreen in the FITC channel. Resulting FCS files were
analyzed using FlowJo (v10).
ii. Calculate titers using the Poisson formula. If P is the percentage of cells that are
ZsGreen positive, then the titer per mL is: -ln(1 – P / 100) x (number of cells / well) /
(volume of virus per well in mL). Note that when the percentage of cells that are
ZsGreen positive is low, this formula is approximately equal to: (% ZsGreen positive
/ 100) x (number of cells / well) / volume of virus per well in mL). Furthermore, the titers
using even the Poisson equation will only be accurate if the percentage of cells that
are ZsGreen positive is relatively low (ideally 1-10%).
b.

For luciferase:
i. Thaw luciferase reagent at room temperature. We used the Bright-Glo Luciferase
Assay System (Promega, E2610).
ii. Prepare cells by removing 100 uL media from each well. Accounting for evaporation,
this leaves ~30 uL of media in each well.
iii. Add 30 uL of luciferase reagent, mix well, and transfer all 60 uL to a black-bottom
plate (Costar 96-well solid black, Fisher, 07-200-590).
iv. Incubate plate for 2 min at room temperature in the dark then measure luminescence
using a plate reader. We used a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader with no
attenuation and a luminescence integration time of 1 second.
v. Plot RLUs vs. virus dilution. Select an amount of virus for further assays where there
is sufficient (>1000-fold) signal above virus-only background and a linear
relationship between virus added and RLU.

Figure 5: Example plate layout for neutralization assays. It is possible to run full-dilution series of two sera
or plasma samples in duplicate on each plate with the necessary controls. These controls include media
only, cells only, and virus only wells, as well as 4 wells of virus infecting 293T cells to confirm the lack of
infection with Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus in the absence of ACE2. The average signal from the “Virus
Only” and “Virus + 293Ts” wells provides the background signal. The “Virus + Cells” wells represent
maximum infection without any serum and provide a metric for 100% virus infectivity. Note that “cells”
here refers to the 293T-ACE2 cells.

4.5 Detailed protocol for neutralization assays.
The following protocol was developed to streamline neutralization assays with Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses.
This protocol can be performed with either human sera or plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. Note that for safety,
sera or plasma should be heat-inactivated in a biosafety cabinet prior to use as described in subsection 4.6.
1.

Seed a poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plate with 1.25x104 293T-ACE2 cells (BEI NR-52511) per well in 50
uL DMEM (2.5x105 cells per mL). Plan to infect this plate 8–12 hours post-seeding.

2.

About 1.5 hours prior to infecting cells, begin preparing serum and/or ACE2 dilutions in D10:
a.

In a separate 96-well “setup” plate, serially dilute serum samples leaving 60 uL diluted serum
in each well. For the data in Figures 4A & 4C, we started at an initial serum dilution of 1:80
and did serial 2.5-fold dilutions, meaning each replicate of the assay requires 5 uL of sera. For
ACE2 (Fig. 4) we started with a concentration of 200 ug/mL and did serial 3-fold dilutions.

b.

Add 60 uL of D10 to wells corresponding to virus only and virus plus cells control wells. Add
120 uL of D10 to media only and cells only control wells. See Figure 5 for an example plate
layout.

3.

Dilute virus to ~2-4x106 RLU per mL. Add 60 uL of diluted virus to all wells containing serum dilutions
and the virus only and virus plus cells control wells.

4.

Incubate virus and serum at 37 C for 1 hr.

5.

Carefully add 100 uL from each well of the setup plate containing the sera and virus dilutions to the
corresponding wells of the plate of 293T-ACE2 cells.

6.

Add polybrene (Sigma Aldrich, TR-1003-G) as described in subsection 4.4 for a final concentration of 5
ug/mL in each well.

7.

Incubate at 37 C for 48-60 hours before reading out luminescence or fluorescence as described in
subsection 4.4.

8.

Plot the data. For the curves shown in Figure 4, we fit and plotted the data using the neutcurve Python
package (https://jbloomlab.github.io/neutcurve/).

4.6 Human plasma sample and soluble ACE2.
The human plasma sample used in Figure 4A was collected at 19 days post-symptom onset from a patient with
a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prior to use, the plasma was heat-inactivated in a biosafety cabinet at 56 C
for one hour. This duration of heat treatment has been shown to be sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 [26,57],
which is also not reported to be present at high titers in the blood [58,59]. The negative control serum pools came
from Gemini Biosciences (Cat:100-110). The naïve serum pool collected in 2017-2018 is lot H86W03J. The agematched negative control serum comes from serum residuals collected by Bloodworks Northwest. It was
collected on 12/19/1989 and stored at -80 C.
Soluble human ACE2 protein fused to the Fc region of human IgG was produced as described in [28]. This
ACE2-Fc fusion protein was used in Figure 4B.
