Abstract

32
33

Rationale: Asthma is associated with chronic changes in the airway epithelium, a key target of

34

SARS-CoV-2. Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL-13, but the effects of

35

IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown.

36

Objectives: We sought to discover how IL-13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes

37

encoding SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs)

38

and determine whether IL-13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

39

Methods: We used bulk and single cell RNA-seq to identify cytokine-induced changes in SARS-

40

CoV-2-associated gene expression in HBECs. We related these to gene expression changes in

41

airway epithelium from individuals with mild-moderate asthma and chronic obstructive

42

pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs.

43

Measurements and Main Results: Transcripts encoding 332 of 342 (97%) SARS-CoV-2-

44

associated proteins were detected in HBECs (≥1 RPM in 50% samples). 41 (12%) of these

45

mRNAs were regulated by IL-13 (>1.5-fold change, FDR < 0.05). Many IL-13-regulated SARS-

46

CoV-2-associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD. IL-13 pretreatment

47

reduced viral RNA recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker

48

of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay. Mucus also inhibited viral

49

infection.

50

Conclusions: IL-13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARS-CoV-2 infection

51

through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons. Our findings

52

may help explain reports of relatively low prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with

53

COVID-19 and could lead to new strategies for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

59

One remarkable feature of the COVID-19 pandemic is the wide range of disease severity seen

60

following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Host factors, including age and male sex (1), inborn or

61

acquired disorders of type I interferon-mediated antiviral immunity (2–4), and various pre-

62

existing medical conditions (5) influence the risk of severe disease. There have been concerns

63

that COVID-19 risks would also be increased in persons with asthma, which affects

64

~339,000,000 individuals worldwide (6). These concerns arose from experience with other

65

respiratory viruses which trigger asthma exacerbations and can be associated with worse

66

outcomes in individuals with pre-existing asthma (7). However, asthma was underrepresented in

67

early studies of patients with COVID-19 as well as prior studies of the severe acute respiratory

68

syndrome (SARS) (8). Subsequent studies have failed to find consistent evidence of increased

69

risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, or mortality due to asthma (1, 9, 10), and some

70

studies concluded that risk of acquiring and being hospitalized for COVID-19 are lower in those

71

with asthma (10, 11). Factors that might provide protection against COVID-19 in individuals with

72

asthma (12–15) include increased attention to limiting viral exposure, younger age, absence of

73

co-morbidities, use of inhaled corticosteroids, and a variety of biological features of asthma,

74

including chronic airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and altered expression of SARS-

75

CoV-2 receptor (12). However, direct evidence that these features alter SARS-CoV-2 infection

76

has been lacking.

77

Asthma is associated with changes in the structure and function of the airway epithelium,

78

a critical site for SARS-CoV-2 infection (16, 17). Airway epithelial gene expression changes

79

attributable to the type 2 cytokine IL-13 are seen in approximately half of individuals with asthma

80

(18, 19). IL-13 stimulation of airway epithelial cells decreases expression of ACE2, which

81

encodes the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and increases expression of TMPRSS2, which encodes a

82

transmembrane protease that primes the viral spike protein (20–22). Similar changes are seen

83

in airways of individuals with type 2 high asthma (21, 22). IL-13 has also been reported to

84

protect against other RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (23) and

85

rhinovirus (24), that do not rely on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for entry, indicating that other IL-13-

86

regulated genes can also protect against viral infection. We therefore hypothesized that IL-13

87

induces changes in expression of airway epithelial cell genes important in SARS-CoV-2

88

infection in a large subset of individuals with asthma and that IL-13 reduces susceptibility of

89

these cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

Additional details are provided in the Online Data Supplement.

93
94

Human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) culture

95

Primary HBECs from 13 individuals listed in Table E1 were cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI)

96

as previously described (25, 26). For cytokine stimulation, cultures were stimulated by addition

97

of cytokines (10 ng/ml) to the basolateral medium (IFN-α: 24 hours, IFN-γ: 24 hours, IL-13: 7

98

days, IL-17: 7 days). The UCSF Committee on Human Research approved these studies.

99
100

RNA-seq

101

RNA was isolated from cytokine-stimulated HBECs derived from six individuals and bulk RNA-

102

seq was performed as previously described (27, 28). We previously reported other analyses

103

based upon data from unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with individual cytokines (27, 28);

104

data from cells treated with a combination of IL-13 and IFN-α have not been previously

105

reported. For scRNA-seq, single cell suspensions were generated from HBECs from four of the

106

donors used for bulk RNA-seq and analyzed using the 10X Genomics platform.

108

Analysis of gene expression in asthma and COPD

109

Using gene expression data from studies of asthma (27) and COPD (29) we correlated

110

measures of type 2 activity with IL-13-induced SARS-CoV-2-associated genes in HBECs using

111

Pearson’s correlation coefficient and a linear regression model that adjusted for age and sex.

112
113

SARS-CoV-2 infection

114

SARS-CoV-2 virus (USA-WA1/2020 strain) was provided by Dr. Melanie Ott and propagated in

115

Vero E6 cells. HBECs were cultured in the absence or presence of IL-13 (10 ng/ml). Mucus was

116

allowed to accumulate for 3 d or was removed immediately prior to viral infection by washing the

117

apical surface with a prewarmed solution of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT; Thermo) in PBS for 10

118

minutes (26) and then washing twice with PBS without DTT. Cells were inoculated by adding

119

virus to the apical surface. After 2 h, the apical surface was washed with twice with PBS and

120

cells were returned to the incubator. Cells were harvested 48 h post-infection for analysis of viral

121

RNA (by qRT-PCR) and dsRNA-staining (by immunofluorescence).

122
123

Results

124
125

SARS-CoV-2-associated host genes are highly expressed in HBECs

126

We compiled a list of 342 SARS-CoV-2-associated genes belonging to one of two gene sets.

127

One set of 11 genes encode proteins implicated in viral entry: ACE2 (30), TMPRSS2 (30), the

128

cathepsins CTSB and CTSL, FURIN(PCSK3), and the furin-like proteases PCSK1, PCSK2, and

129

PCSK4-7 (31). The second set of 332 genes encode host cell proteins shown to interact with

130

high confidence with 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in HEK293T cells (32). One gene,

131

PCSK6, belonged to both sets. Using bulk RNA-seq, we detected 332 of the 342 SARS-CoV-2-

132

associated genes (97%; ≥ 1 read per million mapped reads [RPM] in ≥50% of samples) in

differentiated HBECs cultured without cytokine (Table E2). SARS-CoV-2-associated genes were

134

substantially overrepresented among genes with high read counts (Fig. 1A).

135
136

IL-13 and other cytokines regulate expression of many SARS-CoV-2-associated genes

137

We examined the effect of IL-13 stimulation on SARS-CoV-2-associated gene expression. We

138

also analyzed the effects of IFN-α, which plays a central role in defense against SARS-CoV-2

139

infection (3, 4) and has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of a human lung epithelial

140

cell line (33), and IFN-γ (27) and IL-17 (34), each of which have been implicated in subsets of

141

individuals with asthma. Each cytokine had the expected effects on expression of known

142

cytokine-responsive genes (Figure 1B). Of the 332 SARS-CoV-2-associated genes detected in

143

HBECs, IL-13 regulated 41 genes, IFN-α regulated 19 genes, the combination of IL-13 and IFN-

144

α regulated 63 genes, IFN-γ regulated 14 genes, and IL-17 regulated 21 genes (false discovery

145

rate [FDR] q ≤ 0.05 and absolute fold change ≥ 1.5; Figure 1C; Table E2). ACE2 was reduced

146

by IL-13 (29% decrease, q = 0.003), consistent with a prior report (24). In contrast, ACE2 was

147

the most highly upregulated gene following stimulation with IFN-α (451% increase, q = 3 × 10-74)

148

or IFN-γ (185% increase, q = 9 × 10-29) and was less strongly upregulated following IL-17

149

stimulation (31% increase, q = 0.02). Analysis of ACE2 splicing confirmed prior reports that

150

interferon stimulation increased expression of the decoy isoform (35), but we found no

151

significant effect of IL-13 on levels of this isoform (mean decoy ACE2 normalized reads:

152

unstimulated, 62; IFN-α-stimulated: 588, IL-13-stimulated, 61). TMPRSS2 was increased by IL-

153

13 (61% increase, q = 7 × 10-15) and IL-17 (22% increase, q = 0.005) but modestly decreased

154

by IFN-α (17% decrease, q = 0.01) and IFN-γ (16% decrease, q = 0.03). No significant

155

correlation between IL-13- and IFN-α-induced changes in the 342 SARS-CoV-2-associated

156

genes was observed, and combined stimulation with both cytokines resulted in additive effects

157

with no evidence of synergy or antagonism (Figure E1). This suggests that these two cytokines

158

affect SARS-CoV-2-associated genes by different and independent mechanisms.

159
160

Expression of many SARS-CoV-2-associated genes differs between airway epithelial cell

161

types

162

We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to assess cell type-specific expression of

163

SARS-CoV-2-associated genes in unstimulated HBEC cultures from four individuals (Figure

164

E2). Of the 332 SARS-CoV-2-associated genes detected in HBECs by bulk RNA-seq, 322

165

(97%) were detected in at least 10 cells. We detected ACE2 in 1.7% of basal cells, 3.1% of

166

secretory cells, and 1.6% of ciliated cells from unstimulated HBEC cultures. 113 of the 322

167

SARS-CoV-2 genes detected in our scRNA-seq dataset were differentially expressed between

168

cell types (FDR q < 0.05; Table E3; selected genes shown in Fig. 2A). We found similar patterns

169

of epithelial cell subset-specific expression of these SARS-CoV-2 associated genes in a scRNA-

170

seq dataset from human bronchial tissue (36) (Figure E3), confirming that our cell culture model

171

recapitulated cell type-specific gene expression seen in vivo and that the expression of host cell

172

proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins differs between cell types.

173
174

IL-13 affects expression of some SARS-CoV-2-associated genes in a cell type-specific

175

manner

176

We explored the effect of cytokine stimulation on SARS-CoV-2 associated gene expression in

177

each cell type. Whereas many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2 associated genes were affected

178

similarly in each cell type, some IL-13 effects were cell type-specific, with 11 cases in which IL-

179

13 had opposite effects (increased in one cell type and decreased in another cell type, FDR q <

180

0.1 for both; Figure 2B and Table E3). Notably, IL-13 upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in

181

secretory cells, but decreased expression in ciliated cells. Cell type-specific effects of IL-13

182

could have implications for the outcome of infection in different airway epithelial subsets.

183
184

Type 2 signatures are associated with expression of many SARS-CoV-2-associated

185

genes in individuals with asthma and COPD

186

We examined whether IL-13-induced SARS-CoV-2-associated genes identified in HBECs in

187

culture were altered in asthma using a transcriptomic profiling dataset derived from

188

endobronchial brush biopsies from individuals with mild to moderate asthma and healthy

189

individuals (Mechanisms of Asthma STudy [MAST]) (27, 37). We used the three gene metric

190

(TGM), an established measure of IL-13-induced airway inflammation in individuals with asthma

191

(18, 19, 38), for this analysis. 24 of 27 SARS-CoV-2-associated genes induced by IL-13 in

192

HBECs were positively correlated with the TGM (Pearson’s R > 0); in 13 cases this correlation

193

was statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons (adjusted p < 0.05; Figure

194

3; Table E4). 16 of 27 IL-13-induced genes were significantly associated with the TGM using a

195

linear model that included age and sex (adjusted p < 0.05; Table E4).

196

A study of former smokers with and without COPD found that subsets of individuals with

197

COPD also have airway epithelial gene expression changes indicative of type 2 inflammation

198

(39). 26 SARS-CoV-2-associated genes induced by IL-13 in HBECs were measured in that

199

study, and 21 of those positively correlated with the type 2 gene expression score developed for

200

that study (Pearson’s R > 0). In 16 cases this association was statistically significant (adjusted p

201

< 0.05) and remained so in a model that included age and sex (Figure E4; Table E4). Taken

202

together, our data indicate that many IL-13-induced SARS-CoV-2-associated gene changes

203

seen in the HBEC culture model recapitulate alterations seen in epithelial cells from individuals

204

with asthma or COPD and type 2 inflammation.

205
206

IL-13 protects HBECs from SARS-CoV-2 infection

207

We next investigated whether stimulation with IL-13 protected HBECs from SARS-CoV-2

208

infection by quantifying viral RNA 48 h after viral inoculation. Mucus produced by HBECs was

209

left in place or was removed by washing the apical surface immediately prior to inoculation. In

210

the first experiment, we found that the presence of mucus decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-

211

2 RNA detected after infection of unstimulated cells by 74% compared with cells infected after

212

removal of mucus (Fig. 4A). Pre-stimulation with IL-13 markedly reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2

213

RNA when infections were performed after removal of mucus (95% reduction) and when cells

214

were infected in the presence of mucus (97% reduction). In a second experiment with a different

215

HBEC donor (Fig. 4B), mucus was more effective in inhibiting infection (90-97% reduction for

216

three different viral inocula). In cells infected after removal of mucus, IL-13 pre-stimulation

217

reduced viral RNA by 82-92%. Since both mucus and IL-13 pre-stimulation had large effects in

218

this donor, it was not clear whether mucus and IL-13 had additive effects in this experiment.

219

We also assessed the effects of mucus and IL-13 on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA),

220

which is produced during SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. dsRNA was not detected in uninfected

221

cells but was detected within isolated cells or clusters of cells in unstimulated SARS-CoV-2-

222

infected cultures. Analysis of cultures inoculated with varying amounts of virus after removal of

223

mucus revealed a total of 27 dsRNA-stained foci with a mean volume of 6958 µm3 (Fig. 5). In

224

contrast, only 3 foci (mean 1246 µm3) were seen in paired cultures inoculated without removing

225

mucus (Fig. E5). In cultures pre-stimulated with IL-13, no foci were observed whether or not

226

mucus was removed. The observation that relatively small amounts of viral RNA were

227

detectable in IL-13-stimulated cultures (Fig. 4) but dsRNA staining was not evident under these

228

conditions (Fig. 5 and Fig. E5) might indicate that dsRNA staining is less sensitive than qRT-

229

PCR for viral RNA. Alternatively, it is possible that IL-13 completely prevented viral replication,

230

and that viral RNA detected in IL-13-stimulated cells was residual RNA from the viral inoculum.

231

Most dsRNA-containing infected cells co-stained for the ciliated cell marker acetylated-α-tubulin,

232

although dsRNA was occasionally seen in non-ciliated cells that stained for mucins. Since PCR

233

analysis of viral RNA indicated that the protective effects of mucus were greater in donor 2, it is

234

noteworthy that mucin expression differed between the two donors. In the absence of IL-13,

235

donor 1 cultures had MUC5B-containing cells but no detectable MUC5AC-containing cells (Fig.

236

5A and Fig. E5A), whereas donor 2 cultures had both MUC5AC- and MUC5B-containing cells

237

(Fig. 5B and Fig. E5B). IL-13 stimulation increased MUC5AC in cells from both donors and

238

caused an obvious decrease in MUC5B in donor 1; these effects of IL-13 are consistent with

239

those observed in our previous studies (25) and people with type 2 asthma (19). Based on viral

240

RNA measurements and dsRNA staining, we conclude that both the presence of a mucus gel

241

and IL-13 stimulation reduced viral infection, and that the effects of IL-13 were seen even after

242

removal of the mucus layer prior to infection.

243
244

Discussion

245

Our studies reveal that IL-13 stimulation of HBECs affects expression of many SARS-CoV-2-

246

associated genes and substantially inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cells. Genes

247

encoding the large majority of SARS-CoV-2-interacting proteins identified in a previous study of

248

HEK293T cells were expressed in HBECs. Expression of many SARS-CoV-2-associated genes

249

differed between basal, ciliated, and secretory cells, potentially affecting how these cell types

250

respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many IL-13-induced SARS-CoV-2-associated gene

251

expression changes we detected in culture were also seen in bronchial epithelium obtained

252

directly from individuals with type 2 high asthma. This provides a plausible mechanism for

253

protection against COVID-19, although the impact of asthma on COVID-19 risk is still

254

incompletely understood and other factors may also influence COVID-19 risk in individuals with

255

asthma (13–16). We also found significant associations of many IL-13-induced SARS-CoV-2-

256

associated genes with type 2 inflammation in a large group of smokers with and without COPD,

257

suggesting that the effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 risk may also be relevant in some

258

259

different than the effects of IFN-α, suggesting that these two cytokines induce different antiviral

260

mechanisms. In experiments that established the inhibitory effect of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2

261

infection of epithelial cells, we found evidence that another barrier component, the mucus gel,

262

also provides protection against infection. Taken together, these studies provide insights into

263

airway epithelial responses that can protect against SARS-CoV-2 and might influence COVID-

264

19 susceptibility and severity in individuals with asthma or other airway diseases.

265

IL-13 had a substantial effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs as demonstrated by

266

measurements of viral RNA and dsRNA following viral inoculation. Prior studies report a variety

267

of effects of asthma and IL-13 on development of illnesses caused by other viruses. IL-13 can

268

increase susceptibility of HBECs to rhinovirus infection by suppressing induction of interferons

269

(40–42), although another study reported that prolonged pre-treatment with IL-13 of HBECs

270

reduced rhinovirus infection (24). Mice with acute allergic airway inflammation (43) and people

271

with pre-existing asthma (44) are reportedly protected from H1N1 influenza. Studies in IL-13-

272

overexpressing transgenic mice and IL-13-deficient mice showed that IL-13 reduced respiratory

273

syncytial virus replication and severity of illness (23). While effects of IL-13 on the airway

274

epithelium are an important contributor to asthma pathogenesis, it is intriguing to speculate that

275

IL-13 responses may have evolved at least in part to provide protection against viral infections.

276

The finding that levels of IL-13 and the related type 2 cytokine IL-4 were higher in patients with

277

moderate COVID-19 compared with severe COVID-19 or healthy controls is also consistent with

278

an antiviral role for these cytokines (45).

279

Many mechanisms might account for IL-13-driven inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A

280

recent study identified 65 interferon-stimulated genes that mediate restriction of SARS-CoV-2

281

infection (46), illustrating how a single cytokine can activate a large set of antiviral pathways.

282

We found that gene expression changes induced by IL-13 were quite distinct from those

283

induced by IFN-α, suggesting that these cytokines activate different antiviral pathways. We

284

confirmed prior studies (20, 21) showing that IL-13 induced a decrease in expression of the

11

285

SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, which could contribute to decreased infection. However, the

286

reduction in ACE2 expression was modest compared with the effects of IL-13 on infection,

287

suggesting that other IL-13 effects should also be considered. As in the previous reports, we

288

found that IL-13 increased expression of TMPRSS2, a protease that is important for viral entry.

289

However, we found that the IL-13 effects were cell type-dependent: TMPRSS2 expression was

290

increased in secretory cells but decreased in ciliated cells. Since ciliated cells were the primary

291

cell type infected in our experiments, it is possible that decreased TMPRSS2 in ciliated cells

292

contributed to an overall reduction in infection. Many other host cell factors influence viral entry,

293

RNA synthesis and translation, and egress, and further studies will be required to determine

294

which of these contribute to the antiviral effects of IL-13.

295

Our studies provided clear evidence that the mucus barrier produced by HBECs in cell

296

culture inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Airway mucus is a complex hydrogel that derives its

297

characteristic viscoelastic properties from the mucin glycoproteins MUC5B and MUC5AC (47).

298

Prior studies establish that mucins play important roles as restriction factors for other viruses,

299

including influenza (48, 49). We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was decreased when mucus

300

gels were left in place at the time of viral inoculation. We studied two subjects with distinct

301

patterns of mucin expression and found somewhat different levels of protection from the gel.

302

While further studies are clearly required to investigate this further, this result suggests that

303

differences in mucus gels are also likely to be important in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in

304

airway mucus volume, composition, and organization are prominent features of many airway

305

diseases, including asthma (47). IL-13 is an important regulator of mucins, and we speculate

306

that IL-13-driven increases in MUC5AC, which results in tethering of the mucus gel to the

307

epithelium (25), might contribute to IL-13-induced inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However,

308

this is unlikely to completely account for the antiviral effect since IL-13 inhibited viral infection

309

even when the mucus gel was removed immediately prior to inoculation.

310

Our study has some important limitations. While we focused on a set of SARS-CoV-2-

311

associated genes that have been defined in previous studies, other IL-13-regulated genes are

312

also likely to be important for anti-viral effects. Some IL-13-regulated genes we identified in cell

313

culture were not associated with a type 2 signature in cells from individuals with asthma or

314

COPD, reflecting the influence of other factors, including other asthma mediators, or differences

315

in IL-13 responses in cell culture versus in vivo. As individual genes that contribute to inhibition

316

of viral infection in HBECs are identified, it will be important to specifically examine the

317

expression of those genes in asthma and COPD. Our HBEC infection studies used only one

318

strain of SARS-CoV-2 and cells from only two donors, and further experiments with additional

319

strains and more donors (including donors with asthma), will be required to better understand

320

the interactions between virus, epithelial cells, and IL-13. Finally, our infection model focuses

321

solely on the role of epithelial cells, but the effects of IL-13 on other cell types found in the lung

322

are also deserving of further study.

323

In conclusion, we found that the central asthma mediator IL-13 has a strong inhibitory

324

effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs. The mechanisms that account for this effect are

325

unknown, but widespread effects of IL-13 on expression of SARS-CoV-2 associated genes that

326

are distinct from those induced by interferons suggest that some of these mechanisms may be

327

novel. While the use of IL-13 itself as a therapeutic may well be prevented by the pro-asthmatic

328

effects of this cytokine, identification of IL-13-induced antiviral pathways could help address the

329

urgent need for development of novel targeted treatments for COVID-19.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2-associated genes are highly expressed in HBECs and many are

530

regulated by cytokines. HBECs from six donors were cultured without cytokine (–), or with IL-

531

13, IFN-α, a combination of IL-13 and IFN-α, IFN-γ, or IL-17 and analyzed by RNA-seq. (A)

532

Comparison of read counts between SARS-CoV-2 associated genes, including ACE2 and

533

TMPRSS2, and all detected genes (≥1 read per million mapped reads in ≥50% of samples) in

534

unstimulated HBECs. (B, C) Heatmap illustrating canonical cytokine-regulated genes (B), and

535

cytokine regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes (C; FDR q ≤ 0.05; absolute fold change ≥ 1.5

536

for any cytokine).

Figure 2. scRNA-seq reveals cell type-specific expression of many SARS-CoV-2-

539

associated genes and cell type-specific effects of IL-13. (A) Cell type-specific expression in

540

unstimulated HBECs. Genes were selected from a set of 113 differentially expressed SARS-

541

CoV-2-associated genes listed in Table E3. (B) Cell type-specific differences in IL-13

542

responses. For 11 SARS-CoV-2-associated genes, IL-13 increased expression in at least one

543

cell type and decreased expression in at least one other cell type (FDR q < 0.1 for both). Gene

544

expression was determined by aggregating data from all cells from experiments with four

545

donors. Coloring of each dot indicates expression level relative to other cell types (A) or in IL-

546

13-stimulated cells compared with unstimulated cells (B). The size of each dot is proportional to

547

the percentage of cells with at least one read mapped to the gene, and black circles at the

548

perimeter of each dot indicate that expression levels are significantly different (q < 0.1)

549

compared to other cell types (A) or in IL-13-stimulated compared to unstimulated cells of the

550

same type (B).

Figure 3. Expression of many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes correlates

553

with an IL-13 signature in asthma. Correlation of IL-13-induced, SARS-CoV-2 associated

554

genes with a type 2/IL-13 signature (the three gene metric, TGM) in endobronchial brushing

555

samples from participants with asthma (red) and healthy controls (cyan). Values for gene

556

expression represent log2 of normalized read counts from bulk RNA-seq. The eight SARS-CoV-

557

2 genes with the highest Pearson’s correlations (R) are shown and associated P values are

558

adjusted for multiple comparisons. Correlations for the full set of IL-13-induced SARS-CoV-2-

559

associated genes are shown in Table E4.

Figure 4. IL-13 stimulation and mucus reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA levels in infected

562

HBECs. (A) HBECs from a single donor were left unstimulated (–) or stimulated with IL-13 (+),

563

washed with a DTT-containing solution (Mucus Removed) or left unwashed (Mucus Intact), and

564

inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (0.3 plaque forming units [pfu] based on titration in Vero E6 cells).

565

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was measured 48 h after infection. (b) In a second experiment, cells from

566

a different donor were studied using the same protocol, except that three different inocula (0.3,

567

1.0, and 1.3 pfu) from another virus preparation were used. Each point represents a separate

568

Transwell culture (n = 3 per condition except as shown). **, p < 0.01; *** p < 0.0001 for the

569

effects of IL-13 by ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post-tests. For cells not stimulated with IL-13,

570

viral RNA load was lower in infections performed with mucus intact compared with infections

571

performed with mucus removed (p < 0.0001 for all viral inocula in both experiments, except for p

572

= 0.01 for the 0.3 pfu inoculum in the second experiment, by ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post-

573

tests). For viral RNA, 1 unit represents the amount of viral RNA present in 1 pfu from the viral

574

stock, based on titration in Vero E6 cells.

579

stained with antibodies against dsRNA (yellow); the ciliated cell marker acetylated alpha tubulin

580

(Ac-α-tubulin) and DAPI (both imaged in the same channel, purple); MUC5B (red); and
