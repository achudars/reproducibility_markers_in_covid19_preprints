Abstract: Although human antibodies elicited by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome

32

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein are profoundly boosted upon infection,

33

little is known about the function of N-directed antibodies. Herein, we isolated and profiled a panel

34

of 32 N protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from a quick recovery coronavirus disease-

35

19 (COVID-19) convalescent, who had dominant antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 N protein

36

rather than to Spike protein. The complex structure of N protein RNA binding domain with the

37

highest binding affinity mAb nCoV396 reveals the epitopes and antigen’s allosteric changes.

38

Functionally, a virus-free complement hyper-activation analysis demonstrates that nCoV396

39

specifically compromises N protein-induced complement hyper-activation, a risk factor for

40

morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, thus paving the way for functional anti-N mAbs

41

identification.

Main Text

43

The fatality rate of the critical condition Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is

44

exceptionally high, at 40% - 49%(1, 2). Acute respiratory failure and generalized coagulopathy

45

are significant aspects associated with morbidity and mortality(3-5). A subset of severe COVID-

46

19 patients has distinct clinical features compared to classic acute respiratory distress syndrome

47

(ARDS), with delayed onset of respiratory distress(6) and relatively well-preserved lung

48

mechanics despite the severity of hypoxemia(7). It is reported that complement-mediated

49

thrombotic microvascular injury in the lung may contribute to atypical ARDS features of COVID-

50

19, accompanied by extensive deposition of the alternative pathway (AP) and lectin pathway (LP)

51

complement components(8). Indeed, complement activation is found in multiple organs of severe

52

COVID-19 patients in several other studies(9, 10), as well as in patients with severe acute

53

respiratory distress syndrome (SARS)(11, 12). A recent retrospective observational study of

54

11,116 patients revealed that complement disorder associated with morbidity and mortality of

55

COVID-19(13).

56

Although systemic activation of complement plays a pivotal role in protective immunity against

57

pathogens, hyper-activation of complement may lead to collateral tissue injury. Severe acute

58

respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein

59

is a highly immunopathogenic and multifunctional viral protein(14-19), which elicited high titers

60

of binding antibodies in humoral immune responses(20-22). A recent preprint study found that

61

SARS-CoV-2 N protein bound to LP complement components MASP-2 (Mannan binding lectin-

62

associated serine protease-2), and resulted in complement hyper-activation and aggravated

63

inflammatory lung injury(15). Several studies have reported in isolations of human monoclonal

64

antibodies (mAbs) targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, shedding the light of developing

65

therapeutic interventions of COVID-19(20, 23-27). However, little is known about the potential

66

therapeutic applications of N protein-targeting mAbs in the convalescent B cell repertoire. Herein,

67

we report a human mAb derived from COVID-19 convalescent, with specific targeting to SARS-

68

CoV-2 N protein and functionally compromising complement hyper-activation ex vivo.

69

Isolation of N protein-directed mAbs

70

To profile antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 N protein in early recovered patients, we collected

71

six convalescent blood samples at seven to 25 days after the onset of the disease symptoms. All

72

patients are recovered from COVID-19 during the outbreak in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province,

73

China, with age ranging from 23 to 66 years old (Table S1). The SARS-CoV-2 nasal swabs reverse

74

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were confirmed being negative at the

75

points of blood collection for all of these six COVID-19 patients. Plasma samples and peripheral

76

blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated for serological analysis and antibody isolation.

77

Serum antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were measured by enzyme-linked

78

immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Fig. 1A, B, Table S1). Serologic analysis demonstrated that

79

serum antibody titers to the N protein were substantially higher than to the S protein in most of the

80

patients. For example, ZD004 and ZD006 had only minimal levels of antibody response to the S

81

protein, while they had much higher antibody titers to the N protein. To be noted, the time from

82

the disease onset to complete recovery from clinical symptoms of COVID19 patient ZD006 was

83

only 9 days (Table S1).

84

To take advantage of patient ZD006 that was still in the early recovery phase with high possibility

85

of high percentage of antigen-specific plasma cells, single plasma cells (Fig. 1C) with phenotype

86

of CD3-/CD14-/CD16-/CD235a-/CD19+/CD20low-neg/CD27hi/CD38hi, as well as antigen-specific

87

memory B cells with phenotype of CD19+/CD27+ (Fig. 1D) were sorted from PBMC of patient

88

ZD006 by fluorescence activating cell sorter (FACS). To ensure an unbiased assessment, the

89

sorting of antigen-specific memory B cells was carried out with combined probes of both

90

fluorophore-labeled S and N recombinant proteins. Variable region of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-

91

and light-chain gene segment (VH and VL) pairs from the sorted single cells were amplified by RT-

92

PCR, sequenced, annotated and expressed as recombinant mAbs using the methods as described

93

previously(28). Recombinant mAbs were screened against SARS-COV-2 S and N proteins. In

94

total, we identified 32 mAbs reacted with SARS-COV2 N protein including 20 mAbs from plasma

95

cells, and 12 mAbs from memory B cells (Table S2). We found that IgG1 is the predominant

96

isotype at 46.9% followed by IgG3 (25.0%), IgA (18.8%), IgG2 (6.3%) and IgM (3.1) (Fig.1E).

97

VH gene family usage in SARs-COV2 N protein-reactive antibodies was 18.8% VH1, 62.5% VH3,

98

9.4% VH4, 6.2% VH5 and 3.1% VH7, respectively (Fig. 1F), which was similar to the distribution

99

of VH families collected in the NCBI database. Nine of 32 SARS-COV-2 N protein-reactive

100

antibodies had no mutation from their germline VH and VH gene segments (Fig. 1F, Table S2).

101

Average mutation frequency of the remaining mutated antibodies was 5.3 % (+/-3.6%) in VH and

102

3.5% (+/-2.7%) in VL.

103

In consistent with the lower serum antibody titers to SARS-COV-2 S protein, we identified only

104

eight SARS-COV-2 S protein-reactive mAbs including 5 antibodies from plasma cells and three

105

antibodies from memory B cells. VH gene segment of the S protein-reactive antibodies had either

106

no mutation (6/8) or minimal mutation (1/300) (Fig.1G). There were no significant differences in

107

complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length in amino acid residues between the N-

108

(Fig.1H) and S-reactive antibodies (Fig.1I).

109

Approximately a quarter portion of antibodies directed to the N protein (Fig.1F) and almost all of

110

antibodies to the S protein that had no mutation or minimal mutations from their germlines (Fig.1G)

111

reflected as primary antibody response similar to other typical primary viral infections. However,

112

relatively high VH mutation frequencies (mean of 5.7%) of the majority antibodies to the N proteins

113

were more similar to mutation frequencies of antibodies from the secondary responses to influenza

114

vaccination reported previously. Although patient ZD006 was hospitalized for only nine days after

115

the first appearance of COVID-19 symptoms, the patient has high serum antibody titers and the

116

majority of the isolated N-reactive antibodies have high mutation frequency, whereas the S-

117

directed antibodies have no mutation or minimal mutation. These results reflect much stronger

118

antigen stimulation to the host driven by SARS-COV2 N protein than by the S protein.

119

Binding characterizations of anti-N mAbs

120

To determine the antigenic targets by the N-reactive antibodies, we next analyzed the binding

121

activities by ELISA with variant constructs of the N protein (N-FL: 1-419; N-NTD: 41-174; N-

122

CTD: 250-364) (Fig. 2A). Among 32 mAbs binding to NFL; 13 antibodies bound to N-NTD; one

123

antibody bound to N-CTD (Fig. 2B). Total of nine antibodies including one antibody (nCoV400)

124

recognizing N-CTD, seven mAbs binding N-NTD (nCoV396, nCoV416, nCoV424, nCoV425,

125

nCoV433, nCoV454, nCoV457) and one mAb (nCoV402) binding only to NFL but not to the other

126

variant N proteins were chosen as representatives for further study. Purified antibodies were

127

confirmed to bind the NFL protein by ELISA (Fig. 2C). Affinity of these antibodies to the NFL

128

protein was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 2D). In an effort to further

129

characterize the function and structure relationship, three antibodies nCoV396, nCOV416 and

130

nCOV457 were selected for production of recombinant Fab antibodies based on their unique

131

characters. MAb nCoV396 has VH mutation frequency of 2.8%, but high binding affinity with KD

132

of 1.02 nM (Fig. 2D) to the N protein. MAbs nCOV416 and nCOV457 have high VH mutation at

133

11.1% and 8.7%, respectively, and have binding affinity to N protein with KD of 7.26 nM and

134

12.6 nM (Fig.2D, Table S3).

135

Complex structure of mAb with N-NTD

136

To investigate the molecular interaction mechanism of mAb nCoV396 with N protein, we next

137

solved the complex structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD (N-NTD) with nCoV396 Fab

138

fragments (nCoV396Fab) at 2.1 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. The final structure is fitted

139

with visible electron density spanning residues 49-173 (SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), 1-220

140

(nCoV396Fab, the heavy chain of Fab fragments), and 1-213 (nCoV396Fab, the light chain of Fab

141

fragments, except residues ranged 136-141), respectively. The complete statistics for data

142

collection, phasing, and refinement are presented in Table S4.

143

With the help of the high-resolution structure, we were able to designate all complementarity

144

determining regions (CDRs) in the nCoV396Fab as L-CDR1 (light chain CDR1, residues 23-32),

145

L-CDR2 (light chain CDR2, residues 51-54), L-CDR3 (light chain CDR3, residues 94-100), H-

146

CDR1 (heavy chain CDR1, residues 26-33), H-CDR2 (heavy chain CDR2, residues 51-57), and

147

H-CDR3 (heavy chain CDR3, residues 99-108). Among them, we identified the interaction

148

interface between N-NTD and L-CDR1, L-CDR3, H-CDR1, H-CDR2, H-CDR3 of nCoV396Fab

149

with unambiguous electron density map (Fig. 3A, Fig. S1A).

150

The interacting CDRs pinch the C-terminal tail of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD (residues range from 159

151

to 172), with extensive binding contacts of 1079 Å2 burying surface area (Table S5). Light chain

152

L-CDR1 and L-CDR3 of nCoV396Fab interact with residues ranging from 159-163 of N-NTD via

153

numerous hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 3B, Fig. S1B). Of note, SARS-CoV-2 N-

154

NTD residue Q163 is recognized by L-CDR3 residue T95 via a hydrogen bond, simultaneously

155

stacking with L-CDR3 residue W96 and L-CDR1 residue Y31 (Fig. 3C). Besides, a network of

156

interactions from heavy chain H-CDR2, H-CDR3 of nCoV396Fab to residues 165-172 of N-NTD

157

suggests that SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD conservative residue K169 has a critical role in nCoV396

158

antibody binding. The K169 is recognized via hydrogen bonds with residues E99 d-carboxyl group

159

and T100, D102, S105 main-chain carbonyl groups inside the H-CDR3 of nCoV396Fab (Fig. 3D).

160

Besides, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD L167 also interacts with I33, V50, N57, and A59 of H-CDR1 and

161

H-CDR2 of nCoV396Fab through hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, all three

162

residues (Q163, L167, and K169) of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD are relatively conserved in the highly

163

pathogenic betacoronavirus N protein (Fig. S2B), which implicated that the nCoV396 may cross-

164

interact with SARS-CoV N protein or MERS-CoV N protein. Indeed, the binding affinities

165

measured by SPR analysis demonstrate that nCoV396 interacts to SARS-CoV N protein and

166

MERS-CoV N protein with KD of 7.4 nM (Fig. S2B, C).

167

To discover the conformational changes between the SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD apo-state with the

168

antibody-bound state, we next superimposed the complex structure with the N-NTD structure

169

(PDB:6M3M)(17). The superimposition result suggests that the C-terminal tail of SARS-CoV-2

170

N-NTD unfold from the basic palm region upon the nCoV396Fab binding (Fig. 3F), which likely

171

contributes to allosteric regulation of normal full-length N protein’s function. Additionally,

172

nCoV396Fab binding results in a 7.4 Å movement of the b-finger region outward from the RNA

173

binding pocket, which may enlarge the RNA binding pocket of the N protein (Fig. 3F).

174

To sum up, our crystal structural data demonstrated that the human mAb nCoV396 recognizes the

175

SARS-CoV-2 N protein via a pinching model, resulting in a dramatic conformational change of

176

residues ranged from 159 to 172, which is the linker region of N-NTD connected with other

177

domains.

MAb curbs N-induced complement activation

179

Although a recent study suggests that complement cascade is hyperactive by N protein in lungs of

180

COVID-19 patients via lectin pathway(15), it is unclear how to develop a virus-free and effective

181

system for analyzing the role of SARS-CoV-2 N protein on complement hyper-activation. To this

182

end, we developed a clinical autoimmune disease serum-based protease enzymatic approach to

183

assess complement activation level in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Since complement

184

activation initiated by lectin pathway is featured with MASP-2 proteases by specific activity for

185

cleaving complement component 2 and 4 (C2 and C4)(29), we designed a complement component

186

2 (C2) internal quenched fluorescent peptide-based analysis route for ex vivo complement hyper-

187

activation (Fig. 4A). Briefly, serum was collected from peripheral blood of the volunteers with

188

autoimmune disease, which contains necessary components for complement activations

189

characterized by elevated levels of C3 value (Table S6). Next, we collected the fluorescence signal

190

from cleaved C2 synthetic peptide substrates (2Abz-SLGRKIQI-Lys(Dnp)-NH2) in reaction

191

mixtures containing autoimmune disease serum, via in the absence or presence of SARS-CoV-2

192

N protein with or without mAb nCoV396. The initial reaction rate (v0) was estimated at a single

193

concentration of individual sera from duplicate measurements over a range of substrate

194

concentrations. The steady-state reaction constants Vmax (maximal velocity) and Km (Michaelis

195

constant) were determined for comparisons (Fig. 4A).

196

As shown in Fig. 4B, the calculated Vmax of reactions without any other exogenous proteins is 1.49

197

RU·s-1. Additions of SARS-CoV-2 N protein (concentrations ranged 0.5 µM to 10 µM) in the

198

reactions remarkably elevate the Vmax up to 2 folds, ranged from 2.37 ~ 3.02 RU·s-1. Similarly,

199

additions of SARS-CoV-2 N protein lead to approximate 1.8 folds increasing of the Vmax/Km values,

200

which suggested that the specificity constant (Kcat/Km) of MASP-2 to substrates is increased in the

201

presence of viral N protein as the enzyme concentrations are equivalent among the reactions

202

(Table S7 - S8). To confirm the kinetic analyses, Hanes plots ([S]/V versus [S]) were also drawn

203

and found to be linear (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the additions of SARS-CoV-2 N protein do not change

204

the single substrate binding site characterization of the enzymatic reactions. To assess the

205

suppression ability of nCoV396 to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein-induced complement hyper-

206

activation function, we next conducted the complement hyper-activation analysis in serial N

207

protein: nCoV396 ratios. As shown in Fig. 4D, the addition of N protein elevates Vmax value up to

208

40-folds (1:0 ratio), whereas the additions of antibody nCoV396 decline the Vmax in a dose-

209

depended manner (Table S9). To further validate the function of nCoV396, we next perform

210

complement hyper-activation analysis in other five serum samples from autoimmune disease

211

donors. Consistently, the Vmax of reactions are boosted in the presence of N protein in all samples,

212

while declined in the presence of mAb nCoV396 together with N protein (Fig. 4E). In conclusion,

213

these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of inducing the complement

214

hyper-activations ex vivo, not only by facilitating the maximal velocity of MASP-2 catalytic

215

activity, but also enhancing the substrate binding specificity in the reactions. The N-directed mAb

216

nCoV396 specifically compromises the SARS-CoV-2 N protein-induced complement hyper-

217

activation within clinical serum samples.

218

Discussion

219

From a quickly recovered COVID-19 patient, we isolated 32 mAbs specifically targeting to SARS-

220

CoV-2 N protein. The binding affinity of mAbs ranged from 1 nM to 25 nM, comparable with

221

mature spike protein-directed antibodies(20, 23-27) and the other mature antibodies identified

222

during acute infections(30, 31). Characteristics of the isolated N-reactive mAbs are different from

223

the isolated S-reactive mAbs in the early recovery COVID-19 patients suggested that sampling

224

time is pivotal for identifying differential immune responses to different SARS-CoV-2 viral

225

proteins.

226

The crystal structure of nCoV396 bound to SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD elucidates the interaction

227

mechanism of the complex between the first reported N protein-directed human mAb and its

228

targeted N protein. Three conservative amino acids (Q163, L167, K169) in N protein are

229

responsible for nCoV396 recognition, which provided a clue of cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV or

230

MERS-CoV N protein for nCoV396. Intriguingly, the nCoV396 binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD

231

undergoes several conformational changes, resulting in a change in N-NTD RNA binding pocket

232

enlargement and partial unfolding of basic palm region. More importantly, this conformational

233

change occurs in the C-terminal tail of the N-NTD, which may alter the positioning of individual

234

domains in context of full-length protein and lead to a potential allosteric effect for protein

235

functions.

236

Complement is one of the first lines of defense in innate immunity and is essential for cellular

237

integrity, tissue homeostasis, and modifying the adaptive immune response(32). Emerging

238

evidence suggests that the complement system plays a vital role in a subset of COVID-19 critical

239

patients, with features of atypical acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular

240

coagulation, and multiple organs failure(9, 10, 33). A few pieces of evidence show that highly

241

pathogenic coronavirus (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) N protein is involved in the initiated

242

MASP-2 dependent complement activation(15, 34). Encouragingly, COVID-19 critical patients

243

treated with complement inhibitors, including small molecules to complement component C3

244

(AMY-101) and antibody targeting to complement component C5 (Eculizumab), show remarkable

245

therapeutic outcomes(15). Currently, there are 11 clinical trials relative to targeting the

246

complement component targeting therapy, a viral protein-specific approach is warranted. The

248

antibody nCoV396 isolated from COVID-19 convalescents is an excellent potential candidate with

249

high binding affinity to N protein and high potency to inhibit the complement hyper-activation. As

250

revealed by atomic structural information, the binding may allosterically change the full-length N

251

protein conformation. To determine the role of nCoV396 in the suppression of complement hyper-

252

activation, we monitor the MASP-2 protease activity based on its specific fluorescent quenched

253

C2 substrate in serums from autoimmune disease patients. The complete complement components

254

in sera of patients with autoimmune disorders allow us to monitor the activating effects of SARS-

255

CoV-2 N protein and its specific mAbs. Although we cannot calculate the other steady-state

256

enzymatic reaction constants as the precisely concentration of MASP-2 in serum is unknown, we

257

identified the Vmax of the specific C2 substrate for the enzymatic reaction. We demonstrated that

258

SARS-CoV-2 N protein elevated the Vmax of the reaction, up to 40 folds, in serum of all 7

259

individuals tested, while nCoV396 effectively suppress Vmax of the reaction mixture. These results

260

indicated that the autoimmune disease patient serum-based complement activation analysis is a

261

virus-free and effective method for examining complement activation mediated by coronavirus N

262

protein.

263

Although precise interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N protein with MASP-2 remains to be elucidated,

264

our work defined the region on the SARS-CoV-2 N protein recognized by mAb nCoV396 that

265

plays an important role on complement hyper-activation, and indicates that human mAbs from the

266

convalescents could be a promising potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of COVID-
