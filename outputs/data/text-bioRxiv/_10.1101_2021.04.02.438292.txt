Abstract:
In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe

41

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more severe outcomes are reported in

42

males compared with females, including hospitalizations and deaths. Animal models can provide

43

an opportunity to mechanistically interrogate causes of sex differences in the pathogenesis of

44

SARS-CoV-2. Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8-10 weeks of age) were

45

inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at

46

several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the

47

infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male

48

hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developing

49

more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovering more slowly

50

than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage. Virus

51

titers in respiratory tissues, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, and pulmonary

52

cytokine concentrations, including IFN and TNF, were comparable between the sexes.

53

However, during the recovery phase of infection, females mounted two-fold greater IgM, IgG,

54

and IgA responses against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (S-RBD) in both

55

plasma and respiratory tissues. Female hamsters also had significantly greater IgG antibodies

56

against whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and mutant S-RBDs, as well as virus neutralizing

57

antibodies in plasma. The development of an animal model to study COVID-19 sex differences

58

will allow for a greater mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 associated sex

59

differences seen in the human population.

Importance:

63

Men experience more severe outcomes from COVID-19 than women. Golden Syrian hamsters

64

were used to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of a human clinical isolate of SARS-

65

CoV-2. After inoculation, male hamsters experienced greater sickness, developed more severe

66

lung pathology, and recovered more slowly than females. Sex differences in disease could not be

67

reversed by estradiol treatment in males and were not explained by either virus replication

68

kinetics or the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. During the recovery

69

period, antiviral antibody responses in the respiratory tract and plasma, including to newly

70

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, were greater in females than male hamsters. Greater lung

71

pathology during the acute phase combined with reduced antiviral antibody responses during the

72

recovery phase of infection in males than females illustrate the utility of golden Syrian hamsters

73

as a model to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine-induced

74

immunity and protection.

Introduction
At the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, early publications

77

from Wuhan, China (1, 2) and European countries (3) began reporting male biases in

78

hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality rates. Ongoing real-time

79

surveillance (4) and meta-analyses of over 3 million cases of COVID-19 (5) continue to show

80

that while the incidence of COVID-19 cases are similar between the sexes, adult males are

81

almost 3-times more likely to be admitted into ICUs and twice as likely to die as females.

82

Differential exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is

83

likely associated with behaviors, occupations, comorbidities and societal and cultural norms (i.e.,

84

gender differences) that impact the probability of exposure, access to testing, utilization of

85

healthcare, and risk of disease (6-8). This is distinct but also complementary to biological sex

86

differences (i.e., sex chromosome complement, reproductive tissues, and sex steroid hormone

87

concentrations) that can also impact susceptibility and outcomes from COVID-19 (9, 10). While

88

exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may differ based on gender, the increased mortality rate among males

89

in diverse countries and at diverse ages likely reflect biological sex. Studies have shown that in

90

males, mutations in X-linked genes (e.g., TLR7) resulting in reduced interferon signaling (11),

91

elevated proinflammatory cytokine production (e.g., IL-6 and CRP) (2, 12), reduced CD8+ T cell

92

activity (e.g., IFN-) (13), and greater antibody responses (i.e., anti-SARS-CoV-2 antigen-

93

specific IgM, IgG, and IgA, and neutralizing antibodies) (14) are associated with more severe

94

COVID-19 outcomes as compared with females. Because COVID-19 outcomes can be impacted

95

by both gender and biological sex, consideration of the intersection of these contributors is

96

necessary in human studies (15).

Animal models can mechanistically explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-

98

CoV-2 independent of confounding gender-associated factors that impact exposure, testing, and

99

use of healthcare globally. Transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 (K18-hACE2) are

100

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and in this model, males experience greater morbidity than females,

101

despite having similar viral loads in respiratory tissues (e.g., nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs)

102

(16, 17). Transcriptional analyses of lung tissue revealed that inflammatory cytokine and

103

chemokine gene expression is greater in males than females early during infection, and these

104

transcriptional patterns show a stronger correlation with disease outcomes among males than

105

females (16, 17). In addition to utilizing hACE2 mice, mouse-adapted strains of SARS-CoV-2

106

have been developed and can productively infect wild-type mice but have not yet been used to

107

evaluate sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of disease (18-20).

108

Golden Syrian hamsters are also being used as an animal model of SARS-CoV-2

109

pathogenesis because they are susceptible to human clinical strains of viruses, without the need

110

for genetic modifications in either the host or virus. While studies have included males and

111

females in analyses of age-associated differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (21), few

112

studies have specifically evaluated males vs. females to better understand sex differences in

113

disease. There are studies of golden Syrian hamsters that have included male and female

114

hamsters but did not have sufficient numbers of animals to accurately compare the sexes (22).

115

Sex differences are not reported in either viral RNA, infectious virus, or cytokine mRNA

116

expression at a single time point (i.e., 4 days post-infection) in the lungs of golden Syrian

117

hamsters (23). There is a gap in the literature of studies designed to rigorously test the hypothesis

118

that biological sex alters disease severity and immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

121

Males experience greater morbidity than females following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which

122

cannot be reversed by estradiol (E2) treatment.

123

6

Intranasal inoculation of human clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 causes productive

124

infection in golden Syrian hamsters (24-26). To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection

125

results in sex differences in disease outcomes, adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters

126

were infected with 105 TCID50 of virus and changes in body mass were monitored for 28 days

127

post-inoculation (dpi). Mortality was not observed in either sex, but infected hamsters

128

progressively lost body mass during the first week before starting to recover (Figure 1A). The

129

peak body mass loss in female hamsters was observed at 6 dpi (-12.3±1.8%), whereas peak mass

130

loss in male hamsters was observed at 7 dpi (-17.3±1.9%). The percentage of body mass loss was

131

significantly greater in male than female hamsters at 8 to 10 dpi and throughout the recovery

132

period (p<0.05; Figure 1A). Recovery to baseline body mass after SARS-CoV-2 infection

133

occurred within 2 weeks for female and at 3 weeks for male hamsters (Figure 1A).

134

To evaluate pulmonary disease in SARS-CoV-2-infected males and females, chest

135

computed tomography (CT) was performed at the peak of lung disease (7 dpi). As previously

136

reported by others (26), multiple and bilateral mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and

137

consolidations were detected in both females and males (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure

138

1). In order to reduce bias in the visual assessment, we developed an unbiased approach to

139

quantify lung disease by chest CT. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn to capture total and

140

diseased (pneumonic) lung volumes (Figure 1C). As reported in COVID-19 patients who

141

underwent CT (27, 28), there was significantly more disease in the lung of male versus female

142

hamsters (p<0.05) (Figure 1D). These results indicate that infected male hamsters developed

143

more severe disease, including more extensive lung injury, than females.

144

7

Previous studies show that estrogens, including but not limited to estradiol (E2), are anti-

145

inflammatory and can reduce pulmonary tissue damage following respiratory infections,

146

including with influenza A viruses or Streptococcus pneumoniae (29-31). To test the hypothesis

147

that E2 could dampen inflammation and pulmonary tissue damage to improve outcomes in male

148

hamsters, males received either exogenous E2 capsules or placebo capsules prior to SARS-CoV-

149

2 infection. Plasma concentrations of E2 were significantly elevated in E2-treated males

150

compared with placebo-treated males (p<0.05; Figure 2A) and were well within the normal

151

range of plasma concentrations of E2 in cyclic female hamsters (30-700pg/mL) (32). Animals

152

were followed for 7 dpi and changes in body mass and chest CT score were quantified. There

153

was no effect of E2-treatment on morbidity as placebo- and E2-treated males had equivalent

154

percentages of body mass loss (Figure 2B). CT findings noted in E2-treated males were similar

155

to those noted in placebo-treated males (Supplementary Figure 1) and chest CT scans revealed

156

in CT score between groups (Figure 2C). Moreover, histopathology demonstrated similar cell

157

infiltration and pneumonic areas between groups (Figure 2D). From these data, we conclude that

158

the treatment of gonadally-intact males with E2 did not improve morbidity or pulmonary

159

outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

160
161

SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics are similar between the sexes

162

To test the hypothesis that male-biased disease outcomes were caused by increased virus

163

load or faster replication kinetics, subsets of infected male and female hamsters were euthanized

164

at 2, 4, or 7 dpi and infectious virus titers were measured in the respiratory tissue homogenates.

165

The peak infectious virus titers in the nasal turbinates (Figure 3A), trachea (Figure 3B), and

166

lungs (Figure 3C) were detected at 2 dpi, decreased at 4 dpi, and was cleared at 7 dpi. There

167

were no sex differences in either peak virus titers or clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from any of the

168

respiratory tissues tested (Figure 3A-C). Although the infectious virus was cleared from the

169

respiratory tract of most of the hamsters by 7 dpi (Figure 3A-C), viral RNA was still detectable

170

in the lungs at 14 dpi in all of the SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, with no differences between

171

the sexes (Figure 3D). These data illustrate that sex differences in the disease phenotype are not

172

due to differences in infectious virus loads or persistence of viral RNA.

173
174
175

Cytokine concentrations in the lungs are comparable between the sexes
To test whether local or systemic cytokine activity differed between the sexes,

176

concentrations of cytokines were measured in lung and spleen homogenates at 2, 4, or 7 dpi. Sex

177

differences were not observed 2-7 dpi in the concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, , IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-

178

β, IFN- γ, or IL-10 in either lung (Figure 4A-F) or spleen (Supplementary Table 1)

179

homogenates. In both male and female hamsters, lung concentrations of IL-1β (Supplementary

180

Figure 2A), TNF-α (Supplementary Figure 2B), IFN-α (Supplementary Figure 2D), and IFN-

181

β (Supplementary Figure 2E), but not IL-6 (Supplementary Figure 2C), IFN-γ

182

(Supplementary Figure 2F), or IL-10 (Supplementary Table 1), were greater in samples from

183

infected as compared with sex-matched mock-infected hamsters (p<0.05 in each case). In

184

contrast, there was no effect of infection on the concentration of cytokines in the spleen

185

(Supplementary Table 1). To determine if cytokine concentrations correlated with virus titers

186

from the same lung homogenates, Spearman correlational analyses were performed and revealed

187

that concentrations of TNF were positively associated with virus titers at 2 dpi ((p<0.05;

188

Supplementary Figure 3B) and concentrations of IFN were negatively associated with virus

189

titers at 4 dpi (p<0.05; Supplementary Figure 4E). The concentrations of other cytokines

190

measured at either 2 or 4 dpi were not associated with virus titers in the lungs (Supplementary

191

Figures 3-4) Taken together, these data provide no evidence that male-biased disease outcomes

192

are caused by differential production of cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2 during acute

193

infection.

194
195

Female hamsters develop greater antibody responses than males during SARS-CoV-2

196

infection

197

To evaluate whether females developed greater antiviral antibody responses than males,

198

as is observed in response to influenza A viruses (33), we measured virus-specific

199

immunoglobulins as well as neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers in plasma and respiratory samples

200

collected throughout the course of infection. To begin our evaluation, we inactivated SARS-

201

CoV-2 virions to analyze plasma IgG that recognize diverse virus antigens. Anti-SARS-CoV-2

202

IgG titers were detected within a week post-infection, with females developing greater antibody

203

titers than males at 21 and 28 dpi (p<0.05; Figure 5A). Using live SARS-CoV-2, we measured

204

nAb titers in plasma, which were detectable 7-28 dpi, with females having or trending towards

205

significantly greater titers than males at 14-28 dpi (p<0.05; Figure 5B).

206

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust antibody responses against the spike or receptor-

207

binding domain of the spike protein (S-RBD) in humans and in animal models (14, 34, 35). S-

208

RBD-specific IgM (Figure 5C), IgA (Figure 5D), and IgG (Figure 5E) antibodies were

209

detected in plasma within a week post-infection. In plasma, anti-S-RBD IgM antibody titers were

210

significantly greater in females than males at 21 dpi (p<0.05; Figure 5C), and anti-S-RBD IgA

211

and IgG antibody titers were significantly greater in females than males at 21 and 28 dpi

212

(p<0.05; Figure 5D-E). Variants of SARS-CoV-2 due to mutations in the RBD of spike protein,

213

including the N501Y variant, were first reported in the United Kingdom and subsequently

214

circulated worldwide (36). The mink variant (Y453F), European variant (N439K), and South

215

African/Brazilian variants (E484K) have raised concerns over increased transmissibility and

216

escape from host immune responses (37, 38). Considering the emergence of novel variants, we

217

tested the hypothesis that females would have greater cross-reactive antibody responses to

218

SARS-CoV-2 variants. Similar to wild type S-RDB (Figure 5E), IgG antibody titers against the

219

S-RBD mutants N501Y, Y453F, N439K, and E484K were significantly greater in female than

220

male hamsters (p<0.05 in each case; Figure 5F). Overall, IgG responses to the E484K, but not

221

the N501Y variant, were significantly lower in both sexes as compared with responses to the

222

wild-type S-RBD (p<0.05 for main effect of variant; Figure 5F).

223

Local antibody responses at the site of infection are critical for SARS-CoV-2 control and

224

recovery (39, 40). Anti-S-RBD-IgM titers were greatest in the lungs at 7 dpi, being significantly

225

greater in female than male hamsters (p<0.05; Figure 6A). A cornerstone of mucosal humoral

226

immunity is IgA and anti-S-RBD IgA titers peaked at 7 dpi, with a trend for higher titers in

227

females than males (p=0.07; Figure 6B). By 28 dpi, females still had detectable anti-S-RBD IgA

228

titers in their lungs, whereas males did not (p<0.05; Figure 6B). Anti-S-RBD IgG titers in the

229

lungs were elevated 7-28 dpi with a higher trend observed at 28dpi in females than males

230

(p=0.09; Figure 6C). In the trachea, but not in nasal turbinate or lung homogenates, females had

231

significantly greater anti-S-RBD IgG titers than males (p<0.05; Figure 6D). In summary, these

232

data demonstrate that female hamsters develop greater systemic and local antiviral antibody

233

responses compared with male hamsters during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion

236

Sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes are well documented (9, 13). There is a critical

237

need to develop accurate animal models that reflect the male-bias in disease outcomes to better

238

understand the underlying mechanisms. We show that male hamsters suffer more systemic (body

239

mass loss) and local (pulmonary pathology) symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection than females.

240

We tested several potential mechanisms that could mediate male-biased outcomes from

241

infection, including: 1) lack of estrogenic protection, 2) greater virus replication, 3) exacerbated

242

cytokine responses, and 4) reduced humoral immunity. Our data reveal that females produce

243

greater antibody responses, both locally in the respiratory tract as well as systemically in plasma,

244

but if this causes female hamsters to suffer less severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection

245

remains to be determined.

246

Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters are typically mild, with

247

reduced body mass after infection consistently observed (21, 24-26). Previous studies have

248

shown that hamsters lose body mass after infection, reaching peak loss at 5 to 7 dpi, followed by

249

recovery (24-26). Body mass loss in hamsters, regardless of age, has been associated with the

250

dose of virus inoculum, with higher dose resulting in greater body mass loss (26, 41). Body mass

251

loss also is influenced by age; older hamsters (i.e., 7 to 9 months old) had greater mass loss than

252

younger animals (i.e., 4-6 weeks old) (21, 26). Sex is another factor impacting body mass loss, as

253

a reliable clinical sign of disease in hamsters following SARS-CoV-2 infection. As reported in

254

humans, older age and male sex are clinical variables associated with greater clinical

255

manifestations of disease in hamsters.

256

A novel determinant of clinical disease that was utilized in the current study was

257

unbiased, quantitative chest CT-imaging analysis. Previous reports describe chest CT findings in

258

female SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters only and show lung abnormalities, including

259

multilobular ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation (26), as observed in patients with

260

COVID-19 (42). In the current study, CT-imaging revealed that multilobular GGO and

261

consolidations were observed to a greater extent in male than female SARS-CoV-2-infected

262

hamsters at 7 dpi. Whether the sexes differ in the recovery of pulmonary damage following

263

infection requires greater consideration. There are a number of registered clinical trials of

264

therapeutic E2 administration (NCT04359329 and NCT04539626) in COVID-19, which raised

the question as to whether disease outcomes in male hamsters could be improved through

266

administration of E2. In this study, pre-treatment of male hamsters with E2 prior to SARS-CoV-

267

2 infection did not reduce either weight loss, observed histological damage to lung tissue or the

268

observed multilobular GGO and consolidations.

269

SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs of infected golden

270

Syrian hamsters (24, 25). Virus replication peaks in respiratory tissue within 2-4 dpi, with virus

271

clearance typically occurring within one week (21, 24, 25). Viral RNA, however, is present in

272

the lungs of infected hamsters beyond 7 dpi (21, 22, 25). We observed peak infectious virus load

273

in nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs at 2 dpi, with clearance by 7 dpi. After infectious virus had

274

been cleared, viral RNA still remained detectable in the lungs up to 14 dpi. Previous studies have

275

reported that while aged hamsters experience worse disease outcomes than young hamsters, virus

276

titers in respiratory tissues are similar (21, 26). We further show that although young adult male

277

hamsters experience worse disease outcomes than female hamsters, sex differences in virus titers

278

in respiratory tissues are not observed.

During SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters, cytokine gene expression, including Tnfα,

280

Ifnα, and Ifnγ in the nasal turbinates and lungs, is triggered at 2 dpi, peaks at 4 dpi, and returns to

281

baseline by 7 dpi, but comparisons between males and females have not performed (24, 41, 43).

282

Analyses of protein concentrations of cytokines in lung and spleen homogenates revealed no

283

differences between males and females during the first week of infection. Although sex

284

differences were not observed, concentrations of TNF and IFN were positively and

285

negatively, respectively, associated with virus replication in lungs, regardless of sex. Our

286

findings suggest that cytokine production, either locally in the lungs or systemically in the spleen

287

does not underlie sex differences in clinical manifestations of disease in hamsters and adds to the

288

growing list of questions about the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in

289

human populations. The possibility of differences in cellular infiltration into pulmonary tissue

290

requires greater consideration, which will be feasible only when better reagents, including

291

antibodies, become available for hamsters.

292

Studies have reported that both IgG and virus neutralizing antibodies are detected in

293

serum from SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters as early as 7 dpi and persist through

294

43 dpi (24, 35, 44). In the present study, females developed greater IgG responses against both

295

SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variant S-RBD as well as antiviral nAb titers in both plasma and

296

respiratory tissue homogenates than males. We also showed that mucosal IgA titers are greater

297

in the lungs of female than male hamsters and are detectable as early as 7 dpi. Passive transfer of

298

convalescent sera from infected to naïve hamsters as well as reinfection of previously infected

299

hamsters carrying high antibody titers, have both been shown to provide protection by reducing

300

virus titers in the respiratory tissues (24, 26). Likewise, hamster models of SARS-CoV-2

301

immunization have shown an inverse correlation between antibody responses and either virus

302

titers in the respiratory tissues or body mass loss (45). These studies highlight the possible

303

protective role of antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may contribute to faster

304

recovery in female than male hamsters.

305

Golden Syrian hamsters have already been successfully used in SARS-CoV-2

306

transmission studies (24, 25, 46), to compare routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection (41, 47), to

307

evaluate convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy (24, 26, 48-50), and to test

308

therapeutics and vaccines (23, 45). This model provides a unique opportunity to understand the

309

kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology not only systemically but also at the site of infection,

310

the respiratory system. Sex as a biological variable should be considered in all studies utilizing

311

golden Syrian hamsters for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods

314

Viruses, cells, and viral proteins: Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 cells were cultured in complete cell

315

growth medium (CM) comprising Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented

316

with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1mM glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, and penicillin (100

317

U/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) antibiotics (51). The SARS-CoV-2 strain (SARS-C0V-

318

2/USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources

319

Repository (NR#52281, BEI Resources, VA, USA). SARS-CoV-2 stocks were generated by

320

infecting VeroTMPRSS2 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 TCID50s per cell and

321

the infected cell culture supernatant was collected at 72 hours post infection clarified by

322

centrifugation at 400 g for 10 minutes and then stored at -70C (51). SARS-CoV-2 recombinant

323

spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) protein used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

324

(ELISA) was expressed and purified using methods described previously (14) or purchased from

325

SinoBiologicals. To obtain whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2, VeroTMPRSS2 cells were infected

326

at a MOI of 0.01 and the infected cell culture supernatant was collected at 72 hours post

327

infection. Virus was inactivated by the addition of 0.05% beta-propiolactone (51) followed by

328

incubation at 4C for 18 hours. The beta-propiolactone was inactivated by incubation at 37C for 2

329

hours and the inactivated virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 25000g for 1h at 40C and

330

protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

331
332

Animal experiments: Male and female golden Syrian hamsters (7-8 weeks of age) were

333

purchased from Envigo (Haslett, MI). Animals were housed under standard housing conditions

334

(68-76°F, 30-70% relative humidity, 12-12 light-dark cycle) in PNC cages (Allentown, NJ) with

335

paper bedding (Teklad 7099 TEK-Fresh, Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) in an animal biological safety

336

level 3 (ABSL-3) facility at the Johns Hopkins University-Koch Cancer Research Building.

337

Animals were given nesting material (Enviropak, Lab Supply, Fort Worth, TX) and ad libitum

338

RO water and feed (2018 SX Teklad, Envigo, Madison, WI). After 1-2 weeks of acclimation,

339

animals (8-10 weeks of age) were inoculated with 105 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious

340

dose) of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020) in 100μL DMEM (50μl/naris) through intranasal route

341

under ketamine (60-80mg/kg) and xylazine (4-5mg/kg) anesthesia administered

342

intraperitoneally. Control animals received equivalent volume of DMEM. Animals were

343

randomly assigned to be euthanized at 2, 4, 7, 14, or 28-days post infection (dpi). Body mass was

344

measured at the day of inoculation (baseline) and endpoint, with daily measurements up to 10 dpi

345

and on 14, 21, and 28 dpi, when applicable per group. Blood samples were collected pre-

346

inoculation (baseline) and at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 dpi, when applicable per group. Survival

347

blood collection was performed on the sublingual vein, whereas terminal bleeding was done by

348

cardiac puncture under isoflurane (500μl drop jar; Fluriso™, VetOne®, Boise, ID) anesthesia.

349

Blood was collected into EDTA (survival and terminal) and/or sodium citrate tubes (terminal).

350

Plasma was separated by blood centrifugation at 3500rpm, 15min at 40C. After cardiac puncture,

351

animals were humanely euthanized using a euthanasia solution (Euthasol®, Virbac, Fort Worth,

352

TX). Nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung samples for antibody/cytokine assays and virus titration

353

were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -800C.

354
355

Determination of infectious virus titers and viral genome copies in tissue homogenates: To

356

obtain tissue homogenates, DMEM with 100unit/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin was

357

added (10% w/v) to tubes containing hamster nasal turbinate, lungs, and tracheal tissue samples.

358

Lysing Matrix D beads were added to each tube and the samples were homogenized in a

359

FastPrep-24 bench top bead beating system (MPBio) for 40sec at 6.0m/s, followed by

360

centrifugation for 5min at 10,000g at room temperature. Samples were returned to ice and the

361

supernatant was distributed equally into 2 tubes. To inactivate SARS-CoV-2, TritonX100 was

362

added to one of the tubes to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated at room temperature for

363

30 minutes. The homogenates were stored at -700C.

364

Infectious virus titers in respiratory tissue homogenates were determined by TCID50

365

assay (14, 51). Briefly, tissue homogenates were 10-fold serially diluted in infection media (CM

366

with 2.5% instead of 10% FBS), transferred in sextuplicate into the 96-well plates confluent with

367

Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 cells, incubated at 370C for 4 days, and stained with naphthol blue-black

368

solution for visualization. The infectious virus titers in TCID50/mL were determined by Reed and

369

Muench method. For detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies, RNA was extracted from lungs

370

using the Qiagen viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) was

371

performed as described (52).

373

Computed tomography (CT) and image analysis: Live animals were imaged inside in-house

374

developed; sealed biocontainment devices compliant with BSL-3, as previously reported (53).

375

Seven days post-infection, SARS-CoV-2-infected males (n=13), females (n=14) and E2 treated

376

(n=13) hamsters underwent chest CT using the nanoScan PET/CT (Mediso USA, MA, USA)

377

small animal imager. CT images were visualized and analyzed using VivoQuant 2020 lung

378

segmentation tool (Invicro, MA, USA) (54). Briefly, an entire lung volume (LV) was created,

379

and volumes of interests (VOIs) were shaped around the pulmonary lesions using global

380

thresholding for Hounsfield Units (HU) ≥ 0 and disease severity (CT score) was quantified as the

381

percentage of diseased lung in each animal. The investigators were blinded to the group

382

assignments.

383
384

Hormone replacement and quantification: Estradiol (E2) capsules were prepared of Silastic

385

Brand medical grade tubing (0.062 in. i.d. x 0.125 in. o.d.), 10 mm in length, sealed with Factor

386

II 6382 RTV Silicone and Elastomer, and filled 5 mm with 17β-estradiol (55). Capsules were

387

incubated overnight in sterile saline at 37°C prior to implantation. The E2 dosage was chosen

388

because this size capsule has previously been shown to produce blood levels within the

389

physiological range of E2 measured in intact female hamsters during early proestrus (when E2

390

levels are at their peak) (56, 57). Circulating concentrations of E2 were measured by a rodent

391

estradiol ELISA kit as per manufacturer’s instructions (Calbiotech, CA) .

392
393

Antibody ELISAs: Hamster antibody ELISA protocol was modified from human COVID-19

394

antibody ELISA protocol described previously (14). ELISA plates (96-well plates, Immunol

4HBX, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with either spike receptor binding domain (S-

396

RBD) or whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 proteins (2 μg/mL, 50μl/well) in 1X PBS and

397

incubated at 40C overnight. Coated plates were washed thrice with wash buffer (1X PBS + 0.1%

398

Tween-20), blocked with 3% nonfat milk solution in wash buffer and incubated at room

399

temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, blocking buffer was discarded and two-fold serially

400

diluted plasma (starting at 1:100 dilution) or tissue homogenates (starting at 1:10 dilution) were

401

added and plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After washing plates 3 times,

402

HRP-conjugated secondary IgG (1:10000, Abcam, MA, USA), IgA (1:250, Brookwood

403

Biomedical, AL, USA) or IgM (1:250, Brookwood Biomedical, AL, USA) antibodies were

404

added. After addition of secondary IgG antibody plates were incubated in room temperature for 1

405

hour while for IgA and IgM antibodies, plates were incubated at 40C overnight. Sample and

406

antibody dilution were done in 1% nonfat milk solution in wash buffer. Following washing,

407

reactions were developed by adding 100μl/well of SIGMAFAST OPD (o-phenylenediamine

408

dihydrochloride) (MilliporeSigma) solution for 10 min, stopped using 3M hydrochloric acid

409

(HCL) solution and plates were read at 490nm wavelength using ELISA plate reader (BioTek

410

Instruments). The endpoint antibody titer was determined by using a cut-off value which is three-

411

times the absorbance of first dilution of mock (uninfected) animal samples.

412
413

Microneutralization assay: Heat inactivated (560C, 35min) plasma samples were two-fold

414

serially diluted in infection media (starting at 1:20 dilution) and incubated with 100 TCID50 of

415

SARS-CoV-2. After 1-hour incubation at room temperature, plasma-virus mix was transferred

416

into 96-well plate confluent with Vero-E6-TMPRSS2 cells in sextuplet. After 6 hours, inocula

417

were removed, fresh infection media was added, and plates were incubated at 370C for 2 days.

421

Cytokine ELISAs: Cytokine concentrations in TritonX100 inactivated lung and spleen

422

homogenates were determined by individual ELISA kits for hamster IFN-α (mybiosource.com;

423

MBS010919) IFN-β (mybiosource.com; MBS014227), TNF-α (mybiosource.com;

424

MBS046042), IL-1β (mybiosource.com; MBS283040), IFNγ (ARP; EHA0005), IL-10 (ARP;

425

EHA0008), and IL-6 (ARP; EHA0006) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were

426

pre-diluted 1:5 to 1:10 as necessary in the appropriate kit sample dilution buffer. Total protein in

427

the homogenates were measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

428
429

Statistical Analyses: Statistical analyses were done in GraphPad Prism 9. Changes in body mass

430

were compared using two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple

431

comparison test. Chest CT scores were compared by unpaired Mann-Whitney test. E2

432

concentration were compared by two-tailed unpaired t-test. Virus titers and antibody responses

433

were log transformed and compared using two-way ANOVA or mixed-effects analysis followed

434

by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Cytokine concentrations were normalized to total

435

protein content in lung homogenates and compared using two-Way ANOVA. Associations

436

between cytokines and virus titers in lungs were conducted using Spearman correlational

437

analyses. Differences were considered to be significant at p<0.05.

Figure 3: Virus titers were comparable in the respiratory system of SARS-CoV-2 infected

735

male and female hamsters. Adult (8-10 weeks) male and female golden Syrian hamsters were

736

infected with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2. Infectious virus titers in the homogenates of nasal

737

turbinates (A), trachea (B), and lungs (C), were determined by TCID50 assay on 2, 4, and 7 dpi.

738

Likewise, virus RNA copies in 100ng of total RNA were tested in the lungs of infected hamsters

739

at 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 dpi (D). Data represent mean ± standard error of the mean from one or two

740

experiment(s) (n = 3-5/group) and were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (mixed-effects analysis)

741

followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test.

746

and IL-1β (A), TNF-α (B), IL-6 (C), IFN-α (D), IFN-β (E), and IFN-γ (F) cytokine

747

concentrations (pg/mg total protein) were determined in the lungs by ELISA. Mock-infected

748

animal samples from different dpi were presented together as 0 dpi. Data represent

749

mean ± standard error of the mean from one or two independent experiments (n = 2-6/group/sex)

evaluated in plasma at 28 dpi (F). Considering similar antibody responses at 6 and 7 dpi, values

759

were presented together as 7 dpi. Data represent mean ± standard error of the mean from two
