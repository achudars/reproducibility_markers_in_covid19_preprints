Summary

How viruses from the Coronaviridae family initiate viral RNA synthesis is unknown. Here we show that the
SARS-CoV-1 and -2 Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain on nsp12
uridylates the viral cofactor nsp8, forming a UMP-Nsp8 covalent intermediate that subsequently primes
RNA synthesis from a poly(A) template; a protein-priming mechanism reminiscent of Picornaviridae
enzymes. In parallel, the RdRp active site of nsp12 synthesizes a pppGpU primer, which primes (-)ssRNA
synthesis at the precise genome-poly(A) junction. The guanosine analogue 5'-triphosphate AT-9010
(prodrug: AT-527) tightly binds to the NiRAN and inhibits both nsp8-labeling and the initiation of RNA
synthesis. A 2.98 Å resolution Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8)2 /RNA/NTP
quaternary complex shows AT-9010 simultaneously binds to both NiRAN and RdRp active site of nsp12,
blocking their respective activities. AT-527 is currently in phase II clinical trials, and is a potent inhibitor of
SARS-CoV-1 and -2, representing a promising drug for COVID-19 treatment.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a human pathogen of the
Coronaviridae (CoV) family, order Nidovirales, responsible for the ongoing pandemic which has so far
resulted in >2.5 million fatalities (https://covid19.who.int/). This has prompted large-scale, global efforts
which have greatly advanced our overall understanding of the virus and expedited vaccine development.
However, much remains to be known regarding the specific mechanisms directing CoV replication and
transcription of viral RNA, of direct importance for appropriate antiviral strategies.
Having ~30,000 nucleotides, the CoV positive-sense RNA (+RNA) genome is approximately three-times
larger than that of significant human pathogenic +RNA viruses such as dengue, zika and poliovirus. This size
difference reflects the acquisition of novel domains, many of which remain poorly characterized despite
being potential candidates for CoV-specific drug targets. The viral genome is principally comprised of twolarge open reading frames, Orf1a and Orf1ab, which are translated to yield 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 –
nsp16) responsible for viral replication and genome maintenance (Hartenian et al., 2020). Among these is the
viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), which associates with two small cofactor proteins,
nsp7 and nsp8, to form the minimal replication-transcription complex (RTC) capable of RNA synthesis
(Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019; Subissi et al., 2014). The 3’ end of the CoV genome specifies a nested set of
subgenomic mRNAs which are translated to yield structural and accessory proteins.
Once expressed in the target cell, the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and associated proteins
must diligently initiate viral RNA synthesis at precise termini to ensure all the genetic information is copied.
RNA viruses have evolved a diverse range of initiation strategies, often dictated by subtle structural
variations in the RdRp. Initiation is commonly divided into two main categories: de novo (primerindependent), and primer-dependent. However, specific mechanisms within these broadly defined groups can
vary considerably. In the case of CoVs, the mechanism for initiation of RNA synthesis is poorly understood
and somewhat controversial. The viral protein nsp8 is under scrutiny in this process, since it has been
reported to synthesize short priming oligonucleotides (Imbert et al., 2006), carries an adenosine-specific
terminal transferase (Tvarogová et al., 2019), and exhibits primer-extension activities (te Velthuis et al.,
2012). On a structural level, the CoV RdRp nsp12 is related to "small-thumb" RNA polymerases, such as
those of Picornaviridae (Peersen, 2019). These polymerases prime RNA synthesis through a ‘proteinprimed’ mechanism (Paul et al., 1998), whereby a tyrosine hydroxyl group of a small viral peptide, known as
VPg (Viral Protein genome-linked) is first covalently labeled with a uridine monophosphate (referred to as
UMPylation). The VPg-pU is then extended to a dinucleotide and used to prime RNA synthesis, yielding
genomic RNA which remains covalently linked to the viral VPg. Notably, the N-terminus of CoV nsp12
(just upstream of the RdRp domain) contains a Nidovirus-specific domain known as the NiRAN, which has
been shown to mediate the covalent transfer of nucleoside monophosphates (NMP) to CoV nsp9 (Slanina et
al., 2021). This activity was speculated to play a role in protein-priming, among other things (Lehmann et al.,
2015), however so far there has been no evidence to support this, and the role of cofactor NMPylation in the
viral life cycle remains unknown. More recently (and independent of its NMP-protein transferase activity),
the NiRAN was proposed to participate in the guanylyltransferase step of viral RNA capping (Yan et al.,
2021), suggesting it may play more than one role.
As with other RNA viruses, the universal set of core replicative enzymes, including the RdRp, remain at the
forefront of drug-design strategies, with many clinically approved viral inhibitors currently being repurposed
for attempted treatment of COVID infections. These include nucleoside analogues (NA). NAs play an
important role in antiviral therapies because of their favorable drug properties: they can be administered as
prodrugs which may be orally available and able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the host cell, NA
prodrugs are metabolised by cellular kinases into active 5’-triphosphate forms which compete with native
nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) for incorporation into the viral RNA by the RdRp. Upon incorporation, NAs
cause either chain-termination of RNA synthesis, or act as mutagenic nucleotides lethally altering the genetic

make-up of the virus (Pruijssers and Denison, 2019). However, CoVs stand out amongst RNA viruses for
possessing an RNA-repair 3'-to-5' exonuclease (ExoN, nsp14) able to excise mismatched bases as well as
chain terminating NAs (Bouvet et al., 2012; Eckerle et al., 2007, 2010; Ferron et al., 2018; Minskaia et al.,
2006), generally compromising the efficacy of these drugs. While NAs are generally considered as RdRpspecific inhibitors, their potential to target other NTP-utilizing viral proteins, such as the NiRAN domain,
has been largely unexplored.
Here, we investigate the role of the NiRAN domain of SARS-CoV in the initiation of viral RNA synthesis,
and the potential for this domain to be targeted by NAs. We show that the CoV nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8) 2 minimal
RTC can initiate RNA synthesis through two distinct pathways: one protein-primed and mediated by the
NiRAN domain through the UMPylation of nsp8, and the other through de novo synthesis of dinucleotide
primers in a NiRAN-independent fashion. We additionally report the inhibition of both NiRAN transferase
activity and de novo synthesis initiation with a promising guanosine NA candidate, AT-9010, the active
triphosphate of the prodrug AT-527 (Good et al., 2021). Resolution of the nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8) 2 Cryo-EM
structure at 2.98 Å shows three target sites in the RTC: AT-9010 i) bound in the NiRAN active site; ii)
incorporated at the +1 position of an RNA primer in the RdRp, and iii) poised for incorporation in the NTP
binding site, confirming it is able to target several nucleotide binding sites of CoV-nsp12.

Results

The Nsp12 NiRAN domain UMPylates Nsp8
To elucidate the specifics behind SARS-CoV nsp12 nucleotidyl transferase activity, we incubated various
combinations of SARS-CoV nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8, constituting the minimal RTC required for RNA
synthesis (Subissi et al., 2014), in the presence of α32P-UTP. UMP is efficiently and specifically transferred
to nsp8 in a reaction dependent on nsp12 and MnCl 2 (Figure 1A, Figure S1A-C). Furthermore, a linked
version of nsp7 and 8 (nsp7L8) is unable to be labeled by the NiRAN, indicated the authentic N-terminus of
nsp8 is likely required. In contrast to the related equine arteritis virus (Lehmann et al., 2015), no covalent
intermediate with nsp12 is formed. Various NiRAN mutants, including K73A, abolish labeling of nsp8
confirming that nucleotide transfer activity is provided by the NiRAN domain and not by nsp8 itself (Figure
1A,B, Figure S1D,E). The same specificity for nsp8-labeling was observed for the SARS-CoV-2 RTC
(Figure S2F). A comparison of nsp8 labeling efficiency with the four native nucleotides shows UTP is the
preferred substrate, albeit with a structural flexibility which allows the binding and transfer of GTP, CTP and
ATP to a lesser extent (Figure 1C). To determine the labeling site, stability of the UMP-nsp8 bond was
assessed at high or low pH (Figure 1D). The UMP-nsp8 bond is stable in 0.1M HCL, but alkali labile,
indicating that most of the UMP is bound to the hydroxyl group of either a serine or threonine residue.
Interestingly however, when the nsp8 labeling reaction is performed in the presence of a poly(A) 27
oligoribonucleotide and nsp7 (i.e. the nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8) 2 RTC), the UMP-nsp8 bond is stable at both high
and low pH, indicative of a phosphodiester bond with a tyrosine hydroxyl group (Figure 1D). Only two
serines (S11 and S85) and one tyrosine (Y71) are highly conserved among CoV nsp8 (Subissi et al., 2014).
Single and double alanine-mutants of these residues do not eliminate labeling; Notably, we detect an increase
in labeling efficiency for S11A suggesting that this residue may participate in the selectivity of the labeling
site (Figure 1B). This data suggests that several residues of nsp8 can be labeled by the NiRAN, and that this
is depended on the conformation of the RTC, dictated by the presence or absence of RNA. Recent Cryo-EM
structure models show nsp8 forming ‘molecular sliding poles’ stabilizing the RNA exiting from the
polymerase active site (Hillen et al., 2020). In the absence of RNA, these flexible N-terminal extensions of
nsp8 would be in an alternative conformation, altering the nucleotidylation site, and potentially serving as a
mechanism to regulate NiRAN activity.

SARS-CoV UMPylated nsp8 is involved in a unique protein-primed RNA synthesis step
We recently established a high-throughput, fluorescent screening assay using the purified SARS-CoV RTC,
able to synthesise poly(U) from a poly(A) template in the absence of a primer (Eydoux et al., 2021). To
gauge how synthesis is initiated in these assays, and whether the UMPylation of nsp8 is involved, we
incubated the nsp12-nsp7-(nsp8)2 RTC with poly(A)27 oligo-ribonucleotide and UTP (supplemented with
α32P-UTP), and separated the products on denaturing SDS-PAGE and high-resolution urea PAGE sequencing
gels (Figure 2A,B and Figure S2A). The RTC efficiently synthesizes labeled RNA in the presence of MnCl 2
(Figure S1B,C), with the majority of products longer than the expected Poly(U) 27 size (Figure 2B, Figure
S2A). Modification of either the 5’ or 3’ end of the poly(A) 27 template does not affect synthesis,
demonstrating that these products are not a result of nsp8 terminal-transferase activity (Tvarogová et al.,
2019), or other template modification (Figure S2B). Rather, once a full-length poly(U) 27 product is
synthesized, the complex is able to switch to a new poly(A) 27 acceptor template and continue synthesis,
resulting in products that are multimeric in length to the input poly(A) 27 template. Similar template-switching
activity has been previously described for other viral RdRps (Menéndez-Arias et al., 2017; Woodman et al.,
2016). Despite the previously reported primase and polymerase-related activities of nsp8 (Imbert et al., 2006;
Tvarogová et al., 2019; te Velthuis et al., 2012), we do not observe activity of nsp8 alone or in combination

with nsp7 in this context (Figure 2A, Figure S2A). We additionally noted the presence of radiolabeled
product either in the wells, or with very limited migration down the gel (Figure 2B, red arrow). Proteinase K
(PK) hydrolysis of the polymerase complexes lead to the digestion of these products and results in the further
release of poly(U) synthesized RNA, consistent with an nsp8-primed synthesis event. Western blot analysis
with anti-nsp8 confirms that the higher products (>40 kDa on SDS PAGE) are covalently linked with nsp8,
and not another protein (Figure S2C, lanes 1-2). Furthermore, the specificity of the labeling was
demonstrated by mutating the K73A of the NiRAN, showing this reaction is NiRAN-dependent (Figure S2C,
lane 11). Interestingly, polymerization can also be initiated on poly(U) and poly(C) templates through the
addition of ATP and GTP, respectively (Figure S2D,E). However, in contrast to poly(U) synthesis, poly(A)
and poly(G) products are not retained in the wells, and furthermore are not sensitive to proteinase K
digestion. Thus, protein-primed RNA synthesis is UTP-specific, consistent with the preference for UMPnsp8 labeling by the NiRAN domain. We conclude that the RTC complex UMPylates one of its presumably
bound nsp8, which serves as an uridylated primer to initiate poly(U) n synthesis.

Two independent pathways of primer synthesis co-exist to initiate RNA synthesis
For the Picornaviridae family, the VPg protein is used to prime both plus and minus strand synthesis. Its
covalent attachment to the 5’ end of the RNA additionally substitutes for the RNA-cap, protecting the viral
RNA from host cell degradation. In contrast, the CoV genome presumably contains a conventional
m7
GpppA2’Om RNA cap-1 structure (Bouvet et al., 2010). This difference suggests that for CoVs, the nsp8UMP protein-primed strategy is specific to minus strand synthesis, templated from the poly(A) tail. We
noted that NiRAN mutants that completely eliminate nsp8 UMPylation are still able to synthesise poly(U)
RNA, although notably with a loss in high-molecular weight products (Figure S3A). To address this, we setup an order-of-addition experiment, incubating the RTC either with UTP or poly(A) 27 RNA first, prior to
addition of the complementary reagent. Pre-incubation with UTP, promoting NiRAN-mediated nsp8UMPylation, yields exclusively high-molecular weight poly(U) n products covalently bound to nsp8 (Figure
2C, red arrow, Figure S3B). In contrast, pre-incubation of the RTC with poly(A) 27 results in production of
both protein-bound RNA (released by PK digestion), and long poly(U) n products not bound to nsp8 (Figure
2C). NiRAN mutants which eliminate UMP-nsp8 labeling also eliminate higher molecular-weight proteinprimed products, but do not abolish the synthesis of poly(U) products (Figure S3A,C-F). This indicates that
two distinct priming mechanisms coexist: one NiRAN dependent promoted by UMP-nsp8 (pathway 1), and
the other NiRAN independent (pathway 2).
The SARS-CoV RTC synthesizes 5'-triphophate dinucleotide primers in a NiRAN-independent
manner
We noted that for NiRAN mutant RTCs, polymerization through pathway 2 was actually increased,
indicating that the two initiation mechanisms occur simultaneously and in competition (Figure S3C). NiRAN
mutant RTCs also produced higher quantities of a small molecular-weight UMP-containing product, thus
potentially involved in the second priming pathway. This product was identified as pppUpU based on its
sensitivity to Calf Alkaline phosphatase and nuclease P1, as well as co-migration with chemically
synthesized pppUpU. Addition of free pppUpU to the RTC increases synthesis of unbound poly(U) n RNA
products, and decreases the lag time of the reaction in a concentration dependent manner, showing that
synthesis of a dinucleotide pppUpU is a prerequisite for pathway 2 (Figure S4A,B). As expected, an RdRp
active site mutant of nsp12 (SDD -> SAA) abolishes poly(U) synthesis, and additionally eliminates synthesis
of pppUpU (Figure S3C). This confirms that it is the RdRp domain of nsp12, in conjunction with nsp7 and 8,
that drives production of this dinucleotide primer, and not the NiRAN.

Nsp12-mediated pppGpU synthesis directs the precise start of primer elongation on (-)ssRNA
sequence
To better understand how the two pathways are regulated during minus strand synthesis, we used a
heteropolymeric RNA corresponding to the last 20 nucleotides of the 3'-end of the genome (ST20) with or
without a poly(A)15 tail. In the absence of the poly(A) sequence, spurious self-primed products are
synthesized, and can be eliminated by blocking the 3’ end of the template (Figure S4C). Strikingly, we
observe that in the presence of the poly(A) 15 tail, synthesis is initiated in the vicinity of the RNA-poly(A)
junction, rather than from the end of the poly(A) sequence as judged by the size of the synthesis product
(Figure 3A, -ve panel). This indicates that the poly(A) tail and 3’ genomic RNA sequence elements guide the
positioning of the RTC to the true 3’-end of the genome, i.e., at its junction with the poly(A) tail, for
initiation of synthesis. Pre-incubation of the complex with UTP can additionally promote low-level synthesis
of the full-length template (ST20 + poly(A) 15) through the protein-primed pathway 1, which is released
following proteinase K digestion (Figure S4C). Western blot analysis confirms that the full-length RNA
product is covalently attached to nsp8, and that this is dependent on the NiRAN domain (Figure S2C).
To determine the precise sequence initiation site, we supplemented the reaction with various chemically
synthesized pppNpN dinucleotide primers. Addition of pppGpU, the sequence complementary to the last two
bases immediately adjacent to the poly(A) tail, greatly increased both the reaction rate and level of product
formation (Figure 3A). In contrast, pppUpU, pppUpG and pppApU dinucleotides had a minimal effect on the
reaction. We conclude that the polymerase complex preferably initiates synthesis with a pppGpU
dinucleotide, templated from the precise 3’ end of the genome-poly(A) junction, immediately upstream the
poly(A) tail. Synthesis of this dinucleotide is presumed to be the rate-limiting step, and can be surpassed
through the addition of free pppGpU. Interestingly, in contrast to pppUpU, free pppGpU is not readily
observed, indicating that it remains bound in the polymerase active site and is rapidly extended upon
production. In contrast, pppUpU appears to be synthesized more efficiently, however it is released by the
polymerase RTC, indicating that it is sub-optimal to start (-)RNA synthesis. Figure 3B recapitulates both
pathways operating in parallel at the 3'-end of the SARS-CoV genome. Altogether, our results show that the
SARS-CoV RTC promotes RNA synthesis initiation through two distinct pathways: pathway 1 is through
protein-priming reminiscent of Picornaviridae, and pathway 2 is by means of de novo synthesis of pppNpN
primers, pppGpU being preferred to start at the genome-poly(A) junction.

AT-9010 and STP terminate RNA synthesis but are excised by SARS-CoV nsp14 Exonuclease
Given the specific role of UTP and GTP in the (-)RNA priming event, we sought to determine whether
uracil- or guanine- nucleoside/tide analogues (NAs) could inhibit priming activity. Since most NAs
generally exert an antiviral effect by targeting the viral RdRp for incorporation into viral RNA (Pruijssers
and Denison, 2019), it was of particular interest to establish whether the NiRAN domain would additionally
constitute an antiviral target.
We investigated the inhibition potential of the active metabolites of two NAs; the uracil analogue Sofosbuvir
(SOF) and its guanosine equivalent AT-511. SOF is clinically approved for the treatment of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) (Dousson, 2018), however has shown limited efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Good et al.,
2021; Han et al., 2021), Han 2021). In contrast, AT-527 (the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511) was recently
shown to act as a potent broad-spectrum anti-CoV inhibitor in a variety of cell lines. It is now in phase II
clinical trials for the treatment of both HCV infection (Good et al., 2020) and COVID-19 (Good et al., 2020).
Both SOF and AT-511 are phosphoramidate prodrugs containing a 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyl modified ribose,
with the only difference being the nucleobase (Figure S5A). In cells, these prodrugs are metabolized by
cellular kinases into active 5’-triphosphate forms (AT-9010 and STP, respectively), which presumably act as
substrates for the viral RdRp for incorporation into viral RNA, as has been shown for HCV (reviewed in

(Dousson, 2018)). We first compared the RdRp selectivity for these two NAs using the SARS-CoV RTC and
a heteropolymeric RNA primer/template pair (Shannon et al., 2020). Both AT-9010 and STP are
incorporated into RNA by the RdRp as a substitute for GTP or UTP, respectively, causing immediate chain
termination (Figure S5B). In the presence of GTP, AT-9010 is a competitive guanosine substrate,
discriminated 22-fold against GTP (Figure S5C). In contrast, STP:UTP competition experiments (20:1) show
STP is not competitive at this ratio (Figure S5D). However, following incorporation into RNA, both drugs
are excised by the SARS-CoV ExoN (Figure S5D), indicating that the SARS-CoV RTC proofreading
activity potentially jeopardizes their efficacy. It therefore seems unlikely that the potent anti-CoV activity of
AT-527 would solely be provided by RdRp-mediated incorporation of AT-9010 into RNA.

AT-9010 binds to the NiRAN active site, inhibiting nsp8-UMPylation (Pathway 1)
To determine whether either drug was able to additionally target the NiRAN transfer activity, we performed
competition experiments measuring the efficiency of nsp8-UMPylation in the presence of increasing
concentrations of AT-9010 or STP (Figure 4A, Figure S6A-C). Both drugs were able to inhibit labeling, in
contrast to m7GTP, used as a control. Interestingly, despite the preferential labeling of nsp8 with UMP, the
uracil analogue STP is ~4-5-fold less efficient at blocking nsp8 labeling than AT-9010, consistent at two
enzyme concentrations (1 µM and 5 µM nsp12, with 5-fold excess nsp8) (Figure 4A, Figure S6B). The
calculated IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of inhibition of nsp8-UMPylation by AT-9010 gives
IC50 values of approximately half the concentration of nsp12 (0.87 and 1.9 µM, respectively), indicating that
AT-9010 binds to the NiRAN domain at a roughly 1:1 stoichiometry, strongly outcompeting UTP.
Furthermore, given the excess of nsp8 in the reaction, these results suggest that AT-9010 remains stably
bound in the NiRAN active site, rather than being transferred to nsp8. Both STP and AT-9010 were
additionally shown to inhibit GMPylation of nsp8 (Figure S6C).
Thermal shift assays with nsp12 in the presence of MnCl 2 confirms that AT-9010 provides more
thermodynamic stability than any other native nucleotide (Figure 4B). Comparison of NiRAN and RdRp
active site mutants (K73A and SAA, respectively) shows that this stability increase is provided by AT-9010
binding preferentially into the NiRAN active site, rather than the RdRp active site. Both GTP- and AT-9010nsp12 complexes show an increase in stability compared with UTP or STP-bound complexes. Consistent
with inhibition results, these results indicate that guanosine is the preferred base of the NiRAN active site,
and the 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyl ribose modification of AT-9010 provides additional stability.

AT-9010 inhibits RNA synthesis through pathway 2
We additionally tested the ability of the two drugs to inhibit initiation of RNA synthesis from a poly(A) 27
template. Despite AT-9010 being a guanosine analogue, it inhibits synthesis of poly(U) n RNA equally as
well as STP (Figure 4C). The inhibition by AT-9010 shows that the majority of its inhibitory activity might
not be due to RdRp-mediated incorporation, as purine-purine mismatches (in this case AT-9010:A,
equivalent to G:A) would be significantly disfavored over the native UTP:A. Inhibition of RNA synthesis is
comparable with the nsp12 K73A mutant, indicating that inhibition cannot be allosteric via binding to the
NiRAN domain (Figure S6D). Rather, inhibition occurs through blocking RNA synthesis initiation at the
RdRp active site. The equivalent experiment with a poly(C) template, theoretically favoring AT-9010, shows
STP to be virtually inactive, while AT-9010 significantly reduces activity (Figure 4D). It therefore appears
that while both drugs are able to inhibit de novo, NiRAN-independent initiation of RNA synthesis, AT-9010
inhibition is somewhat template-independent. Preincubation of the complexes with either STP or AT-9010,
prior to addition of pppGpU and other NTPs inhibits synthesis of ST20p(A) 15 RNA at similar levels. Again,
inhibition is comparable with WT and K73A NiRAN mutant complexes, showing that both drugs are

additionally able to bind in the RdRp active site and prevent synthesis and/or binding of dinucleotide primers
(Figure 4E).

Structural basis for nsp12 inhibition by AT-9010
Previously reported structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RTC in the presence and absence of RNA (Gao et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020) have paved the way to understand inhibition at a structural level (Yin et al., 2020).
To investigate the binding and incorporation into RNA of AT-9010, and in particular the relationship
between the RdRp and NiRAN active sites in its presence, we performed Cryo-EM studies using a dsRNAbound to the SARS-CoV-2 RTC in the presence of AT-9010. Image processing of single particles allowed
the reconstruction of a RTC/RNA/AT-9010 quaternary complex at 2.98 Å resolution (Table S1, Figure S7),
showing AT-9010 simultaneously binding to both NiRAN and RdRp active site of nsp12 (Figure 5). The
overall structure resembles previously reported structures, with one nsp12, one nsp7 and two nsp8 proteins
(Figure 5A). The RdRp domain is bound to a primer-template dsRNA pair, with the 5'-monophosphate of
AT-9010 incorporated at the 3’ end of the RNA primer (Figure 5B,C). A second, free AT-9010 triphosphate
is present, being loaded into the polymerase at the NTP binding site (framed from left by motif C, bottom by
motifs A, D, and top by motif F) (Figure 5C,D). Residues Asp618 and Asp760 of motifs A and C,
respectively, coordinate a single catalytic magnesium ion, which interacts with the phosphates of the second
AT-9010 (Figure 5D, Figure 6). Finally, the structure also shows AT-9010, bound in the active site of the
NiRAN domain (Figure 5E).

The nsp12 active site incorporates AT-9010 into RNA and terminates synthesis
The visible 5’-end of the RNA templates is composed of 4 consecutive cytidine bases (C24-C27) designed to
favor the incorporation of AT-9010 into the RNA product strand. AT-9010 is incorporated at position +1 of
the RNA product, pairing with C27 of the template strand. A second AT-9010 is observed in a preincorporation state partially pairing with C26 of the template, and representing the first snapshot of a SARSCoV-2 polymerase inhibited as such: the RdRp-RNA complex is stalled in a post-translocation state, with the
-1 site is occupied by the second AT-9010, poised for incorporation, and preventing other NTPs from being
loaded (Figure 5D, Figure 6A).
The guanine of the incorporated AT-9010 is canonically base-paired with the cytosine (C27) of the template
(Figure 5C,D). The ribose forms hydrogen bonds with Ser814 and the 5’ phosphate, coordinated by Cys813.
The effect of the 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyl ribose modification is two-fold. Firstly, the replacement of the 2’
hydroxyl by a fluoro group eliminates the interaction between Ser759 (motif C) and the 2’-OH, which
usually stabilizes the ribose. This sterically displaces the catalytic ions that are normally coordinated by
residues of motif C and the RNA product. This observation is corroborated by the lack of a second catalytic
Mg2+ in the structure, that is usually coordinated by the catalytic Asp760 in motif C and with the 3’-OH and
phosphate of the last incorporated nucleotide of the RNA product (Figure 6B). This ion plays a critical role
in the positioning of the 3’ end of the RNA product and the incoming NTP. Secondly, the hydrophobic
methyl group of the AT-9010 ribose amplifies the inhibitory effect by creating a hydrophobic hindrance that
prevents correct positioning of the ribose of the incoming NTP. This prevents further elongation of the
product strand, irrespective of the presence of a 3'-OH, explaining why AT-9010 acts as a chain terminator.
As a result, the second triphosphate AT-9010 is stalled at the -1 site position. The ribose ring is pushed away
compared to its theoretical position due to hydrophobic repulsion, mostly driven by the methyl group of the
incorporated AT-9010 (Figure 6C). As a result, the side chain of Asp623 (motif A), usually responsible for
stabilising the pyrophosphate after incorporation, is also pushed away. The guanine is partially base-paired
with the cytosine (C26) of the template strand, and is further stabilized by residues Lys545 (motif F) and

Ser682 (motif B), two residues important during the fidelity check, prior to incorporation (Figure 5D, Figure
6B).
The α- and β- phosphates are coordinated by the Mg2+ and the γ-phosphate is stabilized by the Lys621 also
in motif A and Lys798 in motif D. The distances between the α-phosphate and the 3’-OH necessary to allow
metal coordination and the bonding event (for incorporation) are not respected, preventing incorporation.
Rather we observe that AT-9010 has its α- and β-phosphates spatially overlapping the position of a
pyrophosphate (β- and γ-phosphates) (Figure 6C).

The NiRAN domain binds AT-9010 at the UMPylation active site
The NiRAN domain is structurally related to the pseudo-kinase family of enzymes (Slanina et al., 2021),
allowing delineation of the catalytic residues of the enzyme (Figure S8A). However, CoV-unique sequence
and structural elements can also be identified for the NiRAN domain. The structure shows AT-9010 in its
diphosphate form, bound to the NiRAN domain. The binding site is made of a closed cavity, which opens
into a groove harbouring two catalytic ions coordinated by the conserved Asn209 and Asp218. The groove
further widens to a flat surface formed by the 2 -strands (β2-β3 residues 33-48) (Figure S8B,C). The base
and the modified ribose of AT-9010 fits snuggly in the cavity (Figure 7A,B), while the α and β phosphates
are coordinated in the groove by the two catalytic ions and Lys73. The guanine base is intensively stabilized
by hydrophobic interaction and through hydrogen bonding with residues Arg55, Thr120 and Tyr217,
residues which are conserved in CoV- NiRAN sequences (Figure 7), but are not present in other pseudokinases (Figure S8A). The binding mode of AT-9010 is reminiscent of the orientation of ATP bound to the
casein kinase (Xu et al., 1995) but strikingly different from the position of the nucleotide in the pseudokinase structures (Sreelatha et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020) and a recently published GDP-bound NiRAN
structure (Figure S8C) (Yan et al., 2021). In contrast to the AT-9010-bound NiRAN reported here, the
diphosphate moiety of GDP was buried in the closed cavity formed by Lys50, Asn52, Lys73, and Arg 116,
and was coordinated by a single Mg 2+ ion (Figure 7). Similarly, the pseudo-kinase structures with a nonhydrolysable NTP show the γ-phosphate binding in a cavity formed by equivalent residues, with the ribose
stabilized along a wide surface close to the groove (Figure S8C). It is thus reasonable to propose that AT9010 has a unique binding mode, driven by both the hydrophobic nature of the cavity and the modified
ribose. The base and ribose are stabilised in the cavity by conserved residues, accounting for a potent
inhibition of the NiRAN function, consistent with enzymatic inhibition and thermal shift data.

Discussion
Here, we show that the SARS-CoV RTC can initiate RNA synthesis through two independent pathways,
mimicking viral (-)RNA synthesis. Both pathways are sensitive to AT-9010, and to a lesser extent STP,
supporting a new antiviral mechanism for these nucleotide analogues.
It is intriguing that two separate mechanisms operate to launch synthesis of the (-)RNA strand. The
preferential initiation at either a poly(A) sequence (protein-primed) or at the genome-poly(A) junction via
pppGpU dinucleotide synthesis (de novo) suggests these two pathways are not redundant. Rather, this may
serve as a mechanism to regulate continuous vs discontinuous viral RNA synthesis, for generation of fulllength genomic RNA and sgRNAs, respectively. Of note, for (+)RNA viruses, cellular levels of positivesense RNA are significantly higher than that of negative-sense RNA. This may explain why nsp8-linked
viral genomes have been difficult to detect, in contrast to Picornaviruses which use a VPg to prime both plus
and minus strand synthesis. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that nsp8-UMPylation and
subsequent protein-priming is used in viral factories to initiate synthesis of poly(U)-containing sequences
complementary to polyadenylated cellular mRNAs, thus serving as an immune decoy mechanism.
The UMPylation of nsp8 and resulting protein-primed pathway represents a first convincing role for the
transferase-related activity of the NiRAN domain. Given its structural relatedness to the SelO family of
pseudo-kinases, including YdiU which was recently shown to UMPylate up to 56 different peptides in
response to stress (Sreelatha et al., 2018), it seems plausible that NiRAN-mediated UMPylation of other
viral, and potentially host proteins may serve additional roles in the viral life-cycle. The labeling of nsp8 at
different and/or multiple sites may additionally serve as a regulatory mechanism for its activity. Nsp8 is
multimeric in solution, and additionally is known to form hexamers with nsp7. Differential UMPylation sites
and levels may therefore serve to modulate its activity, as is the case for the E.coli glutamine synthetase
enzyme, whose activity is dependent on the number of AMPylated subunits in the oligomeric structure (Itzen
et al., 2011). The NiRAN domain has additionally been proposed to play a role in the capping pathway as a
guanyltransferase (Yan et al., 2021), which may explain the increased stability provided by GTP binding
compared with UTP, and the specificity for these two nucleotides. The preference for two distinct
nucleobases (i.e., a purine and a pyrimidine) is not unheard of. For example, YdiU was recently shown to use
both ATP and UTP as substrates, with self-AMPylation used as a mechanism to downregulate its
UMPylation activity. In the case of CoVs, the switch between GTase and UMP-transferase activities may be
regulated by other viral protein(s), such nsp9 (Slanina et al., 2021) which have also been reported to be
UMPylated by nsp12. Of note, (Slanina et al., 2021) did not identify nsp8 as a target for NiRAN-mediated
UMPylation, which we attribute to the presence of a C-terminal His-tag precluding nsp8-labeling.
Despite the preferential labeling of nsp8 by UTP, GTP is seen to be the more stably-bound substrate in the
NiRAN active site. In accordance, inhibition assays and thermal shift data reflect the preferential binding of
the guanosine analogue AT-9010 over its uridine equivalent STP. This is logical given the more transient
UTP binding required to facilitate transfer to nsp8, and suggests that two NTP-binding modes exist,
dependent on the nucleobase. It thus seems likely that guanosine NAs are the best candidates for NiRANbased inhibition. Of note, m7GTP did not inhibit nsp8-UMPylation, suggesting that more stringent selection
occurs on the base rather than on the ribose. In the case of AT-9010, structural analysis shows that the 2’fluoro-2’-C-methyl ribose modification is well accommodated in the NiRAN active site and provides
additional interactions which likely contribute to its stability.
Furthermore, AT-9010 additionally targets the RdRp-domain for incorporation into viral RNA causing
immediate chain termination, and impeding de novo synthesis initiation. Treatment of CoV-infections with
NAs has been largely complicated by the presence of the ExoN activity. The pleiotropic action of AT-9010,
in its dual targeting of NiRAN and RdRp domains, should attenuate the chance of resistance mutations. Our
structural and functional description of its mechanism of action should aid further design of potent drugs, and

Material and Methods
5'-triphosphate nucleosides
AT-9010, 5'-triphosphate 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyl uridine, and Remdesivir 5'-triphosphate were from
NuBlocks LLC, Oceanside, CA, USA. Other NTPs were purchased from GE Healthcare. 5’-TP dinucleotides
were purified by semi-preparative IEX-HPLC with a UHPLC Thermoscientific Ultimate 3000 system
equipped with a HPG-3200 BX pump, a DAD 3000 detector, a WPS-3000TBRS Autosampler, a fraction
collector F, using a DNAPac PA200 column (22 x 250 mm). Elution was performed with buffer A: 5%
CH3CN in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and buffer B: 5% CH 3CN containing 400 mM LiClO4 in 25 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8 at a 9 mL.min-1 flow rate. The crude dinucleotides were purified using a 0 - 15% linear gradient of
buffer B in buffer A in 25 min at 25°C. The pure fractions were pooled in a 100 mL round bottomed flask
and were evaporated under reduced pressure with a bath at 30°C maximum. The residue was desalted using a
C18 cartridge Sep-Pak® Classic. The residue was dissolved in 1.2 mL water (divided in 3 portions of 0.4 mL
for flask rinse), transferred to a 2 mL Eppendorf-vial and lyophilized from water. Pure 5’-TP dinucleotides
were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Axima Assurance spectrometer equipped
with 337 nm nitrogen laser (Shimadzu Biotech, UK) using a 10:1 (m/m) mixture of 2,4,6trihydroxyacetophenone/ammonium citrate as a saturated solution in acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) for the
matrix. Analytical samples were mixed with the matrix in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, crystallized on a 100-well
stainless-steel plate and analyzed. UV quantification of 5’-TP dinucleotides was performed on a UV-1600
PC spectrometer (VWR) by measuring absorbance at 260 nm.
Dinucleotide synthesis
Chemical synthesis of 5’-triphosphate (TP) dinucleotides pppUpU, pppUpG, pppGpU and pppApU were
performed on an ABI 394 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) from long chain alkylamine controlled-pore
glass (LCAA-CPG) solid support with a pore size of 1000 Å derivatized through the succinyl linker with 5’O-dimethoxytrityl-2’-O-acetyl-[uridine or N2-isopropylphenoxyacetyl guanosine] (Link Technologies).
Dinucleotides were assembled on a 1-mole scale in Twist oligonucleotide synthesis columns (Glen
Research)
using
the
5’-O-DMTr-2’-O-pivaloyloxymethyl-3’-O-(Ocyanoethyl-N,Ndiisopropylphosphoramidite)-[uridine or N2-isopropylphenoxyacetyl guanosine or N6-phenoxyacetyl
adenosine] (Chemgenes). After assembly, the CPG beads were dried under a stream of argon. A solution (2
mL) of 1 M diphenyl phosphite (0.4 mL) in dry pyridine (1.6 mL) was passed manually with a plastic
syringe through the Twist column and left to stand for 30 min at 40°C. The CPG was then washed with
acetonitrile and a 0.1 M solution of triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB, pH 7.5) was applied to the
column and left to react for 45 min at 40°C. After several washings, an oxidation solution containing
imidazole (150 mg) in N,O-bis-trimethylsilylacetamide (0.4 mL), acetonitrile (0.8 mL),
bromotrichloromethane (0.8 mL) and triethylamine (0.1 mL) was added under argon and left to react for 2 h
at 40°C. After washing and drying the support, a solution containing bis(tri-n-butylammonium)
pyrophosphate (88 mg, 0.15 mmol) in dry DMF (0.5 mL) was applied to the column and left to react for 18 h
at 40°C. The solution was removed, and the support was washed with dry acetonitrile. The CPG beads were
dried by blowing argon through them for 1 min. 5’-TP dinucleotides were deprotected and released from the
solid-support using a 1 M solution of 1,8-diazadicyclo-[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) (0.3 mL) in anhydrous
acetonitrile (1.7 mL) for 3 min then the CPG beads were transferred into a glass vial and a 30 % aqueous
ammonia solution (2 mL) was applied for 3 h at 40°C. The ammonia solution was collected in a 100 mL
round bottomed flask and was evaporated and co-evaporated with water under reduced pressure with a bath
at 30°C maximum. The residue was dissolved in water (1.8 mL divided into four portions for flask rinse: 0.6
mL, 0.4 mL, 0.4 mL, 0,4 mL), transferred to 2 mL Eppendorf-vials and then lyophilized from water.

SARS-CoV cofactor proteins nsp7(TEV)6His, 6His(TEV)nsp8 and nsp7L8(TEV)6His were expressed under
the control of a T5-promoter in pQE30 vectors in Escherichia coli (E. coli) NEB Express C2523 cells (New
England Biolabs) carrying the pRARE2LacI (Novagen) plasmid. Protein was expressed overnight at 17°C
(with 100 µg/mL Ampicillin and 17 µg/mL Chloramphenicol), following induction with 100 µM IPTG at an
OD600 = 0.5 – 0.6. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10
mM Imidazole, supplemented with 20 mM MgSO 4, 0.25 mg/mL Lysozyme, 10 μgg/mL DNase and 1 mM
PMSF) and protein was purified through affinity chromatography with TALON® Superflow™ cobalt-based
IMAC resin (Cytiva). A wash step with buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl was performed prior to
elution with 200 mM imidazole. The affinity tag was removed via overnight cleavage with TEV protease
(1:10 w/w ratio to TEV:protein) in a dialysis buffer containing no imidazole and supplemented with 1 mM
DTT. Cleaved protein was re-purified through a second cobalt column to remove the histidine-labelled TEV
protease, and further purified with size exclusion chromatography (Cytiva Superdex S200) in a final buffer
of 25 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 5 mM TCEP. SARS-CoV nsp12-8His was
expressed from a pJ404 vector in E. coli strain BL21/pG-Tf2 (Takara 9124), in the presence of Ampicillin
(100 µM/mL) and Chloramphenicol (17 µg/mL). Expression was induced at OD600= 0.5-0.6 with 250 µM
IPTG and 5 ng/ml of tetracycline for induction of chaperones proteins (groES-groEL-tig), and left overnight

mL Lysozyme, 10 μgg/mL Dnase, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM Benzamidine. Nucleic acid was precipitated through
the gradual addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 1 M. Following centrifugation (30000 x g for 30min),
the supernatant was diluted to reduce NaCl concentration to 300 mM. Protein was purified using cobaltbased IMAC resin TALON® Superflow ™ (Cytiva), washing 3 times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8,
10% glycerol) with alternating NaCl concentration (300 mM, 1 M, 300 mM) before elution with 200 mM
Imidazole. Protein was further purified through size exclusion chromatography (Cytiva Superdex S200) in a
the same final buffer as 7 and 8 cofactor proteins, supplemented with 10% glycerol. Concentrated aliquots of
nsp12, 7, 8 and 7L8 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ° C. SARS-CoV cofactor protein
nsp10 was expressed under the control of a Tet-promoter in a pASK vector in E. coli NEB Express C2523
cells (New England Biolabs) carrying the pRare2LacI (Novagen) plasmid. Protein was expressed overnight
at 17°C (with 50 µM/mL kanamycin, 17 µg/mL Chloramphenicol), following induction with 200 µg/L
Tetracycline at an OD600 = 0.6-0.7. Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM of β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mg/mL Lysozyme, 10 μgg/mL
DNase, 0.1% triton and 1 mM PMSF) and lysed by sonication. Protein was purified first through affinity
chromatography with HisPur Cobalt resin (Thermo Scientific), eluted in 100 mM imidazole, then through
size exclusion chomatography (GE Superdex S200) in a final buffer of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM of β-mercaptoethanol. SARS-CoV nsp14 was expressed from a pDEST14
vector in E. coli strain NEB Express C2566 cells (New England Biolabs) carrying the pRare2, in the
presence of Ampicillin (100 µM/mL) and Chloramphenicol (17 µg/mL). Protein expression was induced at
an OD600 = 0.8 with 2 µM IPTG, and left overnight at 17°C with shaking. Cells were lysed by sonication in a
buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL
Lysozyme, 10 μgg/mL DNase and 1 mM PMSF. The protein was purified through affinity chromatography
with HisPur Cobalt resin (Thermo Scientific), washing with an increased concentration of salt (1 M NaCl),
prior to elution in buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The protein was further purified by a size
exclusion chomatography (GE Superdex S200) in a final buffer of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl.

infection at 27 °C and were centrifugation at 4,500 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer
(50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2mM MgCl 2, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Tablet)
and homogenized with High Pressure Homogenizer at 4℃. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 60
min at 4℃. The fusion protein was first purified by Strep-Tactin (Strep-Tactin®XT) affinity chromatography
and the tag was removed by incubation of TEV protease overnight at 4℃ after elution. The protein was
reloaded onto a Heparin HP column after buffer exchanged to buffer A (50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 150mM
NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2mM MgCl2). Flow through was collected and loaded on to a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex
200 pg column (GE healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2.
Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 6.86 mg/ml and stored at -80°C. The gene of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7
(residues 1-83) possessing a C-terminal Avi-6Histag (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHEHHHHHH) was cloned into a
modified pET-32a vector. BL21(E. coli, T7 Express) containing the plasmid were grown to an OD600 of 0.6
at 37 °C, and protein was expressed at 15 °C for 16 h after the addition of isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The cells were harvested then resuspended
in buffer B (50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10mM imidazole). Cells were disrupted

followed by a Superdex HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE Healthcare, USA) in buffer C (10mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150mM NaCl). Purified nsp7 was concentrated to 7.27mg/ml and stored at -80°C. The
gene of SARS-CoV-2 nsp8 (residues 1-198) was cloned into a modified pET-28a vector containing an Nterminal His6-flag-tag with a TEV cleavage site (HHHHHHDYK DDDDKENLYFQG) for expression in E.

D (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500mM NaCl, 5% glycerol). Cells were lysed using a High-Pressure
Homogenizer at 4 °C. Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm, 60 min at 4°C. Supernatant
was applied onto a Talon affinity chromatography column and tag was removed by on-column cleavage
overnight using TEV protease. The mixture was buffer exchanged to buffer D and reloaded onto a Hischelating NTA column again to remove the His tag and TEV protease. Target protein was further purified by
passage through a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg (GE Healthcare, USA) in buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol). The fractions near the maximum height of the peak were combined and
further purified by a Mono Q 10/100 GL column (GE Healthcare, USA). Buffer exchange to buffer E.
Purified nsp8 was buffer exchanged to buffer E, then concentrated to 11.63 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C.

Thermal shift assays
The influence of compound binding on protein stability was measured by Themofluor assay, using a CFX
Connect BioRad real-time PCR machine, at a protein concentration of 2 µM (nsp12 WT and mutants) in a
buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 supplemented or not by 0.5 mM
MnCl2 freshly prepared. Compounds and NTPs concentration was fixed at 100 µM. In 96-well thin-walled
PCR plates, 2 µL of inhibitors or NTPS were added to 16 µL of buffer follow by the addition of 2 µL of
protein. Finally, 2 µL of the fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange was added (5-fold final). Melting-temperature

Standard nucleotide transfer reactions were performed at 37°C for reaction times ranging from 2 – 60 min, in
a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 - 2 mM MnCl 2, 1 – 5 µCi α32P-NTP and 30 mM
NaCl with final protein concentrations of 1 µM nsp12 and/or 3 µM cofactors. For analysis of labeling only,
samples were stopped in a 2X concentration of SDS-loading dye and heated at 95°C for 5 mins, to ensure
only covalently-bound NMP remained bound to protein. Proteins were analyzed on 15% SDS PAGE gels,
stained with InstantBlue for total protein and exposed for 2 hrs – overnight to reveal radiolabeled proteins.
For assessment of nsp8-UMP bond stability, nsp8 was first labeled in a reaction containing only nsp12
protein, or with the full RTC comprised of nsp12:nsp7L8:nsp8 in the presence of RNA. Reactions were heat
inactivated at 70°C for 10 mins, then incubated with either 0.1M HCl or 0.1M NaOH for 1 hour at 30°C.
Following incubation, the pH was neutralized with an equivalent concentration of acid or base, and samples
were analyzed by SDS PAGE, as above. Competition experiments with AT-9010 and STP were run in the
same conditions as above, at two enzyme concentrations, 1 µM or 5 µM of nsp12 with 5-fold molar excess of
nsp8. A constant concentration of either GTP or UTP (5 µM), supplemented with 5 µCi α32P-NTP was used,
with varied concentrations of NA inhibitor. Reactions were stopped after either 15 min – 1 hr incubation, and
analyzed on 15% SDS PAGE gels. Nsp8-UMPylation or GMPylation was calculated as a percentage relative
to the no-inhibitor controls. Reactions were performed in triplicate with 6-7 concentrations of NA.

Primer-independent polymerization assays
Poly(N)27 and oligonucleotide substrates corresponding to the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV genome (with or
without a poly(A)15 tail) were purchased from Biomers (HPLC grade). The active RTC was formed by first
incubating nsp7 and 8 together at equimolar concentrations (100 µM) for 30 mins at room temperature.
Nsp12, extra nsp8 and protein gel filtration buffer were added to form a final complex consisting of
nsp12:7:8 at a 1:3:6 ratio, with 10 µM nsp12. The complex was further incubated for 10 mins at room
temperature, and used at a final concentration of 1 µM nsp12. Primer-independent assays were performed in
the same conditions used for nucleotidyl transferase reactions, but supplemented with 100 – 200 µM cold
NTP and 0.7 µM final concentration of RNA. Reactions were stopped at indicated time-points in either 2X
concentration of SDS loading buffer for protein analysis, or a 2X-4X volume of FBD stop solution
(formamide, 10 mM EDTA) for analysis on 14% acrylamide, 7M urea sequencing gels. For proteinase K
digestions, reactions were first stopped by heat-inactivation at 10 mins at 70°C. Digestion was performed for
2 hours at 37°C in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 0.5 % SDS. Nuclease P1 (NEB) were
performed as per manufacturer's instructions. For order of addition experiments, protein was pre-incubated in
reaction buffer for 30 min at 37 °C with either UTP or RNA. Following incubation, the inverse reagent was
added to start the reaction. AT-9010 and STP inhibition was tested with a constant concentration of 200 µM
cold NTP and varied concentrations of inhibitor. Inhibitor, NTP and RNA were incubated together in assay
buffer, and reactions were started via addition of the protein complex. For analysis of covalent binding to
nsp8 with western blotting, polymerase assays were performed in the buffer described above. Nsp12:7:8
complex was preincubated with 200 µM UTP for 30 min at 37°C prior to addition of 2 µM poly(A)27,
ST20poly(A)15 or ST20 RNA. Reactions were either stopped immediately after RNA addition (time 0), or
after 60 min incubation at 37°C in 2X SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in TBS-Tween (0.1%) containing 5% skim milk powder
overnight. Nsp8 was probed with mouse monoclonal anti-nsp8 (5A10) from GeneTex (GTX632696), and
HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary (Agilent Dako), washing 3X in PBS.T between each antibody.
Nsp8 was revealed with Immobilon Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore).
Primer-dependent polymerization and excision assays

Primer-template (10:20) pairs, corresponding to the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV genome, were annealed at a
molar ratio of 1:1.5 in 110 mM KCl at 70 °C for 10 min, then cooled slowly to room temperature over
several hours. Hairpin RNAs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The
nsp12:7:8 RTC was formed as for the primer-independent polymerase assays, then preincubated with RNA
in a pre-mix containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2. For single nucleotide
incorporation assays, reactions were initiated with 50 µM (final concentration) of all AT-9010 or STP, with
or without the following nucleotide (ATP). Final reaction concentrations were 0.5 µM nsp12, 0.4 µM RNA.
Reactions were quenched at indicated timepoints with 5X volume of FBD stop solution (formamide, 10 mM
EDTA). For AT-9010 – GTP competition experiments, protein-RNA complexes were preincubated as
described above, and initiated with either all four NTPs, or with only CTP, UTP and ATP (50 µM each
NTP), supplemented with various concentrations of AT-9010 (10 – 250 µM). To calculate the discrimination
between AT-9010 and GTP, the AT-9010 product band (from 50 or 250 µM concentrations) was compared
with the sum of fractions of product bands derived from GTP incorporation at three timepoints.
Discrimination was corrected to account for concentration difference between AT-9010 and GTP. For
analogue excision, polymerization reactions were performed on hairpin RNAs in the same conditions as
described above, then stopped by heating at 70°C for 10 min. The hairpin was re-annealed at 30° for >30
min, and 50 nM nsp14/nsp10 (1:5) were added for time-course reactions. Aliquots were analyzed using
denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20 % acrylamide, 7M urea) and visualized using a Typhoon
FluorImager.
Assembly of the extended nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA complex for Cryo-EM
To assemble the extended RdRp complex, nsp12 was incubated with nsp7 and nsp8 at 4 °C for 3 h with a
molar ratio of 1: 3: 6 in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 4 mM
DTT. Then the mixture was purified by Mono Q 5/50 GL ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare,
USA), resulting in a stable nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex. The protein complex was desalted to buffer F ( 25mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 4 mM DTT). Purified RdRp complex were buffer
exchanged to 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 4m M DTT and concentrated to 10
mg/ml for Cryo-EM experiments. A 30-mer oligoribonucleotide template and a 20-mer oligoribonucleotide
primer were chemically synthesized by GenScript. The template and primer oligoribonucleotides were
annealed by heating the solution to 95 °C and gradually cooling to 4 °C. The annealed RNA scaffold was
incubated with nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex for 30 min at 4 °C with a molar ratio of 2: 1 to form the nsp12nsp7-nsp8-RNA complex. AT9010 was added subsequently for compound incorporation.
Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
In total, 3 µL of protein solution at 5 mg/mL (with 0.025% DDM) was applied onto a glow-discharged holey
carbon grid (Quantifoil, 300 mesh, R1.2/1.3). Excess samples were blotted for 5.0 s with a blotting force of
3, then the remaining solution was vitrified by plunging into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo
Fischer Scientific) at 4 °C and 100% humidity. Cryo-EM data were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios
electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan,
USA) operating in a super-resolution counting mode. All movies were automatically recorded using
SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005) at a magnification of 105K, with a physical pixel size of 0.83 Å. A total dose
of 80.5 e-/ Å2 was fractionated into 50 frames. 7,459 movie micrographs were collected with a defocus range
from -1.5 µm to -2.5 µm, and the slit width of Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter (Gatan, USA) was set to be
20 eV. Statistics for data collection and refinement are shown in Table S1.
Cryo-EM image processing
All dose-fractioned movies were motion-corrected with Relion’s own implementation. CTF estimation,
2D classification, 3D classification and refinements were all performed in cryoSPARC. A total of 2,410,466

particles were auto-picked using blob picker and extracted with a box size of 320 pixels. 248,401 particles
were selected after three rounds of 2D classification based on the complex integrity. This particle set was
used for Ab-Initio reconstruction with three classes, which were then used as 3D volume templates for
heterogeneous refinement. The 3D volume corresponding to the intact nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA complex was
used for creating 100 2D projections which were then used as templates for template-based particle picking.
Approximately 3,640,595 particles were picked from a set of 3,622 micrographs filtered based on fitted
resolution better than 5 Å as estimated by CTFFIND4, using template picker. Particles were extracted with a
box size of 360 pixels. A total of 234,421 particles were selected after four rounds of 2D classification based
on the complex integrity. This particle set was used for Ab-Initio reconstruction with three classes, followed
by heterogeneous refinement. A subset of 181,669 particles from the class with good features was subjected
to Homogeneous Refinement, Local Refinement and Non-uniform Refinement, resulting in a 2.98 Å map.
Model building and refinement
To build the model of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8-RNA complex, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8RNA complex (from PDB 7CYQ with one nsp9 and nsp13 removed) was placed and rigid-body fitted into
the Cryo-EM map using UCSF Chimera. The model was manually built in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) with
the guidance of the Cryo-EM map, and in combination with real space refinement using Phenix (Afonine et
al., 2018). The model validation statistics are shown in Table S1.

inhibitor or m7GTP. Total intensity of labeling was quantified with ImageQuant software, and plotted at %
residual activity. Calculated IC50 values were (B) 1.9 ± 0.1 and 8.2 ± 1.4 for AT-9010 and STP,
respectively, in competition with UTP. (C) 2.7 ± 0.3 and 5 ± 0.8 for AT-9010 and STP, respectively, in
competition with GTP. Data was calculated from two individual replic(Hartenian et al., 2020)ates, with a
minimum of 6-points per replicate. (D) Inhibition of WT or K73A NiRAN mutant RTCs with varied
concentrations of AT-9010 or STP, using both poly(A) 27 and poly(C)27 templates in the presence of UTP and
GTP, respectively (200 µM, supplemented with α32P-NTP).

Figure S7. Cryo-EM data processing summary. (A) The flowchart shows the main steps in data
processing, from particle picking, through classification, to final maps. A selected subset of the initial
reference-free 2D class averages and all the intermediate 3D class averages computed during the processing
of this dataset are shown. All 3D class averages, selected for subsequent rounds of processing, are boxed in
red, and the percentage of number of particles in each of these is shown. Further attempts to process the
discarded classes are omitted from this chart for clarity, as these data did not contribute to the final particle
set. (B-E) Map and model quality of the nps12-nsp7-nsp8/RNA/AT9010 complex. (B) FSC curves for the
final reconstruction. The resolution of the map is 2.98 Å as calculated by the gold-standard FSC 0.143
