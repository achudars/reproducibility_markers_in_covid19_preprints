SUMMARY
The etiologic agent of the Covid-19 pandemic is the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2
surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by
the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced
at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA
transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA
induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we
show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic
RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are
modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase
separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a
mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced
phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus
can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.

INTRODUCTION
The etiologic agent of the Covid-19 pandemic is the severe acute respiratory
syndrome

coronavirus

2

(SARS-CoV-2)

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). SARS-CoV-2 is
an enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a 30 kb genome, one of
the largest among RNA viruses (Virology.org, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). The viral
membrane of SARS-CoV-2, which contains the spike protein, a glycoprotein and the
envelope protein (Watanabe et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), surrounds a helical
nucleocapsid. In the nucleocapsid, the viral genome is encapsulated by the
nucleocapsid protein and thereby protected from the host cell environment (McBride
et al., 2014; Gralinski and Menachery, 2020). The nucleocapsid protein of human
coronaviruses is produced at high levels within infected cells and is critical for virion
assembly (McBride et al., 2014; Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Gralinski and Menachery,
2020; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, it enhances the efficiency of sub-genomic viral
RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication (McBride et al., 2014).
Because of its importance for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to treat Covid-19
(Burbelo et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020), there is an urgent need to define the molecular
mechanisms that underlie the nucleocapsid protein’s fundamental viral role.
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) provides a highly cooperative
mechanism to locally concentrate proteins and nucleic acids and promote cellular
reactions (Forman-Kay et al., 2018; Alberti et al., 2019). Recent evidence indicates
that negative-sense RNA viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells
(Novoa et al., 2005), concentrate their replication machinery in dynamic
compartments formed by LLPS of the viral structural proteins L, phosphoprotein (P)
and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Nikolic et al., 2017; Heinrich et al., 2018). The
genomes of positive-sense RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, however, lack the
genetic code for the phosphoprotein P, which is essential for LLPS in negative-sense
RNA viruses (Nikolic et al., 2017; Heinrich et al., 2018; Guseva et al., 2020).
Here we investigate liquid-liquid phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein
of SARS-CoV-2 and show that nucleocapsid protein LLPS concentrates components
of the SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery providing a mechanism for enhanced viral
transcription and replication.

RESULTS
LLPS of NSARS-CoV-2 and RNA into Protein/RNA-Dense Compartments
To investigate if the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 (further termed NSARS-CoV-2; Figure
1A) phase separates in the absence of other viral proteins, we measured the turbidity
of NSARS-CoV-2 solutions at different protein concentrations. Up to 50 µM, the protein
solution retained low absorbance (Figure 1B), despite its tendency to oligomerize (Ye
et al., 2020). Next we tested LLPS of NSARS-CoV-2 in the presence of RNA. The 419residue NSARS-CoV-2 contains an RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization
domain embedded into long intrinsically disordered regions (Figure 1A). The globular
domains as well as the intrinsically disordered regions of coronavirus N proteins bind
to RNA (McBride et al., 2014). At 50 µM protein concentration, addition of 1 µM
polyU (800 kDa) strongly increased turbidity (Figure 1B). Differential interference
contrast (DIC) and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated the formation of spherical
droplets (Figure 1C). The droplets contained both NSARS-CoV-2 and RNA (Figure 1C).
NSARS-CoV-2/polyU droplets were robust against the presence of the aliphatic alcohol
1,6-hexanediol (Figure S1A). In contrast, addition of increasing amounts of NaCl
dissolved the droplets (Figure S1B), indicating an important role of electrostatic
interactions for RNA-induced LLPS of NSARS-CoV-2. Quantification of fluorescence
intensities of NSARS-CoV-2 and RNA showed that their concentration is strongly
increased inside droplets (Figure 1D), i.e. cooperative LLPS of NSARS-CoV-2 and RNA
into protein/RNA-dense compartments occurs.
Next, we monitored LLPS for different NSARS-CoV-2 and polyU concentrations.
According to turbidity measurements, polyU-induced LLPS started at 5-10 µM
NSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B and S1C). The polyU concentration at which maximum
turbidity was observed shifted to higher polyU concentrations with increasing protein
concentration (Figure 1B and S1C). Calculation of the NSARS-CoV-2 and polyU charge
showed that LLPS is strongest when charge neutralization occurs (Figure 1B). At a
given protein concentration, the turbidity increased with increasing polyU
concentration, reached a maximum and then rapidly decreased to its starting value
(Figure 1B), i.e. charge-matching RNA concentrations enable phase separation, but
high RNA/protein ratios prevent LLPS of NSARS-CoV-2. The RNA-induced LLPS

behavior of NSARS-CoV-2 is in agreement with the known properties of RNA-induced
phase separation of prion-like RNA binding proteins (Maharana et al., 2018).

each time point. Representative micrographs of a fresh droplet (top) and after incubation for
one hour (bottom) before bleaching, after bleaching and at the end of recovery are displayed
to the right.

Time-Dependent Transformation of NSARS-CoV-2/RNA-Droplets
A characteristic property of LLPS is the liquid-like nature of phase-separated
compartments. We photobleached NSARS-CoV-2 inside of NSARS-CoV-2/polyU droplets
and observed rapid recovery of fluorescence (Figure 1E). Exponential fitting of the
recovery resulted in a diffusion coefficient of 0.198 ± 0.002 µm2/s. We then waited
one hour and repeated fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). At this
later time point, the fluorescence recovery was best described by a bi-exponential fit
consisting of two components with diffusion coefficients of 0.268 ± 0.063 µm2/s and
0.054 ± 0.020 µm2/s (Figure 1E and S1D). In addition, the fluorescence did not fully
recover (Figure 1E), i.e. ~60 % of NSARS-CoV-2 had transformed into an immobile
species. The analysis shows that NSARS-CoV-2/polyU droplets change their material
properties in a time-dependent manner. Because a major activity of NSARS-CoV-2 is to
encapsulate RNA, the immobile fraction observed by FRAP might represent early
stages of nucleocapsid assembly. Successful nucleocapsid formation, however, also
depends on the specific sequence and secondary structure of viral RNA (Zhou and
Routh, 2020) and is therefore not expected for polyU.

µm2/s) comprises ~65% of the bleached spot (mobile fraction). The remaining 35% are
immobile and do not recover its fluorescence after photobleaching.

SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Associates with Stress Granules
Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules, which form through
LLPS and are modulated by corona- and other viruses to maximize replication
efficiency (White and Lloyd, 2012). SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction mapping
indicated that NSARS-CoV-2 binds the SG protein G3BP1 (Gordon et al., 2020). To
investigate if NSARS-CoV-2 associates with SGs, we used a previously established SGcolocalization assay (Hofweber et al., 2018). SGs were induced in HeLa cells by
arsenite followed by permeabilization of the plasma membrane by digitonin.
Subsequently, soluble cytosolic factors were washed out and fluorescently labeled
NSARS-CoV-2 was added together with Alexa Fluor 594-coupled antibody against the SG

marker G3BP1. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that arsenite induced
formation of SGs that stained for G3BP1 (Figure 2A). NSARS-CoV-2 colocalized with
G3BP1-positive SGs (Figure 2A; Movie S1). FRAP of SG-associated NSARS-CoV-2
suggested the presence of three NSARS-CoV-2 populations (Figure 2B): a very mobile
with rapid fluorescence recovery, a slower diffusing component and an immobile
fraction, which does not recover its fluorescence after photobleaching (Figure 2C).
Because SGs consist of a rigid core and a dynamic shell (Jain et al., 2016), we
attribute the different NSARS-CoV-2 diffusion properties to the localization of NSARS-CoV2

to different sub-structures of SGs. In agreement with our findings for NSARS-CoV-2,

the N protein of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003,
translocates to SGs in stressed SARS-CoV-infected cells (Peng et al., 2008).
RNA-Interaction of the Mutation-Prone SR-Region
RNA viruses have enormously high mutation rates enhancing virulence and
evolvability. On June 7th 2020, already 42176 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were
deposited (https://www.gisaid.org). Analysis of the corresponding N proteins showed
that the mutations are most frequent in the SR-region of NSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3A),
which is conserved among human coronaviruses (Figure S2). SR-regions bind both
RNA and proteins (Wegener and Muller-McNicoll, 2019). To gain insight into the
molecular properties of the SR-region of NSARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with RNA, we
combined NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We
particularly focused on the region from A182 to S197, because it contains 9 serine
and 4 arginine residues, i.e. the highest density of SR-motifs in NSARS-CoV-2 (Figure
S2). Chemical shift analysis showed that residues A182-S197 are very dynamic with a
small propensity of α-helical structure next to R189 (Figure 3B-C).

frequency of mutations per residue (grey bars). At the left, a MD snapshot of five SR-peptides
with the 20 base length polyU is shown. See also Figures S3 and S4.

Next we investigated the conformational properties of A182-S197 with MD
simulations. For the simulations, we used the state-of-the art force field/water model
that accurately reproduced NMR parameters of the intrinsically disordered protein αsynuclein (Pietrek et al., 2020). In agreement with the NMR analysis, residues next to
R189 populate transient α-helical structure (Figure 3C). We then performed
calculations in the presence of polyU. A large number of intermolecular contacts
between the arginine residues and the RNA phosphate groups were observed. Most
intermolecular contacts were present for R189 (Figure 3D, red). In addition, R189
was most sensitive to the addition of polyU as observed by NMR spectroscopy
(Figure 3D, blue; Figure S3A). R189 is the only residue in the region from A182S197 that is not mutated in 42176 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Figure 3D, grey bars), in
agreement with its functional relevance.
SR-Phosphorylation Modulates RNA-Induced Phase Separation
Phosphorylation of SR-domains provides functional specificity and adjustability
to ribonucleoprotein formation (Wegener and Muller-McNicoll, 2019) and impairs
binding of SR-domains of pre-mRNA splicing factors to protein hydrogel droplets
(Kwon et al., 2014). To gain insight into the impact of phosphorylation of the SRregion of NSARS-CoV-2 on its RNA binding, we performed MD simulations of the highdensity SR-stretch carrying phosphate groups at different serine residues (Figure
S4A). Even when only a single serine, S188, was phosphorylated, the number of
intra- and intermolecular peptide/peptide contacts increased (Figure S4B-C). Multisite phosphorylation further raised the number of contacts (Figure S4B-C), and the
intermolecular peptide/peptide contacts reached a maximum when three serines were
phosphorylated (Figure S4C), i.e. when the overall charge is around zero. The
phosphorylation-induced

To validate the results from MD simulation, we phosphorylated the SRpeptide in vitro using the serine/arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) and performed
NMR spectroscopy. SRPK1 phosphorylates SR-motifs and is involved in a wide
spectrum of cellular activities including the regulation of viral genome replication
(Fukuhara

et

al.,

and

SRPK1-

phosphorylation resulted in two species, a single phosphorylation at S188 (Figure 4B,
middle) and a di-phosphorylated state, which is heterogeneously phosphorylated at
four different serines (Figure 4B, bottom). NMR titrations showed that the
unmodified SR-peptide strongly interacts with polyU, but not when it is
phosphorylated at S188 (Figure 4B and S3B). LLPS experiments further
demonstrated that phosphorylation of full-length NSARS-CoV-2 by SRPK1 changes its
RNA-induced phase separation behavior (Figure 4C). The maximum of RNA-induced
turbidity was shifted to lower polyU-concentrations for SRPK1-phosphorylated
NSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4C). In addition, co-localization of SRPK1-phosphorylated
NSARS-CoV-2 with stress granules was slightly attenuated (Figure 4D). The combined
data show that the SR-region is important for RNA-induced phase separation of
NSARS-CoV-2, but multiple domains of NSARS-CoV-2 contribute to its translocation to
stress granules. Phosphorylation and mutation in different regions of NSARS-CoV-2
(Figure 3A) are therefore poised to modulate viral replication.
Nucleocapsid Protein LLPS Concentrates Components of the SARS-CoV-2
Replication Machinery
LLPS provides a cooperative mechanism to locally increase protein and RNA
concentrations11,12. In addition, protein/RNA condensates can recruit additional
proteins to promote reactions. To investigate if the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp; Figure 5A) concentrates within NSARS-CoV-2/RNA droplets, we recombinantly
prepared the non-structural protein (nsp) 12 of SARS-CoV-2, together with the
accessory sub-units nsp7 and nsp8, which are required for transcription (Hillen et al.,
2020). First we used nsp12, in order to investigate if the catalytic component of RdRp
is recruited to NSARS-CoV-2/polyU droplets. Fluorescence microscopy revealed strong
nsp12 fluorescence inside the droplets (Figure 5B).
Next, nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 were reconstituted in a 1:1:2 stoichiometry
together with a RNA template-product duplex, which carried fluorescein at the 5’ end

(Hillen et al., 2020). The RdRp/RNA-complex was added to preformed
NSARS-CoV-2/polyU droplets into which the RdRp/RNA-complex was recruited (Figure
5C). High local concentrations of RdRp and NSARS-CoV-2 were reached (Figure S6).
The data suggest that RNA-driven condensation of NSARS-CoV-2 provides a mechanism
for bringing together components of the viral replication machinery (Figure 5D). In
agreement with this proposed mechanism, N protein of SARS-CoV colocalizes
intracellularly with replicase components (Stertz et al., 2007).

DISCUSSION
Our study shows that the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus undergoes
RNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation. Although nucleocapsid assembly can
occur outside of liquid-like compartments, the rate of assembly is increased when the
nucleocapsid protein is concentrated through LLPS (Guseva et al., 2020). In addition,
NSARS-CoV-2 interacts with human ribonucleoproteins (Gordon et al., 2020), which are
found in several LLPS-driven cytosolic protein/RNA granules, indicating that
NSARS-CoV-2 modulates protein/RNA granule formation in order to maximize viral
replication. In agreement with such activity, we showed that NSARS-CoV-2 translocates
to stress granules in stressed cells.
We demonstrate that NSARS-CoV-2 LLPS promotes cooperative association of
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex with RNA. This suggests that SARSCoV-2 uses LLPS-based mechanisms similar to transcription hubs in cellular nuclei
(Boehning et al., 2018; Cramer, 2019) to enable high initiation and elongation rates
during viral transcription. Because the replication machinery of coronaviruses is
membrane-associated (Sola et al., 2015), it will furthermore be interesting to
investigate if the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein M, which binds nucleocapsid protein
(McBride et al., 2014), causes tethering of NSARS-CoV-2/RdRp/RNA-condensates to
host cell membranes.
Taken together the data suggest that inhibition of the RNA-induced phase
separation of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 provides a viable and novel
strategy for the design of therapeutics to treat Covid-19.

Purification of nsp12, nsp7, nsp8 and formation of RdRp complex
SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 was expressed in insect cells and purified as described
previously(Hillen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 were expressed in E.coli
and purified as described previously(Hillen et al., 2020). An RNA scaffold for
RdRp/RNA complex formation was annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of two

Technologies) in annealing buffer (10 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) and
heating to 75 °C, followed by step-wise cooling to 4 °C. For complex formation, 2.45
nmol of purified nsp12 was mixed with a 1.1-fold molar excess of RNA scaffold and
3-fold molar excess of each nsp8 and nsp7. After incubation at room temperature for
10 min, the complex was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex
200 Increase 3.2/300 equilibrated with complex buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4,
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions with a volume of approx.
125 µL (absorbance at 280 nm of 2.7 AU, 10 mm path length) corresponding to a
nucleic acid-rich high-molecular weight population (as judged by absorbance at 260
nm) were pooled and used for subsequent experiments.

Phase diagrams of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated NSARS-CoV-2 at different
concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Invitrogen). Increasing concentrations of polyU (0 - 2 µM) were added
immediately before the experiments, followed by thoroughly pipetting and
measurement of turbidity at 350 nm UV-Vis. Averages turbidity values were derived
from measurements of three independent, freshly prepared samples.
Microscopy
For fluorescence microscopy, proteins were labeled using Alexa-fluor 488TM (green)
or Alexa-fluor 594TM (red) microscale protein labeling kits (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Invitrogen). Small amounts (~0.3 µl) of fluorescently-labeled NSARS-COV-2 were
premixed with unlabeled NSARS-COV-2 and diluted to 50 µM final concentration with
NaPi 20 mM buffer, pH 7.5. PolyU was added to the mixture to reach a final
concentration of 1 µM. 5 µl of the sample were subsequently loaded onto a slide and
covered with a 18 mm coverslip. DIC and fluorescent micrographs were acquired on a
Leica DM6B microscope with a 63× objective (water immersion) and processed using
Fiji software (NIH). For RNA recruitment assays, fluorescently labeled RNA was
premixed with 1 µM polyU and subsequently added to the mixture of fluorescently
labeled/unlabeled NSARS-COV-2. For nsp12/RdRp/RNA recruitment assays, the
fluorescently labeled component (FAM-labeled RNA scaffold, nsp12 or RdRp/RNAcomplex) was premixed with 1 µM polyU, followed by addition to a mixture of
fluorescently labeled/unlabeled NSARS-COV-2.

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
Dynamics of NSARS-CoV-2 molecules in the phase-separated state were investigated by
FRAP analysis. As described above, NSARS-CoV-2 phase separation was induced using
50 µM NSARS-CoV-2 and 1 µM polyU in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (NaPi), pH
7.5. Droplet movement was reduced through addition of 5 % dextran T500
(Pharmacosmos). The sample was spiked with a small amount of Alexa Fluor 488
lysine labeled NSARS-CoV-2, which was photobleached and followed during recovery.
FRAP recordings were done on freshly formed droplets settled down on the glass
slide (early time points; time of recording <15 min) and after one hour of sample
incubation on the glass (late time points).

FRAP experiments were recorded on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope
using a 63x objective (oil immersion) and a 488 argon laser line. A circular region of
~4 µm in diameter was chosen in a region of homogenous fluorescence away from the
droplet boundary and bleached with five iterations of full laser power. Recovery was
imaged at low laser intensity (5%). 100 frames were recorded with one frame per 523
ms. Pictures were analyzed in FIJI software (NIH) and FRAP recovery curves were
calculated using standard methods. Briefly, fluorescence intensities were measured
for prebleaching, bleached and reference ROI in order to calculate the diffusion
coefficient from FRAP curves. The prebleaching ROI was a selected region in the
droplet before bleaching; the bleached ROI corresponded to the bleached area while
the reference ROI corresponded to an area which did not experience bleaching. The
fluorescence intensity measured for each of the described ROIs was corrected by
background substraction: a region where no fluorescence was detected was used to
calculate the background. Thus, the FRAP recovery was calculated as:

𝑭𝑹𝑨𝑷 =

𝑰𝑩𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 − 𝑰𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒈𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅
𝑰𝑨𝒗.𝑷𝒓𝒆𝒃𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈

The value obtained was then corrected by multiplication with the acquisition
bleaching correction factor (ABCF), which was calculated according to:

𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐹 =

𝐼@ABA@ACDA − 𝑰𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒈𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅
𝑰𝑨𝒗. 𝑹𝒆𝒇𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆

Finally, the curves were normalized according to:

𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =

𝐼 (Q) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛. 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
1 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛. 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒

Values were averaged from six recordings for both early and late time points and the
resulting FRAP curves ± standard deviation (std) were fitted for the early time points
to a mono-exponential function:
𝑦 = 𝑎 ∗ (1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑏 ∗ 𝑥)) + 𝑐

For the late time points, a bi-exponential function provided the best fitting:
𝑦 = 𝑎 ∗ _1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑏 ∗ 𝑥 )` + 𝑦 + 𝑎2 ∗ (1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑏2 ∗ 𝑥)) + 𝑐
In both equations, b/b2 were used to calculate the half time (𝜏c ) of recovery. The
d

obtained value was then used to calculate the diffusion coefficient according to the
equation:
𝐷 = 0.22 ∗

𝑟g
𝜏h
g

where 𝑟 is the radius of the bleached area.
The mobile and immobile fractions were calculated using the parameters a and
c derived from each fitting, according to the following equations:
𝑀𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑒 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑎 + 𝑐
𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑒 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 1 − 𝑎 − 𝑐
Stress granule co-localization and FRAP
HeLa cells (DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH,
ACC 57) were grown in an incubator at 37 ºC in humidified atmosphere with 5 %
CO2. One day before the stress granule co-localization assay and FRAP
measurements cells were seeded in 96-well CELLviewTM slides (Greiner Bio-One)
with glass bottom suitable for imaging so that on the day of the measurement cells
reached ~50% of confluence. Cell membranes were permeabilized by incubation in
cell permeabilization buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 120 mM KOAc, 5 mM
Mg(OAc)2, 250 mM sucrose) supplemented with 60 µg/ml digitonin for 40 s. After
washing cells four times with 100 µL of cell permeabilization buffer live recording
was started on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope using a 63x objective (oil
immersion) and 488 argon laser or 561 laser lines. A mixture of 0.5 µm Alexa Fluor
488 lysine labeled NSARS-CoV-2 and 1:100 Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated G3BP1 antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-365338 AF594) in cell permeabilization buffer was
added to the cells and movies were recorded with 512 x 512 pixel resolution at 1000
Hz speed and 1 s per frame for about 2-3 minutes. For FRAP measurements,
individual stress granules were marked and photobleached with five iterations of full
488 argon laser power. Recovery was imaged at low laser intensity (8 %). 200 frames
were recorded with one frame per 523 ms. Pictures were analyzed in FIJI software

(NIH) and FRAP recovery curves ± standard deviation were calculated and fitted
using bi-exponential fit as described above. Non-bleached stress granules were used
as reference for calculations.
In vitro phosphorylation
Phosphorylation of a stock of 850 µM SR-peptide (1766.8 Da) was performed by
incubation with 0.15 µM SRPK1 kinase at 23 °C overnight in a buffer containing 4
mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 5 mM EGTA. Because of the intrinsically
disordered nature of the peptide, inactivation of the kinase was achieved by
incubation of the sample at 65 °C for 20 minutes, followed by centrifugation at
15,000 g for 30 minutes. Residual ATP, MgCl2 and EGTA were removed by HPLC
followed by mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation of 100 µM unlabeled NSARS-COV-2
was performed by incubation with 0.5 µM of SRPK1 kinase. The reaction mixture
was incubated at 23 °C overnight in a buffer containing 8 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1
mM DTT and 5 mM of EGTA. Residual ATP, MgCl2 and EGTA were removed by 4
times buffer exchange using a Vivaspin 500.5 molecular weight cut-off (Sartorius,
Göttingen). Samples were loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel to confirm phosphorylation.
Mutation frequency analysis
To examine the mutation frequency in SARS-CoV-2 sequences we used the database
and resources from the China National Center for Bioinformation, 2019 Novel
Coronavirus Resource (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov?lang=en; downloaded June 7,
2020, with 42,176 genome sequences). The mutations between the genome positions
28274 and 29530 were analyzed to get the mutation frequency for each codon.

TOCSY, NOESY and

H-15N/1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence

(HSQC) experiments of the SR-peptide (residues A182-S197) of NSARS-CoV-2 were
acquired at 5 °C on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance
5 mm cryogenic probe. The peptide concentration was 4 mM for resonance
assignment and 200 µM for the interaction analysis with polyU (800 kDa). Samples
were in 50 mM NaP, 0.01 % NaN3 and 5 % D2O. Spectra were processed with
TopSpin 3.6 (Bruker) and analyzed using Sparky (Lee et al., 2015). Secondary

structure was analyzed subjecting experimental HA, HN, N, CA and CB chemical
shifts to TALOS+ (Shen et al., 2009). The chemical shift perturbation (CSP) for the
peptide residues is the one of the NH protons from the TOCSY experiment. The CSP
error is based on the resolution of the spectra.
Molecular dynamics simulations
Starting structures of the SR-peptides were built in the PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System (Version 1.8.4.0, Schrödinger, LLC), those of the RNA molecules using the
RNA modelling software SimRNA (Magnus et al., 2016). Initially, the different
mixtures were equilibrated with 50,000 steps of energy minimization. To further
equilibrate the system, 100 ps each of volume (NVT) and pressure (NPT)
equilibration were performed without position restrains in order to have different
starting points in each simulation. The MD simulations were carried out in
GROMACS (version 2018.3) using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field and the
TIP3P water model at a temperature of 300 K, 1 bar of pressure and with a coupling
time (ζT) of 0.1 ps. The mixtures were solvated in water with 150 mM NaCl, ensuring
overall charge neutrality. The particle mesh Ewald algorithm was used for calculation
of the electrostatic term, with a radius of 16 Å for the grid-spacing and Fast Fourier
Transform. The cut-off algorithm was applied for the non-coulombic potential with a
radius of 10 Å. The LINCS algorithm was used to contain bonds and angles. MD
simulations were performed during 1 ns in 2 fs steps and saving the coordinates of the
system every 10 ps. The force field parameters for the phosphorylated amino acids
were taken from (Craft and Legge, 2005). The number of contacts and secondary
structure over the simulation trajectory were analyzed using the PyMOL Molecular
Graphics System (Version 1.8.4.0, Schrödinger, LLC). To get error bars, 5 repetitions
were done for each simulation.
