Abstract
The clinical outcome of COVID-19 has an extreme age, genetic and comorbidity bias that is
thought to be driven by an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of
the disease. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple
studies generating a variety of large gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of
time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we
carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature.
Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those
from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host
functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung
biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical
samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the host’s immune
response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients’ age are
linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical
immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses.
In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that
signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In
particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle
mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age
of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our meta-analysis highlights the
ability of transcriptomics and gene-module analysis of aggregated datasets to aid our improved
understanding of the host-specific disease mechanisms underpinning COVID-19.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2), a new coronavirus phylogenetically related to two other coronaviruses
that emerged in the last 20 years: SARS-CoV (referred to as SARS-CoV-1 here for clarity) and
MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV-1,
utilises ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II) for cellular entry using its spike (S) protein
(Zhou et al. 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein contains a polybasic cleavage site and is
estimated to bind ACE2 with 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV-1 spike, contributing to
infection success, particularly in the upper respiratory tract, by making cells with lower ACE2
expression levels more accessible (Wrapp et al. 2020). Globally, as of December 2020, SARSCoV-2 has caused over 1.7M recorded deaths. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals
are asymptomatic or display relatively mild symptoms including fever, cough and temporary
anosmia (loss of the sense of smell). More severe cases can include symptoms associated with
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), circulatory and heart problems, organ failure and
death (Huang et al. 2020).

The severity of COVID-19 is highly correlated with age and certain comorbidities (Pinto et al.
2020) and has been associated with immune defects (Pairo-Castineira et al. 2020). Virulent
SARS-CoV-2 infections are associated with a dysfunctional immune response and “cytokine
storm” is a particular marker of disease severity. For example, transcriptomics of BALF
(bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) and PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) demonstrated
extensive upregulation of cytokines in COVID-19 patients (Xiong et al. 2020). Moreover, it has
been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro triggers cGAS-STING mediated NF- B
response and a pro-inflammatory cytokine response (Neufeldt et al. 2020). Type I interferons
(IFN) likely play a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis as genetic mutations in the IFN
system and autoantibodies to type I IFNs predispose individuals to severe COVID-19 disease
(Bastard et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2020). Understanding the immune and inflammatory
responses to SARS-CoV-2 is, thus, crucial to deciphering the mechanisms of viral
pathogenesis.
Here we carry out a detailed meta-analysis of available SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomics (RNASeq) datasets and focus on the relationships among groups of differentially expressed genes in
order to enable comparison between distinct studies. Transcriptomics of virus-infected cells can
help us to understand how genes are regulated under specific biological conditions in the
context of viral infection. ‘Gene sets’ are groups of genes that are co-expressed as they
contribute to a shared biological function, for example, a signaling pathway up-regulated by
virus infection. Gene sets associated with specific conditions, in this case viral infection, are
usually derived from multiple studies and their activity under different conditions provides a way
to extract biological relationships from large disparate transcriptomics datasets. Gene set tests
enable us to analyze groups of genes that represent biological functions as a group rather than
individual differentially expressed genes. Gene sets therefore are particularly helpful in metaanalysis of transcriptomics data from different sources. Competitive gene set testing methods
such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al. 2005) evaluate the statistical
significance of enrichment by determining whether a set of genes are correlated to the diseased
state compared to genes in other gene sets, while self-contained methods such as ROAST (Wu
et al. 2010) evaluate whether any genes within a gene set are differentially expressed, allowing
testing for co-regulated genes.
In order to investigate transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients
and to compare transcriptional signatures elicited by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, we use a
well-refined gene set established as ‘blood transcriptome modules’ (BTMs), defined by Li and
co-workers using large scale network integration of public data and context specific biological
information (Li et al. 2014). While biological pathway based analysis focuses primarily on chains
of interacting molecules perturbed in complex diseases such as cancer, BTMs provide high
resolution gene modules that better represent the groups of molecules activated by host
immunological responses (Li et al. 2016). Modules in BTMs are derived by gene co-expression
patterns, supported by experimental information derived from various tissues, cell-types,
interactome studies and molecular pathway information. As with canonical pathways, BTMs can
be applied to transcriptomics datasets derived from various tissues and cell lines in order to
better understand host responses triggered by infection. Higher classification of these functional
modules into groups (Kazmin et al. 2017) based on the pathways or the cell lineages can be
used to systematically capture altering responses to examine the differences in modules that
have a common biological function or regulation. We also use the biological pathway software

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to compare signaling pathways among the various data sets.
To identify the co-expressed networks of genes associated with viral load and different age
groups in a large dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Lieberman et al. 2020), we apply
the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), a well-developed co-expression
method. By correlating groups of genes with BTMs, we assess the functional role of these
networks in infected individuals and provide systems-level evidence of the networks that
contribute to the pathology of the disease in different age groups.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 elicits signatures of adaptive immune pathways in cell lines. In order to
assess the genes associated with the transcriptional dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2 in
infected cell lines, we compared differential module enrichment profiles to the available SARSCoV-1 and MERS-CoV time-matched cell line data. We find SARS-CoV-2 has a distinct module
enrichment profile compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in the different cell lines
analysed, confirming previous analysis (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020). In Calu-3 cells, SARS-CoV-2
exhibits a profound upregulation of all essential B-cell modules (M47.4, M47.3, M54, M9, M58)
at 24 hours post infection relative to SARS-CoV-1, while MERS-CoV elicits a complementary Bcell response in Calu-3 cell lines (figure 1), similar to B-cell module enrichment by SARS-CoV-1
and MERS-CoV in MRC5 cell lines.

Figure 2. Heatmap of -log10(p-values) of the differentially enriched modules of PBMC, BALF and lung
biopsy samples. High level annotation of each module (row) is represented by the classification assigned
by Kazmin et al. (2017) based on pathways or cell lineage each module represents. Direction of
enrichment of the modules are shown in supplementary figure 1.

Interestingly, while MERS-CoV exhibits a ‘strong’ upregulation of T-cell modules in Calu-3 and
MRC5 cell lines at 24 hours post infection, both the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 demonstrate a weak Tcell response signature in both cell lines, indicating a failure of the SARS viruses to trigger
genes associated with adaptive immune/innate T cell responses. ACE2 transduced A549 cells
and ACE2 transduced Ruxolitinib treated A549 cells show a strong enrichment of T-cell
modules, while A549 and NHBE cells lacked significant enrichment of these modules. Both
SARS-CoV-1 and 2 elicit a significant upregulation of the TLR (Toll-like receptors) and
inflammatory signaling module (M16) in Calu-3 cells -- important in identifying different
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for the regulation of host innate immune
response -- while MERS-CoV lacks a representation of this module consistent with MERS-CoV
silencing the TLR response upon infection (Liang et al. 2020). All three betacoronavirus types
exhibit evidence of a strong chemokine response (M27.1 and M27.0) in Calu-3 cells suggesting
the activation of various cytokines to guide immune cell migration to the infection sites to elicit
an active inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 is thus inducing a distinct transcriptional profile
to both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in infected cell lines.
Regulation of distinct functional modules exhibited by different clinical samples. A
heatmap of the enrichment scores (negative log of p-values) of all dysregulated modules (figure
2) indicates that different clinical samples (Table 1 and supplementary table 1) from COVID-19
patients display distinct transcriptional responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. BTMs were
categorized into groups by Kazmin et al. (2017) based on the common pathways or the cell
lineages the genes represent. Analysis of these individual groups of the enriched modules show
that, analogous to the severity of the disease, gene transcripts corresponding to the upregulation of antigen presenting modules and dendritic cell activation modules, which are known
to trigger strong innate immune response against respiratory infections, are upregulated in lung
biopsy samples, while there is a profound down-regulation, or no significant regulation of these
modules, in BALF samples (figure 3). Strikingly, there is an inverse correlation in the regulation
status between PBMC and BALF samples in cell cycle related modules and no representation of
these modules in lung biopsy samples. This is consistent with coronaviruses perturbing cell
cycle mechanisms to evade detection by the host immune system in order to facilitate viral
replication (Dove et al. 2006).

To assess for transcriptional differences associated with age, we grouped 430 SARS-CoV-2
positive and 54 negative, samples, i.e., infected or uninfected, from the surveillance study
(referred to here as surveillance data) of Lieberman et al. (2020) into groupings reflecting the
viral load and age as follows: low (≤30, 31-60 and >60), med (≤30, 31-60 and >60), high (≤30,
31-60 and >60). Nasopharyngeal samples of the older infected individuals compared to the agematched negative controls (samples from the uninfected individuals) exhibited a strong
downregulation of cell cycle related modules in samples with either medium or low viral load
(possibly relating to the later stages of infection) showing host physiology modification by the
virus. Antigen-presenting dendritic cell (DC) related modules are upregulated in younger adults

with high viral load (figure 4), correlating with the upregulation of dendritic cell activated T-cell
modules (figure 5). Absence of the dysregulation of DC modules in older and younger
individuals with low and medium viral load (figure 4) correlates with downregulation of some of
the T-cell modules in these individuals (figure 5). It is important to note that irrespective of age,
there is a profound downregulation of B-cell modules in all the samples with low viral load, while
a crucial B cell development/activation module (M58) is downregulated only in older patients.
Studies have previously shown that a subset of COVID-19 patients fail to develop long-lasting
antibodies (Tay et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020).

With respect to inflammatory, TLR and chemokine modules, lung samples have a
representation of chemokine clusters (M27.0 and M27.1), demonstrating an inflammatory
response by the host system that’s consistent with other studies (Huang et al. 2020, Zhao 2020,
Mehta et al. 2020) while these modules are weakly enriched in BALF and completely absent in
PBMC samples (figure 1). Heatmaps of log transformed scaled expression of the differentially
regulated member genes of inflammatory, TLR and chemokine modules for Lung biopsy (and
cell line) samples and PBMC-BALF samples are shown in supplementary figure 2 and 3,
respectively. These data suggest that there is a strong upregulation of inflammatory genes in
severely diseased COVID-19 patients.

The Calu-3 cell line closely resembles the host transcriptional response. It is important to
identify cell lines that resemble the host response upon infection. Visualization of log
transformed scaled expression of some of the differentially expressed genes of the lung biopsy
samples of COVID-19 patients and cell lines infected by SARS-CoV-2 (supplementary figure 2)
demonstrates that Calu-3, an epithelial human lung cancer cell line, more accurately resembles
the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection than other cell lines such as A549 and
NHBE (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020). Comparison of the enriched modules of various cell lines and
clinical samples show that Calu-3 closely mirrors the host transcriptional response, i.e., similar
to the clinical samples (figure 6) indicating this cell line’s greater suitability for SARS-CoV-2
experimental studies.
Delayed/altered immune response of COVID-19 patients. Differences in the transcriptional
immune response of SARS-CoV-2 patient derived samples provide insights into how the virus
evades host immune responses. Comparison of the significantly enriched modules of the
interferon and antiviral signaling group indicate that there is a lack of type I interferon response
(M127) in PBMC samples as previously reported (Hadjadj et al. 2020) and also in BALF
samples. Lung samples (and cell lines infected in vitro with any of three coronaviruses analysed
here) have a profound representation of this module (figure 7) and other modules (M111.1,
M111.0, M150, M13, M75) of this group demonstrating a strong interferon response in patients
with severe disease and infected cell lines. Visualization of the scaled expression of the
differentially expressed member genes of type I interferon response module of SARS-CoV-2
samples (supplementary figure 4) demonstrate that except for TAP1 gene (transporter
associated with antigen processing 1, the gene-product of which is associated with antigen
presentation by MHC class I), all of the member genes are strongly upregulated in lung biopsy
samples. Several viruses are known to evade immune system detection by expressing proteins
that have a direct effect on the expression of TAP1, hampering detection of infected cells
(Zeidler et al. 1997). Strikingly, irrespective of viral load, younger individuals (<=30 group) have
upregulated enrichment of type I interferon response (M127) module upon SARS-CoV-2
infection (figure 8), while the other groups (31-60 and >60 with medium and high viral load, 3160 with low viral load) lack differential enrichment of this module, demonstrating altered immune
response of these older individuals.
Silencing of RIG-I pathway by SARS-CoV-2 to evade detection by the host immune
system. RIG-I-like receptor signaling (M68) module includes genes that influence antiviral
immunity by playing a key role in pathogen sensing. These pathways are not enriched in any of
the SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (or infected cell lines) (figure 7). In addition, in lung biopsy
samples, interferon alpha response I module (M158.0 -- genes unique to this module are
COL8A1, FGF5, IMPG2, ITGB4, LAMC2, MMP12, SFN, ST14, TNR) is downregulated while
interferon alpha response II module (M158.1 -- genes unique to this module are FAM123A,
IFNA2, IFNA21, IFNA5, IFNA8, PRL) is upregulated. Irrespective of the viral load (low, med,
high) and the age groups (<=30, 31-60 and >60), none of the samples in the surveillance data
(see supplementary table 1) have M68, M158.0 or M158.1 modules enriched, demonstrating
lack of interferon alpha response and inactivation/silencing of RIG-I-like receptor signaling in

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are expressed in various tissues
and coordinate the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) (Loo et al. 2011) upon infection and act
as the first line of defense against viral pathogens. TRIM25, an IFN inducible gene is known to
mediate ubiquitylation of RIG-I (also known as DDX58), forming a complex that promotes
interferon induction (Liu et al. 2016; Ozato et al. 2008; Gack et al. 2007). Visualization of the log
transformed fold changes of the member genes of M158.0, M158.1 and M68 modules along
with ZAP (also known as ZC3HAV1) (supplementary figure 5) in all SARS-CoV-2 samples
shows that as a consequence of infection there is a profound upregulation of interferon alpha
genes, no change in the expression of TRIM25, and a striking downregulation of SFN (also
known as stratifin, 14-3-3ε) in the lung biopsy samples. SFN belonging to M158.0 (interferon
alpha response I module) is known to be a binding factor of RIG-I and is essential for the stable
interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I, promoting ubiquitylation and thereby facilitating
interferon induction (Liu et al. 2012).

Ingenuity pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes confirms there is a distinct
immune pathway regulation profile for each of the SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples (supplementary
figure 6) and no enrichment of the RIG-I signaling pathway in any of them. Viruses have evolved
to develop refined mechanisms to counteract host immune responses. Many viruses are known
to suppress host interferon response by antagonizing RIG-I signaling pathways, by manipulating
the signaling cascades that led to suppression of type I interferons (Liu et al. 2016) and it is
known SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV downregulates RIG-I ubiquitylation through their viral
deubiquitinating enzymes (Liu et al. 2016).
Gene co-expression analysis by WGCNA. To elucidate transcriptional response of the host in
an unbiased way, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA, see methods) was
used to construct co-expression networks focussing on the correlated gene expression of the
batch corrected surveillance data from Lieberman et al. (2020). WGCNA extracts modules of
interest by identifying correlation-based interaction between genes and associates module
‘eigengenes’ with meta-data information such as gender and viral load, where an eigengene is a
representative summary of the expression profile of each module from the first principal
component of the standardized expression profile. WGCNA was separately applied to groups of
samples belonging to the same age groups and infection status (Table 2).

Co-expression analyses identified three modules in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals aged
<=30, interestingly none of the modules are correlated with viral load or gender demonstrating a
relatively controlled host immune response triggered by the virus in younger individuals (figure
9, functional annotation of modules by GSEA explained later in this paragraph). While eight
modules are identified in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals aged between 31-60, two of which
are strongly positively correlated with high viral load and are strongly negatively correlated with
low viral load (figure 9), three modules, in which two are positively correlated with high viral load
and negatively correlated with low viral load are identified in infected individuals aged >60. Note,
information about the infection status and age group is incorporated into the names of each
module in order to avoid similarly named modules across sample groups. Gene set enrichment
analysis with BTMs as reference modules performed with GeneOverlap package in R was used
to identify the functional role of each identified module in all the groups. Within each age group,
multiple assignments to the same reference module are aggregated by taking the maximum
negative log of p-value from GeneOverlap package and significant enrichments grouped by their
annotations are shown in figure 10.
Among all age groups (<=30, 31-60 and >60), relative to their negative counterparts, older
individuals (>60) have the strongest host response upon infection, i.e., highest levels of
perturbation/inflammation - strong up-regulation or down-regulation of the enriched modules.
Cell cycle related modules in older SARS-CoV-2 (>60) infected individuals with lower viral load
are disrupted (figure 9), possibly due to the cell cycle arrest mechanisms, which coronaviruses
are known to activate for promoting viral replication (Dove et al. 2006). Another striking class of
modules hyper-enriched in the older individuals (>60) are the monocyte related modules (figure
10) that contribute both to the innate and adaptive immunity of the host. We speculate that this
enrichment, again possibly associated with the aging process, could be contributing to the
dysregulated immune response in older patients. Due to the lack of recorded disease
characteristics for these surveillance samples (Lieberman et al. 2020), we are unable to further
associate the enrichment of these pathways with disease outcomes.

As expected, inflammatory, TLR and chemokine related modules are hyper-enriched in older
patients (>60) in comparison to the samples from the 31-60 age group. Interestingly some of the
modules are strongly enriched even in the negative older individuals (>60), possibly correlated
to aging or underlying disease responses. It will be interesting to analyse how the enrichment of
these modules accounts for the clinical characteristics of the disease and association with
comorbidities.

Performing enrichment analysis with tmod (see methods) confirms most of the enriched
modules are consistent in the age groups 31-60 and >60. Discordant modules between these
groups include antigen presentation and dendritic cell related modules, leading to differential
enrichment of T cell activation and immune activation related modules. In line with the results of
WGCNA analysis, tmod analysis shows that the cell cycle and transcription related modules are
in discordance between the age groups 31-60 and >60. Type I interferon response and other
antiviral response modules are concordant among the three groups, while some of the samples
in the 31-60 group have these modules differentially enriched in comparison to the <=30 group
and >60 groups (figure 11). These observations highlight the importance of age as a
determining factor of altering viral inducible immune activation pathway mechanisms that lead to
immune dysregulation in infected older individuals.
Decrease in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity

To characterize immune response differences between age groups based on the viral load, we
extracted differential expression information of the member genes of identified WGCNA
modules from the results of limma-voom workflow (see materials and methods section) and
used IPA to identify dysregulated pathways and their activation statuses. IPA infers activation
status of pathways by calculating z-scores based on the differential regulation of genes and the
direction of the effect associated with edges of experimentally observed molecular networks.
Irrespective of the viral load, infected individuals in the age groups 31-60 and >60 have a

phosphorylation (OxPhos), a functional unit of mitochondria plays an important role in ATP
(adenosine 5 -triphosphate) synthesis and apoptosis; any reduction in OxPhos activity leads to
dysregulated mitochondrial ROS (reactive oxygen species) signaling, reduced cellular ATP and
trigger ROS-mediated cell damages (Fekete et al. 2018; Yoshizumi et al. 2017). Recovery of
OxPhos activity re-establishes RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) mediated signal transduction
counteracting impaired induction of interferons in viral infected cells (Yoshizumi et al. 2017),
indicating OxPhos activity could be an important requirement for RLR-mediated signaling
transduction. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses RIG-I mediated antiviral innate
immunity by impairing oxidative phosphorylation activity of the host.
Discussion
The severity of COVID-19 is due to differences in host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 that
are strongly associated with genetic factors, age and specific comorbidities. Understanding
mechanistically how SARS-CoV-2 perturbs and evades the immune system provides much
needed insights into viral escape mechanisms, immunopathology and directions for the
development of novel therapeutics. In this study, we use a meta-analysis approach to compare
enriched gene sets/functional modules in transcriptomics datasets, combined with a network
approach, to identify distinct transcriptional profile signatures exhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infected
patient samples and cell lines (figure 13). We used a well-defined functional blood
transcriptomics module set that integrates data obtained from more than 500 transcriptomics
studies and various sources (Li et al. 2014). These modules have more discriminative power in
identifying context-specific gene modules than results arising from individual experiments, and
are being increasingly used as a data-rich context in transcriptomics studies. We also used
Ingenuity pathway analysis software to identify pathways that are dysregulated upon SARSCoV-2 infection in patient and cell line samples.
Contrary to expectation, our comparison of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines and patient derived
samples collected with published SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV datasets, showed that host
responses to SARS-CoV-2 are less similar to those against SARS-CoV-1 than the latter are to
responses to MERS-CoV (figure 13). SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV elicit differential regulation
of genes responsible for important immune functions such as adaptive immunity, cell cycle
damage, inflammation and innate immunity, while in COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2
infected cell lines, some of these crucial signaling pathways are being repressed (Blanco-Melo
et al. 2020).

Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immunity by not triggering RIG-I signaling
pathway, thereby delaying the type-I interferon response. The RIG-I signaling pathway is known
to be interfered with by the nucleocapsid protein in both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, through
interaction of N protein with TRIM25 thereby inhibiting TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination
and suppressing type I IFN production (Hu et al. 2017). In SARS-CoV-1, increased infection
dose has been shown to enhance suppression of RIG-I signaling (Hu et al. 2017) and delayed
ISG expression combined with immune dysregulation has been shown (Channappanavar et al.

2016) to be a contributor to disease severity in mice, indicating the role of innate immunity in
control of infection and how in older individuals can lead to severe disease. Unlike SARS-CoV1, avoidance/delaying of type-I interferon response in SARS-CoV-2 infection is probably linked
to CpG depletion and ZAP-TRIM25 evasion (Li et al. 2017). Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP,
also known as ZC3HAV1) acts against RNA viruses by detecting viral RNAs that have a higher
CpG dinucleotide frequencies than the host mRNAs. TRIM25 interacts with ZAP through its
SPRY domain and enhances its ability to inhibit translation of the viral genomes. The shorter
isoform of ZAP, ZAPS associates with RIG-I and functions as a stimulator of interferon
responses during viral infections (Hayakawa et al. 2011). Detection of the viral genes by ZAP,
which in turn depends on the CpG frequencies of the viral mRNA, is crucial for the activation of
RIG-I signaling pathway and induction of interferon alpha responses. We are unable to
determine from the available data if the avoidance of RIG-I signaling is a determinant of disease
severity in COVID-19 patients. Possibly the infection dose accounts for severity of illness:
older/co-morbid patients having their interferon alpha pathway evaded for longer due to
(relatively) lower virus dose, with younger-severe cases due to a higher dose-effect. A recent
study has demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of SARS-CoV-2 blocks RIG-I
dependent immune responses (Thoms et al. 2020), while another showed that ZAP restricts
SARS-CoV-2 and its knock down in Calu-3 cells enhanced viral replication particularly upon
treatment with IFN-α or IFN-γ (Nchioua et al. 2020).
The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I has been tested by pretreating Vero E6 cells with
IFN-α (Lokugamage et al. 2020) resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication and
reduced nucleocapsid protein production of SARS-CoV-2, while SARS-CoV-1 robustly
expressed viral proteins in IFN-α treated cells after 48 hours. This sensitivity to interferon
indicates immunotherapy that activates the RIG-I pathway may lead to restoration of early type I
interferon response in patients, counteracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent PRRs (pattern
recognition receptor) stimulating study demonstrates the pathophysiological role of type III
interferons in COVID-19 patients (Broggi et al. 2020). Collectively these results indicate
immunopathology due to SARS-CoV-2 infection predominant in older people is driven by
immune dysregulation, i.e., an inability to control disease. Regulation of interferon alpha
response despite being a moderator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells will probably not work in
older people due to immune dysregulation. A recent retrospective study shows administration of
IFN in later stages of the disease to be associated with increased mortality and delayed
recovery in COVID-19 patients (Wang et al. 2020), suggesting the timing of the therapy to be
crucial for favorable clinical outcomes. Another interesting study compared type I interferon
response in mild vs severe patients using single-cell transcriptomics data to determine its role in
aggravating inflammation in COVID-19 patients (Lee et al. 2020).
What has become clear is pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals depends on many
factors such as sex, age, genetics etc., with increasing age the most important determinant of
the disease outcome in COVID-19 patients, with those 80 years or older having more than 20fold risk of death than those aged between 50 to 59 (Williamson et al. 2020). Age-related
changes in the host innate immune system such as declining activities of monocytes,
macrophages and dendritic cells weaken the ability to respond to infections or gain protective
immunity from vaccination and this immunosenescence impacts the adaptive immune response
of the host (Panda et al. 2009). During inflammation or infection, monocytes are recruited
through blood circulation, differentiate into antigen presenting cells and are then involved in

resolving inflammation (Kratofil et al. 2017). Reduced expression of certain chemokine
receptors like CX3CR1 due to aging, affects the ability of monocytes to migrate to the
inflammatory sites to clear up inflammation and thus increased number of monocytes in older
individuals is not necessarily positively correlated with increased functionality (Seidler et al.
2010). Our results demonstrate that the hyper-enrichment of monocyte related modules not only
in SARS-CoV-2 infected older individuals but also in older negative controls may play an
important role in immunopathology in the older individuals, possibly correlating with clinical
outcomes (Pence 2020). A recent study (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al. 2020) observed a
sudden decrease in monocyte expression preceding respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is enriched in the host mitochondria and nucleolus and this
localization is predicted to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, likely to increase viral replication
without being detected by the host immune system (Singh et al. 2020). ORF9b of SARS-CoV-1
is known to influence innate immunity by localizing into host mitochondria and promoting viral
replication (Shi et al. 2014). Several viruses are known to modulate mitochondria-mediated
antiviral immunity and possess strategies either to hijack host mitochondrial proteins or to mimic
them (Anand and Tikoo 2013). In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals
irrespective of age have their mitochondrial mechanisms altered by the virus leading to
mitochondrial dysfunction. As oxidative phosphorylation generates energy important for viral
replication, selective regulation of this activity by the viruses results in sustained viral replication
(Cao et al. 2017) during host shutoff induced by viral infections. Early after infection, hepatitis C
virus limits oxidative phosphorylation activity to efficiently allow for viral replication (Gerresheim
et al. 2019) and several other viruses suppress immune responses by reprogramming OxPhos
activity and other mitochondrial functions (Moreno-Altamirano et al. 2019), thereby manipulating
type I interferon response of the host. RIG-I mediated antiviral responses are known to rely on
oxidative phosphorylation activity to produce type I interferons (Yoshizumi et al. 2017; Fekete et
al. 2018); mitochondrial DNA deficiency with abnormal OxPhos activity results in impairment of
RLR-mediated antiviral signaling enhancing susceptibility of the host to viral infection
(Yoshizumi et al. 2017). SARS-CoV-2 seems to down-regulate OxPhos activity that is crucial for
early detection of the virus by the host innate immune system mechanisms, thus accelerating
viral replication inside the host.
In conclusion, meta analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic data sets coupled with gene set and
network analysis had revealed that the virus establishes infection by delaying/avoidance of typeI interferon response by suppressing OxPhos dependent RIG-I signaling pathway, possibly by
avoiding TRIM25-ZAP detection by the immune system of the host. Immunosenescence in older
individuals exhibited by negative controls in the surveillance data reveals that the host factors
such as age related immune dysregulation and co-morbidities play a crucial role in determining
severity and outcome of the disease. This study demonstrates the ability of focused gene set
and network analyses -- applied to transcriptomics datasets from various sources -- to provide
valuable insights into the disease characteristics of COVID-19.

featureCounts program (Liao et al. 2014) in the Subread R package (Liao et al. 2019). SARSCoV-2 cell line and lung biopsy data (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020; Wyler et al. 2020), SARS-CoV-1
(Josset et al. 2013; Sims et al. 2013; Frieman et al. 2014) and MERS-CoV (Josset et al. 2013;
Frieman et al. 2013) were downloaded from NCBI GEO using the following accession numbers:
GSE147507, GSE45042, GSE33267, GSE56192, GSE148729. Where available, the mapped
read count data was downloaded for each RNA-seq dataset and analysed. If mapped data was
unavailable, the sequencing data was downloaded and processed as described above.
Microarray data of SARS-CoV-1 and the MERS-CoV were processed using the GEOquery
package (Davis and Meltzer 2007), implemented in the R statistical language. Differential
expression and BTM enrichment analysis of all the datasets were performed with limma
workflow (Ritchie et al. 2015), using a design model specifying sample types, time points
wherever applicable, and infection status as covariates. As an additional preprocessing step,
RNA-seq counts were scaled and normalized by the TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) method
of edgeR package (Robinson et al. 2010) and log transformed using voom (Law et al. 2014),
followed by differential expression analysis using the limma workflow.
Genes with an absolute log transformed expression ratio of ≥1, and with a Benjamini and
Hochberg (BH) (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) adjusted p-value of ≤0.01, were considered
differentially expressed. The differential gene lists containing gene identifiers, log transformed
fold change and their corresponding false discovery rates (FDR) were analysed with the
Ingenuity

software
(https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis) and differentially
regulated canonical pathways identified. Gene set testing using downloaded BTMs were
performed using the MROAST package (Wu et al. 2010) with the same design model described
above. For both the IPA and BTM enrichment analysis, p-value correction for multiple testing
was using the BH method; those with an FDR of 5% were considered differentially regulated.
Dysregulated canonical pathways and enriched BTMs were compared across all SARS-CoV-2
datasets, to differentiate host immune response in different samples upon infection, as well as
to elucidate differences between patient samples and cell line responses. By comparing SARSCoV-2 module enrichment with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, differences in the overall
response exhibited by these viruses in cell lines and distinct responses of the SARS-CoV-2
were identified.
Mapped read counts from a transcriptomic dataset of nasopharyngeal swabs comprising 430
SARS-CoV-2 positive and 54 negative samples (Lieberman et al. 2020), downloaded from NCBI
GEO using the accession number GSE152075, were analyzed to understand the differences
associated with age and viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We used the
variancePartition package (Hoffman et al. 2016) in R to compute the fraction of variance
explained by known biological and technical covariates such as sequencing batch and gender.
Violin plots demonstrating known sources of variation in the data before and after correction are
depicted in supplementary figure 8, showing the major technical driver of variation to be
sequencing batch and biological variation to be viral load. We used the voom function in the
limma R package to correct for batch and gender and retained the effect of viral load to stratify
data.
Co-expression networks were constructed using the weighted gene correlation network analysis
(Langfelder et al. 2008) in R. Based on the hierarchical clustering of the normalized expression

of the genes, correlated networks of genes were identified among different age groups using a
dynamic cuttree algorithm. The minimum module size was set to 50 and correlation of module
eigengenes with viral load computed using pearson correlation analysis. To determine the
functional roles of the constructed WGCNA modules, the Fisher exact test was used,
implemented in the GeneOverlap package (Shen 2020), using BTMs as reference modules and
enriched modules across age groups were compared. Concordance and discordance of module
enrichment across age groups were determined by calculating the disco.score of the differential
co-expressed member genes of WGCNA modules using the disco package (Domaszewska et
al. 2017) in R. For each gene-pair, the degree of change in gene expression (log-fold change),
statistical significance of the differential expression (p-values) and direction of differential
expression are used to calculate the disco.score. Gene set enrichment analysis on decreasing
and increasing ordered lists of genes based on the disco.score were used to identify concordant
and discordant modules, respectively, across each pairwise age groups using the tmod package
(Weiner et al. 2016) in R against the reference modules.
