Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 mutations with antigenic effects pose a risk to immunity developed through
vaccination and natural infection. While vaccine updates for current variants of concern
(VOCs) are underway, it is likewise important to prepare for further antigenic mutations
as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this
end, a wealth of data and tools exist that can augment existing genetic surveillance of
VOC evolution. In this study, we integrate published datasets describing genetic,
structural, and functional constraints on mutation along with computational analyses of
antibody-spike co-crystal structures to identify a set of potential antigenic drift sites
(PADS) within the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARSCoV-2 spike protein. Further, we project the PADS set into a continuous epitope-paratope
space to facilitate interpretation of the degree to which newly observed mutations might
be antigenically synergistic with existing VOC mutations, and this representation suggests
that functionally convergent and synergistic antigenic mutations are accruing across VOC
NTDs. The PADS set and synergy visualization serve as a reference as new mutations
are detected on VOCs, enable proactive investigation of potentially synergistic mutations,
and offer guidance to antibody and vaccine design efforts.

Introduction
While an unprecedented sequencing effort to track SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2)
evolution is underway, current surveillance efforts could be enhanced by additional
experimental and computational tools. The identification of variants of concern (VOC) that
are more transmissible [Davies et al., 2021], virulent [Challen et al., 2021], and partially
resistant to antibodies [Wang et al., 2021] and immunity acquired through convalescence
[Sabino et al., 2021] and vaccination [Madhi et al., 2021] emphasizes the critical need for
surveillance. Though the VOC identified so far appear unlikely to severely infect
convalescent individuals or to significantly jeopardize the current rollout of highly-effective
vaccines [Abdool Karim et al., 2021], observation of convergent evolution of antigenic
mutations on these VOC in combination with studies of seasonal coronaviruses [Eguia et
al., 2021; Kistler et al., 2021] suggests that mutations will accumulate across the spike
protein in response to selection pressure from host immune responses. A similar
phenomenon has been reported in the case of influenza A viruses wherein mutations to
escape host immune response are assimilated as the virus transmits between individuals
who are antigenically naive and those who have been exposed via infection or vaccination
[Cobey et al., 2017]. SARS-CoV-2 presents a unique opportunity to study mutations that
could lead to antigenic drift over a much shorter timeframe than what is typically observed
for influenza, which has been circulating in humans for decades. Although the currently
observed VOCs might not represent true drift mutations that cause a substantial portion
of people with exposure to the original antigen (through infection or vaccination) to
become reinfected and have severe disease [Abu-Raddad et al., 2021], they do represent
mutational paths for evolution of antigenic drift. Therefore, there is a need to develop tools
to understand and potentially predict the evolving landscape of antigenic mutations in the
receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein towards
guiding vaccine development efforts and public health responses.
The RBD and NTD present numerous antibody epitopes that are highly
overlapping and variably engaged, and it would be beneficial to derive a continuous
description of “epitope-paratope space” at these domains to enhance our understanding
of the key antigenic residues and the relationships between them. RBD epitopes have
thus far been described using a variety of approaches, including the classification of

antibodies targeting the RBD into four major “classes” based on structural analysis
[Barnes et al., 2020]. This discrete description has proven useful for understanding key
VOC mutations: the E484K mutation was associated with escape from class 2 antibodies
while mutations at K417 were associated with escape from class 1 antibodies [Greaney
et al., 2021b]. However, discrete descriptions do not convey heterogeneity within nor
overlap between epitopes/mAb classes. For example, it is not clear to what extent there
remains class 1 and 2 antibody pressure on VOCs bearing the E484K and K417N/T
mutations, especially from antibodies that do not fit neatly into these classes or that
partially overlap with another class. Similarly, it is difficult to ascertain the degree to which
emerging mutations that provide escape from a specific group of antibodies such as
L452R (which escapes binding of certain antibodies in class 3 but also has a slight effect
on certain class 2 antibodies [Greaney et al., 2021b]), might provide synergistic escape
with VOCs bearing E484K (class 2 escape). Therefore, there is a need for alternative
continuous descriptions of RBD epitope-paratope space—as well as extension to NTD
given the dominant role NTD Abs can play for some individuals [Voss et al., 2021]—to
better understand and potentially predict the landscape of mutations that are antigenically
synergistic with mutations on current VOCs.
In this study, we sought to map potential antigenic drift sites (PADS) using an
epitope-paratope space representation that illustrates the potential for evolution of
synergistic escape mutations in the RBD and NTD sites. Specifically, we aimed to build
a model of PADS that could be used to understand the potential for newly observed
mutations to provide synergistic escape with mutations on current VOCs, as such
synergistic mutations are most likely to reduce the protective margin provided by
convalescence and vaccination. Toward this end, we (1) performed a computational
analysis of co-crystal structures of mAbs and nanobodies complexed with RBD and NTD
to map epitope-paratope space at these domains; (2) defined a set of sites on RBD that
are unconstrained to mutate based on genetic, structural, and functional features drawn
from existing experimental datasets [Starr et al., 2020], GISAID [Shu et al., 2017], and
our own structural analysis; (3) defined the set of PADS as those residues that are both
antigenic and unconstrained to mutate; and (4) integrated (1), (2), and (3) to build a model
of PADS in continuous epitope-paratope space that facilitates interpretation of potential

synergistic escape between mutations on RBD and NTD. The resulting set of PADS
provides a reference set of RBD and NTD sites of elevated antigenic drift risk, and the
model of PADS offers a continuous map of RBD/NTD epitope-paratope space. While our
results add immediate value toward understanding why certain mutations appear selected
together (e.g., E484K and K417N/T) while others do not (e.g. E484K and L452R), our
model will provide additional value as mutations accrue on VOCs and the scientific
community seeks to understand the potential antigenic impact of each one. Further, the
continuous epitope-paratope space model can aid proactive surveillance of VOCs, for
example, via assessing whether convalescent, vaccinee, and VOC booster sera
neutralizes pseudoviruses bearing VOC + predicted synergy mutations, as well as serve
as the basis for immune-focusing vaccine design.
Results
Epitope-Paratope Analysis of RBD-mAb Structures Captures Binding Escape from
Convalescent Sera
Toward our first goal of mapping RBD and NTD epitope-paratope space from cocrystal structures, we leveraged and extended a previously validated computational
approach for quantifying protein networks, known as Significant Interaction Networks
(SIN) [Soundararajan et al., 2011]. Briefly, mAb-RBD/NTD co-crystal structures are
converted to network-models, with nodes describing residues and edges describing nonbonded interactions between residues. From the network model of epitope-paratope
complexes, we derive networking scores between all pairs of epitope and paratope
residues. While a direct networking metric has been described and validated previously
for measuring interactions spanning the epitope-paratope interface [Robinson et al.,
2015], we theorized that an indirect networking metric would better capture allosteric
effects critical to assessing the impact of a given epitope mutation on antibody escape
(see Methods). To benchmark our indirect networking metric, we measured the
correlation between indirect networking (computed across mutable RBD residues for 39
RBD-mAb complexes) and a published experimental dataset describing binding escape
from convalescent sera [Greaney et al., 2021a] (Figure S1). We found a strong correlation
(r=0.65, p < 0.01) and observed that indirect networking captured all mutable residues

with elevated sera escape, suggesting that the epitope-paratope analysis utilized in this
study is largely representative of the polyclonal sera response measured in Greaney et
al. 2021a.
RBD and NTD Epitope-Paratope Mapping
Next, we applied SIN to the set of mAb/nanobody-RBD/NTD complexes to produce
networking scores between each mAb/nanobody and every residue on RBD (Figure 1)
and NTD (Figure S2). Direct and indirect networking scores were normalized mAb-wise
and summed to obtain a total networking score between each mAb and each RBD/NTD
residue, and the resulting epitope-paratope networking matrices were clustered epitopewise (RBD/NTD residues) and paratope-wise (mAbs and nanobodies). For RBD, the mAb
clustering (Figure 1, X-axis dendrogram) indicates three “epitopes regions” (ERs) on
RBD, with each ER containing 2-4 overlapping epitopes (labeled A-D for each ER). For
NTD, the mAb clustering indicates a single dominant epitope region that is consistent with
previous descriptions of the NTD “supersite” [Cerruti et al., 2021], as well as a second
under-sampled NTD ER that is so far only structurally-characterized for a single mAb
(DH1052, [Li D et al. 2021]).
The three RBD ERs appear to broadly correspond to the RBD back (ER1), ACE-2
binding site (ER2), and RBD front (ER3). The epitopes within each ER significantly
overlap yet also indicate substantial differences which reflect, among other features:
distinct epitope residues, relative networking strength of key residues, and variations in
mAb/nanobody angle of attack. ER1 broadly describes the SARS-conserved epitope
region on the RBD back that is only accessible in RBD up and further consists of two
overlapping yet distinct epitopes. Interestingly, despite significant overlap, these two
epitopes appear to neutralize via different mechanisms, with antibodies targeting epitope
ER1-A neutralizing via avidity [Liu et al., 2020] and those targeting ER1-B neutralizing via
ACE2 binding interference [Lv et al., 2020]. ER2 describes the immunodominant ACE2binding site and includes both the most mAbs and the most epitopes. Antibodies targeting
these epitopes overwhelmingly bind both RBD up and RBD down and neutralize primarily
via steric obstruction of ACE2 binding. Meanwhile, ER3 describes the relatively poorly

characterized RBD epitopes on the RBD front that are distinct from the ACE2 binding site.
Our map divides ER3 into two sub-epitopes, but the low number of mAbs and high degree
of heterogeneity suggest that this ER remains under-sampled in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB). While this may be largely explained by the fact that mAbs targeting this region
such as COVOX-45 tend to be weak neutralizers [Dejnirattisai et al., 2021], others such
as S309 potently neutralize [Pinto et al., 2020]. The epitope-paratope map highlights how
COVOX-45 and S309 differentially interact with ER3 RBD residues, offering insights into
the ER3 residues enabling potent neutralization for S309.
In contrast to ER3, the high number of structurally-characterized mAbs and
nanobodies in ER2 (ACE2-binding surface) likely results from the selection bias during
mAb isolation and development for the most potent neutralizers, which tend to target the
ACE2 binding site [Jiang et al., 2020]. A similar phenomenon appears to exist for NTD
with all but a single (weakly binding) NTD mAb in PDB targeting the same “supersite” ER.
Still, substantial variation across mAbs targeting RBD ER2 exists allowing identification
of approximately four distinct epitopes within ER2: ER2-A, ER2-B, ER2-C, and ER2-D. In
particular, mAbs targeting ER2-B feature the least amount of epitope-paratope
networking variation likely reflecting evolutionary proximity to the common germline
IGHV3–53 [Huang et al., 2020; Raybould et al., 2020], while the other epitopes within
ER2 feature greater variation. Similar to the S309 and COVOX-45 comparison above, the
epitope-paratope map facilitates straightforward comparison of mAbs targeting similar or
overlapping RBD and NTD epitopes, which can be correlated with experimental readouts
to generate mechanistic hypotheses for differences in affinity, pan-coronavirus breadth,
escape-susceptibility, or other features.
Despite the overrepresentation of mAbs targeting the ACE2 binding site (ER2), the
epitope-paratope map still indicates coverage of mAbs targeting the other two ERs. Thus,
in combination with our observation that indirect networking captures the major RBD
escape mutations observed in Greaney et al. 2021a, we hypothesized that the epitopeparatope map covers the dominant antibody epitopes on RBD and NTD and can serve
as the basis for 1) identifying potential antigenic drift sites (PADS) within these domains,
and 2) defining a continuous representation of epitope-paratope space for estimation of
synergy between PADS.

Figure 1: Computational RBD Epitope-Paratope Mapping from mAb- and NanobodyRBD Complexes. The color of each square represents total networking between a given
mAb paratope (x-axis) and RBD residue (y-axis). To aid visualization, only residues that
score in the top 75% of all residues for at least three of the mAbs or nanobodies are
shown. Equivalent maps for direct and indirect networking in isolation are included in the
supplement (Fig S1-2). Three epitope regions (ERs 1-3) are highlighted as orange, green,
or yellow and are separated by vertical green lines. Two to four epitopes (A-D) are
annotated within each ER and separated by vertical blue lines, reflecting groups of highly
similar mAbs and nanobodies. While certain ERs are highly uniform (ER1-B), others are
highly variable (ER2-C).
Computation of Potential Antigenic Drift Sites (PADS)
After mapping RBD and NTD epitope-paratope interactions, we next sought to
determine the set of PADS before finally projecting the PADS into continuous epitopeparatope space for interpretation of synergistic mutations. We defined PADS as those
mutations which we predict to have 1) weak constraints on mutation, and 2) an
antigenically relevant mutation effect. While a lack of mutational constraints is a
requirement for mutation, our approach is not predicated on nor predictive of any specific
selective pressure such as host immune response or fitness enhancement. Rather, we
sought to identify residues that are not genetically, structurally, or functionally constrained
to mutate. We integrated computational analyses, existing experimental datasets, and log
mutation frequencies in GISAID to estimate genetic, structural, and functional constraints
on RBD site mutation. Note functional mutagenesis datasets are so far not available for
NTD as they are for RBD, and NTD appears tolerant of substantial mutation and deletion
based on the variety of NTD mutations observed on VOC. Consequently, identification of
NTD PADS was based entirely on antigenicity analysis.
For RBD PADS, we first applied a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) filter to
remove all RBD amino acid mutations that are not achievable via a SNP from the
reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1). Next, we applied spectral clustering
(see Methods) to identify higher-dimensional relationships across the computational and
experimental mutability features (Figure S5, Table S1). The set of RBD SNP mutations
was well described by four clusters, one of which (Cluster 0) is dominantly mutable, and

three of which are primarily immutable according to the average characteristics of the
residues in each cluster. We filtered out the constrained mutations belonging to the
primarily immutable clusters, taking the unconstrained mutations belonging to the
dominantly mutable cluster forward to our antigenic analysis. (Figure S5, Cluster 0).
Finally, we sought to identify residues that have the greatest antigenic effect upon
mutation within the set of unconstrained and low-fitness cost mutations. To estimate
antigenic effect, we calculated a single antigenicity score as the weighted sum of three
epitope-paratope interface features (Figure S5, Table S2), where the weights for each
feature are the coefficients of the first principal component of the feature matrix. Two of
these features are previously introduced as direct and indirect networking and describe
the importance of a given residue to epitope-paratope interfaces and within-epitope
structure. To estimate the magnitude of perturbation by mutation to a specific residue, we
added a third feature representing the change in epitope-paratope surface
complementarity (SC) upon mutation (see Methods). Importantly, all three features are
computed using the set of mAb/nanobody-RBD complexes which contains a significant
PDB sampling bias in the number of mAbs per ER, suggesting normalization may be
required to compare the antigenicity of residues from different ERs. On the other hand,
as previously mentioned our analysis suggests this bias is roughly correlated with
neutralization potency due to the large number of structurally characterized mAbs
targeting the ACE2 binding site. However, it is precisely these epitopes that have been
knocked down by VOC mutations such as E484K and K417N/T, and so we believe the
most accurate contemporary depiction of RBD and NTD epitope-paratope space is one
in which these biases are controlled for, such that less immunodominant sites that may
become increasingly relevant on future VOC are highlighted. Therefore, we correct for
the PDB sampling bias by normalizing the antigenicity for each RBD/NTD residue to the
number of mAbs directly or indirectly networked to the given residue. This workflow
generates normalized antigenicity estimates for each of 79 unconstrained RBD
residues—the PADS set. We next interpret the PADS in continuous epitope-paratope
space to build our understanding of potential antigenic drift paths for the SARS-CoV-2
RBD and NTD.

Network Model of PADS in Continuous Epitope Space
Having identified the PADS set, we sought to project the PADS into a continuous
epitope-paratope space that encompasses the direct and indirect networking between
residues in the RBD and NTD and the entire set of mAbs and nanobodies, allowing
identification of key PADS and the relationships between them. Briefly, we converted
each residue in the set of PADS to a node in our network and defined node positions and
edges according to distance between residues in epitope-paratope space. Distances
between pairs of residues in epitope-paratope space are close for residues that bind
highly similar sets of mAbs with similar relative strengths and distant for residues that bind
orthogonal sets of mAbs (see Methods). For an illustrative example, consider residues
E484 and F490. As shown in Figure 1, the set of mAbs that are networked to E484 are
nearly the same set of mAbs networked to F490. Further, E484 and F490 score similarly
high for most of the mAbs they interact with relative to other residues. Therefore,
mutations at F490 are unlikely to provide synergistic escape with mutations at E484 since
mutations at both residues likely affect a highly overlapping set of mAbs, and F490 should
be closely associated with E484 in epitope-paratope space. On the other hand, escape
mutations at residues which bind entirely orthogonal sets of mAbs would be likely to
synergistically knock down binding on VOCs harboring the E484K mutation, and thus will
be distant from one another in the network representation of epitope-paratope space. This
workflow produces a network model of PADS in epitope-paratope space that enables
interpretation of the potential for synergistic escape between residues based on relative
node positions. We present both the full network model for the entire set of PADS (Figure
S6), as well as a reduced network model for just the top 50% most antigenic PADS on
RBD and the top 75% most antigenic PADS on NTD (Figure 2).
The network model of RBD PADS broadly includes the epitope regions defined in
Figures 1 and S2 and enables further analysis of within ER and between ER epitope
relationships, such as escape synergy potentials between sets of mutations. Residues
that are centrally-networked within epitope-paratope space clusters appear to be
fundamental across most mAb epitopes within the corresponding epitope region, meaning

Figure 2: RBD and NTD PADs in Continuous Epitope-Paratope Space. Each RBD or
NTD PAD is represented as a node, with node size proportional to estimated antigenicity.
Node positions and edges are determined based on cosine similarity between sites in
epitope-paratope space (Figure 1). Only the PADS scoring in the top 50% of antigenicity
for RBD and 75% for NTD are shown for interpretability (all PADS shown in Figure S5).
The three main clusters RBD residues map to the three RBD ERs shown in Figure 1. The
NTD clusters map to the NTD ‘supersite’ and the DH1052 epitope. Centrally-networked
PADS are key across the ER they are contained within (e.g., E484), while PADS residing
on the ER fringes describe residues that are uniquely important to certain epitopes or
mAb binding modes within that ER (e.g., K417). Key centrally-networked RBD sites are
identified in ER1 (K378, P384) and ER3 (P337, E340), as well as unique sites that that
span ERs (R346). While VOCs exhibit identically convergent evolution at RBD sites
(K417, E484, N501), NTD mutations appear topologically convergent in epitope-paratope
space (e.g., 142/144/246 and 20/80).
that mutations at these residues have the potential to disrupt a large subset of the mAbs
targeting this epitope-region. We see evidence for this effect in residues E484, T470,
I472, and S494 which are centrally-networked within the PADS groups representing ER2,
consistent with experiments demonstrating knockdown of mAbs with distinct binding
modes upon mutation [Zhou et al., 2021; Rees-Spear et al., 2021]. In contrast, residues
that are on the fringes of epitope-paratope space for a given ER cluster appear uniquely

important to a specific epitope or mode of mAb binding within that ER which logically
builds escape synergy between mutations at these sites and the more centrallynetworked PADS within these groups. For example, the triplet K417, E484, and N501
geometrically spans most of ER2 (Figure 2) suggesting that each mutation is playing a
minimally-overlapping role in disturbing mAbs targeting ER2. Likewise for NTD, B.1.351
mutations L18F, D80A, and R246I span much of the supersite while D215 is centrally
networked within the distinct DH1052 epitope. That is, VOC mutations appear efficiently
spread out across epitope-paratope space suggesting that antigenic synergy likely plays
a role in the selection of these mutations and that the epitope-paratope space model
accurately represents this synergy.
The Epitope-Paratope Space Network Model Highlights Synergy Between Key VOC
Escape Mutations
We next interpret the network model by examining the key RBD VOC mutations at
K417, E484K, and N501. Mutations at residue E484 and K417 occur on the VOCs that
are most strongly associated with escape from vaccinated individuals (501Y.V2; [Madhi
et al., 2021]), convalescent individuals (P.1; [Sabino et al., 2021]), and vaccine sera and
mAbs [Wang et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021]. Similarly, N501Y is found on nearly all VOCs
and is more strongly associated with enhanced ACE-2 binding than antigenic escape,
though a moderate escape effect is noted for a subset of mAbs [Zhou et al., 2021]. These
hypotheses align well with our measure of antigenicity at these sites, in which the node
size (estimated antigenicity) of K417 and E484 stand out strongly within the network and
are greater than the node size of N501. Our analysis thus supports hypotheses that
mutations at N501 are driven primarily by factors other than immune evasion, as they
score relatively low on antigenicity but that N501 may still contribute somewhat to escape.
Further, the network indicates that K417 is closely associated with E484 in global RBD
epitope-paratope space (within the ER2 cluster), but relatively distant from E484 within
ER2 (cos(θ) = 0.13; Figure 3A). This finding is consistent with recent reports classifying
K417N/T and E484K as knocking down different discrete antibody classes [Greaney et

al., 2021b]. Further, K417 is relatively isolated from other RBD residues within ER2
suggesting that K417 interacts uniquely with a subset of mAbs within ER2.
L452R was identified as a defining mutation on B.1.617 alongside E484Q [Cherian
et al., 2021] as well as on other VOC including B.1.427 and B.1.429. Our analysis
identifies L452 as antigenic and moderately associated with E484 (cos(θ) = 0.53, Figure
3A) compared to immediately adjacent residues such as E484/F490 (cos(θ) = 0.90) and
more distant residues such as E484/K417 (cos(θ) = 0.13). This suggests that mutations
at L452/E484 have the potential for escape synergy but significantly less so than E484/
K417 and E484/N501. A limitation of our approach is the difficulty in defining a similarity
cutoff that denotes clinically-relevant synergy. Based on experimental evidence and
convergent evolution, low similarities approaching those of K417/E484 (0.13) are very
likely synergistic and a cutoff may eventually prove inferable via observation of VOC
evolution. It is interesting to note that L452R has to our knowledge only been observed
alongside E484Q and not in combination with E484K. Indeed, E484K appears to disrupt
mAb binding to a more significant degree than E484Q across multiple readouts, including
our surface complementarity analysis (data not shown), published escape mapping
experiments [Greaney et al., 2021a], and examination of chemical properties (EàK vs.
EàQ). It is plausible, then, that L452R is relatively more synergistic with E484Q than it is
with E484K. If this hypothesis is supported by additional observations of L452R alongside
E484Q (but not E484K), then a similarity cutoff slightly above 0.53 may be appropriate
for RBD ER2 as sites sharing this degree of mAb overlap could require specific mutational
conditions for relevant synergy. Note also that the mutation T478K, observed on
B.1.617.2, occupies a highly unique fringe position in epitope-paratope space (Figure S6),
but is not one of the highest scoring PADS included in Figure 2. Still, other mutations
within ER2 appear to have a clearer basis for synergy with E484.

Figure 3: Most Antigenic PADS According to Epitope Distance from E484. (A) A submodel containing only the ER2 PADS is shown with edges and node positions determined
solely based on epitope distance from E484. This model isolation simplifies interpretation
of potential synergy between mutations at residues within the ACE2 binding site and
E484. Notably, within the E484-adjacent group K417 and N501 are relatively distant from
E484. L452 is relatively closer to E484 yet still further than immediately adjacent sites
such as F490 and F486. (B) The PADS with the top 50% of antigenicity scores are shown
on RBD, and colored according to their distance from E484 in epitope space. Colors map
as follows: PADS that are E484-overlapping in epitope space are highlighted in green
(networked to a highly similar set of mAbs), E484-proximal in blue (networked to a partially
overlapping set of mAbs), E484-intermediate in magenta, and E484-distant in red
(networked to a distinct set of mAbs).

Future Synergistic Mutations Within or Proximal to the ACE2 Binding Surface and NTD
Supersite
In addition to K417 and N501, residues on the 443-450 loop also occupy a
relatively distant position within the E484-proximal group (ER2) with highest antigenicity
estimated for mutations at K444 (cos(θ) = 0.17) and V445 (cos(θ) = 0.11). Residues on
this loop have been shown to have high binding escape from sera and have been
proposed as future escape mutants on VOCs [Greaney et al., 2021a]. Our antigenicity
and synergy analyses are consistent with these predictions given that these sites
measure similarly to K417 and N501 in terms of distance from E484 in epitope-paratope
space. With E484/(444, 445) cosine similarities lower than E484/K417, we expect these
sites to be sufficiently orthogonal to provide escape synergy in combination with
mutations at E484. Further, these sites are also distant from K417 (cos(θ) = 0.06),
indicating that mutations at K444 and V445 may prove synergistic with VOCs bearing
both E484K and K417N/T. Whether these two sites on the 443-450 loop or others which
we predict to have lesser antigenicity and lesser synergy such as 450 are mutated will
also depend on fitness considerations not examined here beyond our determination that
these sites are not substantially constrained to mutate—a limitation of this work. However,
we note that certain sites on this loop such as N450 are substantially closer to E484 in
epitope-paratope space (cos(θ) = 0.52). Other PADS within or adjacent to ER2 that
appear distant in our network model from both E484 and K417 include N439, S443, G446,
P499, and I468/R346, though the last two are somewhat associated with ER3.
Examining NTD, we find a potential explanation for the experimentally observed
differences between VOCs B1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. As mentioned above, the B.1.351
mutations at sites 18, 80, 215, and 246 appear to span the NTD supersite while also
potentially knocking down the DH1052 epitope which contributes to protection in vivo
despite a lack of in vitro neutralization [Li D et al., 2021]. In contrast, P.1 NTD mutations
at sites 20 and 138 are concentrated around the more antigenic mutation at L18
suggesting a degree of antigenic redundancy for these mutations. The P.1 mutation at
site 190 is distant from this triplet cluster, but residue 190 itself appears poorly antigenic

and not well networked to many other antigenic residues (only closely associated with
site 101). Indeed, these findings are consistent with comparisons of sera escape for P.1
and B.1.351 in which B.1.351 is measured to have higher sera escape despite the two
VOCs sharing nearly identical RBD mutations (N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T; [Hoffmann
et al., 2021]). Meanwhile, the B.1.1.7 NTD deletion at site 144 is highly central to the NTD
supersite, consistent with reports of B.1.1.7 NTD escape. Further, deletion at sites 69-70
exist on the supersite edge that is most closely networked to the DH1052 epitope and it
is plausible that the 69-70 deletion provides knockdown of antibodies targeting both the
supersite and the distinct DH1052 epitope, similar to how R346 appears to span RBD
ERs 1 and 2. While identically convergent evolution has not been observed for NTD as it
has for RBD, our epitope-paratope space mapping provides evidence of functionally
convergent NTD antigenic evolution. That is, in epitope-paratope space, both B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351 share a similar topological constellation of mutations (144 mapping to 246, and
69-70 mapping to 18, 80, and 242), while P.1 so far lacks this constellation, and this fact
may explain P.1’s slightly weaker escape from neutralization. Further, multiple B.1.617
lineages have emerged bearing a number of mutations within the NTD that are consistent
with the proposed convergent evolution in epitope-paratope space. In particular,
mutations at site 142 occupy a highly overlapping position with those observed at 144
and 246 on for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Similarly, mutations at site 19 are consistent with the
mutations observed at sites 18 and 20 on for B.1.351 and P.1. In contrast, mutations and
deletions at sites 154, 156, 157, and 158 occur on the southern fringe of the NTD
supersite, a location in space not perturbed for other VOC. Still, these sites are predicted
to be antigenic, indicating that B1.617 lineages may have enhanced escape relative to
other VOC from mAbs targeting the NTD via the mode of binding mediated by this fringe,
which is most strongly associated with CDRL3 of mAbs 4-18 and S2X333.
Future Synergistic Mutations Distant from the ACE2 Binding Surface
The epitope-paratope space model highlights regions of epitope-paratope space
which might provide synergistic escape with existing VOC mutations. There are two
primary RBD PADS groups distal from E484, K417, and N501; one on the left-side of the

network which is somewhat associated with the 443-450 loop and maps to ER3, and one
in the upper right portion of the network which is largely isolated and maps to ER1.
Antibodies binding residues where these mutations occur have essentially zero
connection to E484/K417/N501 in epitope-paratope space and thus are most likely
unaffected by mutations at these sites, unless via long-range allosteric interactions which
are not measured by our indirect epitope networking calculation. Cosine similarity for all
of these sites versus E484 is zero or nearly zero. Most of these sites reside on distinct
RBD surfaces from E484 yet distance in epitope-paratope space does not map directly
to surface distance, particularly within ERs (Figure 3B). While these sites have essentially
zero connection to E484, a number of these sites have some degree of association with
other PADS within ER2 (Figure S6).
Mutations at these VOC-distant PADS that prove to have an immune evasion
effect are most likely to result in completely synergistic escape with variants bearing
E484K and K417N/T. However, a potential “saving grace” is that a subset of these
residues is not exposed in RBD-down and may be associated with escape from antibody
binding but not neutralization [Greaney et al. 2021a]. Still, clinically-developed mAbs
targeting these residues are capable of neutralization via avidity [Liu et al., 2020] or other
mechanisms, and potently neutralizing antibodies targeting these residues have been
isolated from the sera of convalescent individuals (EY1A, [Zhou et al., 2020]). Further,
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that fail to neutralize in vitro can still contribute to in vivo
protection as evidenced by DH1052 [Li D et al., 2021]. A number of the residues in these
groups such as P337, E340, and R346 are surface exposed and have been documented
as escape mutants from neutralizing mAbs [Cathcart et al., 2021; Weisblum et al., 2020].
Antigenic mutations at these epitopes may only be significantly selected for after certain
conditions are met, such as 1) dominant ACE2 epitopes have been sufficiently knocked
down, and 2) a critical level of the population has been infected or vaccinated such that
antigenic mutations provides a sufficiently high fitness advantage. Alternatively, novel
epitopes formed by mutations at the ACE2 binding site may also prove more
immunologically-relevant than these distal epitopes with relatively lower neutralizing
potential, such that antibodies targeting the mutated ACE2 epitopes still dominate the
sera response. Still, the identified sites at these epitopes are valuable to surveil. The

distant residues that our model predicts to be the most antigenic and synergistic with VOC
mutations are: N334, P337, E340, R346, K356, K378, P384, L390, I434, A435, V445,
and K462, with lower ranking hits identified in the supplement (Figure S6). Similarly, for
NTD our model suggests that P.1 might achieve additional escape from NTD antibodies
by acquiring mutations at sites proximal to 144 and 246 in epitope space—for example
sites 47, 142-147, and 246-248—as well as central to the DH1052 epitope (e.g. 212, 215,
or 266).
Mutations at PADS Have Been Observed on VOCs
VOCs have now been observed with mutations at a number of PADS. According
to NextStrain as of 3/22/21, the 501Y.V2 lineage has mutations at PADS 348, 352, 359,
367, 382, 384, 408, 427, 430, 434, 435, 439, 440, 443, 444, 445, 456, 450, 457, 476, and
478, where bolded residues score in the top 50% of PADS [nexstrain.org]. In particular,
P384 has 4 mutations to S/L on 501Y.V2 (Ireland/D-NVRL-21IRL42037/2021, GISAID
EPI ISL: 1117762, Zoe Yandle et al.; SouthAfrica/Tygerberg-446/2020, GISAID EPI ISL:
745179, Engelbrecht et al.; SA/NHLS-UCT-GS-9117/2020, GISAID EPI ISL: 1040685,
Iranzadeh et al). 501Y.V3 has few available sequences (375 in NextStrain as of 3/22/21),
and no observed mutations yet at PADS. Many 501Y.V1 sequences are available, with
mutations observed at PADS: 337, 354, 356, 367, 372, 376, 390, 394, 408, 430, 440,
445, 446, 455, 468, 471, 475, 478, 483, 490, and 494. The epitope-paratope space model
highlights how mutations observed on 501Y.V1—which does not have E484K—differ
substantially from those observed on 501Y.V2. That is, 501Y.V1 lacks E484K and we
observe mutations at sites that are in close proximity to E484 in epitope-paratope space
(483, 490, 494) and so may be playing a similar antigenic role in the absence of E484
mutations. On the other hand, 501Y.V2 bears E484K and we have not yet observed
mutations at proximal sites potentially due to antigenic redundancy with E484K.

In this study, we have classified all RBD residues according to their role as
continuous epitope constituents on RBD using mAb/nanobody-RBD/NTD complexes to
approximate the polyclonal sera response. Further, we classified RBD mutations
according to their estimated mutational constraints and scored mutable residues
according to their estimated antigenicity to identify a set of potential antigenic drift sites
(PADS) on RBD and NTD. Finally, we developed a continuous epitope-paratope space
representation of the RBD and NTD PADS allowing visualization of each residue’s
position in this space relative to all other RBD and NTD PADS. In particular, this model
facilitates interpretation of the degree to which newly observed mutations might be
antigenically synergistic with existing VOC mutations. The model provides evidence of
topologically convergent evolution of NTD mutations across current VOCs. Further, the
model assists interpretation and helps build intuition toward why certain VOC mutations
are observed together such as E484K and K417N/T while others are not. We highlight
PADS that offer the potential for synergistic escape with existing VOCs, both within and
distant from the ACE2 binding surface and the NTD supersite. We advise careful
observation of these sites on VOCs and highlight the potential for using these data to
guide proactive surveillance and vaccine design.

Methods
RBD-mAb Networking Calculations: For each protein or protein-complex, significant
interaction network (SIN) scores between every pair of residues within the structure were
computed based on side-chain interactions as described previously [Soundararajan et
al., 2011]. Given that the SIN computation is based on side chains, glycine networking
was interpolated from nearby residues. Using the SIN output, the following metrics were
defined. Within RBD Networking: The sum of all interactions between a given residue on
RBD and all other residue on RBD. Direct Paratope Networking: For a given residue on
RBD, the sum of all interactions between the RBD residue and all residues on the
complexed antibody/nanobody. Indirect Paratope Networking: For a given residue on
RBD, the sum of all interactions between the RBD residue and all other residues on RBD
which are directly networked to an antibody/nanobody paratope. Total Paratope
Networking: For a given residue on RBD, the sum of direct and indirect paratope
networking scores. Note that for all networking measures, scores are normalized to the
highest networking score within each RBD-mAb complex before they are subsequently
compared. For subsequent computations that sought to control for mAb-epitope bias,
networking scores at each epitope residue were normalized to the number of mAbs
interacting with the given residue.
RBD Mutations and Surface Complementarity Calculations: We used PyRosetta to
model the impact of RBD SNPs on the surface complementarity of the RBD-mAb
complexes [Chaudhury et al., 2010]. For each mutation, the wild type complex was first
repacked, the mutation was performed, side chains were repacked, and the interface
surface complementarity was computed using the Interface Analyzer Mover. Absolute
surface complementarity perturbations were scored relative to the wild type interface
surface complementarity.
External Dataset Import and Processing: GISAID sequences were accessed and
downloaded on 1/29/21 [Shu et al., 2017]. Mutation frequencies at all RBD residue were
computed for every observed mutation. For ACE2 Binding [Starr et al., 2020], RBD

Expression [Starr et al., 2020], and Sera Escape [Greaney et al., 2021a] datasets, raw
data were downloaded from the Bloom Lab Github: https://github.com/jbloomlab. For all
3 datasets, the average values across both experiments and all patient samples were
used for each mutation. For residue-level computations, mutation scores were averaged
for SNPs only. The set of RBD SNPs was determined using a custom script and computed
on the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NCBI RefSeq NC_045512.2).
mAb-epitope clustering and Heatmap: mAb-epitope clustering: Direct, Indirect, and
Total networking scores for each residue across all mAb and nanobody complexes were
plotted using clustermap from the Seaborn statistical data visualization package with the
‘correlation’ distance metric and the ‘average’ linkage method [Waskom 2021]. Mutability
Clustering: Mutability clustering of all RBD SNPs was performed using the computational
and experimental features described in Table S1. GISAID mutation frequencies were logtransformed, all features were standardized, and then spectral clustering was performed
on the affinity matrix generated using the pairwise Euclidean distances of the mutations
based on the features (sklearn SpectralClustering [Pedregosa et al., 2011]). Clustering
graphs were visualized using tSNE, and the accompanying cluster descriptions were
computed as average scores for each feature for each cluster, except for the GISAID
feature which was reported as the percentage of the cluster with an observed mutation in
GISAID.
Epitope Normalization and Epitope-Paratope Distance: As a preprocessing step
starting from the raw networking matrix (Figure 1), we first apply the epitope bias
correction, in which the networking scores for each residue are normalized using the
number of mAbs and nanobodies interacting with each RBD/NTD residue. This step
removes bias due to over- or under-sampling of mAbs/nanobodies interacting with a given
epitope within our set of complexes. Next, we perform a residue-wise (row-wise) cosine
similarity calculation between all pairs of residues. This process yields a single distance
metric between all pairs of RBD residues, describing the distance between the pair in
epitope-paratope space.

Network Model for Antigenicity in Epitope Space: The most antigenic RBD mutation
at each RBD site was chosen, and the top 50% of the most antigenic PADS are depicted
in figure 2, while all PADS are shown in figure S6. Similarly, the top 75% of most antigenic
NTD PADS were chosen. VOC mutants were included regardless of PADS status or
antigenicity to highlight their location in epitope-paratope space. A network model was
constructed in which node size is proportional to antigenicity from PCA (RBD) or total
networking (NTD). Pairwise distance between residue-pairs in epitope-paratope space
(see above method) was used to define edges and edge weightings, and was computed
via the sklearn pairwise_distances function using cosine similarity as the distance metric
[Pedregosa et al., 2011]. For clarity, edges are only draw between nodes with cosine
similarity greater than 0.05 for the top PADS (Figure 2) and 0.25 for the full set of PADS
(Figure S6). Node positions were computed via the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed
algorithm, which computes node position based on edge weights.

Figure 1. Note that not all network connections nor the magnitude of the connections are
shown for illustrative purposes. We find that antigenic and mutable residues tend to have
a relatively small effect on fitness as measured by: ACE2 binding, ACE2 surface
complementarity, RBD expression, within-RBD-networking, and mutation frequency in
GISAID, and a relatively high antigenicity as measured by: direct networking, indirect
networking, and perturbation of surface complementarity across the mAb/nanobody set.
