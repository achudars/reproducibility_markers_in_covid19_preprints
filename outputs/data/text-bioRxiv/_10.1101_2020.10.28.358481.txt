Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients1-4. The active form of remdesivir acts as
a nucleoside analogue and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-25-7.
Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides
before RNA synthesis stalls6,8. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish
the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following
remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3â€™-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next
nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3â€™-nucleotide of the RNA
product is matched with the template base, and this may prevent proofreading by the viral 3â€™-exonuclease that recognizes mismatches9,10. These mechanistic insights should facilitate the quest for improved antivirals that target coronavirus replication.
Coronaviruses use an RdRp enzyme to carry out replication
and transcription of their RNA genome11-15. The RdRp consists
of three non-structural protein (nsp) subunits, the catalytic
subunit nsp1216 and the accessory subunits nsp8 and nsp713,17.
Structures of the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained in free
form18 and with RNA template-product duplexes8,19,20. Together with a prior structure of SARS-CoV RdRp21, these results
have elucidated the RdRp mechanism. For RNA-dependent
RNA elongation, the 3â€™-terminal nucleotide of the RNA product chain resides in the â€“1 site and the incoming nucleoside
triphosphate (NTP) substrate binds to the adjacent +1 site. Catalytic nucleotide incorporation then triggers RNA translocation
and liberates the +1 site for binding of the next incoming NTP.
The nucleoside analogue remdesivir inhibits the RdRp of
coronaviruses5-7,22,23 and shows antiviral activity in cell culture

and animals7,24-26. Remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug
that is metabolized in cells to yield an active NTP analogue7
that we refer to as remdesivir triphosphate (RTP). Biochemical
studies showed that the RdRp can use RTP as a substrate, leading to the incorporation of remdesivir monophosphate (RMP)
into the growing RNA product6,8. After RMP incorporation, the
RdRp extends RNA by three more nucleotides before it stalls6,8.
This stalling mechanism appears to be specific to coronaviruses
because the RdRp of Ebola virus can add five RNA nucleotides
after RMP incorporation before it stalls27.
Recent structural studies trapped RdRp-RNA complexes after remdesivir addition to the RNA product 3â€™-end. One structure contained RMP in the +1 site19, whereas another structure
contained RMP in the â€“1 site8. In both structures, RMP mimics
adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and forms standard Wat-

1 and 2, respectively) (Methods). The annealed RNA scaffolds
were then bound to purified RdRp and subjected to cryo-EM
analysis as described20, resulting in two refined structures (Extended Data Table 1).
The first RdRp-RNA structure (structure 1) was resolved
at 3.1 Ã… resolution (Extended Data Figure 1) and showed that
the RMP was located at position â€“3 of the RNA product strand,
as expected from the design of scaffold 1 (Figure 3a, b). The
RdRp-RNA complex adopted the post-translocated state. The
RNA 3â€™-end resided in the â€“1 site and the +1 site was free to
bind the next NTP substrate. Comparison with our previous
RdRp-RNA complex structure20 did not reveal significant differences. The 1â€™-cyano group of the RMP ribose moiety was
located at position â€“3 and is accommodated there by an open
space in the RNA product-binding site of the RdRp (Figure
3a, b). Thus structure 1 represents an active state of the elongation complex that is poised to add one more nucleotide to the
RNA before stalling, consistent with biochemical results.
The second RdRp-RNA structure (structure 2) was resolved
at 3.4 Ã… resolution (Extended Data Figure 1) and showed that
the RMP moiety was not located at position â€“4, as was expected
from our design of scaffold 2, but was instead located at position
â€“3 (Figure 3a, b). The +1 site was no longer free, as observed
in structure 1, but was occupied by the nucleotide at the RNA
3â€™-end. The RdRp-RNA complex adopts the pre-translocated
state and cannot bind the next NTP substrate. Thus structure
2 indicates that the RMP moiety in the RNA product strand is
not tolerated at position â€“4. These results suggested that remdesivir-induced stalling of the RdRp is due to impaired translocation of the RNA after the RMP reaches register â€“3.
To test the hypothesis that RdRp stalling results from a translocation barrier, we formed a third RdRp-RNA complex with an
RNA scaffold that was identical to that in structure 2 except that
RMP was replaced by AMP, and we determined the resulting
structure 3 at 2.8 Ã… resolution (Figure 3a, b, Extended Data
Figure 1). In structure 3, the RdRp-RNA complex adopted the
post-translocation state and the +1 site was again free, as observed in structure 1. This shows that the unexpected pre-translocated state that we observed in structure 2 was indeed caused
by the presence of RMP, which was not tolerated at position

son-Crick base pairs with uridine monophosphate (UMP) in
the RNA template strand. Thus, these studies explained how
RMP is incorporated into RNA instead of AMP. However, they
do not explain how remdesivir inhibits the RdRp because RdRp
stalling occurs only after three more nucleotides have been added to the RNA6,8.
To investigate remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling, we first investigated how RTP (Figure 1a) influences RdRp elongation activity on an RNA template-product scaffold (Figure 1b) using a
highly defined biochemical system (Methods). Consistent with
a recent study6, we observed that RMP is readily incorporated
into RNA and that the RNA is subsequently elongated by three
more nucleotides before the RdRp stalls (Figure 1c, d). At high
NTP concentrations, RdRp stalling was overcome and the fulllength RNA product was formed despite the presence of RMP
in the RNA product (Figure 1c, d). Thus remdesivir neither acts
as a chain terminator nor as an elongation block, but rather triggers delayed RdRp stalling by an unknown mechanism.
To uncover the mechanistic basis of remdesivir-induced
RdRp stalling, we aimed to determine structures of RdRpRNA complexes containing RMP at defined positions in the
RNA product strand. We prepared RMP-containing RNA oligonucleotides by solid-phase synthesis using 5â€™-O-DMT-2â€™-OTBDMS-protected 3â€™-cyanoethyl diisopropyl phosphoramidite
(Rem-PA), which we synthesized from 1â€™-cyano-4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine (Rem) in four steps (Figure 2a, Methods, Supplementary Information). The presence of RMP in the obtained
RNA oligonucleotides was confirmed by denaturing HPLC and
LC-MS after digestion into mononucleosides (Figure 2b, c). We
further confirmed that the presence of RMP inhibits RNA extension by RdRp on minimal RNA template-product scaffolds
(Figure 2d, e).
The ability to prepare RNAs containing RMP at defined positions enabled us to structurally trap the two states of the RdRp
complex that are relevant for understanding remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. Specifically, we investigated RdRp-RNA
complexes trapped after addition of two or three nucleotides
following RMP incorporation. We prepared RNA scaffolds containing RMP at positions â€“3 or â€“4 by annealing short RMP-containing oligonuclotides to long, loop-forming RNAs (scaffolds

plate strand (Figure 3a, b). The matched RNA 3â€™-end may escape proofreading because the viral exonuclease nsp14 preferentially recognizes a mismatched 3â€™-end9,10. Nevertheless, some
proofreading can occur and this renders remdesivir less efficient5, indicating that the viral exonuclease can remove several
nucleotides from the base-paired RNA 3â€™-end. Such removal of
several RNA nucleotides may require RNA backtracking along
the RdRp, and this may be induced by the viral helicase nsp1329.
While these issues will be studied further, our mechanistic insights may already facilitate the search for compounds with improved potential to interfere with coronavirus replication.

RNA extension assays
Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was carried out as described20. RTP synthesis is described in Supplementary Information. All unmodified RNA oligonucleotides were purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies. The RNA sequence used
for the RNA extension assay (Figure 1c) is /56-FAM/rArArC
rArGrG rArGrA rCrUrC rGrCrG rUrArG rUrUrUrU rCrUrA
rCrGrC rG. The assay was performed as described20, except for
the following changes. The final concentrations of nsp12, nsp8,
nsp7 and RNA were 3 Î¼M, 9 Î¼M, 9 Î¼M and 2 Î¼M, respectively.
The highest concentration of NTPs was 0.5 mM for each nucleotide (ATP or RTP, GTP, UTP and CTP), followed by a two-fold
serial dilution. RNA products were resolved on a denaturing
sequencing gel and visualized by Typhoon 95000 FLA Imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The RNA sequences used for
extending RMP-containing RNA oligonucleotides are: rUrGrA
rGrCrC rUrArC rGrC- rA or rR- rGrUrG (product) and rArArA rCrArC rUrGrC rGrUrA /3ddC/ (template). The extension assay (Figure 2e) was performed as described20, with minor
changes. Reactions were started by addition of UTP (final concentrations: 6.25 Î¼M, 12.5 Î¼M, 25 Î¼M or 250 Î¼M). RNA products were visualized by SYBR Gold (Thermo Fischer) staining
and imaged with Typhoon 9500 FLA Imager (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences).

Preparation of RMP-containing RNA oligonucleotides
1â€™-cyano-4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine (Rem, 1) was converted to the 5â€™-O-DMT-2â€™-O-TBDMS-protected 3â€™-cyanoethyl
diisopropyl phosphoramidite (Rem-PA, 5) in four steps. Details of the synthetic procedures and NMR spectra of isolated
compounds are given in the Supplementary Information. RNA
oligonucleotides were then prepared by solid-phase synthesis
on CPG support (0.6 Âµmol scale) using 2â€™-O-TOM-protected
ribonucleoside phosphoramidites (100 mM in CH3CN) and
ethylthiotetrazol (ETT, 250 mM in CH3CN) as activator, with
4 min coupling time. Rem-PA was used as freshly prepared
solution (100 mM) in dry 1,2-dichloroethane, with a coupling
time of two times 12 min. Detritylation was performed with
3% dichloroacetic acid in dichloromethane. Capping solutions
contained 4-dimethylamino pyridine (0.5 M) in acetonitrile for
Cap A, and acetic anhydride/sym-collidine/acetonitrile (2/3/5)
for Cap B. Oxidation was performed with iodine (10 mM) in
acetonitrile/sym-collidin/water (10/1/5). The oligonucleotides
were deprotected with 25% NH4OH at 25 Â°C for 30 h, followed
by 1 M TBAF in THF for 12 h, and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

â€“4. In conclusion, the RMP moiety in the RNA product strand
gives rise to a translocation barrier that impairs movement of
the RMP from position â€“3 to position â€“4.
Prior observations suggest that the translocation barrier
that we observe here is caused by the presence of the C1â€™-cyano
group in the remdesivir ribose moiety. First, this cyano group is
critical for antiviral potency7. Second, modeling the RMP at position â€“4 of the RNA product strand results in a steric clash with
the side chain of serine-861 in nsp126,8. Indeed, our structural
data strongly support the prior modeling (Figure 3c). Third,
truncation of serine-861 to alanine8,28 or glycine28 renders the
RdRp less sensitive or insensitive, respectively, to inhibition
by remdesivir. We conclude that the translocation barrier that
we observe here results from the sterically impaired passage of
the cyano group in RMP past the serine-861 side chain in the
nsp12 subunit of RdRp. We have summarized the mechanism
of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling in a molecular animation
(Supplementary Video).
Finally, our results suggest how the remdesivir-stalled state
escapes viral proofreading. In our structure 2, the RNA product
3â€™-nucleotide is matched and base-paired with the RNA tem3

Therefore, all data were collected with 30Â° tilt to obtain more
particle orientations. Motion correction, CTF-estimation, and
particle picking and extraction were performed on the fly using
Warp32. In total, 8,004, 11,764 and 7,043 movies were collected
for structures 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Analysis of RMP-containing RNA oligonucleotides
The purity and identity of the RNA oligonucleotides was analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC (Dionex DNAPac PA200,
2x250 mm, at 60 Â°C. Solvent A: 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M
Urea. Solvent B: 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M Urea, 0.5 M NaClO4. Gradient: linear, 0â€“40% solvent B, 4% solvent B per 1 CV),
and HR-ESI-MS (Bruker micrOTOF-Q III, negative ion mode,
direct injection). An aliquot (200 pmol in 25 ÂµL) was digested
by snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPD, 0.5 U) in the presence of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP, 0.5 U) in 40 mM
Tris. pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, and the resulting mononucleosides
were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS using an RP-18 column (Synergi

ion source operated in positive ion mode (capillary voltage: 4.5
kV, end plate offset: 500 V, nitrogen nebulizer pressure: 1.4 bar,
dry gas flow: 9 L/min). Extracted ion chromatograms and UV
absorbance traces at 245 nm confirmed presence of remdesivir.

Cryo-EM data processing and analysis
For structure 1, 1.8 million particles were exported from Warp32
1.0.9 to cryoSPARC33 2.15. After ab initio refinement of five
classes, an intermediate map from the previous processing of
EMD-1100720 was added as a 6th reference, and supervised 3D
classification was performed. 654k particles (37%) from the
best class deemed to represent the polymerase were subjected
to 3D refinement to obtain a 3.1 Ã… map. Half-maps and particle
alignments were exported to M34 1.0.9, where reference-based
frame series alignment with a 2x2 image-warp grid as well as
CTF refinement were performed for two iterations. Although
the resulting map had the same 3.1 Ã… nominal resolution, the
features of interest were significantly cleaner.
For structure 2, 3.4 million particles were exported from
Warp 1.0.9 to cryoSPARC 2.15. After ab initio refinement of
5 classes, the EMD-11007-related reference was added as a 6th
reference, and supervised 3D classification was performed. To
further clean up the resulting 881k particles (26%) from the
best class deemed to represent the polymerase, another ab initio refinement of five classes was performed. Three of these
classes and the EMD-11007-related reference were used for supervised 3D classification. 474k particles (54%) from the best
class deemed to represent the polymerase were subjected to
3D refinement to obtain a 3.6 Ã… map. Half-maps and particle
alignments were exported to M 1.0.9, where reference-based
frame series alignment with a 2x2 image-warp grid as well as
CTF refinement were performed for two iterations to obtain a
3.4 Ã… map.
For structure 3, 2.2 million particles were exported from
Warp 1.0.9 to cryoSPARC 2.15. Initial unsupervised 3D classification in three classes was performed using the EMD-11007-related reference. To further clean up the resulting 1.1 million
particles (23%), ab initio refinement of 5 classes was performed.
Four of these classes and the EMD-11007-related reference
were used for supervised 3D classification. 819k particles (70%)
from the best class deemed to represent the polymerase were
subjected to 3D refinement to obtain a 3.1 Ã… map. Half-maps
and particle alignments were exported to M 1.0.9, where reference-based frame series alignment with a 2x2 image-warp grid
as well as CTF refinement were performed for three iterations
to obtain a 2.8 Ã… map.

Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was prepared as described20. RNA scaffolds
for RdRp-RNA complex formation were prepared by mixing
equimolar amounts of two RNA strands in annealing buffer (10
mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) and heating to 75 Â°C,
followed by step-wise cooling to 4 Â°C. RNA sequences for RMP
at position -3 (structure 1) are: rUrUrU rUrCrA rUrGrC rArUrC rGrCrG rUrArG rGrCrU rCrArU rArCrC rGrUrA rUrUrG
rArGrA rCrCrU rUrUrU rGrGrU rCrUrC rArArU rArCrG
rGrUrA and rUrGrA rGrCrC rUrArC rGrCrG rRrUrG. RNA
sequences for AMP/RMP at position -4 (structures 2 and 3)
are: rUrUrU rUrCrA rUrGrC rArCrU rGrCrG rUrArG rGrCrU rCrArU rArCrC rGrUrA rUrUrG rArGrA rCrCrU rUrUrU
rGrGrU rCrUrC rArArU rArCrG rGrUrA and rUrGrA rGrCrC rUrArC rGrC- rA/rR -rGrUrG. RdRp-RNA complexes
were formed by mixing purified nsp12 (scaffold 1: 2 nmol, scaffold 2: 2 nmol, scaffold 3: 1.6 nmol) with an equimolar amount
of annealed RNA scaffold and 3-fold molar excess of each nsp8
and nsp7. After 10 minutes of incubation at room temperature,
the mixture was applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 3.2/300 size
exclusion chromatography column, which was equilibrated in
complex buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1
mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP) at 4 Â°C. Peak fractions corresponding to the RdRp-RNA complex were pooled and diluted to approximately 2 mg/ml. For structure 2, an additional 0.36 nmol
of annealed RNA scaffold were spiked into the sample prior to
grid preparation. 3 ÂµL of the concentrated RdRp-RNA complex
were mixed with 0.5 Âµl of octyl ÃŸ-D-glucopyranoside (0.003%
final concentration) and applied to freshly glow discharged R
2/1 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil). The grids were blotted for
5 seconds using a Vitrobot MarkIV (Thermo Fischer Scientific)
at 4 Â°C and 100% humidity and plunge frozen in liquid ethane.
Cryo-EM data were collected using SerialEM31 on a 300 keV
Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fischer
Scientific). Prior to detection, inelastically scattered electrons
were filtered out with a GIF Quantum energy filter (Gatan)
using a slit width of 20 eV. Images were acquired in counting
mode (non-super resolution) on a K3 direct electron detector
(Gatan) at a nominal magnification of 105,000x resulting in a
calibrated pixel size of 0.834 Ã…/pixel. Images were exposed for
a total of 2.2 seconds with a dose rate of 19 e-/px/s resulting in
a total dose of 60 e-/Ã…2, which was fractionated into 80 frames.
Previous cryo-EM analysis of the SARS-CoV2 RdRp showed
strong preferred orientation of the RdRp particles in ice20.

Model building and refinement
Models were built using our previously published SARS-CoV-2
RdRp structure as starting model (PDB 6YYT)20. For each of the
structures 1â€“3, the model was first rigid-body fit into the density and subsequently adjusted in real-space in Coot35. Parts of the
N-terminal NiRAN domain of nsp12, the N-terminal extension
of nsp8a and the entire nsp8b molecule were removed due to
absence or poor quality of density for these regions. Restraints
for RMP were generated in phenix.elbow36 and the structures
were refined using phenix.real_space_refine37 with appropriate
secondary structure restraints. Model quality was assessed using MolProbity within Phenix38 which revealed excellent stereochemistry for all three structural models (Extended Data Table
1). Figures were prepared with PyMol and ChimeraX39.

Supplementary Video | Animation of remdesivir-induced
RdRp stalling.
Remdesivir (purple, C1â€™-cyano group in van der Waals surface
rendering) binds to the +1 site and base pairs with a uridine
in the template strand (blue) and is then incorporated into the
growing RNA product (light red). For simplicity, NTP binding
and release of pyrophosphate were omitted and instead only the
RMP moiety is shown as it is added to RNA. Translocation of
the RNA then transfers the RNA product 3â€™-nucleotide from
position +1 to position â€“1. Such nucleotide addition cycle is
repeated three more times using cognate, natural nucleotides
(red). After addition of the third nucleotide, translocation is impaired because the C1â€™-cyano group of remdesivir encounters
the side chain of serine-861 (shown in van der Waals surface
rendering) of RdRp subunit nsp12. The translocation barrier
is indicated by failed attempts to translocation that are shown
twice for clarity. Location of the RdRp active site is indicated by
a magenta sphere.
