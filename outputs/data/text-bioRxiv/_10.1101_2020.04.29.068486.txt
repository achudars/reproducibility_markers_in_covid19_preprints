Abstract
The dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the cell
surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate (HS) for the regulation of homeostasis is exploited
by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion. The closely related
polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS
and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin
prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated
coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. We have previously
demonstrated that unfractionated heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding
domain, induces a conformational change and have reported the structural features of heparin
on which this interaction depends. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low
molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces
conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular
weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These findings may have further implications for the rapid development of a
first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins, as well as for nextgeneration, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members
of the Coronaviridae.

Introduction
Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a
polydisperse, heterogenous natural product. Unfractionated heparin (UFH), low
molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and heparinoids are clinically approved as
anticoagulants / thrombotics with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability and
pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which, lacking
significant anticoagulant activity 1, are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite
possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including
coronaviridae and SARS-associated coronavirus strains 2,3, in addition to flaviviruses 4,5,
herpes 6, influenza 7 and HIV 8,9.
Traditional drug development processes are slow and ineffective against emerging
public health threats such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which
makes the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative. Heparin, a
well-tolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over
80 years and alongside its anticoagulant activities, its ability to prevent viral infection,
including coronaviridae, has been described1. Furthermore, the closely related
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) member, heparan sulfate (HS), is known to bind CoV
surface proteins and to be used by coronavirus for its attachment to target cells10. Low
molecular weight heparins are derived from unfractionated heparin by different
chemical and enzymatic depolymerisation processes. Ultimately, despite being
chemically distinct, they do share common chemical features amongst themselves and
those from the parent, unfractionated heparin.
Currently, there are no commercially available medicinal products designed to treat
and/or prevent infections associated with the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak.
Here, we describe preliminary observations suggesting LMWHs have the ability to
interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD, as previously demonstrated for unfractionated
heparin2.

Methods & Materials
2.1 Recombinant expression of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
Residues 330−583 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (GenBank: MN908947) were
cloned upstream of a N-terminal 6XHisTag in the pRSETA expression vector and
transformed into SHuffle® T7 Express Competent E. coli (NEB, UK). Protein expression
was carried out in MagicMedia™ E. coli Expression Media (Invitrogen, UK) at 30°C for
24 hrs, 250 rpm. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 5 mL lysis buffer (BugBuster
Protein Extraction Reagent, Merck Millipore, UK; containing DNAse) and incubated at
room temperature for 30 mins. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies using IMAC
chromatography under denaturing conditions. On-column protein refolding was
performed by applying a gradient with decreasing concentrations of the denaturing agent
(6 - 0 M Urea). After extensive washing, protein was eluted using 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH
8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged to
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH
7.4; Lonza, UK) using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, UK). Recombinant

protein was stored at -20°C until required.
2.2 Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD by circular
dichroism spectroscopy
The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in PBS was recorded
using a J-1500 Jasco CD spectrometer (Jasco, UK), Spectral Manager II software
(JASCO, UK) and a 0.2 mm pathlength, quartz cuvette (Hellma, USA) scanning at 100
nm.min-1 with 1 nm resolution throughout the range λ = 190 - 260 nm. All spectra obtained
were the mean of five independent scans, following instrument calibration with
camphorsulfonic acid. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to spectral
analysis) using a 5 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at 12,000 g, thrice
and CD spectra were collected using 21 μl of a 0.6 mg.ml-1 solution in PBS, pH 7.4.
Spectra of UFH (porcine mucosal heparin) and LMWHs were collected in the same
buffer at approximately comparable concentrations, since these are disperse materials.
Collected data were analysed with Spectral Manager II software prior to processing with
GraphPad Prism 7, using second order polynomial smoothing through 21 neighbours.
Secondary structural prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server11.To
ensure that the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence UFH or
LMWH alone did not arise from simply from the addition of the carbohydrate (this class
of carbohydrates are known to possess CD spectrum at high concentrations 12,13), the
difference spectrum was analysed for each carbohydrate in order to verify that the
change in the CD spectrum arose from a conformational change following binding to the
test carbohydrate.
2.3 Surface Plasmon Resonance determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding
to unfractionated heparin.
Human FGF2 was produced as described by Duchesne et al.16. Porcine mucosal
heparin was biotinylated at the reducing end using hydroxylamine biotin (ThermoFisher,
UK) as described by Thakar et al. 17. Heparin (20 µl of 50 mg.ml-1) was reacted with 20
µl hydroxylamine-biotin in 40 µl 300 mM aniline (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and 40 µl 200 mM
acetate pH 6 for 48 h at 37 °C. Free biotin was removed by gel-filtration chromatography
on Sephadex G25 (GE LifeSciences, UK).
A P4SPR, multi-channel Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) instrument (Affinté
Instruments; Montréal, Canada) was employed with a gold sensor chip that was plasma
cleaned prior to derivatization. A self-assembled monolayer of mPEG thiol and biotin
mPEG was formed by incubating the chip in a 1 mM solution of these reagents at a 99:1
molar ratio in ethanol for 24 hrs18. The chip was rinsed with ethanol and placed in the
instrument. PBS (1X) was used as the running buffer for the three sensing and a fourth
background channel at 500 µl.min-1, using an Ismatec pump. Twenty micrograms of
streptavidin (Sigma, UK; 1 ml in PBS) were injected over the four sensor channels.
Subsequently, biotin-heparin (1 ml) was injected over the three sensing channels.
Binding experiments used PBS with 0.02% Tween 20 (v/v) as the running buffer. The
ligand was injected over the three sensing channels, diluted to the concentration
indicated (see figures) at 500 µl.min-1. Sensor surfaces with bound FGF2 were
regenerated by a wash with 2 M NaCl (Fisher Scientific, UK). However, this was found
to be ineffectual for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD. Partial regeneration of the surface was

achieved with 20 mM HCl (VWR, UK) and only 0.25 % (w/v) SDS (VWR, UK) was found
to remove the bound protein. After regeneration with 0.25 % (w/v/) SDS, fluidics and
surfaces were washed with 20 mM HCl to ensure all traces of the detergent were
removed. Background binding to the underlying streptavidin bound to the mPEG/biotin
mPEG self-assembled monolayer was determined by injection over the control channel.
Responses are reported as the change in plasmon resonance wavelength, in nm and

Results
3.1 Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein by
circular dichroism spectroscopy.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy detects changes in protein secondary structure
that occur in solution using UV radiation. Upon binding, conformational changes are
detected and quantified using spectral deconvolution 19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
underwent conformational change in the presence of LMWHs (Figures 1 - 6). These
observed changes further demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts not only
with UFH, but also, with its low molecular weight derivatives.

Discussion and Conclusion
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant challenge to global health
authorities and, as there are no currently approved drugs to treat, prevent and/or
mitigate its effects, this makes repurposing existing drugs both a timely and appealing
strategy. Unfractionated heparin and LMWHs are well-tolerated anticoagulant drugs,
that have been used successfully for many years with limited and manageable side
effects.
Studying SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein structure and behaviour in solution is a vital step
for the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Here, the ability of
the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind pharmaceutical LMWHs has been studied using
spectroscopic techniques. The data show that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to LMWHs
and that upon binding, significant structural changes are induced.
The glycosaminoglycans class of carbohydrates are present on almost all mammalian
cells and play a central role in the strategy employed by coronaviridae to attach to host
cells. The GAG heparin has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-associated
coronavirus cell invasion 2,3,13 and this, in concert with the LMWH data presented within
this study, supports the use of GAG-derived pharmaceuticals as therapeutic agents
against SARS-associated coronavirus. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for
the repurposing of LMWHs as antiviral agents, providing a rapid countermeasure
against the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
It is noteworthy that even pharmaceutical-grade UFH and LMWH preparations remain
a polydisperse mixture of natural products, containing both anticoagulant and nonanticoagulant saccharide structures. These may prove to be an invaluable resource for
next-generation, biologically active, antiviral agents that display negligible
anticoagulant potential, whilst the former remains tractable to facile, chemical (and
enzymatic) engineering strategies to ablate their anticoagulation activities.
The further subfractionation of existing LMWH preparations against anticoagulant
activities (with proven low-toxicity profiles, good bioavailability and industrial-scale
manufacturing) for off-label pathologies, provides an attractive strategy for quickly and
effectively responding to COVID-19 and for the development of next generation
heparin-based therapeutics.
Such drugs will be amenable to routine parenteral administration through currently
established routes and additionally, direct to the respiratory tract via nasal
administration, using nebulised heparins, which would be unlikely to gain significant
access to the circulation. Thus, the anticoagulant activity of UFH and LMWHs, which
can in any event be engineered out, would not pose a problem. Importantly, such a
route of administration would not only be suitable for prophylaxis, but also for patients
under mechanical ventilation 20.

Supplementary Figure 1: The conformational change of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD observed in the
presence of fondaparinux by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. (A) Circular dichroism spectra (190 260 nm) of nCovS1RBD alone (black solid line), heparin (red solid line) and fondaparinux (blue) in PBS, pH
7.4. The dotted vertical line indicates 193 nm. (B) Details of the same spectra expanded between 200 and 240
nm. Vertical dotted lines indicate 222 nm and 208 nm. (C) Secondary structure content analysed using BeStSel
for nCovS1RBD. α helical secondary structure is characterized by a positive band at ~193 nm and two negative
bands at ~208 and ~222 nm (analysis using BeStSel was performed on smoothed data between 190 and 260
nm.
