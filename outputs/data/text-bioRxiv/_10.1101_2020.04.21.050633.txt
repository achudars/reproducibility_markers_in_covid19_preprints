Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has rapidly spread across the globe. In the Netherlands,
the first case of SARS-CoV-2 has been notified on the 27th of February. Here, we describe the
first three weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the Netherlands, which started with several
different introductory events from Italy, Austria, Germany and France followed by local
amplification in, and later also, outside the South of the Netherlands. The timely generation
of whole genome sequences combined with epidemiological investigations facilitated early
decision making in an attempt to control local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands.

Introduction
Late December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology were reported in
connection with a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China1. The virus responsible was
tentatively named SARS-CoV-22 and it rapidly spread throughout the world. By April 16th the
virus had spread to 185 different countries, infected over 2,000,000 people and resulted in
over 130,000 deaths3.
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful tool to understand transmission
dynamics of (viral) outbreaks. Recently, several outbreaks of zoonotic viral pathogens have
been reconstructed using genomic information4–7. Equally, WGS can be used to inform
outbreak control decisions. Evidence of this was seen during the 2014-2016 West African
Ebola outbreak when real-time WGS was used to help public health decision making, a
strategy for which the term "precision public health pathogen genomics" has been dubbed8,9.
In this definition, the use of WGS can provide a more detailed picture of the sources of
infection and transmission chains. Immediate sharing and combining data during outbreaks is
now recommended as an integral part of outbreak response10–12. Feasibility of real-time WGS
relies on the access to sequence platforms that provide reliable sequences, access to
metadata for interpretation, and data analysis at high speed and low cost. Therefore, whole
genome sequencing for outbreak support is an active area of research. Nanopore sequencing
has been employed in recent outbreaks of Usutu, Ebola, Zika and Yellow fever virus owing to
the ease of use and relatively low start-up cost4–7. The robustness of this method has recently
been validated using Usutu virus13,14.
In the Netherlands, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on the 27nd of February and
as of April 16th, there were 29,214 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 3,351 patient deaths
attributable to COVID-19 in the Netherlands. The first complete SARS-CoV-2 genome

sequences of the first two patients in the Netherlands were generated, analyzed and shared
on the 29th of February. By March 15th, 189 full genome sequences were generated and
released on GISAID. Here, we demonstrate how this data was generated and how SARS-CoV2 WGS, in combination with epidemiological data, was used to inform public health decision
making in the Netherlands.

Methods
COVID-19 response
This study was done in liaison with the national outbreak response team (ORT). The ORT
develops guidance on case finding and containment, based on WHO and ECDC
recommendations and expert advice, as defined by the crisis and emergency response
structure15,16. The sequencing effort was embedded in the stepwise response to the outbreak
(Figure 1), which evolved from the initial testing of symptomatic travelers according to the
WHO and ECDC case definitions including the testing of symptomatic contacts (phase 1),
followed by inclusion of routine testing of patients hospitalized with severe respiratory
infections (phase 2), to inclusion of health care workers with a low threshold case definition
and testing to define the extent of suspected clusters (phase 3). Depending on the phase and
clinical severity, initial contact with patients was established through public health physicians
or nurses from the municipal health service (for travel related cases, contacts of [hospitalized]
cases, and patients belonging to risk groups). Ethical approval was not required for this study
as only anonymous aggregated data were used, and no medical interventions were made on
human subjects

On January 29th COVID-19 was classified as a notifiable disease in group A in the Netherlands,
with physicians and laboratories having to report any suspected and confirmed case to the
Dutch public health services (PHS) by phone. Upon notification, the PHS initiates source
identification and contact tracing, and performs risk assessments. In the early outbreak phase
(containment), the PHS traced and informed all high and low risk contacts of cases with the
aim to stop further transmission. For each case, epidemiological information such as
demographic information, symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, travel history, contact
information, suspected source, underlying disease, and occupation were registered. Due to
the magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak this quickly became impracticable in severely
affected regions, and the strategy shifted to registering data on confirmed cases only and
informing their high-risk contacts (phase 2) with continued active case finding in less affected
regions. The PHS informed the national public health authority of the Netherlands (RIVM)
about all laboratory confirmed cases. There, a national case registry was kept in which a
contact matrix was kept for the first 250 cases.

SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics
Clinical specimens were collected and phocine distemper virus (PDV) was added as internal
NA extraction control to the supernatant. Clinical specimens included oropharyngeal and
nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum. Total NA was extracted from the
supernatant using Roche MagNA Pure systems. The NA was screened for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 using real-time single-plex RT-PCRs for PDV, for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene and
for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene as described by Corman et al.17.

A SARS-CoV-2 specific multiplex PCR for Nanopore sequencing was performed, similar to
amplicon-based approaches as previously described18. In short, primers for 86 overlapping
amplicons spanning the entire genome were designed using primal19. The amplicon length
was set to 500bp with 75bp overlap between the different amplicons. The used
concentrations and primer sequences are displayed in Supplementary table 1. The libraries
were generated using the native barcode kits from Nanopore (EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114
and SQK-LSK109) and sequenced on a R9.4 flow cell multiplexing up to 24 samples per
sequence run.
In the first phase all samples were selected for sequencing, reflecting travel associated
cases and their contacts. In the second phase priority was given to patients identified through
enhanced case finding by testing of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory disease
(SARI) and continued sequencing of new incursions. In the third phase, the epidemic started
to expand exponentially, and sequencing was done to continue to monitor evolution of the
outbreak. In line with the national testing policy, a significant proportion of new cases
sequenced were healthcare workers.

<30 were replaced with an “N” with a custom script using biopython and pysam. Mutations in
the genome were confirmed by manually checking the alignment and homopolymeric regions
were manually checked and resolved consulting reference genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis
All available full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were retrieved from GISAID (supplementary
table 2) on the 22nd of March 2020 and aligned with the Dutch SARS-CoV-2 sequences from
this study using MUSCLE. Sequences with >10% “Ns” were excluded. The alignment was
manually checked for discrepancies after which IQ-TREE23 was used to perform a maximum
likelihood phylogenetic analysis under the GTR+F+I +G4 model as best predicted model using
the ultrafast bootstrap option with 1,000 replicates. The phylogenetic trees were visualized
using custom python and baltic scripts (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic).

BEAST analysis
All available full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were retrieved from GISAID24,25 on the 18th of
March 2020 and downsampled to include only representative sequences from
epidemiologically linked cases. Sequences lacking date information were also removed from
the dataset. Sequences were aligned with the newly obtained SARS-CoV-2 sequences in this
study using MAFFT26. Bayesian phylogenetic trees were inferred using BEAST27. An
exponential growth model and skygrid model were set to 100,000,000 states with sampling
every 10,000 states. Log files were inspected in Tracer and Tree annotator was used to remove
the burn-in from the tree file and to construct the mcc tree.

Results
After the release of the first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence, a diagnostic assay was quickly
set-up and validated17. Diagnostics were initially performed on suspected cases with a recent
travel history to China, but later also on suspected cases with a recent travel history to parts
of Italy, Germany, Austria or France. In addition, an amplicon-based full genome sequencing
protocol was developed based on the release of the first genomic sequence.
Phase 1: Initial testing of travelers according to the WHO and ECDC case definitions
Starting from the 30th of January symptomatic travelers from countries where SARS-CoV-2
was known to circulate were routinely tested. This resulted in the identification of the first
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Netherlands on February 27th and an additional case one day later.
The genomes of these first two positive samples were generated and analyzed by the February
29th. These two viruses clustered differently in the phylogenetic tree, confirming separate
introductions (Figure 2A).
During the following days the number of reported cases rapidly increased to 321
through screening of symptomatic travelers and symptomatic contacts. Also, more sequence
data was generated: by March 9th local clusters of epidemiologically related cases of SARSCoV-2 started to appear in the province of Noord Brabant. The increase in cases is likely to
have been triggered by multiple introductions of the virus following the spring holidays (from
13th of February to 23rd of February) with travel to ski resorts in Northern Italy (Figure 2B). The
virus also started to appear in other parts of the country (Figure 3A) through which on March
9th the first intervention was put into place: the prime minister advised people to stop shaking
hands. One day later, on the 10th of March, events attended by more than 1,000 visitors were
banned in the province North Brabant.

Phase 2: Inclusion of patients hospitalized with severe respiratory infections
The advice to test hospitalized patients with serious respiratory infections was issued on
February 24rd and subsequent attempts to identify possible local transmission chains triggered
testing for SARS-CoV-2 on a large scale in hospitals. All positive samples were sequenced and
during the following days, whole genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis
revealed the emergence of multiple viral strains that clustered differently in the phylogenetic
tree as well as substantial local amplification of viruses from patients without any travel
history, also outside Noord Brabant (Figure 3B). This information, combined with the increase
in the total number of infections in the Netherlands, led to the decision to implement stricter
measures for the whole country to prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2 on the 12th of March.
All events with over 100 people attending were cancelled, people were requested to work
from home as much as possible and people with symptoms like fever or cough had to stay at
home. On the 15th of March this was followed by the closure of schools, catering industries
and sport clubs.
Phase 3: Systematic sequencing during exponential growth phase
In the third phase sequencing of new cases with emphasis on HCW and severe hospitalized
cases was continued. By March 15nd, 190 SARS-CoV-2 viruses from the Netherlands were
sequenced, at that moment representing 27,1% of the total number of full genome sequences
produced worldwide. The sequences detected in the Netherlands were diverse and revealed
the presence of multiple co-circulating sequence types, found in several different clusters in
the phylogenetic tree (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 1). The diversity was also observed
in cases with similar travel histories, reflecting that sequence diversity already was present in
the originating county, primarily Italy (Figure 4). In addition to travel associated cases, an

increasing number of local cases was detected through SARI surveillance; this was not limited
to the province Noord Brabant but SARS-CoV-2 was also increasing in the provinces Zuid
Holland, Noord Holland and Utrecht, confirming substantial under ascertainment of the
epidemic. We also observed the occurrence of clusters, some of which triggered in depth
investigations to be described elsewhere (Sikkema et al., in preparation). The increase in
COVID-19 patients as well as increasing affected geographic areas and occurrence of local
clusters provided further support for the increased movement restrictions.
Time-resolved analysis
BEAST analysis revealed that the most recent ancestor of the viruses circulating in the
Netherlands dates back to the end of January and the beginning of February (Figure 5). This is
in line with the amplification that occurred in the region (notably Italy and Switzerland) from
which most of the epidemic in The Netherlands was seeded. Most incursions likely occurred
during spring break, which is a popular winter sports vacation area. Retrospective testing
showed the presence of the virus in a sample collected on the 24th of February in a patient
with known travel history to Italy.

Discussion
We show that whole genome sequencing in combination with epidemiological data
strengthened the evidence base for public health decision making in the Netherlands. WGS
enabled a more precise understanding of the transmission patterns in various initial phases of
the outbreaks. As such, we were able to understand the genetic diversity of the multiple
introduction events in phase 1, the extent of local and regional clusters in phase 2 and the
transmission patterns within the HCW groups in phase 3 (among which the absence or
occurrence of very limited nosocomial transmission). This information complemented the
data obtained from more traditional methods such as contact investigation. To yield optimal
value for public health measures, WGS was performed on the basis of questions raised by the
multidisciplinary national response team. This timely generation of whole genome sequences
facilitated early decision making in an attempt to control local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in
the Netherlands.
At the moment, sequences from the Netherlands make up a substantial part of the
total collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Although implementation of WGS in the Dutch
disease prevention and control has shown its added value, there is still only a limited amount
of genomic information available from certain parts of the world, including Italy, and
therefore, conclusions need to be drawn with caution given the inevitable sampling bias of
the dataset. Also, from Iran, another major country where the virus presumably was spreading
exponentially in the week before the take-off of the epidemic in The Netherlands, only
genomic information about exported cases is known. Without a representative and sizable
selection of reference sequences, reliable phylogenetic analysis is difficult for the time being,
although the geographic signature in the dataset is becoming increasingly clear. Clustering,
and conclusions on the origin of viruses may change significantly when virus sequences of

other geographical regions are added to the analysis. Moreover, global monitoring of the
genetic diversity of the virus is essential to reliably model and predict the spread of the virus.
Nonetheless, there are a few observations that can be made: since its emergence, the
global spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to diversification into lineages that reflect ongoing chains of
transmission in specific geographic regions globally, in Europe, and -during the 2nd and 3d
phase- in the Netherlands. This diversification provided the basis for the use of WGS to
investigate possible transmission chains locally, for instance in healthcare settings, where it
can be used to inform infection control and prevention when combined with background data
on contact histories among others. Moreover, the continued effort will lay the foundation for
the enhanced surveillance that will be paramount during the next phase of the pandemic,
when confinement measures will gradually be lifted. Given the widespread circulation, most
likely scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 will (sporadically) re-emerge, and discrimination between
novel introductions versus prolonged local circulation is important to inform appropriate
public health decision. In addition, due to genomic mutations, the phenotype and the
transmission dynamics of the virus might change during time. Therefore, close monitoring of
the behavior of the virus in combination with genetic information is essential as well.
We have used an amplicon-based sequencing approach to monitor the emergence of
SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. A critical step in using amplicon-based sequencing is that
close, reliable reference sequences need to be available. The primers are designed based on
our current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 diversity and therefore need regular updating. In
the future, this may be overcome using metagenomic sequencing. However, at the moment
conventional metagenomic sequencing (Illumina) takes too long for near to real-time
sequencing and Nanopore based metagenomic sequencing is not sensitive enough to allow

recovery of whole genome sequences in a similar fashion and similar costs as compared to
amplicon based Nanopore sequencing.
We provide a first description of the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 into The Netherlands.
The combination of real-time WGS with the data from the National Public Health response
team has provided information that helped decide on next steps in the decision making.
Sharing of metadata is needed within a country but also on a global level. We urge countries
to share sequence information to combine our efforts in understanding the spread of SARSCoV-2. GISAID24,25 made sharing of sequence information coupled to limited metadata
possible in a manner that protects the intellectual property and acknowledges the data
providers. However, in order to fully capitalize on the potential added value of WGS for public
health decision making, systems for combined analysis of data are needed that are in
agreement with general data protection rules. We previously developed a model for
collaborative exploration of WGS and metadata in a protected sharing environment28,29 For
truly global collaboration, such systems would need to be further developed and hosted under
the auspices of WHO.
