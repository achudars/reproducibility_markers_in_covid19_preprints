ABSTRACT

3

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified

4

pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine

5

(HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2

6

infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 µg/mL) to

7

predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral

8

dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic

9

toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the

10

pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal

11

(IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 µg/g (Cmax) in the lung.

12

Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with

13

normalized dose showed higher (~30-fold) lung exposure, longer (~2.5-fold) half-life in lung,

14

but lower blood exposure with ~20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure

15

with 24% of Cmax and 58% of AUC. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics results in an animal

16

model demonstrate the proof of concept that inhalable liposomal HCQ may provide clinical

17

benefit and serve as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

19

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, is inexpensive,

20

safe, and well tolerated by most patient populations, including those with chronic diseases or

21

immunocompromised status. HCQ is a weak diprotic base that can pass through the lipid cell

22

membrane and preferentially concentrate in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles. HCQ is being

23

studied to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), possibly via blocking the

24

interactions between virus and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor as well as

25

sialic acids receptor and has shown potential in vitro (1, 2) and preliminary clinical results (3,

26

4). As of Jul 8, 2020, a total of 232 studies involves HCQ use among 2478 clinical trials for

27

COVID-19 registered with the clinicaltrials.gov.

28

However, the effective in vivo levels as well as the optimal dosing regimen of HCQ for

29

treating COVID-19 remains unclear. The in vitro EC50 values (0.72 to 17.31 µM) proposed

30

for optimized dosing regimens are based on extracellular drug concentration (1, 2). A higher

31

lung (intracellular) concentration to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy was suggested (5).

32

The HCQ concentration (6.7 µg/mL) required to clear 100% of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro might

33

not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen of 800 mg HCQ sulfate

34

orally daily, followed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg given daily for 4 days (2, 6). Further,

35

a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including

36

cardiotoxicity (7).

37

An alternative strategy is needed to bridge the gap between in vitro and clinical use of a

38

potentially effective agent in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. A drug delivery directly to

39

the respiratory tracts while minimizing the systemic exposure is a desirable alternative (5). In

40

this report, a proof-of-concept study was conducted to evaluate the systemic

41

pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles and tissue distribution following a single dose of inhalable

42

liposomal HCQ in a rat model and compared to that of unformulated HCQ through

43

intravenous (IV) delivery.

RESULTS

45

HCQ pharmacokinetics in lung. Upon IT administration of liposomal HCQ,

46

significantly more HCQ disposition (Fig. 1A) and longer half-life in lung was observed

47

compared to that those of HCQ by either IV or IT administration (37.5 hours vs. 15.2 hours

48

and 17.7 hours for HCQ-IV and HCQ-IT, respectively) (Table 1). Notably, even at 72 hours

49

post-dose, liposomal HCQ-IT had 77-fold (to HCQ-IV) and 43-fold (to HCQ-IT) higher

50

HCQ concentrations in lung. A single dose of 0.284 mg liposomal HCQ-IT achieved 129.4

51

g/g in Cmax and 4193.2 h*g/g in AUC0-72 and showed overall greater lung exposure with

52

29-fold in Cmax and 35-fold in AUC0-72 compared to HCQ-IV with normalized dose (Table

53

2).

54

HCQ pharmacokinetics in blood and heart. With IV administration, HCQ showed

55

similar PK profile and systemic exposures as HCQ-IT in overall, including Cmax and AUC

56

(Fig. 1B and Table 1). On the contrary, liposomal HCQ-IT showed significantly lower

57

systemic exposure in blood with only around 20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC0-72 after

58

normalizing dose compared to HCQ-IV (Table 2). As observed in blood, liposomal HCQ-IT

59

showed significantly lower exposure in the heart from 0.25 hours to 24 hours (Fig. 1C and

60

Table 1). With normalized dose, liposomal HCQ-IT yielded only 24% of Cmax and 58% of

61

AUC0-24 compared to HCQ-IV (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

63

In this rat pharmacokinetics study, a significantly higher exposure of HCQ with

64

sustained release in the lung was observed by targeted delivery of inhalable liposomal HCQ,

65

suggesting a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19 pulmonary disease. Fan et al. and

66

others have suggested that significantly higher lung (intracellular) concentrations relative to

67

the in vitro EC50 would be required to achieve in vivo antiviral efficacy SARS-CoV-2 (5, 6).

68

Also, it has been proposed that the prediction of in vivo efficacy should be driven primarily

69

by high lung HCQ concentrations for treatment of viral pneumonia instead of HCQ blood

70

exposure (6). Given the current dosing regimen for oral HCQ is unlikely to produce an

71

antiviral effect, FDA recently revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use HCQ to

72

treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized patients and WHO also stopped the HCQ arm of the

73

COVID-19 Solidarity Trial. Here our findings supported the feasibility of alternative targeted

74

delivery of HCQ to the lungs with potentially effective antiviral levels while minimizing the

75

systemic exposure.

76

The aerosolized delivery of therapeutic drugs to the lower respiratory tract has been

77

applied for the treatment of various lung infectious and inflammatory disorders. For example,

78

aerosolized HCQ (AHCQ) has been applied in clinical trials for asthma and showed well

79

tolerance without significant toxicity after 21 days of dosing (8). In the current study, it is

80

found that HCQ lung exposure remains low with short half-life even with dosing of

81

unformulated HCQ directly to trachea, indicating unformulated HCQ is possibly to be

82

retained in lung only transiently and distributed rapidly from lung to systemic circulation.

83

The results suggest a sustained release formulation of HCQ, like inhalable liposomal HCQ

84

demonstrated here might be able to provide preferentially higher concentrations in the lung

85

than an aerosolized, non-liposomal HCQ formulation.

86

It was demonstrated that the inhalable liposomal formulation could provide efficient

87

aerosolized delivery of liposomal drugs to lung and increase drug exposure in airways and

88

lung with lower doses than used for systemic administration (9). For instance, ARIKAYCE®,

89

an inhalable liposomal amikacin has been developed and accelerated approved by FDA in

90

2018 for treating Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease (10). As shown in this

91

proof-of-concept study, the inhalable liposomal HCQ did increase exposure in the lung with

92

extended residence time compared to systemically administered HCQ. Notably, the

93

significantly increased lung exposure at normalized dose suggested the lung HCQ

94

concentration with in vivo antiviral efficacy could be achieved at a relatively lower dose of

95

inhalable liposomal HCQ than that of oral regimens with loading dose initiation (11).

96

In addition to prolonging the residence time and increasing the exposure in lung,

97

significantly lower effective dose with less dosing frequency of inhalable liposomal HCQ

98

might also reduce systemic exposure and potential adverse events. One of the well-known

99

side effects of HCQ in the treatment of rheumatological disorders is cardiotoxicity, including

100

abnormal heart rhythms such as QTc interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia, a

101

dangerously rapid heart rate (12). In recent study, among 84 COVID-19 patients who

102

received HCQ and azithromycin at NYU’s Langone Medical Center, 11% of them had

103

prolonged QT intervals to be considered at high risk of arrhythmia (13). The present study

104

showed liposomal HCQ-IT not only reduced systemic exposure but also decreased heart

105

tissue distribution of HCQ compared to HCQ-IV. It suggested inhalable liposomal HCQ at a

106

significantly lower effective dose should possess less cardiotoxicity concerns than

107

conventional oral HCQ tablets.

108

While there is no commercially available aerosolized formulation of HCQ, a recent

109

empirical study of inhaled HCQ aerosols at 4 mg per day over one week found it was well

110

tolerated without significant adverse events (14). This further supports the rationale of

111

applying inhalable liposomal HCQ with direct lung targeting in COVID-19 infection/disease

112

prevention and treatment.

113

A limitation of the current study is that the pharmacokinetics of liposomal HCQ were

114

evaluated in a rat model using IT instillation to mimic the intended inhalation administration.

115

The typical lung deposition efficiency with inhaled aerosols is very likely lower than that of

116

the IT instilled microsprayed-droplets. Furthermore, it is suggested the aerosol-generating

117

procedure (nebulization) on patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should be

118

performed cautiously given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through the respiratory

119

route

120

(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html)

121

(15). Therefore, we have developed a disposable closed-loop system connected to the

122

nebulizer to maximize the targeted delivery of inhaled liposomal HCQ while minimize the

123

spreading and contaminating the air and environment (data not shown).

124

In conclusion, this study in a rat model demonstrate the desirable pharmacokinetics of

125

inhalable liposomal HCQ in vivo. It supports the working hypothesis that inhalable liposomal

126

HCQ might serve as a potential treatment option for the delivery of HCQ for COVID-19

127

pulmonary disease by achieving targeted antiviral levels with less frequent dosing and at a

128

relatively lower dose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

130

Drugs and reagents. The study drug (liposomal HCQ) was prepared by Taiwan Liposome

131

Company, Ltd., Taiwan. It is composed of HCQ encapsulated in liposomes with mean

132

particle

133

dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Lipoid GMBH, Germany) and cholesterol (Carbogen

134

Amcis B.V., The Netherlands), both of which are natural components of lung surfactant (16,

135

17). The formulation was manufactured in the following processes. Brieﬂy, appropriate

136

amounts of lipid mixture were dissolved in ethanol (J. T. Baker, USA) and injected to a

137

hydroxychloroquine sulfate (SCI Pharmtech, Inc., Taiwan) solution at 50°C. The size of the

138

liposomes was adjusted to 200 nm by an extruder with 0.2 µm polycarbonate membrane to

139

standardize the sizes of the liposomes. A tangential flow filtration (TFF, VIVAFLOW 200,

140

MWCO 100,000 PES, Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Germany) was used to remove

141

non-incorporated HCQ and ethanol to obtain the liposomal HCQ in 0.9% sodium chloride

142

(Merck KGaA, Germany).

143

Study Design. A total of 52 female SD rats (BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.) were assigned

144

to one of three treatment groups: (1) HCQ-IV: 12 rats received a single dose of 0.590 mg

145

HCQ sulfate per animal via IV injection; (2) HCQ-IT: 20 rats received a single dose of

146

0.590 mg HCQ sulfate per animal via intratracheal (IT) administration; and (3) liposomal

size

around

200 nm.

HCQ-IT: 20 rats received a single dose of 0.284 mg liposomal HCQ sulfate per animal via

148

IT administration. The sampling time points for blood samples were 0.25, 1, 4, 24 and 72

149

hours post-dose and for tissue/organ samples were 0.25, 4, 24 and 72 hours post-dose. In

150

this study, inhalable liposomal HCQ was administered through IT instillation to mimic the

151

intended inhaled administration in a clinical setting. All procedures involving animals were

acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid for protein precipitation. The resulting sample solution

166

was mixed well with 0.1% formic acid to final 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid prior

167

to injection into a LC-MS/MS.

168

Concentrations of HCQ in blood and tissue/organ samples were determined by

169

LC-MS/MS on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC-I CALSS coupled with Water Xevo TQS or AB

170

Sciex Triple Quad 5500. The ACQUITY BEH C18 column (2.1×50 mm) was selected for

171

sample separation with gradient elution consist of 0.1% formic acid in water (mobile phase

172

A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase B) at 0.4 mL/min flow rate.

173

Total run time was 4.5 minutes and the column oven was set at 40°C. The mass

174

spectrometer was set up in MRM mode to monitor the transition 336 → 247 for HCQ. The

175

linear range of the assay is 0.5-500 ng/mL, 0.5-500 ng/mL and 20-10,000 ng/mL for blood,

176

heart and lung assay, respectively. PK parameters of HCQ were calculated by a

177

non-compartmental method using Phoenix® WinNonlin® (version 8.0). Sparse sampling

178

computation was applied for the calculation of PK parameters in tissue/organ.

179

Statistical Analysis. Two-sample t tests were used to assess differences in concentration

180

between liposomal HCQ-IT and HCQ-IV. P < 0.05 is considered significant.
