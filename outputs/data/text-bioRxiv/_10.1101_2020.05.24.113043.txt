ABSTRACT
Detection of viral RNA by PCR is currently the main diagnostic tool for COVID-19 [1]. The PCR-based test,
however, shows limited sensitivity, especially at early and late stages of the disease development [2,3], and is relatively
time consuming. Fast and reliable complementary methods for detecting the viral infection would be of help in the
current pandemia conditions. Mass-spectrometry is one of such possibilities. We have developed a mass-spectrometry
based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs, based on the detection of
the viral nucleocapsid N protein. The N protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus, the most abundant protein in the virion, is
the best candidate for mass-spectrometric detection of the infection, and MS-based detection of several peptides
from the SARS-COoV-2 nucleoprotein has been reported earlier by the Sinz group [4]. Our approach shows confident
identification of the N protein in patient samples even with the lowest viral loads and a much simpler preparation
procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and adding of isopropanol, and tryptic digestion
of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result
of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected. The obtained results can further be
used to create fast parallel mass-spectrometric approaches for the detection of the virus in the nasopharyngeal
mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.
INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). The virus unit consists of a single-stranded RNA with nucleoproteins enclosed within a capsid
containing matrix proteins. The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been sequenced [5], and the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) method is currently the main diagnostics approach for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, it has shown
limited accuracy and sensitivity, giving a high frequency of false positive and false negative results [1-3], and is
relatively time consuming. The detection of viral proteins in body fluids by mass-spectrometry based methods could
serve as a complementary diagnostic tool. In addition, alternative testing assays would allow us to better understand
the biological activity of the virus and to suggest potential drug targets for patient treatment.
SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be grouped into two major classes - structural and non-structural proteins. Nonstructural proteins are encoded by the virus, but are present only in the infected host cells and include the
various enzymes and transcription factors necessary for virus replication. These proteins are not incorporated into the
virion and are not as highly expressed, thus are less likely to be detected. The four structural proteins incorporated in
the virion particle of SARS-CoV-2 virus are known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid)
proteins. The N protein encapsulates and protects the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the
viral envelope. From the data previously obtained for SARS-CoV [6], which has a structure similar to SARS-CoV-2
structure, it can be concluded that the number of copies of E, M, and N proteins is much larger than that of S, but the
E and M are relatively short and tightly membrane-bound proteins, what makes them difficult to extract, detect, and
identify. Thus, the main target for mass-spectrometry based detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the N protein. The possibility
of developing such methods using gargle solution samples of COVID-19 patients have been reported [4]. We have
performed a pilot study on nasopharynx epithelial swabs already collected from patients with CODIV-19 for RT-qPCR

and showed confident identification of the N protein of the SARS CoV-2 virus by mass-spectrometry with the use of a
very basic sample preparation procedure.
Also results on the unique easily detectable peptides characteristic of the infection can further be used as
targets for creating highly specific and sensitive PRM based detection methods or fast parallel mass-spectrometric
approaches based on immunoprecipitation and MALDI analysis (iMALDI), allowing very fast testing for the presence
of the virus in nasopharyngeal mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection
All procedures for collection, transport, and preparation of the samples were carried out according to the
restrictions and protocols of SR 1.3.3118-13 «Safety procedures for work with microorganisms of the I - II groups of
pathogenicity (hazard)». Swabs of the mucosa of the lower part of the nasopharynx and posterior wall of the
oropharynx were used for the study. The sample was collected via a sterile velor swab with a plastic applicator. The
swab was introduced along the outer wall of the nose to a depth of 2-3 cm to the lower shell, and after performing a
rotational movement, was removed along the outer wall of the nose. After obtaining the material, the swab (up to the
place of breakage) was placed into a sterile disposable tube with transport medium, and the end of the probe was
broken off. Oropharyngeal swab samples were taken with a dry sterile viscose swab by rotational movements along
the surface of the tonsils, palatine arches and posterior wall of the oropharynx. In order to increase the viral
concentration both the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were placed into a single tube, which was then
sealed and marked.
The samples were collected from 5 patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by RT-qPCR. The negative
control samples were collected from 3 healthy individuals.
Protocol for virus-inactivation of patient samples
Before the virus has been inactivated and the outside of the tubes has been disinfected, all work must be carried
out in accordance with the rules of biological safety level 3 [7].
1. Transfer 0.25 mL of the specimen to a clean polypropylene 1.5-2.0 mL Eppendorf tube.
2. Inactivate by heating at 65°C for 30 minutes using a water bath or a thermostated block heater) [8]*.
3. After incubation, add 0.75 mL of 100% isopropanol to obtain a 75% solution and allow the sample to sit
for 10 minutes at room temperature [9].
4. Treat the outer surfaces of the tubes with 70% isopropanol or 1% sodium hypochlorite: spill from a jet
wash and let stand for 15 minutes without getting wet.
After this procedure, the virus can be considered deactivated, and the surface of the tube safe to handle.
Note: * - It is important to note, that during heat treatment, all parts of the tube are heated, so that all of the virus,
even on “inaccessible” surfaces, will be inactivated.
Sample preparation
Protocol 1: «standard proteomics preparation procedure»
Inactivated samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, containing
0.1% Rapigest SF Surfactant (Waters). Reduction was carried out by incubating for 30 minutes at 50°C in 20mM DTT,
followed by alkylation with 50mM iodacetamide for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark, and tryptic digestion
for 4 hours at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by adding formic acid to a final concentration of 0.5%.
Protocol 2: «Express preparation procedure»
Inactivated samples were cooled down to -20°C for 2 hours and centrifuged at 20 000 x g for 20 minutes. The
pellet was resuspended in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, containing 0.1% Rapigest SF Surfactant (Waters) and
subjected to tryptic digestion for 4 hours at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by adding formic acid to a final
concentration of 0.5%.
LC-MS/MS method:
The tryptic peptides were analyzed in duplicate on a nano-HPLC Dionex Ultimate3000 system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA) coupled to a TIMS TOF Pro (Bruker Daltonics, USA) mass-spectrometer. The amount of sample loaded

was 200 ng per injection. HPLC separation (injection volume 2 µL) was carried out using a packed emitter column (C18,
25cm x 75µm 1.6µm) (Ion Optics, Parkville, Australia) [10] by gradient elution. Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in
water; mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. LC separation was achieved at a flow of 400 nL/min using
a 40-min gradient from 4% to 90% of phase B.
Mass spectrometric measurements were carried out using the Parallel Accumulation Serial Fragmentation
(PASEF™) [11] acquisition method. The ESI source settings were the following: 4500 V capillary voltage, 500 V end
plate offset, 3.0 L/min of dry gas at temperature of 180oC. The measurements were carried out over the m/z range
from 100 to 1700 Th. The range of ion mobilities included values from 0.60-1.60 Vs/cm2 (1/k0). The total cycle time
was set at 1.16 sec and the number of PASEF MS/MS scans was set to 10. For low sample amounts, the total cycle time
was set to 1.88 sec.
Data Analysis
The obtained data was analyzed using PEAKS Studio 8.5 and MaxQuant version 1.6.7.0 using the following
parameters: parent mass error tolerance - 20ppm; fragment mass error tolerance - 0.03Da. Due to light denaturation
conditions, the absence of reduction and alkylation steps in one of the sample preparation approaches and short
hydrolysis time - up to 3 missed cleavages were allowed, but only peptides with both trypsin-specific ends were
considered. Oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues were set as possible variable
modifications and up to 3 variable modifications per peptide were allowed. The search was carried out using the
Swissprot SARS-COV-2 database with the human one set as the contamination database. FDR thresholds for all stages
were set to 0.01 (1%) or lower.
RESULTS
Approximately 1000-1500 proteins were identified in each sample, among which the P0DTC9|NCAP_SARS2
Nucleoprotein of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was registered (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Sequence coverage of the P0DTC9|NCAP_SARS2 Nucleoprotein from SARS CoV-2.

Depending on the viral content in the samples, preparation protocol and processing software used 1-17
peptides of the N protein were reliably detected and identified in the COVID-19 patient samples (Tables 1 and 2).
The N protein, being the most abundant protein in the virion, is the best candidate for mass-spectrometric
detection of the infection, and so its detection is expectable. Also MS-based detection of several peptides from the
SARS-COoV-2 nucleoprotein has been reported earlier by the Sinz group [4] in the gargle solution samples of COVID19 patients. We have performed a pilot study on nasopharynx epithelial swabs already collected from patients with
CODIV-19 for RT-qPCR and showed confident identification of the N protein with the use of a very basic sample
preparation procedure.
More than that the express procedure allowed better detection of the N protein than the more thorough one,
standardly used for proteomic analysis. This is probably due to the significantly lower amounts of peptides from the
much more abundant host proteins, which require reduction, alkylation, deglycosylation and other preparative steps
for good sequence coverage.
Also since an untargeted LC-MS/MS with data-dependent acquisition approach was used to identify as many
proteins as possible, it is expected that the use of targeted approaches aimed at monitoring the presence of this exact
protein will result in significantly lower detection limits. For example the use of PRM approaches on triple-quadrupole

mass-spectrometers basing on the peptides identified in this study may allow to go below the sensitivity of RT-qPCR,
while application of immunoprecipitation methods with subsequent MALDI analysis or even MALDI detection of viral
proteins directly on the immobilized antibodies (iMALDI) will allow to shorten the processing times to as low as 1hour.
The observation of over 1000 host proteins also suggests that this approach could be used for detecting and
studying the changes caused by the viral infection in the proteome of host cells, as well as the response of the organism
to these conditions.
