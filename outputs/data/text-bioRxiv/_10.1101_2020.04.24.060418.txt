ABSTRACT
Here, Cas13a has been used to target and mitigate influenza virus A (IAV) and
SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic mRNA-based platform. CRISPR RNAs (crRNA)
against PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 were screened in conjunction with
mRNA-encoded Cas13a.

Screens were designed such that only guides that

decreased influenza RNA levels in a Cas13-mediated fashion, were valid. Cas13a
mRNA and validated guides, delivered post-infection, simulating treatment, were
tested in combination and across multiplicities of infection. Their function was also
characterized over time. Similar screens were performed for guides against SARSCoV-2, yielding multiple guides that significantly impacted cytopathic effect. Last, the
approach was utilized in vivo, demonstrating the ability to degrade influenza RNA in a
mouse model of infection, using polymer-formulated, nebulizer-based mRNA delivery.
Our findings demonstrate the applicability of Cas13a in mitigating respiratory infections
both in vitro and in a mouse model, paving the way for future therapeutic use.

Introduction
There are 219 species of viruses that are known to infect humans

1

of which,

214 are RNA viruses 2. It is estimated that viral infections contribute to approximately
6.6% of global mortality 3. This is especially concerning, given that there are
approximately 90 drugs (since 1963-2016) to treat only 9 viral species 4. In addition,
there are approved vaccines for only 15 viral species. Reassortment, antigenic shift
and drift, for influenza, as well as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) for SARS
and possibly, SARS-CoV-2, pose challenges to vaccine development5 6. These factors
likely contribute to epidemics and pandemics. Human health is thus under constant
threat due to emerging and reemerging viral infections 7. Outbreaks of Zika 8, Ebola 9,
and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic10, and the potential for future influenza
pandemics11, warrant the development of new classes of anti-viral drugs4. Current
drug development is focused on small molecules and neutralizing antibodies, which
require high doses or frequent re-dosing to obtain functional outcomes 12,13. Thus, it is
crucial to address the need for antivirals that are broad spectrum, flexible and effective
across multiple viral species or strains.
The discovery of a RNA targeting, class II - type VI CRISPR-Cas system in
bacteria has engendered tremendous interest for potential applications. The Cas13a:
crRNA complex activates when the target RNA (trRNA) complements with crRNA, and
the Cas protein initiates RNA cleavage14,15, due to the higher eukaryote and
prokaryote nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain

16

. This property has been used to

detect specific transcripts in mixtures of nucleic acids

15

. The specific RNase activity

of Cas13a and Cas13d 17 was also used to knockdown endogenous genes, and more
recently, two groups have demonstrated the ability of Cas13b or Cas13d to degrade
influenza RNA18,19 . In both cases, transient transfection with plasmids or stable cell

lines expressing Cas13 were used prophylactically against influenza RNA. In each
case, Cas13 was expressed at least 24 hrs prior to infection. This prior work was
clearly useful to demonstrate proof of principle.
Here we examined crucial steps towards using this approach as a treatment for
respiratory viral infections. Given the advantages of transient expression for treating
infections, we developed synthetic mRNA to express LbuCas13a both with and without
an NLS sequence, as influenza RNA can be localized to both compartments at
different times post-infection, and both constructs were tested for function within intube assays. Why synthetic mRNA? Synthetic mRNA expression is transient, has very
little chance of integrating, and innate immune responses can be mitigated through
sequence design, modified nucleotides, and purification

. In addition, given

20-22

Cas13a is a bacterial protein, it is possible there may be immune responses to the
protein itself and this is more likely if it is expressed for long periods of time. Transient
expression with minimal innate responses (no adjuvant effect) gives us the highest
probability of repeat dosing in vivo. Thus, this approach may be crucial for repeat
dosing of Cas13a in infected individuals without immune clearance of treated cells due
to Cas13a mediated immune responses.
The mRNA-based approach was initially benchmarked by examining
knockdown of endogenous genes, using previously published target regions10. In
examining these genes, and expanding the number of controls used, it was found that
not all knockdown of RNA was mediated by Cas13a. A number of controls was
needed to ensure that the knockdown was Cas13a mediated, and that enzymatic
action was occurring. Once it was determined which controls were important, guides
against PB1 were screened via qPCR, given post-infection, simulating a treatment
strategy. Why polymerase genes? They are more highly conserved, and without

polymerase protein neither viral mRNA nor replication can occur 10,23,24. A potent guide
against PB1 mRNA was found using this approach but guides with broader sequence
homology across flu strains were sought. By first examining homology among 108
vaccine strains, a stretch of nucleotides in PB2 were found to overlap most H1N1
strains, the H1N1 pandemic strain from 2009, and H3N2 strains used in prior vaccines.
Vaccine strains are a benchmark for circulating strain variation over time and thus
good candidates. At least two potent guides against this sequence were found.
Subsequent tests post-infection included combining guides, and time-course studies
yielding potent knockdown of influenza RNA. We then asked whether this same
approach could be used against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the current pandemic.
Here, we delivered the mRNA prophylactically, as the virus is especially potent in
VeroE6 cells, and cytopathic effect (CPE) was used as the metric for success. Here
we demonstrate clear mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 CPE.
Last, we demonstrated that this approach has translational potential by
delivering Cas13 mRNA and guides formulated with a PBAE-based polymer
nebulizer post-influenza infection, simulating treatment.

via

At day 3 post infection,

degradation of influenza RNA in the lung was evaluated demonstrating robust
knockdown. Overall, we feel that we have demonstrated the necessity of controls for
designing crRNAs, the possibility of pan-influenza targeting of viral strains, and the
ability to target relevant and emergent respiratory pathogens, both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
mRNA expressed Cas13a cleaves RNA in the presence of both crRNA and target
RNA
Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS (version with
nuclear localization sequence) mRNAs were translated in vitro and used to assess the
RNA cleavage activity of the expressed Cas13a protein in conjunction with IAV
crRNAs and target RNAs (trRNAs) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). A variant
including an NLS sequence was included for testing because influenza virus replicates
in the nucleus. crRNA and trRNA were derived from a genome segment of IAV.
RNaseAlert™ substrate fluorescence was the output of RNA cleavage. Cas13a and
Cas13a-NLS RNA cleavage generated fluorescence increased to its maximum during
the initial 10- and 20-min period, respectively, and then gradually decreased over time,
likely due to photobleaching. The overall trend of RNA cleavage was similar for both
the Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS (Fig. 1b). Our results indicate that in vitro translated
Cas13a mediated RNA cleavage is specific and occurred only when both the crRNA
and trRNA were present. In addition, when a non-target crRNA (NTCR) was used
along with the trRNA, no RNA cleavage was observed, thus demonstrating crRNAspecific cleavage of trRNA by Cas13a (Fig, 1b). Overall, the mRNAs designed
express functional Cas13 proteins.

Endogenous gene knockdown via mRNA-based Cas13 expression
In order to more fully validate the mRNA-based approach, mRNA expressing
LbuCas13a, with and without an NLS, and guides targeting PPIB, CXCR4 and KRAS
endogenous genes were tested, and gene knockdown evaluated at 24 hours via qPCR
(Fig. 2a-c and Supplementary Table 2). Initially, the knockdown relative to the non6

targeted control RNA (NTCR) was evaluated, but the effects of transfection, etc., on
gene expression were not being assessed. To date, most studies only evaluate
targeted reduction of RNA relative to the reduction due to a NTCR. Two additional
controls were added, a mRNA expressing a “dead” or inactive Cas13a plus targeted
guide, and a GFP encoding mRNA plus targeted guide. Each control yielded valuable
information regarding how the guide was performing. The dead version gives insight
into whether “binding-only” events may affect RNA levels, while the GFP control adds
additional information regarding whether the guide alone has knockdown effects. If all
the controls do not affect RNA levels and knockdown is only due to the active enzyme,
then enzymatic action is driving the reduction. There are cases where the Cas13a
inactive version may also decrease RNA levels (Fig. 2 b). This is not necessarily a
problem per se, but this control group helps distinguish “binding” related knockdown
from enzymatic effects. All this information is important for establishing the mode of
action of this therapeutic approach.
For PPIB, the controls in general acted as expected, though there was some
effect of the NTCR in the NLS case. The PPIB guides exhibited 57% and 53%
knockdown via the cytosolic and NLS versions of LbuCas13a in 24 hrs, respectively
(Fig. 2a). For CXCR4, unfortunately, the guides themselves, using published spacer
sequences, without Cas13a expression, significantly knocked down the mRNA by over
90% (Fig. 2b). For KRAS, this did not occur, and instead the guides exhibited Cas13
mediated knockdown, 38% and 60%, via the cytosolic and NLS versions of
LbuCas13a in 24 hrs, respectively (Fig. 2c). The data resulting from the CXCR4
experiments were surprising, but clearly demonstrated the need for the additional
controls when screening guides against specific RNAs to ensure Cas13 mediated
knockdown.

Screening of crRNAs targeting PB1 post-infection
Next, six PB1 guides targeting both the genome and mRNA were designed and
screened post-infection (Supplementary Table 2).

Here, A549 cells were first

infected with influenza A/WSN/33 at a MOI of 0.01; 24 hours post-infection, mRNA
and guides were delivered, and at 48 hrs post-infection, PB1 RNA levels were
evaluated

qPCR.

(WSN33_PB1_m5) exhibited very strong knockdown, approximately 83% using the
cytosolic Cas13a and 78% via the NLS version, during the 24 hr period (Fig. 3a,
Supplementary Fig.1). None of the controls demonstrated “guide-only” effects (Fig.
3b, c and Supplementary Fig.1) and even the dead version showed minimal
knockdown, demonstrating that the effects were likely only from enzymatic action.

Expanding the breath of guides against influenza: targeting PB2.
Clearly, for this approach to have high therapeutic value, the ability to target
many strains of a given virus is advantageous. For influenza, a bioinformatic
comparison of 108 influenza historical vaccine strains and candidate vaccine strains,
with publicly available genome sequences, yielded a number of conserved regions
across different subsets of strains (Fig. 4). We specifically focused on our so-called
“Human” subset, which included human seasonal H1N1, H1N1pdm09, and human
seasonal H3N2 strains. From this analysis, a conserved region in PB2 was found,
and six guides were designed against both viral mRNA and the genome of influenza
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). From this exercise, three guides where found to
knockdown the viral RNA >50%, delivered 24 hrs post-infection and evaluated at 48
hrs post-infection, with varying effectiveness in the nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig 2). Guides WSN33_PB2_m4 and WSN33_PB2_g2 both

exhibited over 75% knockdown at the RNA level (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 2)
These two guides were examined for breadth, and when the combination was
compared with over 52,000 strains downloaded from , over the last 100 years, they
were exact matches with 99.1% of strains (Fig. 4 e,f). This result was very encouraging
towards the goal of a pan-influenza approach.

Screening of crRNAs targeting PB2 post-infection and in combination with a
PB1 guide
The mRNA targeted guides for PB1 and PB2 were then combined with both
cytoplasmic and NLS targeted Cas13a and the combination was evaluated both as a
function of MOI and over-time (Fig. 6). The use of the combination NLS and
cytoplasmic Cas13a is justified by the variability of the distribution of viral RNPs from
cell to cell (Supplementary Fig 3). First, when the combination was evaluated, in our
standard screening assay, we clearly saw the benefits of the combination, yielding
~10% lower RNA values than with WSN33_PB1_m5 alone. When this combination
was examined across MOI, it was clear that at MOI=0.001 and 0.01, > than 80%
knockdown was achievable, where at MOI=0.1, the effect was only ~25% (Fig 6. a-b).
The effect though, may be increased if the enzymatic reaction is given more time, and
if the dose of mRNA and guide is increased. When the combination was evaluated
over time, at MOI=0.01, the results demonstrated continued RNA reduction over a
span of 72 hours (Fig 6. c-d), with the peak difference from IAV and the NTCR at 48
hours. It should be noted that we did see increased effects of the NTCR over time,
likely due to low levels of NTCR overlap with native genes inducing activation.
However, if the effect of the treatment or “drug”, Cas13a mRNA+targeted guide, is

compared with the IAV only case, the approach was able to sustain 90% knockdown
over the 3-day period.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in a Vero E6 model of infection.
Given the current importance of SARS-CoV-2, a set of crRNAs that target highly
conserved regions in the replicase and nucleocapsid regions of the genome were
designed (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2, 3 and 4). The nucleocapsid sites
would also allow for the targeting of any of the subgenomic RNAs produced by the
virus. In this experiment, 9 different guides were screened, by first transfecting Vero
E6 cells overnight with the cytoplasmic version of Cas13a and guides, and then
infecting with MOI=~0.1 of SARS-CoV-2. Note, only the cytoplasmic version was
used, because the virus replicates in this cell compartment

26

. Prophylactic delivery

was used because this virus exhibits very rapid kinetics in Vero E6 cells, as well as
the fact that they are interferon deficient.

In less permissive, less cytopathic

susceptible cell types, we anticipate the post-infection approach to yield similar results
to the influenza experiments. At 1-hour PI, an Avicel overlay was added to the wells
and CPE was evaluated at 60 hrs PI. From this screen, guides N3.2 (nucleocapsid),
N3.1 (nucleocapsid), R5.1 (replicase), and N11.2 (nucleocapsid) were found to have
an impact on cytopathic effect (CPE), with guide 3.2 (Fig. 7) exhibiting the lowest CPE.
This was repeated in 6 well plates using both individual and combinations of guides
including all the controls, and the data quantified by image analysis, demonstrating for
the combination of N3.2 and N11.2 over 72% reduction in cell death with over 80% of
cells remaining in the plate. Overall, this bodes well for use as a therapeutic for SARSCoV-2.

Reduction of IAV in vivo post-infection

In order to test this approach in vivo, we first had to develop both an apparatus
and formulation for the RNA for nebulizer-based delivery.

We designed a

straightforward nose-cone nebulizer apparatus (Fig. 8a), which allows for 3 mice to be
dosed simultaneously from a vibrating mesh nebulizer. PBAE was chosen for our
formulation based on prior publication and lung delivery25. First, the final concentration
of mRNA in the formulation was optimized using a GPI-anchored nanoluciferase
(aNLuc) encoding mRNA in the lung (Fig. 8b), yielding optimal expression in the lungs
at 0.5 µg/ml, as reported previously. Next, we determined whether influenza infection
affects delivery. We infected mice with 3 LD50 of Influenza A/WSN/33 and then
delivered aNLuc mRNA at 12 and 24 hrs post-infection as well as without infection
(Fig. 8c-d). No significant differences in expression were observed, demonstrating
efficient mRNA delivery and protein expression via nebulizer in the face of influenza
infection.
In order to test this treatment approach, mice were infected with 3 LD50 of
Influenza A/WSN/33 (Fig. 8e) via intranasal administration. Six-eight hours postinfection, one group was given, by nose cone nebulizer, 100 µg of mRNA encoding
Cas13a (with and without NLS) and guide (WSN/33_PB1_m5) formulated with the
PBAE-based polymer. Control groups included mice given 100 µg of Cas13a mRNA
with an NTCR guide as well as an infection only group. At 3 days post-infection the
animals were euthanized, and the viral RNA in their lungs was quantified by qPCR.
Analysis revealed a 89.1% (p=0.0097) reduction of viral RNA from NTCR and a 96.2%
(p=0.0001) from IAV only, demonstrating robust knockdown of viral RNA in vivo.

DISCUSSION
RNA viruses pose challenges for drug and vaccine development and thus are
a global health concern. Unconventional molecular tools like RNA-activated RNases,
such as Cas13a, could be a potential new paradigm for therapeutics against these
pathogens. However, for the RNA targeting RNases to be safe and effective for
therapeutic use, rapid, transient expression is preferred 27. To achieve this, we opted
for synthetic in vitro transcribed mRNA to express Cas13a. mRNA has the advantage
of rapid translation of the desired protein and clearance, while it avoids safety
concerns

responses20,21,28-30.

Using this all RNA-based approach, we found crRNA guides that
targeted both the genome and the mRNA of influenza effectively, even when given 24
hours post-infection. To date, this is the first demonstration that this approach can be
used post-infection. There was, though, a clear bias towards mRNA targeted guides,
which is consistent with prior work using siRNA against influenza31. In addition, even
though we were not able to find guides that were truly pan-influenza, they clearly
overlap with over 52,000 strains, making significant strides towards this goal. Prior
studies had not targeted polymerase genes. It is our contention that they are excellent
targets due to their clear role in generating viral RNA and the fact they are so well
conserved. We also demonstrated for the first time, how this approach scales with MOI
and is functional over a 3-day period even when using transient transfection of mRNA.
The time course data demonstrated the ability of Cas13a to degrade RNA at a rate
equal to or more rapidly than the rate of RNA generation from viral replication. This
has not been addressed to date. The data clearly shows that over the 3-day period

post-delivery, that Cas13a was keeping RNA levels consistently ~1 log lower than
without the treatment. In the future, we will address how dose effects these dynamics
and how this may change with Cas13b or d.

We then addressed the question; can this approach be rapidly applied directly
to newly emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2? From our results, it is clear that
Cas13a can have significant effects on CPE, a well-established measure of antiviral
activity32. These results clearly demonstrate the adaptability of this approach and its
flexibility. Different guide sequences are sufficient to target either IAV or SARS-CoV2. By delivering the nuclear or the cytoplasmic versions of Cas13, or both together,
the replication and dynamics of different viruses can be significantly impacted. Given
the promising results in vitro for SARS-CoV-2, this approach will be moved into animal
models in the very near future. Due to the need for ABSL3, and the fact that the animal
models are not yet mature, we did not pursue these experiments at this juncture.

Last, we answered a critical question regarding Cas13, can it be used in vivo?
Here we formulated the mRNA with PBAE-based polymer previously demonstrated by
the Anderson lab25 and delivered it post-infection using a vibrating-mesh style
nebulizer that is currently used by humans, simulating a treatment strategy, and
demonstrated that Cas13 can degrade viral RNA in vivo efficiently. This is the first
demonstration of Cas13 use in an animal model of infection and it bodes well for
treating other infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. Given we have guides that were
effective in vitro, we have confidence that we can move this to an appropriate animal
model such as ferrets or hamsters.

This will be a very important step towards

developing a Cas13 based treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Future work will

include these vital steps in addition to further development of mRNA carriers for the
lung. Overall, this work demonstrates significant progress toward the use of this of
Cas13 to treat respiratory viral infections.

METHODS
Design and synthesis of Cas13a constructs and anchored nanoluciferase mRNA
The Cas13a sequence from Leptotrichia buccalis was obtained from Addgene
p2CT-His-MBP-Lbu_C2C2_WT (Plasmid #83482). We cloned the wild type Cas13a
with a 3’ V5 tag (Cas13a-V5) and appended a 3’ UTR from mouse alpha-globin
(Genbank accession # NM_001083955) in a pMA7 vector (GeneArt, Thermo
Scientific, USA). Additionally, we synthesized a construct with the Cas13a sequence
from the Leptotrichia buccalis along with a nuclear localization sequence (at 3’ and 5’)
and a 3’ V5 tag to create a Cas13a-V5-NLS version using GeneBlocks (Integrated
DNA technologies). For both constructs, we synthesized catalytically-inactive versions
(dCas13a – V5 and dCas13a-V5-NLS). The sequences were obtained by Addgene
plasmid#100817. The sequences of the GPI anchor and nanoluciferase are described
in Lindsay et al33.

In vitro transcription of Cas13a
Plasmids were linearized with Not-I HF (New England Biolabs) overnight at
37°C. Linearized templates were purified by sodium acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
precipitation and rehydrated with nuclease free water. IVT was performed overnight at
37°C using the HiScribe T7 kit (NEB) following the manufacturer’s instructions (N1methyl-pseudouridine modified). The resulting RNA was treated with DNase I

(Aldevron) for 30 min to remove the template, and it was purified using lithium chloride
precipitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA was heat denatured at 65°C for 10
minutes before capping with a Cap-1 structure using guanylyl transferase and 2’-Omethyltransferase (Aldevron). mRNA was then purified by lithium chloride
precipitation, treated with alkaline phosphatase (NEB) and purified again. mRNA
concentration was measured using a Nanodrop. mRNA stock concentrations were 13 mg/ml. Purified mRNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to ensure
purity. crRNA guides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) or
Genscript. The sequences are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

RNA cleavage activity of in vitro translated of Cas13a
In order to demonstrate that mRNA-expressed Cas13a efficiently encodes for
a fully functional enzyme able to cleave a target RNA in a “in tube” assay, Cas13a
mRNA was translated in vitro using the Rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, WI, USA). RNaseAlert®-1 Substrate was
mixed with crRNA or NTCR (500 nM) and trRNA (500 nM) in RNA processing buffer,
consisting of A549 cells RNA (100 ng), 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.8), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, BSA (10 µg/ml), yeast tRNA (10 µg/ml), 0.01% Igepal CA-630 and 5% glycerol
(Supplementary Table 1)15. This mixture was added cold to the translated Cas13a
lysate (5 µl) in the 96-well plate wells and mixed well. All the reagent preparations and
additions were performed on ice. The fluorescence measurements (excitation 485±20
nm/emission 528 ± 20 nm) were recorded at room temperature for 90 min at 10 min
interval.

All cell lines and viruses were purchased from American Type culture collection
(ATCC. Manassas, VA). Human lung epithelial cells A549 (CCL185), MDCK, Vero E6
were grown in media recommended by ATCC. Guide screening experiments for IAV
were performed in A549 cells. Guide screening experiments for SARS-CoV-2 were
performed in Vero E6 cells. Influenza virus stocks (H1N1 Influenza virus A/WSN/33)
were prepared in MDCK cells. Briefly, MDCK cells were grown till 100% confluence in
175 mm2. The next day, cells were washed twice with PBS and 1:1000 dilution of virus
was added in 5 ml EMEM. Cells were then incubated with the virus for 1h at room
temperature on a rocker. Then, 25 ml media was added to the cells. Cells were
monitored for 72 h or until a severe cytopathic effect was observed. Virus was collected
by centrifuging the cells at 1000xg for 10 min. Virus titers were determined by standard
plaque assay.
SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas,
VA). Viral stocks were generated by infecting Vero E6 cells (ATCC, C1008) at ~95%
confluency in 150cm2 flasks with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. At 68 hours
post-infection, supernatants were collected, pooled, and centrifuged at 400xg for 10
minutes. The resulting stock was aliquoted, titered, and stored at -80oC for further use.
All work with live SARS-CoV-2 was performed inside a certified Class II Biosafety
Cabinet in a BSL3 laboratory in compliance with all State and Federal guidelines and
with the approval of the UGA Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).

A549 cells were seeded overnight at a density of 120,000-130,000 per well in
a 24 well plate. The following day, cells were transfected with mRNA encoding for
Cas13a and either targeted crRNA or non-targeted crRNA guides (NTCR) using
Lipofectamine Messenger Max (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer
instructions. dCas13 constructs-encoding mRNAs and GFP-encoding mRNA were
also used as controls to assess the effect of Cas13a targeted binding and mRNA
transfection/guides alone, respectively, on gene expression. For each well, 0.5 µg
mRNA and 1.5ul Messenger Max were used. crRNA guides and NTCR were added to
the transfection mix at 20x molar guide:mRNA ratio in all endogenous gene
knockdown experiments (PPIB, CXCR4, KRAS). The sequences of the previously
published crRNA guides10 are detailed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.
24h post transfection, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus mini kit.
cDNA was prepared using the High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (The
Applied Biosystems™, Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR experiments were performed
using the FastAdvanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cas13-mediated
degradation of PPIB, CXCR4 and KRAS mRNA was assayed by qPCR with the ΔΔCT
method (n=3) using GAPDH as control. Experiments were performed using a
QuantStudio7 Flex thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). All primer/probe assays for
endogenous gene experiments were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
(Supplementary Table 5).

adding 100ul of Influenza virus diluted in serum-free media with TPCK for 1h. The cells
were then washed with 1xPBS and complete media with TPCK was added for 24h.
Cells were then transfected with mRNA encoding for Cas13a and either targeted
crRNA or non-targeted crRNA guides (NTCR) using Lipofectamine Messenger Max
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. dCas13 constructsencoding mRNAs and GFP-encoding mRNA were also used as controls to assess the
effect of Cas13a targeted binding and mRNA transfection/guides alone, respectively,
on gene expression. For each well, 0.5 µg mRNA and 1.5ul Messenger Max were
used. crRNA guides and NTCR were added to the transfection mix at 50x molar
guide:mRNA ratio in all IVA-based experiments. The sequences of the crRNA guides
are detailed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.
24h post transfection, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus mini kit.
cDNA was prepared using the High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (The
Applied Biosystems™, Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR experiments were performed
using the FastAdvanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The anti-viral activity
of Cas13a system was measured by qPCR (n=6) with the absolute quantification of
the viral PB1 or PB2 gene copy number. Experiments were performed using a
QuantStudio7 Flex thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems).
In the “combo experiments”, for each well, 0.25 µg of each mRNA Cas13a – V5
and Cas13a-V5-NLS and 1.5ul Messenger Max were used. Each crRNA guides was
added to the transfection mix at 25x molar guide:mRNA ratio. The sequences of the
primer/probe assays for PB1 and PB2 for H1N1 Influenza virus A/WSN/33 are listed

In vitro anti-viral assay with SARS-CoV-2
Vero cells were seeded overnight at ~80% confluency in a 6 well plate. The
following day, cells were transfected with mRNA encoding for Cas13a-V5 and either
targeted crRNA or non-targeted crRNA guides (NTCR) using Lipofectamine
Messenger Max (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. For
each well, 5 µg mRNA and 7.5ul Messenger Max were used. crRNA guides and NTCR
were added to the transfection mix at 50x molar guide:mRNA ratio (Supplementary
Tables 2 and 3). In the “combo experiments”, for each well, 5 µg of Cas13a – V5 and
7.5ul Messenger Max were used. Each crRNA guide was added to the transfection
mix to maintain the 50x molar guide:mRNA ratio. After an overnight incubation at 37
°C, 5% CO2, plates were transferred to the BSL3 for infection. The medium was
removed, and cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 45-60 minutes at an MOI of
~0.1 PFU/cell. After infection, cells were overlayed with 1x DMEM 1%FBS containing
1.2% Avicel RC-581 and incubated for 72 hours. The overlay was removed, cells
rinsed with 1x PBS, and fixed/stained with a crystal violet solution containing 2%
methanol, 4% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. Images for presentation were white
balanced and intensities for analysis were not modified for calculations. All images
were brought into photoshop, converted to grayscale, and color inverted. An ROI of
the same size was then used for all images and the sum intensity was calculated by
Volocity. Intensities were normalized to a blank region of each image in order to
account for image to image variation. Signal was then normalized to the Mock
condition to give a percent live cell area.

Six- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories) were
maintained under pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated and watered
cages kept at negative pressure. Food was provided to mice ad libitum. Animals were
acclimatized for at least 6 days before the beginning of experiments. Animals were
randomly distributed among experimental groups. Researchers were blinded to animal
group allocation during data acquisition. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation.
Infected animals were handled and kept under BSL-2 conditions until euthanized. All
animals were cared for according to the Georgia Institute of Technology Physiological
Research Laboratory policies and under ethical guidance from the university’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) following National institutes of
Health (NIH) guidelines.

Nebulizer-based mRNA deliveries
Mice were loaded into a custom-built nose-only exposure system constructed
of a clear PVC tee and animal restraints (CODA Small Mouse Holder, Kent Scientific).
These were connected using a custom 3D-printed nosecone (3D Printing Tech) made
of a flexible TPU material. The nebulizer (Aeroneb, Kent Scientific) was then placed
on the upward facing port of the tee. Doses were added dropwise to the nebulizer at
a rate of 25 µL/mouse/droplet. After each individual droplet was nebulized, the clear
tee was inspected until the vaporized dose had cleared (approximately 15-45 seconds
per drop). Droplets were added until the desired dose per animal was achieved. After
the vapor had cleared following the last droplet, the mice were removed from the
restraints.

mRNA was formulated for nebulizer-based delivery using a hyperbranched
PBAE as previously described25 with minor modifications. Diacrylate and amine
monomers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To synthesize hyperbranched
hDD90-118, acrylate: backbone amine: trifunctional amine monomers were reacted
modifying the ratio at 1: 0.59: 0.40. Monomers were stirred in anhydrous
dimethylformamide at a concentration of 150 mg/mL at 40 °C for 4 h then 90 °C for 48
h. The mixtures were allowed to cool to 30 °C and end cap amine was added at 1.0
molar equivalent relative to the acrylate and stirred for a further 24 h. The polymers
were purified by dropwise precipitation into cold anhydrous diethyl ether spiked with
glacial acetic acid, vortexed and centrifuged at 1250 xg for 2 min. The supernatant
was discarded, and the polymer washed twice more in fresh diethyl ether and dried
under vacuum for 48 h. This step was repeated until the supernatant in the
precipitation process became transparent. Polymers were stored at −20 °C.
Before delivery to mice, 100 mM of sodium acetate pH 5.0 was used to both
solubilize the hyperbranched PBAE and dilute mRNA prior to mixing. The final
concentration of the mRNA was 0.5 mg/mL, and the PBAE was used at a 50x molar
ratio to the mRNA. The tubes were incubated at RT for 10 minutes, and the particles
were loaded into the nebulizer as described above.
Following euthanasia, whole lungs were collected and rinsed with PBS. Lungs
were then placed into a solution of Nano-Glo substrate solution (Promega) diluted 50fold in PBS. Lungs were incubated for 5 minutes and then placed onto black paper
and imaged with an IVIS Spectrum CT (Perkin Elmer). Lung luminescence was then
quantified using Living Image software (Perkin Elmer).

Viral load quantification from lung tissues
Mice were infected intranasally with 3 LD50 influenza virus using 20 µL per
nostril following brief anaesthesia by isoflurane. Virus was diluted in DMEM without
modifications to the desired PFU dose. After euthanasia, lungs were harvested into
PBS prior to downstream assays.
Lungs were dissociated as described previously29 . Briefly, lungs were weighed
before dissociation using a GentleMACS in a C Tube using the lung 2 setting (Miltenyi).
After centrifugation at RT for 5 minutes at 500 xg, pellets were lysed in RLT plus buffer
(Qiagen) and further homogenized using NAVY tubes in a Bullet Blender (Next
Advance). Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and maximum speed to clarify
the supernatant. Total RNA was then extracted following a RNeasy Plus Mini kit
(Qiagen) per manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis and qPCR were then
performed as detailed above with the absolute quantification of the viral PB1 gene
copy number.

Statistical Analyses
All experiments are represented as a mean of three or six biological replicates
as indicated. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.04. Statistical analyses
were performed between groups using either ordinary one-way or two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) as specified in individual figure captions.
