Abstract
The rapidly developing COVID-19 pandemic has raised a concern that cancer patients
may have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This discussion has mostly
focused on therapy-induced immune suppression. Here, we examined the expression
patterns of ACE2, the receptor through which SARX-CoV2 enters human cells, and
found that ACE2 mRNA levels are elevated in tumor-adjacent normal tissues of cancer
patients, including in normal-adjacent lung tissues of lung cancer patients. These
observations raise the possibility that the elevated COVID-19 risk of cancer patients
may not be limited to those undergoing immune-suppressing treatment.
