Abstract

35

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, and the number

36

of cases continues to rise all over the world. Besides humans, the zoonotic origin, as well as

37

intermediate and potential spillback host reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. To circumvent ethical

38

and experimental constraints, and more importantly, to reduce and refine animal experimentation, we

39

employed our airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture repository composed of various domesticated and

40

wildlife animal species to assess their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we inoculated well-

41

differentiated animal AEC cultures of monkey, cat, ferret, dog, rabbit, pig, cattle, goat, llama, camel,

42

and two neotropical bat species with SARS-CoV-2. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 only replicated

43

efficiently in monkey and cat AEC culture models. Whole-genome sequencing of progeny virus

44

revealed no obvious signs of nucleotide transitions required for SARS-CoV-2 to productively infect

45

monkey and cat epithelial airway cells. Our findings, together with the previously reported human-to-

46

animal spillover events warrants close surveillance to understand the potential role of cats, monkeys,

47

and closely related species as spillback reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

49

During the last two decades we have observed zoonotic outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory

50

Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-

51

CoV) in 2012

52

emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 3,4. Although

53

humans are currently seen as the main hosts, the zoonotic origin, as well as the intermediate and

54

potential spillback host reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Interestingly, several reports indicate

55

that SARS-CoV-2 spillover events from human to other animal species can occur 5–9. These events are

56

likely driven by close human-animal interactions and the conservation of crucial receptor binding motif

57

(RBM) residues in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologues, potentially facilitating

58

SARS-CoV-2 entry 10,11. This highlights the need to assess the potential host spectrum for SARS-CoV-2

59

in order to support current pandemic mitigation strategies.

. These outbreaks are followed by the current pandemic which caused by zoonotic

1,2

60

Besides risk assessment of the host spectrum, viral pathogenesis studies, as well as all novel

61

antiviral drugs, immunotherapies, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, will require evaluation in animal

62

models. Therefore, a large variety of animal species are tested on their susceptibility 12–14. Traditionally

63

such experiments have several drawbacks in terms of animal model diversity and availability, including

64

dedicated personnel, housing facilities, and most importantly, ethical approval. Some of these factors

65

are especially limited in the context of wildlife, and livestock animals, such as pig, cattle and other

66

ruminants, and in case of companion animals and non-human primates there are additional

67

socioemotional ethical constraints to be overcome.

68

In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of several mammalian species to SARS-CoV-2 by

69

recapitulating the initial stages of infection in a controlled in vitro model, in compliance with the

70

reduction, refinement and replacement principles in animal experimentation, whilst at the same time

71

circumventing traditional in vivo experimental constraints. We employed a unique well-differentiated

72

airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture repository from primary tracheobronchial airway tissue of 12

73

mammalian species comprising companion animals, animal model candidates, livestock, and wild

74

animals to assess their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to control for the quality of the

75

AEC, we used influenza viruses that have a known broad host tropism 15–17.

Results

77

The main goal of our study is to evaluate the susceptibility of a diverse set of animal species to SARS-

78

CoV-2 infection. We employed well-differentiated AEC cultures reconstituted from tracheobronchial

79

epithelial tissue, thereby replacing animal experimentation. In total, we obtained post-mortem

80

tracheobronchial airway tissue material from animal species, comprising companion animals (cat,

81

dog), commonly used animal models (rhesus macaque, ferret, and rabbit), livestock (pig, cattle, goat,

82

camel, and llama), and two neotropical frugivorous bat species (Sturnira lilium and Carollia

83

perspicillata). Following isolation of primary airway epithelial cells, well-differentiated AEC cultures

84

were established and maintained as performed previously for human AEC cultures, with individual

85

modifications for each species (Table. 1) 18. After 4 to 6 weeks of differentiation we inoculated each

86

culture with 30.000 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2/München-1.1/2020/929 isolate, representing the current

87

circulating SpikeD614G variant 19. Viral progeny release was monitored by quantifying the viral titer and

88

viral RNA in the apical washes that were collected every 24 hours for a duration of 96 hours. Since we

89

previously observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiency in the human respiratory tract is influenced

90

by the ambient temperature, the infection was carried out at either 33°C or 37°C 20.

91

The quantification of the viral RNA load at both temperatures showed that there was a

92

progressive 4-log fold increase in viral RNA load at 72- and 96-hours post-infection (hpi) in rhesus

93

macaque and cat AEC cultures. In contrast, for the remaining animal AEC cultures either a continuous

94

or declining level of viral RNA load was detected throughout the entire time course (Fig. 1a and b, Fig.

95

S1b and c). Because molecular assays do not discern between infectious and non-infectious virus, we

96

also performed viral titration assays with the corresponding apical washes 21. This corroborated our

97

previous findings, namely that only AEC cultures derived from rhesus macaque and cat displayed a

98

progressive increase in viral SARS-CoV-2 titers over time, while for the majority of species no infectious

99

virus was detected beyond 24 hpi (Fig. 1c and d, Fig. S1d and e). The viral titers observed in the rhesus

100

macaque and cat AEC cultures are comparable to those that we previously observed for human AEC

101

cultures, where we also observed a 4-log fold rise of progeny released virus in the apical side

102

Interestingly, although ferrets have previously been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, we

103

observed no viral replication in AEC cultures derived from the tracheobronchial regions. Instead, only

104

low levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral titers at 72 and 96 hpi were detected at 37°C, in agreement with in vivo

105

studies in ferrets showing a dose-dependent and limited SARS-CoV-2 infection restricted to the upper

106

respiratory tract 22–24. We further analysed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the animal AEC cultures by staining

107

for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein on formalin-fixed AEC cultures, to visualize intracellular presence

108

of the virus. This revealed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive cells were detected in rhesus macaque

109

and cat AEC cultures at 96 hpi, while in the other animal AEC cultures, including those of ferrets, no

110

SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive cells were observed (Fig. 2, Fig. S1a). This further confirmed that amongst

111

animals studied, only monkey and cat airway epithelial cells support efficient replication of SARS-CoV-

112

2.

113

The absence of infectious progeny virus in most animal species, except rhesus macaques and

114

cats, indicates that certain animal species may be intrinsically refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

115

which may be due to incompatibility with the cellular receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry

116

25,26

117

sequence conservation of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in ACE2 we performed in silico analysis on

118

the available ACE2 protein sequences 25,27. The ACE2 protein sequences from the two neotropical bat

119

species (S. lilium and C. perspicillata) were not included in the analysis, due to their unavailability.

120

Similarly, the ACE2 protein sequence for llama is not available, and therefore we used the sequence of

121

alpaca (XM_006212647.3) as an alternative, as it is the closest relative. This revealed that in

122

comparison to humans, the ACE2 RBM regions interacting with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of

123

SARS-CoV-2 are well conserved in rhesus macaques and cats while being slightly more diverse in other

124

species (Fig. S2a).

. To assess whether the observed susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to the amino acid

125

Apart from receptor compatibility as a limiting factor of virus infection, it has been

126

demonstrated previously that partially differentiated AEC cultures are poorly permissive to respiratory

127

virus infection 28. To investigate whether the lack of replication in for instance the ferret cells, was not

128

caused by poor differentiation of our cell cultures, we validated the AEC cultures by performing

129

infections with the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (A/Hamburg/4/2009, IAV) and the ruminant-

130

associated influenza D virus ((D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013, IDV). Both viruses are members of

131

Orthomyxoviridae and are known to have a broad host spectrum, including ferrets

132

cultures from 12 different species (rhesus macaque, cat, ferret, dog, rabbit, pig, cattle, goat, llama,

133

camel, and two neotropical bats) were inoculated with 10.000 TCID50 of either IAV or IDV and incubated

134

at 33°C and 37°C. After 48 hours, the AEC cultures were fixed and processed by immunofluorescence

135

assays. This analysis showed that, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2, IAV antigen-positive cells could be

136

detected in both companion animals AEC cultures, as well as in the commonly used animal models,

137

such as ferret, monkey, rabbit, and porcine AEC cultures (Fig. 2, Fig. S1a) 30. For IDV we observed

138

antigen-positive cells in all AEC model, except for rhesus macaque and one of the neotropical bat

139

species, indicating that the AEC cultures were all well-differentiated and susceptible to virus infection.

140

In the immunofluorescence analysis we also incorporated an antibody against beta-tubulin

141

marker to discern ciliated and non-ciliated cell populations. For both rhesus macaques and cats, SARS-

142

CoV-2 antigen-positive cells predominantly overlapped with the non-ciliated cell populations,

143

irrespective of the incubation temperature. Using a polyclonal antibody against the human ACE2 we

144

could observe that the cellular receptor expression in rhesus macaques predominantly overlaps with

145

SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism, indicating same cellular tropism (Fig. S2b). Unfortunately, the polyclonal

146

antibody against the human ACE2 did not bind the feline ACE2 protein, we could therefore not formally

147

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected cat cells are indeed expressing ACE2 on their surface.

148
149

Whole-genome sequence analysis

150

It has previously been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can undergo rapid genetic changes in vitro 31. Since we

151

observed efficient replication in rhesus macaque and cat AEC cultures, therefore we assessed whether

152

any mutations suggestive of viral adaptation had occurred. We performed whole-genome sequencing

153

(Nanopore sequencing technology) on the viral inoculum used as well as the progeny viruses collected

154

after one passage, at 96 hpi from the rhesus macaque and cat AEC cultures incubated at 33°C and 37°C.

155

This inoculum was either passage 1 or passage 2 virus stocks from the SARS-CoV-2/München-

156

1.1/2020/929 isolate we had received. In the viral sequences in the 96 hpi samples from virus-infected

157

rhesus macaque and cat AEC cultures, we observed no obvious signs of nucleotide transitions that lead

158

to nonsynonymous mutations compared to the respective inoculums (Fig. 3), irrespective of

159

temperature and animal species. This highlights that the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 D614G-

160

variant can productively infect rhesus macaque and cat airway epithelial cells.

161

Discussion

162

This is the first study employing an in vitro AEC culture repository composed of various domestic and

163

wildlife animal species to assess the potential intermediate and spillback host reservoir spectrum of

164

SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation of AEC cultures of rhesus macaque, cat, ferret, dog, rabbit, pig, cattle, goat,

165

llama, camel, and two neotropical bat species with SARS-CoV-2 revealed that only tracheobronchial

166

cells from rhesus macaque and cats supported efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2. Whole-genome

167

sequencing indicated that the current circulating SARS-CoV-2 D614G-variant can efficiently infect

168

rhesus macaque and cat airway epithelial cells. Our data highlight that these two animals are potential

169

models for the evaluation of therapeutic mitigation strategies for currently circulating viral variants. In

170

conjunction with the previous documented spillover events, close surveillance of these animals,

171

including closely related species, in the wild, captivity, and household situations is warranted.

172

To date, there have been several published reports evaluating the suitability of animal models

173

towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, including cats, rhesus macaques, dogs, pigs, and ferrets

174

Interestingly, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 does not efficiently replicate in our tracheobronchial

175

airway epithelial cells derived from ferrets, whereas ferrets are used as animal models. This may be

176

due to viral infections in ferrets are mainly restricted to the nasal conchae and are dose-dependent,

177

and additionally, the origin of the cells used as input for the AEC may not recapitulate the cells of the

178

nasal mucosa

179

determinant expression levels along proximal and distal regions of the respiratory tract 35. Additionally,

180

SARS-CoV-2 may even utilize a different cellular receptor in ferrets 36. Therefore, it would be of interest

181

to complement our current repository with AEC cultures from different anatomical regions of animals

182

like ferrets and to evaluate whether ACE2 is employed by SARS-CoV-2 as the cellular receptor in the

183

different animal species.

184

It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 spillover into the human population, like SARS-CoV, has

185

originated from bats, either directly or via an intermediate reservoir

186

species comprising more than 20% of all mammalian species, we restricted our experiments with SARS-

187

CoV-2 to our established AEC cultures from the two neotropical Carollia perspicillata and Sturnira lilium

188

bat species (Gultom et al Manuscript in preparation). We show that these two neotropical bats are not

189

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that they are not a likely reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2, despite

190

the detection of other coronaviruses and presumptive ACE2 receptor usage by SARS-CoV-2 in the

191

closely related bat species 38,39. Interestingly, it has recently been described that fruit bats (Rousettus

192

aegyptiacus) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection 23. Future research should therefore include AEC

193

cultures from these bats, as well as from horseshoe bat species (genus Rhinolophus), as they have

194

previously been characterized as a reservoir host for viruses that have a close genetic relationship with

195

the coronavirus associated with the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003 23,37.

. With more than 1200 bat

3,37

196

Taken together, our results highlight that in vitro well-differentiated airway epithelial models

197

in combination with high throughput genomic analysis can be applied as viable surrogate models to

198

refine, reduce, and replace animal experimentation to evaluate host tropism of respiratory viruses,

199

and thereby providing important insight into the host spectrum of SARS-CoV-2.

establishment of well-differentiated AEC cultures from diverse mammalian species, several

215

modifications to the composition of the ALI medium were introduced (Table. 1). All animal ALI cultures

216

were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. During the development of

217

differentiated ALI cultures (3-4 weeks), media was changed every 2-3 days.

218

Viruses

219

SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/München-1.1/2020/929) was kindly provided by Marcel Müller and Christian

Drosten. The virus stock was propagated in Vero E6 for 48 hours. Virus containing supernatant was

221

cleared from cell debris through centrifugation for 5 minutes at 500 × g before aliquoting and storage

222

at -80°C. The viral titer was determined by Plaque Forming Unit (PFU) assay on Vero E6 as previously

223

described 20,40.

224

The Influenza A/Hamburg/4/2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus strain in the pHW2000 reverse genetic

225

backbone was kindly provided by Martin Schwemmle, University of Freiburg, Germany. Working stocks

226

were prepared by propagating the rescued virus in MDCK-II cells for 72 hours in the infection medium,

227

which is composed of Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM), supplemented with 0,5% of BSA

228

(Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µg/ml Streptomycin and 100 IU/ml Penicillin (Gibco), 1 µg/ml Bovine pancreas-

230

assay on MDCK-II cells as described previously 41,42.

231

Influenza D virus (D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013) was kindly provided by Feng Li, South

Dakota University, United States. Virus stocks were propagated in the human rectal tumor cell line

233

HRT-18G (CRL11663, ATCC) for 96 hours in the infection medium, with the adjustment of using 0,25

234

μg/ml of trypsin. The viral titer was determined by TCID50 assay on HRT-18G cells as previously

235

described 43.

Infection of animal AEC cultures

238

Well-differentiated AEC cultures from 12 different species were infected with 30.000 PFU of SARS-CoV-

239

2, or 10.000 TCID50 of either IAV or IDV. Viruses were diluted in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS,

240

Gibco), inoculated via the apical side, and incubated for 1 h, at either 33°C or 37°C. Afterwards,

241

inoculum was removed, and the apical surfaces were rinsed three times with HBSS. Virus-infected and

242

control AEC cultures were incubated at the indicated temperatures in a humidified incubator with 5%

243

CO2. Progeny virus release was monitored with 24-hour intervals for a total duration of 96 hours,

244

through the application of 100 µl of HBSS onto the apical surface and incubated 10 min prior to the

245

collection time point. The collected apical washes were diluted 1:1 with virus transport medium (VTM)

246

and stored at -80°C for later analysis. Following the collection of the apical washes, the basolateral

247

medium was exchanged with fresh ALI medium. Each experiment was repeated as two independent

Immunofluorescence analysis

252

Virus-infected animal AEC cultures were fixed with 4% (v/v) neutral-buffered formalin at 96 hpi for

253

SARS-CoV-2 or 48 hpi for IAV/IDV infected AEC cultures and processed as previously described 18. For

254

the detection of SARS-CoV-2, fixed animal AEC cultures were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal

made rabbit polyclonal antibody against the NP of influenza D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 strain

259

(Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used, respectively. To visualize the distribution of ACE2 in the

260

AEC cultures, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ACE2 (ab15348, Abcam) was used. Alexa Fluor® 488-

261

labeled donkey anti-Rabbit and -mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson Immunoresearch) were used as secondary

262

antibodies. Alexa Fluor® 647-labeled rabbit anti-β-tubulin (9F3, Cell Signaling Technology and

263

EPR16775, Abcam) and Alexa Fluor® 594-labeled mouse anti-ZO1 (1A12, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were

264

used to visualize cilia and tight junctions, respectively. All samples were counterstained using 4’,6-

265

diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to visualize the nuclei. Imaging was

266

performed using EVOS FL Auto 2 Imaging System equipped with a Plan Apochromat 40x/0.95 air

267

objective. All images were processed using Fiji software packages 44. Brightness and contrast were

268

adjusted identically to their corresponding controls. Figures were assembled using the FigureJ plugin

Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)

271

Viral RNA was extracted from 100 µL of 1:1 diluted apical wash using the NucleoMag VET (Macherey-

272

Nagel AG, Oensingen, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, on a Kingfisher Flex

273

Purification system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). Two microliters of extracted RNA

274

were amplified using TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to

275

the

276

ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGTACTTCT-3′, reverse 5′- ACAATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACA -3′ and

277

probe 5′-FAM-ATCCTTACTGCGCTTCGA-MGB-Q530-3′ (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) targeting the

278

Envelope gene of SARS-CoV (AY291315.1) and SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947.3), which is an adapted version

279

of primers described by Corman and colleagues 46. As a positive control, a serial dilution of in vitro

280

transcribed RNA containing regions of the RdRp, E and N gene, derived from a SARS-CoV-2 synthetic

281

283

Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

284

Titration of SARS-CoV-2 in the apical washes

285

For the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 apical washes were titrated by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells.

286

Briefly, 1x105 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates one day prior to the titration and inoculated

287

with 10–fold serial dilutions of virus solutions. Inoculums were removed 1 hpi and replaced with

288

overlay medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 1.2% Avicel (RC-581, FMC biopolymer), 10%

289

heat-inactivated FBS, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C

290

with 5% CO2 for 48 hours and fixed with 4% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin prior to staining with crystal

291

violet 47.

ACE2 homology analysis

293

For the analysis on the conservation of ACE2 among different species, the available ACE2 protein

294

sequences

295

(XM_023248796.1), ferret (NM_001310190.1), dog (NM_001165260.1), rabbit (XM_002719845.3), pig

296

(NM_001123070.1),

297

(XM_010968001.1), and alpaca (XM_006212647.3). The protein alignment was performed using

298

ClustalW in Geneious 11.1.5. Software (Biomatters) using the default setting. ACE2 protein residues

299

interacting with SARS-CoV-2, receptor binding motif (RBM), were selected based on previous described

300

critical ACE2 residues interacting with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) 25,27.

301

Whole-Genome Sequencing using Oxford Nanopore (MinION)

302

Sequencing was performed on viral RNA isolated from the SARS-CoV-2 stock and the 96 hpi apical

303

washes of SARS-CoV-2-infected monkey and cat AEC cultures according to the ARTIC platform nCoV19

304

protocols 48,49. The v2 protocol was used as a basis for the reverse transcript and tiled multiplex PCR

305

reaction using the ARTIC nCoV-2019 V3 primer pool (see Table. S1), whereas the v3 protocol was used

306

for the downstream library preparation. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Native

307

Barcoding Expansion 96 kit (EXP-NBD196, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and sequenced on a MinION

308

R9.4.1 flowcell according to the manufacturer's instructions for a duration of 48 hours. Data acquisition

309

and real time high accuracy base-calling was performed using MinION software (v20.06.4).

310

Demultiplexing and read filtering were done according to the ARTIC platform nCoV19 pipeline and the

311

consensus calling was performed using the experimental Medaka pipeline. Consensus sequences were

312

aligned and further analyzed in Geneious 11.1.5. (Biomatters) using SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan-Hu-1
