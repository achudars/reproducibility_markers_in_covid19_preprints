ABSTRACT

27

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019

28

and has spread worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

29

Although animal models have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated

30

the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases. Here, we evaluate

31

heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell

32

cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal

33

inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung

34

tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as

35

measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer

36

and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes,

37

neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing

38

analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune

39

response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and

40

leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection

41

recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define

42

the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.

INTRODUCTION

45

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the recently

46

emerged RNA virus responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical

47

disease is variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death, with a

48

case-fatality rate of ~5%. The binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human angiotensin-I

49

converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) targets the virus to type II pneumocytes within the lung, resulting

50

in injury, inflammation, and subsequent respiratory distress1,2. Other COVID-19 manifestations

51

(e.g. cardiac dysfunction, coagulopathy, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms) suggest that extra-

52

pulmonary sites of infection contribute to disease pathogenesis in some patients3.

53

The development of countermeasures that reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is a

54

priority for the global research community, and animal models are essential for this effort.

55

Although several animal species used in laboratory research have been evaluated for

56

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated the severe disease seen in

57

hospitalized human cases. Hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates develop mild to moderate

58

viral disease and recover spontaneously4,5. Conventional laboratory strains of mice cannot be

59

infected efficiently by SARS-CoV-2 because hACE2 but not mouse ACE2 supports SARS-CoV-

60

2 binding6,7. Multiple strategies for introducing hACE2 into mice have been developed including

61

(1) transient introduction of hACE2 via adenoviral viral vectors8, (2) expression of hACE2 as a

62

transgene driven by heterologous gene promoters9,10, or (3) expression of hACE2 by the mouse

63

ACE2 promoter11,12. While these animals all support SARS-CoV-2 infection, none cause severe

64

disease or lethality. Thus, an animal model is still urgently needed for understanding the biology

65

of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluating the efficacy of countermeasures for COVID-19.

66

The K18-hACE2 transgenic (K18-hACE2) mice, in which hACE2 expression is driven by

67

the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 (K18) promoter13, were originally developed to study SARS-CoV

68

pathogenesis and cause lethal infection9. Here, we evaluate heterozygous hACE2 transgenic

69

mice as a model for severe COVID-19 disease. After intranasal SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, K183

70

hACE2 mice rapidly lost weight starting at 4 days post infection (dpi) and began to succumb to

71

disease at 7 dpi. High levels of viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in the lungs of infected

72

animals at 2, 4, and 7 dpi by RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization, and plaque forming assays. Infection

73

was accompanied by declines in multiple parameters of pulmonary function, substantial cellular

74

infiltrates in the lung composed of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells, high levels of

75

pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung homogenates, and severe interstitial and

76

consolidative pneumonia. Because of its severe disease and intense immune cell infiltration, the

77

K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection may facilitate evaluation of immunomodulatory and

78

antiviral drugs against COVID-19 and our understanding of immune-mediated mechanisms of

79

pathogenesis.

RESULTS

83

K18-hACE2 mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We inoculated 8-

84

week-old heterozygous K18-hACE2 mice of both sexes via intranasal route with 2.5×104 PFU of

85

SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020). Beginning at 4 days post-infection (dpi), K18-

86

hACE2 mice demonstrated marked weight loss, and by 7 dpi most animals had lost approximately

87

25% of their body weight (Fig 1a), with many becoming moribund. High levels of infectious SARS-

88

CoV-2 (Fig 1b) and viral RNA (Fig 1c) were detected in lung homogenates at 2, 4, and 7 dpi,

89

whereas lower levels were present in other tissues (e.g., heart, spleen, kidney). Virtually no viral

90

RNA was measured in gastrointestinal tract tissues or in circulation until 7 dpi in the serum and

91

colon, and this was only in a subset of animals (Fig 1d). The tissues supporting SARS-CoV-2

92

infection in this model mirrored the pattern of hACE2 expression, with the highest receptor levels

93

in the lungs, colon, kidney, and brain (Extended Data Fig 1a). Levels of hACE2 declined in the

94

lung over the course of infection (Extended Data Fig 1b), suggesting either receptor

95

downregulation, hACE2 shedding, or death of hACE2-expressing cells after SARS-CoV-2

96

infection. A subset of infected K18-hACE2 mice had high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus

97

in the brain (Fig 1d-e), consistent with previous reports with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in

98

hACE2 transgenic mice9,12,14. As no infectious virus and only low levels of viral RNA were detected

99

in the brain of the majority (60%) of animals, the observed clinical disease is more consistent with

100

lung and not brain infection. Staining for viral RNA in brain tissue by in situ hybridization showed

101

that only one of six animals was positive at 7 dpi.; this animal had disseminated infection

102

throughout the cerebral cortex with noticeable sparing of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum

103

(Extended Data Fig 2).

104

Histopathological changes in the lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of

105

hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections from K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2

106

(Fig 2a) showed a progressive inflammatory process. At 2 dpi, we observed accumulation of

107

immune cells confined predominantly to perivascular sites. By 4 dpi, these immune cell infiltrates

108

involved a greater area of the lung with focal collections into adjacent alveolar spaces with alveolar

109

wall thickening. By 7 dpi, immune cells, including neutrophils and mononuclear cells were found

110

throughout the lung in alveolar and interstitial locations along with interstitial edema and

111

consolidation. To correlate histopathological findings with sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we also

112

stained lung sections for viral RNA using in situ hybridization (Fig 2b). At 2 dpi, expression of

113

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was localized predominantly to alveolar epithelial cells and a few airway

114

epithelial cells. This pattern also was seen at 4 dpi, but with more diffuse spread throughout the

115

lung. By 7 dpi, the level of viral RNA expression was diminished and associated with cellular

116

debris and collapsed alveoli. No significant viral RNA signal was localized to immune cells.

117

Together, these findings provide evidence of a progressive and widespread viral pneumonia with

118

perivascular and pan-alveolar inflammation characterized by immune cell infiltration, edema, and

119

lung consolidation.

120

Extra-pulmonary histopathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined

121

additional tissues implicated in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 in humans, including the

122

brain, heart, liver, kidney, and spleen. Brain tissues of K18-hACE2 mice with minimal detectable

123

SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared normal, whereas the one brain with a high level of infection at 7

124

dpi showed multiple foci of inflammatory cells (e.g., neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes)

125

involving the meninges, the subarachnoid space, parenchymal blood vessels, and the brain

126

parenchyma (Extended Data Fig 3a). Abnormalities were observed in 2 of 9 hearts at 4 dpi (e.g.,

127

scattered hypereosinophilic cardiomyocytes with pyknotic nuclei) and most livers at 4 and 7 dpi

128

(e.g., areas of inflammatory cell infiltrates and hepatocyte loss) (Extended Data Fig 3b-c). In one

129

kidney at 4 dpi, we observed focal acute tubular injury (Extended Data Fig 3d); otherwise, the

130

kidneys showed no apparent abnormalities. The spleen in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2

131

mice appeared normal (Extended Data Fig 3e), and fibrin thrombi were not detected in any of

132

the extra-pulmonary organs examined.

133

Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess for clinically-relevant changes in

134

physiology over the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we measured clinical

135

chemistry and hematological parameters from peripheral blood samples (Fig 3). Plasma levels of

136

sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations and the anion gap all trended slightly downward

137

at 7 dpi (Fig 3a-d) whereas plasma bicarbonate noticeably increased (Fig 3e), possibly as a result

138

of poor gas exchange resulting from lung pathology or decreased respiratory drive. Other plasma

139

analytes including calcium, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen were unchanged (Fig 3f-h).

140

Hematocrit and plasma hemoglobin levels increased later in the course of infection, possibly

141

because of reduced water intake and hemoconcentration (Fig 3i-j). We also observed a modest

142

prolongation in the prothrombin time at 7 dpi that was preceded by an increase in D-dimer

143

concentrations on 2 and 4 dpi (Fig 3k-l).

144

We next examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pulmonary and cardiac function

145

using a treadmill stress-test to assess exercise tolerance (Fig 3m). Compared to mock-infected

146

controls, at 4 dpi, a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice began to show reduced

147

exercise tolerance, as measured by decreased distance travelled. However, by 5 dpi, all infected

148

K18-hACE2 mice had substantially reduced exercise tolerance compared to mock-infected

149

animals or their own pre-infection baseline performance (Fig 3m).

150

To examine changes to the biophysical properties of the lung over the course of SARS-

151

CoV-2 infection, we mechanically ventilated mice via tracheostomy and performed several forced-

152

oscillation tests to determine various respiratory mechanics parameters (Fig 3n-w). Infected

153

animals showed normal lung biomechanics at 2 and 4 dpi but had markedly abnormal values in

154

most parameters at 7 dpi relative to mock-infected controls. These abnormalities included

155

reduced inspiratory capacity as well as increased respiratory system resistance and elastance

156

(Fig 3n-p). Collectively, these changes resulted in a downward deflection of the pressure-volume

157

loop (Fig 3r) with concomitant decreases in static compliance (Fig 3q), the shape-describing K

158

parameter (Fig 3s), and loop hysteresis (Fig 3t), which together indicate reduced lung compliance

159

and distensibility. Further analysis using broadband forced oscillation maneuvers15 revealed that

160

SARS-CoV-2 infected mice at 7 dpi had relatively normal Newtonian resistance (Fig 3u), which

161

is primarily a reflection of resistance in larger conducting airways. In contrast, mice at 7 dpi had

162

marked increases in tissue damping (Fig 3v) and elastance (Fig 3w); these parameters measure

163

the dissipation and storage of oscillatory energy in parenchymal tissue and reflect tissue and

164

peripheral airway resistance and elastic recoil (i.e., tissue stiffness), respectively. The

165

measurements of mechanical properties of the respiratory system suggest that SARS-CoV-2

166

infection in K18-hACE2 mice predominantly causes disease in the alveoli and lung parenchyma,

167

and not in the conducting airways, which is consistent with both our histopathological analysis in

168

mice and measurements of pulmonary function in humans with viral pneumonia and respiratory

169

failure including COVID-1916.

170

The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the lungs. An excessive pro-

171

inflammatory host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is hypothesized to contribute to pulmonary

172

pathology and the development of respiratory distress in some COVID-19 patients17. To evaluate

173

the composition of the immune cell response in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice, we

174

performed flow cytometric analysis on lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid

175

at three time points after intranasal virus inoculation (Fig 4a-b, Extended Data Fig 4). Consistent

176

with our histopathological analysis, we observed increased numbers of CD45+ immune cells in

177

the BAL beginning at 2 dpi and in the lung at 4 dpi. The cellular infiltrates at 4 and 7 dpi in the

178

lung were composed principally of myeloid cell subsets including Ly6G+ neutrophils, Ly6C+

179

monocytes, and CD11b+CD11c+ dendritic cells. In the BAL fluid, monocyte numbers peaked at 4

180

dpi, and levels of neutrophils and dendritic cells continued to rise through 7 dpi. Accumulation of

181

monocytes in the BAL fluid coincided with a decrease in the number of tissue-resident alveolar

182

macrophages, an observation consistent with scRNA-seq analysis of BAL fluid of patients with

183

severe COVID-19 disease18,19. By 7 dpi, we also observed an increase in several lymphoid cell

184

subsets in the lung including NK1.1+ natural killer cells, γδ CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells,

185

CD3+CD8+ T cells, and activated CD44+CD3+CD8+ T cells (Fig 4a).

186

Extensive changes in cytokine profiles are associated with COVID-19 disease

187

progression20-22. Compared to the lungs of uninfected K18-hACE2 control mice, we observed

188

induction of Ifnb, Il28, Ifng, Cxcl10, Cxcl11, and Ccl2 mRNA over the first week (Fig 4c) with

189

highest expression occurring at 2 dpi for all cytokines except Ifng and Ccl2. We also measured

190

protein levels in the lungs using a multiplex assay of 44 different cytokines and chemokines (Fig

191

4d, Extended Data Fig 5). Although mRNA expression was highest at 2 dpi, almost all up-

192

regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNβ, IL-6, CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, CCL12, TIMP-1,

193

TNFα, and G-CSF), T cell-associated cytokines (IL-10, IFNγ, and IL-2), and myeloid cell-

194

associated chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, and LIF) peaked at 7 dpi. These data are

195

consistent with cytokine profiling of serum from human COVID-19 patients and transcriptional

196

analysis of the BAL fluid of human patients, which showed that elevated levels of IL-10, IL-6, IL-

197

2, IL-7, G-CSF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and TNF-α correlate with disease severity19,23-25. Overall,

198

our data suggest that in the context of the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs of

199

K18-hACE2 mice, many cytokines and chemokines are induced, with some having sustained

200

expression and others showing rapid up-and down regulation patterns.

201

Distinct transcriptional signatures are associated with early and late immune

202

responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in other small animals and humans have reported

203

cytokine signatures coupled with delayed type I interferon (IFN) signaling or elevated IFN

204

signatures in the lung26,27. To assess how the kinetics of infection and ensuing inflammation

205

modulate the cytokine and IFN response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed RNA sequencing of lung

206

homogenates of K18-Tg mice at 0 (mock), 2, 4, and 7 dpi. Principal component analysis (PCA)

207

revealed distinct transcriptional signatures associated at 7 dpi (Fig 5a) with overlapping

208

signatures at 2 and 4 dpi. Hundreds of genes were differentially expressed at all time points

209

compared to mock-infected animals (Fig 5b), many of these associated with IFN signaling, NF9

210

kB-dependent cytokine responses, or leukocyte activation. In agreement with the PCA, only 449

211

differentially expressed genes were shared at all time points when compared to mock. In contrast,

212

1,975 unique differentially expressed genes were identified between mock to 7 dpi whereas only

213

59 and 152 genes were different between mock and 2 and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig 5c). Gene

214

ontology analysis of the top upregulated genes at all time points showed enrichment of gene

215

clusters in cytokine-mediated signaling, type I and II IFN signaling, neutrophil activation, and

216

pathogen recognition receptor signaling (Fig 5d). Upregulation of gene sets involved in cytokine-

217

mediated signaling, neutrophil activation, cellular responses to type II IFN, and toll-like receptor

218

signaling were most pronounced at 7 dpi (Fig 5e-g, Extended Data Fig 6a-c, Supplementary

219

Table 1). Of note, different genes in the type I IFN signaling pathway were upregulated at 2 and

220

4 dpi (e.g., Irf9, Irf7, Stat1, and certain IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) Isg15, Mx1, Oas3, Ifit1, Ifit2,

221

and Ifit3) versus 7 dpi (e.g., Ifnar1/2, Tyk2, Irf1 and certain ISGs Samhd1, Oas2, and Ifitm1). This

222

suggests a temporally distinct type I IFN response (Fig 5f), which has been described previously

223

with IFNa and IFNb subtypes28-30. Alternatively, the differences in IFN and ISG signatures at early

224

and late time points could reflect differential signaling contributions of type I and III IFNs, as these

225

cytokines are both expressed in the lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection31 and induce overlapping

226

yet non-identical sets of ISGs32. Collectively, the RNA sequencing data from the lungs of K18-

227

hACE2 mice show distinct immune signatures associated with early infection (days 2 and 4) and

228

late (day 7) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DISCUSSION

231

In this study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice causes

232

severe pulmonary disease. After intranasal SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, K18-hACE2 mice rapidly

233

lost weight after 4 dpi and began to succumb to disease at 7 dpi. High levels of viral RNA and

234

infectious virus were detected in the lungs of infected animals at 2, 4, and 7 dpi by RT-qPCR, in

235

situ hybridization, and plaque assay. Infection was accompanied by high levels of pro-

236

inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lung and an impressive cellular infiltrate comprised

237

primarily of monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells. The combined infection and inflammation

238

resulted in severe interstitial pneumonia characterized by collapsed alveolar spaces. This caused

239

detrimental changes in lung physiology including decreased exercise tolerance, reduced

240

inspiratory capacity, and stiffening of the lung parenchyma.

241

SARS-CoV-2 infection is subclinical or mild in most human cases. A small, yet clinically

242

important fraction develop life-threatening disease requiring hospitalization and intensive care.

243

Mild disease is a feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in naturally susceptible animals including

244

hamsters, ferrets, cats, and non-human primates5. This is perhaps unsurprising given that the

245

strongest risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 in humans (e.g., old age, cardiovascular

246

disease, and diabetes) are absent in many laboratory animals. Mild to moderate disease is seen

247

in many rodent models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those expressing hACE2 via viral

248

vectors or transgenes8,11,12,33. Thus, the severity of disease we observed following SARS-CoV-2

249

infection of K18-hACE2 mouse is unique. As the onset of severe clinical disease in K18-hACE2

250

mice occurs days after peak viral infection and is associated with high levels of infiltrating immune

251

cells and inflammatory mediators in the lung, immune responses likely contribute to pathogenesis.

252

The histopathological changes we observed in the infected lungs of K18-hACE2 mice

253

correlate with the impaired pulmonary function. Pneumocytes become infected early, which led

254

to recruitment of leukocytes into the pulmonary interstitium, production of proinflammatory

255

cytokines, injury to parenchymal cells, collapse of the alveolar space, and compromise of gas

256

exchange, all of which could cause the hypercapnia we observed at 7 dpi. This course is

257

remarkably consistent with human disease in which rapid early viral replication is followed by

258

inflammatory responses, which are believed to contribute to pathology, morbidity, and mortality34.

259

A fundamental understanding of the immunological processes that influence COVID-19

260

disease is needed to select immunomodulatory interventions that target key cell types or

261

pathways. We saw substantial immune cell accumulation in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice, an

262

observation consistent with post-mortem analysis of human patients35. Infiltrates were composed

263

primarily of myeloid cells including monocytes and neutrophils as well as activated CD8+ T cells

264

and corresponded with high levels of chemokines that drive their migration. The lymphopenia

265

associated with severe COVID-19 in humans is attributed in part to the immune cell migration into

266

inflamed tissues21,36. In transcriptional analyses of BAL fluid from infected humans with severe

267

COVID-19, an accumulation of CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and monocytes coincided with the loss

268

of alveolar macrophages18,19. In our study, using cytokine analysis and RNA-sequencing of lung

269

homogenates, we detected enhanced expression of several myeloid cell chemoattractants (e.g.,

270

CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, and CXCL10) and other key inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-6,

271

and G-CSF) that correlate with COVID-19 disease severity in humans26,27. Given these parallel

272

findings, studies in K18-hACE2 mice evaluating the role of specific immune pathways and cell

273

subsets in disease pathogenesis could inform the selection of immunomodulatory agents for

274

severe COVID-19.

275

The role of type I IFN in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in this model warrants further

276

investigation, as it has been suggested that a dysregulated type I IFN response contributes to

277

excessive immunopathology. Indeed, in SARS-CoV infection, type I IFN signaling appears pro-

278

inflammatory and not antiviral37. Our RNA sequencing analysis revealed differences in the type I

279

IFN gene signatures associated with early and late SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that ISGs can

280

exert diverse functions apart from their antiviral activities, including inflammatory, metabolic, and

281

transcriptional effects38, these two “early” and “late” ISG modules may have different functional

282

consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, how these temporally distinct

283

programs are induced and regulated remains uncertain and may be the result of cell-type

284

specificity, kinetics, and sensitivity to different type I or III IFN subtypes.

285

The development of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection is an important

286

feature of the K18-hACE2 model, although the precise reason for this susceptibility compared to

287

other hACE2 transgenic models remains unknown. Potential explanations include a high number

288

of hACE2 transgene insertions (https://www.jax.org/strain/034860) and/or the strength and

289

cellular specificity of the K18 promoter. Human ACE2 is expressed in multiple tissues in the K18-

290

hACE2 mouse9, which could allow for SARS-CoV-2 infection of multiple organs. While we

291

detected viral RNA in several tissues, the lung was the most heavily infected and showed the

292

most consistent and severe histopathological changes; these findings were anticipated given the

293

known tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for the respiratory tract and the intranasal route of infection.

294

Moderate levels of viral RNA also were found in the heart, kidney, and spleen, with peak titers at

295

2 and 4 dpi, whereas levels in gastrointestinal tract tissues (duodenum, ileum, and colon) were

296

lower. In the gastrointestinal tract of K18-hACE2 mice, hACE2 was expressed most abundantly

297

in the colon, which correlated with infection seen at later time points. Although hACE2 is

298

expressed in the gastrointestinal tract in other hACE2-expressing mice, productive infection was

299

observed only upon intragastric inoculation or at early time points following intranasal

300

infection11,12.

301

We observed dichotomous SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain, with high virus levels in

302

approximately 40% of mice at 7 dpi, and low levels in the remaining 60% of animals. Infection of

303

the brain also was observed in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV9,14 but occurred earlier

304

(at 3 to 4 dpi) and more uniformly. Similar to the experiments with SARS-CoV, we did not detect

305

SARS-CoV-2 in the olfactory bulb, which suggests that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cross

306

the blood-brain barrier instead of traversing the cribriform plate and infecting neuronal processes

307

near the site of intranasal inoculation39. Notwithstanding this data, and unlike SARS-CoV,

308

alterations in smell and taste are features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans40, suggesting that

309

cell types within the olfactory system may be susceptible to infection or injury. More study is

310

needed to clarify the routes SARS-CoV-2 dissemination throughout the host and particularly how

311

it accesses the brain in some animals and humans.

312

While SARS-CoV-2 lung infection in K18-hACE2 mice provides a model for studying

313

severe infection that recapitulates features of COVID-19 in humans, we acknowledge several

314

limitations. The expression of the hACE2 transgene is non-physiological in several respects. It is

315

driven by a non-native (i.e., the cytokeratin-18) promotor, resulting in tissue expression levels that

316

are distinct from endogenously-expressed ACE2. ACE2 expression in K18-hACE2 mice is

317

independent of the complex regulatory systems that governs ACE2 levels41. As such, comorbid

318

conditions (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes) that alter ACE2 expression in humans41 likely

319

cannot be modelled faithfully in this transgenic mouse.

320

In summary, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice supports

321

robust viral replication in the lung, which leads to severe immune cell infiltration, inflammation,

322

and pulmonary disease. Thus, the K18-hACE2 mouse is an attractive small animal model for

323

defining the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and may be useful for

324

evaluating countermeasures that reduce virus infection or associated pathological inflammatory

325

responses.

METHODS

470

Cells and viruses. Vero E6 (CRL-1586, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Vero

471

CCL81 (ATCC), and Vero-furin cells42 were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle

472

medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 1 mM

473

sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 100 U/ml of penicillin–streptomycin. The

474

2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2019 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from the US Centers for

475

Disease Control (CDC). Infectious stocks were grown by inoculating Vero CCL81 cells and

476

collecting supernatant upon observation of cytopathic effect; debris was removed by

477

centrifugation and passage through a 0.22 μm filter. Supernatant was then aliquoted and stored

478

at -80oC.

479

Biosafety. All aspects of this study were approved by the office of Environmental Health

480

and Safety at Washington University School of Medicine prior to the initiation of this study. Work

481

with SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory by personnel equipped with powered air

482

purifying respirators.

483

Mice. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the

484

Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The

485

protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington

486

University School of Medicine (assurance number A3381–01). Virus inoculations were performed

487

under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine,

488

and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

489

Heterozygous K18-hACE c57BL/6J mice (strain: 2B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) were

490

obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were housed in groups and fed standard chow

491

diets. Mice of different ages and both sexes were administered 2.5 x 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 via

492

intranasal administration.

493

Plaque forming assay. Vero-furin cells42 were seeded at a density of 2.5×105 cells per

494

well in flat-bottom 12-well tissue culture plates. The following day, media was removed and

495

replaced with 200 μL of 10-fold serial dilutions of the material to be titered, diluted in DMEM+2%

496

FBS. One hours later, 1 mL of methylcellulose overlay was added. Plates were incubated for 72

497

hours, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (final concentration) in phosphate-buffered saline for

498

20 minutes. Plates were stained with 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% methanol and washed

499

twice with distilled, deionized H20.

500

Measurement of viral burden and hACE2 expression. Tissues were weighed and

501

homogenized with zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 1000 μL

502

of DMEM media supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Tissue homogenates were clarified

503

by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and stored at −80°C. RNA was extracted using the

504

MagMax mirVana Total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Scientific) on the Kingfisher Flex extraction

505

robot (Thermo Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the TaqMan RNA-to-

506

CT 1-Step Kit (ThermoFisher). Reverse transcription was carried out at 48°C for 15 min followed

507

by 2 min at 95°C. Amplification was accomplished over 50 cycles as follows: 95°C for 15 s and

508

60°C for 1 min. Copies of SARS-CoV-2 N gene RNA in samples were determined using a

509

previously published assay8. Briefly, a TaqMan assay was designed to target a highly conserved

510

region of the N gene (Forward primer: ATGCTGCAATCGTGCTACAA; Reverse primer:

511

GACTGCCGCCTCTGCTC; Probe: /56-FAM/TCAAGGAAC/ZEN/AACATTGCCAA/3IABkFQ/).

512

This region was included in an RNA standard to allow for copy number determination down to 10

513

copies per reaction. The reaction mixture contained final concentrations of primers and probe of

514

500 and 100 nM, respectively.

515

For hACE2 expression, RNA was DNase-treated (Thermo Scientific) following the

516

521

High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Scientific) with the addition of RNase

522

inhibitor following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cytokine and chemokine expression was

523

determined using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (Thermo Scientific) with commercial

524

primers/probe sets specific for IFN-g (IDT: Mm.PT.58.41769240), IL-6 (Mm.PT.58.10005566), IL-

525

1b (Mm.PT.58.41616450), TNF-a (Mm.PT.58.12575861), CXCL10 (Mm.PT.58.43575827), CCL2

526

(Mm.PT.58.42151692), CCL5 (Mm.PT.58.43548565), CXCL11 (Mm.PT.58.10773148.g), IFN-b

527

(Mm.PT.58.30132453.g), and IL-28a/b (Thermo Scientific Mm04204156_gH) and results were

528

normalized to GAPDH (Mm.PT.39a.1) levels. Fold change was determined using the 2-DDCt

529

method comparing treated mice to naïve controls.

530

Cytokine and chemokine protein measurements. Lung homogenates were incubated

531

with Triton-X-100 (1% final concentration) for 1 h at room temperature to inactivate SARS-CoV-

532

2. Homogenates then were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines by Eve Technologies

533

Corporation (Calgary, AB, Canada) using their Mouse Cytokine Array / Chemokine Array 44-Plex

534

(MD44) platform.

535

Histology and RNA in situ hybridization. Animals were euthanized before harvest and

536

fixation of tissues. The left lung was first tied off at the left main bronchus and collected for viral

537

RNA analysis. The right lung then was inflated with ~1.2 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin

538

using a 3-mL syringe and catheter inserted into the trachea. For harvesting of brains for fixation,

539

the mouse was decapitated, and the skull cap removed. The whole brain was removed intact, cut

540

mid-sagittally to increase surface area of fixation, and drop fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin

541

(NBF). For kidney, spleen, liver, and heart, organs were removed and drop-fixed in 10% NBF. For

542

fixation after infection, organs were kept in a 40-mL suspension of NBF for 7 days before further

543

processing. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and sections were stained with hematoxylin and

544

eosin. RNA in situ hybridization was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Assay (Brown Kit)

545

according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, sections were

546

deparaffinized, treated with H2O2 and Protease Plus prior to probe hybridization. Probes

547

specifically targeting hACE2 (cat no. 848151) or SARS-CoV-2 S sequence (cat no 848561) were

548

hybridized followed by proprietary signal amplification and detection with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine.

549

Tissues were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin. An uninfected mouse was used as a

550

negative control and stained in parallel. Tissue sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse

551

microscope equipped with an Olympus DP71 camera, a Leica DM6B microscope equipped with

552

a Leica DFC7000T camera, or an Olympus BX51 microscope with attached camera.

553

Flow cytometry analysis of immune cell infiltrates. For analysis of BAL fluid, mice

554

were sacrificed by ketamine overdose, followed by cannulation of the trachea with a 19-G canula.

555

BAL was performed with three washes of 0.8 ml of sterile PBS. BAL fluid was centrifuged, and

556

single cell suspensions were generated for staining. For analysis of lung tissue, mice were

557

perfused with sterile PBS and the right inferior lung lobes were digested at 37°C with 630 µg/ml

558

collagenase D (Roche) and 75 U/ml DNase I (Sigma) for 2 hours. Single cell suspensions of BAL

559

and lung digests were preincubated with Fc Block antibody (BD PharMingen) in PBS + 2% heat-

560

inactivated FBS for 10 min at room temperature before staining. Cells were incubated with

561

antibodies against the following markers: AF700 anti-CD45 (clone 30 F-11), APC-Cy7 anti-CD11c

562

(clone N418), PE anti-Siglec F (clone E50-2440; BD), PE-Cy7 anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8), BV605 anti-

563

Ly6C (clone HK1.4; Biolegend), BV 711 anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), APC anti-CD103 (clone 2E7;

565

CD8 (clone53-6.7), anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136), and BV605 anti-TCR γ/δ (clone GL3). All

566

antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200. Cells were stained for 20 min at 4°C, washed, fixed

567

and permeabilized for intracellular staining with Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set

568

(eBioscience) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C

569

with PE-Cy5 anti-Foxp3 (clone FJK-16s), washed, re-fixed with 4% PFA (EMS) for 20 min and

570

resuspended in permeabilization buffer. Absolute cell counts were determined using TruCount

571

beads (BD). Flow cytometry data were acquired on a cytometer (BD-X20; BD Biosciences) and

572

analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

573

Clinical laboratory analysis. Testing was performed on fresh whole-blood samples

574

within a biosafety cabinet using point-of-care instruments. Prothrombin time was measured using

575

the Coagucheck (Roche) meter. Electrolyte, acid-base, and hematology parameters were

576

assayed on lithium-heparinized whole blood using the iSTAT-1 (Abbot) with the Chem8+

577

cartridge.

578

Respiratory mechanics. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and

579

10 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). The trachea was isolated via dissection of the neck area and

580

cannulated using an 18-gauge blunt metal cannula (typical resistance of 0.18 cmH2O.s/mL), which

581

was secured in place with a nylon suture. The mouse then was connected to the flexiVent

582

computer-controlled piston ventilator (SCIREQ Inc.) via the cannula, which was attached to the

583

FX adaptor Y-tubing. Mechanical ventilation was initiated, and mice were given an additional 100

584

mg/kg of ketamine and 0.1 mg/mouse of the paralytic pancuronium bromide via intraperitoneal

585

route to prevent breathing efforts against the ventilator and during measurements. Mice were

586

ventilated using default settings for mice, which consisted in a positive end expiratory pressure at

587

3 cm H2O, a 10 mL/kg tidal volume (Vt), a respiratory rate at 150 breaths per minute (bpm), and

588

an fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21 (i.e., room air). Respiratory mechanics were assessed

589

using the forced oscillation technique, as previously described43, using the latest version of the

590

flexiVent operating software (flexiWare v8.1.3). Pressure-volume loops and measurements of

591

inspiratory capacity were also done.

592

Treadmill stress test. A six-lane mouse treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH)

593

was placed within a biosafety cabinet within the ABSL-3 laboratory. Mice were introduced to the

594

treadmill test three times prior to infection, with each introductory session performed at

595

increasingly faster rates. In general, the treadmill was set to ramp from 0 to maximum speed over

596

the course of the first minute, then maintain maximum speed for 5 min. Failure to maintain

597

adequate speed resulted in delivery of a shock; this occurred until the animal reinguaged the

598

treadmill for a maximum of 5 failures. For each sex, we identified a speed at which >80% of mice

599

successfully completed the test prior to infection (16 m/s for female; 14 m/s for male).

600

RNA sequencing. cDNA libraries were constructed starting with 10 ng of total RNA from

601

lung tissues of each sample that was extracted using a MagMax mirVana Total RNA isolation kit

602

(Thermo Scientific). cDNA was generated using the Seqplex kit (Sigma-Aldrich) with amplification

603

of 20 cycles. Library construction was performed using 100 ng of cDNA undergoing end repair, A

604

tailing, ligation of universal TruSeq adapters and amplification of 8 cycles to incorporate unique

605

dual index sequences. Libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA)

606

targeting 40 million read pairs and extending 150 cycles with paired end reads. RNA-seq reads

607

were aligned to the mouse Ensembl GRCh38.76 primary assembly and SARS-CoV-2 NCBI

608

NC_045512 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome with STAR program (version 2.5.1a)44. Gene counts were

609

derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount

610

(version 1.4.6-p5)45. The ribosomal fraction, known junction saturation, and read distribution over

611

known gene models were quantified with RSeQC (version 2.6.2)46. All gene counts were

612

preprocessed with the R package EdgeR47 to adjust samples for differences in library size using

613

the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization procedure. Ribosomal genes and genes not

614

expressed at a level greater than or equal to 1 count per million reads in the smallest group size

615

were excluded from further analysis. The R package limma48 with voomWithQualityWeights

616

function49 was utilized to calculate the weighted likelihoods for all samples, based on the observed

617

mean-variance relationship of every gene and sample. Differentially expressed genes were

618

defined as those with at least 2-fold difference between two individual groups at the Benjamini-

619

Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value, i.e. q-value < 0.05.

620

Statistical analysis Statistical significance was assigned when P values were < 0.05
