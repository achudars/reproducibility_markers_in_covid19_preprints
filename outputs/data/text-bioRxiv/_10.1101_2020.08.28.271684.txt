Abstract
We assessed the infectivity, replication dynamics and cytopathogenicity of the first
Swedish isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in six different cell lines of human origin and compared their
growth characteristics. High replication kinetics in absence of cytopathic-effect observed in many
cell lines provided important clues on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Introduction
In the current pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), numerous research activities
have been focusing on better understanding the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis as well as
developing effective antivirals against the infection(1–5). In this scenario, Vero-E6 cell line has
been widely employed for viral isolation, propagation and antiviral testing, due to its high
infectivity, virus production and a prominent cytopathic effect (CPE) upon infection. However,
since Vero-E6 originates from monkey, a more physiologically relevant cell line of human origin
is warranted, that is better able to recapitulate the complexity of host cellular response to the
SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, we aimed at determining the SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication capacity
in six different human cell lines that are commonly used in laboratories. Our data provide a
comprehensive view on how SARS-CoV-2 behaves differently in different human cell lines
depending on the viral strain and, possibly, the isolation method. Overall, our work represents a
useful tool for choosing a suitable cell system to investigate the viral pathogenicity and drug
susceptibility.

The Study
We infected Vero-E6 (ATCC#CRL-1586), Calu-3 (ATCC#HTB-55), A549 (ATCC#CCL185), Caco2 (CLS-300137), Huh7, 293T and 16HBE with the first Swedish isolate of SARS-CoV2 virus (SWE/01/2020) at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 and 0.1 as previously described(1).
Virus-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the cellular ATP using Viral-ToxGlo™

assay (Promega) and virus replication kinetics were determined in the cell culture supernatant by
qPCR targeting the N-gene(6) using PrimeDirect™ Probe RT-qPCR mix (Takara) starting at 3h
post-infection (hpi) and followed up to 120hpi(1). As shown in Figure 1A, infection with moi 0.1
showed better kinetics than moi 1 and attained similar viral-copies at 120hpi. At moi 0.1 Vero-E6
showed a complete CPE (viability<3%) by 48hpi and a significant increase of 3.8 log10 viralcopies at 24hpi. Of the six human cell lines that were tested, Caco2 (intestinal) showed highest
infection with a 4.3 log10 copies rise in viral load at 120hpi, with moi 0.1 (p<0.001). 293T
(kidney;p<0.01), Huh7 (liver;p<0.02) and Calu-3 (lung;p<0.05) showed moderate infection with
a change of >1 log10 viral-copies at 120hpi, while 16HBE (lung) and A549 (lung) showed very
poor infectivity with a change of <0.6 log10 viral-copies. Interestingly, viral-induced cytotoxicity
was only observed in Calu-3 cells (viability at moi 1= 50% and moi 0.1=77%) while none of the
other cell lines showed any apparent cytotoxicity (viability>85%) (Figure 1B).
ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 activity has been shown to be critical for SARS-CoV-2
entry into the cell(5,7). To correlate the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression with the infectivity, we
determined the protein expression in the cell lysates by western blot (Figure 2A). Among the
infected cell lines, co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was most prominent in Caco2, followed
by Vero-E6 and Calu-3 that showed poor TMPRSS2 expression. Contrarily, Huh7 and 293T
strongly expressed TMPRSS2 but lacked ACE2 expression. Our results showed no strong
correlation between co-expression of the receptors and infectivity, indicating that each receptor
has an individual role in aiding the infection.
Finally, to compare the tropism of Swedish SARS-CoV-2 virus with the other globally
isolated strains, we performed a literature survey to determine the infectivity and cytopathogenicity
in all the six cell lines as noted above. We have included virus isolates from Germany

Specifically, we observed that the majority of the strains were able to infect both Caco2 and Calu3, except for the Muc_IMB1/2020 (no infectivity in both the cell lines)(4) and the Japanese strain
(no infectivity in Calu-3)(7). The Frankfurt_FFM1/2020 strain showed a rapid CPE in Caco2 by
24h at moi of 0.1(2), while other strains, including Swedish isolate, did not show any prominent
CPE either at higher infective dose or with prolonged time of incubation (3). Lastly, using the
Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 strain as reference, we interrogated the amino acid changes in the spike protein
of these strains. The Frankfurt and Taiwan strains showed no dissimilarities, while the
Swedish(F797C), Munich(D614G), China(N74K) and Hong Kong(V367F) strains each showed a
single amino acid substitution (Figure 2C).

Conclusion
Establishing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cytopathogenicity in a human cell line is key to
testing new antivirals as well as understanding viral-host interplay in a more physiologically
relevant setting. Several recent studies testing different local strains, show conflicting results
concerning infectivity and cytopathogenicity in human cell lines (Figure 2B), especially when
Caco2 and Calu-3 cells are employed. Particularly, the Swedish isolate tested here showed high
infectivity in Caco2 and moderate infectivity for Calu-3, not aligning with any particular strain. A
stark difference was also noted in cytopathogenicity, wherever reported. In our study, upon

infection, Calu-3 stopped growing, rounded up and mottled, as compared to the uninfected control.
The morphological change observed in Calu-3 might represent a cellular mechanism to control
viral infection and therefore needs more investigation. In Caco2 we did not observe any
appreciable cytopathogenicity as was reported for the French(8) and the Honk Kong strain(3).
However, the Frankfurt strain caused rapid CPE in Caco2 within 24hpi. Unlike others, the
Frankfurt strain was the only strain that was isolated and adapted in Caco2 that could have possibly
lead to higher infectivity and CPE of this strain in the cell line(2). In addition, different infective
doses, structural changes in the virus, culture conditions and clonal differences in the cell lines,
could also govern strain specific differences in infectivity.
A major role in viral infectivity is played by envelope glycoproteins and cellular receptors,
which initiate the early phases of the viral life cycle. Therefore, we first investigated whether
mutations in the spike glycoproteins of the different strains presented above could affect their
infectivity and cytopathogenicity. However, no major amino acid changes was observed in the
spike protein, except for the Munich strain harboring D614G mutation that had become the
dominant genotype in Europe and considered to be more infectious in humans(13). Interestingly,
this strain shows no infectivity in both Caco2 and Calu-3(4).We then correlated the viral infectivity
with the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins that are considered essential for viral entry.
Our results showed no strong correlation between co-expression of the receptors and infectivity
and suggest that while ACE2 expression is important for the virus infectivity, increased expression
of TMPRSS2 alone can enhance virus uptake into the cell(14). However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that other molecules or endocytosis mechanisms are involved in viral recognition and
entry. In addition, in the present study, we have investigated the replicative capacity of the virus
by measuring the newly produced virions in the culture supernatant. In different cell lines there

might be other mechanisms that interfere with viral replication following entry, that require further
validation.
In conclusion, our study warrants the need for physiologically relevant models to study the
biological properties of SARS-CoV-2 which requires understanding of the viral and host factors
that govern infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different cell lines.
