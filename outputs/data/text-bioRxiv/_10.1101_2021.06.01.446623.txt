ABSTRACT
Repurposing FDA-approved inhibitors able to prevent infection by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could provide a rapid path to
establish new therapeutic options to mitigate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Proteolytic cleavages of the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2, mediated by
the host cell proteases cathepsin and TMPRSS2, alone or in combination, are key early
activation steps required for efficient infection. The PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod
interferes with late endosomal viral traffic, and through an ill-defined mechanism
prevents in vitro infection through late endosomes mediated by cathepsin. Similarly,
inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity by camostat mesylate or nafamostat mesylate
prevents infection mediated by the TMPRSS2-dependent and cathepsin-independent
pathway. Here, we combined the use of apilimod with camostat mesylate or nafamostat
mesylate and found an unexpected ~5-10 fold increase in their effectiveness to prevent
SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell types. Comparable synergism was observed
using both, a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing S of SARS-CoV-2
(VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus. The substantial ~5 fold or more decrease
of half maximal effective concentrations (EC50 values) suggests a plausible treatment
strategy based on the combined use of these inhibitors.

IMPORTANCE
Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) global pandemic. There are ongoing
efforts to uncover effective antiviral agents that could mitigate the severity of the

disease by controlling the ensuing viral replication. Promising candidates include small
molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activities of host proteins, thus preventing SARSCoV-2 entry and infection. They include Apilimod, an inhibitor of PIKfyve kinase and
camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, inhibitors of TMPRSS2 protease. Our
research is significant for having uncovered an unexpected synergism in the effective
inhibitory activity of apilimod used together with camostat mesylate or with nafamostat
mesylate.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused
the global pandemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Currently
there is no widespread use of an antiviral agent against the disease, but several
candidates have been identified (1-6). Apilimod is currently in a clinical trial for the
prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States of America (ClinicalTrails.gov
Identifier: NCT04446377). The TMPRSS2 protease inhibitor camostat mesylate has
been tested with hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Denmark (7) and is in a clinical trial
on adult COVID-19 patients in France (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifier: NCT04608266),
while the higher affinity TMPRSS2 protease inhibitor, nafamostat mesylate, is being
used in COVID-19 related trials in Russia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04623021),
South Korea (ClinicalTrails.gov Identifier: NCT04418128) and Japan (8).

Targeting the entry route of SARS-CoV-2 has been particularly challenging because
there appear to be at least two different pathways for virus entry into cells (1). SARSCoV-2 entry is mediated by the virus spike protein (9-11) and requires the receptor
ACE2 in the host cell (1, 12, 13). Upon engagement of the ACE2 receptor, the spike
protein catalyzes fusion of the viral membrane envelope with a host cell membrane to
release the contents of the virus into the cytoplasm of host cells. For the spike protein
to facilitate this reaction, it must first be cleaved by a host cell protease (1, 10). This
can be accomplished by different host proteases including TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4
(14), Factor Xa (15, 16), and by cathepsins during endocytosis (1). The protease
inhibitors E-64 and camostat mesylate target cathepsin and TMPRSS2 and inhibit

SARS-CoV-2 infection (1), but their low (micromolar) affinities have made them unlikely
candidates for clinical use. Nafamostat mesylate inhibits TMPRSS2 with a high
(nanomolar) affinity (2, 6). Apilimod has been shown to function in the endosomal
pathway by inhibiting PIKfyve kinase causing a defect in viral trafficking prior to entry (3)
but how this relates to the cathepsin or TMPRSS2 protease dependent pathways has
not been investigated.

Using a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in which the attachment and fusion
glycoprotein G is replaced by the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-SARS-CoV-2)
(17) we investigate inhibition of infection in different cell types known to contain different
levels of cathepsin and TMPRSS2 proteases. We tested combinations of the protease
inhibitors E-64 (cathepsin), camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate (TMPRSS2)
and the lipid kinase inhibitor apilimod (PIKfyve kinase) on VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection of
multiple cell types. We observed a 5-fold synergistic effect in the infection of VSVSARS-CoV-2 by simultaneous inhibition of TMPRSS2 and PIKfyve kinase. Furthermore,
the synergistic inhibitory effects on infection by VSV-SARS-CoV-2 or a clinical isolate of
SARS-CoV-2 were observed with nanomolar concentrations of nafamostat mesylate
and apilimod. This finding suggests that a combination of inhibitors that target two
different host factors in the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 will likely be more effective
than targeting either alone.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
VSV-SARS2-CoV-2 infection is partially prevented by PIKfyve kinase or TMPRSS2
protease inhibitors
It has been proposed that two distinct host proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin
facilitate different SARS2-CoV-2 viral entry routes - cell surface or endosomal - and
their abundance in different cell types may influence the entry pathway (1). To test this,
we employed a panel of inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 infection in African green monkey
kidney epithelial derived VeroE6 cells poorly expressing TMPRSS2, VeroE6 cells stably
expressing ectopic TMPRSS2, as well as human colon carcinoma derived Caco-2 cells
and human lung derived Calu-3 cells naturally expressing TMPRSS2.

We first established the relative importance of the cathepsin-dependent route for
infection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 by determining the effect of the cathepsin inhibitor E-64
on expression of eGFP mediated by VSV-SARS-CoV-2. As summarized in the plots in
Fig. 1A, we found a cell type dependence in the extent of infection block with a half
maximal effective concentration (EC50) in the ~5-10 µM range. Notably, only Vero E6
cells treated with E-64 displayed a full infection block, the result expected for cells
expressing cathepsin but no TMPRSS2; in contrast, cells expressing cathepsin and
TMPRSS2 (VeroE6 + TMPRRS2, Caco-2) displayed a partial block, while Calu-3 cells
with minimal expression of cathepsin L (18) did not respond, as expected, to E-64
treatment (1).

We extended the analysis and studied the inhibitory effect by the PIKfyve kinase
inhibitor apilimod on VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1 B). We found that all cell types
shown to be sensitive to E-64 also responded to treatment with apilimod with EC50 ~ 10
nM whereas Calu-3, which is insensitive to E-64 (19), did not respond. Although
apilimod doesn’t inhibit cathepsin B or L (20), these observations are consistent with
potential modulation of the endosomal availability of cathepsin by the activity of PIKfyve
kinase (21, 22).

A similar analysis, to document the reduction of viral infection using camostat mesylate
to block the protease activity of TPMRSS2 (Fig. 1C) or nafamostat mesylate (Fig. 1D)
showed, as anticipated, no response in Vero E6 cells lacking TMPRSS2, partial
inhibition in Vero E6 or Caco-2 cells expressing TMPRSS2 or full inhibition in Calu-3
cells naturally expressing TMPRSS2 but insensitive to cathepsin inhibition.

These observations are consistent with previous results (1, 2, 6, 19) that infection by
VSV-SARS-CoV-2 occurred through two complementary entry pathways with different
importance depending on the cell type, one depending on the proteolytic activity of
cathepsin and the second relying of the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2. As a negative
control for these experiments, we included infection by the parental VSV (Fig. 1E),
whose ability to infect host cells is known to be independent of the enzymatic activities
of cathepsin, TMPRSS2, or PIKfyve kinase (1-4, 6). As expected, none of the inhibitors
for these enzymes influenced the extent of VSV infectivity in any of the cells used. From

these results we could also exclude potential cytotoxic effects by the compounds in the
concentration range used.

Synergistic prevention of VSV-SARS2-CoV-2 infection by combined use of
PIKfyve kinase and TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors
Since the cathepsin and TMPRSS2-dependent activation of SARS-CoV-2 correspond to
complementary entry pathways thought to act independent of each other, we expected
an additive inhibitory effect upon their simultaneous inhibition in cells that express both
proteases. Indeed, VSV-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells expressing cathepsin and
TMPRSS2 (VeroE6 +TMPRSS2) was equally inhibited (EC50 ~ 2 µM) by camostat
mesylate in the absence or increasing concentrations of E-64 up to 20 µM, the
concentration at which E-64 maximally blocked VSV-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2A). We used
SynergyFinder 2.0 (23) to compare the combined response obtained experimentally
with the expected outcome calculated by the Bliss synergy-scoring model. Using this
reference model, that considers multiplicative effect of single drugs as if they acted
independently (23, 24), we obtained a d-score of 6 indicative of an additive interaction
between camostat and E-64.

Combined use of apilimod and camostat mesylate led to enhanced inhibition of VSVCoV-2 infection with a ~ 2 fold decrease in the EC50 of camostat mesylate (from 1 to 0.4
µM) (Fig. 2B). Notably, a stronger ~ 5 fold decrease in the EC50 from 1 uM to 0.2 uM
(Fig. 2C) was observed in Calu-3 cells deficient in the cathepsin-dependent infection
route (18) known to be insensitive to E-64 (Fig. 1A) and apilimod (Fig. 1B) (19, 25, 26).

The simultaneous use of variable amounts of apilimod and nafamostat mesylate,
another inhibitor of TMPRSS2, also displayed enhanced infection inhibition with a ~ 20fold decrease of EC50 for nafamostat mesylate from 0.02 to 0.001 µM (Fig. 3A, central
panel). Simultaneous treatment with apilimod and increasing amounts of nafamostat
mesylate led to an analogous enhanced potency of apilimod inhibition with a ~10-fold
decrease of EC50 from 0.01 to 0.001 µM (Fig. 3A, right panel). Formal evaluation for
synergism using the Bliss reference model was consistent with a synergy d-score of 41
(a score greater than 10 indicates synergy (23)).

Comparable strong synergistic effects (d-score of 34) by combined use of apilimod and
nafamostat mesylate were observed in Vero E6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3B,
central and right panels) infected with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 D614G whose spike S protein
includes the point mutation known to increase infectivity of the native SARS-CoV-2 (27).
While this mutation has no effect on the virus entry mechanism or sensitivity to
proteases, it stabilizes the stalk region of the spike, which otherwise tend to fall apart
after furin cleavage between S1 and S2 (27-30).

Taken together, these synergistic results highlight the unexpected non-additive
involvement of PIKfyve kinase activity for the functional effectiveness of TMPRSS2 to
mediate viral entry along the TMPRSS2 route.

Synergistic prevention of SARS2-CoV-2 infection by combined use of PIKfyve
kinase and TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors
To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 virus also display an enhanced block of infection
upon combined use of apilimod and camostat mesylate we infected Caco-2 cells
ectopically expressing hACE2, the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This cell line was
created as a way to enhance the susceptibility of Caco-2 to infection by SARS-CoV-2
since the parental cells express low endogenous levels of ACE2 (31); successful
infection was scored 18 hrs post infection by the appearance of viral N protein using
immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4, left panel). The inhibitory EC50 of camostat
mesylate decreased ~ 6 fold from 0.6 to 0.1 µM when used together with apilimod, (Fig.
4, right panel). This observation extends our results from VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeras to
SARS-CoV-2 virus, and illustrates that combined chemical inhibition of PIKfyve kinase
and TMPRSS2 protease activities is likely to also prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection with
strong synergism.

Final remarks
According to our present understanding of early steps necessary for successful
infection, SARS-CoV-2 would enter cells using two main redundant routes, each
requiring cleavage of the viral S spike protein, one dependent on the proteolytic
activities of members of the cathepsin family, the other requiring proteolysis by
TMPRSS2 or similar transmembrane-serine proteases. Expression level of these
proteases depends on cell type and hence their relative importance to support
successful infection would hinge in part on their relative expression. Cathepsin is

primarily found in late endosomes or lysosomes and requires low pH for optimal
enzymatic activity; for these reasons it has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 entry
occurs from the endolysosomal compartment (32, 33). In contrast, TMPRSS2 is thought
to be at the cell surface (34) and its optimal proteolytic activity is pH independent (35);
hence it has been inferred that TMPRSS2 cleavage of spike S protein occurs on virions
at the plasma membrane from which viral entry is then assumed to occur (1).

Not surprising for protease inhibitors with different targets, combined inhibition of the
enzymatic activities of cathepsin and TMPRSS2 by the respective protease inhibitors E64 and camostat mesylate led to additive prevention of infection by
SARS-CoV-2 (1) and by the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimera (this study).

Apilimod specifically inhibits PIKfyve kinase thereby preventing its ability to generate
PI(3,5)P2, a key phosphoinositide required to modulate the function of a number of
proteins involved in late endosomal traffic (3, 21, 36, 37). While it is now well
established that interference with PIKfyve kinase prevents infection of a selected group
of viruses including, Ebola (20) and VSV-Ebola (3), Marburg (20), VSV-SARS-CoV-2 (3)
and native SARS-CoV-2 (3-5), the molecular mechanism responsible for the
interference remains to be determined. Apilimod demonstrated anti-Ebola infection
synergy with clomiphene cytrate (d-score of 23.8; re-calculated from data in Fig. 1B of
(38) using the Bliss reference model (23)) and with other drugs that interfere by
unknown mechanisms with Ebola entry in late endosomes (38).

The strong synergism we described in the laboratory setting for single cell types upon
combined use of the PIKfyve kinase and TMPRSS2 inhibitors highlights the potential
clinical advantage of using a similar strategy to ameliorate the viral load and potentially
reduce the risk to COVID-19 in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on
simultaneous inhibition of these enzymes. Variants of apilimod and camostat rendered
more soluble by mesylate modification are orally administered inhibitors presently under
clinical trial dispensed alone for various ailments including COVID-19 (7, 39, 40). More
soluble nafamostat mesylate has been administered intravenously to treat COVID-19
patients (8). We presently don’t know how efficiently these inhibitors could reach the
nasopharyngeal and lung tissues; nevertheless, we surmise that combined use in
individuals of these PIKfyve and TMPRSS2 inhibitors might also manifest ~5-10 fold
increase in inhibitor efficiency in the relevant target cells similar to that observed in the
laboratory setting, and hence be advantageous for treatment.

Generation of recombinant VSV (Indiana serotype) expressing eGFP (VSV-eGFP) and
VSV-eGFP chimeras whose glycoprotein G was replaced with either the wild type spike
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) or with the point
mutant D614G (VSV-SARS-CoV-2 D614G) was done as described (17). Briefly, VSV
was grown by infection of BSRT7/5 and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeras were grown by
infection of MA104 cells. Cells were grown in 12-18 150 mm dishes and infected at an
MOI of 0.01. Virus-containing supernatant was collected at 48 hours post infection. The
supernatant was clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 1,000 ´ g for 10 min at room
temp. An initial pellet of virus and extracellular particles was generated by centrifugation
in a Ti45 fixed-angle rotor at 30,000 ´ g (25,000 rpm) for 2 hours at 4°C. The pellet was
resuspended overnight in 1X NTE (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA)
at 4°C. The resuspended pellet was layered on top of a 15% sucrose-NTE cushion and
subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Sw55 swinging bucket rotor at 110,000 ´ g (35,000
rpm) for 2 hours at 4°C. The supernatant was aspirated and virus pellet resuspended in
1X NTE overnight at 4°C. The resuspended virus pellet was separated on a 15-45%
sucrose-NTE gradient by ultracentrifugation in a SW55 swinging bucket rotor at 150,000
´ g (40,000 rpm) for 1.5 hours at 4°C. The predominant light-scattering virus band was
observed in the lower third of the gradient and was extracted by side puncture of the
gradient tube. Extracted virus was diluted in 1X NTE and collected by ultracentrifugation
in a Ti60 fixed-angle rotor at 115,000 ´ g (40,000 rpm) for 2 hours at 4°C. The final
pellet was re-suspended overnight in 1X NTE in a volume of 0.2 to 0.5 mL depending
on the size of the pellet and stored at 4°C for use in subsequent imaging experiments.

Isolation and propagation of SARS-CoV-2
Human samples were obtained under the Helsinki University Hospital laboratory
research permit 30 HUS/32/2018 § 16. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19
Briefly, a nasopharyngeal swab in 500 µl of Copan UTM® Universal Transport Medium
was inoculated on Calu-3 cells (P1) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, after which the
inoculum was removed and replaced with Minimum Essential Medium supplemented
with 2% FBS, L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. Virus replication was determined
by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RdRP (41), and the infectious virus collected 48h after
inoculation. The P1 stock was propagated once (P2) in VeroE6+TMPRSS2, sequenced
and stored at -80 °C. Virus stocks were stored in DMEM, 2% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine,
1% penicillin-streptomycin.

Cell Culture
VeroE6 (ATCC CRL-1586), Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37), and Calu-3 cells (ATCC HTB-55)
were purchased from ATTC. VeroE6+TMPRSS2 cells were a gift from Siyan Ding (14).
VeroE6, VeroE6+TMPRSS2, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. VeroE6 and
VeroE6+TMPRSS2 cells were grown at 37oC and 5% CO2 and split at a ratio of 1:10
every 3-4 days when cells were at ~90% confluency. Caco-2 cells were grown at 37oC
and 5% CO2 and split at a ratio of 1:5 every 3-4 days when cells were at ~95%
confluency. Calu-3 cells were grown at 37oC and 7% CO2 and split at a ratio of 1:3
every 5-6 days when cells were at ~95% confluency. BSR-T7 cells were derived from

BHC cells (42) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. BSR-T7 were grown at 37oC and 5% CO2 and split at a ratio of 1:20 every
2-3 days when cells were at ~90% confluency. MA104 cells (ATCC, CRL-2378.1) were
grown in Media 199 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
MA104 cells were grown at 37oC and 5% CO2 and split at a ratio of 1:3 every 2 days
when cells were at ~90% confluency. The media was changed in all cell types every 2
days and regularly tested for presence of mycoplasma.

Caco-2 cells stably expressing human ACE2 were generated by transduction with third
generation lentivirus pLenti7.3/V5 DEST ACE2-EmGFP (prepared by the cloning facility
Dream-Lab, Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; the
expression of Emerald GFP is driven by the SV40 promoter. Cells expressing eGFP
were isolated by FACS. Cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were kept at
37oC, 5% CO2, and split ever 2-4 days when ~90% confluent.

Infection protocol for VSV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2
Polydimethylsiloxane was cured by vigorously mixing with curing reagent at a ratio of 1
to 10. PDMS was poured into 10 cm petri dish (5 g of PDMS per plate) and incubated
at 90 oC for ~4 hours. Plates were removed and stored at room temperature until use.
PDMS was removed from petri dish using a razor blade. 3 mm holes were punched into
PDMS which was cut with a blade to be ~6-10 mm. Glass slides were cleaned by
sonication first in isopropanol for 20 min then in 0.5M potassium hydroxide for 20 min

followed by extensive washing in Milli-q water. Glass was dried in an oven 60 oC for 30
minutes then bonded to the PDMS by exposing PDMS and glass to air plasma at 750
mTorr, 30 W for 2 minutes using a PDC-001 plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma) then
firmly pressing glass and PDMS together. This was followed by placing bonded glass
and PDMS in an oven at 90 oC for 20 minutes. The glass cover slips mounted with a
PDMS well were then placed in 70% ethanol for 10 minutes to sterilize prior to use for
cell culture.

The day prior to the experiment cells were plated in PDMS wells on the glass slide
stored in a 6 well plate at a density to achieve ~70% confluence the day of the
experiment. On the day of the experiment cells were incubated with the desired
inhibitor concentration for 1 hour. Media was then removed and virus that had been
diluted into media containing the indicated inhibitor concentration was added to the well
in a volume of 10 µL. Media was left in the 6 well plate outside of the PDMS well at a
level less than the height of the PDMS well to maintain humidity and prevent
evaporation. After the virus was incubated with the cells for 1 hour the cells were
washed with media containing the indicated inhibitor and then the well was filled with
fresh media. At 6 hours after initiating the infection with VSV or 8 hours after initiating
the infection with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 media was removed and the cells were stained by
adding 5µg/mL WGA-Alexa647 in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2
mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 30 seconds at room temperature. Cells were then washed
with sterile PBS 2 times and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. In all
experiment’s cells were kept at 37oC and 5% (for Vero, Vero+TMRPSS2, and Caco-2

cells) or 7% CO2 (for Calu-3 cells) and media was pre warmed to 37oC. Infected cells
were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope with a 40X oil objective with a
pixel size of 0.33 µm where 20 optical planes were taken at 0.5 µm apart for every field
of view (43). Cells were considered infected when they displayed a cytosolic
fluorescence signal from eGFP with a relative intensity of 1.4 times that of the
background of uninfected cells. Example images are max intensity projections of the cell
volume where the outline (white) line was obtained by tracing the WGA-Alexa647 signal
outlining the cell.

Infection protocol for SARS-CoV-2
All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed in BSL3 facilities at the University of
Helsinki with appropriate institutional permits. Virus samples were obtained under the
Helsinki University Hospital laboratory research permit 30 HUS/32/2018 § 16. Virus titers
were determined by plaque assay in VeroE6+TMPRSS2 cells. Cells in DMEM,
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, pen/strep, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2 were
seeded 48 h before treatment at a density of 15,000 cells per well in 96-well imaging
plates (PerkinElmer cat. 6005182). Inhibitors, or DMSO control, were either added 60 min
prior to infection, or added 90 min post infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.5
plaque forming units per cell. Infections were carried for 20 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells
were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature before
being processed for immuno-detection of viral N protein, automated fluorescence imaging
and image analysis. Briefly, viral NP was detected with an in house developed rabbit
polyclonal antibody (31) counterstained with Alexa-647-conjugated goat anti rabbit

secondary antibody, and nuclear staining done using Hoechst DNA dye. Automated
fluorescence imaging was done using an epifluorescence high-content Molecular Device
Image-Xpress Nano microscope equipped with a 20x objective and a 4.7Mpixel CMOS
camera (pixel size 0.332 µm). Image analysis was performed with the software
CellProfiler-3 (www.cellprofiler.org). Automated detection of nuclei was obtained using
the Otsu algorithm inbuilt in the software. To automatically identify infected cells, an area
surrounding each nucleus (5 pixels expansion of the nuclear area) was used to estimate
the fluorescence intensity of the viral NP immuno labeled protein, using an intensity
threshold such that less than 0.01% of positive cells were detected in non-infected wells.

Statistical analysis
The significance of response (synergy d-score) upon combined use of two drugs (Fig. 3)
was calculated using the Bliss reference model for combination of two drugs incorporated
in the stand-alone web-application SynergyFind v2 (23). This model assumes a stochastic
process in which the effects of two drugs act independently. d-score values between -10
and 10 suggest an additive interaction; d-scores larger than 10 suggest the interaction is
synergistic.

For statistical analysis of the data in Figures 2 B, C and Figure 4 each replicate titration
was fitted separately using IgorPro to determine the EC550 for each experiment. These
replicate EC50 values were then used in an unpaired T-test to determine the significance
difference in the values of the shift in affinities of the dose response of camostat mesylate
caused by apilimod.
