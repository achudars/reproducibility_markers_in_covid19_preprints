adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
ABSTRACT
Poly-ADP-ribose
polymerase
(PARP)
superfamily members covalently link either a
single ADP-ribose (ADPR) or a chain of
ADPR units to proteins using nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as the source of
ADPR. While the well-known poly-ADPribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily
function in the DNA damage response, many
non-canonical
mono-ADP-ribosylating
(MARylating) PARPs are associated with
cellular antiviral responses. We recently
demonstrated robust upregulation of several
PARPs following infection with Murine
Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus.
Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection
strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs
and induces the expression of genes encoding
enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from
nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide
riboside (NR), while downregulating other
NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that
overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to

depress cellular NAD and that the activities of
the transcriptionally induced enzymes
PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are
limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced
by pharmacological activation of NAD
synthesis. We further demonstrate that
infection with MHV induces a severe attack
on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally, we
show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR
dramatically decrease the replication of an
MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity.
These data suggest that the antiviral activities
of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are
limited by the availability of NAD, and that
nutritional and pharmacological interventions
to enhance NAD levels may boost innate
immunity to coronaviruses.

Disease attributed to the current novel
coronavirus (CoV) outbreak (COVID-19) has
rapidly spread globally, infecting more than 33
million people and killing more than a million as

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

of late September, 2020 (1). The causative agent,
severe
acquired
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is transmitted
largely by aerosol and liquid droplets that infect
cells of the lung epithelium (2). Severe disease is
thought to proceed through a combination of
robust viral replication and a cytokine storm in
which host inflammation damages multiple
organ systems. While many therapeutic
approaches are under investigation, the
evidence-basis for effective prevention and
treatment agents remains limited.
CoV genomes do not encode enzymes
needed for ATP generation, nucleotide, amino
acid, lipid or protein synthesis, and therefore
depend on exploitation of host functions to
synthesize and assemble virus (3-5). Cellular and
viral energy generation and biosynthetic
programs depend on the four nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) coenzymes, NAD+,
NADH, NADP+ and NADPH, which are the
central catalysts of metabolism (6). These
coenzymes accept and donate electrons in
essential, ubiquitous processes of fuel oxidation,
lipid, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis,
and the generation and detoxification of reactive
oxygen species. The specific roles of these
coenzymes in viral replication and antiviral
defenses are largely unexplored.
Several members of the PARP
superfamily are interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs) that have been implicated in restriction
of viral replication through mechanisms that are
not well understood (7,8). With the exception of
the enzymatically inactive PARP13 protein,
PARP isozymes have an absolute requirement
for NAD+ (9,10). However, rather than using
NAD+ as an electron acceptor, PARPs use NAD+
as an ADPR donor in protein modification
reactions (6). The canonical and best
characterized PARP isozymes, PARP1 and
PARP2, form PAR largely in response to DNA
damage. However, most other members of the
PARP
superfamily
exhibit
MARylation
activities on target proteins (9). We previously
showed that MHV infection strongly induces
expression of noncanonical PARP isozymes
PARP7, PARP9, PARP10, PARP11, PARP12,
PARP13 and PARP14 (11). To determine
whether these gene expression changes are
incidental to MHV infection, facilitate MHV
infection, or are part of an innate immune
response against MHV, we treated cells with
siRNAs to knock down expression of these

genes and then analyzed the impact on MHV
replication. Our data showed that PARP7 plays a
role in facilitating replication. In contrast,
PARP14 is required for full induction of
interferon
(IFN)-β
expression
(11,12),
suggesting that PARP14 is directly involved in
establishing the innate immune response in
CoV-infected cells.
Most CoV genomes encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) (3-5). Nsp3 contains a
macrodomain, herein termed the CoV ADPR
hydrolase (CARH) that removes ADPR
modifications from acidic amino acids on
protein targets. Thus, CARH reverses the
modification that is installed by the IFN-induced
activities of MARylating PARP isozymes (13).
CARH activity is required for virulence in vivo
using mouse models of both MHV and SARSCoV (13-15). Moreover, an active site mutation
that ablates CARH activity in MHV resulted in a
virus that replicates poorly in primary bonemarrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) (11).
We further identified PARP12 and PARP14 as
CoV-induced ISGs that are required for
depressed replication of CARH mutant viruses,
indicating that their activity is opposed by
CARH-mediated reversal of MARylation (11).
In support of the antiviral roles of
MARylating PARP isozymes, PARP12 was
shown to promote degradation of nsp1 and nsp3
in Zika virus infection (16). PARP12 has also
been shown to inhibit a wide variety of RNA
viruses, including several alphaviruses, which
also contain nsp3-encoded ADPR hydrolase
activities (17,18). These observations suggest
that key events in the innate immune response to
viral infections are played out in the infected
cell’s NAD metabolome.
To determine whether the dramatic
upregulation of PARPs seen following MHV
infection is conserved among CoVs and also
whether cellular infection by CoVs disturbs
NAD homeostasis, we analyzed transcriptomic
data from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cell
lines and organoids, SARS-CoV-2-infected
ferrets, a lung biopsy from people living with or
dead from COVID-19, and bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) from healthy individuals as
well as those infected with COVID-19. These
data indicate that the same noncanonical PARPs
induced by MHV are induced by SARS-CoV-2
and that in vivo infection with SARS-CoV-2
down-regulates synthesis of NAD from

tryptophan and nicotinic acid (NA) while upregulating synthesis capacity from NAM and
NR. We further show that disturbances to the
NAD transcriptome scale with viral load.
Though noncanonical PARP isozymes are
known to use NAD+ to MARylate target
proteins, it had not been reported that expression
of these enzymes can drive down cellular NAD+.
Here we show that PARP10 overexpression is
sufficient to depress cellular NAD+ and that the
MARylating activities of PARP10, PARP12 and
PARP14 can be pharmacologically increased by
enhancing NAD salvage synthesis with SBI797812 (SBI), a NAMPT activator (19).
Though the essentiality of CARH for
viral pathogenesis argues for cellular NAD and
noncanonical PARP induction as antiviral, it
remained conceivable that a depressed cellular
NAD metabolome is an adaptive antiviral
response to restrict viral biosynthetic processes.
We therefore established a cellular system to test
whether increased NAD status opposes MHV
infection. Consistent with our transcriptomic
analysis that CoV infection downregulates NA
salvage and upregulates NAM and NR salvage,
we found, using an MHV mutant virus sensitive
to PARP activity, that NA minimally inhibited
viral replication, while NAM, SBI and a
clinically tested preparation of NR (Niagen)(2022) strongly inhibit MHV replication. The data
justify further analysis of how nutritional and
therapeutic modulation of NAD status may
potentially restrict viral infection by boosting
PARP activity.
RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Human Lung Systems
Induces a Noncanonical PARP Isozyme
Transcriptional Program
MHV infection in murine BMDMs
launches a transcriptional program that induces
transcription of noncanonical PARP isozymes
PARP7, PARP9, PARP10, PARP11, PARP12,
PARP13 and PARP14 by > 5-fold (11,12). To
determine
whether
SARS-CoV-2
also
dysregulates the NAD system upon infection, we
assembled and analyzed a set of 71 genes that
encode the enzymes responsible for conversion
of tryptophan, NA, NAM, and NR to NAD+,
plus the enzymes responsible for NAD(H)
phosphorylation, NADP(H) dephosphorylation,
NAD+-dependent deacylation, MARylation,
PARylation,
cADP-ribose
formation,

nicotinamide methylation/oxidation, and other
related functions in transport, binding, redox and
regulation (Supplementary Material 1). We
then analyzed RNAseq data from SARS-CoV-2
infection of three human lung cell lines, Calu-3,
normal human bronchial epithelia (NHBE), and
A549 (Fig. 1A-C) (23). Calu-3 cells exhibit the
most robust response, inducing PARP7, PARP9,
PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 more than 4fold as well as PARP3, PARP4, PARP5a,
PARP5b and PARP8 to a lesser but statistically
significant degree (Fig. 1A). In NHBE cells,
SARS-CoV-2 induces transcription of PARP9,
PARP12 and PARP14, while in A549 cells it
induces PARP9, PARP10, PARP12 and
PARP14, with lesser effects on PARP7 and
PARP13 (Fig. 1B-C).

Dysregulation

of

NAD

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2
entry (24). To determine the effect of
overexpression of ACE2 or greater viral
exposure on the NAD transcriptome, we
compared high quality RNAseq data from
control or ACE2-overexpressing A549 cells
infected at low (0.2) or high (2) multiplicity of
infection (MOI). Greater viral exposure
dysregulated more NAD related genes (Fig. 1DF). The viral load-dependent changes came in
three types. First, PARP7 is strongly dependent
on viral load, being minimally induced in A549
cells infected at a low MOI (Fig 1C). However,
in cells expressing ACE2 or infected at high
MOI, PARP7 was one of the most highly
induced PARP isozymes (Fig. 1D-F). Second, as
ACE2 or more virus was added, transcription of
more PARP isozymes was disturbed. ACE2 and
higher MOI both downregulated expression of
PARP1 while they upregulated expression of 12
of the other 16 PARP superfamily members
(Fig. 1F). Third, on the basis of transcriptional
changes, viral infection alters expression of
NAD biosynthesis pathways. ACE2 and higher
MOI both downregulated expression of QPRT,
which is required for the conversion of
quinolinate to nicotinic acid mononucleotide in
the de novo biosynthetic pathway that originates
with tryptophan. Similarly, NADSYN, which is
required for synthesis of NAD from both
tryptophan and NA is down-regulated by viral
infection, suggesting that CoV infection might
disadvantage repletion of the NAD metabolome
from either tryptophan or NA. In contrast,

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

NAMPT, which is required for NAD synthesis
from NAM, was consistently upregulated in
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and NMRK1,
which is required for NAD synthesis from NR,
was up-regulated when cells were infected at
high MOI. In addition, the normally minimally
expressed NR kinase gene, NMRK2, was
upregulated in the ACE2 overexpressing cells
infected at high MOI.
Primary 3-D cell culture and in vivo SARS-CoV2 Infection Disturb Noncanonical PARP Isozyme
Expression and NAD Biosynthesis
Based on the finding that SARS-CoV-2
infects gut enterocytes, we analyzed RNAseq
data obtained from infected enterocyte organoids
(25). Similar to the lung cell lines and to the
transcriptional effect of MHV infection,
enterocyte organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2
induce PARP9, PARP12 and PARP14 (Fig. 2A).
Ferrets have been shown to be
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection (26) and
are being used as a system to probe host
responses as well as potential preventative and
therapeutic agents. To determine if PARP
upregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection
is also observed in vivo, we probed high-quality
RNAseq data from the tracheas of mock and 3day SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets (23) and
found that the noncanonical PARP induction
program is conserved in this relevant animal
model (Fig. 2B). Specifically, PARP4, PARP5,
PARP9, PARP13, PARP14 and PARP15 were
all > 4-fold induced with significant but lesser
induction of PARP7 and PARP11. In ferret
tracheas, we observed other significant
alterations to the NAD gene set. The data
indicate that transcription of NMRK1 and
concentrative nucleoside transporter CNT3 are
induced in response to CoV infection, suggesting
increased capacity for uptake and conversion of
NR to NAD+ and NADP+ (27). Notably, in
mouse models of damaged brain and heart,
upregulation of NMRK gene expression is
associated with therapeutic efficacy of NR
(28,29). Additionally, the ferret data show
strongly depressed NNMT expression—by
decreasing NAM methylation, this gene
expression change could promote NAM salvage
(30) and the efficiency of NAD-boosting by NR
or NAMPT activators (20), representing a
homeostatic attempt of virally infected cells to
maintain their NAD metabolome (31).

COVID-19 Patient Samples Recapitulate the
PARP Induction Program Seen in Ferrets and In
Vitro
Finally, though ferrets are susceptible
to infection by SARS-CoV-2, they do not
progress to the serious disease seen in humans
(26). We therefore examined the NAD gene set
in RNAseq data from the lung of an individual
who died of COVID-19 (23). Though lacking
the replicates and the synchrony of the ferret
RNAseq data, the human data showed that
PARP9, PARP11 and PARP13 were upregulated
in the deceased individual’s lung (Fig. 2C).
Finally, we analyzed RNA-seq data
obtained from the BALF of 430 SARS-CoV-2
infected people and 54 controls (32). Consistent
with previous findings, PARP9 was upregulated
nearly 4-fold while PARP12 and PARP14 were
upregulated more that 2-fold (Fig. 2D).
Notably, NAD biosynthetic gene
changes were conserved in vivo with NAMPT
and NMRK1 gene expression increased by viral
infection in ferrets, and NAMPT increased in the
human patient samples. Further data on
transcriptomic alterations to NAD synthesis in
all nine data sets are provided in
Supplementary Material 12.
PARP10 Overexpression is Sufficient to Depress
NAD+ Levels
It is well known that PARP1 activation
by DNA damage greatly increases its catalytic
activity, leading to depression of cellular NAD+
and ATP (9,10). It is less clear whether
transcriptional induction of the MARylating
enzymes such as PARP10 that are induced
substantially by viruses including SARS-CoV-2
might disturb cellular NAD+. To test whether
overexpression of a MARylating enzyme is
sufficient to disturb the NAD metabolome, we
performed targeted quantitative NAD analysis
with LC-MS/MS using internal 13C standards
(33) on HEK 293T cells expressing either GFP
or a GFP-PARP10 fusion. We found that
overexpression of GFP-PARP10 significantly
depressed NAD+ compared to overexpression of
GFP alone (Fig. 3A). We next determined if the
PARP10-mediated loss in NAD+ could be
restored by increasing cytosolic NAD+ synthesis
with SBI, a small molecule activator of NAMPT,
which promotes NAM salvage (19). SBI
increased steady-state levels of NAD+ in GFPexpressing cells, but did not significantly boost

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

NAD+ in PARP10-expressing cells, indicating
that PARP10 expression is sufficient to limit
cellular NAD+ (Fig. 3A).
Enhanced NAD Salvage Increases the Activity of
PARP Isozymes Induced by MHV & SARS-CoV2 infection
The ability of SBI to elevate cellular
NAD+ in GFP-expressing cells but not in
PARP10-expressing cells suggested that
overexpressed PARP isozymes are active at
lower levels of cellular NAD+ but left open the
question of whether overexpressed PARP
isozymes have enzymatic activities that are
limited by the depressed NAD+ status that they
confer. To determine whether the activity of
PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 can be
increased by NAMPT stimulation, we measured
ADPR-modified protein levels by western blot
in HEK 293T cells overexpressing GFP, or GFPtagged PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 or PARP14
in the presence or absence of SBI. Consistent
with the ability of SBI treatment to elevate
cellular NAD+, SBI enhanced PARP1
autoPARylating activity in GFP-expressing
cells. SBI treatment resulted in a striking
increase in PARP10 activity as evidenced by
enhanced PARP10 autoMARylation. A similar
result was observed with PARP7 and PARP12
albeit to a lesser degree. Finally, SBI treatment
of PARP14-expressing cells resulted in a
significant increase in PARP14 target
MARylation (auto-MARylation was not detected
under these conditions) (Fig. 3B). These results
indicate that activities of overexpressed PARP
isozymes are limited by cellular NAD+ levels
and can be enhanced pharmacologically.
MHV Infection Drives Down Cellular NAD+ and
NADP+ in Infected Cells
Given that CoVs consistently induce
members of the PARP superfamily at the mRNA
level, we asked whether MHV infection alters
the NAD metabolome. MHV is a model CoV
that can be propagated under BSL-2 conditions,
allowing us to obtain samples needed for
quantitative analysis of the NAD metabolome.
We infected delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells
with MHV-A59 at a MOI of 3 and subjected the
cells to quantitative targeted NAD metabolomics
12 hours after infection (33). Infection led to a >
3-fold depression of cellular NAD+ and NADP+
with respect to control after a mock infection
(Fig. 4A). To address the possibility that these
effects are specific to a cancer cell line and not a

primary viral target cell population, we prepared
bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM)
from C57BL/6 mice and infected them with
MHV-A59 at a MOI of 3. Similar to DBT cells,
we observed a greater than 3-fold depression of
cellular NAD+ and NADP+ with respect to
control cells at 12 hours (Fig. 4B). Thus, in
primary cells that represent an authentic CoV
target cell population, MHV depresses levels of
NAD coenzymes.
NAD
Boosting
Compounds
Replication of a CARH-mutant MHV

Decrease

We previously reported that the CARH
domain of MHV and SARS-CoV Nsp3 proteins
is required for maximum replication and
pathogenesis in vivo (13-15). Moreover, the
N1347A active site mutation that ablates the
ADPR hydrolase activity of CARH and in vivo
infectivity of MHV also resulted in a virus that
replicates poorly in primary BMDM cells but
reaches similar peak titers as WT virus in a
transformed 17Cl-1 fibroblast cell line (11,14).
These data suggest that a CARH inhibitor would
be completely antiviral in vivo and would show
some activity in dampening replication in
cellular infection models.
Our data established that noncanonical
PARPs are consistently induced by CoV
infection (Figs. 1-2); can depress cellular NAD+
and have their MARylation activities limited by
cellular NAD+ (Fig. 3); and have known
antiviral activities (16-18). These data suggest
that boosting cellular NAD through the
transcriptionally upregulated NAMPT and
NMRK pathways would have antiviral activity.
However, it remained a possibility that the antiviral response of infected cells evolved to drive
down cellular NAD+ and NADP+ in order to rob
invading viruses of biosynthetic capacity.
To test the hypothesis that NADboosting interventions would depress viral
replication in sensitive cellular assays, we
measured MHV N1347A infection of BMDM
and 17Cl-1 systems as a function of addition of
NA, NAM, SBI or NR (Niagen) (Fig. 5A). As
previously reported, N1347A reached similar
peak titers as WT virus in 17Cl-1 cells.
However, the addition of NA, NAM, SBI and
NR all significantly decreased its replication
(Fig. 5B). Consistent with increased NAMPT
and NMRK gene expression and depressed
NADSYN expression in SARS-CoV-2 -infected
cells (Fig. 1-2), NAM, SBI and NR had

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

significantly greater effects on N1347A
replication than NA. NAM, SBI and NR
decreased N1347A replication by 8.3, 4.4, and
6.4 fold respectively, while NA decreased its
replication by only 1.9 fold (Fig. 5B, Table 1).
Consistent with the permissivity of 17Cl-1 cells
to infection (11,14), these treatments did not
affect WT virus replication in 17Cl-1 cells.
Next we tested the ability of NR to
reduce N1347A replication in BMDM cells.
Here, N1347A with no treatments had a
replication defect of 4.8-fold compared to WT
virus, similar to our previous report (11).
Consistent with the view that higher NAD+
status depresses viral infectivity in cellular
assays, addition of NR to cultures infected by
N1347A further depressed replication by 2.7fold (Fig. 5C, Table 1).
Our data indicate that: i) CoV infection
initiates the expression of multiple noncanonical
PARP isozymes and dysregulates other genes
involved in NAD metabolism; ii) CoV infection
and PARP10 expression can dramatically
decrease NAD+ accumulation; and iii) NAD+
boosting agents can improve PARP isozyme
function and decrease the replication of a CoV
that is sensitive to MARylating activities.
DISCUSSION
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious
agent that constitutes a severe threat to public
health (2). Morbidity and mortality data make it
clear that age, smoking status and multiple
preexisting conditions greatly increase the
frequency of serious illness and death (34).
There is an abundance of data from model
systems and humans that age and conditions of
metabolic stress including obesity and type 2
diabetes (35), smoking (36), heart failure (29),
nerve damage (37) and central brain injury (28)
challenge the NAD system in affected tissues.
Though PARP1 was known to be a significant
consumer of NAD+, we showed that
noncanonical PARP isozymes are consistently
upregulated by CoV infections, that PARP10
overexpression can depress the NAD
metabolome, and that four noncanonical PARP
isozymes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2 have
MARylating activities that are limited by
cellular NAD status. In addition, the NAD
metabolome was depressed by MHV infection.
While the degree of depression of the NAD
metabolome is surely sensitive to time and MOI,
the >3-fold depression seen in this study is

precedented in human immunodeficiency virus
and Herpes virus infections (38,39).
Though the genetic requirement for
CARH for viral replication in vivo (11,13-15)
strongly suggested that higher NAD+ status
would be protective, it was also conceivable that
PARP-mediated cellular repression of the NAD
metabolome constituted a mechanism for cells to
deprive the virus of anabolic capacity. However,
here we showed that boosting NAD+ through the
NR and NAMPT pathways depresses replication
in a CARH-mutant cellular infection model with
no effect on replication of wild-type virus.
Further experiments will be required to identify
the key MARylated targets that are potentially
enhanced by NAD-boosting and reversed by
CARH activities.
Based on gene expression data in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1-2),
NAD boosting approaches involving increased
de novo or NA-dependent synthesis are unlikely
to be strongly effective because they require
expression of genes such as QPRT, NADSYN
and NAPRT (40) that are depressed by SARSCoV-2 infection. Consistent with gene
expression changes, in the cellular infection
system, we showed that addition of NA only
modestly reduced virus replication (Fig. 5B-C,
Table 1).
Based on gene expression data as well
as MHV cellular infection data, NAM, NAMPT
activators and NR have similar potential to be
strongly protective in vivo. However, there are a
few caveats. First, that at pharmacological doses,
NAM has the potential to function as a PARP
inhibitor (41). Second, NAMPT is considered a
driver of pulmonary vascular remodeling and
potentially a target to be inhibited to maintain
lung health of some people at risk for COVID19 (42). Thus, in order to maximize the
likelihood of success in human CoV prevention
and treatment trials, care should be taken to
carefully compare efficacy and dose-dependence
of NR, SBI and NAM with respect to control of
cytokine storm and antiviral activities in vivo.
The cellular results presented herein
warrant the testing of NAD boosting agents in
the context of in vivo CoV infections. In addition
to animal trials, the safety of various forms of
vitamin B3 should allow rapid clinical
assessments of NAD boosters to be evaluated in
two placebo-controlled contexts.

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

First, we suggest that improved NAD
status could help blunt the severity of infection
by sustaining PARP-dependent IFN signaling in
the face of the self-limiting nature of cellular
NAD during infection and by limiting the storm
of inflammatory cytokines that is typically
associated with serious disease (43). In a small
placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to
address the oral safety and activity of Niagen
NR in older men, it was discovered that 1 gram
of NR per day depresses levels of IL-6, IL-5, and
IL-2 (22). Based on these findings, we suggest
that NAD boosters be tested on hospitalized and
nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients with
primary endpoints of disease recovery,
oxygenation and cytokine levels. Similar
approaches might also be tested in the context of
other viral infections that induce noncanonical
PARP isozymes and/or encode viral ADPribosylhydrolase activities (17,18).
Second, as there is no standard of care
for housemates or caretakers of infected people,
we suggest that NAD-boosting could be tested as
a placebo-controlled intervention for people in
the proximity of quarantined or hospitalized
COVID-19 individuals—the primary endpoint
would be protection against infection.
While caution should be exercised with
respect to any preventative measure, NAD
boosting approaches have the potential to
support the innate immune system and address
the age-, smoking- and comorbid conditions
associated with worse SARS-CoV-2 outcomes
(34). The potential societal benefit of a safe and
readily available molecule to support prevention
and public health is hard to overstate, especially
as new outbreaks of COVID-19 emerge.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
RNASeq analysis—Sequence counts for Fig. 1
including cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2
(strain USA-WA1/2020) were derived from
published RNAseq (GSE147507) (23). Briefly,
A549 (+/- ACE2), Calu3 and NHBE cell lines
were infected with either Mock or SARS-CoV-2
virus for 24 hours. Data for Fig. 2 were drawn
from several sources. First, expanding enterocyte
data (Fig. 2A) were obtained from
Supplementary Table 2 of (25).
Briefly,
organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an
MOI of 1 in expansion medium for 60 hr. RNA
was collected, and differential gene expression
analysis was performed using the DESeq2
package. The ferret (Fig. 2B) and deceased

human data (Fig. 2C) were also obtained from
GSE147507. Ferrets were infected with SARSCoV-2 at a PFU of 5 x 104. More information
regarding sample preparation and data
processing can be found at GEO accession
GSE147507. Finally, the human BALF data Fig.
2D were obtained from GSE152075. Briefly,
samples were obtained from nasopharyngeal
swabs of from 430 male and female individuals
with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 54 controls
(32). NHBE (Fig. 1B) and A549 (low MOI)
(Fig. 1C)
data were gathered from
Supplementary Tables 2 and 1 (23). Genes with
Status = Low or Outlier were not considered for
analysis. All other datasets where analyzed from
GEO data using DESeq2 by the UIowa
Bioinformatics Core (see Code Availability).
Genes with a p-value of zero were treated as
having a p-value equal to the next lowest p-value
in that dataset. Genes with p > 0.05 (-log(p) >
1.30) were considered statistically significant.
Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism
v8.
Cell culture—DBT, 17Cl-1, HEK293T, and
HeLa cells expressing the MHV receptor
carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion
molecule 1 (a gift from Dr. Thomas Gallagher,
Loyola University, Chicago, IL) were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), HEPES, sodium pyruvate, non-essential
amino acids, L-glutamine, penicillin and
streptomycin. To create BMDMs, bone-marrow
cells were harvested from C57BL/6 mice and
differentiated by incubating cells with 10% L929
cell supernatants and 10% FBS in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI) media for seven
days. Cells were washed and replaced with fresh
media every day after the 4th day. For analysis of
the NAD metabolome HEK293T cells were
transfected with 1µg of pEGFP-C1 Empty
Vector or pEGFP-C1-CMV-PARP10 using
CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit (Takara
Bio). 6 hours later the cells were treated with
chemical treatments in DMEM + 10% FBS at
37˚C 5% CO2 for 18h.
Mice—Animal studies were approved by the
University of Kansas Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) as directed by the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (Protocol #252-01). Anesthesia or
euthanasia
were

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and
maintained in the animal care facility at the
University of Kansas.
Virus infection—Recombinant WT (rJIA GFPrevN1347) and N1347A (rJ-IA-GFPN1347A) MHV were previously described (3).
Both viruses expressed eGFP. MHV-A59 was
previously described (44). All viruses were
propagated on 17Cl-1 as previously described
(11). DBT, 17Cl-1, and BMDM cells were
infected as described in the figure legends with a
1-hour adsorption period, before virus was
removed from the well and replaced with fresh
media. For NAD analysis, DBT cells were
washed with PBS and replenished with serumfree DMEM prior to infection with no
supplements except penicillin and streptomycin
and were maintained in serum-free media
throughout the infection. For treatments with
NAD modulating compounds, 10 μM NA,
NAM, and SBI-797812 were added immediately
following the adsorption phase. For NR
experiments, 100 nmol of NR was added to cells
in 24 well plates in serum-free media 4 hr prior
to infection, removed during the adsorption
phase, then another 100 nmol NR in serum free
media was added following the adsorption
phase. Another 100 nmol of NR was then added
directly to the media again at 12 hpi. Cells and
supernatants were collected at 18 hpi and viral
titers were determined by plaque assay.
Quantitative
NAD
metabolomics—NAD
metabolites were quantified against internal
standards in two LC-MS/MS runs as described
(33).
Western Analysis of PARP MARylation—
HEK293T were transfected with 3µg pEGFP-C1
empty
vector,
pEGFP-C1-CMV-PARP7,
pEGFP-C1-CMV-PARP10, pEGFP-C1-CMVPARP12, or pEF1-EGFP-C1-PARP14[5531801] via CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit.
Six hours later the cells were treated with

chemical treatments in DMEM + 10% FBS at
37˚C 5% CO2 for 18h. Cells were washed in
PBS and lysed in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150
mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 1%
Triton X-100 with the addition of Protease
Inhibitors (Roche), 30 µM rucaparib (Selleck),
and 1 µM PDD0017273 (Sigma). Lysates were
microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4˚C, quantified
by Bradford assay, and supernatants were
transferred to new tube with 4x SDS sample
loading buffer (0.2M Tris-HCl pH 6.5, 4%
BME, 8% w/v SDS, 0.0.8% Bromophenol Blue,
40% Glycerol). Samples were resolved via SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots
were blocked with 5% Milk-PBST for 30 min,
incubated O/N in primary antibody (Rabbit PanADPr 1:1000, Cell Signaling E6F6A; Rabbit
GFP 1:1000, Chromotek PABG1-100; Mouse
Tubulin 1:1000; Cell Signaling DM1A). Primary
incubation was followed with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Rabbit-HRP 1:10000,
Jackson Laboratories 111-035-144; Mouse-HRP
1:5000, Invitrogen 62-6520). Blots were
developed by chemiluminescence and imaged on
a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). Blot
analysis was performed in Image-Lab (Bio-Rad).
PARP
Plasmids—pEGFP-C1-CMV-PARP7,
pEGFP-C1-CMV-PARP10, pEGFP-C1-CMVPARP12, and pEF1-EGFP-C1-PARP14[5531801] were generated with standard restriction
digest cloning.

Dysregulation of NAD Metabolism by Coronaviruses and PARPs

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the NAD gene set in vitro as a function of viral load.
Differential expression analysis was performed on RNAseq data with respect to a 71 gene set
representing the NAD transcriptome (Supplementary Table 1). Depicted are Volcano Plots
representing normalized relative expression versus -log(P) with respect to mock infected in A) human
Calu3 lung cancer cells (MOI = 2), B) NHBE cells (MOI = 2), C and D), A549 cells at low MOI
without and with introduction of ACE2 expression, respectively, E and F) A549 cells at high MOI = 2
without and with introduction of ACE2 expression. Further information is available in Supplementary
Materials 2-7.
Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the NAD gene set in vivo . Differential expression analysis
was performed on RNAseq data with respect to mock infected in A) expanding enterocytes (MOI=1),
B) ferret trachea infected with SARS-CoV-2, C) lung of a diseased COVID-19 patient versus a
control lung sample and D) BALF from SARS-CoV2 infected versus healthy control human patients.
Further information is available in Supplementary Materials 8-11.
Figure 3. PARP10 overexpression is sufficient to depress cellular NAD+ levels while SBI
enhances activities of overexpressed PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14. A) HEK 293T
cells were grown with the indicated expression plasmids for GFP or PARP10 and treated with
NAMPT activator (10 μM SBI). n = 3 for each group. Error bars represent SEM, p-values are from an
unpaired two-tailed t-test. See also Supplementary Information 12. B) GFP, PARP7, PARP10,
PARP12 and PARP14- expressing HEK293 cells were treated with 10 μM SBI and cells were
collected 18 hours later. Western blot using indicated antibodies indicate that SBI promotes PARP7,
PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 activity. n=3. Representative blots of three independent experiments
are shown. ** p≤ 0.01, *** p≤ 0.001
Figure 4. MHV infection disturbs the NAD metabolome. A) DBT cells and B) BMDM cells were
mock infected or infected with MHV at a MOI of 3 PFU/cell and cells were collected at 12 hrs postinfection. n = 3-4 Mock; n = 4 MHV. Error bars represent SEM, p-values are from unpaired twotailed t-test. **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤0 .001. See also Supplementary Materials 13-14.
Figure 5. Boosting NAD+ levels depresses replication of CARH mutant MHV. A) NAD
biosynthetic pathways. Red arrows depict gene expression that is depressed by SARS-CoV-2. Green
arrows depict gene expression that is increased by SARS-CoVo2. B) 17Cl-1 cells were infected with
0.1 PFU/cell WT or N1347A MHV and either mock treated (DMSO or H2O) or treated with NA,
NAM, SBI or NR as described in Methods. DMSO served as a solvent control for NAM, SBI and NA,
while H2O served as a solvent control for NR. Cells were collected at 18 hpi and analyzed for virus
replication by plaque assay. Data are representative of two independent experiments, n = 3 biological
replicates. C) BMDMs were infected with 0.1 PFU/cell WT or N1347A MHV and treated with H2O
or treated with NR as described in Methods. Cells were collected at 18 hpi and analyzed for virus
replication by plaque assay. Data are representative of two independent experiments. n = 4 biological
replicates. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p≤0.001.
