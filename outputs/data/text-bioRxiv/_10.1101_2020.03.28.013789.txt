ABSTRACT

25
26

Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the

27

secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein

28

interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic

29

regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides

30

22500 – 23000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and

31

downstream, however, vary significantly. This part codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with

32

the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S may be

33

connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population.

36

Our predictions indicate that the 5’ end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with

37

several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing such as double-

38

stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to

39

form stress granules and phase-separated complexes. We propose that these proteins, also

40

implicated in viral infections such as HIV, are selectively recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome to

41

alter transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of host cells and to promote viral replication.

INTRODUCTION

45
46

A disease named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization and caused by the severe acute

47

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized as responsible for the

48

pneumonia outbreak that started in December, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei, China 1 and spread in

49

February to Milan, Lombardy, Italy 2 becoming pandemic. As of June 2020, the virus infected

50

>9’000’000 people in >300 countries.

51
52

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that shares similarities with other beta-

53

coronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East

54

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 3. Bats have been identified as the primary host for

55

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 4,5 but the intermediate host linking SARS-CoV-2 to humans is still

56

unknown, although a recent report indicates that pangolins could be involved 6.

57
58

Coronaviruses use species-specific proteins to mediate the entry in the host cell and the spike S

59

protein activates the infection in human respiratory epithelial cells in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and

60

SARS-CoV-2 7. Spike S is assembled as a trimer and contains around 1,300 amino acids within

61

each unit 8,9. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike S, which contains around 300 amino

62

acids, mediates the binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme, (ACE2) attacking respiratory

63

cells. Another region upstream of the RBD, present in MERS-CoV but not in SARS-CoV, is

64

involved in the adhesion to sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides and plays a key role in regulating

65

viral infection 7,10.

66
67

At present, few molecular details are available on SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with the human

68

host, which are mediated by specific RNA elements 11. To study the RNA structural content, we

69

used CROSS 12 that was previously developed to investigate large transcripts such as the human

70

immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 13. CROSS predicts the structural profile of RNA molecules (single-

71

and double-stranded state) at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information only. Here,

72

we performed sequence and structural alignments among >60 SARS-CoV-2 strains and identified

73

the conservation of specific elements in the spike S region, which provides clues on the evolution of

74

domains involved in the binding to ACE2 and sialic acid.

75
76

As highly structured regions of RNA molecules have strong propensity to form stable contacts with

77

proteins 14 and promote assembly of specific complexes 15,16, SARS-CoV-2 domains enriched in

78

double-stranded content are expected to establish interactions within host cells that are important to

79

replicate the virus 17. To investigate the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with human proteins, we

80

employed catRAPID 18,19. catRAPID 20 estimates the binding potential of a specific protein for an

81

RNA molecule through van der Waals, hydrogen bonding and secondary structure propensities

82

allowing identification of interaction partners with high confidence 21. The computational analysis

83

of more than 100000 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RNA reveals that the 5’ end of SARS-CoV-2

84

has strong propensity to bind to human proteins involved in viral infection and reported to be

85

associated with HIV infection. A comparison between SARS-CoV and HIV reveals similarities 22

86

that are is still unexplored. Interestingly, HIV and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV nor MERS-

87

CoV, have a furin-cleavage site occurring in the spike S protein, which could explain the high

88

velocity spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 23,24.

89
90

Many processes related to SARS-CoV-2 replication are at present unknown and our study aims to

91

suggest relevant protein interactions for further investigation. We hope that our large-scale

92

calculations of structural properties and binding partners of SARS-CoV-2 will be useful to identify

93

the mechanisms of virus replication within the human host.

RESULTS

96
97

SARS-CoV-2 contains highly structured elements

98
99

Structured elements within RNA molecules attract proteins 14 and reveal regions important for

100

interactions with the host 25. Indeed, each gene expressed from SARS-CoV-2 is preceded by

101

conserved transcription-regulating sequences that act as signal for the transcription complex during

102

the synthesis of the RNA minus strand to promote a strand transfer to the leader region to resume

103

the synthesis. This process is named discontinuous extension of the minus strand and is a variant of

104

similarity-assisted template switching that operates during viral RNA recombination 17.

105
106

To analyze SARS-CoV-2 structure (reference Wuhan strain MN908947.3), we employed CROSS 12

107

to predict the double- and single-stranded content of RNA genomes such as HIV-1 13. We found the

108

highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5’ end (nucleotides 1-253), membrane M protein

109

(nucleotides 26523-27191), spike S protein (nucleotides 21563-25384), and nucleocapsid N protein

110

(nucleotides 28274-29533; Fig. 1A) 26. The lowest density of double-stranded regions were

111

observed at nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 and correspond to the regions between the

112

non-structural proteins nsp14 and nsp15 and the upstream region of the spike surface protein S (Fig.

113

1) 26. In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 22500-23000, the structural content

114

of Spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 21500-22000 and 23500-24000 (Fig. 1).

115

We used the Vienna method 27 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific

116

regions identified with CROSS

117

maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.

118

1).

13

. Employing a 100-nucleotide window centered around CROSS

119
120

RNA structure in vitro and in vivo could be significantly different due to the interaction with

121

proteins and other molecules 28. Using CROSS alive to predict the double- and single-stranded

122

content of SARS-CoV-2 in the cellular context 28, we found that both the 5’ and 3’ ends are the

123

most structured regions followed by nucleotides 22500-23000 in the Spike S region, while

124

nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 have the lowest density of double-stranded regions (Fig.

125

1B). The region corresponding to nucleotides 13400-13600 shows high density of contacts. This

126

part of SARS-CoV-2 sequence has been proposed to form a pseudoknot 29 that is also visible in

127

CROSS profile (Fig. 1A), but CROSS alive is able to identify long range interactions and better

128

identifies the region. Additionally, we used the RF-Fold algorithm of the RNAFramework suite 30

129

(Materials and Methods) to search for pseudoknots. Employing CROSS as a soft-constraint for

130

RF-Fold, we predicted 6 pseudoknots (nucleotides 3394-3404, 13723-13732, 14677-14711, 16867-

131

16905, 24844-24884, 27969-27990). The pseudoknot at nucleotides 13723-13732 is in close

132

proximity to the one proposed for SARS-CoV-2 29 and the one at nucleotides 27969-27990 is at the

133

3’ end, where pseudonoknots have been shown to occur in coronaviruses 31.

134
135

To validate our results, we compared CROSS predictions of double- and single-stranded content

136

predicted (as released in March 2020) with the secondary structure landscape of SARS-CoV-2

137

revealed by SHAPE mutational profiling (SHAPEMaP) 32. In this approach, the authors performed

138

in vitro refolding of RNA followed by probing with 2- methylnicotinic acid imidazolide. In our

139

comparison, balanced lists of single and double stranded regions were used for the calculations: A

140

confidence score of 10% indicates that we compared the SHAPE reactivity values of 3000

141

nucleotides associated with the highest CROSS scores (i.e., double stranded) and 3000 nucleotides

142

associated with the lowest CROSS scores (i.e., single stranded). From low (10%) to high (0.1%)

143

confidence scores, we observed that the predictive power, measured as the Area Under the Curve

144

(AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), increases monotonically reaching the value of

145

0.73 (the AUC is 0.74 for the 10 highest/lowest scores; Fig. 1C), which indicates that CROSS is

146

able to reproduce SHAPEMaP in great detail.

147
148

We also assessed CROSS performances on structures of betacoronavirus 5' and 3' ends 33–36 (Fig.

149

1D). In this analysis, we used RFAM multiple sequence alignments of betacoronavirus 5’ and 3’

150

ends and relative consensus structures (RF03117 and RF03122) 33–36. We generated the 2D

151

representation of nucleotide chains of consensus structures. We extracted the ‘secondary structure

152

occupancy’, as defined in a previous work 20, and counted the contacts present around each

153

nucleotide. Following the procedure used for the comparison with SHAPEMaP, different

154

progressive cut-offs were used for ranking all the structures using balanced lists of single and

155

double stranded regions: 10% indicates that we compared 600 nucleotides associated with the

156

highest amount of contacts and 600 nucleotides associated with the lowest amount of contacts.

157

From low (10%) to high (0.1%) confidence scores we observed that the AUC of ROC increases

158

monotonically reaching the value of 0.75 (10 highest/lowest scores have an AUC of 0.78; Fig. 1C),

159

which indicates that CROSS is able to identify known double and single stranded regions reported

160

in great detail. We also tested the ability of CROSS to recognize specific secondary structures in

161

representative cases for which we studied both the 3’ and 5’ ends: NC_006213 or Human

162

coronavirus OC43 strain ATCC VR-759, NC_019843 or Middle East respiratory syndrome

163

coronavirus, NC_026011 or Betacoronavirus HKU24 strain HKU24-R05005I, NC_001846 or

164

Mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 C12 and NC_012936 or Rat coronavirus Parker (Supp. Fig.

165

2).

166
167

In summary, our analysis identifies several structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome 11.

168

Different lines of experimental and computational evidence indicate that transcripts containing a

169

large amount of double-stranded regions have a strong propensity to recruit proteins 14 and can act

170

as scaffolds for protein assembly 15,16. We expected that the 5’ end attracts several host proteins

171

because of the enrichment in secondary structure elements. The binding would not just involve

proteins interacting with double-stranded regions. If a specific protein contact occurs in a loop at the

173

end of a long RNA stem, the overall region is enriched in double-stranded nucleotides but the

174

specific interaction takes place in a single-stranded element.

175
176

Structural comparisons reveal that a spike S region of SARS-CoV-2 is conserved among

177

coronaviruses

178
179

We employed CROSSalign 13 to study the structural conservation of SARS-CoV-2 in different

180

strains (Materials and Methods).

181
182

In our analysis, we compared the Wuhan strain MN908947.3 with 2040 coronaviruses (reduced to

183

267 sequences upon redundancy removal at 95% sequence similarity 37; Fig. 2; full data shown in

184

Supp. Fig. 1). The 5’ end is highly variable. However, it is more structured in SARS-CoV-2 than

185

other coronaviruses (average structural content of 0.56, indicating that 56% of the CROSS signal is

186

>0). The 3’ end is less variable and slightly less structured (average structural content of 0.49). By

187

contrast, the other coronaviruses have lower average structural content of 0.49 in the 5’ end and

188

0.42 in the 3’ end. One conserved region falls inside the Spike S genomic locus between nucleotides

189

22000 - 23000 and exhibits an intricate and stable secondary structure (RNAfold minimum free

190

energy= -285kcal/mol )27. High conservation of a structured region suggests a functional activity

191

that is relevant for host infection.

192
193

To demonstrate the conservation of nucleotides 22000-23000 (fragment 23), we divided this region

194

and the adjacent ones (nucleotides 21000-22000 and 23000-24000) into sub-fragments. We then

195

used the RF-Fold algorithm of the RNAFramework suite 30 to fold the different sub-regions using

196

CROSS predictions as soft-constraints. The structural motives identified with this procedure were

197

employed to build covariance models (CMs) that were then searched in our set of coronaviruses

198

using the ‘Infernal’ package 38. We found that nucleotides 501-750 within fragment 23 have the

199

highest number of matches for different confidence thresholds, implying a higher chance of

200

sequence and structure conservation across coronaviruses (E-values of 10,1, 0.1; Fig. 2B). We

201

specifically counted the matches falling in the Spike S region (+/- 1000 nucleotides to take into

202

account the division of the genome into fragments; Supp. Table 1). For the large majority of

203

annotated sequences, we found a match falling in the Spike S region (239 genomes out of 246, of

204

which 161 with E-value below 0.1) This further emphasizes the conservation of the region in exam.

205

Sequence and structural comparisons among SARS-CoV-2 strains.

206
207

To better investigate the sequence conservation of SARS-CoV-2, we compared >60 strains isolated

208

from different countries during the pandemic (including China, USA, Japan, Taiwan, India, Brazil,

209

Sweden, and Australia; data from NCBI and in VIPR www.viprbrc.org; Materials and Methods).

210

Our analysis aims to determine the relationship between structural content and sequence

211

conservation.

212
213

Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 39, we observed general conservation of the

214

coding regions (Fig. 3A). The 5’ and 3’ ends show high variability due to experimental procedures

215

of the sequencing and are discarded in this analysis 40 . One highly conserved region is between

216

nucleotides 22000 - 23000 in the Spike S genomic locus, while sequences up- and downstream are

217

variable (red bars in Fig. 3A). We then used CROSSalign 13 to compare the structural content

218

(Materials and Methods). High variability of structure is observed for both the 5’ and 3’ ends and

219

for nucleotides 21000 - 22000 as well as 24000 - 25000, associated with the Spike S region (purple

220

bars in Fig. 3A). The rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural level (p-value <

221

0.0001; Fisher’s test).

222
223

We note that sequence conservation (Fig. 3A) and secondary structure profiles (Fig. 1A) are

224

statistically related. Following the analysis to compare CROSS and SHAPE scores, we selected

225

balanced groups of nucleotides with the highest and lowest sequence conservation and measured

226

their single and double stranded content: a conservation score of 1% indicates that we compared

227

300 nucleotides with the highest sequence similarity and 300 nucleotides with the lowest sequence

228

similarity. At conservation score of 1% (or less stringent threshold of 10%), the match between

229

similarity and structure, measured as the AUC of ROC is 0.76 (or 0.60, respectively). The

230

association is statistically significant: shuffling the sequence conservation profiles, the empirical p-

231

values are < 0.02 (at both 10% and 1% conservation scores).

232
233

We also compared protein sequences coded by the Spike S genomic locus (NCBI reference

234

QHD43416) and found that both sequence (Fig. 3A) and structure (Fig. 2) of nucleotides 22000 -

235

23000 are highly conserved. The region corresponds to amino acids 330-500 that contact the host

236

receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 41 promoting infection and provoking lung injury

239

is highly variable 43, as indicated by T-coffee multiple sequence alignments 43 (Fig. 3A). This part of

240

the Spike S region corresponds to amino acids 243-302 that in MERS-CoV binds to sialic acids

241

regulating infection through cell-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 3B; see related manuscript by E.

242

Milanetti et al.) 10,44,45.

243
244

Our analysis suggests that the structural region between nucleotides 22000 and 23000 of Spike S

245

region is conserved among coronaviruses (Fig. 2) and that the binding site for ACE2 has poor

246

variation in human SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the region upstream, which has

247

propensity to bind sialic acids 10,44,45, showed poor structural content and high variability (Fig. 3B).

248
249

Analysis of human interactions with SARS-CoV-2 identifies proteins involved in viral

250

replication

251
252

In order to obtain insights on how the virus replicates in human cells, we predicted SARS-CoV-2

253

interactions with the whole RNA-binding human proteome. Following a protocol to study structural

254

conservation in viruses 13, we first divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 fragments of 1000 nucleotides

255

each moving from the 5’ to 3’ end and then calculated the protein-RNA interactions of each

256

fragment with catRAPID omics (3340 canonical and putative RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, for a

257

total 102000 interactions) 18. Proteins such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1

258

(Uniprot P26599) showed the highest interaction propensity (or Z-score; Materials and Methods)

259

at the 5’ end while others such as Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ (O60506)

260

showed the highest interaction propensity at the 3’end , in agreement with previous studies on

261

coronaviruses (Fig. 4A) 46.

262
263

For each fragment, we predicted the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z

264

score. We used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z ≥ 1.50, 1.75 and 2

265

respectively and we removed from the list the proteins that were predicted to interact promiscuously

266

with more than one fragment. Fragment 1 corresponds to the 5’ end and is the most contacted by

267

RBPs (around 120 with Z≥2 high-confidence interactions; Fig. 4B), which is in agreement with the

268

observation that highly structured regions attract a large number of proteins

269

contains multiple stem loop structures that control RNA replication and transcription

270

contrast, the 3’ end and fragment 23 (Spike S), which are still structured but to a lesser extent,

271

attract fewer proteins (10 and 5, respectively) and fragment 20 (between Orf1ab and Spike S) that is

272

predicted to be unstructured, does not have predicted binding partners.

annotations related to viral processes (Fig. 4C; Supp. Table 2). Considering the three thresholds

277

applied (Materials and Methods), we found 23 viral proteins (including 2 pseudogenes), for

278

fragment 1, 2 proteins for fragment 2 and 11 proteins for fragment 29 (Fig. 4D). Among the high-

279

confidence interactors of fragment 1, we discovered RBPs involved in positive regulation of viral

280

processes and viral genome replication, such as double-stranded RNA-specific editase 1 ADARB1

281

(Uniprot P78563), 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease RNASEL (Q05823) and 2-5-oligoadenylate

282

synthase 2 OAS2 (P29728; Fig. 5A). Interestingly, 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 OAS2 has been

283

reported to be upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma (A549) cells infected with SARS-

284

CoV-2 (log fold change of 4.2; p-value of 10-9 and q-value of 10-6) 50. While double-stranded RNA-

285

specific adenosine deaminase ADAR (P55265) is absent in our library due to its length that does not

286

meet catRAPID omics requirements

287

developed for large molecules

288

ADAR, thus indicating that the interactions with SARS-CoV-2 are likely to occur (Materials and

289

Methods). Moreover, experimental works indicate that the family of ADAR deaminases is active in

290

bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from SARS-CoV-2 patients

291

cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (log fold change of 0.58; p-value of 10-8 and q-value of 10-5) 50.

49

. Proteins interacting with fragments 1, 2 and 29 were associated with

51

18

, the omiXcore extension of the algorithm specifically

attributes the same binding propensity to both ADARB1 and

52

and is upregulated in A549

292
293

We also identified proteins related to the establishment of integrated proviral latency, including X-

294

ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 XRCC5 (P13010) and X-ray repair cross-complementing

295

protein 6 XRCC6 (P12956; Fig. 5A). In accordance with our calculations, comparison of A549

296

cells responses to SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, indicates upregulation of XRRC6 in

297

SARS-CoV-2 (log fold-change of 0.92; p-value of 0.006 and q-value of 0.23) 50. Moreover,

298

previous evidence suggests that the binding of XRCC6 takes places at the 5’ end of SARS-CoV-2,

299

thus giving further support to our predictions 53. Nucleolin NCL (P19338), a protein known to be

300

involved in coronavirus processing, was also predicted to bind tightly to the 5’ end (Supp. Table 2)

301

54

.

302
303

Importantly, we found proteins related to defence response to viruses, such as ATP-dependent RNA

304

helicase DDX1 (Q92499), that are involved in negative regulation of viral genome replication.

305

Some DNA-binding proteins such as Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (O60563), Zinc finger protein 175 ZNF175

306

(Q9Y473) and Prospero homeobox protein 1 PROX1 (Q92786) were included because they could

307

have potential RNA-binding ability (Fig. 5A) 55. As for fragment 2, we found two canonical RBPs:

308

E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM32 (Q13049) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 (P19474),

309

which are listed as negative regulators of viral release from host cell, negative regulators of viral

310

transcription and positive regulators of viral entry into host cells. Among these genes, DDX1 (log

311

fold change of 0.36; p-value of 0.007 and q-value of 0.23) and TRIM21 (log fold change of 0.44; p-

312

value of 0.003 and q-value of 0.18) are also upregulated in A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2

313

50

314

that perform different tasks during HIV assembly, budding, and maturation. More than just scaffold

315

elements, these proteins are elements that accompany viral and host proteins as they traffic to the

316

cell membrane (Supp. Table 2) 56. Finally, among the RBPs with the highest interaction propensity

317

for fragment 23, we found nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 NAP1L1 and E3 ubiquitin-protein

318

ligase makorin-1 MKRN1, which could have an effect on the regulation of cell proliferation.

. Ten of the 11 viral proteins detected for fragment 29 are members of the Gag polyprotein family,

319
320

Analysis of functional annotations carried out with GeneMania 57 revealed that proteins interacting

321

with the 5’ of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are associated with regulatory pathways involving NOTCH2,

322

MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 5A) 58,59.

323

Interestingly, some proteins, including DDX1, CCNT1 and ZNF175 for fragment 1 and TRIM32

324

for fragment 2, have been shown to be necessary for HIV functions and replication inside the cell,

325

as well as SARS-CoV-1. DDX1 has been shown to enable the switch from discontinuous to

326

continuous transcription in SARS-CoV-1 infection and its knockdown reduced the number of

327

longer sub-genomic mRNA (sgmRNA) through interaction with the SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid

328

protein N 60 and Nsp14 61. It functions as a bidirectional helicase, which distinguishes it from the

329

coronaviruses helicases, which can only unwind RNA in the 5' to 3' direction 62, a very important

330

function in highly structured RNA such SARS-CoV-2. DDX1 is also required for HIV-1 Rev as

331

well as for avian coronavirus IBV replication and it binds to the RRE sequence of HIV-1 RNAs 1–3 ,

332

while CCNT1 binds to 7SK snRNA and regulates transactivation domain of the viral nuclear

333

transcriptional activator, Tat 65,66.

Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 proteins interactomes reveal common protein targets

Recently, Gordon et al. reported a list of human proteins binding to Open Reading Frames (ORFs)

338

translated from SARS-CoV-2 67. Identified through affinity purification followed by mass

339

spectrometry quantification, 332 proteins from HEK-293T cells interact with viral ORF peptides.

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2

341

exclusively interacting with fragment 1 (Fig. 4B), we found that 8 are also reported in the list by

342

Gordon et al. 67, which indicates significant enrichment (representation factor of 2.5; p-value of

343

0.02; hypergeometric test with human proteome in background). The fact that our list of protein-

344

RNA binding partners contains elements identified also in the protein-protein network analysis is

345

not surprising, as ribonucleoprotein complexes evolve together 14 and their components sustain each

346

other through different types of interactions 16.

347
348

We note that out of 332 interactions, 60 are RBPs (as reported in Uniprot), which represents a

349

considerable fraction (i.e., 20%), considering that there are around 1500 RBPs in the human

350

proteome (i.e., 6%). Comparing the RBPs present in Gordon et al. 67 and those present in our list

351

(79 RBP annotated in Uniprot), we found an overlap of 6 proteins (representation factor = 26.5; p-

352

value < 10-8; hypergeometric test), including: Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1

353

JAKMIP1 (Q96N16), A-kinase anchor protein 8 AKAP8 (O43823) and A-kinase anchor protein 8-

354

like AKAP8L (Q9ULX6), which in case of HIV-1 infection is involved as a DEAD/H-box RNA

355

helicase binding 69, signal recognition particle subunit SRP72 (O76094), binding to the 7S RNA in

356

presence of SRP68, La-related protein 7, LARP7 (Q4G0J3) and La-related protein 4B LARP4B

357

(Q92615), which are part of a system for transcriptional regulation acting by means of the 7SK

358

RNP system (Fig. 5B; Supp. Table 3). We speculate that sequestration of these elements is

359

orchestrated by a viral program aiming to recruit host genes 71. LARP7 is also upregulated in A549

360

cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (log fold change of 0.48; p-value of 0.006 and q-value of 0.23) 50.

361
362

Moreover, by directly analysing the RNA interaction potential of all the 332 proteins by Gordon et

363

al. 67, catRAPID identified 38 putative binders at the 5’ end (Z score ≥ 1.5; 27 occurring exclusively

364

in the 5’ end and not in other regions of the RNA) 18, including Serine/threonine-protein kinase

365

TBK1 (Q9UHD2), among which 10 RBPs (as reported in Uniprot) such as: Splicing elements U3

366

small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein protein MPP10 (O00566) and Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SLU7

367

(O95391), snRNA methylphosphate capping enzyme MEPCE involved in negative regulation of

368

transcription by RNA polymerase II 7SK (Q7L2J0) 72, Nucleolar protein 10 NOL10 (Q9BSC4) and

369

protein kinase A Radixin RDX (P35241; in addition to those mentioned above; Supp. Table 3).

370
371

Using the liver cell line HuH7 a recent experimental study by Schmidt et al. 73. identified SARS-

372

CoV-2 RNA associations within the human host 73. Through the RAP-MS approach, 571

373

interactions were detected, of which 250 are RBPs (as reported in Uniprot) 73.

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2

375

In common with our library we found an overlap of 148 proteins. We compared predicted (as

376

released in March 2020) and experimentally-validated interactions employing balanced lists of

377

high-affinity (high fold-change with respect to RNA Mitochondrial RNA Processing

378

Endoribonuclease RMRP) and low-affinity (low fold-change with respect to RNA Mitochondrial

379

RNA Processing Endoribonuclease RMRP) associations: a confidence score of 25% indicates that

380

we compared the interaction scores of 35 proteins with the highest fold-change values and 35

381

interactions associated with the lowest fold-change values. From low (25%) to high (5%)

382

confidence scores, we observed that the predictive power, measured as the Area Under the Curve

383

(AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), increases monotonically reaching the value of

384

0.99 (the AUC is 0.72 for 25% confidence score; Supp. Fig. 3), which indicates strong agreement

385

between predictions and experiments. In addition to DDX1 and DDX3X (O00571), other

386

interactions corresponding to catRAPID scores > 1.5 and fold-change > 1 include Insulin-like

387

growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 IGF2BP1 (Q9Y6M1), Insulin-like growth factor 2

388

mRNA-binding protein 2 IGF2BP2 2 (Q9Y6M1) and La-related protein 4 LARP4 (Q71RC2; also

389

in Gordon et al. 67).

390
391

By directly analysing RNA interactions of all the 571 proteins by Schmidt et al. 73, catRAPID

392

identified 18 strong RBP binders at the 5’ end (Z score ≥ 1.5; fold-change>1; p-value of 0.008

393

computed with respect to all the interactions; Fisher exact test; Supp. Table. 4), including Helicase

394

MOV-10 (Q9HCE1), Cold shock domain-containing protein E1 CSDE1 (O75534), Staphylococcal

395

nuclease domain-containing protein 1 SND1 (Q7KZF4), Pumilio homolog 1 PUM1 (Q14671), and

396

La-related protein 1 LARP1 (Q6PKG0), among other interactions (Supp. Table 4).

397

The 5’ end is enriched in host interactions implicated in other viral infections.

400
401

In the list of 274 proteins binding to the 5’ end (fragment 1) with Z score ≥1.5, we found 10 hits

402

associated with HIV (Supp. Table 5), which represents a significant enrichment (p-value=0.0004;

403

Fisher’s exact test), considering that the total number of HIV-related proteins is 35 in the whole

404

catRAPID library (3340 elements). The complete list of proteins includes ATP-dependent RNA

405

helicase DDX1 (Q92499), ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X (O00571 also involved in

406

Dengue and Zika Viruses), Tyrosine-protein kinase HCK (P08631, nucleotide binding), Arf-GAP

423

Very importantly, specific chemical compounds have been developed to interact with HIV- and

424

HVB-related proteins. The list of HIV-related targets reported in ChEMBL 74 includes ATP-

425

dependent RNA helicase DDX1 (CHEMBL2011807), ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X

426

(CHEMBL2011808), Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (CHEMBL2348842), and Tyrosine-protein kinase HCK

427

(CHEMBL2408778), among other targets. In addition, HVB-related targets are Nuclear receptor

subfamily 5 group A member 2 NR5A2 (CHEMBL3544), Interferon-induced, double-stranded

429

RNA-activated protein kinase EIF2AK2 (CHEMBL5785) and SRSF protein kinase 1 SRPK1

(CHEMBL4375). We hope that this list can be the starting point for further pharmaceutical studies.

Phase-separating proteins are enriched in the 5’ end interactions

434
435

As SARS-CoV-2 represses host gene expression through a number of unknown mechanisms,

436

sequestration of cell transcription machinery elements could be exploited to alter biological

437

pathways in the host cell. A number of proteins identified in our catRAPID calculations have been

438

previously reported to coalesce in large ribonucleoprotein assemblies similar to stress granules.

439

Among these proteins, we found double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase EIF2AK2

(P19525), Nucleolin NCL (P19338), ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1 (Q92499), Cyclin-T1

443

(P26599) and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ (O60506) 75. To further

444

investigate the propensity of these proteins to phase separate, we used the catGRANULE algorithm

445

(Materials and Methods) 76 . We found that the 274 proteins binding to the 5’ end (fragment 1)

446

with Z score ≥1.5 are highly prone to accumulate in assemblies similar to stress-granules (274

447

proteins with the lowest Z score are used in the comparison; p-value<0.0001; Kolmogorov-

448

Smirnoff; Fig. 5C; Supp. Table 6).

449
450

Supporting this hypothesis, DDX1 and CCNT1 have been shown to condense in membrane-less

451

organelles such as stress granules 77–79 that are the direct target of RNA viruses 80. DDX1 is also the

452

primary component of distinct nuclear foci 81, together with factors associated with pre-mRNA

453

processing and polyadenylation . Similarly, SRP72, LARP7 and LARP4B proteins have been found

454

to assemble in stress granules 82,83,75. A recent work also suggests that the binding of LARP4 and

455

XRCC6 takes places at the 5’ end of SARS-CoV-2 and contributes to SARS-CoV-2 phase

456

separation 53. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N

457

has a strong phase separation propensity that is modulated by the viral genome 53,84,85 and can enter

458

into host cell protein condensates 84, suggesting a possible mechanism of cell protein sequestration.

459

Notably, catGRANULE does predict that nucleocapsid protein N is the viral protein with highest

460

propensity to phase separate 86.

461
462

Our observations are particularly relevant because RNA viruses are known to antagonize stress

463

granules formation 80. Indeed, the role of stress granules and processing bodies in translation

464

suppression and RNA decay have impact on virus replication 87.

466

CONCLUSIONS

467
468

Our study is motivated by the need to identify molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19

469

spreading. Using advanced computational approaches, we investigated the structural content of

470

SARS-CoV-2 genome and predicted human proteins that bind to it.

471
13,12

472

We employed CROSS

473

identified elements conserved in SARS-CoV-2 strains. The regions containing the highest amount

474

of structure are the 5’ end as well as glycoproteins spike S and membrane M.

to compare the structural properties of around 2000 coronaviruses and

475
476

We found that the Spike S protein domain encompassing amino acids 460-520 is conserved across

477

SARS-CoV-2 strains. This result suggests that Spike S must have evolved to specifically interact

478

with its host partner ACE2 41 and mutations increasing the binding affinity should be highly

479

infrequent. As nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content, we

480

speculate that the structure might attract host regulatory elements, such as nucleosome assembly

481

protein 1-like 1 NAP1L1 and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase makorin-1 MKRN1, further constraining

482

its variability. The fact that this region of the Spike S region is highly conserved among all the

483

analysed SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests that a specific drug could be designed to prevent

484

interactions within the host.

485
486

The highly variable region at amino acids 243-302 in spike S protein corresponds to the binding site

487

of sialic acids in MERS-CoV 7,10,45 and could play a role in infection 44. The fact that the binding

488

region is highly variable suggests different affinities for sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides and

489

polysaccharides such as heparan sulfate, which provides clues on the specific responses in the

490

human population. At present, a glycan microarray technology indicated that SARS-CoV-2 Spike S

491

binds more tightly to heparan sulfate than sialic acids 88.

492
493

Using catRAPID 18,19 we computed >100000 protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 and found

494

previously reported interactions such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1,

495

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ and Nucleolin NCL 54. In addition, we

496

discovered that the highly structured region at the 5’end has the largest number of protein partners

497

including ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1, which was previously reported to be essential for

498

HIV-1 and coronavirus IBV replication 63,64, and the double-stranded RNA-specific editases

499

ADAR and ADARB1, which catalyse the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine. Other

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2

500

predicted interactions are XRCC5 and XRCC6 members of the HDP-RNP complex associating

501

with ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX9 90 as well as and 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease RNASEL

502

and 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 OAS2 that control viral RNA degradation 91,92. Interestingly,

503

DDX1, XRCC6 and OAS2 were found upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells

504

infected with SARS-CoV-2 50 and DDX1 knockdown has been shown to reduce the number of

505

sgmRNA in SARS-CoV-1 infected cells 60. In agreement with our predictions, recent experimental

506

work indicates that the family of ADAR deaminases is active in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids

507

derived from SARS-CoV-2 patients 52.

508
509

Comparison with protein-RNA interactions detected in the liver cell line HuH7 73 shows agreement

510

with our predictions. We note that the experiments have been carried out 24 hours after infection 73,

511

which indicates that the protein interaction landscape might have changed with respect to the early

512

events of replication. Yet, the accordance with our calculations indicates participation of elements

513

involved in controlling RNA processing and editing (DDX1, DDX3X) and translation (IGF2BP1

514

and IGF2BP2), although proteins such as ADAR and XRCC5 were reported to have poorer binding

515

capacity 73.

516
517

A significant overlap exists with the list of protein interactions reported by Gordon et al. 67, and

518

among the candidate partners we identified AKAP8L, involved as a DEAD/H-box RNA helicase

519

binding protein involved in HIV infection 69. In general, proteins associated with retroviral

520

replication are expected to play different roles in SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 massively

521

represses host gene expression

522

transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements interacting with polymerase II genes and splicing

523

factors such as for instance A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L and La-related protein 7

524

LARP7. In concordance with our predictions LARP7 has been reported to be upregulated in human

525

alveolar adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 50. The link to proteins previously

526

studied in the context of HIV and other viruses, if further confirmed, is particularly relevant for the

527

repurposing of existing drugs 74.

71

, we hypothesize that the virus hijacks host pathways by recruiting

528
529

The idea that SARS-CoV-2 sequesters different elements of the transcriptional machinery is

530

particularly intriguing and is supported by the fact that a large number of proteins identified in our

531

screening are found in stress granules 75. Indeed, stress granules protect the host innate immunity

532

and are hijacked by viruses to favour their own replication 87. Moreover, as coronaviruses

533

transcription uses discontinuous RNA synthesis that involves high-frequency recombination 54, it is

possible that pieces of the viruses resulting from a mechanism called defective interfering RNAs 93

535

could act as scaffold to attract host proteins 14,15. In agreement with our hypothesis, it has been very

536

recently shown that he coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N can form protein condensates based on

537

viral RNA scaffold and can merge with the human cell protein condensates 84, which provides a

538

potential mechanism of host protein sequestration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

561
562

Structure prediction

563
564

We predicted the secondary structure of transcripts using CROSS (Computational Recognition of

565

Secondary Structure) 13,12. The algorithm predicts the structural profile (single- and double-stranded

566

state) at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information only and without sequence length

567

restrictions (scores > 0 indicate double stranded regions). We used the Vienna RNA Package 27 to

568

further investigate the RNA secondary structure of minima and maxima identified with CROSS

13

.

569
28

570

CROSS alive was employed to predict SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure in vivo

571

(m6A+ fast option) predicts long range interactions and can identify pseudoknots of 50-100

572

nucleotides. The RF-Fold algorithm of the RNAFramework suite

573

pseudoknots in SARS-CoV-2. In this analysis, the partition function was calculated using CROSS

574

calculations as soft-constraints. RNA was then folded employing Vienna RNA Package

575

pseudo-knotted bases were hard-constrained to be single-stranded.

583

Structural conservation

584
585

We used CROSSalign 13,12, an algorithm based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), to check and

586

evaluate the structural conservation between different viral genomes 13. CROSSalign was previously

587

employed to study the structural conservation of ~5000 HIV genomes. SARS-CoV-2 fragments

588

(1000 nt, not overlapping) were searched inside other complete genomes using the OBE (open

589

begin and end) module, in order to search a small profile inside a larger one. The lower the

590

structural distance, the higher the structural similarities (with a minimum of 0 for almost identical

591

secondary structure profiles). The significance is assessed as in the original publication 13.

594

The Infernal package (version 1.1.3) was employed to build covariance models (CMs) for

595

fragments 22,23 and 24 38. The package was then used to search for sequence and structural

596

similarities among RNAs in our database (267 representative sequences), which allows to identify a

597

series of matches below a specific E-value threshold (0.1, 1 and 10). The analysis shows agreement

598

with CROSSalign 13,12 results. The minimum and maximum number of identified motifs were 224

599

and 4878 (E-value of 10), 136 and 3093 (E-value of 1) and 94 and 1060 (E-value of 0.1). The

600

motifs in Spike S region were counted for annotated coronaviruses (239 genomes out of 246, of

601

which 161 within E-value of 0.1).

602
603
604

Sequence collection

605
606

The FASTA sequences of the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded in April 2020

607

from Virus Pathogen Resource (VIPR; www.viprbrc.org), for a total of 62 strains. Regarding the

608

other coronaviruses, the sequences were downloaded in April 2020 from NCBI selecting only

609

complete genomes, for a total of 2040 genomes. The reference Wuhan sequence with available

610

annotation (EPI_ISL_402119) was downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza

611

Data in April 2020. (GISAID https://www.gisaid.org/).

612
613
614

Protein-RNA interaction prediction

615
616

Interactions between each fragment of target sequence and the human proteome were predicted

617

using catRAPID omics 18,19 , an algorithm that estimates the binding propensity of protein-RNA

618

pairs by combining secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contributions. As

619

reported in a recent analysis of about half a million of experimentally validated interactions 31, the

620

algorithm is able to separate interacting vs non-interacting pairs with an area under the ROC curve

621

of 0.78. The complete list of interactions between the 30 fragments and the human proteome is

622

available at http://crg-webservice.s3.amazonaws.com/submissions/2020-

623

03/252523/output/index.html?unlock=f6ca306af0. The output then is filtered according to the Z-

624

score column, which is the interaction propensity normalised by the mean and standard deviation

625

calculated over the reference RBP set (http://s.tartaglialab.com/static_files/shared/faqs.html#4). We

626

used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z greater or equal than 1.50, 1.75

627

and 2 respectively and for each threshold we then selected the proteins that were unique for each

GO terms analysis

636
637

cleverGO 49, an algorithm for the analysis of Gene Ontology annotations, was used to determine

638

which fragments present enrichment in GO terms related to viral processes. Analysis of functional

639

annotations was performed in parallel with GeneMania 57. The link to cleverGO analyses for

640

RNA and protein alignments

645
39

43

646

We used Clustal W

647

alignments. The variability in the spike S region was measured by computing Shannon entropy on

648

translated RNA sequences. The Shannon entropy is computed as follows:

for 62 SARS-CoV-2 strains alignments and T-Coffee

for spike S proteins

649
650

S(a) = - Sum_i P(a,i) log P(a,i)

651
652

Where a correspond to the amino acid at the position i and P(a,i) is the frequency of a certain

653

amino-acid a at position i of the sequence. Low entropy indicates poorly variability: if P(a,x) = 1 for

654

one a and 0 for the rest, then S(x) =0. By contrast, if the frequencies of all amino acids are equally

655

distributed, the entropy reaches its maximum possible value.

656
657

Predictions of phase separation

658
659

catGRANULE 76 was employed to identify proteins assembling into biological condensates. Scores

660

> 0 indicate that a protein is prone to phase separate. Structural disorder, nucleic acid binding

661

propensity and amino acid patterns such as arginine-glycine and phenylalanine-glycine are key

662

features combined in this computational approach 76.
