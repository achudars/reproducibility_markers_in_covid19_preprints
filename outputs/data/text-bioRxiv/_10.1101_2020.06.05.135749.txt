Abstract
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) quickly become a global public health emergency. Gquadruplex, one of the non-canonical secondary structures, has shown potential antiviral values.
However, little is known about G-quadruplexes on the emerging SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we
characterized the potential G-quadruplexes both in the positive and negative-sense viral stands. The
identified potential G-quadruplexes exhibits similar features to the G-quadruplexes detected in the
human transcriptome. Within some bat and pangolin related beta coronaviruses, the G-quartets
rather than the loops are under heightened selective constraints. We also found that the SUD-like
sequence is retained in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, while some other coronaviruses that can infect
humans are depleted. Further analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 SUD-like sequence is almost
conserved among 16,466 SARS-CoV-2 samples. And the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer
displayed similar electrostatic potential pattern to the SUD dimer. Considering the potential value
of G-quadruplexes to serve as targets in antiviral strategy, we hope our fundamental research could
provide new insights for the SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, which first broke out in China, has rapidly become a global public health
emergency within a few months[1]. According to the statistics from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus
Resource Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), 6.6 million cases have been confirmed,
with a death toll rising to 389,000. Since 2000, humans have suffered at least three coronavirus
outbreaks, and they were Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003[2-5], Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012[2, 5], and COVID-19. Scientists identified and sequenced
the virus early in this outbreak, and named it SARS-CoV-2[6]. The symptoms of the patients
infected with the novel coronavirus vary from person to person, and fever, cough, and fatigue are
the most common ones[7-10]. The clinical chest CT (Computed tomography) and nucleic acid
testing are the most typical methods of diagnosing COVID-19[9, 10]. It is worth noting that the
recent achievements in AI (Artificial Intelligence) aid diagnosis technology[11] and CRISPRCas12-based detection methods[12] are expected to expand the diagnosis of COVID-19. Despite
the great efforts of the researchers, so far, no specific clinical drugs or vaccines have been developed
to cope with COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae family that is the culprit responsible
for the COVID-19 pandemic[13, 14] (Fig. 1A). Studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is a
positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) virus with a total length of approximately 30k. The
positive-sense RNA strand of SARS-CoV-2 can serve as a template to produce viral proteins related

to replication, structure composition, and other functions or events[15, 16]. One of the hotspots is
how the SARS-CoV-2 entry the host cells. SARS-CoV-2 has shown a great affinity to the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been proved to be the binding receptor for
SARS-CoV-2[17, 18]. After entering the host cells, the viral genomic RNA will be released to the
cytoplasm, and the ORF1a/ORF1ab are subsequently translated into replicase polyproteins of
pp1a/pp1ab, which will be cleaved into some non-structural proteins (nsps). These non-structure
proteins ultimately form the replicase-transcriptase complex for replication and transcription. Along
with the full-length positive and negative-sense RNAs, a nested set of sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs)
are also synthesized, and mainly translated into some structural proteins and accessory proteins.
When assembly finished, the mature SARS-CoV-2 particles are released from infected host cells via
exocytosis[19]. Mounting evidence suggests that bats and pangolins are the suspected natural host
and intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2[20-23]. Intriguingly, a report from Yongyi Shen et al. showed
that SARS-CoV-2 might be the recombination product of Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus and
Pangolin-CoV-like virus[24].
G-quadruplexes are the non-canonical nucleic acid structures usually formed in G-rich regions both
in DNA and RNA strands[25-27]. The G-quadruplex is formed by stacking G-quartets (Fig. 1B) on
top of each other, in which the four guanines making up a G-quartets are connected via Hoogsteen
pairs (Fig. 1C)[25-28]. Extensive research indicated that G-quadruplexes were involved in many
critical biological processes, including DNA replication[29-32], telomere regulation[33-37], and
RNA translation[38-41]. It has been proved that G-quadruplexes existed in the viral genome and
can regulate the viral biological processes, which made it possible to function as potential drug
targets for antiviral strategy[42-44]. A study made by Jinzhi Tan et al. demonstrated that the SARSUnique Domain (SUD) within the nsp3 (non-structural protein 3) of SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV) exhibits the binding preference to the G-quadruplex structure in the human transcript, and
potentially interfere with host cell antiviral response[45]. They also identified several amino acid
residues that were tightly associated with its binding capacity. Yet, whether the SARS-CoV-2
contains a SUD-like structure and whether the structure sequence is conserved among SARS-CoV2 samples needs further interpretation. Besides, the G-quadruplexes in some well-known virus, such
as HIV-1[46-49] (Human Immunodeficiency Viruses type 1), ZIKV[50] (ZIKA Virus), HPV[51, 52]
(Human Papillomavirus) and EBOV[53] (Ebola virus) have been studied. However, our
understanding of the G-quadruplexes, their potential roles, and the SUD-like structures in the
emerging SARS-CoV-2 are lacking.
In this study, we depicted the potential G-quadruplexes (PG4s) in the SARS-CoV-2 by combining
several G-quadruplex prediction tools. The PG4s in SARS-CoV-2 presented similar features to the
two-quartet G-quadruplexes in the human transcriptome, which potentially supported the formation
and existence of the G-quadruplexes in SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated the difference
in selective constraints between the G-quartets and other nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
To further elucidated the possible pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, we examined the SUDlike sequence and structure in SARS-CoV-2 that are critical to binding the G-quadruplexes in host
transcripts.

is composed of four structural proteins, which are the spike protein, the envelope protein, the membrane
protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid proteins are bound to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
(B) Structure of G-quartet, the neighboring guanines are connected via Hoogsteen hydrogen. The cation
is indicated by a yellow circle. (C) The G-quadruplex is formed by stacking multiple G-quartets, and the
stabilization of the structure is partially determined by the central cations.

Results
Whole genome identification and annotation of potential G-quadruplexes
To get the potential G-quadruplexes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we took the strategy described as
follows (Fig. 2A): (i) Predicting the PG4s with three software independently. (ii) Merging the
prediction results of the PG4s and evaluating the G-quadruplex folding capabilities by the cG/cC
scores. (iii) The PG4s with cG/cC scores higher than the threshold were selected as candidates for
further analysis. Here, the threshold for determining whether PG4s can be folded was set to 2.05, as
described in the study of Jean-Denis Beaudoin et al.[54] In total, we obtained 24 PG4s (Table. 1) in
the positive or negative-sense strands for further analysis.
To annotate the PG4s, the reference annotation data (in gff3 format) of SARD-CoV-2 were
downloaded from the NCBI database with the accession number of NC_045512. Firstly, we focused
on the PG4s on the positive-sense strand. Fifteen of the 24 PG4s (67.5%) were located on the
positively-sense strand, the vast majority of them were harbored in non-structural proteins including
nsp1, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp10 and nsp14, with the remaining ones located in the spike protein, orf3a,
and the membrane protein. Secondly, we examined the PG4s on the negative-sense strand, which is
an intermediate product of replication. Nine PG4s were scattered on the negative-sense strand.
To further characterize the potential canonical secondary structures competitive with Gquadruplexes, the landscape of thermodynamic stability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was depicted
by using ΔG° z-score[55]. In general, a positive ΔG° z-score implies that the secondary
structure of this region tends to be less stable than the randomly shuffled sequence with the identical
nucleotide composition, while a negative ΔG°z-score signifies higher stability than the randomly
shuffled sequence. For each nucleotide in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the Δ G ° z-score was
calculated for all the 120 nt windows covering the nucleotide, and an average ΔG°z-score was
deduced then. Several PG4s are located in positions with a locally higher average ΔG°z-scores
(Fig. 2B) which implied the relative instability of a canonical secondary structure and the lower
possibility to adopt such a competitive structure against the G-quadruplex, which may ultimately
favor the formation of G-quadruplex.

Potential G-quadruplexes in SARS-CoV-2 show analogical features with the rG4s in the
human transcriptome
In 2016, Chun Kit Kwok and co-workers profiled the RNA G-quadruplexes in the HeLa
transcriptome by using the RNA G-quadruplex sequencing (rG4-seq) technology, and quantified the
diversity of these RNA G-quadruplexes[56]. We set out to address the question of whether the
potential G-quadruplexes in SARS-CoV-2 showed analogical features with the G-quadruplexes
found in the human transcriptome and if these PG4s have the ability to form G-quadruplex structures.
We noticed that the PG4s in SARS-CoV-2 are all in the two-quartet style. Therefore we retrieved
the two-quartet RNA G-quadruplex sequence data generated in the rG4-seq experiment under the
condition of K+ and pyrdiostatin (PDS). However, for some RTS (Reverse Transcriptase Stalling)
sites labeled as two-quartet, there may exist overlapping G-quadruplexes with different loops (e.g.,
GGCACAGCAGGCATCGGAGGTGAGGCGGGG), and it is difficult to determine which one was
formed in the experiment. In order to eliminate the ambiguity, only the RTS sites containing nonoverlapping two-quartet G-quadruplex (e.g., GTCATTTTTTGTGTTTGGTTTGGTGGTGGC)
were considered.
Firstly, we investigated the loop length distribution pattern of the two-quartet PG4s in both SARSCoV-2 and the human transcriptome (Fig. 3A). As a whole, the two-quartet PG4s in SARS-CoV-2
and the human transcriptome displayed similar loop length distribution patterns, and the loop length
of the PG4s in SARS-CoV-2 falls into the scope of the ones from the human transcriptome. The
distributions of loop length between the SARS-CoV-2 PG4s and the human two-quartet Gquadruplexes did not show discrepancies (Fig. S1, Wilcoxon test, p-value = 0.4552).
Considering the fact that the presence of multiple-cytosine tracks may hinder the formation of Gquadruplexes[54, 57], we examined the cytosine ratio in G-quadruplex loops (Fig. 3B). No
significant difference in loop cytosine ratios was observed between the SARS-CoV-2 PG4s and the
human two-quartet G-quadruplexes (Wilcoxon test, p-value = 0.9911), which suggested that the
loop cytosine ratios between the two types of G-quadruplex were similar.

Taken together, our results suggested that the PG4s in SARS-CoV-2 displayed similar features to
the rG4s in the human transcriptome.

transcriptome and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. (B) The red boxplot shows the ratio of cytosine in human
transcriptome two-quartet G-quadruplex loops. And the blue boxplot displays the ratio of cytosine in
SARS-CoV-2 PG4 loops.

Potential G-quadruplexes are under selective constraints in bat and pangolin related beta
coronaviruses
Recent research revealed that the G-quadruplexes in human UTRs (Untranslated Regions) are under
selective pressures[58], and some coronaviruses on bats and pangolins are closely related to SARSCoV-2. The conservation of the potential G-quadruplexes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome under
selective constraints were analyzed. We collected some beta coronavirus genomic sequences of bats
and pangolins from several public databases and used the NJ (Neighbor-Joining) method to
construct the phylogenetic tree with 1,000 bootstrap replications (Fig. S2). The RS (Rejected
Substitutions) score for each site in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was evaluated by using the
GERP++ software.
We checked the RS score difference between the G-tract (continuous runs of G) nucleotides and
other nucleotides. A significant discrepancy was observed, which means that the G-tracts
nucleotides exhibit heightened selective constraints than other nucleotides in the SARS-CoV-2
genome (Fig. 4A, Wilcoxon test, p-value = 9.254 × 10-8). Considering that the G-tracts are
composed of guanines, the conservation of guanines in and outside the G-tracts in the SARS-CoV2 genome were also compared. We found that the guanines in G-tracts are under heightened selective
constraints (Fig. 4B, Wilcoxon test, p-value = 3.363×10-3). The nucleotides within G-tracts are
more relevant to the G-quadruplexes structural maintenance than loops. Then we compared the Gtract and loop RS scores. As expected, the G-tract RS scores were significantly higher than loops
(Fig. 4C, Wilcoxon test, p-value = 3.962 × 10-7), which suggests that the G-tracts experienced
stronger selective constraints.
We also checked that if the PG4s that are under heightened selective constraints is relevant to its
inherent properties or potential functions rather than the sequence contexts. A random test was
performed to check whether the fragments containing PG4s manifested different average RS scores
compared with random fragments in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The fragments containing PG4 were

designated as the sequence 100 nt upstream and downstream of the PG4 centers. We conducted
1,000 rounds of tests. In each test, we randomly selected 50 fragments from the SARS-CoV-2
genome with a length of 200 nt and carried out the Wilcoxon test to assess the average RS score
difference among the randomly selected fragments and the fragments containing PG4s. The p-value
for each round was retained. As a result, no evident difference was observed as few p-values
(13/1000) were less than 0.05 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that PG4s that are under heightened selective
constraints is more likely to be related to its inherent properties or potential functions rather than
sequence contexts.

SARS-CoV-2 contains similar SUD to SARS-CoV
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could cause acute disease symptoms, and the above coronavirus
shares similar nucleic acid sequence compositions. There is a SUD in the SARS-CoV genome that
can binding to the G-quadruplex structures and it is unclear if the SARS-CoV-2 genome possess the
resemble structure. Thus, we started to explore whether the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains the
protein-coding sequence similar to SUD and whether SARS-CoV-2 retains the ability to bind RNA
G-quadruplexes. We collected the ORF1ab amino acid sequences of some coronaviruses, including
seven known coronaviruses, which can infect humans and other coronaviruses belonging to different
genera. Surprisingly, the SUD protein sequence is absent in some coronaviruses, especially in alpha,
gamma, and delta coronaviruses (Fig. S3). In contrast, the SUD protein sequence is retained in
several beta-coronavirus, particularly in bat and pangolin associated beta coronavirus. Moreover,
among the seven coronaviruses that can infect humans, only SRAS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 keep the
SUD sequence, while the SUD sequence in MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43

and HCoV-HKU1 is depleted. Next, we examined eight key amino acid residues in SUD that
previously reported associated with G-quadruplex binding affinity (Fig. 5A). Almost all the key
amino acid residues are reserved in SARS-CoV-2, except one conservative replacement of K
(Lysine) > R (Arginine). We hypothesized that if the G-quadruplex binding ability is essential for
the SARS-CoV-2, the above amino acid residues should be conservative. We then investigated the
conservation of the eight amino acid residues within SARS-CoV-2 samples. We retrieved the
sequence alignment file of 16,466 SARS-CoV-2 samples from the GISAID database and calculated
the mutation frequency for each nucleotide. We observed the frequency of nucleotide mutations in
the above eight codons. As a result, a limited mutation frequency was found as compared to the
whole genome average mutation frequency (Fig. 5B, frequency = 3.96). Although eight mutations
were detected in glutamate (2432 E), seven of them were synonymous mutations. Next, we checked
the electrostatic potential pattern in the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer structure. The SARS-CoV2 SUDcore-like dimer structure is defined as the dimer structure formed by the amino acid residues
in SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to the SUD of SARS. We found that the SUDcore-like dimer of
SARS-CoV-2 and the SUDcore of SARS present analogical electrostatic potential patterns. The
positively charged patches were observed in the core of the SUDcore-like dimer, which was
surrounded by negatively charged patches (Fig. 5C). In contrast, when the dimer is rotated 180°,
a slightly inclined narrow cleft with negative potential accompanied by the positively charged
patches was discovered (Fig. 5D). And the above patterns also appeared in the SUD dimer. In the
previous reports, several positively charged patches located in the center and back of the dimer were
presumed to bind the G-quadruplex structures. By comparison with the electrostatic potential of the
SARS SUDcore dimer, we identified the positively charged patches located in the center and back of
the SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like dimer, which can potentially bind the G-quadruplexes (Fig. 5C-D).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge losses to humans and made people pay more attention
to public health. A large number of scientists all over the world have been engaged in the fight
against the outbreak. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the key culprit responsible for the outbreak,
and no specific inhibitor drugs have been developed yet. G-quadruplexes have shown tremendous
potential for the development of anticancer[59-62] and antiviral drugs[44, 63, 64], as Gquadruplexes can interfere with many biological processes that are critical to cancer cells and
viruses. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify and characterize the PG4s in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
to provide a possible novel method for the treatment of COVID-19.

In this study, besides three popular G-quadruplexes prediction tools, the cG/cC scoring system,
which is specially designed for the identification of RNA G-quadruplexes, was adopted to determine
the PG4s. Indeed, we did not find the G-quadruplexes with three or more G-quartets, which are
generally considered to be more stable than the two-quartet G-quadruplexes. One of the
controversial issues lies on the stability of the two-quartet G-quadruplexes, especially the folding
capability of those G-quadruplexes in vivo. However, it is well-acknowledged that the RNA Gquadruplexes is more stable than their DNA counterparts[65, 66] and SARS-CoV-2 is a single-strand
RNA virus, which may be conducive to its structure formation. Several emerging studies have
demonstrated the formation of two-quartet G-quadruplexes in viral sequences, which could serve as
antiviral elements under the presence of G-quadruplex ligands[53, 67, 68]. Moreover, the K+
(potassium ion), one of the primary positive ions inside human cells, can strongly support the
formation of G-quadruplexes. Nevertheless, whether the SARS-CoV-2 G-quadruplexes could form
in vivo requires overwhelming proofs.
Most of the PG4s we detected were located in the positive-sense strand. The G-quadruplex forming
sequences in the SARS-CoV genome were presumed to function as the chaperones of SUD, and
their interaction was essential for the SARS-CoV genome replication[69]. ORF1ab that encodes the
replicase proteins is required for the viral replication and transcription. Some PG4s were found to
harbored in ORF1ab, and whether these PG4s were related to the replication of the viral genome
and interact with SUD-like structures like in SARS-CoV, is worthy of further investigation. In
addition to ORF1ab, there exists several PG4s in the structural and accessory protein-coding
sequences as well as the sgRNAs that containing the above protein sequences. Some studies have
characterized the impact of G-quadruplex structures on the translation of human transcripts, and an
apparent inhibitory effect was observed [38, 57, 70]. The translation of some SARS-CoV-2 proteins
requires the involvement of human ribosomes; thus, it is possible to repress the translation of SARSCoV-2 proteins via stabilizing the G-quadruplex structures. In fact, this inhibition effect has been
reported in some other viral studies [67, 71]. The negative-sense strand serves as templates for the
synthesis of the positive-sense strand and the sub-genomic RNAs. The identified potential Gquadruplexes were broadly distributed in the negative-sense strand. Notably, we observed one PG4
located at the 3' end of the negative-sense strand. A previous study confirmed that the stable Gquadruplex structures located at the 3' end of the negative-sense strand could inhibit the RNA
synthesis by reducing the activity of the RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) [72]. Therefore,
it is necessary to further investigate whether the PG4 at the 3' end of the negative-sense strand of
SARS-CoV-2 could inhibit RNA synthesis. In addition, recent research revealed that the highfrequency trinucleotide mutations (G28881A, G2882A and G28883C) were detected in the SARSCoV-2 genome [73, 74]. G28881A and G28882A always co-occur within the same codon, which
means a positive selection of amino acid [75]. We noticed that the trinucleotide mutations were in
the
G-rich
sequence
from
28881
nt
to
28917
nt
(5'
GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAATGGCTGGCAATGGCGG 3'). The potential G-quadruplex
downstream of the trinucleotide mutations was filtered by the cG/cC score system as the presence
of cytosine tracks within and flanking of the potential G-quadruplex reduce the cG/cC score;
however, in fact, this potential G-quadruplex showed a relative lower MFE (Minimum Free Energy)
among all the potential G-quadruplexes we detected. The consequence of the trinucleotide mutations
was still elusive. Whether the mutations have an internal causality with the G-rich sequence still
needs to be elucidated.

The SUD in SARS, which is thought to be related to its terrible pathogenicity, has displayed binding
preference to the G-quadruplexes in human transcripts[45]. Our analysis revealed that the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 contained a similar domain to SUD as well. Furthermore, several amino
acid residues previously reported to be an indispensable part of the G-quadruplexes binding
capability are retained in SARS-CoV-2. Further exploration indicated that the eight key amino acid
residues were conserved in numerous SARS-CoV-2 samples across countries all over the world,
suggesting the essentiality of the above residues. It is supposed that the binding of SUD to Gquadruplexes could affect transcripts stability and translation, hence impairing the immune response
of host cells. The expression of host genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells is extremely inhibited[15];
therefore, we speculate that the SARS-CoV-2 may possess the similar mechanism with SARS-CoV
that can inhibit the expression of some important immune-related genes to escape immune defense.
Herein, we briefly depict the possible role of G-quadruplexes in the antiviral mechanism and
pathogenicity, and the development of certain G-quadruplex specific ligands might be a promising
antiviral strategy (Fig. 6). We call for more researchers to shed light on the relationship between Gquadruplexes and coronaviruses. Only if we have a deeper understanding of coronaviruses can we
better cope with the possible novel coronavirus pandemics in the future.

Fig. 6 Possible role of G-quadruplexes in the antiviral mechanism and pathogenicity. Left part, Gquadruplexes can function as inhibition elements in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Both the replication
and translation could be affected by the G-quadruplexes structures. The stable G-quadruplexes in
the 3' end of the negative-sense strand may interfere with the activity of RdRp; hence, the replication
of the negative-sense strands to the positive-sense strands is repressed, so that the SARS-CoV-2
genomes cannot be produced in large quantities. The G-quadruplex structures can suppress the
translation process by impairing the elongating of ribosomes, which can hinder the production of
proteins required for the virus. The G-quadruplex structures could be stabilized by the specific
ligands to enhance the inhibitory effects, which is a promising antiviral strategy. Right part, a
possible mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to impede the expression of human genes. G-quadruplex
structures, particularly with longer G-stretches, are the potential binding targets for SUD-like

proteins. And the interaction of the SUD-like proteins with G-quadruplex structures possibly lead
to the instability of host transcripts or obstructing the translation efficiency.

Methods
Data collection
We obtained a total of 77 full-length bat-associated beta coronaviruses from the DBatVir
(http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DBatVir/) database[76]. We also downloaded the bat coronavirus RaTG13
genome from the NCBI virus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/),
which has shown a high sequence similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome in previous
reports. We acquired the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome from the NCBI virus database under the
accession number of NC_045512. In addition to those sequences, nine pangolin coronaviruses were
derived from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) database[77].
Pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic and conservation analysis
The EMBOSS Needle software, which is based on the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and, is a part
of the EMBL-EBI web tools[78], was employed for the pairwise sequence alignment. Clustal
Omega[79, 80] is a reliable and accurate multiple sequence alignment (MSA) tool that can be
performed on large data sets. We choose this MSA tool for the alignment of viral genomes and the
alignment of protein sequences under the default paraments. UGENE[81] is a powerful and userfriendly bioinformatics software, and we choose UGENE to visualize the pairwise and multiple
sequence alignment results. We used the MEGA X software[82] to construct the Neighbor-Joining
phylogenetic tree with 1,000 bootstrap replications. To depict the conservation state for each
nucleotide site, the GERP++ software[83] was applied to calculate the “Rejected Substitutions”
score column by column, which can reflect the constraints strength for each nucleotide sites.
Potential G-quadruplex detection
Several open-source G-quadruplex detection software was used to search the PG4s both in the
SARS-CoV-2 positive-sense and negative-sense strands. G4CatchAll[84], pqsfinder[85], and
QGRS Mapper[86] were employed to predict the putative G-quadruplexes, respectively; Please see
ref[87] for more information about the comparison of those tools mentioned above. The minimum
G-tract length was set to two in the three software, while the max length of the predicted Gquadruplexes was limited to 30. Specifically, the minimum score of the predicted G-quadruplex was
set to 10 when using pqsfinder. We utilized BEDTools[88] to sort the PG4s according to their
coordinates. Apart from this, we adopted the cG/cC scoring system[54] proposed by Jean-Pierre
Perreault et al. to delineate the sequence context influence on PG4s. The PG4s along with 15 nt
upstream and downstream sequence contexts were used to calculate cG/cC score, and 2.05 was
taken as the threshold for the preliminary inference of the G-quadruplex folding capability[54].
Using a customized python script, we implemented the cG/cC scoring system.
Homo-dimer homology modeling and electrostatic potential calculation
The SARS-CoV-2 SUDcore-like homo-dimer structure was modeled based on the template of the
SARS-CoV SUD structure (PDB ID: 2W2G) through homology modeling. All the modeling process
were performed in the Swiss Model[89] website (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). The electrostatic

potential was calculated and visualized in the PyMOL software by using the APBS (Adaptive
Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) plugin.
ΔG°z-score analysis
The Δ G ° z-score for the SARS-CoV-2 genome was retrieved from RNAStructuromeDB
(https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2). The ΔG°z-score is described as follows.
������𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 )
(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 − 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
(1)
𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺°𝑧𝑧 − 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 =
𝜎𝜎
Where the 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 means the MFE (minimum free energy) ΔG° value predicted by the
RNAfold software with a window of 120 nt and step of one nt. And the ������
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 represents the
MFE ΔG° value generated by the randomly shuffled sequence with the identical nucleotide
composition. The 𝜎𝜎 is the standard deviation across all the MFE values.
To depict the ΔG°z-score for each nucleotide in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we utilized the
following formula.
∑𝑤𝑤
𝑚𝑚=1 ΔG°z − score𝑚𝑚
(2)
𝑤𝑤
Where z𝑖𝑖 is the average ΔG°z-score for nucleotide 𝑖𝑖, 𝑤𝑤 denotes the total number of the sliding
z𝑖𝑖 =

windows that covering the nucleotide 𝑖𝑖. ΔG°z − score𝑚𝑚 indicates the ΔG°z-score for the mth window. For example, when considering the nucleotide 1000 under the setting of 120 nt window
length and one nt step, there are 120 sliding windows covering the nucleotide 1000. So, the z200 ,
which means the average ΔG°z-score for nucleotide 200, is calculated as the sum of theΔG°zscore of 120 sliding windows divided by the total number of the sliding windows.
