The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-

5

CoV-2, has elicited a global health crisis of catastrophic proportions.

6

With no approved cure or vaccine currently available, there is a crit-

7

ical need for effective antiviral strategies. In this study, we report

8

a novel antiviral platform, through computational design of ACE2-

9

derived peptides which both target the viral spike protein receptor

10

binding domain (RBD) and recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases for subse-

11

quent intracellular degradation of SARS-CoV-2 in the proteasome.

12

Our engineered peptide fusions demonstrate robust RBD degrada-

13

tion capabilities in human cells, thus prompting their further exper-

14

imental characterization and therapeutic development.

Introduction

16

SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a highly pathogenic coronavirus that has now spread to over

17

200 countries, infecting nearly 6 million people worldwide and killing over 350,000 as of

18

May 2020 (1). Economies have crashed, travel restrictions have been imposed, and pub1

lic gatherings have been cancelled, all while a sizeable portion of the human population

20

remains quarantined. Rapid transmission dynamics as well as a wide range of symptoms,

21

from a simple dry cough to pneumonia and death, are common characteristics of coron-

22

avirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2). With no vaccine or cure readily available (3), there

23

is a pressing need for robust and effective therapeutics targeting the virus.

24

25

Numerous antiviral strategies have been proposed to limit SARS-CoV-2 replication by

26

preventing viral infection and synthesis (4). As SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA

27

virus, Abbott, et al. recently devised a CRISPR-Cas13d based strategy, termed PAC-

28

MAN, to simultaneously degrade the positive-sense genome and viral mRNAs (5). While

29

this method may serve as a potential prophylactic treatment, introducing foreign and rel-

30

atively large components such as Cas13 enzymes into human cells in vivo presents various

31

delivery and safety challenges (6).

32

33

The most rapid and acute method of protein degradation intracellularly is at the post-

34

translational level. Specifically, E3 ubiquitin ligases can tag endogenous proteins for

35

subsequent degradation in the proteasome (7). Thus, we hypothesize that by guiding E3

36

ubiquitin ligases to synthesized viral protein components, one can mediate depletion of

37

SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, preventing further infection and replication.

38

39

In this study, we devise a targeted intracellular degradation strategy for SARS-CoV-2

40

by computationally designing peptides that bind to its spike (S) protein receptor bind-

41

ing domain (RBD) and recruit a human E3 ubiquitin ligase for subsequent proteasomal

42

degradation. Our experimental results identify an optimal peptide variant that can medi-

43

ate robust degradation of the RBD fused to a stable superfolder-green fluorescent protein

47

Computationally-Optimized Peptides Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

48

Since the 2003 SARS epidemic, it has been widely known that the angiotensin-converting

49

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells (9). ACE2 is a

50

monocarboxypeptidase, widely known for cleaving various peptides within the renin–angiotensin

51

system (10). Functionally, there are two forms of ACE2. The full-length ACE2 contains a

52

structural transmembrane domain, which anchors its extracellular domain to the plasma

53

membrane. The extracellular domain has been demonstrated as a receptor for the S

54

protein of SARS-CoV, and recently, for that of SARS-CoV-2 (11). The soluble form of

55

ACE2 lacks the membrane anchor, thus preserving binding capacity, and circulates in

56

small amounts in the blood (12).

57

58

Recently, it has been shown that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) can serve as a competitive inter-

59

ceptor of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses by preventing binding of the viral particle

60

to the endogenous ACE2 transmembrane protein, and thus viral entry (13). sACE2,

61

however, is capable of binding other biological molecules in vivo, most notably integrin

62

receptors (14). Furthermore, it is critical that therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 epi-

63

topes withstand the possibility of viral mutation, which may allow the virus to overcome

64

the host adaptive immune response (15). We thus conducted in silico protein modeling

65

to engineer minimal sACE2 peptides that not only maintain potent RBD binding, but

66

also possess reduced off-target interaction with the integrin α5β1 receptor, and exhibit

67

cross-binding affinity toward the previous SARS-CoV spike protein, thus demonstrating

tolerance to viral evolution (Figure 1A).

69

70

To do this, we retrieved a structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to sACE2 from

71

the Protein Data Bank (PDB 6M0J) (16). We first utilized the PeptiDerive protocol (17)

72

in the Rosetta protein modeling software (18) to generate truncated linear sACE2 peptide

73

segments between 10 to 150 amino acids with significant binding energy compared to that

74

of the full SARS-CoV-2-sACE2-RBD interaction. To analyze the conformational entropy

75

of the peptide segments in the binding pocket, we employed both the FlexPepDock and

76

Protein-Protein protocols (19) to dock the peptides to the original RBD (Figure 1B.i).

77

To ensure tolerance to potential mutations in the RBD, we docked peptides with optimal

78

binding energies against the divergent 2003 SARS-CoV RBD bound with ACE2 (PDB

79

2AJF) (20) (Figure 1B.ii). Peptides that demonstrated highest binding energy for SARS-

80

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were then docked against the α5β1 integrin ectodomain

81

(PDB 3VI4) (21) to identify weak off-target binders (Figure 1B.iii). After applying these

82

filters, 26 candidate peptides were selected from a total list of 188 initial peptides (Figure

83

1C).

84

Targeted Degradation of RBD with TRIM21

85

TRIM21 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds with high affinity to the Fc domain of

86

antibodies and recruits the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade targeted proteins (22)

87

Recently, the Trim-Away technique was developed for acute and rapid degradation of

88

endogenous proteins, by co-expressing TRIM21 with an anti-target antibody (23). We

89

thus hypothesized that by fusing the Fc domain to the C-terminus of candidate peptides

90

and co-expressing TRIM21, we can mediate degradation of the RBD fused to a stable

91

fluorescent marker, such as superfolder GFP (8) (RBD-sfGFP), in human HEK293T cells

92

using a simple plasmid-based assay (Figure 2A and 2B). We chose the two most compact

93

candidate peptides, an 18-mer and 23-mer derived from the ACE2 peptidase domain α1

94

helix, which is composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids, as well as the candidate

95

peptide computationally predicted to have highest binding affinity to the RBD (a 148-

96

mer), for testing alongside sACE2 (Figure 1C). We also tested a recently-engineered 23-

97

mer peptide from Zhang, et al., purporting to have strong RBD-binding capabilities (24).

98

Five days post-transfection, we analyzed the degradation of the RBD-sfGFP complex by

99

flow cytometry. After confirming negligible baseline depletion of GFP+ signal with and

100

without exogenous TRIM21 expression, as well as no off-target degradation of sfGFP

101

unbound to the RBD, we observed over 30% reduction of GFP+ cells treated with full-

102

length sACE2 fused to Fc and co-expressed with TRIM21, as compared to the RBD-

103

sfGFP-only control. Of the tested peptides, only the 23-mer demonstrated comparable

104

levels of degradation, with nearly 20% reduction in GFP+ cells (Figure 2C).

106

Engineering of an Optimal Peptide-Based Degradation Architecture

107

Recently, deep mutational scans have been conducted on sACE2 to identify variants with

108

higher binding affinity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (25). Similarly, we conducted a com-

109

plete single point mutational scan for all 23 positions in the peptide using the ddG-backrub

110

script in Rosetta to identify mutants with improved binding affinity (26). For each muta-

111

tion, 30,000 backrub trials were performed to sample conformational diversity. The top

112

eight mutations predicted by this protocol were chosen for the experimental assay (Figure

113

3A.i), along with the top eight mutations predicted using an Rosetta energy function opti-

114

mized for predicting the effect of mutations on protein-protein binding (26) (Figure 3A.ii),

115

as well as the top eight mutational sites within the 23-mer sequence from deep mutational

116

scans of sACE2 (25) (Figure 3A.iii). Our results in the subsequent TRIM21 assay identi-

117

fied A2N, derived from the original Rosetta energy function, as the optimal mutation in

118

the 23-mer peptide, which achieved over 50% depletion of GFP+ cells, improving on both

119

the sACE2 and 23-mer architecture as well as that of a previously optimized full-length

120

mutant, sACE2v2.4 (Figure 3B).

121

122

Finally, numerous previous works have attempted to redirect E3 ubiquitin ligases by

123

replacing their natural protein binding domains with those targeting specific proteins

124

(27–29). In 2014, Portnoff, et al., reprogrammed the substrate specificity of a modular

125

human E3 ubiquitin ligase called CHIP (carboxyl-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein)

126

by replacing its natural substrate-binding domain with designer binding proteins to gen-

127

erate optimized “ubiquibodies” or uAbs (30). To engineer a single construct that can

128

mediate SARS-CoV-2 degradation without the need for trans expression of TRIM21, we

129

fused the RBD-binding proteins to the CHIP∆TPR modified E3 ubiquitin ligase domain

130

(Figure 3C). After co-transfection in HEK293T cells with the RBD-sfGFP complex, we

131

observed that the 23-mer (A2N) mutant peptide maintained equivalent levels of degra-

132

dation between the TRIM21 and CHIP∆TPR fusion architecture, and was more potent

133

than that of sACE2, sACE2v2.4, and the original 23mer (Figure 3D).

134

Discussion

135

In this study, we have computationally truncated and engineered the human ACE2 re-

136

ceptor sequence to potently bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We have further identified

137

an optimized peptide variant that enables robust degradation of RBD-sfGFP complexes

138

in human cells, both in trans and in cis with human E3 ubiquitin ligases. This mutant

139

peptide not only maintains high binding affinity to the RBD, but is also predicted to bind

140

to divergent RBD sequences in the case of future mutation as SARS-CoV-2 continues on

141

its evolutionary trajectory. We also predict that the peptide will avoid binding to integrin

142

α5β1, thus preventing interference of critical cellular pathways.

143

144

While many further improvements and testing contexts are needed, there may be certain

145

advantages to our platform as compared to the PAC-MAN strategy presented recently (5).

146

First, both the peptide and E3 ubiquitin ligase components have been engineered from

147

endogenous human proteins, unlike Cas13d, which is derived from Ruminococcus flave-

148

faciens bacteria, thus potentially reducing the risk of immunogenicity. In terms of in

149

vivo delivery as RNA or recombinant protein, Cas13d has an open reading frame (ORF)

150

of nearly 1000 amino acids, not including the guide RNAs needed for interference. The

151

entire peptide-CHIP∆TPR ORF consists of just over 200 amino acids, which can be

152

readily synthesized as a peptide or be efficiently packaged for delivery in a lipid nanopar-

153

ticle or adeno-associated virus (AAV). Similarly, the peptide-CHIP∆TPR complex can

154

be utilized as a viral interceptor extracellularly, as it can competitively bind the RBD to

155

prevent entry via ACE2. In the case that SARS-CoV-2 still infects the cell while bound

156

to peptide-CHIP∆TPR, the virus would be immediately tagged for degradation in the

157

proteasome.

158

159

In total, we envision that the strategy of utilizing a computationally-designed peptide

160

binder linked to an E3 ubiquitin ligase can be explored not only for SARS-CoV-2, but

161

also for other viruses that have known binding partners. Thus with further experimental

162

characterization, the system presented here provides a potential new therapeutic platform

163

in the fight against COVID-19 and future emergent viral threats.

165

Computational Peptide Design Pipeline

166

PDB Structure 6M0J containing the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-

167

binding domain (RBD) bound with ACE2 was retrieved (16). The PeptiDerive proto-

168

col (17) in the Rosetta protein modeling software (18) was used to determine the linear

169

peptide segments between 10 to 150 amino acids with significant binding energy compared

170

to that of the whole SARS-CoV-2-ACE2-RBD interaction. To analyze the conformational

171

entropy of the peptide segments in the binding pocket, a combination of FlexPepDock

172

and Protein-Protein docking protocols (19) in Rosetta was used to dock the peptides to

173

the original receptor binding domain. All peptides were placed in the binding pocket of

174

SARS-CoV-2 RBD for local docking. Using FlexPepDock, 300 models were created for

175

each peptide and the top 15 models were selected to calculate the score. The peptides with

176

the best binding energies were docked against SARS-CoV RBD bound with ACE2 using

177

PDB 2AJF (20) containing the crystal structure of SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding

178

domain (RBD) bound with ACE2. Peptides that demonstrated highest binding energy

179

for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were docked against the α5β1 integrin ectodomain

180

using the crystal structure provided by PDB 3VI4 (21).

182

The 23-mer peptide that showed high experimental binding affinity was selected for com-

184

positions in the peptide using ddG-backrub script in Rosetta. For each mutation, 30,000

185

186

by this protocol were chosen for the experimental assay, along with the top 8 mutations

Figure 2: TRIM21-mediated Degradation of RBD via Peptide Targeting. A) Architecture and
mechanism of TRIM21-based degradation system. The Fc domain is fused to the C-terminus of RBDtargeting peptides. TRIM21 recognizes the Fc domain and tags SARS-CoV-2 for ubiquitin-mediated
degradation in the proteasome. B) Three plasmid assay used to experimentally validate degradation
architecture in human HEK293T cells. All CDS are inserted into the pcDNA3.1 backbone. C) Analysis
of RBD-sfGFP degradation by flow cytometry, in the absence or presence of Fc (in cis), TRIM21 (in
trans), or both. All samples were performed in independent transfection duplicates (n=2) and gated
on GFP+ fluorescence. Mean percentage of GFP+ cell depletion was calculated in comparison to the
RBD-sfGFP only control. Standard deviation was used to calculate error bars.

Figure 3: Engineering of Optimal RBD Degradation Architecture. A) (i) ddG of 23-mer mutations predicted by Rosetta with the default energy function, (ii) ddG of 23-mer mutations predicted by
Rosetta with the energy function from Barlow et al. (26), (iii) log2fc enrichment scores of mutations of
sACE2 within the 23-mer sequence experimentally determined by Procko (25). All binding affinity scores
have been re-scaled to 0 (highest) to 1 (lowest) for visualization. Original amino acids are indicated on
the y-axes. B) Analysis of RBD-sfGFP degradation by flow cytometry. All samples were performed in
independent transfection duplicates (n=2) and gated on GFP+ fluorescence. All indicated samples were
co-transfected with RBD-sfGFP and TRIM21 in trans, and mean percentage of GFP+ cell depletion
was calculated in comparison to the RBD-sfGFP-only control. Standard deviation was used to calculate
error bars. 23-mer mutations are underlined according to origin. C) Architecture and mechanism of
CHIP∆TPR-based degradation system. CHIP∆TPR is fused to the C-terminus of RBD-targeting petpides. CHIP∆TPR can thus tag SARS-CoV-2 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the proteasome. D)
Analysis of RBD-sfGFP degradation by flow cytometry in the presence of Fc (in cis) and TRIM21 (in
trans) or CHIP∆TPR (in cis). All samples were performed in independent transfection duplicates (n=2)
and gated on GFP+ fluorescence. Mean percentage of GFP+ cell depletion was calculated in comparison
to the RBD-sfGFP only control. Standard deviation was used to calculate error bars.
