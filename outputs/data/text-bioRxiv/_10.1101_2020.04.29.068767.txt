Abstract
The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) class of polysaccharides are utilised by a plethora of microbial
pathogens as receptors for adherence and invasion. The GAG heparin prevents infection by a
range of viruses when added exogenously, including the S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1
and more recently we have demonstrated that heparin can block cellular invasion by SARSCoV-2. Heparin has found widespread clinical use as anticoagulant drug and this molecule is
routinely used as a proxy for the GAG, heparan sulphate (HS), a structural analogue located on
the cell surface, which is a known receptor for viral invasion. Previous work has demonstrated
that unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins binds to the Spike (S1) protein
receptor binding domain, inducing distinct conformational change and we have further explored
the structural features of heparin with regard to these interactions. In this article, previous
research is expanded to now include a broader range of GAG family members, including
heparan sulphate. This research demonstrates that GAGs, other than those of heparin (or its
derivatives), can also interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 receptor binding domain and
induce distinct conformational changes within this region. These findings pave the way for future
research into next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2
and other members of the Coronaviridae.

Introduction
The glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are polydisperse, heterogeneous natural products
that are exploited as pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. Clinically, unfractionated
heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and heparinoids are approved
as anticoagulants/thrombotics with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability and
pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, GAGs and their derivatives, some of which lacking
significant anticoagulant activity1, are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite
possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including
coronaviridae and SARS- associated coronaviruses2,3, in addition to flaviviruses4,5,
herpes6, influenza7 and HIV8,9.
Traditional drug development processes are slow and ineffective against emerging
public health threats such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which
makes the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative. Heparin, a
well-tolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over
80 years and alongside its anticoagulant activities, this biomolecule possesses the
ability to prevent viral infection, including from members of the coronaviridae1.
Furthermore, the closely related glycosaminoglycan (GAG) member, heparan sulfate
(HS), is known to bind CoV surface proteins and to be used by coronavirus for its
attachment to target cells10.
Currently, there is a dearth of commercially available medicinal products designed to
treat and/or prevent infections associated with the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
outbreak. Here, we describe preliminary observations for the ability of the SARS-CoV2 S1 RBD to interact with a broad range of GAGs, in addition to those previously
demonstrated for UFH and LMWH2.

Methods & Materials
2.1 Recombinant expression of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
Residues 330−583 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (GenBank: MN908947) were
cloned upstream of a N-terminal 6XHisTag in the pRSETA expression vector and
transformed into SHuffle® T7 Express Competent E. coli (NEB, UK). Protein expression
was carried out in MagicMedia™ E. coli Expression Media (Invitrogen, UK) at 30°C for
24 hrs, 250 rpm. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 5 mL lysis buffer (BugBuster
Protein Extraction Reagent, Merck Millipore, UK; containing DNAse) and incubated at
room temperature for 30 mins. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies using IMAC
chromatography under denaturing conditions. On-column protein refolding was
performed by applying a gradient with decreasing concentrations of the denaturing agent
(6 - 0 M Urea). After extensive washing, protein was eluted using 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH
8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged to
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH
7.4; Lonza, UK) using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, UK). Recombinant
protein was stored at -20°C until required.
2.2 Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD by circular dichroism
spectroscopy

The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in PBS was recorded
using a J-1500 Jasco CD spectrometer (Jasco, UK), Spectral Manager II software
(JASCO, UK) and a 0.2 mm pathlength, quartz cuvette (Hellma, USA) scanning at 100
nm.min-1 with 1 nm resolution throughout the range λ = 190 - 260 nm. All spectra obtained
were the mean of five independent scans, following instrument calibration with
camphorsulfonic acid. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to spectral
analysis) using a 5 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at 12,000 g, thrice
and CD spectra were collected using 21 μl of a 0.6 mg.ml-1 solution in PBS, pH 7.4.
Spectra of glycosaminoglycans were collected in the same buffer at approximately
comparable concentrations, since these are disperse materials. Collected data were
analysed with Spectral Manager II software prior to processing with GraphPad Prism 7,
using second order polynomial smoothing through 21 neighbours. Secondary structural
prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server11.To ensure that the CD
spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of GAGs did not arise from
simply from the addition of the GAG spectra (this class of carbohydrates are known to
possess CD spectrum at high concentrations12,13), difference spectra were analysed for
each GAG in order to verify that the change in the CD spectrum arose from a
conformational change following binding to the test GAG.

Results
3.1 Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein by
circular dichroism spectroscopy.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy detects changes in protein secondary structure
that occur in solution using UV radiation. Upon binding, conformational changes are
detected and quantified using spectral deconvolution14. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD
underwent conformational change in the presence of GAGs (Figures 1 - 6). These
observed changes further demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts with
not only UFH and LMWHs, but also other members of the GAG family of carbohydrates.

Discussion and Conclusion
The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant challenge to global health
authorities. As there are currently no approved drugs to treat, prevent and/or mitigate
the effects of SARS-CoV-2, repurposing existing pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals is
both a timely and appealing strategy. Glycosaminoglycans are generally well-tolerated
and have been used successfully for many years with limited and manageable side
effects.
Studying the structure and behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in solution is a vital
step for the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Here, the ability
of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to interact with glycosaminoglycans has been studied
using circular dichroism. The data show that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts with GAGs
other than UFH/LMWH and induces significant structural change.
Glycosaminoglycans are ubiquitously present on almost all mammalian cells and this
class of carbohydrates are central to the strategy employed by coronaviridae to attach
to host cells. Heparin has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-associated
coronavirus cell invasion2,3,15 and this, in concert with the GAG-based data presented
within this study, supports the utilisation of GAG-derived therapeutics against SARSassociated coronavirus.
It is noteworthy that the vast majority of commercially available GAG preparations
remain a polydisperse mixture of natural products, containing both anticoagulant and
non-anticoagulant saccharide structures. These may prove to be an invaluable resource
for next-generation, biologically active, antiviral agents that display negligible
anticoagulant potential, whilst the former remains tractable to facile, chemical (and
enzymatic) engineering strategies to ablate their anticoagulation activities.
The further subfractionation of extant GAG preparations against anticoagulant activities
(with proven low-toxicity profiles, good bioavailability and industrial-scale
manufacturing) for off-label pathologies, provides an attractive strategy for quickly and
effectively responding to COVID-19 and for the development of next generation GAGbased therapeutics.
Such drugs will be amenable to routine parenteral administration through currently
established routes and additionally, direct to the respiratory tract via nasal
administration, using nebulised heparin, which would be unlikely to gain significant
access to the circulation. Thus, the anticoagulant activity of some GAGs, which can in
any event be engineered out, would not pose a problem. Importantly, such a route of
administration would not only be suitable for prophylaxis, but also for patients under
mechanical ventilation16.
