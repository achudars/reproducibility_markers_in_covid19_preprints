ABSTRACT
The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its receptor binding domain (RBD), and its primary receptor
ACE2 are extensively glycosylated. The impact of this post-translational modification on viral
entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in
CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.
We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding.
However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan
biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule
kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking Oglycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles
for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spikeprotein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2
and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for
COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing the global pandemic ‘coronavirus diseases 2019’
(COVID-19). This is a zoonotic beta-coronavirus from bats that causes severe acute respiratory
syndrome (1). Its effects on human physiology extends well beyond the lung as it unleashes a
cytokine storm to alter immune response (2) and cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (3).
It also exhibits multiorgan tropism that impacts kidney, liver, heart and brain function (4). Among
its structural elements, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is critical for viral attachment, fusion and
entry into host (5-7). The RBD region of Spike enables binding to its primary human cellular
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is ubiquitously expressed on epithelial,
endothelial and blood cells (6, 8). A role for heparan sulfates in viral entry has also been proposed
(9). Once bound, viral fusion and entry depends on two proteolysis sites, the furin/RRAR-S site
located between the Spike S1 and S2 subunits, and a second S2’/SKR-S site (10). A variety of
enzymes including TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) and cathepsin-L may aid viral
entry (11-13). While inhibitors of viral binding, RNA transcription and protease activity are being
tested to reduce viral load, this manuscript suggests an orthogonal approach based on glycan
engineering.
Both the viral Spike-protein and ACE2 receptor are extensively glycosylated, with a
majority of the 22 N-glycosylation sites of Spike and 7 N-glycosylation sites of ACE2 bearing
carbohydrates ((14-16), Figure 1). The exact distribution of the oligomannose, hybrid, complex,
sialylated and fucosylated structures in these macromolecules is likely dictated both by the protein
structure and host expression system (17, 18). O-linked glycans are also reported on both proteins
(16, 17). A variety of functions have been proposed for these glycans including immunological
shielding (18), direct regulation of Spike-ACE2 binding (19), and control of Spike up/down

conformation (20). Experimental data supporting these concepts is currently lacking and thus our
understanding of the impact of glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 function is incomplete.
We address the above gaps in knowledge in the current manuscript. Our results suggest
that both the O- and N-linked glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, including sialylated
glycan epitopes, have a relatively minor role in regulating direct Spike-ACE2 binding interactions.
However, these glycans control the rates of viral entry into HEK293T cells expressing human
ACE2. Here, blocking N-glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at the high-mannose stage
using CRISPR-Cas9 and also a small molecule inhibitor (kifunensine) resulted in extensive
cleavage/shedding of the viral Spike protein at the time of production due to enhanced proteolysis
at the S1-S2 interface. Our data also suggest that glycans may contribute to additional aspects of
Spike proteolysis during viral entry. Due to these effects, viral entry into human ACE2 expressing
cells was reduced by >95 % when virus was produced in the CRISPR-Cas9 MGAT-1 knockout
cells lacking complex N-glycans, and by 85-90 % upon production in the presence of kifunensine.
These observations support the need to screen chemical inhibitors of glycosylation for the
treatment of COVID-19.

RESULTS
Modest role for ACE2 sialic acids during Spike protein molecular recognition
In order to study the impact of N- and O-linked glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 function,
we engineered cells over-expressing full-length Spike-protein and ACE2 (Figure 2A). We also
histidine-tag purified soluble, dimeric Fc-his fusion proteins for the Spike S1 region, RBD and
extracellular portion of ACE2. The molecules were extensively glycosylated with their apparent
molecular mass being greater than their theoretical mass based on peptide alone. Thus, RBD-Fc
was ~60 kDa instead of a theoretical mass of 51 kDa, S1-Fc was ~150 kDa rather than 101 kDa,
and ACE2-Fc was ~140 kDa instead of 110 kDa (Figure 2B). RBD-Fc and S1-Fc readily bound to
HEK293T cells upon human ACE2 over-expression, confirming that they are functionally active
(Figure 2C). ACE2-Fc also specifically bound Spike-protein expressed on 293Ts. Baseline RBDFc and S1-Fc binding to Spike expressing 293T cells (i.e. 293T/S) was even lower than that of
wild-type 293T (red line, Figure 2C). This suggests expression of low amounts of Spike binding
proteins on WT-293Ts. These basal Spike receptors may engage cell-surface Spike on 293T/S cell
(via cis-interactions) causing RBD-Fc and S1-Fc binding to be lower in 293T/S cells compared to
WT-293Ts.
Sialidase treatment of Spike-protein expressed on 293Ts did not affect ACE2-Fc binding
(Figure 2D). Sialidase treatment of ACE2 expressed on 293Ts, however, increased RBD-Fc and
S1-Fc binding by 26 % and 56 % respectively. Control lectin binding studies confirmed the high
activity of the sialidase enzyme used in this study (Figure 2-figure supplement 1A). The relatively
small effect of the sialidase in these studies was not due to the absence of sialic acid on either S1Fc or ACE2-Fc. In this regard, independent glycoprotemics mass spectrometry (MS) data showed
that ~80-100% of the N-glycans expressed at specific sites of ACE2-Fc and ~40-100% of the S1Fc glycopeptides expressed complex-type glycans (K.C., et al., manuscript in preparation). Up to

~60% of the antennae on these complex structures on ACE2 and ~20% of the structures on S1-Fc
were terminated by sialic acid.

Neither sialidase treatment of Spike nor ACE2 markedly impacted viral entry
To complement the above binding studies, we measured SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry
into stable 293T/ACE2 cells. This assay provides an aggregate measure of both molecular binding
and viral fusion/entry in the context of the physiological Spike trimeric configuration (21). Here,
the control VSVG (Vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein) pseudotyped virus displayed broad
tropism both for wild-type HEK293T and stable 293T/ACE2 (Figure 2E, Figure 2-figure
supplement 1B). Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein virus (‘Spike-WT’) only entered
293T/ACE2 cells confirming the strict dependence on cell surface ACE2 receptor. A ‘Spikemutant’ pseudovirus, where the ‘RRAR’ furin site was swapped with an ‘SRAS’ sequence, also
only entered 293T/ACE2 (22). This mutation results in reduced proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface,
as discussed later, likely due to the presence of a single arginine site at the S1-S2 interface rather
than the polybasic (‘RRAR’) sequence. To study the role of sialic acid on viral entry, we titered
the Spike-WT and Spike-mutant virus using p24 ELISA (Figure 2-figure supplement 2). The virus
were then treated with a pan-sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens, and the same amount of
Spike-WT and Spike-mutant particles were applied to stable 293T/ACE2 cells (Figure 2F, Figure
2-figure supplement 1C). Here, Spike-mutant pseudotyped virus was ~5-10 times more effective
at stimulating DsRed reporter expression compared to Spike-WT. Thus, the efficiency of cleavage
at the S1-S2 interface can fine-tune SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (11, 13, 14). Sialidase treatment of
virus did not impact viral entry, consistent with the notion that Spike sialic acid does not regulate
molecular recognition. Additionally, sialidase treatment of 293T/ACE2 did not alter either VSVG

or Spike-WT pseudovirus entry (Figure 2G, Figure 2-figure supplement 1D). A partial increase in
Spike-mutant viral entry was measured upon sialidase treatment (P=0.08), suggesting a minor
inhibitory role for ACE2 sialic acid when viral infectivity is high. Glycoproteomics analysis of
purified pseudovirus produced in HEK293T cells showed that ~45-100% of the viral N-glycans
were complex-type, with up to ~55% of their antennae being terminated by sialic acid (K.C., et al.
manuscript in preparation). Thus, the pseudovirus used in this study was processed by
glycoenzymes that are typically found in the cellular medial and trans-Golgi compartments.
Together, the binding and pseudovirus data suggest that ACE2 sialic acids may modestly shield
virus/Spike binding in some biological contexts and perhaps some cell systems.

Blocking Spike protein N-glycan biosynthesis at the high-mannose stage partially reduced
ACE2 binding
To determine if other aspects of N- and O-linked glycosylation may impact SARS-CoV-2
function, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 technology to develop isogenic HEK293T clones that lack
either the core-1 O-glycan forming galactosyltransferase C1GalT1 or the N-glycan branching
β1,2GlcNAc-transferase MGAT1 (Figure 3A, (23, 24)). Here, knocking out C1GalT1 blocks Oglycan biosynthesis at the GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (+/-sialic acid) stage as it is not elaborated to form
the core-1 structure (Galβ1,3GalNAcα). These cells are termed ‘[O]¯293T’. Knocking out
MGAT1 blocks N-glycan biosynthesis at the Man-5 stage, and the resulting clone is called
‘[N]¯293T’. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three C1GalT1 alleles of [O]¯293T contained
indels (Figure 3B). Frameshift mutation was also noted at the single MGAT1 allele in [N]¯293T.
As anticipated, VVA-lectin (Vicia villosa agglutinin) binding to GalNAcα was dramatically
augmented in the [O]¯293Ts (Figure 3C). Complex glycans were absent in [N]¯293Ts as they did

not engage PHA-L (lectin from Phaseolus vulgaris). Additional data with a panel of fluorescent
lectins further confirm specific blockade of N-glycan complex structures and lactosamine chains
in [N]¯293T, and inhibition of O-glycan extension in the [O]¯293T cells (Figure 3-figure
supplement 1). Together, the findings confirm the absence of O- and N-glycan elaboration in the
[O]¯293T/C1GalT1-KO and [N]¯293T/MGAT1-KO cells, respectively.
Wild type 293Ts and the glycoenzyme knockouts were transiently transfected to express
Spike and ACE2 for binding studies. Both full-length proteins expressed well and at equal levels
in the different cell systems (Figure 3-figure supplement 2A). In order to quantify the effect of
glycosylation on ACE2-Spike binding, ACE2-Fc was applied to Spike bearing cells, either 293T
or the O/N-glycan knockouts (Figure 3D). Similarly, either S1-Fc (Figure 3E) or RBD-Fc (Figure
3F) were applied to ACE2 bearing 293T or the N-/O-glycan knockouts. These Fc-proteins were
applied at sub-saturation concentrations in the cytometry binding studies in order to quantitatively
evaluate differences in receptor-ligand binding. Here, we observed a 40% decrease in ACE2-Fc
binding to cell-surface Spike expressed on [N]¯293Ts, and a slight 20% increase when Spike was
expressed on the [O]¯293Ts (Figure 3D). Glycan engineering of ACE2 in the [O]¯ and [N]¯293Ts
did not impact either S1-Fc (Figure 3E) or RBD-Fc binding (Figure 3F). Here, RBD-Fc bound
~10-times more avidly to ACE2 compared to S1-Fc. Together, the data suggest a modest role for
Spike-protein glycosylation on direct Spike-ACE2 binding. Our observation that the binding of
RBD for ACE2 was substantially higher than S1-ACE2 interactions is consistent with a previous
report (13). This highlights the need to carefully consider RBD presentation/conformation in the
context of the full protein when quantifying molecular affinity to ACE2.

Blocking N-glycan elaboration on Spike abrogated viral entry
We evaluated the impact of ACE2 and Spike glycosylation on viral entry. To determine
the impact of ACE2 glycosylation, we transiently expressed this protein on wild-type 293Ts,
[O]‾293Ts and [N]‾293Ts. The entry of the pseudovirus (VSVG, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant) to
these three cell types was then evaluated (Figure 3G, Figure 3-figure supplement 2B). Here, the
pattern of viral entry was similar in all cell systems. Lower entry was measured for Spike-WT and
Spike-mutant pseudovirus infection of [O]‾293T/ACE2 cells, but this was also noted for the
control VSVG-virus. Thus, this reduced infectivity in the O-glycan knockout is not exclusively
due to ACE2 glycans. We conclude that ACE2 glycans may not regulate viral entry.
In contrast to ACE2, glycan engineering of viral Spike protein dramatically affected viral
entry (Figure 4). To study this, VSVG, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant pseudotyped virus were
generated in wild-type 293T, [O]‾293T and [N]‾293T (Figure 4A). All 9 viruses were used to
infect stable 293T/ACE2 cells. When produced in [O]‾293T, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant
pseudovirus resulted in a 70-85 % loss in DsRed fluorescence (Figure 4B), and a partial reduction
(35-70 %) in the fraction of DsRed positive cells (Figure 4C). In stark contrast, knocking out Nglycans in both pseudoviruses abrogated viral infection into 293T/ACE2 cells by >95% (Figure
4B, 4C). Dose studies confirmed loss of viral function upon inhibiting N-glycan elaboration over
a range of viral titers (Figure 4D). This was observed for the Spike-mutant and also the Spike-WT
pseudovirus (data not shown). Western blot with anti-S2 pAb (polyclonal antibody) suggest that
both the Spike-WT and Spike-mutant virus expressed comparable levels of Spike protein,
regardless of the glycosylation mutation (Figure 4E). The molecular mass of Spike expressed in
[N]‾293T was lower than that of other virus consistent with the extensive N-glycosylation of this
protein. Additionally, the data suggest more extensive cleavage of Spike-WT compared to Spike-

mutant, consistent with the presence of the proteolysis-sensitive polybasic furin-site in Spike-WT.
The Spike pseudovirus produced in [N]‾293Ts also appeared to have lower intact Spike protein.
To examine this more closely as the anti-S2 pAb may have preference for binding the S2-domain
over full Spike, we measured the FLAG-epitope at the C-terminus of Spike-mutant using an antiFLAG mAb (monoclonal antibody). This may provide more uniform recognition of both the full
Spike and the S2-subunit (Figure 4F). This blot suggests that N-glycan loss may trigger precipitous
(95 %, based on densitometry) loss of intact Spike protein due to enhanced cleavage at the S1-S2
interface. Consistent with the viral entry assay, we also noted greater proteolysis of virus produced
in [O]‾293Ts (52 %) compared to that produced in wild-type 293Ts (32 %). Together, the data
suggest that both Spike N-glycans, and possibly also O-glycans, may play a role in regulating
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein stability.

Small molecule inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation drastically reduced viral entry
Remarkably, the same observations as seen in the viral N-glycan knockouts could be
reproduced upon producing viral particles in cells cultured with the potent mannosidase-I alkaloid
inhibitor kifunensine (KI~25-125 nM, (25)) (Figure 5A). This water-soluble inhibitor reduced the
formation of complex N-glycans on cultured cells within 24-48 h with no change in cell viability
(Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). Virus produced in culture with 15 µM kifunensine displayed
~85-90 % reduction in infection, as measured using DsRed-reporter in microscopy (Figure 5B,
Figure 5-figure supplement 1B) and cytometry assays (Figure 5C, 5D). The reduction in Spike
molecular mass upon addition of this small molecule was less apparent compared to that in
[N]‾293Ts (Figure 5E), since blockade of Mannosidase-I preferentially gives rise to Man7-9
glycans while the MGAT1/[N]‾293Ts knockouts produce Man-5. Here also, the Spike-protein

proteolysis was more extensive upon kifunensine addition though it was not complete, as observed
in the anti-FLAG blot.
In order to determine if the enhanced S1-S2 site proteolysis of Spike protein upon N-glycan
inhibition is the exclusive reason for reduced viral entry, we produced virus with a Spike variant
(‘Spike-delta’) that contained the C-terminal FLAG epitope but that lacked the furin-site (Figure
5F). The substitution of the ‘RRAR’ sequence with a single Alanine (‘A’) resulted in viral Spike
that was not extensively cleaved both in the absence and presence of kifunensine. Robust viral
entry into 293T/ACE2 cells was observed using this furin resistant virus, and this too could be
partially blocked by kifunensine. Thus, in addition to proteolysis at the S1-S2 site, N-glycans may
have additional roles during viral entry.

DISCUSSION
This manuscript undertook a series of studies in order to comprehensively describe the role
of O- and N-linked glycans on SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding to human ACE2 (Figure 6A), and
related viral entry (Figure 6B). It demonstrates only a minor role for carbohydrates in regulating
Spike-ACE2 direct binding. In this regard, we observed some enhancement in Spike binding and
viral entry upon treating 293T/ACE2 with a pan-sialidase. Based on the published crystal structure
and molecular modeling, the critical glycans regulating this process are likely located at Asn-90
or Asn-322, proximal to the Spike binding interface ((7), Figure 1). The effect was nevertheless
small compared to that reported for other sialic acid dependent viruses like influenza (26), reovirus,
parovirus (27) and coronavirus like the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome virus/MERS (28).
The studies performed with CRISPR-Cas9 cell lines containing disrupted O- and N-linked
glycans also support the concept that glycosylation is not a critical regulator of ACE2-Spike
binding. Here, blocking O- and N-glycan biosynthesis on ACE2 did not impact either viral entry
or Spike-Fc binding. Thus, the functional change observed upon enzymatically removing sialic
acid on ACE2 is likely a steric effect, as it can be offset by other modifications. Blocking
elaboration of O- and N-glycans on Spike, also, only had a partial effect on ACE2-Fc binding.
This observation is consistent with previous cryo-EM (14, 15) and molecular dynamics simulation
results (29), which show that the active/“up” form of Spike RBD is largely exposed with few
glycans at the binding interface. It is now well appreciated that this lack of glycan shielding, makes
the exposed RBD a prime target for vaccine development.
In contrast to the modest effect of glycosylation on receptor-ligand binding, we observed
a much more profound role for glycans in regulating viral entry in part due to their impact on Spike
proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface. In this regard, we observed that blocking N-glycan elaboration

using both genetic approaches (i.e. MGAT1-KO/[N]‾293T) and the natural product mannosidaseI inhibitor, kifunensine, dramatically reduced viral entry into 293T/ACE2 cells. This was observed
for two virus types: Spike-WT and Spike-mut. In the case of Spike-mut, enzymatic and small
molecule inhibition resulted in enhanced proteolysis of Spike-protein during pseudovirus
production. These data suggest an inverse relation between furin cleavage and viral entry into
293T/ACE2 cells. Consistent with this, Spike-mut displayed reduced S1-S2 proteolysis compared
to Spike-WT, and higher viral infectivity. Others have also noted a reduction in viral entry, upon
increasing furin cleavage potential by addition of more basic residues (‘RRRKR’ mutation) at the
S1-S2 interface (11). Finally, a recent study observed that the introduction of the D614G mutation
in Spike reduced furin cleavage, and this resulted in enhanced viral infectivity (30). SARS-CoV2 containing the D614G mutation is currently the dominant strain worldwide (>80% prevalence,
(31)), and the possibility that this is due to altered furin cleavage potential is hotly debated. Overall,
our studies with MGAT1-KO, C1GalT1-KO and kifunensine suggest that both N- and O-glycans
may modulate the rates of proteolysis at the S1-S2 interface, thus affecting viral entry (Figure 6C).
While some S1 may be associated with Spike even after partial cleavage at the S1-S2 interface
(10), this may potentiate a quantitative reduction in RBD presentation on viral surface, resulting
in reduced ACE2 binding and lower viral entry. Indeed several N-glycans are located proximal to
the furin site: N603 and N657, and also N61 (18). O-glycans have also been hypothesized to exist in
this region at S673, T678 and S686 (32), and some of these have been experimentally verified (33).
How this site-specific glycosylation affects SARS-CoV-2 entry, remains to be determined.
In addition to its role in regulating RBD presentation, our data suggest that N-glycans may
also have other roles in regulating viral entry. In this regard, we noted that even the robust entry
of Spike-delta pseudovirus into 293T/ACE2 cells could be partially inhibited by kifunensine

(Figure 6C), and this is independent of S1-S2 proteolysis. Others have noted that the effect of
‘Spike-delta’ mutation may be cell type specific in that this mutation results in lower infectivity in
some cell types like Calu-3 which rely on the enzyme TMPRSS2 for viral fusion, while this
mutation does not affect entry into other cell types like VeroE6 which lacks TMPRSS2 (11). Based
on these observations, we speculate that additional glycosylation sites proximal to S2’ may also
modulate viral entry, perhaps because some proteases like TMPRSS2 have both ligand-binding
and protease activity. The N-glycans proximal to S2’ include N801, and to a lesser extent N616 and
N657. Additional studies with more cell types and mutant virus are necessary in order to fully
elucidate the molecular mechanism by which O- and N-glycans regulate host-cell specific viral
entry response.
In addition to basic science understanding, our findings have translational potential as it
suggests that both O- and N-glycan truncation may be used to reduce viral entry. In this regard, it
would be attractive to test additional N-glycosylation inhibitors, like Swainsonine, which has a
demonstrated safety profile in humans (34). Additional potential inhibitors that may modulate viral
entry include α-mannosidase inhibitors (deoxymannojirimycin, mannostatin A), α-glucosidase
inhibitors (N-butyl deoxynojirimycin, N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine, celgosivir)
(35), and finally compounds like SNAP (36, 37) and 4F-GalNAc (38) which block various aspects
of N- and O-glycan biosynthesis. These potentially represent off-the-shelf drugs and compounds
that may be repurposed to reduce viral load and ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory
symptoms. Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to test these concepts, and extend the
assay to authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains. Overall, while SARS-CoV-2 has developed a natural
ability to enhance infectivity, we propose that glycoengineering may provide a strategy to take
advantage of these evolutionary features to regulate viral entry and reduce disease transmission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials: Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (‘293T’) and Lenti-X 293T cells were purchased
from Clontech/Takara Bio (Mountain View, CA). Stable HEK293T/ACE2 cells were kindly
provided by Michael Farzan (Scripps Research, Jupiter, FL). All cells were mycoplasma negative.
These cell types were maintained in culture using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
containing 10 % fetal bovine serum, 1 % Pen-Strep and 1 % GlutaMAX supplement. All lectins
were from Vector labs. These include VVA (Vicia Villosa lectin, binds GalNAcα on O-glycans),
SNA (Sambucus nigra lectin, binds primarily α2,6 sialic acid), ECL (Erythrina cristagalli lectin,
binds desialylated lactosamine Galβ1,4GlcNAc chains) and PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris
Leucoagglutinin, binds Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,6(GlcNAcβ1,2Manα1,3)Manα1,3 on complex Nglycans). Goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal antibody (AF933) and mouse anti-human ACE2 mAb
MAB9332 were available from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MA). Rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2
RBD (40592-T62) and anti-S2 (40590-T62) pAbs were from Sino Biologicals (Beijing, China).
Anti-FLAG clone L5 was from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). All secondary antibodies (Abs) were
from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). When necessary, lectins and Abs were labelled
by addition of 25-fold molar excess succinimidyl ester coupled Alexa-405, Alexa-488, Alexa-555
or Alexa-647 dye (Fluoroprobes, Scottsdale, AZ) to protein suspended in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Following this, the reaction was quenched
with 1/10th volume 1 M Tris, and unreacted Alexa-dye was removed using 7 kDa molecular mass
cutoff Zeba desalting spin columns (Thermo). Unless mentioned otherwise, all other reagents were
from either Thermo-Fisher or Sigma Chemicals.

Molecular dynamics simulations: The ACE2-RBD complex structure (6LZG, (40)) was
superimposed to the trimeric spike protein state (6VYB (14)), in which one of the RBD domains
is “open” so that ACE2 is associated with the RBD domain in the open conformation. Missing
residues in the structure were modeled using PyRosetta (41). N-glycans were then added to the
structure using Glycan Reader within CHARMM-GUI (42, 43). The identity of the glycans was
assigned based on a published work (18). The final structure contained glycan modifications at 54
spike Asn and 6 ACE2 Asn.
All simulations were performed using NAMD2 (44) using the CHARMM36 parameters
(45). The complex was first placed in a water box of sufficient size to ensure a minimum 12 Å
separation from the wall. Net charge in the molecule was neutralized by adding 841 K+ and 743
Cl- ions, resulting in 867,166 atoms total. Protein and glycan atoms were first fixed while water
(TIP3) molecules were energy minimized for 10,000 steps. Next, the entire system was relaxed for
another 10,000 steps, and the system temperature was gradually increased to 310 K in increments
of 1 K with 120 fs of equilibration at each temperature. A time step of 2 fs was used. Constant
temperature and pressure were maintained using the Langevin framework (46). Long range
electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method (47). The simulation
was continued for 26.5 ns. Intermediate structures were saved every 10 ps.

Molecular biology: A plasmid containing the Spike protein (2019-nCov_pcDNA3.1(+)-P2AeGFP [v1]) was kindly provided by Dr. Haisheng Yu (Institute of Laboratory Animal Science,
Peking Union Medical College). To create plasmids [v3] and [v4], the full S1 domain coding
region (M1 to R682) or RBD coding region (R319 to F541) was PCR amplified and cloned into
the NheI/XbaI or AgeI/XbaI sites, respectively of pCSCG-19FcHisP2AdTom (48). Human ACE2

plasmid was obtained from Addgene (#1786, (6)). The entire ACE2 coding region was amplified
in two segments to silence an EcoRI cutting site in the coding region and joined by overlap
extension PCR. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/NheI site of pKLV2CMVpuroBFP vector to obtain [v2]. Additionally, [v5] was created by PCR amplifying the region
encoding ACE2 extracellular domain (Q18 to S740) and cloning into the AgeI/XbaI sites of
pCSCG-19FcHisP2AdTom plasmid. Plasmids [v2]-[v5] will be distributed via Addgene.

CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout cell lines: HEK293T CRISPR-Cas9 cells were generated by
transfecting wild-type 293T cells with pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 vector
(Addgene, Plasmid# 42230) carrying single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting either the Core-1
β3Gal-T (C1GalT1, target site: GCAGATTCTAGCCAACATAA) or β1,2 GlcNAc-transferase
(MGAT1, GTGGGGCGCTATCCTCTTTGTGG). While knocking out the former gene results
in cells expressing O-glycans truncated at the Tn-antigen stage (GalNAcα+sialic acid), the
latter prevents the N-glycan processing beyond the oligomannose/Man5 stage (23). Isogenic
clones of both cell lines were obtained by single-cell flow cytometry sorting using fluorescently
conjugated VVA and PHA-L for selection. Knockouts were confirmed by Sanger sequencing
of genomic DNA. For convenience, cells with disrupted O- and N-glycoprotein processing are
termed ‘[O]‾293T’ and ‘[N]‾293T’, respectively.

Recombinant protein expression and purification: All Fc-his tag proteins (vectors [v3], [v4]
and [v5]) were expressed by transient transfection of HEK 293T cells using the calcium phosphate
method (39), in 3-4 150 mm cell culture Petri dishes per protein. Protein secreted into serum-free
media were passed through a 1 mL HisTrap FF column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) at 1 mL/min.

Following extensive washing with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and
10 mM imidazole (pH7.2), the bound protein was eluted by collecting 0.5 mL fractions upon step
increasing imidazole concentration in the above buffer to 100 mM (8 mL) followed by 500 mM
(8 mL).
Protein concentration in each fraction was determined using a flow cytometry bead assay.
To this end, briefly, 5 µm Polybead carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA)
were

with

using

1-Ethyl-3-(3-

dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/EDC chemistry (49). 1μL of each fraction collected during
HisTRAP elution was incubated with these beads for 10 min at RT, before washing and addition
of 1:200 diluted FITC conjugated secondary Ab for an additional 10 min. Bead-bound Fc protein
was then quantified using flow cytometry. All fractions containing the Fc-fusion proteins were
then pooled and spin concentrated to ~150 μL volume. Buffer was exchanged to HEPES buffer
(30 mM HEPES, 110 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl2) using 7 kDa Zeba
desalting columns. Final protein concentration was determined in ELISA format by using a
calibrant Fc-protein of known concentration that was verified to be >95% pure based on silver
stain analysis. Here, a common anti-human HRP conjugated Ab was used to quantify both the Fc
proteins described in this manuscript and the calibrant Fc in the same assay.
Identity of expressed protein and also viral Spike was determined using western blotting
with anti-Fc (Jackson), anti-RBD (Sino Biologicals), anti-S2 (Sino Biologicals) and anti-ACE2
(R&D Systems) pAbs. Anti-FLAG mAb L5 was also used for western blotting of Spike-mutant
virus as it carried a C-terminal FLAG tag.

Flow cytometry: Standard flow cytometry methods were applied in some instances to measure
cell-surface protein expression and lectin binding, using directly conjugated fluorescent reagents
(23). Here the lectins/Abs were added to cells for 15 min, prior to performing a quick wash
followed by cytometry analysis. These data are presented as Geometric Mean Fluorescence
Intensity (‘GMFI’).

Spike protein-ACE2 binding studies: Full length Spike-protein and human ACE2 were
expressed in 293T cells (wild-type, [O]‾293T and [N]‾293T) by transient transfection using the
calcium phosphate method (39). These cells are called ‘293T/S’ or ‘293T/ACE2’ when expressed
on wild-type HEK293T cells, and ‘[O]‾293T/S’, ‘[O]‾293T/ACE2’, ‘[N]‾293T/S’ or
‘[N]‾293T/ACE2’ when expressed in the glycosylation-KO mutants. Here, just prior to functional
studies, cells were released from the culture substrate 48-72 h after transfection using PBS
containing 5 mM EDTA, washed and re-suspended in HEPES buffer containing 1.5 mM CaCl2.
During the binding studies, 0-4 μg/mL S1-Fc, RBD-Fc or ACE2-Fc were added to 20×106 cells/mL
at 4 ⁰C for 15 min. Following this, 1:200 diluted Alexa-647 (Ax647) conjugated goat anti-humanFc (Fab')2 Ab was added for an additional 10 min. The cells were then washed, resuspended and
read immediately using a 4-laser BD Fortessa flow cytometer. Transfected cells were gated based
on EGFP expression for Fc-protein binding studies performed with 293T/S-protein cells, and BFP
expression for studies using 293T/ACE2 cells. Cell surface expression of ACE2 and Spike on
transiently transfected cells was also monitored on experimental day using flow cytometry. These
studies used Alexa-647 conjugated anti-ACE2 (MAB9332, R&D systems) and anti-RBD (Sino
Biologicals) antibodies. In some cases, binding studies were also performed with stable
293T/ACE2 cells, in which case fluorescence gating was not necessary.

In some assays, cells were treated with sialidase (200 U/mL Arthrobacter ureafaciens α23,6,8,9-Neuraminidase, New England BioLabs) for 1 h at 37 ⁰C, and washed using HEPES buffer
prior to the binding assay. Sialidase activity was verified based on SNA and ECL staining. In this
case, control cells were treated identically, except that sialidase was withheld. SNA was directly
conjugated with Alexa-555 and ECL was conjugated with Alexa-647 in order to simplify the
implementation of dual color cytometry measurements.

Pseudovirus production and characterization: SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein virus was generated
by replacing the classical Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) envelope protein of 3rd generation
lentivirus with either wild-type Spike protein (‘Spike-WT’, [v1]) or a mutant Spike plasmid
(‘Spike-mutant’) containing an ‘SRAS’ sequence in place of furin sensitive ‘RRAR’ (gift from
Michael Farzan, (22)). In an additional variant called ‘Spike-delta’, the ‘SRAS’ site in Spikemutant was replaced by a single ‘A’. To produce these viruses, Lenti-X 293T cells (Takara Bio,
MountainView, CA) were transiently transfected with 17.8 µg of pLKO.1 TRC-DsRed, 22 µg of
psPAX2 and 5.8 µg of VSVG (or 9.9 µg of v1 or 8.6 µg of Spike-mutant/Spike-delta) plasmid in
a 15 cm dish using the calcium phosphate method (39). Six hours post-transfection, the medium
was changed to virus collection medium (OPTIMEM + 10% FBS). The first batch of virus was
collected 18-20 h thereafter. Virus collection medium was then supplemented with 10 mM sodium
butyrate. The second virus batch was collected 18-20 h later. Both virus batches were pooled,
filtered through 0.45 m filter and ultra-centrifuged at 50,000×g to concentrate the particles. The
viral pellet was resuspended in OPTIMEM + 10 % FBS, aliquoted and stored at -80 ⁰C until use.
Following the above protocol, 14 additional virus types were generated in this manuscript.
This includes virus with envelope composed of: i. VSVG, ii. Spike-WT or iii. Spike-mutant that

were produced in either: a. wild-type HEK293T, b. [O]‾293T c. [N]‾293T or d. wild-type
HEK293T being cultured in the presence of 15 µM kifunensine (Toronto Research Chemicals,
Canada). In addition, Spike-delta was produced in the presence and absence of 15 µM
kifunensine. For many of the production lots, viral titer was determined using the lentiviral p24
ELISA kit from Takara Bio (MountainView, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Virus
concentration was also verified by western blotting with anti-S2 pAb or anti-FLAG to detect
equivalent amounts of Spike protein in each of the preparations.

Pseudovirus entry assay: In order to transduce cells, virus was added at various titers indicated
in the main manuscript to either wild-type 293Ts, stable 293T/ACE2 cell lines or various
glycoengineered variants that transiently overexpressed ACE2 (at 48h post-transfection). Such
infection was performed in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene as described previously (39). In
some cases, either the virus or cells were treated with sialidase for 1 h at 37 ⁰C under conditions
described above, prior to transduction. Virus was removed and fresh medium was added 8 h posttransduction. DsRed fluorescence was monitored on a daily basis. All flow cytometry and
microscopy data presented in this manuscript correspond to the 72 h time point. Here, DsRed
positive cells and the arithmetic mean fluorescence intensity (‘MFI’) of all cells in the PE-channel
were also quantified using flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20). Microscopy images were acquired
using a Zeiss AxioObserver instrument (10X/0.25 NA or 20X/0.4 NA objective).

Statistics: All data are presented as mean + standard deviation. Dual comparisons were performed
using the two-tailed Student’s t-test. ANOVA followed by the Tukey post-test was used for

Figure 1. Glycan coverage of Spike-ACE2 co-complex: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer
(pink) bound to ACE2 (green). A. without glycans. B. with N-glycans (red) identified using LCMS on Spike and ACE2. C. Molecular dynamics simulation analyzed the range of movement of
each glycan. The space sampled by glycans is represented by a gray cloud. Glycans cover the
Spike-ACE2 interface. They also surround the putative proteolysis site of furin (“S1-S2”, yellow)
and S2’ (blue).
Figure 2. Sialic acid has modest effect on Spike binding and viral entry. A. Full-length proteins
expressed on cells include wild-type Spike-protein [v1] and human ACE2 [v2]. N-glycosylation
sites are indicated by lollipop. Fc-his soluble proteins encode for S1-subunit [v3], RBD [v4] and
soluble ACE2 [v5]. All constructs were co-expressed with fluorescent reporters separated by P2A.
Note that the Fc-section also contains one N-glycosylation site. B. Western blot for purified Fcproteins from HEK293T probed with anti-Fc, anti-RBD or anti-ACE2 Ab. CD44-Fc is positive
control. C. Flow cytometry data showing S1-Fc (1.7µg/mL) and RBD-Fc (0.35µg/mL) binding to
ACE2 expressed on HEK293T (middle panel). Spike expression enhances ACE2-Fc (1.4µg/mL)
binding (bottom). D. Desialylation of Spike-protein expressed on 293T/S had minimal effect on
ACE2-Fc (0.7µg/mL) binding. ACE2 desialylation on 293T/ACE2 increased binding of RBD-Fc
(0.2µg/mL) and S1-Fc (1.7µg/mL) by 26-56% (paired experiments, *P<0.05). E. Pseudovirus with
DsRed reporter were developed with three different envelope proteins. VSVG pseudotyped virus
infected both HEK293T (black line) and stable 293T/ACE2 (red line) cells. Virus with Spike-WT
and Spike-mutant entered 293T/ACE2 only. F. Same titer of virus (0.3µg/mL p24-equivalent) were
treated with or without sialidase, prior to addition to stable 293T/ACE2 cells. Infection using
Spike-mutant was higher compared to Spike-WT. Sialidase treatment of virus had no effect. G.
293T/ACE2 cells were sialidase treated prior to addition of VSVG (0.3µg/mL p24-equiv.), SpikeWT (1.5µg/mL p24-equiv.) or Spike-mutant (0.2µg/mL p24-equiv.) pseudovirus. Sialidase

Figure 3. ACE2 glycosylation does not affect viral entry. A. Knocking out C1GALT1 and
MGAT1 using CRISPR-Cas9 inhibits O- and N-glycan biosynthesis in HEK293Ts. B. Sanger
sequencing results of isogenic 293T clones shows indels on all 3 alleles of C1GALT1 (‘[O]¯293T’)
and single allele of MGAT1 (‘[N]¯293T’) knockout cells. Wild-type (WT) sequence is on the first
line. Lower line shows base deletions (hyphen) and insertions (black fonts) for individual KOs.
sgRNA target sequence is in red and protospacer adjacent motif is underlined. C. Increased VVA
and reduced PHA-L binding confirm loss of O-linked glycans in [O]¯293Ts and N-glycans in
[N]¯293Ts, respectively. D. Knocking out N-glycans on Spike protein reduced ACE2-Fc binding
in cytometry based binding studies. Knocking out Spike O-glycans increased ACE-2 binding. EF. Truncation of ACE2 N- and O-glycans did not affect either S1-Fc (panel E) or RBD-Fc (panel
F) binding. G. ACE2 was transiently expressed on 293T, [O]¯293T and [N]¯293T cells. All
pseudotyped virus efficiently entered ACE2 expressing cells. Virus was not titered for these runs,
and thus comparison between viruses is not possible. * P<0.05 with respect to all other treatments.

Figure 4. N-glycan modification of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus abolishes entry into
293T/ACE2 cells. A. Pseudovirus expressing VSVG envelope protein, Spike-WT and Spikemutant were produced in wild-type, [O]¯ and [N]¯293T cells. All 9 viruses were applied at equal
titer to stable 293T/ACE2. B-C. O-glycan truncation of Spike partially reduced viral entry. Nglycan truncation abolished viral entry. In order to combine data from multiple viral preparations
and independent runs in a single plot, all data were normalized by setting DsRed signal produced
by virus generated in wild-type 293T to 10,000 normalized MFI or 100% normalized DsRed
positive value. D. Viral titration study performed with Spike-mutant virus shows complete loss of
viral infection over a wide range. E. Western blot of Spike protein using anti-S2 Ab shows reduced
proteolysis of Spike-mut compared to Spike-WT. The full Spike protein and free S2-subunit
resulting from S1-S2 cleavage is indicated. Molecular mass is reduced in [N]¯293T products due
to truncation of glycan biosynthesis. F. Anti-FLAG Ab binds the C-terminus of Spike-mutant.

Spike produced in [N]¯293Ts is almost fully proteolyzed during viral production (red arrowhead).
*P<0.05 with respect to all other treatments.

Fig 5. Mannosidase-I blockade using kifunensine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry
into 293T/ACE2 cells. A. VSVG, Spike-WT and Spike-mutant pseudovirus were produced in the
presence of 15µM kifunensine or vehicle control. The 6 viruses were added to 293T/ACE2 at equal
titer. B-D. Microscopy (panel B) and cytometry (panel C, D) show ~90% loss of viral infection in
the case of Spike-WT and Spike-mutant virus upon kifunensine treatment (*P<0.05). E. Spike
molecular mass is reduced in the western blots due to high mannose glycan synthesis in runs with
kifunensine. Intact Spike is reduced in the presence of kifunensine, in anti-FLAG blot. F. The
polybasic furin ‘RRAR’ site was substituted by a single ‘A’ amino acid in Spike-delta. Virus with
Spike-delta were expressed both in the presence of vehicle and kifunensine. Western blot shows
lack of S1-S2 cleavage in this construct. In viral entry assay, kifunensine reduced DsRed
expression in 293T/ACE2 cells, even in the case of Spike-delta pseudovirus (*P<0.05). Similar
observation was made at two different viral titers (0.3 and 0.6μg/mL p24 equivalent).
Fig 6. Principal findings and conceptual model: A. ACE2-Fc binding was measured to wildtype or glycoEnzyme-KO 293T cells expressing Spike. Sialidase treatment of cells was performed
in some cases. Similar studies also measured S1-Fc and RBD-Fc binding to cell-surface expressed
ACE2. B. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (bearing Spike-WT, Spike-mut, Spike-delta variants) were
generated in wild-type or glycoEnzyme-KO 293Ts, in the presence and absence of kifunensine.
Main results of binding (A) and viral-entry (B) assay are listed. C. Conceptual model shows that
kifunensine can induce S1-S2 site proteolysis on Spike-WT and Spike-mut virus, but not Spikedelta virus. This proteolysis reduces RBD presentation and attenuates viral entry into 293T/ACE2.
Without affecting S1-S2 cleavage, kifunensine also partially reduced Spike-delta pseudovirus
entry function. The data suggest additional roles for Spike N-glycans during viral entry.
