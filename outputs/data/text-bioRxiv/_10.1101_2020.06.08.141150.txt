The coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, uses −1 programmed
ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the relative expression of viral proteins. As
modulating −1 PRF can inhibit viral replication, the RNA pseudoknot stimulating −1 PRF
may be a fruitful target for therapeutics treating COVID-19. We modeled the unusual 3stem structure of the stimulatory pseudoknot of SARS-CoV-2 computationally, using
multiple blind structural prediction tools followed by μs-long molecular dynamics
simulations. The results were compared for consistency with nuclease-protection assays
and single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements of the SARS-CoV-1 pseudoknot, to
determine the most likely conformations. We found several possible conformations for the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, all having an extended stem 3 but with different packing of
stems 1 and 2. Several conformations featured rarely-seen threading of a single strand
through the junction formed between two helices. These structural models may help
interpret future experiments and support efforts to discover ligands inhibiting −1 PRF in
SARS-CoV-2.
INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across the globe since the virus emerged in late 2019
(1). Given the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the novel immunological challenge it poses
to human hosts, epidemiological modeling suggests that recurring outbreaks with elevated
mortality can be expected even despite successful public-health responses, until vaccines or
preventive drugs can be found to inhibit transmission (2). The discovery of effective treatment
therapeutics is thus one of the central goals of research into COVID-19 (3).
One potential target for treatment is the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot found between
the overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (4). Like other human
coronaviruses (5), SARS-CoV-2 depends on −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF)
to produce essential proteins at regulated levels (6). In −1 PRF, a shift in reading frame is
stimulated at a specific location in the RNA message by a structure in the mRNA—typically a
pseudoknot—located 5–7 nt downstream of a ‘slippery’ sequence, thereby generating more than
1 protein from the same message (7, 8). The ratio of frameshifted gene products must often be
held within a tight range for optimal propagation of the virus, hence disrupting −1 PRF by
modulating the efficiency of frameshifting can attenuate the virus. Indeed, inhibiting −1 PRF was
found to suppress replication of the close relative SARS-CoV-1 by orders of magnitude (9, 10),
suggesting that the same strategy may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

The structure of the frameshift-stimulatory
pseudoknot has not yet been solved for either SARSCoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, however, hindering structurebased drug-discovery efforts. The primary sequences of
these two pseudoknots are almost identical, differing by a
single nucleotide, hence their secondary structure is
expected to be the same. Evidence from computational
methods, nuclease protection assays, and 2D NMR
spectroscopy applied to the SARS-CoV-1 pseudoknot
(11, 12) indicates it has an unusual 3-stem architecture:
whereas pseudoknots typically consist of 2 interleaved
stems and loops, here the second loop is greatly extended
and a third stem-loop combination forms within it (Fig.
1). Bulged adenine residues in stem 2 (S2) and stem 3
(S3) seem to play important functional roles, as mutating
them to cytosine abolished or reduced −1 PRF
(respectively for the bulges in S2 and S3) (12). However,
the full 3D structure has never been solved for any 3-stem
pseudoknot.

The sequence is color-coded by

only difference from SARS-CoV-1 is
that A59 (red) is changed to C59 in
the latter. Bases shown in italic are
protected against nuclease digestion
in SARS-CoV-1.

Computational modeling provides an alternative
approach to characterizing the structure of these
pseudoknots, but such modeling has been limited to date.
One study assembled a 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-1
pseudoknot by hand with the Sybyl chemical modeling
package before equilibrating briefly with 1 ns of
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (13), and another study used the Rosetta FARFAR2
platform (14, 15) to make a ‘blind’ prediction of the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot
(16). Here, we have modeled the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot more extensively,
using blind predictions from multiple platforms as inputs for μs-long MD simulations to examine
the stability of the structures. We also assessed the ensemble of structures observed in the
simulations for their consistency with previous work on the biochemical and biophysical
properties of the SARS-CoV-1 pseudoknot to identify the most likely structural models. We
found several possibilities, all sharing an extended S3 helix but differing in the S1/S2 packing
and junction with S3.
METHODS
Blind structure prediction: Initial structures for input into MD simulations were obtained using
multiple platforms for blind RNA structure prediction: SimRNA (17), Rosetta FARFAR2 (14,
15), RNAComposer (18), RNAvista (19), RNA2D3D (20), and Vfold (21). For the blind
predictions, we assumed the secondary structure shown in Fig. 1, based on previous
characterization of the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-1 pseudoknot (12).
MD simulations: Models from blind structure predictions were used as starting structures for
all-atom MD simulations in explicit solvent. The models were protonated at pH 7 using
Molecular Operating Environment software. The pseudoknots were parameterized using the
f99bsc0_chiOL3 force-field and were solvated in optimal point charge water boxes of 12 Å using

the tleap module of Amber18 (22). The solvated systems were first neutralized using sodium
ions, then their salinities were adjusted to 0.15 M NaCl. Each model was simulated under two
conditions: without Mg2+ ions, or with six Mg2+ ions placed initially at the junction between S1
and S3 as well as along the backbone of S2. The solvated systems were energy-minimized then
heated to 310K with heavy restraints of 10 kcal/mol/A2 on the backbone phosphate atoms. These
restraints were gradually removed and the unrestrained systems were then simulated for 1 μs at
constant pressure.
Analysis of simulated models: Analysis was performed using CPPTRAJ of AmberTools.
Different conformations of the pseudoknot within each simulation were clustered based on the
root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of residues G1–G40 and C49–G66 (omitting the residues
in L2 and at the 3′ terminus, which tended to have large fluctuations), using the hierarchical
agglomerative approach. The representative structures of the three most populated clusters of
each model were visually assessed for helical distortions in S1, S2 and S3. The hydrogen
bonding of the residues identified as protected in SARS-CoV-1 by nuclease-protection assays
(12) as well as of bulged adenines and residues in L1 were also calculated, reporting the
interactions formed by hydrogen bond donors and acceptors between two bases or between a
base and the backbone atoms of other residues that were present for at least the last 100 ns of the
trajectory. The root-mean-squared fluctuation (RMSF) of each residue was also calculated.
RESULTS
We made initial estimates of the pseudoknot structure using a variety of tools that have been
developed for blind prediction of RNA structure (14, 15, 17–21), where the only input was the
sequence and the expected secondary structure, as shown in Fig. 1. Some of these predictions
were rejected as being implausible (e.g. containing topological knots, which cannot occur) or
being obviously inconsistent with the nuclease protection data. The remainder are illustrated in
Fig. 2; note that those in Fig. 2F–H were also reported previously in a separate study (16). These
predictions were quite varied. They all showed S3 as an extended helix lacking obvious contacts
with the rest of pseudoknot except right near the junction with S1. However, the arrangement of
S1 and S2 and L1 and L3 differed significantly between the predictions. In several models (Fig.
2A–D), S1 and S2 were packed very tightly, leading to distorted or broken base-pairs in order to
accommodate the packing. A couple of models (Fig. 2E, G) showed an unusual quasi-knotted
structure where the 5′ end was threaded through the junction between S1 and S3, a fold topology
that has only been seen previously in exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (23). Another model (Fig.
2H) showed a similar fold topology, but this time with L3 (near the 3′ end) threaded through the
junction between S1 and S2. Note that in several cases, the first three nucleotides upstream of the

5′ end of the pseudoknot (UUU) were included in the modeling, in order to distinguish the
possibilities for 5′-end threading.
To examine if the blind predictions were dynamically stable, we used them to initiate
extended all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Each structure in Fig. 2 was simulated for at
least 1 μs in explicit solvent under two conditions: with NaCl only, or with both NaCl and Mg2+
ions. Both conditions were used because not all pseudoknots require Mg2+ ions to fold (24, 25),
and it is unclear if Mg2+ ions are essential for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot. The first part of the
simulation was treated as an equilibration
phase and only the last 500 ns of the simulation
was examined in each case. Because the
simulations were dynamic, we clustered the
structures occupied in the simulations by
RMSD and examined the centroid
(representative) structures of the three most
occupied clusters.
The initial models that involved the tightest
packing of S1 and S2 (Fig. 2A–D) led, after
equilibration in MD simulations, to structures
that featured various combinations of
significant defects in the expected base-pairing
for S1, defects in S2, and/or a lack of tertiary
contacts (Fig. S1). In some cases, these
structures were sufficiently unstable that they
unfolded substantially. This set of models was
therefore rejected as very unlikely to be
correct. The other initial models yielded
structures under at least one of the MD
simulation conditions that were more plausible,
and they were thus analyzed in more detail.
The results could be arranged into three
groups: structures without any threading at
either end (Fig. 3), structures with the 5′ end
threaded through the S1/S3 junction (Fig. 4),

Considering first the structures that were
more similar to standard H-type pseudoknots,
without any threading of either end through

the most populated clusters with and without
Mg2+ are shown in Fig. 3. With Mg2+ (Fig. 3A–

were identified in S2/L1 (Fig. 3A, triangles),
and U60 in L3 was seen to bond with both G10
and U22 in S1. Base-pairs in S1 (G6:C25) and

S3 (G31:U58) were disrupted, in favor of base-backbone bonding (Fig. 3A, dotted lines) between
C25 and both G57 and U58, and a wobble pair with the end of the linker (G31:U0). A network of
base-base hydrogen-bond interactions (Fig. 3A, dashed lines) was also seen in L2. The
stabilization from the hydrogen bond networks led to low fluctuations, even in L2, and the RNA
spent almost of its time in the top 3 clusters (Fig S2A). For the simulations without Mg2+ (Fig.
3D–F), the disrupted base-pairs in S1 and S3 were restored, but the triples in S2/L1 were absent
and the pairing in the lower part of S2 was disrupted in favor of non-canonical interactions
between U11:C62 and G19:A63. However, the sparser hydrogen bond network led to higher
fluctuations and a greater diversity of clusters than with Mg2+ present (Fig. S2B).
Turning next to the representative structures of the most populated clusters with the 5′ end
threaded through the S1/S3 junction, we found several possibilities. With Mg2+ present (Fig. 4A–
C), again several triples/triple-like interactions were identified in S2/L1, two of them the same as
in Fig. 3A–C. The opening G:U pair in S1 was disrupted in favor of interactions with G57 and
U58, to accommodate the threading of the 5′ end through the S1/S3 junction, and S3 was
extended by a non-canonical pair between G40 and A48. L2 was again structured by a network
of hydrogen bonds, but L3 did not interact with any other part of the structure other than a
coordinated Mg2+ ion. Without Mg2+, two different structures were seen. In the first (Fig. 4D–F),
the 5′ end was threaded through the S1/S3 junction without disrupting the base-pairing near the
junction, stabilized by bonding between G31 and U0. Only one triple was seen in S2/L1, but it
was also bonded with the bulged A63 in S2. The U20:A61 pair at one end of S2 was distorted to
include interactions between U11 and A61, and U60 in L3 was bonded to both G10 and C21,
analogous to the situation in Fig. 3A–C. L2 was partially structured by interactions between G40
and U47. In the second structure without Mg2+ (Fig. 4G–I), the first two base-pairs in S3 next to
the S1/S3 junction were opened to facilitate the 5′-end threading, stabilized by bonding between
U0 and G31, with the unpaired G57 and U58 forming H-bonds with the backbone at A24 and

U23. Two of the same triples/triple-like interactions
were seen as in Figs. 3A–C and 4A–C, and once
again U60 in L3 interacted with G10 in S1 (although
this time via a base-backbone bond). The bottom of
S3 was also re-arranged, forming a triple with the
bulged A52 and extending the stem with the pair
G40:C49 and non-canonical bonding between C41
and A48. As above, the simulation with Mg2+
showed smaller fluctuations than those without
Mg2+; the fraction of the trajectory spent in the top 3
clusters was very high (over 90%) for the simulation
with Mg2+ and the first model without Mg2+, but
lower (66%) for the second model without Mg2+ (Fig
S3).

partially structured by base-backbone bonds between G40, A48, and the closing base-pair of S3.
The top three clusters comprised 78% of the MD trajectory, with relatively low fluctuations (Fig.
S4).
DISCUSSION
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this work is that we find three very different fold
topologies that are stable and persistent in long MD simulations. Such a result contrasts with
previous work simulating the pseudoknot from SARS-CoV-1, which reported only a single
structure that was somewhat similar to the models with 5′-end threading, although the additional
nucleotides completing the threading were not included in the model (13). This difference can be
explained by the fact that only a single initial structure was explored in that work: the three fold
topologies we observe are sufficiently different that they cannot interconvert without substantial
unfolding of the S1/S2 region, and they are each sufficiently stable that such unfolding is very
unlikely (as seen in our simulations). Furthermore, the existence of multiple structures has been
seen previously in various frameshift signals (26–28). Indeed, it is entirely consistent with the
hypothesis (29–31) that high-efficiency stimulatory structures such as that from SARS-CoV-2—
which induces −1 PRF at a rate of ~20–30% (6)—have high conformational heterogeneity and
hence forms more than one structure.

Each of the models presented above is generally consistent with previous experimental
characterizations of the SARS-CoV-1 pseudoknot. Single-molecule force spectroscopy of
pseudoknot unfolding for SARS-CoV-1 found a broad unfolding force distribution with high
forces, indicating the presence of significant tertiary contact formation (29). Consistent with this
observation, all of the models feature tertiary contacts and hydrogen-bond networks stabilizing
the 3D structure, although the unthreaded model without Mg2+ lacked the triples found in the
other models. Turning to the results from nuclease-protection and mutation experiments (12),
each model contained features that could be matched to protected residues, such as triples,
hydrogen-bond networks, or steric protection; the participation of A63 in S2 in triples was also
consistent with work showing that mutating A63 can dramatically lower the −1 PRF efficiency.
Again, the unthreaded model without Mg2+ was most lacking in these features, suggesting that it
is the model that is least consistent with the experimental data. We note, however, that none of
the structural models provided an obvious explanation for a few of the protected nucleotides,
such as G54 and U55.
It is still unknown if Mg2+ is essential for the folding of this pseudoknot. Our modelling,
however, suggests that Mg2+ helps to stabilize the structures. In every case, the fluctuations were
reduced with Mg2+ present, and in most cases the presence of Mg2+ stimulated a denser network
of hydrogen bonds. The role of Mg2+ was particularly important for threading L3 through the
S1/S2 junction (Fig 5): Mg2+ was found to be essential for maintaining the integrity of S1, as the
tight packing of the backbone that was needed could not be accommodated without the
countervailing charge from the ions.
The threaded fold topologies are particularly interesting: although they have been observed in
exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs, where the 5′ end is threaded through a ring closed by a
pseudoknot (23), no such fold has been seen in a frameshift-stimulatory structure. We note that
threading of either the 5′ end (as in Fig. 4) or L3 (as in Fig. 5) requires that the different parts of
the structure fold in a specific order. For example, S2 would likely need to form last for 5′-end
threading, else the RNA upstream of the pseudoknot would be unable to thread through the
S1/S3 junction, whereas S1 would likely need to form last for L3 threading, else the downstream
RNA would be unable to thread through the S1/S2 junction. As a result, the pseudoknot would
be expected to populate multiple conformers, dictated by the kinetic partitioning between the
different possible pathways (32).
The structural models described above will be helpful for future experimental analyses of the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot. X-ray scattering profiles can be predicted from these models and used
to analyze small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering measurements, to confirm which (if any) of
these conformations are populated and in what kind of mixture (33, 34). The models could also
be compared to single-molecule measurements of pseudoknot folding, which could detect
heterogeneous populations of different conformers and characterize the sequence of intermediate
states formed during the folding of each one (28, 35, 36). These models should also prove useful
for drug discovery efforts, facilitating structure-based searches for compounds that attenuate the
virus by altering −1 PRF.
