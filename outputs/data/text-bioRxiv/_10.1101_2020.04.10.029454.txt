Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the single-stranded RNA virus severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus of zoonotic origin that
was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. There is evidence that
homologous recombination contributed to this cross-species transmission. Since that
time the virus has demonstrated a high propensity for human-to-human transmission.
Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the
nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K/G204R) due to three adjacent
nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new
strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination
from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SASCoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported
sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these
polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLAC*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried
by >40% of the population. The findings suggest that homologous recombination may
have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for increased
viral fitness and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations.

Background
Evidence of viral adaptation to selective pressures as it spreads among diverse human
populations has implications for the ongoing potential for changes in viral fitness over
time, which in turn may impact transmissibility, disease pathogenesis and
immunogenicity.

epidemiological profiles of disease are likely to reflect the spread of founder viruses,
which first entered different SARS-CoV-2 naÃ¯ve populations. However, the extent to
which selection pressures operating within those populations also impact SARS-CoV2 diversity is currently not known. Functional effects of new genetic changes need to
be considered in ongoing public health measures to contain infection around the world
and in the development of universal vaccines and antiviral therapy. Here we describe
a new emerging strain of SARS-CoV-2 within the LGG clade that appears to be the
result of a homologous recombination event that introduced three adjacent nucleotide
changes spanning two residues of the nucleocapsid protein. That strain expanded
rapidly in Europe in March 2020. This protein forms an integral part of the virus lifecycle and is known to be highly immunogenic.

Main text
Newly emerging strain from Europe with linked variations in the nucleocapsid
We utilized publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the GISAID database
(www.gisaid.org; see Supplementary Material) to identify polymorphisms arising in
global circulating forms of the virus in relation to region and time of collection. Of the
2336 circulating strains examined in this study there was limited variation across the
genome with only 12 amino acid polymorphisms present in >5% of the deposited
sequences (Supplementary Table 1). Of these polymorphisms, three were the

polymorphisms L84S in ORF8, D614G in surface glycoprotein (S) and G251V in
NS3 (ORF3a) that mark the major worldwide clades S, G and V, respectively. Two
newly identified adjacent polymorphisms (R203K and G204R) in the nucleocapsid
protein occur in approximately 13.4% of deposited strains and form one of the main
strains emerging from Europe (Figure 1A). Other common polymorphisms include
Q57H in NS3, T85I in NSP2, L37F in NSP6, P323L in the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase, T175M in the membrane glycoprotein and P504L and Y541C in the
helicase. Current low frequency polymorphisms at <5% of deposited SARS-CoV-2
sequences include S193I in the nucleocapsid, H93Y in NS3, and the following
polymorphisms V378I, G392D, I739V, P765S, A876T, F3071Y, G3278S and
K3353R in ORF1ab (Supplementary Table 1).

The polymorphisms are present in strains sequenced using different next generation
sequencing (NGS) platforms (e.g. nanopore, Illumina) and the Sanger-based
sequencing method making it unlikely that the new changes are sequence or
alignment errors. In addition, different laboratories around the world have deposited
sequences with these polymorphisms in the database and examination of individual
sequences in the region does not find obvious insertions/deletions likely representing
alignment issues or homopolymer slippage.

Adjacent amino acid polymorphisms due to three adjacent nucleotide changes in
the nucleocapsid
For the two newly identified adjacent polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions
203 and 204, there were no strains in the database that had only one of the two
changes. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited into the GISAID database are

consensus strains predominantly generated from NGS platforms that can typically
identify low frequency variants. We did not have access to the original sequence files
from the contributing laboratories in order to assess if there was evidence of strains
that harbored only one of the polymorphisms at lower frequencies. However, no
circulating strain has so far been captured that contains only one of the two
nucleocapsid polymorphisms as the consensus sequence.

The rapid emergence of these closely linked polymorphisms in viruses may reflect
strong selection pressure on this region of the genome in which the original mutation
incurred a replicative capacity, or other fitness cost, which could be restored by a
linked compensatory mutation. Evidence for such adaptations with closely linked
compensatory mutations are known to occur under host immune pressure as is well
established for other adaptable RNA viruses such as HIV 1,2 and Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) 3. These viruses have such a high rate of viral replication and error-prone
reverse transciptase that a massive swarm of viral variants with ongoing
recombination between residues is generated continuously. As a result selection
pressure exerted by immune responses or other selective pressures effectively operate
on each separate residue independently 4. In contrast, coronaviruses encode proofreading machinery and have a propensity to adapt by homologous recombination
between viruses rather than classic step-wise individual mutations driven by selective
pressures operating on single viral residues. This, together with the routine nature of
their cross-species transmission 5, led Graham and Baric 6 to presciently warn in 2010
that it was a matter of when, rather than if, a pathogenic coronavirus pandemic would
occur in humans. Also of note, the phenomena of compensatory fixation has been
described in the area of HIV antiviral resistance in which the linked mutations cannot

revert to wild type when the selective pressure is removed as the virus cannot
negotiate the fitness valley to return to its previous optimal state 7. We therefore
predict that the K203/R204 (AAA CGA) change is likely to remain fixed and
intermediates to the wild type are unlikely to be found. It will be critical to determine
if the introduction of the AAACGA motif results in a replicative or other fitness cost
to the virus, creates an alternative subgenomic mRNA transcript or RNA secondary
structure or increases nucleocapsid activity as this could indicate that there may be
viral attenuation as passage occurs globally through populations of diverse
immunogenetic background.

As further evidence of the likelihood of a homologous recombination event, the
R203K polymorphism involves a two-step process from AGG to AAA. However,
strikingly, the position shows no evidence to date of alternative codon usage, all viral
strains that contain an R at this position have the AGG codon, and similarly those
strains with a K (lysine) at this position have the AAA. Circulating strains that contain
the intermediate codon as the consensus resulting from a single step to the AGG
lysine amino acid (i.e. the arginine codon AGA or the lysine codon AAG) appear
completely absent among captured strains to date.

To identify possible viral sources for homologous recombination with SARS-CoV-2,
we initially performed a search of the motif in the nucleocapsid in related beta
coronaviruses from human and other species in the public databases and only found
the presence of the R203/G204 combination. We performed a similar search in our
metatranscriptome data generated from a cohort study consisting of 65 subjects of
which 43 had acute respiratory infections and 22 were asymptomatic. From the data

we assembled near complete and coding complete viral genomes of the Coronavirus
(NL63 - alpha, OC43 - beta, 229E - alpha), RSV (A, B), Rhinovirus (A, B, C),
Influenza (A - H3N2), and Bocavirus family. None of the alpha coronaviruses had the
R203/G204 or K203/R204 combination or indeed any variation at these sites (n=14;
sequence depth >3000). We then performed a search for stretches of similarity using
varying window sizes (>14bp including the motif; 8) in all sequences. No significant
hits were identified. However, the AAACGA motif overlaps with the core sequence
(CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences 9 of SAR-CoV-2 itself and this motif
has been found several times within SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the protein for
ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein, envelope, ORF6, ORF7b and ORF8 (Supplementary
Figure 1).

New nucleocapsid polymorphisms likely emerged from existing strain containing
the clade defining L84 (ORF8), G614 (S) and G251 (NS3) amino acids
As many of the sequences have been generated using NGS technologies that likely
reflect single strains across the viral genome, we examined whether the new
polymorphisms occurred on specific existing viral genetic backgrounds. The
K203/R204 polymorphisms so far only exist on strains that carry the following clade
defining amino acids - L84 in ORF8, G614 in S and G251 in NS3 to form the
combination (haplotype) KR-LGG (Figure 1A). A chronological analysis of the
emergence of the different strains as defined by the five positions (and based on the
collection date assigned to the deposited sequences) shows the transition between
major forms (Figure 1B). The first sequences identified in China contained the RGLDG combination that closely clusters with the SARS-CoV-2 strain RG-SDG that
was first deposited in early January of Chinese origin and is present in both the bat

and pangolin coronaviruses and the previous SARS-CoV strain associated with the
2003 outbreak. These two strains of SARS-CoV-2 are now prevalent on most
continents (Figure 1A) and the RG-LDG strain was also the dominant strain that was
identified in passengers and crew abroad the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in
Japan immediately prior to the more global dissemination of cases worldwide. The
RG-LDG, RG-SDG and RG-LDV strains were circulating in Asia before midJanuary, with entry into the West coast of the US with the first identified case in
Washington State January 21, 2020 and by March the RG-SDG strain had become
widespread in North America.

The appearance of the RG-LGG and KR-LGG strains occurred in the database in late
February in Europe and for the RG-LGG strain in the US by early-mid March. To
date the viruses with the KR-LGG haplotype form a significant portion of circulating
strains in the Netherlands and Iceland with smaller numbers in neighboring European
countries and elsewhere. In the Netherlands the first confirmed case of Sars-CoV-2
infection was on February 28, 2020 in an individual who had recently visited the
Lombardy region in Italy. Six cases that followed were also reported to be of linked
either to travel to Lombardy or through contact with the first patient 10. Similarly, in
Iceland the first reported case was also on February 28, 2020 from a returning traveler
from Northern Italy with five cases that followed linked to Verona, Italy 10. It is
therefore likely that strains harboring these polymorphisms exist in Northern Italy but
there is currently limited sequence data deposited on the specific viral strains in the
most affected regions. In further support of this expectation, sequences deposited
from the Brazilian government indicate the likely source of virus for the small number
of strains with the KR-LGG haplotype in Brazil is Northern Italy. Similarly, the

source for the KR-LGG strains in Chile, Mexico and Nigeria has also been indicated
as Northern Italy.

As of March 31, 2020 there appears to be only a small proportion of strains with KRLGG in the US, likely reflecting that deposited sequences have been mainly from the
West coast of the US that experienced initial importation of Asian strains of SARSCoV-2. It will be of great interest to see sequences from the East coast of the US
given the early importation of SARS-CoV-2 from Northern Europe as well as Asia
and the widespread community transmission that has followed (Figure 1A).

Interestingly, the M175 polymorphism in the membrane glycoprotein appears to only
be present on the KR-LGG combination (of the 132 sequences with this
polymorphism 131 are from Europe and 1 from North America) (Supplementary
Table 2). When the other common polymorphisms (>5%) observed in the NSP2,
NSP6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), membrane glycoprotein and
helicase are taken into account, there are at present eight main circulating strains at
>5% frequency in the database all within one to three amino acid polymorphism
networks (Supplementary Table 2).

Of note, our current knowledge of the global circulating strains is dependent on the
ability of laboratories in different countries to deposit full genome length SARS-CoV2 sequences and may be subject to ascertainment bias. As such, the frequencies of
specific strains shown in Figure 1 may not reflect the size of the outbreak. However,
the data does provide the opportunity to predict the presence of specific strains in
areas given the known epidemiology within different countries and regions.

SARS-CoV-2 and Host Adaptation: Implications for global viral dynamics,
pathogenesis and immunogenicity
Currently the possible functional effect(s) of the introduction of the AAACGA motif
into the nucleocapsid are not known. The nucleocapsid protein is a key structural
protein critical to viral transcription and assembly, suggesting that changes in this
protein could either increase or decrease replicative fitness. However, it is also
possible these changes could be functionally compensated by linked polymorphism in
the virus and/or counterbalanced by some other host fitness benefit. However, we
have not found any other polymorphism linked to the K203/R204 change to date.

Selection of viral adaptations to polymorphic host responses mediated by T cells, NKcells, antibodies and antiviral drugs are well described for other RNA viruses such as
HIV and HCV

T-cell responses have also been shown to be transmitted and accumulate over time

. As previously shown for SARS-CoV, T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 are

likely to target the nucleocapsid

. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 R203K/G204R

polymorphisms modify the predicted binding of the HLA-C*07 allele to a putative Tcell epitope containing these residues. Escape from HLA-C-restricted T-cell responses
may conceivably confer a fitness advantage for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in
European populations where HLA-C*07 is prevalent and carried by >40% of the
population (www.allelefrequencies.net).

The replication characteristics and plasticity of small, highly mutable viruses such as
HIV and HCV are distinct from SARS-CoV-2, which is significantly less variable.

However, the fact that a number of variants are established in the human pandemic
indicates some capacity for successful viral diversification in response to host
immunogenetic heterogeneity. The consequences of viral host adaptation for SARSCoV-2 immunopathogenesis may also be complex. If SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses
define the specific nature of the clinical illness, such adaptation may serve to favor
prolonged, perhaps asymptomatic viral shedding. This phenomena has been
demonstrated in the case of mutations in the influenza genome, with deleterious
public health consequences for transmission and control

15

. If the host response to

SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the efficacy or regulation of a specific antiviral
cytotoxic T-cell response, adaptation may also impact individual pathways to serious
complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and other end-organ
disease. However, it is important to realize that as evidenced by HCV, HIV and other
RNA viruses, any change in replicative fitness cost to the virus will not predictably
translate to any attenuation of the nature of the disease in the host. As SARS-CoV-2
becomes globally established over a longer period of time, evolution towards a less
immunogenic, but still highly transmissible infection could be facilitated by fixation
and spread of immune-based selection events. This has been postulated to be the case
for other human-adapted coronaviruses that eventually became established as seasonal
âcommon coldâ viruses.

Marked viral diversity and adaptation of other RNA viruses such as HIV and HCV to
highly polymorphic host immune proteins such as HLA that restrict the immune
response has been a barrier to successful vaccination to date. With the widespread
global spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus across genetically diverse populations it will also
be critical to elucidate the functional consequences of any newly emerging genetic
