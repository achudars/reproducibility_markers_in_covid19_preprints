Abstract

16

Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is the mainstay for accurate diagnosis of the infection,

17

but the diagnostic performances of available assays have not been defined. We compared

18

12 molecular diagnostic assays, including 8 commercial kits using 155 respiratory

19

samples (65 nasopharyngeal swabs, 45 oropharyngeal swabs, and 45 sputum) collected at

20

2 Japanese hospitals. Sixty-eight samples were positive for more than one assay and one

21

genetic locus and were defined as true positive samples. All the assays showed a

22

specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 95.8 to 100). The N2 assay kit of the US

23

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the N2 assay of the Japanese

24

National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) were the most sensitive assays with 100%

25

sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 94.7 to 100), followed by the CDC N1 kit, E assay

26

by Corman, and NIID N2 assay multiplex with internal control reactions . These assays

27

are reliable as first-line molecular assays in laboratories when combined with appropriate

28

internal control reactions.

Introduction
Accurate detection tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

32

(SARS-CoV-2) are important to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

33

pandemic (1). Various molecular diagnostic assays have been developed and used

34

worldwide (1-4), but the differences in their diagnostic performances remain poorly

35

understood. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of 12 molecular assays.

36
37

Materials and Methods

38

Clinical specimens

39

A total of 923 upper or lower respiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal swabs

40

and oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport media or sputum) were collected from 446

41

patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 between January and May 2020 at Kyoto

42

University Hospital and Kyoto City Hospital. In this study, we included all 68

43

SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and 87 randomly selected negative samples from 107

44

patients.

45

RNA extraction

46

The respiratory samples were prospectively stored at −80°C after stabilization by

47

mixing an equal volume of DNA/RNA Shield (2X concentrate; Zymo Research, Irvine,

48

CA). The thawed samples were centrifuged at 20,000×g for 2 min. RNA was extracted

49

from 140 μL of the supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,

50

Germany) with RNA extraction controls—5 μL of LightMix® Modular EAV RNA

51

Extraction Control (EAV; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) or 10 μL of MS2 phage (Thermo

52

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)—and eluted in a final volume of 60 μL.

53

Molecular assays

54

Table 1 shows the molecular assays evaluated in this study. Real-time RT-PCRs

55

were performed using N1, N2, and RNaseP (RP) internal control assays developed by the

60

with TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We also

61

tested the LightMix® Modular assays (Roche) for E, RdRP, and N genes multiplexed

62

with EAV, the Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR kit for detecting 2019-nCoV (BGI

63

Biotechnology, Wuhan, China), and the TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo

64

Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The above reactions were

65

performed using a LightCycler® 480 System II (Roche), and cycle threshold (Ct) values

66

were determined by the second derivative maximum method, except for the CDC N1/N2

67

and TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit assays, which were performed using Applied

68

Biosystems® 7500 Fast or QuantStudio5 Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher

69

Scientific) using a fixed threshold of 0.1. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification

70

(LAMP) assay was performed using a Loopamp® SARS-CoV-2 detection kit and

71

LoopampEXIA® real-time turbidimeter (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan).

72

Analytical sensitivity

73

We determined the limit of detection (LOD) of each assay using a minimum of

74

four replicates of two-fold serial dilutions of recombinant Sindbis virus containing a

75

partial SARS-CoV-2 genome (AccuPlex™ SARS-CoV-2 Reference Material Kit, 5,000

76

copies/mL; SeraCare, Milford, MA, USA). We calculated the 95% limit of detection

77

(LOD) using probit analysis.

78

Statistical analysis

79

At the time manuscript preparation, no gold standard exists. In this study, to

80

ensure the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and to avoid false-positives, a sample was

81

defined as positive when positive test results were obtained for more than one genetic

82

locus and assay and the others were defined as negative. The agreement of the assays was

83

assessed by the Cohen’s kappa concordance coefficient. The sensitivity and specificity

84

were compared using the McNemar test. The sensitivity of different specimen types was

85

compared using the Fisher’s exact test. The Ct value were compared using the Kruskal–

86

Wallis test or a Mann–Whitney U test. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically

87

significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS® Studio 3.8 (SAS Institute

88

Inc., Cary, NC).

Results

94

A total of 155 study samples (65 nasopharyngeal swabs, 45 oropharyngeal swabs,

95

and 45 sputum samples) were tested using the 12 assays. Sixty-eight samples (35

96

nasopharyngeal swabs, 15 oropharyngeal swabs, and 18 sputum samples) were positive

97

for more than one assay and one genetic locus and were defined as true positive samples ;

98

the other samples were considered true negative. A full list of the results with Ct values

99

is available as Dataset S1.

100

All the assays exhibited a specificity of 100%, while sensitivity varied (Table 2). The

101

CDC N1, CDC N2, NIID N2 (with/without EAV), and Corman E assays were the most

102

sensitive assays with ≥95.6% sensitivity. These 5 assays displayed high overall

103

agreement compared with the reference standard (kappa values of ≥0.96) and between

104

any two of them (kappa values of ≥0.95). The CDC N2 and NIID N2 assays exhibited

105

100% sensitivity; thus, their results were equal to the defined reference standard. The

106

sensitivities of the remaining 7 assays (Corman N, Roche E, Roche RdRP, Roche N,

107

Thermo Combo, BGI and LAMP assays; ≤88.2%) were significantly lower than those of

108

the most sensitive assays.

109

The CDC protocol requires both N1 and N2 assays, and a sample will be

110

considered positive if both produced positive results. In this study, one true positive

111

nasopharygeal sample was positive only for the N2 assay even after retesting. The

112

sample was considered inconclusive and the performance of the CDC protocol was

113

considered the same as the CDC N1 assay. The NIID protocol includes both NIID N2 and

114

Corman N assays, and a sample will be considered positive if either assay produces a

115

positive result. In this study, 69.1% of samples were positive for both assays, and 30.9%

116

were positive for only the N2 assay. The protocol by Corman recommended an E assay

117

that detects SARS-related viruses (Sarbecovirus) as a first-line screening assay and then

118

SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRP assay for confirmatory testing (1). This approach defined

119

only 49.2% of the Roche E assay-positive samples as SARS-CoV-2, although a single

120

positive result of the Corman E or Roche E assay can be interpreted as SARS -CoV-2

121

positive in the absence of other Sarbecovirus. Assays with multiplexed internal control

122

reactions and the CDC RNaseP assay yielded positive signals for all samples.

123

Table 3 shows diagnostic performances for each specimen type. Nasopharyngeal

124

swabs tended to have a higher sensitivity than the other samples. The sensitivity of

125

Corman N assay for sputum samples and that of Roche N assay for oropharyngeal swabs

126

and sputum samples were significantly lower than those for nasopharyngeal swabs. The

127

Ct values of CDC N2 and NIID N2 assays for nasopharyngeal swabs (median

128

[interquartile range], 27.1 [23.6–31.1] and 29.7 [26.3–33.3], respectively) were lower

129

than those for oropharyngeal swabs (31.5 [29.9–35.0] and 33.0 [32.0–34.6]) or sputum

130

samples (30.0 [25.6–33.5] and 30.9 [28.3–34.0]) but the differences did not reach

131

statistical significance (P=0.11 and 0.16 by comparison among 3 specimen types,

132

respectively). The sputum samples had the lower Ct values of the CDC RNaseP assay

133

(25.6 [23.6–27.8]) than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs (28.2 [26.9–29.6],

134

P<0.001 and 28.8 [26.9–31.0], P<0.001, respectively).

135

The lowest LOD was observed for the CDC N2 assay (136 copies/mL or 1.6

136

copies/reaction). The other assays which showed the high sensitivities in clinical samples

137

(CDC N1, NIID N2, and Corman E assays) displayed LODs of 191–271 copies/mL. The

LODs of the Roche RdRP and N assays were high (>5,000 copies/mL).

Discussion

141

The current diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly relies on RT-PCR tests (6). We

142

performed manufacturer-independent evaluation of the molecular assays, including

143

commercial kits that utilize otherwise-extracted RNA templates. We found that the

144

specificity was perfect for all the assays and that the CDC N1, CDC N2, NIID N2, and

145

Corman E assays were the most sensitive and highly concordant (7). Genetic variations

146

that may compromise sensitivity of the CDC N1, N2, and Corman E assays have been

147

rarely observed as of week 21 of 2020 (8). False negatives by the other assays occurred

148

among low-copy number samples (presenting high Ct values by the CDC N2 or NIID N2

149

assay; Dataset S1), suggesting a lack of sensitivity of these assays.

150

The Roche assays were based on Corman’s assays (1) but had lower sensitivity

151

for their E and N assays. This is likely due to lower Ct cutoffs for the Roche assays,

152

rather than differences in reagents and reaction conditions (Table 1 and Dataset S1).

153

Previous studies reported that N assay was less sensitive than the E and RdRP assays (1)

154

and the RdRP assay was less sensitive than the Roche E assay (3). The low sensitivity of

155

the Roche RdRP and N assays were concordant with their high LODs (Table 4). The low

156

sensitivity of the BGI assay may be due to the inclusion of human gene interna l controls

157

in the same reaction, which could prevent amplification of viral genes, especially in

158

human genome-enriched samples. The LAMP assay can be used in a resource-poor

159

setting and has the fastest assay time due to its isothermal reaction. However, it had a

160

low sensitivity and no control reaction. The lower sensitivities observed for

161

oropharyngeal and/or sputum samples might be related to higher viral copies (lower Ct

162

values) in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or higher copies of human genes (lower Ct values

163

of the CDC RNaseP Assay) in sputum samples.

164

To avoid false negatives due to technical errors such as extraction problems or

165

PCR inhibition, it is recommended to include internal control reactions. The CDC assays

166

were designed to be combined with a separate internal control reaction (Table 1).

167

Different from multiplex assays that incorporate internal controls such as Roche, Thermo,

168

or BGI kits, this approach needs extra reagents, time, and space in a reaction plate but

169

can be combined with other in-house assays (NIID N2 or Corman E) without any

170

modification. For the multiplex approach, we selected the NIID N2 assay to be

171

multiplexed with the Roche EAV kit, resulting in the similar performance as the original

172

NIID N2 assay.

173

To date, two published reports have compared performances of multiple RT-PCR

174

assays using clinical samples. Nalla (9) et al. compared CDC N1/N2/N3 and Corman

175

E/RdRP among 10 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. They reported that the CDC N2 and

176

Corman E assays were the most sensitive. van Kasteren et al. compared 7 commercial

177

kits, including 13 positive and 6 negative samples (10). When compared with the Corman

178

E assay, the R-Biopharm AG performed the best, followed by BGI, KH Medical, and

179

Seegene. These reports are in agreement with our findings.

180

The study limitations included a relatively small sample size of each specimen

181

type and lack of clinical information, measurements by multiple investigators, and

182

genomic variation analysis.

183

In conclusion, we validated the NIID N2 assay with EAV control reaction and

184

found that the CDC EUA kit (N1/N2/RNaseP), NIID N2 with/without EAV, and Corman

185

E assays were the most sensitive assays. They are feasible as reference s and clinical

186

diagnostic tests until commercial kits with internal control reactions or fully automated

187

systems that have high diagnostic performances are available in clinical laboratories.

188

Continuous efforts to improve COVID-19 diagnostics are important to control this

189

pandemic.

a

Calculated against the defined reference standard.

250

b

All samples yielded positive signals in separate CDC RNaseP reactions. The CDC N1 assay

251

was negative, but CDC N2 assay was positive for 2 true positive samples. Repeat testing showed

252

that one sputum sample was positive for both assays while results of the other nasopharygeal

253

sample were unchanged. Thus, the former was considered positive and the latter was considered

254

inconclusive as the results of the CDC assay.

All reactions yielded positive signals for control targets.

was positive again with Ct value of 39.12 and was considered positive.

Seven samples were positive for only the N gene that warranted repeat testing. Repeat testing

Four samples were positive, but the Ct values were >38, which warranted repeat testing. Repeat
