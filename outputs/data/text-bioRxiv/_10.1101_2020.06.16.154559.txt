Abstract The recent pandemic of COVID19 that has struck the world is yet to be battled by a potential
cure. Countless lives have been claimed due to the existing pandemic and the societal
normalcy has been damaged permanently. As a result, it becomes crucial for academic
researchers in the field of bioinformatics to combat the existing pandemic. The study
involved collecting the virulent strain sequence of SARS-nCoV19 for the country USA
against human host through publically available bioinformatics databases. Using in-silica
analysis and reverse vaccinology, two leader proteins were identified to be potential vaccine
candidates for development of a multi-epitope drug. The results of this study can provide
further researchers better aspects and direction on developing vaccine and immune responses
against COVID19. This work also aims at promoting the use of existing bioinformatics tools
to faster streamline the pipeline of vaccine development.
Keywords: in-silica analysis, SARS-CoV2, bioinformatics, reverse vaccinology, strain

The Situation of COVID19
A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in
Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this
disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV.
This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal
respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly
linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually,
human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans.
[13].
Since then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At
the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146
countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a
rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a
“global health emergency”. [14].

Current Scenario and Objectives
Currently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and
genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been
developed at the time of writing this article.
Though, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome
caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different. Studies
have indicated that –

“SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.”
-World Health Organization

The spread of SARS epidemic has provided with any useful insights as during that time the
virus epidemic was contained only through general prevention means and treatment of the
individual symptoms. As a result, there exists only a limited number of tools available to test
the coronavirus for their ability to infect humans. This has acted as a major limitation for
predicting the next zoonotic viral outbreak. [13-15].
In response to the current medical crisis, the World Health Organization has activated the R&D
Blueprint for the acceleration of the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for
treatment of this novel coronavirus.
The objective of this study lies in compliance to the guidelines for research activated by WHO.
This study aims to utilize a reverse-vaccinology approach in order to identify potential vaccine
candidates for COVID19 for the country USA. We shall be deploying open-access
bioinformatics tools for our analysis of the same.

Materials and Methods
Strain Selection
The virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 was selected for in-silico analysis. The genome of the
viral strain is made available by NCBI - National Center for Biotechnology Information
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.in).
The reference identification for SARS-CoV-2 is given by RefSeq NC_045512.2

Protein Identification and Retrieval
14534 viral protein sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the ViPR – Virus
Pathogen Database and Analysis. [1]. These protein sequences were identified and
downloaded in a tabular format for the Host – Humans and the Country – USA.

Table 1. The above table depicts randomly selected four protein sequences obtained out of
the 14534 collected under the ViPR databases along with their respective properties. Apart
from the properties mentioned in the above table, other parameters obtained from the ViPR
databases included the Protein Length, Maturation Status, Collection Data, Entire Protein
Sequence Availability, Strain Name etc.

Physiochemical Property Analysis
The FASTA-file for all the 14535 protein sequences was downloaded and loaded in R using
“SeqinR” and “Biostrings” packages. The different physicochemical properties were
analysed using the “Peptides” package in the R. [2-4].

Protein Antigenicity
VaxiJen 2.0 is used to predict the antigenicity of the protein based on the FASTA-files that
contain their respective amino acid sequences. The online software predicts the antigenic
score for the same. [5-6].

B-Cell and T-Cell Epitope Prediction
The T-cell and B-cell epitopes of the selected two leader protein sequences were predicted
using the IEDB (The Immune Epitope Database). IEDB is a freely available resource funded
by NIAID. It is a catalog that contains the experimental data on antibody and T cell epitopes
studied in humans, non-human primates, and other animal species in the context of the
infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity, and transplantation. It also assists in hosting tools
for predicting and analysing the epitopes. [7].

For MHC Class-I T-cell epitope prediction for ORF1ab leader proteins, NetMHCpan EL 4.0
method was used. This method was applied for the HLA-A*11-01 allele. For MHC Class-II
T-cell epitope prediction for ORF1ab leader proteins, Sturniolo prediction method was used.
This method was applied for the HLA DRB1*04-01 allele. For B-cell lymphocyte epitope
prediction, Bepipered Prediction Method was used. [8].
Ten epitopes were selected on random for analysis of their antigenicity, allergenicity,
topology and conservancy.

Allergenicity, Topology and Toxicity Prediction of the predicted Epitopes
AllerTOP v2 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/) was used for determining the
allergenicity of selected epitopes. ToxinPred server
(https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/protein.php) was used to determining the toxicity
of the selected epitopes. The prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins was determined
using the TMHMM Server v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/).

Prediction of Conservancy of the Epitopes selected
The conservancy of the selected epitopes was analysed using the conservancy analysis tool of
the IEDB server. For this analysis, the parameter for the sequence identity threshold was
adjusted to ‘>=50’. [7].

3D Structure Generation for Epitopes selected
In order to generate the 3D structure of the epitopes choses, the PEP-FOLD3 tool was used.
PEP-FOLD (http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.r/services/PEP-FOLD3/) uses a de novo
approach to predict the peptide sequences from the amino acid sequences. [9-11]. It utilizes
the structural alphabet SA letters to describe the conformations of four consecutive residues.

Molecular Docking of the Epitopes selected
The pre-docking of the selected epitopes was done using the UCSF Chimera. It was also used
to perform pre-docking of the selected alleles HLA-A*11-01 (for MHC Class-I) and HLA
DRB1*04-01.
Later, the docking of the peptide-protein was done using HPEPDOCK. HPEPDOCK is a web
server of performing blind peptide-protein utilizing hierarchical algorithm. [12]. Instead of
performing length stimulations to refine peptide conformations, HPEPDOCK studies the
peptide flexibility through an ensemble of peptide conformations produced by the MODPEP
program.

Results
Selection and Retrieval of Potential Vaccine Candidate information
The SARS-CoV-2 strain was identified. All the 14534 protein sequences were analysed on the
basis of the physicochemical properties to select the top five candidates for further analysis.
For the physicochemical analysis, the number of amino acids, instability index, aliphatic
index, and the grand average of hydrophobicity (GRAVY) scores of the all the 14,534
proteins were taken using the Peptides package in R. This packages allows the identification,
selection and analysis of multiple amino acid sequences in the same FASTA-file. Hence, it
was utilized.

Table 2. Physicochemical property analysis for SARS-CoV-2 against the top five viral
proteins having the lowest GRAVY scores and confirmed stability out of the 14,534
proteins obtained from ViPR database.

The physicochemical study unveiled five potential candidates having the lowest score of
GRAVY and instability index less than 40 (hence, displaying stability). These five candidates
were individually analysed for their molar extinction coefficients and antigenicity.

Antigenicity and Extinction Coefficients of the Potential Candidates
The VaxiJen 2.0 tool was used to analyse the antigenicity of the potential five candidates and
the molar extinction coefficient was analysed using the ExPASy’s online tool –ProtParam.
Out of the five potential candidates, only two were selected for further analysis. This was
based on the criteria of having the highest score of predicted antigenicity and highest values
of the extinction coefficients.

Both the leader proteins were then used for further analysis.

T-cell and B-cell Epitope Prediction
The T-cell epitopes of the MHC Class-I for both the leader protein were determined using the
NetMHCpan EL 4.0 prediction method of the IEDB server keeping the sequence length at 9.
This tool allows the generation of the epitopes and sorts them on the basis of their percentile
scores. Randomly, ten potential epitopes were selected randomly for the antigenicity,
allergenicity, toxicity, and conservancy tests.
For MHC class-II, T-cell epitopes (HLA DRB1*04-01 allele) of the proteins were also
determined using the IEDB Analysis tools. The Sturniolo prediction methods were used for
the same. Again, ten potential candidates were chosen based on the same criteria as that of
MHC Class-I.
The B-cell epitopes of the proteins were selected using the Bepipered Linear Epitope
Prediction method of the IEDB server.

Topology Identification of the Epitope
The topology of the chosen epitopes was determined using the TMHMM v2.0 server
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The potential T-cell epitopes, whose topology,

Antigenicity, Allergenicity, Toxicity, and Conservancy Analysis of the Epitopes
On the analysis of the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and conservancy analysis of the Tcell epitopes, it was found that most of them were antigenic, simultaneously being nonallergenic, non-toxic and higher values of conservancy. From the ten selected MHC Class-I
and MHC Class-II T-cell epitopes, one from each category were selected from both the leader
proteins. The criteria for being selected was having the higher antigenic scores, nonallergenicity, non-toxicity, and conservancy value above 90%.
The selected epitopes were: RSDARTAPH, VQLNNNNNN, LSLPVLQVR, and VQLSLPVLQ.

The B-cell epitopes of the ORF1ab leader proteins are displayed in the following two figures.

Peptide-Protein Docking using HPEPDOCK Server
HPEPDOCK Server was used to perform docking of the peptide and protein. The purpose of
the same was to analyse which of the two selected T-cell MHC Class-I epitope:
RSDARTAPH and LSLPVLQVR had the lowest global energy. The epitope having the
lowest global energy acts as a better vaccine candidate. The docking was performed against
the HLA-A*11-01 allele whose pdb format was obtained through pre-docking using UCSF
Chimera.
The global energy for the selected Class-I epitopes were: -182.706 and -191.198 respectively
for RSDARTAPH and LSLPVLQVR. Out of the two MHC Class-I epitopes selected for
leader proteins ORF1ab MT326102 and MT326175, the global energy was lowest for
LSLPVLQVR.

Figure 4. The peptide LSLPVLQVR is shown in the surface (yellow) format which has
been docked against the HLA-A*11-01, displayed in the ribbon format. The format of the
allele and the peptide are differed on purpose to show distinction.

For the MHC Class-II T-cell epitope, the docking was performed against the HLA
DRB1*04-01 allele. Same procedure was followed as mentioned before. The two selected
epitopes after the previous analysis were: VQLNNNNNN and VQLSLPVLQ. The global
energy for the selected epitopes were -203.369 and -238.196 respectively.

MT326102 and MT326175, the lowest global energy was of VQLSLPVLQ.

Figure 5. The peptide VQLSLPVLQ is shown in the surface (yellow) format which has
been docked against the HLA DRB1*04-01, displayed in the ribbon format. The format of
the allele and the peptide are differed on purpose to show distinction

Results and Discussion
The scope of this study involved performing an in-silica analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 viral
strain for the country of USA against human host. The ViPR database was used for the same
to obtain all the protein sequences. A total of 14534 viral protein sequences were obtained
whose extensive physicochemical analysis was done to select a group of two. This extensive
analysis was performed using Peptides package in the R Software.
It was revealed that the two leader proteins ORF1ab MT326102 and MT326715 had the
highest extinction coefficient and the lowest score on the GRAVY. Along with the given
parameters, these leader proteins were highly stable and were also antigenic in nature.
The FASTA-formatted files of these selected proteins were taken and analysed to obtain the
potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes. The T-cell epitopes of MHC Class-1 and MHC Class-II
were analysed on the basis of their scores. Ten randomly selected T-cell epitopes from both
the classes were taken for further analysis of allergenicity, toxicity, conservancy scores and
antigenicity. Only one epitope from both the classes was selected which possessed a higher
conservancy score (more than 90%), was non-toxic, non-allergic and antigenic in nature.
The two selected epitopes were then docked against their respective alleles to obtain the
global energy scores. The epitopes which displayed the lowest global energy score on
docking with the alleles were selected and proposed as successful and potential vaccine
candidates
