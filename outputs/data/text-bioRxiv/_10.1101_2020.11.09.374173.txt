Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play essential roles in regulating
physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Many virus use their own IDPs to
“hack” these processes to disactive host defenses and promote viral growth.
Thus, viral IDPs are attractive drug targets. While IDPs are hard to study by Xray crystallography or cryo-EM, atomic level information on their conformational
perferences and dynamics can be obtained using NMR spectroscopy. SARSCoV-2 Nsp2 interacts with human proteins that regulate translation initiation and
endosome vesicle sorting, and the C-terminal region of this protein is predicted
to be disordered. Molecules that block these interactions could be valuable leads
for drug development.

To enable inhibitor screening and to uncover

conformational preferences and dynamics, we have expressed and purified the
13

C,15N-labeled C-terminal region of Nsp2. The

spectra.

Overall, the chemical shift data confirm that this region is chiefly

disordered, but contains two five-residue segments that adopt a small population
of b-strand structure. Whereas the region is flexible on ms/ms timescales as
gauged by T1r measurements, the {1H}-15N NOEs reveal a flexibility on ns/ps
timescales that is midway between a fully flexible and a completely rigid chain.

Introduction
The pandemic provoke by Sars-CoV-2 is sparking unprecedented efforts in the
development of vaccine. Nevertheless, drugs which block the activity of viral
proteins should also be sought, since Sars-CoV-2 vaccines may well lack
availability, public acceptance and complete efficacy, particularly for the immune
compromised. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play essential roles in
regulating physiological processes in eukaryotic cells by forming weak
protein/protein interactions. Many virus use their own IDPs to “hack” these
processes to disactive host defenses and promote viral growth (Davey et al.,
2011). Thus, viral IDPs are attractive drug targets. While the flexibility of IDPs
generally precludes their study by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM, atomic level
information on their conformational preferences and dynamics can be obtained
using NMR spectroscopy.
Using bioinformatics tools, a C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2 has
been predicted to be disordered (Giri et al., 2020). Interestingly, this Nsp2 region
appears to be more disordered in SARS-CoV-2 than in its close homologs human
SARS (responsible for the 2003 outbreak) and bat coronavirus (see Sup. Fig. 9
in Giri et al., 2020).

A recent study (Gordon et al., 2020) of the SARS-CoV-2

interactome reported that Nsp2 interacts with human proteins GIGYF2 and
EIF4E2, which regulate translation initiation, as well as WASHC4 and FKBP15,
which are involved in endosome vesicle sorting. Nsp2 from human SARS was
also reported to interact with Prohibitin1/2, a cell proliferation modulator with
tumor suppression activity (Cornilley-Ty et al., 2009). Molecules that block these
interactions could be valuable leads for drug development. The main objective
of this study is to characterize the conformational preferences and dynamics of
the putatively disordered C-terminal region of SARS CoV-2 Nsp2 (Nsp2 CtDR)
using NMR spectroscopy. The assignments obtained could also guide future
studies of interactions between Nsp2, human target proteins and inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Bioinformatics: The algorithm PrDOS (Ishida & Kinoshita, 2007) was used to
predict the disordered regions in the Nsp2 sequence. The default setting for 5%
false positives was used. This method consists of two predictors, one based on
the local sequence composition and a second based on the level of sequence
conservation in homologous proteins.
Sample production and isotopic labeling: To enable inhibitor screening and to
uncover conformational preferences and dynamics, we have expressed and
purified the

13

C,15N-labeled C-terminal region of Nsp2.

The full production

methodology will be reported soon [Covid19-NMR Consortium, 2020]. Briefly,
the

segment

C-terminus of Nsp2 was expressed in minimal media containing 15NH4Cl and 13Cglucose as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively, and the domain
was purified using the His-tag / Ni++ column chromatography approach.
NMR spectroscopy:

13

C,15N-labeled Nsp2 CtDR at

pH 6.3 in 5.0 mM Na2HPO4 / NaH2PO4 buffer with 10.0 mM NaCl, 10% D2O and
sodium trimethylsilypropanesulfonate (DSS) as the internal chemical shift
reference. Two series of spectra were recorded at 5 ºC, one with and one without

were recorded on a Bruker Neo 800 MHz (1H) spectrometer equipped with a
cryoprobe and z-gradients. The NMR spectral parameters are listed in Table 1.
The spectra were transformed with Topspin 4.0.8 (Bruker Biospin) and were
assigned manually with the aid of the program Sparky (Lee et al., 2015). In
addition, a series of 2D 1H-15N HSQC-based experiments were recorded to
determine the {1H}-15N NOE and R1r relaxation rates in order to assess dynamics
on ps/ns and µs/ms timescales, respectively. These spectra were recorded

without non-uniform sampling and were transformed without applying linear
prediction. Peak integrals were measured using Topspin 4.0.8. R1r relaxation
rates were obtained by using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software,
version 3.6) to fit an exponential equation: I(t) = Io· exp(-k·t) + I∞, where I(t) is
the peak integral at time t, k is the rate, and I∞ is the intensity at infinite time. The
R1r uncertainties reported here are those obtained from the least squares fit. In
the case of the {1H}-15N NOE ratios, the uncertainties were calculated as the ratio
of the noise (estimated as the standard deviation of the integral of several areas
lacking peaks) times √2 to the peak integral measured without applying the NOE.

Results
1. Bioinformatics analysis: The C-terminal region of Nsp2 was recently predicted
to be disordered by Giri et al., 2020, who applied the PONDR® and IUPRED
algorithms.

Nevertheless, this region contains a rather high proportion of

hydrophobic residues which generally promote order and folding. To corroborate
these findings, we have applied the same tools as Giri et al., 2020 as well as the
PrDOS disorder prediction algorithm (Ishida & Kinoshita, 2007) to the Nsp2
sequence (Figure 1). Whereas the results show that the C-terminal region
spanning approximately residues 555 – 600 have a high disorder propensity as
compared to the rest of the protein, the score falls short of the threshold for some
algorithms used by Giri et al., (2020) (Fig. 1B) and is close to the threshold for
PrDOSfor predicting disordered (Figure 1). Considering this finding, and the fact
that disorder prediction programs are sometimes wrong (Treviño et al, 2018), we
have used NMR spectroscopy to characterize structurally the putatively
disordered region of Nsp2.

conformational chemical shifts (Dd) values are shown in Figure 3. Overall, the
Dd values are low, which evinces that the Nsp2 CtDR is disordered. However,
two five-residues stretches spanning residues E570-VLTE574 and S591EAVE595
tend to adopt b-stands.

The populations of these b-strands within the

conformational ensemble is about 10%. In addition, a few discontinuous residues
at the N-terminus of this region also show some tendency to adopt b-stand
conformations (Figure 3). It is important to point out that the sample whose His
tag was cleaved contained an additional proteolytic cleavage between residues
K579-T580, which was identified on the basis of chemical shift alterations, the
absence of an 1H-15N crosspeak for T580 and the relaxation measurements
reported below. This break occurs between the two b-strands mentioned above.
Since the b-strand populations for E570-E574 and S591-E595 are similar in both
samples, this suggests that no interaction between these b-strands is necessary
for them to form.
3. Dynamics:

Disordered proteins are often somewhat rigid; this helps

predispose them for interactions with other molecules and to adopt specific
conformations.

To assess the µs-ms dynamics, we measured transverse

relaxation rates in the rotating time frame (R1r) for the Nsp2 CtDR. Generally
low values are found which reflect flexibility (Figure 4A). The presence of the
His tag and the lack of cleavage at the K579-T580 site appear to stiffen the
polypeptide somewhat. Higher than average values are detected for residues
E570-E574 and S591-E595 which adopt a small b-strand population.
Regarding the ps-ns timescale dynamics, {1H}-15N NOE measurements
show ratios about halfway between those indicative of full rigidity and complete
flexibility (Figure 4B). Thus, the Nsp2 CtDR is significantly more rigid than fully
unfolded proteins.

Discussion
In this communication, we show that the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV2 of Nsp2 is intrinsically disordered, which is in general agreement with
bioinformatics predictions (Giri et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, two five-residue
stretches show a small, but significant tendency to adopt b-strand conformations,
and the region is more rigid than a completely disordered protein chain. These
findings may be attributed to the content of aliphatic residues: two Ile, four Pro,
five Val and seven Leu, which is rather high for a disordered region. These
results seem not to depend on the presence of an N-terminal His tag or an internal
proteolytic cleavage. Nevertheless, additional experiments on the Nsp2 intact
CtDR without the His tag, which are underway, are necessary to confirm these
findings. These b-strands may participate in interactions with human proteins
and future experiments will test whether their degree of structure and rigidity
increase upon binding. Blocking such an interaction might be an excellent target
for future farmaceutics. Inhibitor screening of the Nsp2 CtDR in collaboration with
the COVID19-NMR consortium is starting. In the future, the assigned 1H-15N
spectrum could serve to identify where first-generation inhibitors bind and thereby
help guide their improvement.
