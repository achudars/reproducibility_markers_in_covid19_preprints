Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or nCovid-19) outbreak has
become a huge public health issue due to its rapid transmission and global pandemic. Currently,
there are no vaccines or drugs available for nCovid-19, hence early detection is crucial to help
and manage the outbreak. Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and
compare it with a commercial potentiostat for the detection of nCovid-19 spike antigen
(nCovid-19Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using
fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized
with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19Ab) to measure change in the electrical
conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by
immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of
both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19Ab with its specific nCovid-19Ag.
Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and eCovSens displayed high
sensitivity for detection of nCovid-19Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 µM. Our in-house developed
device can successfully detect nCovid-19Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is
in close agreement with FTO/AuNPs sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90
fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples. The proposed
portable eCovSens device can be used as a diagnostic tool for the rapid (within 10-30 s)
detection of nCovid-19Ag traces directly in patient saliva in a non-invasive manner.

1. Introduction:
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia was observed in Wuhan, China and the causative
pathogen was identified as a new type of coronavirus (Chan et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Ren
et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‐
nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). By comparing taxonomy, phylogeny, and
established practice, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses established this virus to be related to severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and renamed it as SARS‐CoV‐2 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020). SARSCoV-2 is a single positive strand RNA virus consisting of four structural proteins including
spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins and is responsible for
respiratory tract illness in humans (Li et al., 2020a). According to recent studies, SARS-CoV2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cellular entry making the
use of spike (S) protein with high affinity towards ACE2 (Tian et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020).
As of 24th April, 2020, the total number of nCovid-19 cases in the world have surpassed 2
million with 27,25,920 fatalities globally. With more than half the world under lock-down in
order to contain the spread of this pandemic, with no immediate vaccine available, it has
become the need of the hour to develop rapid detection methods to diagnose nCovid-19 in both
symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients (Mizumoto et al., 2020) that would enable early
mitigation. For early diagnosis, chest computed tomography (CT) (Bai et al., 2020; Bernheim
et al., 2020; Li and Xia, 2020; Pan et al., 2020a) was used whereas in the analytical stage, realtime reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Chu et al., 2020; Corman et
al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020) remains the standard test for the
etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (Ai et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020). Recently, antibody and
CRISPR based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools for rapid diagnosis (Li
et al., 2020b; Ding et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).
Biosensors have the advantage of being sensitive, specific, stable, easy to use, require less
sample size, time, portable, and most importantly can be customised to detect the target analyte
of interest. Immunosensors can be used to detect toxins (Kasoju et al., 2020a), narcotic drugs
(Gandhi et al., 2018, Mishra et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2017; Tey et al., 2010) viruses (Kerry et
al., 2019) by use of different bioreceptors such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Jiang et al.,
2005; Labuda et al., 2009), enzymes (Ilangovan et al., 2006; Jawaheer et al., 2003), peptides
(Gandhi et al., 2016), aptamers (Kasoju et al., 2020b), antibody (Islam et al., 2019; Roberts et
al., 2019). Electrochemical biosensors are considered as a reliable tool for infectious disease
detection as they remain unaffected by sample absorbance or turbidity (Bakker, 2004). In order
to increase the sensitivity of electrochemical biosensors, nanomaterials are often made use of
a signal amplifiers such as graphene (Islam et al., 2019), and AuNPs (Pingarrón et al., 2008).
In this work, we have developed an in-house built device named as eCovSens using an SPCE
electrode and compared it with a potentiostat using FTO electrode. The comparison was made
in terms of sensitivity, specificity, time of detection, sample volume, portability, and stability.
Here, FTO electrodes have been preferred over indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes due to its

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059204; this version posted May 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

high electrical conductivity, chemical stability under atmospheric conditions, high tolerance
towards physical abrasions and cost effectiveness (Roberts et al., 2019). AuNPs were selected
as the signal amplifiers due to its high conductivity, biocompatibility, stability, and size related
electronic properties (Talan et al., 2018). AuNPs were drop casted onto the FTO electrode and
nCovid-19 Ab was immobilized to detect the presence of nCovid-19 spike Ag. All
immobilization steps were characterised using physicochemical methods such as UV-Vis
Spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Dynamic light scattering
spectroscopy (DLS), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), Cyclic Voltammetry
(CV), Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). In case of eCovSens, nCovid-19 Ab was
immobilized onto SPCE for detection. The LOD of nCovid-19 Ag was determined at 10 fM
(in-house built device) which was in close proximity with potentiostat with the range of
concentrations from 1 fM to 1 μM in standard buffer. We concluded that the eCovSens is
ultrasensitive, highly specific, provides rapid results within 10-30 s, requires only 20 μL sample
volume, and can be carried to the bedside and is stable upto one month if compared with
potentiostat that requires a laboratory set up and 100 μl sample volume. Furthermore, eCovSens
device can be customised to any target analyte, and can also have other future applications for
detection of various other ailments.
2. Materials and Methods:
2.1. Reagents and Apparatus
Sodium dihydrogen phosphate-1-hydrate (Na2HPO4.H2O) was acquired from Merck (Mumbai,
India). Potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH2PO4), sodium carbonate anhydrous
(Na2CO3), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate
(C6H5Na3O7.2H2O), potassium ferrocynaide (K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O) and potassium ferricyanide
(C6N6FeK3) were procured from Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL, India). Potassium chloride
(KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were obtained from CDH (New Delhi, India). Carbon coated
copper TEM grids were acquired from Ted Pella Inc. (Redding, Canada). The FTO electrodes
and gold(III) chloride (Au2Cl6) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (India) while the SPCE
from Zensor (Texas, USA). nCovid-19 Ag (Spike S1 protein) and nCovid-19 Ab were procured
from ProSci (California, USA). Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) and Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) Ag were obtained from The Native Antigen
Company (Oxford, UK). Aurdino software has been used in the in-house built device and the
hardware include a printed Circuit Board (PCB), the encoder and decoder, adapter, bluetooth
module, Op amplifier, resistors, and transistors. All chemicals, solvents and reagents used were
of high quality analytical grade unless stated otherwise and all solutions were prepared in
double distilled water.

JEOL-JEM 2010 operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The CV and DPV
measurements were performed with Metrohm Autolab-PGSTAT-101 (Chennai, India) driven
by Nova 2.1 software. Connecting of wires in the in-house built device were done using a
soldering device and a Mastech Group multimeter was used to check the proper flow of current
in the circuit during fabrication. All experiments were performed at room temperature (RT) (25
˚C) unless stated otherwise.
2.3. Synthesis of AuNPs and its labelling with nCovid-19 Ab
AuNPs were synthesized using Turkevich (Turkevich et al., 1951) and Frens (Frens, 1973)
heat-reflux citrate reduction method. For the synthesis of AuNPs, gold chloride (0.01 mL, 10%)
was added to milli-Q water and heated until the mixture began to boil. 1 mL of 1 % sodium
citrate tribasic was immediately added to the boiling solution, that resulted in gradual change
in the colour from yellow to dark blue and finally to wine red. The colloidal solution cooled
and stored at 4 °C until further use. For labelling of nCovid-19 Ab with AuNPs, 90 μg nCovid19 Ab was added drop wise to 1 mL of AuNPs solution in Phosphate Buffer (PB) (20 mM, pH
7.5). The AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab mix was allowed to react overnight (O/N) at 4 °C and
centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any excess unbound Ab. The
AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab conjugate was resuspended in PB (20 mM, pH 7.5) for further studies.
2.4. Characterisation of AuNPs and AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
Various physicochemical methods were used to confirm the labelling of nCovid-19 Ab with
AuNPs. UV-Vis spectra were observed in the range of 200-800 nm with a step of 0.1 nm and
scanning speed of 20 nm/s for AuNPs and AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab conjugate. The hydrodynamic
diameter and zeta potential of both the AuNPs and AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab conjugate were
obtained from the DLS at 200 kHz for photon counting, scattering angle 90 °C, and temperature
24 ± 2 °C. The hydrodynamic diameter calculated based on Stokes–Einstein equation as water
was considered as the continuous phase (water viscosity = 0.911–0.852 mPa/s, diffusion
coefficient of AuNPs = 6.89 × 10−9 to 5.30 × 10−8 cm2/s) (Talan et al., 2018). FT-IR spectra
were taken in the range of 1000-4000 cm-1 to determine the changes in bonds/functional groups.
Morphology and size were determined by drop casting the AuNPs and AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
samples on carbon coated copper TEM grids.
2.5. Fabrication of FTO electrode with AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
The FTO (3 cm x 5 cm) electrode was made up of glass coated with fluorine doped tin oxide.
200 μl of AuNPs were drop casted on the surface of FTO electrode and completely dried for
48 h at 4 °C. 40 μl of nCovid-19 Ab (1 μg/mL) was immobilised on different FTO/AuNPs
electrode further for 24 h at 4 °C.
2.6. Characterisation, optimisation, and testing of FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab with nCovid19 Ag
Electrochemical characterisation of the FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab was done by using FTO as
a working electrode, and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. This was done by sweeping the
potential from −0.001 kV to 0.001 kV in K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1) solution containing
100 mM KCl. In order to obtain maximum sensing signal, various factors such as Ab

concentration, temperature, pH, and response time, were optimised by comparing CV/DPV.
The nCovid-19 Ag concentration was prepared in the range of 1 fM to 1 μM (in 1X PBS, pH
7.4) and LOD was determined. The application of the fabricated FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
sensor was also evaluated for its degree of sensitivity in saliva samples spiked with nCovid-19
Ag (120 fM). Furthermore, the stability and repeatability of the fabricated FTO/AuNPs/
nCovid-19 Ab was also evaluated over a period of 4 weeks. The specificity was determined by
analyzing cross-reactivity against other viral Ag including HIV, JEV, and AIV.
2.7. Fabrication of the novel in-house built electrochemical device
The designed in-house electrochemical device can be called an embedded system that is a
combination of elements, software package, and other mechanical/distinct components
designed to perform a selected operation. Each embedded system consists of a custom-made
hardware designed around a central processing unit (CPU) and this hardware additionally
contains memory chips onto which the software package is loaded. The software package
residing on the microchip is additionally known as the computer code. The embedded system
design is often diagrammatical as a stratified design. The building blocks of the embedded
system include a central processing unit (CPU), pair of memory storages (read-only memory
(ROM), and random access memory (RAM)), input devices, output devices, communication
interfaces, and application-specific electronic equipment.

Flowchart 1 showed the different components of the hardware design of the in-house device
embedded system where the CPU acts as the associate in nursing interface between input and
output devices. Additionally, it consists of RAM, and storage recollections that are able to store
temporary, and permanent information. Communication system acts as an associate in the
nursing interface between CPU, and different parts of the embedded system. Fabrication of the
device was carried out as follows: Using the free version of Aurdino integrated development
environment (IDE), we designed the biosensor in two steps: (i) the circuit diagram using
PROTEUS design software as the stimulation tool, and (ii) the route of the wires, and layout
of the components on a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB). The components were surface-

mounted onto the PCB. The firmware of the microcontroller (RFduino) was written, using
EMBEDDED C programming. To load the firmware onto the microcontroller, a universal
serial bus (USB) was attached to the contact pads on the PCB, and connected the other end to
the terminals of a USB shield for Aurdino. The socket was created and connected with SPCE,
and a rechargeable to the contact pads.
2.8. Specificity and cross-reactivity studies of the fabricated in-house built device
Optimisation of all the parameters such as Ab concentration, buffer conditions were done
before carrying out the detection (data not shown). The SPCE electrode was inserted into the
device and change in voltage was measured in mV. For this, 0.02 µg of nCovid-19 Ab (20 μL)
was immobilized on the electrode via passive adsorption. Different concentrations of nCovid19 Ag were applied onto the electrode ranging from 1 fM to 1 µM to analyze the sensitivity of
the device. Cross-reactivity study was done using AIV Ag at similar concentrations as of
nCovid-19 Ag. The nCovid-19 Ag (90 fM) was spiked into saliva and monitored for its
sensitivity. The electrode was washed with PBS after each step, and values were noted
immediately (in 10 to 30 s) after addition of buffer/antibody/antigen. Furthermore, the stability
and repeatability of the designed sensor was evaluated on the same SPCE/nCovid-19 Ab
electrode over a period of 4 weeks at 7 day intervals.
3. Results and Discussion:
3.1. Design and principle of the fabricated FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab sensor
Scheme 1 elucidates the mechanism of sensing and fabrication of the developed FTO
immunosensor integrated with AuNPs and nCovid-19 Ab. AuNPs act as a catalyst and amplify
the electrochemical signal by enhancement of electrical conductivity. Presence of AuNPs
serves as a platform for the attachment of nCovid-19 Ab by electrostatic interactions or simple
physisorption. Addition of nCovid-19 Ag on the FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab modified
electrode led to change in electrical current. The major phenomenon that lies behind, is the
orientation and polarity of the protein molecules that plays a crucial role in electron transfer
from the electrode surface. The developed immunosensor effectively combined the beneficial
features of FTO electrode, AuNPs, and the highly specific immunological interaction between
nCovid-19 Ab and its nCovid-19 Ag, that enabled quick and effective response.

immobilised homogenous layer of AuNPs. Further, AuNPs are allowed to conjugate with
nCovid-19 Ab either by physisorption or electrostatic bonding; (B) The fabricated electrode

served as the working electrode in a 3 electrode system which consisted of a Ag/AgCl with KCl
reference electrode and platinum counter electrode, immersed in K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6]
(1:1) solution with 100 mM KCl that acts as the redox potential buffer. The CV and DPV
measurements were taken using a potentiostat. (C) The CV/DPV graph of each step of
fabrication for detection at different concentration of nCovid-19 Ag showed changes in current
that can be analysed to determine the LOD of fabricated FTO electrode.
3.2. Characterisation of AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab labelling
UV spectra (Fig.1.(A)) showed the characteristic peak of AuNPs at 520 nm due to its surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) properties whereas a red shift of 9 nm was observed at 529 nm when
AuNPs were labelled with nCovid-19 Ab that confirmed the immobilisation of Ab on the
surface of AuNPs via electrostatic interactions or physisorption mechanism. Three additional
peaks were observed in FT-IR spectra (Fig.1.(B)) after conjugation of Ab with AuNPs at 1290
cm-1 (C-O stretching) and 2564 cm-1(S-H bond) and a new peak at 2328 cm-1 (C-N bond)
confirmed the binding of AuNPs with nCovid-19 Ab. The change in hydrodynamic diameter
was also observed from 21 nm (bare AuNPs) to 30±5 nm (AuNPs-Ab) further reconfirmed the
conjugation of AuNPs with Ab (Fig.1.(C)) and the single and sharp peak showed that the
particles are monodispersed in the colloidal solution. This increase in hydrodynamic diameter
occurred due to binding of Ab with AuNPs. In Fig.1.(D), zeta potential was shifted from -42
mV (bare AuNPs) to -39 mV (AuNPs- nCovid-19 Ab) due to the insulating effect of the Ab
protein deposition layer around the AuNPs which confirmed the process of conjugation. The
size and morphological analysis of the AuNPs and AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab conjugate was done
by TEM as shown in Fig.1.(E)(i) & (ii) respectively. AuNPs were observed to be
monodispersed with an average size of 21±5 nm while in the case of AuNPs/Ab, a
proteinaceous layer can be seen deposited around the AuNPs verified the immobilisation of Ab
with AuNPs.

Fig.1. The labelling of nCovid-19 Ab with AuNPs: (A) The characteristic peak of bare AuNPs
observed at 520 nm due to SPR whereas the peak broadened and showed a red shift to 529 nm
when AuNPs labelled with Ab; (B) FTIR spectrum, three additional peaks observed after

3.3. Optimisation of fabricated FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
CV was carried out for optimisation of electrochemical parameters of FTO, FTO/AuNPs,
FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab and FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab/Ag modified electrode as shown
in Fig.2.(A). An increase in the current was observed between the bare FTO electrode and the
FTO/AuNPs modified electrode possibly due to high conductivity of the AuNPs which
accelerates the electron transfer on the surface of electrode (Tey et al., 2010). Additionally,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059204; this version posted May 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Fig.2. Electrochemical characterisation and optimisation of the fabricated FTO electrode in
the scanning potential range of −1.0 V to 1.0 V in 100 mM KCl, having 0.005 M
K4Fe(CN)6.H2O and 0.005 mM K3Fe(CN)6, at a scan rate of 100 mV/s: (A) CV spectra of bare
FTO, FTO/AuNPs, FTO/AuNPS/nCovid-19 Ab and FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab/Ag compared
and it was observed that with the addition of each new biomolecule, the current output
increased; (B) DPV of different concentrations of nCovid-19 Ab (0.25 μg/mL, 0.5 μg/mL, 1.0
μg/mL, 1.5 μg/mL) were taken and highest current output was observed in 1.0 μg/mL nCovid19 Ab concentration; (C) CV spectra of different response time (a to f→5 s to 30 s) were
superimposed and at 20 s and beyond the current output remained stabl; (D) CV at three
different temperatures (a. 4 ˚C, b. RT, c. 37 ˚C) showed negligible change in current; (E) CV
at different pH (a. 4, b. 7.4, c. 8, d. 12) where pH 7.4 and 8.0 inferred the highest current.

high surface area of AuNPs allowed the binding of nCovid-19 Ab that was clearly indicated by
increase in the redox peak for ferro/ferricyanide probe. This phenomenon could be explained
due to increased permeation of ferro/ferricyanide probe that interacts with AuNPs and
enhanced the conductivity. The increased current could be seen further when nCovid-19 Ag
was applied on FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab modified electrode. The analytical performance of
the modified FTO/AuNPs electrode was optimized for nCovid-19 Ab where different
concentrations of Ab (0.25 μg/mL, 0.5 μg/mL, 1.0 μg/mL, 1.5 μg/mL) were analysed and
highest current output was observed in 1.0 μg/mL Ab concentration (Fig.2.(B)), that was
further used in case of all electrochemical studies. The response time was evaluated from 5 s,
10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 25 s, 30 s and maximum peak current was observed at 25 s due to saturation of
binding sites in nCovid-19 Ab with its spike Ag (Fig.2.(C)). CV data of the current output of
the electrode at three different temperatures (4 ˚C, RT, 37 ˚C) (Fig.2.(D)) showed no effect of
temperature on the functioning of the fabricated electrode hence all experiments were carried
out at RT. Also, the optimum pH required to obtain maximum current signal of FTO electrode
was determined by comparing CV at different pH range (4, 7.4, 8 and 12) and the maximum
signal was observed at pH 7.4 as well as 8.0 (Fig.2.(E)). Therefore, buffer with pH 7.4 was
used as the optimum pH for further detection experimentation.

3.4. Analytical performance of the fabricated FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
Differential pulse voltammetry was used for the determination of nCovid-19 spike Ag
concentration as shown in Fig.3.(A). The linear regression equation for DPV was explained in
(Fig.3.(A)). For diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the Intercept and slope was 0.002039 ±
6.396 e-005 and 0.0001784 ± 1.066 e-005 with equation I = 0.0001784× + 0.002039 (I (μA)) and
r2 = 0.9722; where, I = peak current; c = concentration of nCovid-19 Ag. Different
concentrations of nCovid-19 Ag ranging from 1 fM to 1 μM (standard buffer) were tested on
the FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab modified electrode and the standard calibration curve was
plotted based on DPV (Fig.3.(B)) with LOD as 10 fM for nCovid-19 Ag. Cross reactivity
studies were done to test non-specific binding of other viral Ag as shown in

Fig.3.(C) that showed increased signal current with nCovid-19 Ag whereas no signal was
observed with HIV, JEV or AIV Ag when all Ag concentrations were kept constant at 10 fM.
This showed the high specificity of the nCovid-19 Ab towards nCovid-19 Ag. Furthermore,
repeatability and stability parameters were also evaluated for FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab
fabricated electrode. In this case, readings of saliva samples spiked with nCovid-19 Ag were
taken on a single modified electrode (Fig.3.(D)) with 120 fM concentration of nCovid-19 Ag.
The results indicated that the fabricated electrodes can be used upto 3 times without major
changes in peak current and could detect upto 120 fM. The stability of the FTO/AuNPs/nCovid19 Ab fabricated electrode was observed at 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day of its fabrication and kept
at 4 °C. In Fig.3.(E) the modified FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab electrode provide stable readings
over a period of three weeks i.e. 21 days when tested over a period one month that shows the
electrode can be stored at 4 °C upto 21 days and can be used for testing of nCovid-19 samples
in laboratory set up for upto 3 weeks without any compromise in results.

3.5. Proof of principle of developed in-house novel electrochemical device eCovSens
The in-house built eCovSens device detects changes in the voltage by making use of an SPCE
electrode that operates on the principle of signal transduction (Fig.4.(A)). The components of
the modified biosensor include a bio-recognition element (nCovid-19 Ab), a transducer
(carbon) and an electronic system composed of a display, processor and amplifier (in-house
electrochemical instrument). The bio-recognition element, essentially a bio receptor, is allowed
to interact with a specific analyte (nCovid-19 Ag) for detection. The Ag-Ab interactions
interact with the transducer and provide a voltage signal as an output (Fig.4.(B)). The intensity
of the signal output is proportional to the concentration of the analyte (nCovid-19 Ag). The
signal is then amplified and processed by the electronic system and the output is converted
from analogue to digital readings which are displayed on the device screen or mobile/computer
if connected via bluetooth through an application which is possible due to the fabricated circuit
(Fig.4.(C)).

electrochemical device depicting various components and the connections.
3.6. Analytical performance of eCovSens
Analytical performance of the device was observed by immobilising nCovid-19 Ab at 1 μg/mL
on SPCE electrode. Different concentrations of nCovid-19 Ag were prepared from 1 fM to 1
μΜ in 1x PBS, pH 7.4 and applied directly on the electrode. Change in voltage (in mV) was
observed, wherein maximum signal was obtained at 100 nM concentration of nCovid-19 Ag
and further increase in concentration (1 µM) did not alter the voltage signal. The device could
read the output voltage within a rapid time of 1 min and detected upto 10 fM sensitivity
(Fig.5.(A)), which is in close agreement with the commercially available potentiostat
(Fig.3.(A)). No cross reactivity studies was observed with different concentrations of AIV Ag
(Fig.5.(B)) which proved that the developed device is highly specific towards nCovid-19 Ag
detection. Fig.5.(C) showed the change in voltage from 540 mV (control-normal saliva) to 638
mV (test-spiked nCovid-19 Ag (LOD- 90 fM) in saliva) on fabricated SPCE/nCovid-19 Ab
electrode. Fig.5.(D) shows the SPCE/nCovid-19 Ab electrodes were found to be stable with no
change in voltage upto 4 weeks when tested with nCovid-19 Ag. Table 1 shows the currently
in-use diagnostic techniques available for nCovid-19 detection which include molecular
assays, immunoassays, and CT.

4. Conclusions:
In the proposed work, we have successfully developed a novel in-house built electrochemical
device eCovSens that can be used to detect changes in electrochemical signals upon Ag-Ab

interaction on SPCE/nCovid-19 Ab modified electrode. The developed technology can be used
to detect the global pandemic causing novel coronavirus nCovid-19 with LOD upto 10 fM
within 10-30 s. We have also compared our findings with a potentiostat using an
FTO/AuNPs/nCovid-19 Ab modified electrode with LOD upto 10 fM and found that our
eCovSens device is equally sensitive in both buffer samples as well as spiked saliva samples
along with no cross reactivity with other viral Ag, rapid detection, portable, and storage
stability upto 4 weeks with no change in voltage. The device can further be potentially used
directly on clinical samples for nCovid-19 detection. Moreover, unlike a potentiostat, this
device is portable since it can be battery operated as it uses very less voltage (1.3-3V), and can
be used for bedside/on-site PoC diagnostics. The developed device is very cheap and cost
effective as compared with the commercial potentiostat which is an expensive instrument that
requires a laboratory set up. The in-house built novel electrochemical device shows great future
potential for detection of various other diseases as the sensor can easily be customised.
