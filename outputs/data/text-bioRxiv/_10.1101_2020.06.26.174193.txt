ABSTRACT
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, like many
other viruses, uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) to enable synthesis of multiple proteins from its compact genome.
In independent analyses, we evaluated the PRF regions of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in GenBank and from the Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data for variations. Of the 5,156 and 27,153 sequences analyzed, respectively, the PRF regions
were identical in 95.7% and 97.2% of isolates. The most common change from the reference sequence was from C to U at position
13,536, which lies in the three-stemmed pseudoknot known to stimulate frameshifting. With the conversion of the G13493-C13536
Watson-Crick pair to G-U, the SARS-CoV-2 PRF closely resembles its counterpart in the Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus. The occurrence of this change increased from 0.5 to 3% during the period of March to May 2020.

In many viruses, programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF)
is necessary for the expression of essential viral proteins. For
instance, a -1 frameshift results in production of the HIV
polyprotein Gag-Pol, which is necessary for viral
replication1,2. Coronaviruses also depend on -1 PRF to
express a polyprotein that encodes the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase3,4. In SARS-CoV-2, the polymerase is an
antiviral drug target5,6. The 30-kb positive-sense, singlestranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 has an organization
similar to that of other members of genus Betacorona virus7.
The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 encodes 14 open
reading frames (ORFs) including the very long (more than
20 kb) ORF1a/b. This ORF encodes a polyprotein processed
into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16). ORFs 1a and 1b
are not in the same frame, and expression of proteins from
ORF1b requires the ribosome to slip backwards in the 5’
direction by one nucleotide such that the translation proceeds
in a new reading frame8,9.
In the PRF events characterized, frameshifting is dependent
on three mRNA elements: a heptameric slippery sequence
where the frameshift occurs, a cis-acting stimulatory RNA
structure located downstream of the slippery sequence, and a
linker of a few nucleotides separating these two elements9–11.
This mRNA stimulating structure is either a pseudoknot8,9 or
a hairpin12–15.
Among the cis-acting structures that induce -1 PRF, the
hairpin-type (H-type) pseudoknot16 is observed very
frequently. These pseudoknots usually fold as two doublestranded helices (stems 1 and 2) separated by two or three
single-stranded connecting loops17. Detailed structural
analyses of frameshifting pseudoknots from the beet western
yellow virus, the sugarcane yellow leaf virus, and the simian
retrovirus type-1 revealed how nucleotides from the
connecting loop 2 have extensive contacts with the minor
groove of stem 118–20. In the SARS-CoV PRF region, a third

internal stem-loop element contributes to the formation of a
complex three-stemmed pseudoknot structure21–23.
Protein or RNA trans-acting factors can enhance or repress
PRF efficiency. MicroRNAs bind and stabilize the
pseudoknot of the human CCR5 mRNA to increase -1 PRF
efficiency24. The protein 2A from the encephalomyocarditis
virus binds to the stimulatory RNA signal and as a
consequence increases -1 PRF efficiency in the viral ORF25.
Recently, the interferon-stimulated gene product Shiftless
has been shown to be a host factor that inhibits the -1 PRF of
HIV-126. RNA elements that act in cis can also repress PRF.
An attenuator RNA hairpin located immediately upstream of
the slippery sequence represses -1 PRF in SARS-CoV27,28.
Changes in the sequence of the SARS-CoV pseudoknot
affect frameshifting efficiency with drastic consequences on
viral propagation, making the pseudoknot a potential drug
target for antiviral treatment29,30. In silico screening
identified a small ligand 2-{[4-(2-methylthiazol-4-ylmethyl)[1,4]diazepane-1 carbonyl]amino}benzoic acid ethyl ester
(MTDB) that binds the SARS-CoV pseudoknot. This ligand
inhibits -1 PRF both in cell-free and cell-based assays31. A
mechanical unfolding investigation of the pseudoknot in
presence of the ligand suggests that rather than increasing
pseudoknot stability the ligand reduces conformational
plasticity of the pseudoknot leading to -1 PRF inhibition32.
As the structure of the three-stemmed pseudoknot is
conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-233, it is of interest
to evaluate how this sequence has evolved during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how the -1 PRF
sequence might change during adaptation to humans34 is
important for antiviral therapy development as drugs should
target conserved regions of the RNA to avoid emergence of
resistance. In addition, host RNA dependent editing of
SARS-CoV-2 genome may have important consequences on
the fate of the virus and the patient35.

233. In SARS-CoV-2, position 13533 is A, and in SARS-CoV
this position is C (Figure 4). None of the SARS-CoV-2
strains analyzed had C at this position (Figure 3).

We independently analyzed 5,156 SARS-CoV-2 sequences
available in GenBank and 27,153 sequences available in
GISAID for sequence variation in the -1 PRF region. We
found that the sequence has remained largely unchanged
during the pandemic, with observed changes maintaining the
overall architecture of the -1 PRF signals. In the small
percentage of in GenBank and GISAID entries with changes
in the PRF region relative to the reference sequence, we
identified a recurrent C to U change at position 13,536. This
position lies in the functional center of the three-stemmed
pseudoknot. Interestingly, the conversion of the G13493-C13536
Watson-Crick pair into a wobble G-U pair results in a
pseudoknot structure that closely resembles its counterpart in
the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV).

RESULTS
Comparative analysis of -1 PRF SARS-CoV-2 sequences
obtained from GenBank and GISAID reveals a frequent
change. We initially assessed the frequency of mutations in
-1 frameshift signal region of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1) by
analyzing sequences that were available in GenBank as of
June 6, 2020. Only sequences longer than 29 kb were
analyzed. Of the 5,156 sequences, 4,947 had -1 PRF signal
identical to that of the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence
(NC_045512.2)7. The alignment of the sequences that did
not contain an identical -1 PRF signal showed that within the
pseudoknot region, position 13536 was most variable; it was
changed from C in the reference strain to U in most cases
(Supplementary Figure 1). This change was found in 12
isolates (0.23% frequency) from various origins. We refer to
the C13536-to-U change as a type 1 mutation.
We next extended this analysis to the larger collection of
sequence
data
available
from
GISAID
(https://www.epicov.org)36,37. Data were downloaded using
“complete”, “high coverage only”, and “low coverage
excluded” filtering functions. In this ensemble of 27,153
entries, conservation of the -1 PRF signal of reference strain
was found for 26,405 strains, which corresponds to 97.2%
(Figure 2). This agreed with the observation that any two
genomes contain pairwise differences of 9.6 single
nucleotide polymorphisms on average when considering the
85-nucleotide length of the -1 PRF signal34. The alignment of
748 sequences that did not have PRF sequence identical to
that of the reference sequence revealed 418 entries with
fewer than 5 ambiguous nucleotides, 93.3% of these have a
single nucleotide mutation in the PRF signal. In 281 entries
(1% of all sequences analyzed), the PRF region sequence
was identical to that of the type 1 mutant (Figure 2). A
nucleotide variation plot clearly shows that the variation is
concentrated at position 13536 (Figure 3).
There is only one nucleotide difference in the three-stemmed
pseudoknot structure between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

indicated by bar color. Positions refer to that of the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence.

No consistent changes are observed in the 5’ attenuator
stem-loop. In SARS-CoV, a short attenuator stem-loop was
identified just upstream of the slippery sequence27,28. A
comparative sequence analysis showed that in SARS-CoV-2,
this stem-loop is not as highly conserved as the threestemmed pseudoknot sequence33 (Figure 4). In SARS-CoV,
the hairpin is capped by a UNCG tetraloop38,39 whereas it is
an AGNN tetraloop in SARS-CoV-240,41 (Figure 1). In
SARS-CoVs, the stem consists of 8 to 10 base pairs. In the
35-nucleotide attenuator region of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates
from the GenBank dataset, only 2.6% of the strains had
attenuator hairpin sequences that differed from that of the
Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Supplementary Figure 2). Most of these
strains had ambiguities in this region (more than 5
ambiguous bases in the 35-nucleotide region analyzed). Only
21 entries that had no ambiguities had mutations in the
attenuator stem-loop, and none of the mutations were
observed more than once. Therefore, in this hairpin, we did
not identify a specific nucleotide with a strong frequency of
change.

reference sequence, the Watson-Crick pair G13493-C13536 lies
in the vicinity of the junction between stems 1 and 2 and
loop 3. The type 1 mutation likely results in the formation of
a non-canonical G-U pair in the upper part of stem 2. When
we compared the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot structure with
that of related coronaviruses, we found that there is a G-U
pair at the same position in the MERS-CoV pseudoknot
(Figure 4). This G-U pair is flanked by two structural
elements identified as important for -1 PRF efficiency in
SARS-CoV: the first Watson-Crick base pair of stem 2
(U13424-A13465 in SARS-CoV and A13462-U13503 in MERSCoV) and a bulged adenosine residue (A13467 and A13505,
respectively)22. Consequently, the type 1 change is located in
the functional center of the -1 PRF pseudoknot and the C to
U substitution at position 13,536 results in interesting
similarities with MERS-CoV.
The type 1 change may have resulted from RNA editing.
The deamination of cytosine into uracil is mediated by the
cytidine deaminase APOBEC (Apolipoprotein B mRNA
Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like) family of proteins42,43.
APOBECs are responsible for widespread C-to-U RNA
editing of cellular transcripts. Different family members act
in different tissues and cell types, and the enzyme
APOBEC3A has activity in pro-inflammatory macrophages
and in monocytes exposed to hypoxia and/or interferons44.
APOBEC1 is expressed in the liver, and a shorter isoform
that results from mRNA editing is detected in the small
intestine. APOBECs display different sequence requirements
around the target C. In SARS-CoV-2, bases flanking the
C13536 to U mutation site match the consensus sequence of

Occurrence of type 1 changes increased over time.
GISAID allows rapid data sharing, and changes in sequence
over the time can be monitored. There was a considerable
increase in the frequency of the type 1 change over time
(Figure 5). The frequency increased 6 fold from 0.5% in
March 2020 to 3% in May 2020.
The type 1 mutation alters the pseudoknot functional
center. In the secondary structure of the Wuhan-Hu-1

APOBEC1 (A/U-C-A/U) (Figure 4)42,45. A second RNA
element important for editing is an 11-nucleotide mooring
sequence downstream of the target C. In SARS-CoV-2, the
similarity with the consensus mooring sequence of
APOBEC1 is only partial. The spacer between the C13536 and
the mooring sequence is 8 nucleotides long, within the 2- to

8-nucleotide length commonly found46. Thus, it is possible
that the C13536 to U change that we identified resulted from
an RNA editing event.

DISCUSSION
3.5

As in all sequenced coronaviruses, a -1 frameshift is
necessary for expression of SARS-CoV-2 early proteins such
as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Ribosomal
frameshifting is stimulated by a three-stemmed RNA
pseudoknot. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues,
SARS-CoV-2 will likely evolve as it adapts to its human
host34. Here we focused on the sequence variability of the -1
PRF signals by analysis of 5,156 SARS-CoV-2 sequences
that were available in the GenBank as of June 6, 2020 and
27,153 entries from GISAID available as of June 7, 2020.
We found that the 85-nucleotide -1 PRF region is highly
conserved with 95.7% and 97.2% of isolates, respectively,
identical in this region to the reference sequence, WuhanHu-1 (NC_045512.2). Among the isolates with differences
from the reference sequence in the -1 PRF region, there is a
recurrent change. This change, which we refer to as a type 1
mutation, corresponds to substitution of C with U in stem 2

of the pseudoknot. SARS-CoV-2 encodes a 3’-to-5’
exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN)
which ensures high-fidelity replication. When nsp14-ExoN is
inactivated, the spectrum of mutations introduced by the
Nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase becomes
apparent49. As the C-to-U transition is not a frequent change
introduced by the polymerase, it is possible that it originates
from RNA editing by a cytosine deaminase35,42,43.
Biophysical single-molecule assays and kinetics studies on
ensembles revealed how the interplay between the
conformational plasticity of RNA-inducing frameshifting
structures and the dynamics of the ribosome play a critical
role in the -1 PRF mechanism50–54. Interestingly, the type 1
change results in the substitution of a G-C Watson-Crick pair
in the functional core of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot with a
wobble G-U pair. This likely alters the conformational
plasticity of the pseudoknot with possible functional
consequences as the dynamics of this region of the RNA are
critical for frameshifting efficiency22.
There is a lack of clinically effective antiviral drugs for
treatment of highly pathogenic coronaviruses55. Since
frameshifts are essential, the PRF region is a target for drug
development32,33. The small molecule MTDB binds to the
SARS-CoV
pseudoknot
and
inhibits
ribosomal
frameshifting31. Since the functional center of SARS-CoV
pseudoknot was identified as the drug binding site, by
analogy the same regions in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV
might as well form sites that could be bound by small
molecules to inhibit viral replication.
Our analysis showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the sequence of the stimulator pseudoknot has been highly
conserved. However, it is interesting to note that the
tolerated type 1 change modifies the functional center of the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot to closely resemble its counterpart
in MERS-CoV.

GenBank sequence analysis. A full acknowledgements table
of the laboratories where the clinical specimens and/or virus
isolates were obtained and laboratories where data have been
generated was obtained from the GISAID website and is
included as Supplementary Table 1.

METHODS
Sequence analysis. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2
isolates were downloaded from the SARS-CoV-2 data hub of
the NCBI Virus website56. All the sequences longer than
29,000 bases that were released by June 6, 2020 were
analyzed (5,156 sequences). Sequences that did not contain a

strain
(5’TTTAAACGGGTTTGCGGTGTAAGTGCAGCCCGTCTT

ATACAGGGCTTTTG-3’)7,33 were selected. From the
selected sequences, a 2,500-base region (11,500 to 14,000
bases from the 5’ end) containing the 85 nucleotides of the -1
PRF region of ORF1a/b were extracted and aligned using
ClustalX software57. For attenuator hairpin, the same
analysis was performed using the 35 nucleotides including
this
hairpin-forming
sequence:
(5’CCCATGCTTCAGTCAGCTGATGCACAATCGTTTTT3’).
For the analysis of data from GISAID, sequences available
as of June 7, 2020 were downloaded from GISAID Initiative
EpiCoV platform using “complete”, “high coverage only”,
and “low coverage excluded” filtering functions. Sequences
derived from animals (bat and pangolin) were excluded. A
total of 27,153 sequences were analyzed as described for the
