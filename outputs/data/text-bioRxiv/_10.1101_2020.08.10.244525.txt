Abstract. The SARS coronavirus 2 main protease 3CLpro tailor cuts various essential virus
proteins out of long poly-protein translated from the virus RNA. If the 3CLpro is inhibited, the
functional virus proteins cannot form and the virus cannot replicate and assemble. Any compound
that inhibits the 3CLpro is therefore a potential drug to end the pandemic. Here we show that the
diffraction power of 3CLpro crystals is effectively destroyed by Ebselen. It appears that Ebselen
may be a widely available, relatively cost effective way to eliminate the SARS coronavirus 2.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the last half year, a large body of literature became available
to understand and combat the SARS coronavirus-2 (CoV-2). Due to its importance for virus protein
maturation the SARS CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also called 3CLpro, became a major drug
target. In its functional form the 3CLpro is a homo dimer with His/Cys dyads (His-41 and Cys145) in the active centers1. The structure of the CoV-2 3CLpro has been solved recently (Fig. 1)
guided by high similarity to other coronavirus 3CLpros 1. A large number (>500) of SARS CoV-2
3CLpro structures were recently deposited in the protein data bank mainly following a fragment
screening study at the synchrotron Diamond near Oxford, England. Binding of fragments not only
to the active center was observed. They all constitute a database of potential drugs to target the
3CLpro. Apart from the fragments, the most promising compounds are the α-ketoamides (Fig. 1)
which bind tightly to the 3CLpro1-3. As they are complicated to synthesize they carry a hefty price

tag (companies ask for 14,000 dollars/g as recently inquired by one of the authors). A less
expensive, but also less known compound that binds to the 3CLpro is Ebselen 4. Ebselen is a
selenium compound (Scheme 1) currently tested for a number of diseases such as bipolar disorder
and hearing loss4. Selenium is an essential metal, but toxic in higher doses. Ebselen has been shown
to bind strongly to the CoV-2 3CLpro4, but the structure of the complex is unknown. Here we
show what happens when Ebselen is added to 3CLpro crystals.

Expression. The CoV-2 3CLpro sequence was
synthetized (GenScript) for optimized expression in E.
coli according to sequence information published
previously1. In short, the N-terminus of 3CLpro is fused
to glutathione-S-transferase (GST). It further has a 6-His
tag at the c-terminus. The N-terminal GST will be
autocatalytically cleaved off after expression due to an
engineered 3CLpro cleavage sequence. The His tag can
cleaved off by a PreCission Protease. Overexpression
and protein purification protocols were modified from
previous reports. E. coli were grown to 0.8 OD600 at 37o
in terrific broth. Expression was induced by 1 mmol/L IPTG at 25o C. After 3 h of expression, the
culture was induced a second time (1 mmol/L IPTG), and shaken overnight at 20 o C. The yield is
about 80 mg for a 6 L culture. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20mM Tris Base, 150
mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.8.). After lysis of the bacterial cells, debris was centrifuged at 50,000 g for 1
hour. The lysate was let stand at room temperature for at least 3 h (overnight is also possible).
After this, the lysate was pumped through a column containing 15 mL of Talon Cobalt resin
(TAKARA). The resin was washed without using imidazole using a wash cycle consisting of low

pH 7.8), high salt (20 mmol/L Tris Base, 1
mol/L NaCl, pH 7.8) and low salt (as above)
solutions (about 20 column volumes each).
After the wash cycle was completed, the
column was let stand for an additional 2 h at
room temperature followed by another wash
cycle. The final product was eluted by 300
mmol/L imidazole, dialyzed immediately in
20 mmol/L Tris base, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1
mmol/L dithiotreitol (DTT), pH 7.8, and
concentrated to 20 mg/mL. Note, the cterminal 6-His tag was not cleaved off. Due to
this one step purification protocol, only 24 h
are required from cell lysis to the pure 3CLpro
product. The product is within 1.7 Da of the
theoretical molecular weight as determined by
mass spectroscopy.

Crystallization. The concentrated 3CLpro
(with the His-tag left on) was diluted to 4
mg/mL. 100 μL of the diluted 3CLpro was
mixed (1:1) in batch mode with the same
amount of 25 % PEG 3350, Bis-Tris 100
mmol/L, pH 6.5. A few days later, nicely
shaped crystals with dimensions of about 200
x 30 x 30 μm3 were appearing. Crystals were
soaked in mother liquor by adding Ebselen in
powder form as Ebselen is not very soluble in
water. Enough Ebselen that would otherwise
produce a 50 mmol/L solution was added.
After 2 days of soaking, the crystals

82

completely maintained their morphology (Fig. 2b).

Data Collection and Structure determination. The crystals were mounted in Mitegen microloops
(30 - 50 μm) and directly frozen in pucks suspended in liquid nitrogen for automated (robotic) data
collection. The dewar with the pucks were driven to the Advanced Photon Source for robotic data
collection at Sector-19 (Structural Biology Center, SBC, beamline 19-ID-D). Data collection was
fully remote due to restriction of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of
diffraction patterns collected from untreated crystals (Fig. 2a), and crystals treated with the Ebselen
(Fig. 2b). As the untreated crystals diffracted beyond 2 Å, the treated crystals did not show any
Bragg reflections whatsoever, even at lowest resolution. They are completely amorphous, despite
the nice crystal-like shape. Accordingly, the structure of only the untreated 3CLpro can be solved.
A dataset to 2.2 Å was collected (0.5o rotation and 0.3 s exposure per detector readout for a total

of 180o). Data was processed with HKL30005. Data statistics in shown in Tab. 1. Initially the
spacegroup was found to be C2 (monoclinic centered). It was further determined by the CCP4
program6 pointless that spacegroup I2 (monoclinic body centered) is more suitable, in accordance
with published results7. The 3CLpro structure with pdb access code 6WQF7 was used as initial
model. Molecular replacement was not necessary. The model fits immediately and can be used for
refinement. Refinement was done using refmac8 (version 5.8.0238). The structure is shown in Fig.
3. Its mean square deviation from model 6WQF is about 0.4 Å with 0.5 Å standard deviation. This
means that the 3CLpro cryo structure with the His-tag and the room temperature structure are
identical within the resolution limit. The structure of the His-tag could not be determined. There
is, however, a large crystal cavity near the C-terminus that might accommodate (a very disordered)
6 histidine structure.

Results and Discussion. A very important result is that c-terminal PreCission His-tag cleavage is
not required to obtain 3CLpro crystals. This speeds up purification to the extent that now gram
sized 3CLpro preparations can be obtained in a relatively short period of time. This is a prerequisite
for mix-and-inject approaches at free electron lasers with gas-dynamic-virtual-nozzle type mixing
injectors9,10. At XFELs low concentrations of Ebselen can be mixed with the crystalline slurry
which is quickly injected into the X-ray beam. There is hope that crystal decomposition is slower
than the delay between mixing and injection. Then, the structure of the Ebselen-3CLpro complex
may be determined. In addition, microcrystals also tend to be unusually flexible and may survive
large unit cell changes11, which might make these experiments even more conceivable.

Since Ebselen has this strong effect on 3CLpro crystals, it a clear indication for the tight affinity
of this compound to the 3CLpro. Binding of Ebselen to the catalytic dyad has been already
identified by mass-spectroscopy and published earlier4. However, also after the experiments
reported here, the 3CLpro-Ebselen structure remains elusive. As Ebselen is a potent drug (and it
is not too toxic even in higher concentrations4), it has to be seen whether it can be used as an
effective weapon against the SARS CoV-2, and maybe all other pathogenic coronaviruses.
Whether it is suitable for a drug must be determined by physicians in a clinical setting perhaps in
combination with a SARS CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor such as remdesivir 12.
As crystallographers and structural biologists, though, we can deliver evidence for a potential
mechanism as shown recently by others for the α-ketoamides1,2 and also remdesivir12.

This manuscript is published without delay on BioRxiv to disseminate rapid methods for
preparation, purification and structure determination of 3CLpro to a wide community. In addition,
this manuscript intends to alert and increase awareness of the potential of Ebselen as a 3CLpro
inhibitor and its value perhaps in combination, as the authors are not aware that anything is
reported about it in the public press. The coordinates of the 100 K 3CLpro structure as determined
here are available on request.
