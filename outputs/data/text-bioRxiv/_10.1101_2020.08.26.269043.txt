Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly
and became a pandemic. Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective
against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed.
Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a
potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of
N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and
it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further
vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is
phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics
experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels
of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with
substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also
detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to
confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as
an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming
protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of the N protein may
provide useful insights for understanding the roles of glycosylation on viral pathogenesis and also
in vaccine design and development.
Introduction
In early December 2019 in Wuhan, China, an outbreak of disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly known as 2019 coronavirus
disease (COVID-19), spread rapidly and became a worldwide pandemic.1 According to the World
Health Organization (WHO) report, as of August 25, 2020, there have been 23.7 million confirmed

cases of COVID 19 globally, including over 814,000 deaths. Along with other medically advanced
countries like Italy, Spain, France and Germany, the United States of America (USA) is one of the
most affected countries in the world. To date, the USA alone has over 5.7 million confirmed cases
and over 176,000 deaths due to COVID-19.2 Therefore, a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is
urgently needed. Multiple preclinical studies have shown positive results, but despite the
continuous efforts by the scientific community towards a vaccine or a specific treatment, no
vaccine is currently available in USA or Europe that is proven effective and protective against
COVID-19.3-4
The coronavirus virion consists of a nucleocapsid that is surrounded by a lipid envelope
in which the membrane glycoprotein (M) and small transmembrane protein (E) are embedded.
Protrusions composed of trimeric glycoproteins (Spike protein, S) are anchored in the lipid
envelope and extend radially (Figure 1). These Spike proteins give the spherical viral particles an
appearance reminiscent of the solar corona, hence the name for this group of viruses. The S
protein is one of the most studied proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and has been under evaluation as a
vaccine target.4 The S protein is highly glycosylated and binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(hACE2) for entry into the cells. A number of studies have highlighted the importance of spike
protein glycans, which play a critical role in the mechanism of virus attachment to the hACE2
receptor. CD8+ T cells are known to detect and neutralize virus-infected cells by recognizing viral
protein-derived peptide epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)
proteins on the cell surface.5 Recently, however, a study involving SARS-CoV-2 patients identified
the majority of immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes from virus proteins other than the S protein,
and leading to the conclusion that more protein targets need to be included for new and more
effective vaccine design.6
The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most abundant proteins in the coronavirus.
Numerous copies of the N protein interact with RNA molecules during the viral life cycle. The N

protein, in conjunction with the membrane (M) protein, also contributes towards genome
condensation and packaging. The C-terminal interactions between the N and M proteins result in
specific genome encapsidation during the budding process of the viral particle. The N protein has
a molecular mass ranging from 45 to 60 kDa - possibly due to PTMs - and is highly basic in
nature.7 After sequence comparison of various strains, it is believed that the majority of N proteins
are composed of three highly conserved domains known as Domains 1, 2 and 3.7-8 Domains 1
and 2 are rich in arginine and lysine, a characteristic feature of several viral RNA-binding proteins.
The carboxy-terminal Domain 3 is short and contains a net negative charge due to multiple acidic
residues.7
Mapping studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, including the closely related
SARS coronavirus (retrospectively named SARS-CoV-1), which was the cause of an epidemic in
2003, have linked the RNA-binding function to a fragment of 55 amino acids located at the
N-terminal half that resides in Domain 1, and the dimerization function to its C-terminal half from
Domain 3 of the N protein. The linker region (LKR) is located in the middle of the protein sequence,
connects the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein and includes a Ser/Arg-rich (S/R-rich)
region.9 Studies have shown that the S/R-rich LKR contains multiple putative sites of
phosphorylation that may play a role in regulating N protein function and N-M protein
interactions.10-13 The N protein interacts with viral genome RNA to form long, flexible, helical
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. One of the structural models of coronaviruses (CoV)
proposes that numerous copies of the N protein are present in the form of a helical nucleocapsid
as well as in the internal spherical or icosahedral core.14 The internal core of CoV is composed of
N protein, RNA and the C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) of M protein.9 The M protein is the
main core shell component, and the CTD of M protein binds directly to the N protein through an
ionic interaction resulting in specific genome encapsidation in the budding viral particle. This way,
the N protein plays an important structural role in the CoV virion through a series of interactions

with the genomic RNA, M protein and other N proteins. Along with the structural roles, the N
protein is also associated with other processes such as mRNA transcription, replication, and host
cell modulation during viral infection. Interestingly, nucleocapsid proteins of MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-1 were found to antagonize interferons (INFs).15-17 Early studies investigating the
SARS-CoV-2 N protein show similar results in the suppression of interferon induction.18-19 INFs
are signaling molecules of the innate immune system of the host and have been identified as a
crucial component in the early phase of viral disease. In detail, type I and type III interferons serve
as the first important step of antiviral defense mechanisms that induce downstream antiviral
processes.20 Studies found that the antagonistic role of the N protein leads to a modulation of the
innate immune response of the host, weakening primary antiviral responses. An initial viral
evasion from innate immunity affects the course of the disease tremendously. 3, 21 The N protein
can also serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen
by priming protective immune responses. The recent mass spectrometry (MS) -based studies of
SARS-CoV-2 proteins from gargle solution samples and nasal swab samples of COVID-19
patients detected the presence of N protein peptides, making them a potential diagnostic
biomarker for COVID-19.22-23 The presence of N protein peptides in the gargle and
nasopharyngeal swabs could be used to develop a point of care high throughput test for fast
detection of SARS-CoV-2.

The authors demonstrated in these studies that SARS-CoV-2

peptidome detection through tandem mass spectrometry can be used as alternative
methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostics. The clinical study on gargle solution showed that
peptide

RPQGLPNNTASWFTALTQHGK61 from the N protein which comprises an N-

glycosylation site can only be detected on COVID-19 positive cases after the removal of Nglycosylations by PNGase F treatment.22 Whereas in the latter study, the authors argued that the
N protein peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR can be detected with intense signal within
short retention time on COVID-19 clinical samples.23 These recent findings on COVID-19 clinical

samples show the presence of N protein by the virus on the host and the potential as a diagnostic
biomarker at point of care.
A study of SARS-CoV-2 patients noted that 26 of 29 specific T cell epitopes came from
proteins other than the S protein.6 Importantly, out of these 29 immunodominant epitopes, 6
derived from the N protein. This makes the N protein a potential target for a new vaccine design
which would comprise more than one antigen to elicit a CD8+ T cell response against SARS-CoV2.6
Early studies, including recent review articles about the N protein, suggested that the N
protein is a phosphoprotein and does not bear glycans on its backbone.24 Glycan-detecting
software and amino acid sequence analysis have lately indicated the considerable likelihood of
the presence of N- and O-glycans. To our knowledge, however, glycan profiling and site-specific
information of N- and O-glycans in the N protein have not been described. To discover the PTMs
of N protein, we explored several high-resolution MS-based approaches, including glycomics,
glycoproteomics, and phosphoproteomics analyses. Our study has revealed new information
about the PTMs of N protein: We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not only a
phosphoprotein but also carries significant amounts of N- and O-glycosylation. MS experiments
to determine occupancy and site-specific microheterogeneity, sialic acid linkages, fucosylation
and investigation of bisecting GlcNAc of N-linked glycans were also conducted. In our study, we
detected mostly high-mannose and complex type glycans, as well as minor percentages of hybrid
N-glycans through the glycomics approach. These findings were confirmed in our glycoproteomic
investigation: We confirmed presence of N-glycosylation on two of five consensus sequons, which
were modified with mostly either high-mannose or complex type N-glycans. Along with N-linked
glycosylation, we also observed O-linked glycosylation on the N protein via glycomics and
glycoproteomics. Proteomic analysis for O-glycosylation and phosphorylation resulted in the
detection of 8 glycopeptides with 11 potential O-glycan sites and one phosphate modification site.

Results
Glycomics analysis of N- and O-glycans released from nucleocapsid protein.
We accomplished detailed structure characterization of the glycans of N protein that was
recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells using full MS and MSn experiments of the released and
permethylated glycans. The N protein was initially purified using SDS-PAGE for both N- and
O-glycomics experiments (Fig. S1). The N-glycans were released from the cut gel band by
treatment with PNGase F enzyme. The released N-glycans were extracted from the gel pieces
and were purified by C18 SPE. The gel pieces containing the remaining O-glycoprotein were
subjected to enzymatic digestion via trypsin and were extracted from gel bands with acetonitrilewater mixture. The obtained O-glycopeptides were used for the release of O-glycans by
Î²-elimination. Both N- and O-glycans were permethylated and analyzed by MALDI-MS and ESIMSn for the detailed structural characterization.
We observed mostly high-mannose type N-glycans (~73%), along with smaller amounts
of complex (~22%) and hybrid type (~5%) glycans. Sialylated and non-sialylated glycan structures
with multiple fucosylation were observed in lesser abundance (~7%) (Fig. 3A and Table S1). We
confirmed the structure of the permethylated N-glycans by ESI-MSn. Interestingly, we also
observed terminal GalNAc structures and lack of branching other than biantennary, and these are
discussed in the corresponding sections below.
The O-glycans detected on the N protein were Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, and Core 4 types;
however, Core 1 and Core 2 types were predominant, comprising 96% of total O-glycans (Figure
3B and Table S2). As shown in, Core 3 and Core 4 structures, which are formed by the activity of
the Core 3 GlcNAcT and Core 4 GlcNAcT enzymes,25 were relatively low (Figure 3B and Table
S2). The structural features such as branching, sialic acid linkage, position of fucose on O-glycans
were also confirmed by ESI-MSn.

Evaluation of the type of branching and presence of bisecting GlcNAc on the N protein Nglycans.
We evaluated the type of branching on the released N-glycans from N protein by ESI-MSn
analysis. Interestingly, we did not observe any evidence for the presence of common tri- or tetraantennary and bisecting GlcNAc structures. Instead, we observed uncommon N-glycans with
terminal GalNAc and sialic acid linked GalNAc structures. Such GalNAcâ€“GlcNAc-R (LacdiNAc,
LDN) glycan structures are known to play critical role in many biological processes and are
considered key determinants that can be recognized by the adaptive and innate immune systems
via multiple carbohydrate-binding proteins.26-31 The structural confirmation of LDN was
demonstrated by the MSn fragmentation of a representative N-glycan structure in Figure 4A. The
dissociation of the N-glycan with mass 2285 produced a doubly charged fragment with m/z 922.
Subsequent fragmentation of m/z 922 generated a fragment with m/z 1317, supporting the
presence of a biantennary structure with GalNAc termini. Interestingly, any fragments with m/z
1306, which would support the presence of both triantennary and bisecting GlcNAc structures,
are completely absent in the spectra. Similar observations were made on other branched Nglycans, indicating that only biantennary N-glycan structures are present on the N protein (Figure
4A).
Determination of core and antennal fucosylation on N-glycans released from N protein.
We evaluated the presence of core and antennal fucosylation on N-glycan structures and
observed that core fucosylations were predominant (Table S1). However, we observed monofucosylated structures that presented both antennal and core fucosylation. A representative
example is the mono-fucosylated N-glycan with m/z 2040. Upon performing MS2 fragmentation
of this glycan, we observed the presence of both core and antennal fucosylation as a mixture of
isoforms. The m/z 474 fragment and 451 Da neutral loss to form m/z 1588 supports the presence
of core fucosylation. On the other hand, presence of fragments with m/z 442 and m/z 701, and

678 Da neutral loss to generate fragment m/z 1361 shows evidence for the presence of antennal
fucosylation (Figure 4B).
Determination of sialic acid linkage on N- and O- glycans released from N protein.
Our N-glycan analysis showed that only biantennary structures are present on N protein
and gave evidence for the linkage of terminal sialic acids to both galactose and GalNAc on both
arms of glycans. We have determined the linkage of sialic acids attached to both galactose and
GalNAc by fragmenting terminal trisaccharides on each arm of the N-glycans. We found that the
sialic acids could be linked to both O-3 and O-6 of GalNAc (fragments with m/z 150 for 2,6 and
m/z 164 for 2,3 linkages) but were exclusively linked to O-3 of galactose (fragments with m/z 109
and 137) (Figure 4C).
We observed only 2,3 linked sialic acid on the O-glycans released from N protein (Figure 4D).
Characterization of N-glycosylation on nucleocapsid protein by glycopeptide analysis.
Since our glycomics analysis confirmed the presence of N-glycans on the N protein, we
were interested in determining the site-specific glycan distribution. For this purpose, we used
trypsin and elastase proteases both separately and sequentially to produce three glycopeptide
samples. The LC-MS/MS data of these protease digests were analyzed by using search
algorithms in the Byonic software, employing all possible mammalian N-glycans, O-glycans, and
phosphorylation as possible post-translational modifications.
There are five potential N-glycosylation sites on the N protein, and we identified
N-glycosylation on two of the sites. Both confirmed N-glycosylation sites have a very distinct
N-glycosylation profile. The N-glycosylation site N47 had a glycan occupancy of about 53%
(Figure 7A Table S3). We observed only complex type glycan structures at site N47, which is part
of glycopeptide 41RPQGLPNNTASWF53. Based on the common biosynthetic pathway and glycan

NeuAc1GalNAc1Gal1GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2Fuc1 at m/z 3590.51 was found to be most
abundant with 6.56% glycan occupancy relative to other glycoforms at site N47. Moreover, all the
glycans detected at this site featured core fucosylation. We also observed multiple doubly
fucosylated glycans and a minor triply fucosylated structure (0.45%) (Tables S1 and S3). The
Byonic N-glycopeptide search followed by manual validation for accurate precursor mass (5 ppm)
and precise glycan neutral loss in MS/MS experiments (<20 ppm) resulted in detection of N-glycan
on peptide

AYNVTQAFGR276 at site N269. The glycan occupancy at site N269 was found to

be higher (94%) than that of site N47 (53%). At site N269, we detected mostly high-mannose type
glycosylation comprising ~85% of total glycan. The relative percentage of complex and hybrid

The

peptide

69

GQGVPINTNSSPDDQIGYYR88 was detected only in non-glycosylated form (Figure S25),

indicating that N77 is not occupied. The N-glycosylation sites N192 and N196 occur in the linker
region, which is rich in serine and arginine (SR-rich). Investigation of the N-glycosylation at these
sites was extremely difficult because the two N-glycan sequons are located next to each other,
separated by only one arginine residue (Figure 2A). For site N192, the trypsin digest possibly
generated the tripeptide 192NSS195 (Figure 2A) whose small size would make it difficult to fragment
in mass spectrometry and thus manual detection as well as detection through software was
challenging. For site N196, in silico trypsin digestion generated the peptide

196

NSTPGSSR203,

which also contains four potential O-glycan sites (Figure 2A). The software searches for the
possible N-glycan combined with four O-glycans were not successful due to software limitations.
Similarly, in silico analysis of the elastase digest of N protein produced the longer peptide
183

SSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTSPA208, comprising two potential N-glycosylation sites and

fourteen potential O-glycosylation sites, presenting a formidable challenge to software-based
detection (Figure 2A). All these factors made the characterization of N- and O-glycosylation at
this SR-rich linker region extremely difficult. To overcome this obstacle, we set out to locate the
O-glycans on this peptide first, using the de-N-glycosylated N protein. We reasoned that

searching for O-glycosylation in the SR-rich region would later be helpful in finding N-glycans
since confirmed O-glycan information from this de-N-glycosylation experiment would enable
manual/software assisted search for N-glycosylation in non-de-N-glycosylation experiments. To
investigate O-glycosylation in the SR-rich region, we first removed the N-glycans from the N
protein by PNGase F treatment and subsequently digested the protein by trypsin/elastase. The
resulting O-glycopeptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis, followed by manual and
software-assisted searches for O-glycans. This eliminated interference of N-glycans while
searching for O--glycans and reduced the number of possible combinations for manual/softwarebased glycan search. We detected the O-glycosylated 204GTSPAR209 glycopeptide from the linker
region and observed several O-glycans on the peptide (see detection of O-glycosylation section
below). However, even with this stepwise approach, we could not identify any N-glycans at sites
N192 and N196. We also evaluated for the presence of phosphorylation but could not identify any
in the linker region.

O labelling experiment for N-glycosylation site confirmation.

To further investigate the possibility of glycosylation at site N192 and N196 and to confirm the
glycosylation pattern of the N protein, we performed an 18O labelling experiment where N-glycans
are removed from glycoproteins PNGase F in the presence of H218O, followed by enzymatic
digestion with trypsin/elastase. In the process of de-glycosylation, the N-glycan bearing Asn is
converted to

18

O-Asp, which can be detected by mass spectrometry. In this experiment, we

observed conversion of N47 and N269 to 18O labelled Asp, confirming the presence of N-glycans
in these positions. LC-MS/MS analysis of the trypsin & elastase digests detected the peptides,

an N-glycan at N196 (Figure S26). For site N192, we observed neither 18O labeled nor unlabeled
peptide in any of the enzymatic digests.
Detection of O-glycosylation on nucleocapsid protein
For the detection of O-glycosylation, we performed LC-MS/MS experiments on tryptic and
elastase digests separately and sequentially. We also confirmed O-glycosylation on peptides by
removing N-glycans by treatment of PNGase F, followed by enzymatic digestion with trypsin and
elastase. We identified the O-glycosylation on the N protein by performing higher energy
collisional dissociation (HCD) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentations, and
O-glycosylation site occupancy by a targeted electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) MS2
fragmentation on O-glycopeptides. ETD is an ionization technique that induces fragmentation
along the glycopeptide backbone generating c and z ions with the intact glycan, which helps
pinpointing the position of the glycan in the peptide.32 We were able to confirm O-glycosylation on
8 distinct peptides comprising 11 O-glycan sites and determined the site of O-glycan attachment
(Figure 6). The glycan occupancy on three glycopeptides that comprise 4 O-glycosylation sites in
total was lower (<10%) at each site (Figures S113-S115). We observed ions with the mass

confirmed the identity of the glycopeptide (Figures S42-S46). The ETD experiments suggested
that glycosylation is present at site S23 (fragments c8, c9, z9 and c10) (Figure S42). However,
we observed that the glycan occupancy at S23 was only about 2% as shown in Figure S113. HCD
and CID MS2 analysis of glycopeptide 144DHIGTR149 confirmed the O-glycosylation at T148 by the
presence of glycan oxonium ions, peptide fragments (b and y ions) and glycan neutral losses
(Figures S47-S51). The overall glycan occupancy at the site T148 was determined with ~81%,

out of which mono- and di-sialyl Core 2 type glycans (~70%) were the predominant ones (Figure
7B, Table S3). The Byonic glycopeptide search showed a strong indication for the presence of
glycan on the peptide 159LQLPQGTTLPK169. To further evaluate the glycosylation in this peptide,
we manually validated full mass, HCD and CID MS2 spectra that showed presence of oxonium
ions, b and y peptide fragments along with peaks for mass of peptide and peptide+HexNAc
(Figure S53). This glycopeptide contains two possible O-glycosylation sites, the ETD experiment
for the site mapping of T165 or T166 in the peptide

159

LQLPQGTTLPK169 detected two spectra

that showed c and z ions indicating that some of these peptides are O-glycosylated on T165 and
others on T166 (Figures S68 and S69). As shown in ETD MS2 spectra, the diagnostic peaks z5
at m/z 908.57 and c7 at m/z 1120.57 for the presence of glycan at site T165 were observed
(Figure S68). Similarly, the diagnostic peaks z4 at m/z 807.36 and c8 at m/z 1221.65 for presence
of glycans at site T166 (Figure S69) were detected. It was found that the peptide
159

LQLPQGTTLPK169 is almost fully occupied with glycans and Core 1 type structures were

predominant ones by comprising 77% of total glycans at these sites (Figure 7B). However, we
also detected Core 2 to Core 4 type of glycans including extended Core 2 glycan with fucose and
sialic acid on the peptide

159

LQLPQGTTLPK169 (Figures S52-S69). The peptide

204

GTSPAR209,

located in the LKR region, showed presence of O-glycans at both the sites, T205 and S206.
Interestingly, this peptide

204

GTSPAR209 is about 85% occupied with sialylated Core 1 and Core

2 types of glycans in total (Figures 7B and S70 â€“ S76). The Byonic and manual glycoproteomics
search also found presence of the peptide 238GQQQQGQTVTK248 at m/z 1858.8428 with glycans
HexNAcHexNeuAc that contains sites T245 and T247 at the CTD region (Figure S79). Based on
full mass and fragment ions, another peptide

376

ADETQALPQR385 that contains O-glycosylation

site T379 showed indication of presence of glycan (Figures S81-S90). Nonetheless, the peptides
238

GQQQQGQTVTK248 and

376

ADETQALPQR385 were mostly unoccupied (>90%, Figures S114-

S115). Towards the C-terminus end of N protein, the peptide 388KQQTVTLLPA397 which includes
O-glycosylation sites T391 and T393, was found with attached glycans. The ETD experiments

detected corresponding c and z peptide fragment with intact glycan suggesting that the site T391
is glycosylated (Figure 5D). At site T391 di-sialylated Core 1 to Core 2 type glycans were
predominant over other glycans (Figures 7B and S91-S105, Table S4). Interestingly, site S404
was found to contain only mono- and di-sialylated Core 2 type structures as shown in Figures
S106-S108. We confirmed the O-glycan structures and glycosylation sites through both Byonic
software search, as well as manual analysis. In summary, as shown in Figure 7B the sites T148,
T165, T166, T205, S206, T391, and S404 showed the presence of significant levels of Oglycosylation (47%-90%) and the sites S23, T245, T247 and T379 indicated a lower level (1%9%) of O-glycosylation (Figures S113-S115). We identified Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, and Core 4
type O-glycans at these sites, confirming the glycomics analysis findings (Figure 3B and Table
S2).
Phosphorylation on nucleocapsid protein
N proteins from coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 (Uniprot ID P59595) and MERS-CoV
(Uniprot ID K9N4V7, uniprot.org) have been known as phosphoproteins.33 However, to the best
of our knowledge, there are no reports of site-specific phosphorylation for SARS-CoV-2, therefore
we included the identification of phosphorylation sites present on SARS-CoV-2 N protein.13 We
conducted the Byonic based phosphate search, along with O-glycans in the elastase digest of the
N protein sample. In this experiment we identified phosphorylation on glycopeptide
KQQTVTLLPA397 that contains two potential sites â€“ T391 and T393, for glycosylation and

388

phosphorylation. As shown in the HCD MS2 spectrum (Figure S110), the glycopeptide identity
was confirmed by validating b and y ions and glycan neutral losses. The strong peaks for presence
of peptide, peptide+HexNAc and peptide+2HexNAc at m/z 1098.65, 1301.73 and 1504.81 further
confirmed the glycosylation on this peptide. The presence of a phosphate in the peptide was
confirmed by CID MS2 experiments using the high-resolution precursor mass and neutral losses
of phosphate (loss of m/z 79.9663) from the glycopeptide (Figures 4C and S111). As shown in

the deconvoluted CID MS2 spectrum (Figure S11), the peak at m/z 1584.77 represents the
glycopeptide fragment

388

KQQTVTLLPA397 with a phosphate group and glycan, and the peak at

m/z 1504.81 represents the same peptide with only glycan showing neutral loss of one phosphate
group of 79.9663 Da. Similarly, peaks at m/z 975.45 and at 935.98 show loss of a phosphate
group from the peptide fragment bearing a HexNAc3Hex glycan. In the site mapping ETD
experiments of this peptide, we observed characteristic c4, c6 and z5, z7 ions at m/z 1565.76,
1846.15, 578.26 and 1840.85, respectively, to unambiguously assign the site of phosphorylation
at site T393 and glycan at site T391 (Figures 4D and S109). Interestingly, the peptide with
phosphorylation modification also has Core 1 to Core 4 type O-linked glycosylation, including
fucosylated glycans, as shown in Figure 7B and Table S4. Additionally, we identified a longer
peptide with phosphorylation on glycopeptide

389

QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK405 that contains three

potential sites â€“ T391, T393 and S404 â€“ confirming the glycosylation and phosphorylation. The
presence of a phosphate in the peptide was confirmed by CID MS2 experiments using the highresolution precursor mass and neutral losses of phosphate (loss of m/z 79.9663) from the
glycopeptide (Figure S112). As shown in the deconvoluted CID MS2 spectrum in Figure S112,
the peak at m/z 2964.30 represents the glycopeptide fragment

389

QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK405

bearing the glycan HexNAc2Hex2NeuAc1 and phosphate, and peak at m/z 2884.34 represents
the same peptide with glycan HexNAc2Hex2NeuAc1 showing neutral loss of one phosphate
group.
Sequence alignment of nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2.
The alignment of the N protein sequences of SARS-CoV-1 (ID P59595, 422 amino acids),
MERS-CoV (ID K9N4V7, 411 amino acids) and SARS-CoV-2 (ID P0DTC9, 419 amino acids) via
UniProt reveals that the N protein from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved,
sharing about 90% similarity. This is in agreement with other studies that used slightly different

sequences/alignments.34-35 The N protein sequence of MERS-CoV shares only 42% to 44%
similarity with the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 N protein, respectively.
As shown in Figure 2B, the N protein sequence of SARS-CoV-1 carries 3 N-linked glycosylation
motifs (-NXS/T- with Xâ‰ P), whereas SARS-CoV-2 carries 2 additional sites â€“ totaling 5 potential
N-glycan sites for SARS-CoV-2. MERS-CoV carries 6 N-linked glycosylation motifs in total: Two
of the potential N-glycan sites are unique to MERS-CoV, two overlap with motifs found in SARSCoV-2, and the remaining two motifs are found in all three sequences of MERS-CoV, SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. As mentioned before, neither MERS-CoV nor SARS-CoV-1 have been
reported as possessing N-glycans on the N protein in previous studies. Overall alignment of
potential N-glycosylation sites among the three N proteins and the data presented in this study
indicate the high likelihood of the presence of N-glycans in the N proteins of all three coronavirus
species.

Discussion
The coronavirus N protein consists of three distinct but highly conserved domains,
including an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and
a central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker domain, which displays an intrinsically disordered structure and
facilitates molecular movements to aid interactions. The NTD is reportedly responsible for RNA
binding, CTD for oligomerization, and the SR-rich linker is generally known to be primarily involved
in phosphorylation events.36-38 However, no site specific glycosylation nor phosphorylation was
reported in any of these domains in the current literature on SARS-CoV-2. Our LC-MS/MS studies
have shown that the N protein contains N- and O-glycosylation, in addition to phosphorylation.
The coronavirus N protein-NTD associates with the 3â€² end of the viral RNA genome through
electrostatic interactions.39 In the NTD, we identified one N-glycosylation site (N47) and three O-

glycosylation sites (T148, T165 and T166), which possibly play a role in regulating the RNAbinding activity. In the CTD, we observed minor O-glycosylation at sites T245 and T247 and Nglycosylation at site N269. Considering the role of CTD in oligomerization and self-association,
future studies on the role of the glycosylation is of vital importance.40 The detailed structural
analysis of the PTMs on the N protein of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 could be a key aspect
in the development of therapeutic agents that specifically and efficiently block the coronavirus
replication, transcription, and viral assembly.36
To our knowledge, the CoV N protein is the only phosphorylated structural protein on the virus,
and this phosphorylation has been proposed to play a role in regulating its functions.41-43 Evidence
of significant conformational changes in the N protein structure due to phosphorylation has been
reported.44 Importantly, N protein from SARS-CoV-1 have been shown to elicit a well-defined
immunological response, which underscores the importance of the N protein as a potent target
for a vaccine against COVID-19 infection.45 A recent study aimed to investigate effect of early
SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses on disease outcome found that deceased
patient had stronger antibody responses towards N protein while survivors had much more
stronger antibody response to S protein highlighting the importance of N protein in disease
outcome.46 Therefore, understanding the N protein glycosylation patterns described in this study
may ultimately help in new vaccine design to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

N- and O-linked glycan release, purification, and permethylation
The N protein was purified using SDS-PAGE prior to glycomic analysis (Figure S1). The 6065 kDa gel band was cut into smaller pieces (1 mm squares approx.) and transferred to clean
microcentrifuge tubes. The gel pieces were de-stained by adding 500 ÂµL acetonitrile (ACN):
50mM NH4HCO3 (1:1) and incubated at room temperature (RT) for about 30 min. Tubes were
centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. Then 250 ÂµL ACN was added, and the gel pieces
were incubated for 20-30 min. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatant was discarded. The
gel pieces were then suspended in 500 ÂµL 50mM NH4HCO3 and 3 ÂµL PNGase F added. The
sample was incubated for 18 h at 37 Â°C. The released N-glycans were extracted out by adding
1:2 H2O: ACN (500 ÂµL) at room temperature for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. The
released N-glycans were speed dried, dissolved in with 0.1% formic acid solution (FA), purified
by passing through a C18 SPE cartridge and eluted with 0.1% formic acid solution (3 mL) and
dried by lyophilization. The gel pieces containing O-glycoprotein were digested by adding
sequence grade trypsin in digestion buffer (50 mM NH4HCO3) for 18 hr. at 37 Â°C. The
O-glycopeptides were extracted out from gel by the addition of 1:2, H2O: ACN containing 5%
formic acid (500 ÂµL) and kept at RT for 15 min and supernatant was collected. The released
O-glycopeptides were speed dried and used for the release of O-glycans by Î²-elimination.
The O-glycans were released from the glycopeptide peptide by reductive Î²-elimination
reported elsewhere.32 Briefly, eluted N protein glycopeptides were treated with a solution of
19 mg/500 ÂµL of sodium borohydride in 50mM sodium hydroxide. The reaction mixture was
heated to 45ËšC for 16 h, then neutralized with a solution of 10% acetic acid. The sample was
desalted on a hand-packed ion exchange resin (DOWEX H+) by eluting with 5% acetic acid and
dried by lyophilization. The borates were removed by the addition of a solution of methanol:acetic
Acid (9:1) and evaporation under a steam of nitrogen.

The released N- and O-linked glycans were then permethylated using NaOH/DMSO- methyl
iodide method published previously.32
N- and O-linked glycomic profiling by MALDI-MS and ESI-MSn
The permethylated N- and O-glycans were dissolved in 2 ÂµL of methanol. 0.5 ÂµL of sample
was mixed with equal volume of DHB matrix solution (10 mg/mL in 1:1 methanol-water) and
spotted on to a MALDI plate. MALDI-MS spectra were acquired in positive ion and reflector mode
using an AB Sciex 5800 MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer.
2 ÂµL of permethylated N- and O- glycans dissolved in methanol were mixed with 98 ÂµL of
ESI-MS infusion buffer (1:1:1 â€“ 0.1% formic acid in water (with 1 mM NaOH): methanol:
acetonitrile) and infused directly into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer through a
nanospray ion source. ESI-MSn spectra of glycans were acquired by both total ion monitoring and
manual MSn fragmentation.
Original glycoform assignments were made based on full-mass molecular weight. Additional
structural details were determined by ESI-MSn and analysis with GlycoWorkbench 1.1 software.
Protease digestion of N protein for glycoproteomics
The purified N protein (20 Âµg) expressed on HEK293 cells was dissolved in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate solution and digested with trypsin and elastase separately as well as
sequentially by incubating for 1 h at 37 Â°C. The digest was filtered through 0.2 Âµm filter and
directly analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

solution 2 ÂµL PNGase F was added and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 ËšC for 16 h.
Enzymatic activity of PNGase F was deactivated by heating mixture to 95 ËšC for 5 min followed

by lyophilizing the sample. The de-N-glycosylated protein was then suspended 48 ÂµL 50mM
NH4HCO3 and added 2 ÂµL Elastase (0.5 Âµg/ÂµL). The protein was then digested at 37 ËšC for 16 h.
The enzyme was deactivated by heating to 95 ËšC for 5 min and solvents were removed by speed
vacuum. The peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% FA, filtered through 0.2 Âµm filter and analyzed
via LC-MS/MS.
Data acquisition of protein digests using nano-LC-MS/MS
The glycoprotein digests were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer
equipped with a nanospray ion source and connected to a Dionex binary solvent system (Thermo
Fisher, Waltham, MA). Pre-packed nano-LC column (Cat. No. 164568, Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
MA) of 15 cm length with 75 Âµm internal diameter (id), filled with 3 Âµm C18 material (reverse
phase) were used for chromatographic separation of samples. The precursor ion scan was
acquired at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap analyzer and precursors at a time frame of 3 s were
selected for subsequent MS/MS fragmentation in the Orbitrap analyzer at 15,000 resolution. The
LC-MS/MS runs of each digest were conducted for 180 min. 0.1% formic acid and 80%
acetonitrile-0.1 % formic acid was used as mobile phase A and B, respectively, in order to
separate the glycopeptides. The threshold for triggering an MS/MS event was set to 1000 counts,
and monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled. MS/MS fragmentation was conducted with
stepped HCD (Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation) product triggered CID (Collision-Induced
Dissociation) (HCDpdCID) program. The O-linked glycopeptides were also analyzed for site
mapping by targeted Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) and acquired on both Orbitrap and ion
trap analyzers. Charge state screening was enabled, and precursors with unknown charge state
or a charge state of +1 were excluded (positive ion mode). Dynamic exclusion was also enabled
(exclusion duration of 30 s).

The LC-MS/MS spectra of combined tryptic /elastase digest of N protein were searched
against the FASTA sequence of N protein using the Byonic software 2.3 by choosing appropriate
peptide cleavage sites (semi-specific cleavage option enabled). Oxidation of methionine,
deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, and possible common mammalian N-glycans,
O-glycan and phosphorylation masses were used as variable modifications. The LC-MS/MS
spectra were also analyzed manually for the glycopeptides with the support of the Thermo Fisher
Xcalibur 4.2 software, GlycoMod tool, and ProteinProspector v6.2.1. The HCDpdCID and ETD
MS2 spectra of glycopeptides were evaluated for the glycan neutral loss pattern, oxonium ions
and glycopeptide fragmentations to assign the sequence and the presence of glycans in the
glycopeptides.
