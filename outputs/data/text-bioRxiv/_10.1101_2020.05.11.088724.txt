Abstract
The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent need for scalable methods for clinical
diagnostics and viral tracking. Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled largescale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced
around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both
short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing,
including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment
methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited
by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Here we describe a low-cost,
streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly
and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method
against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an
optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics,
and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach and represents a cost-effective and highly scalable
method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.

Introduction
The global COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a massive public health response
which has included implementation of society-wide distancing measures to limit viral
transmission, the rapid development of qRT-PCR, antigen, and antibody diagnostic tests, as
well as a world-wide research effort of unprecedented scope and speed. Next generation
sequencing technologies (NGS) have recently enabled large-scale genomic surveillance of
infectious diseases. Sequencing-based genomic surveillance has been applied to both endemic
disease, such as seasonal influenza (1), and to emerging disease outbreaks such as Zika and
Ebola (2–4).
As of May 2020, over 16,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been deposited in public
repositories such as NCBI and GISAID (5, 6). Several large-scale consortia in the UK (COG-UK:
COVID-19 Genomics UK), Canada (CanCOGeN: Canadian COVID Genomics Network), and
the United States (CDC SPHERES: SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency
Response, Epidemiology, and Surveillance) have begun coordinated efforts to sequence large
numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Such genomic surveillance has already enabled insights
into the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 (7, 8), including the sequencing efforts by the Seattle
flu study which provided early evidence of extensive undetected community transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 in the Seattle area (9).
A number of different approaches have been used to sequence SARS-CoV-2.
Metagenomic (RNA) sequencing can be used to sequence and assemble SARS-CoV-2 (10).
This approach has the disadvantage that samples must typically be sequenced very deeply in
order to obtain sufficient coverage of the viral genome, and thus the cost of this approach is
high relative to more targeted methods. Sequence capture methods (Figure 1A) can be used to
enrich for viral sequences in order to lower sequencing costs and are being employed to
sequence SARS-CoV-2 (11). Finally, amplicon approaches (Figure 1B), in which cDNA is made
from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and amplified using primers that generate tiled PCR
products are being used to sequence SARS-CoV-2 (3). Since primers cannot capture the very
ends of the viral genome, amplicon approaches have the drawback of slightly less complete
genome coverage, and mutations in primer binding sites have the potential to disrupt the
amplification of the associated amplicon. However, the relatively low-cost of amplicon methods
make them a good choice for population-scale viral surveillance and such approaches have
recently been used successfully to monitor the spread of viruses such as Zika and Ebola (2–4).
The ARTIC network (https://artic.network/) has established a method for preparing
amplicon pools in order to sequence SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1B). The ARTIC primer pools have
gone through multiple iterations to improve evenness of coverage (12). Several variants of the
ARTIC protocol exist in which the pooled SARS-CoV-2 amplicons from a sample are taken
through a NGS library preparation protocol (using either ligation or tagmentation-based
approaches) in which sample-specific barcodes are added, and are then sequenced using
either short-read (Illumina) or long-read (Oxford Nanopore, PacBio) technologies. The library
preparation step currently represents a bottleneck in sequencing SARS-CoV-2 amplicons, in
terms of both cost and labor.
Here we describe an all-amplicon method for producing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
libraries which simplifies the process and lowers the per sample cost for sequencing SARSCoV-2 genomes (Figure 1C). This approach incorporates adapter tails in the ARTIC v3 primer
designs, allowing sequencing libraries to be produced in a two-step PCR process, bypassing
costly and labor-intensive ligation or tagmentation-based library preparation steps. By reoptimizing the pooling strategy for the tailed primers, we demonstrate that this tailed amplicon
approach can achieve similar coverage to the untailed ARTIC v3 primers at equivalent
sequencing depths. We benchmark this approach against both the standard ARTIC v3 protocol
and a sequence capture approach using clinical samples spanning a range of viral loads. The

approach we describe is similar to a tailed-amplicon method that we have used to process more
than 100,000 microbiome samples in recent years in the University of Minnesota Genomics
Center (13), and thus represents a highly scalable method for sequencing large numbers of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in a rapid and cost-effective manner.

Results
We designed a series of experiments in order to test a streamlined tailed amplicon
method and to compare amplicon and sequence capture based methods for SARS-CoV-2
sequencing (Figure 1). We sequenced these samples using Illumina’s Nextera DNA Flex
Enrichment protocol using a respiratory virus oligo panel containing probes for SARS-CoV-2,
the ARTIC v3 tiled primers, and a novel tailed amplicon method designed to reduce cost and
streamline the preparation of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing libraries.
We first evaluated the different SARS-CoV-2 sequencing workflows in their performance
with a previously sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolate strain from Washington state (2019nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) provided by BEI Resources (14). As expected, since the amplicon
approaches are unable to cover sequences at the ends of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the DNA
Flex Enrichment sequence capture method produced the highest genome coverage. At a
subsampled read depth of 100,000 reads, the Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment method achieved
99.96% coverage at a minimum of 10x and 99.69% coverage at a minimum of 100x (Figure 2AB). The ARTIC v3 method prepared with TruSeq library preparation achieved 99.60% coverage
at a minimum of 10x and 97.31% coverage at a minimum of 100x (Figure 2A-B).
We tested a tailed amplicon method (tailed amplicon v1) in which the tailed version of
the ARTIC v3 primers were pooled into two pools in a similar manner to the ARTIC v3 protocol.
The BEI WA isolate strain was amplified for both 25 or 35 PCR cycles, using the same enzymes
and PCR conditions used for the ARTIC v3 data set. The tailed amplicon v1 method produced
lower coverage than the ARTIC v3 method, with 98.87% coverage at a minimum of 10x and
89.40% coverage at a minimum of 100x for the 25 PCR cycle sample and 97.09% coverage at a
minimum of 10x and 81.31% coverage at a minimum of 100x for the 35 PCR cycle sample
(Figure 2A-B). The poorer performance with respect to coverage metrics with the tailed
amplicon v1 protocol was due to substantially worse balance between the different tiled
amplicons than with the ARTIC v3 (untailed) primers (Figure 2C-D). The coefficient of variation
(CV) of the ARTIC v3 sample was 0.49 and the CVs of the tailed amplicon v1 samples were
1.70 and 1.26 for the 25 and 35 PCR cycle samples, respectively.
The ARTIC v3 primers have been through multiple cycles of iteration to achieve
relatively even amplicon balance and genome coverage (12). We reasoned that reducing the
concentration of the primers that were over-represented in the initial round of sequencing may
improve balance. While adjusting the primer concentration for over-represented amplicons did
lower the CV of the tailed amplicon pool, amplicon balance was still substantially worse than
with the untailed ARTIC v3 primers (data not shown).
We next tested whether splitting the tailed SARS-CoV-2 primers into 4 PCR reactions
based on primer performance in the initial sequencing tests could improve balance with the
tailed primer approach. The 4-pool amplification scheme (tailed amplicon v2) achieved coverage
metrics close to the untailed ARTIC v3 approach at comparable read depths with 98.76%
coverage at a minimum of 10x and 95.64% coverage at a minimum of 100x (Figure 2A-B). The
improvement in genome coverage metrics with the tailed amplicon v2 approach was a function
of improved amplicon balance (Figure 2E). The CV of the tailed amplicon v2 sample was 0.52
(comparable to the CV of 0.49 with the untailed ARTIC v3 approach). The same three variants
were detected by all four methods tested (Figure 2F), consistent with prior comparisons of the
USA-WA1/2020 and the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain.
Next, we assessed the performance of the different SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
approaches on a set of deidentified patient samples. We selected 9 SARS-CoV-2 positive
patient samples spanning a range of viral loads as assessed by a qRT-PCR using the CDC
primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N1 and N2 targets, Supplemental Figure
1). In addition, we included two patient negative samples in these experiments. We carried out
initial tests of the Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment protocol, the tailed amplicon v1 approach, and

the ARTIC v3 approach using this sample set. For testing the tailed amplicon v2 approach, and
comparing among all four methods, we used a subset of these patient samples with N1 and N2
Ct values ranging from ~20-35 (Figure 3A).
For the Illumina DNA Flex Enrichment protocol, SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage was
more complete for samples with lower N1 and N2 Cts (ranging from ~20-30) at comparable read
depths and coverage thresholds than with amplicon approaches, similar to the BEI WA isolate
data (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure S2-S3). However, for samples with N1 and N2 Ct values
greater than approximately 30, the number of sequencing reads were substantially reduced and
the proportion of reads mapping to the human genome were substantially increased
(Supplemental Figure S4). The average coverage at a subsampled read depth of 100,000 raw
reads was 99.86% (10x) and 67.94% (100x) for all six test samples. For samples with N1 and
N2 Ct vales of less than 30, average coverage was 99.94% (10x) and 98.01% (100x) at a
subsampled read depth of 100,000 raw reads.
For ARTIC v3 tests, based on the N1 and N2 target Ct values from clinical testing, we
used either 25, 30, or 35 PCR cycles for the amplification reactions. Sufficient amplification to
carry out TruSeq library prep was seen for samples with Cts of around 35 or less. Five patient
samples with N1 and N2 Ct values ranging from ~20-35 and the BEI WA isolate sample were
selected for TruSeq library prep and sequencing; one sample (N1 Ct = 20, N2 Ct = 20.4) was
prepared in triplicate. Consistent with previous descriptions of the ARTIC v3 primers, the
balance between the tiled amplicons across these samples was relatively even, with a mean CV
of 0.61 among the five patient samples tested, and 0.55 for samples with a N1 and N2 Ct of less
than 30 (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure S5). For the ARTIC v3 protocol, the average coverage
at a subsampled read depth of 100,000 raw reads was 98.87% (10x) and 94.21% (100x) for all
five test samples. For samples with N1 and N2 Ct vales of less than 30, average coverage was
98.87% (10x) and 95.95% (100x) at a subsampled read depth of 100,000 raw reads (Figure 3D,
Supplemental Figure S2-S3).
We performed initial tests of the tailed amplicon v1 protocol by amplifying the samples
listed in Figure 3A for 25 or 35 PCR cycles using tailed versions of the ARTIC v3 primers split
into two separate pools. As with the BEI WA isolate sample, the balance observed with the
tailed amplicon v1 approach was worse than the ARTIC v3 protocol, with a mean CV of 1.81
among the six patient samples tested, and 1.28 for samples with a N1 and N2 Ct of less than 30
(Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure S6). This led to decreased coverage at a given read depth for
the tailed amplicon v1 method relative to ARTIC v3 (Figure 3E, Supplemental Figure S2).
Upon splitting the tailed SARS-CoV-2 primers into 4 PCR reactions based on primer
performance in the initial sequencing tests, the tailed amplicon v2 method had much improved
amplicon balance. The mean CV of all six patient samples was 0.76 (compared to a CV of 0.61
with ARTIC v3) and 0.52 for samples with a N1 and N2 Ct of less than 30 (compared to 0.55
with the ARTIC v3 protocol; Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure S7). The tailed amplicon v2
protocol had an average coverage at a subsampled read depth of 100,000 raw reads of 98.60%
(10x) and 87.17% (100x) for all six test samples. For samples with Ct vales of less than 30,
average coverage was 98.81% (10x) and 94.72% (100x) at a subsampled read depth of
100,000 raw reads (Figure 3F, Supplemental Figure S2-S3).
The slightly lower coverage metrics at a given subsampled read depth for the tailed
amplicon v2 method can likely be explained by primer dimer formation during the two-step
amplification process, which is more pronounced for higher N1 and N2 Ct samples
(Supplemental Figure S8). Despite observing negligible amounts of primer dimer products on
the bioanalyzer trace, samples with N1 and N2 Ct values greater than 30 had as much as 50%
primer dimer in the resulting sequencing reads. We have previously reported a substantial size
bias on the MiSeq, which may help explain the preferential clustering and out-sized proportion
of primer dimer reads present in the sequencing data for some samples (15). While this issue
can be overcome by increased sequencing depth, future optimizations aimed at reducing primer

dimer contamination such as more stringent size selection or sequencing on an instrument with
less size bias, such as the NovaSeq (15) could reduce this effect.
Finally, we examined the variants detected in the patient samples for each of the SARSCoV-2 sequencing methods. There was complete concordance in the variant calls for all
samples with N1 and N2 Ct values below 30, but less agreement among variant calls between
methods for the sample with N1 and N2 Ct values of approximately 35 (Figure 4).

Discussion
Here we compare sequence capture and amplicon-based methods for sequencing
SARS-CoV-2 and describe a streamlined tailed amplicon method for cost-effective and highly
scalable SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. In comparing the sequence capture and amplicon-based
methods, there is a trade-off between the completeness of genome coverage and sensitivity
(being able to analyze samples with higher N1 and N2 Ct values. Consistent with other recent
analyses of SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing approaches (16), we observed highly
concordant results from samples with N1 and N2 Ct values of less than 30. For samples with Ct
values between 30 and 35, coverage metrics tended to be less robust at a given read depth and
samples with Ct values of greater than 35 did not perform well under any of the conditions
tested. Based on validation experiments for the University of Minnesota qRT-PCR clinical
COVID-19 diagnostic assay, we estimate that a Ct value of 30 corresponds to roughly 500
SARS-CoV-2 genome copies and a Ct value of 35 corresponds to roughly 15 SARS-CoV-2
genome copies in the 5 µL input used for cDNA creation (17).
We describe a modified workflow for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing which builds on the tiled
amplicon approach developed by the ARTIC consortium and currently employed by many labs
around the world. This tailed amplicon method uses a two-step PCR process similar to
workflows previously described by us and others to generate microbiome or other amplicon
sequencing data (13). Through an iterative testing process, we demonstrate that with the tailed
amplicon v2 method, a four-pool amplification scheme produces data with comparable amplicon
balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach. The tailed amplicon
approach bypasses costly and labor-intensive library preparation steps and will allow for
production of SARS-CoV-2 libraries at high scale (similar workflows are run on tens of
thousands of samples per year in the University of Minnesota Genomics Center) at low cost
(between $20-40 per sample depending on scale, including labor costs). We anticipate that this
approach will aid in the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as well as studies on viral
diversity and evolution, and the influence of virus genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and
clinical outcomes.

Methods
Samples
Extracted RNA from de-identified clinical biospecimens were obtained subsequent to COVID-19
testing at the University of Minnesota for use under the IRB approved protocol “Detection of
COVID 19 by Molecular Methods” (STUDY00009560). Nine samples spanning a range of viral
loads as assessed by the Ct values of the viral N1 and N2 targets by qRT-PCR were selected
for these studies. In addition, two SARS-CoV-2 negative samples were selected to assess
cross-contamination or other sequencing artifacts. The following reagent was deposited by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH:
Genomic RNA from SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR-52285.
RNA extraction
RNA was extracted using one of three kits (Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, Macherey-Nagel
Nucelospin Virus Mini kit, and Biomérieux easyMag NucliSENS system) as described previously
(17). All extraction methods used 100 µL of viral transport medium as input and eluted in 100 µL
of appropriate elution buffer as indicated by manufacturer protocols. The integrity of the
extracted RNA was analyzed using the Agilent high sensitivity RNA screentape assay on Agilent
2200 TapeStation following the manufacturer's guidelines (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR reactions to identify SARS-CoV-2 samples were carried out using a modified version
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay, as
previously described (17). Briefly, three separate 10 µL RT-qPCR reactions were set up in a
384-well Barcoded plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for either the N1, N2, or RP
primers and probes. 2.5 µL extracted RNA was added to 7.5 µL qPCR master mix comprised of
the following components: 1.55 µL nuclease-free water, 5 µL GoTaq® Probe qPCR Master Mix
with dUTP (2X) (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.2 µL GoScriptTM RT Mix for 1-Step RTqPCR (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.75 µL primer/probe sets for either N1, N2, or RP (IDT,
Coralville, IA). Reactions were run on a QuantStudio QS5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) using the following cycling conditions: one cycle of 45°C for 15 minutes, followed by one
cycle of 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1
minute. A minimum of two no template controls (NTCs) were included on all runs. A ΔRn
threshold of 0.5 was selected and set uniformly for all runs. Ct values were exported and
analyzed in Microsoft Excel.
ARTIC v3 amplicon library generation and sequencing.
The following reaction was set up to create cDNA using the ARTIC v3 protocol: 5 µL template
RNA, 11 µL nuclease-free water, 4 µL SuperScript IV VILO master mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA synthesis reactions were incubated at: 25°C for 10 minutes,
followed by 50°C for 10 minutes and 85°C for 5 minutes. cDNA was amplified using each of the
two ARTIC v3 primer pools which tile the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The following recipe was used
to set up the PCR reactions: 2.5 µL template cDNA, 14.75 µL nuclease-free water, 5 µl 5x Q5
reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.5 µL 10 mM dNTPs (Kapa Biosystems,
Woburn, MA), 0.25 µL Q5 Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 2 µL primer pool 1
or 2 (10 µM). Cycling conditions were: 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 25 or 35 cycles of 98°C
for 15 seconds and 65°C for 5 minutes. Pools 1 and 2 were then combined, cleaned up with 1:1
AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA)., and quantified by Qubit Fluorometer and
Broad Range DNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and TapeStation capillary
electrophoresis (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

Eight samples with >1ng/µL concentration of target amplicons were selected for downstream
library preparation. Library preparation was performed following the standard Illumina TruSeq
Nano DNA protocol for 350 base pair libraries (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A total of 100ng of
amplicons from the ARTIC protocol were used as the input for library preparation. Input material
was not sheared, as the amplicons were already the desired fragment length.
Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment with respiratory virus panel.
A modified non-directional NEBNext Ultra II First and Second Strand (#E7771 and #E6111, New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) protocol was used to generate long fragments of doublestranded cDNA as input material for the Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment with respiratory virus
panel. The following reaction was set up for non-fragmented priming of RNA: 5 µL template
RNA and 1 µL NEBNext Random Primers were combined and incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes.
Non-directional first strand cDNA synthesis was performed by combining 6 µl of primed template
RNA, 4 µL NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer, 2 µL NEBNext First Stand Synthesis
Enzyme Mix, and 8 µL nuclease-free water. The first strand synthesis reaction was incubated at
25°C for 10minutes, 42°C for 50 minutes, 70°C for 15 minutes. Second strand cDNA synthesis
was performed by combining 20 µl first strand synthesis product, 8 µL of NEBNext Second
Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer with dUTP mix (10X), 4 µL NEBNext Second Strand
Synthesis Enzyme Mix, and 48 µL nuclease-free water. The second strand synthesis reaction
was incubated at 16°C for 60 minutes. Double-stranded cDNA was purified and concentrated
with 1.8X AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) before eluting into 30 µL of 0.1X TE
Buffer. Double-stranded cDNA size was determined using Bioanalyzer high sensitivity DNA
assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and quantified with Qubit Fluorometer and High Sensitivity
DNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA was used to generate libraries
using the Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, catalog number
20025524) with the respiratory virus oligo panel including SARS-CoV-2 probes (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, catalog number 20042472) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Two-pool tailed amplicon library generation and sequencing.
To generate cDNA upstream of SARS-CoV-2 genome amplification, the following reaction was
set up: 5 µL template RNA, 11 µL nuclease-free water, 4 µL SuperScript IV VILO master mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA synthesis reactions were incubated at: 25°C for
10 minutes, followed by 50°C for 10 minutes and 85°C for 5 minutes. The SARS-CoV-2 genome
was amplified using a two-step PCR protocol. The primary amplification was carried out in a
manner similar to the ARTIC v3 method described above, using two primer pools which tile the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. The following recipe was used to set up the PCR reactions: 2.5 µL
template cDNA, 14.75 µL nuclease-free water, 5 µL 5x Q5 reaction buffer (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.5 µL 10 mM dNTPs (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA), 0.25 µL Q5
Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 2 µL primer pool 1 or 2 (10 µM) for the tailed
v1 protocol. Cycling conditions were: 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 25 or 35 cycles of 98°C
for 15 seconds and 65°C for 5 minutes. The primers for the primary amplification contained both
SARS-CoV-2 targeting sequences (derived from the ARTIC v3 designs), as well as adapter tails
for adding indices and Illumina flow cell adapters in a secondary amplification. These
amplification primers had the following structure (see Supplementary Information for primer
sequences):
Left primers: TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG<SARS-CoV-2 LEFT primer>
Right primers: GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG<SARS-CoV-2 RIGHT
primer>
The PCR products from pool 1 and pool 2 for each sample were combined and then diluted
1:100 in sterile, nuclease-free water, and a second PCR reaction was set up to add the Illumina

Q5 reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.2 µL 10 mM dNTPs (Kapa
Biosystems, Woburn, MA, 0.1 µL Q5 Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.5 µL
forward primer (10 µM), 0.5 µL reverse primer (10 µM). Cycling conditions were: 98°C for 30
seconds, followed by 10 cycles of 98°C for 20 seconds, 55°C for 15 seconds, 72°C for 1 minute,
followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. The following indexing primers were used (X
indicates the positions of the 10 bp unique dual indices):
Forward indexing primer:
AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACXXXXXXXXXXTCGTCGGCAGCGTC
Reverse indexing primer:

Four-pool tailed amplicon v2 library generation and sequencing.
Samples were processed as described above for the two-pool tailed amplicon sequencing
workflow, with the exception that in the first round of PCR, four separate reactions were set up
using primer pools 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2 (see Supplementary Information for primer sequences).
The four PCR reactions were combined in a 1:1:1:1 ratio after an initial PCR amplification of 35
cycles and a 1:100 dilution of the combined PCRs for each sample was indexed according to
the process described above.
Normalization and pooling of tailed amplicon sequencing libraries
10 µL of PCR product for each sample was normalized using a SequalPrep 96-well
Normalization Plate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples were eluted in 20 µL
of elution buffer and 10 µL of each sample was pooled and concentrated to 20 µL using 0.7x
AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The final pooled sample was quantified using a
Qubit Fluorometer and High Sensitivity DNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). To
confirm the expected library size of approximately 550 bp, pooled libraries were run on either an
Agilent Bioanalyzer or TapeStation (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Sequencing
The sample pools were diluted to 2 nM based on the Qubit measurements and Agilent sizing
information, and 10 µL of the 2 nM pool was denatured with 10 µL of 0.2 N NaOH. Amplicon
libraries (ARTIC v3, Tailed v1, Tailed v2) were diluted to 8 pM in Illumina’s HT1 buffer, spiked
with 5% PhiX, and sequenced using a MiSeq 600 cycle v3 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The
Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment library was diluted to 10 pM in Illumina’s HT1 buffer, spiked with
1% PhiX, and sequenced using a and a MiSeq 300 cycle v2 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Analysis
The analysis method for amplicon libraries is as follows: Sample quality was assessed with
FastQC (18). Read-pairs were stitched together using PEAR (19). Human host DNA was filtered
by aligning the stitched reads to the human genome (GRCh38). Reads that did not align to the
host genome were aligned to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 (5) SARS-CoV-2 genome
(MN908947.3) using BWA (20). Amplicon read depths were determined by counting the number
of aligned reads covering the base at the center of each amplicon region. The iVar software
package was used to trim primer sequences from the aligned reads, and iVar and Samtools
mpileup were used to call variants and generate consensus sequences (3). Variants located
outside of the region targeted by the amplicon panel were filtered out (reference genome
positions 1-54 and 29836-29903), and consensus sequences bases corresponding to those
regions were trimmed.

The Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment libraries were analyzed using the same process, except the
iVar primer trimming step was omitted, and no filtering of variants or trimming of consensus
sequence was performed.

Figure 1. Methods for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing compared in this study.
A) In Illumina’s Nextera DNA Flex Enrichment protocol cDNA is tagmented and made into
barcoded sequencing libraries, which are then enriched using sequence capture with a
respiratory virus panel containing probes against SARS-CoV-2. B) In the ARTIC protocol, first
strand cDNA is enriched by amplifying with two pools of primers to generate amplicons tiling the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. These amplicons are then subjected to either Illumina or Oxford
Nanopore library preparation, using methods that either directly add adapters to the ends of the
amplicons or fragment them to enable sequencing on a wider variety of Illumina instruments. C)
The tailed amplicon approach, developed here, enriches first strand cDNA using ARTIC v3
primers containing adapter tails. This allows functional sequencing libraries to be created
through a second indexing PCR reaction that adds sample-specific barcodes and flow cell
adapters.
