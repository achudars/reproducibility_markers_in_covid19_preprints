SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in the upper airway during prodromal stage with resulting viral
shedding into the environment from patients with active disease as well as from asymptomatic
individuals. So far, virus spread has been exclusively contained by non-pharmacological
interventions (social distancing, face masks, hand washing and several measures limiting business
activities or movement of individuals)1,2. There is a need to find pharmacological interventions to
mitigate the viral spread, supporting yet limiting the existing health protection measures while an
effective and safe vaccine will hopefully become available. Hypothiocyanite and lactoferrin as part
of the innate human immune system were shown to have a large spectrum of cidal activity against
bacteria, fungi and viruses2,3. To test their virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 we conducted an
in-vitro study. Here we show a dose-dependent virucidal activity of hypothiocyanite at micromolar
concentrations, slightly improved by the presence of lactoferrin. The two substances are devoid of
any cytotoxicity and may be administered combined by aerosol to exploit their antiviral activity at
the port of entry (mouth, nasal cavity, conjunctiva) or exit (mouth, through emission of respiratory
droplets) of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. Furthermore, aerosol with hypothiocyanite and
lactoferrin combined could also have a therapeutic effect in the lower respiratory tract, at the level
of gas exchange units of the lung, preventing the devastating infection of alveolar type II cells
where ACE2 is highly expressed. An in-vivo validation of in-vitro results is urgently required.

A critical problem with SARS-CoV-2 the etiological agent of COVID-19 is the high
communicability of the infection, with a base reproductive number (R0) estimated to fall within the
range of 2-3, with a mean of 3.28, a median of 2.79 and an interquartile range of 1.16, similar to
SARS-CoV-1 (R0 = 2–5), but much higher than MERS-CoV's (R0 = 0.5)4-6. R0 > 1 means selfsustaining spread of the disease unless infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are enforced
to curb the viral transmission7. Differently from SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 seems able to
replicate efficiently in the upper airways epithelium also during the prodromal stage, when large
amount of viruses can be shed into the environment from asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic
individuals also during the incubation period, which can stretch up to 14 days1,2,8 .
Asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals make up about 90% of patients infected by SARSCoV-2, thus rendering the spread of COVID-19 much easier than SARS, whose communicability
was limited to the critical active phase of the disease, not during the incubation9.

So far, the spread of COVID-19 has been exclusively contained by non-pharmacological health
protection measures, especially social distancing, use of face masks, hand washing, isolation of
confirmed cases, quarantine for close contacts and a number of constraints on several business
activities as well as on social freedom of individuals1,2. Since these public health measures
dramatically impact on the economy of countries and the personal life of people, they cannot be
imposed for long time.

Therefore, there is a need to find pharmacological interventions to prevent and control COVID-19,
supporting yet mitigating the existing IPC measures while an effective and safe vaccine will
hopefully become available. Natural products derived from the innate immune system could be
exploited as candidates for broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. In this regard, hypothiocyanite
(OSCN−) and lactoferrin (LF) can represent promising candidates for new anti-infective therapies.

OSCN− is an anti-infectious agent, present in various exocrine secretions including the interface of
the human central airways epithelium, that is produced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and

thiocyanate (anion SCN−) in presence of a peroxidase enzyme (lactoperoxidase, LPO). While it is
present in the human bronchi10, LPO is nearly absent in the alveoli11. On the other hand, the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells12, is
widely expressed in airways, particularly in nasal epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial
cells13. The LPO-based system inactivates micro-organisms in the extracellular space, indeed the
lack of LPO/H2O2/SCN− in alveoli may result in devastating effects on ACE2-expressing alveolar
type II cells14. In 2014, we have demonstrated for the first time that OSCN− reduces the influenza
virus A(H1N1)pdm09 infectivity when the virus is challenged with OSCN− for 60 min at 37 °C
before infection supporting the possibility to use it for influenza prevention and treatment15.
Thereafter the antiviral activity of OSCN− was tested also against several other strains of influenza
virus, confirming a strain independent virucidal effect16,17.

LF is a natural multifunctional protein belonging to the family of transferrins, which can be found
in human milk and external secretions as saliva, tears, milk, nasal and bronchial secretions,
gastrointestinal fluids and urine mucosal secretions18. As a part of the innate human immune
system, LF was found to be 150 fold over-expressed in SARS patients as compared to healthy
controls19. LF has strong antiviral activity against a large range of DNA and RNA viruses20 and
inhibits SARS-CoV-1 pseudovirus cell entry by binding the heparan sulfate proteoglycans of target
cells21.

95

97

In view of the above considerations, we conducted an in-vitro study on OSCN− and a combination
of OSCN− and LF, with the aim of testing their cytotoxic effect and virucidal activity against
SARS-CoV-2.

To investigate the virucidal activity of OSCN− against SARS-CoV-2 we used a recombinant
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV), encoding the reported gene luciferase instead of the viral
glycoprotein, pseudotyped with the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (rVSV-S). It has been shown
that VSV can be pseudotyped by the S protein obtaining a virus with a tropism dictated by the
heterologous S envelope which represents an excellent surrogate of SARS-CoV-2 to study virus
entry and viral neutralization22. rVSV, as single replication step virus, can be manipulated under
biosafety level 2 conditions, thereby overcoming the biosafety concern due to the manipulation of
highly pathogenic viruses23. To this end, rVSV-S was incubated with different OSCN−
concentrations for 60 min at 37°C, then Vero cells were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI)
0.065 focus forming unit (FFU) per cell. Sixteen hours post infection, cells were lysed and the
luciferase expression was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1a viral infection is inhibited in a dose
dependent manner and the concentration capable of reducing the viral infectivity by 50% (IC50)
was 4.64 μM, a value comparable with that we previously reported for influenza virus
A(H1N1)pdm0915.

To evaluate the correlation between the time of virus exposure to OSCN− and the virucidal activity,
rVSV-S was incubated with OSCN− for 60, 40 or 20 minutes before the infection of target cells
(virus pre-treatment) or directly incubated (co-treatment) during the one hour of virus adhesion to
cells (0 minutes, in Fig 1b). Although the efficiency of the virucidal activity was clearly time
dependent in all the conditions tested, we observed a reduction of the viral infectivity of more than
50% until the concentration of 6.25 μM (Fig 1b), when the virus was incubated with OSCN− before
the infection. Moreover, starting from OSCN− concentration of 12.5 μM a reduction of more than
50% was also observed for the virus treatment during the infection of cells.

We also investigated the virucidal activity of OSCN− and LF combination. Preliminary experiments
ts
with LF showed that concentrations of more than 1 g/L are required to inhibit viral infection (data
not shown). Then, we selected a concentration of 4 g/L that was close to that previously used with
OSCN− in experiments against bacteria24. The combination OSCN−/LF showed a significant
increase of the virucidal activity at lower doses of OSCN−, with an inhibition of viral infection of
more than 90% in comparison to a reduction of 80-85% observed with OSCN− (Fig. 1c) and 25%
with LF alone (data not shown). These data suggest that, in our experimental conditions, OSCN−
has the main virucidal effect, while at lower OSCN− concentrations LF can contribute to improve
the virus inactivation. Of note, addition of OSCN− and LF was not toxic to Vero cells, monitored
for 24 h by the MTT test, indeed the inhibition of viral infectivity is due to the interference of the
compounds on the capacity of the virus to infect cells (supplementary figure 1).

Finally, to validate the results obtained with the rVSV-S, we performed experiments with OSCN−
and OSCN−/LF using SARS-CoV-2. After virus-compound incubation for 60 min, tenfold dilutions
of virus-compound mix were inoculated on Vero-E6 cells (used for virus isolation and propagation))
and the reduction of plaque generation was evaluated. Results reported in figure 2 confirmed the
dose-dependent virucidal activity of OSCN− (fig 2a) and demonstrated that higher doses of OSCN−
can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection also with an incubation of 20 min (figure 2b). In
contrast to the pseudovirus, the enhancement of the virucidal activity of OSCN− was less
pronounced in presence of LF (figure 2c).

Overall, our results indicate that OSCN− has a strong virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2, and
the combination of OSCN−/LF further improved the OSCN− virucidal effect by moderate margin.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 can be divided into three clinical stages depending on where the
infection resides14. In the asymptomatic initial phase, COVID19 infection mostly resides in the nose
where it elicits a minimal localized innate immune response. Scientists are looking for effective
therapeutic strategies to reduce the viral shedding and disease spread. Very recently, a study
evaluated the virucidal activity in-vitro of different commercially available oral rinses against
SARS-CoV-2, assuming that oral rinsing might reduce the viral load of saliva and could thus lower
the emission and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through droplets. Viral infectivity of different
SARS-CoV-2 strains was significantly reduced to undetectable levels by three formulations:
Dequonal (active compounds: Dequalinium chloride and Benzalkonium chloride); Iso-Betadine
mouthwash (Polyvidone-iodine) and Listerine Cool Mint (Ethanol and Essential oils)25. Thus,
preliminary trials aimed to evaluate the reduction of viral shedding in confirmed COVID-19
patients have been registered26,27. In addition, it has been also shown that the mouth spray
ColdZyme, used against common cold, inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro28. For the mild
symptomatic phase, the infection is localized mostly in the pseudostratified epithelium of the larger
airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting
airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because basal cells, progenitor for the
bronchial epithelium, are spared. There may be more severe disease in the bronchioles, where club
cells are likely infected. Mouthwashes and gargling are not effective treatments in this second
phase, nor in the third (potentially lethal) phase of the disease, where the infection spreads into the
gas exchange portion of the lung and infects ACE2-expressing alveolar type II cells. By contrast,
given the absence of cytotoxic effect in our experimental conditions, OSCN− and LF can enter the
respiratory system in the form of aerosol and penetrate deep into the tracheobronchial tree up to
alveolar sacs, inactivating both the viruses nearing the epithelium from outside and virions released
from infected cells, thus mitigating or preventing all the three clinical stages of COVID-19
infection.

ALX-009, a combination of OSCN− and bovine LF developed by ALAXIA SAS for the treatment
of respiratory cystic fibrosis pathogens, has already being successfully tested in a phase 1 clinical
trial (RCT02598999) on healthy volunteers and patients affected by cystic fibrosis2. Interestingly,
OSCN− and bovine LF concentrations in ALX-009 tested against pathogenic bacteria were
considerably higher than those used in our experimental setting, reaching value of 3,600 µM and 8
g/L respectively, which therefore should likely maximize their respective virucidal activity24.
Considering the current emergency situation, ALX-009 could be rapidly tried in clinical settings to
verify its in-vivo efficacy, with the view of preventing the eventual progression of the disease in
symptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals testing positive for COVID-19 at nasal-pharyngeal
swabs, as well as to reduce the virus shedding in asymptomatic subjects.

Vero (African green monkey kidney cells, ATCC® CCL-81), Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL1586) and
HEK293T (ATCC® CRL-11268TM) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(D-MEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBSi). Cells were maintained in a
5% CO2 incubator at 37°C, routinely checked for mycoplasma and confirmed negative. Culture
medium and FBSi were obtained from Gibco (Thermofisher).

290
291
292

SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank: MW000351) and the rVSVΔG-Luc, a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis
Virus containing the gene encoding for the luciferase protein in place of the VSV-G gene29, were
used in the experiments.

Virus stock preparation and titration

294
295

Vero E6 cells were seeded in T175 flasks and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of ≈ 0.1). At
72-96 h post infection (p.i.), supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 2,300 rpm for 10 min, then

stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Viral titer was determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells seeded on
24-well plates. Tenfold virus dilutions were prepared in DMEM and inoculated on confluent VeroE6 cells for 1 h at 37 °C. After that, virus inoculum was removed from each well and cells were
overlaid with 300 µL of 0.6% carboxymethylcellulose (Merck) diluted in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBSi. Seventy-two h p.i., cells were fixed adding 300 µL of 5% formaldehyde (Merck) in
PBS 1x for 30 min at room temperature. Then, cells were stained with crystal violet in 20% ethanol.
Virus titer was measured as plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL) based to the plaques
formed in cell culture upon infection. All studies with viable SARS-CoV-2 were performed in the
certified BSL3 laboratory of the Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, in
biological safety cabinets.

For SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped VSV production (rVSV-S), HEK293T cells were seeded in T175
flasks and then transfected by calcium phosphate-DNA preciptation with 40 µg of pSARS-CoV-2spike plasmid. After 24 h, cells were infected with the rVSVΔG-Luc virus at the multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 4 fluorescent focus-forming units (FFU)/cell. Sixteen hours p.i., cell culture
supernatants were harvested and cell debris were cleared by centrifugation (2,300 rpm for 7 minutes
at 4 °C). Then, virus particles were pelleted by ultracentrifugation on a 20 % p/v a sucrose cushion
(27,000 rpm for 150 min at 4 °C) in a Beckmann SW 28 Ti Swinging-Bucket rotor. Pellets were
resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS1X / tube and mixed. Subsequently, the virus was aliquoted
and stored at -80 °C until use.

Titration of virus was determined by immunofluorescence on Vero cells seeded on 96-well plates.
Viral stock was tenfold serially diluted in DMEM and inoculated on confluent Vero cells for 1 h at
37 °C. Then, cells were washed and DMEM supplemented with 10% FBSi was added. After 18 h,
cells were fixed with precooled methanol-acetone for 1 h at -20 °C. Immune staining was
performed by incubation with 1:3000 anti-VSV-M [23H12] monoclonal antibody (Kerafast) on the
infected cells for 90 minutes at 37°C, followed by incubation with 1:1000 anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor®
488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 60 minutes at 37°C. The fluorescent foci in each well were
counted and viral titer was expressed as focus-forming units per mL (FFU/mL)30.

Compounds preparation and cytotoxicity assay

324
325
326
327

OSCN− solution was prepared via enzymatic reaction with an automated equipment EOLEASE®
(Alaxia, Lyon, France). Due to its intrinsic reactivity, each solution freshly prepared was used alone
or combined with Lactoferrin within 15 min after preparation. Reagents for the OSCN− production
were provided by Alaxia.

328
329
330

Pharma-grade lyophilized Lactoferrin (purity >98%) was made available by Alaxia, as sterile vials.
Lyophilized Lactoferrin was reconstituted as solution with 0.9 % sodium chloride solution at 10
g/L.

331
332

Compound dilutions for virus treatment were performed in Minimum Essential Media (MEM)
purchased by Gibco.

333
334
335
336

Cytotoxicity of OSCN− and LF was determined on Vero and Vero-E6 cells after 24 h of treatment.
Cell viability was tested with an assay based on the reduction of a tetrazolium salt (MTT Cell
Proliferation Assay, Thermofisher) in a 96-well plate format according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

To evaluate the OSCN− and LF virucidal activity, 4 x 104 FFU of rVSV-S were incubated for 1 h at
37 °C with 0 – 3.125 – 6.25 – 12.5 – 25 - 50 and 100 µM of OSCN- with or without 4 g/L of LF.
Positive control (mock sample) was treated with the solution used to prepare the OSCN− simulating
the max OSCN− concentration. Next, Vero cells seeded on 96-well plates were infected for 1h at
37°C. Eighteen hours later, infection was evaluate measuring the relative light unit (RLU) with a
VICTOR Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer) using the Steady-Glo® Luciferase Assay System
(Promega).

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, 1 x 105 PFU were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0 – 6.25 – 12.5 - 25
- 50 and 100 µM of OSCN− with or without 4 g/L of LF. Next, tenfold virus dilutions were prepared
in MEM and processed as above reported for the plaque assay. Viral titer was calculated for each
sample and the virucidal activity was measured evaluating the efficiency of the infection in
comparison to the mock treated control.
