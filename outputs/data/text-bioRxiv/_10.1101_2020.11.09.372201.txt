Abstract

38

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious problem for public health

39

since it was identified in the province of Wuhan (China) and spread around the world producing

40

high mortality rates and economic losses. Nowadays, WHO recognizes traditional,

41

complementary, and alternative medicine for treating COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we

42

investigated the antiviral potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Uncaria tomentosa stem

43

bark from Peru against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The antiviral activity of U. tomentosa against

44

SARS-CoV-2 in vitro was assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque

45

reduction assay. After 48h of treatment, U. tomentosa showed an inhibition of 92.7 % of SARS-

46

CoV-2 at 25.0 µg/mL (p<0.0001) by plaque reduction assay on Vero E6 cells. In addition, U.

47

tomentosa, induced a reduction of 98.6 % (p=0.02) and 92.7 % (p=0.03) in the CPE caused by

48

SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells at 25 µg/mL and 12.5 µg/mL, respectively. The EC50 calculated

49

for U. tomentosa extract by plaque reduction assay was 6.6 µg/mL (4.89 – 8.85 µg/mL) for a

50

selectivity index of 4.1. The EC50 calculated for U. tomentosa extract by TCID50 assay was 2.57

51

µg/mL (1.05 – 3.75 µg/mL) for a selectivity index of 10.54. These results showed that U.

52

tomentosa known as Cat´s claw has antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 observed as a

53

reduction in the viral titer and CPE after 48h of treatment on Vero E6 cells. Therefore, we

54

hypothesized that U. tomentosa stem bark, could be promissory to the development of new

55

therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

67

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused serious public

68

health problems since it was identified in Wuhan (China) in late 2019 [1]. The World Health

69

Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March

70

11, 2020 [2]. According to the latest report of the WHO, over 40,2 million cases and 1,100,000

71

deaths by COVID-19 were confirmed to October 20, 2020 [3]. When, the novel coronavirus

72

(SARS-CoV-2) arrived to Latin-America, Brazil was the first South American country to

73

declare a patient with COVID-19 whereas Venezuela and Uruguay were the ultimate nations to

74

confirm their patient zero considering the pandemic epicenter after Europe [4]. Although some

75

vaccines phase 3 medical trials are being tested in different countries sponsored by the

76

pharmaceutical industry, currently, there is no vaccines, preventive treatment or antiviral drug

77

available against SARS-CoV-2 [5].

78

Nowadays, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that traditional, complementary,

79

and alternative medicine has many benefits [6]. Several candidates with possible antiviral

80

effects have been explored from medicinal plants in the preclinical phase. Uncaria tomentosa

81

(Willd) DC., (U. tomentosa) belongs to Rubiaceae family, which is also known as Cat’s claw, it

82

contains more than 50 phytochemicals [7]. Oxindole alkaloids (pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids

83

(POA) and tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids (TOA)) have been recognized as fingerprint of this

84

species in some pharmacopeias and several pharmacological activities are linked to this kind of

85

alkaloids [8,9]. It has been demonstrated that Uncaria tomentosa (U. tomentosa) exerts an

86

antiviral effect on human monocytes infected with dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) [10] and herpes

87

simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [11]. In our previous studies in silico, U. tomentosa´s components

88

inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme 3CLpro and disrupted the interface of the receptor-binding

89

domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( RBD–ACE-2) as well as the SARS-CoV-2 spike

90

glycoprotein [12,13]. Additionally, bio-activities as anti-inflammatory [14], antiplatelet [15] and

91

immunomodulatory [16] were demonstrated. Furthermore, other components isolated from the

92

stem bark such as quinovic acids, polyphenols (flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and tannins),

93

triterpenes, glycosides and saponins were identified by instrumental methods [9,17–20].

94

The evaluation of natural compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical studies might lead

95

to discover new antiviral drugs and for a better understanding of the viral life cycle. Several cell

96

lines such as Human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 cells, Caco-2 cells, Calu-3 cells,

97

HEK293T cells, and Huh7 cells are considered the best models in vitro to determine the

98

antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 [21]. Hence, the investigations of medicinal plants using

99

specially Vero E6 cell to replicate SARS-CoV-2 and given that is highly expressed the ACE -2

100

receptor, in kidney tissue, some mechanism could be evaluated due to the characteristics of this

101

culture medium.

102

Although the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is not completely understood, a severe

103

inflammatory process has been associated with the severity and progression of the disease [22].

104

Therefore, the immune activation so far described during the course of the infection as well as

105

the pulmonary injury could be ameliorated by U. tomentosa due to its traditional use as anti-

106

inflammatory [23], in the folk medicine from South America during years.

107

Based on its antiviral activity on other ARN virus and our in-silico findings against SARS-

108

CoV-2, we assayed the hydroalcoholic extract of U. tomentosa stem bark from Peru as potential

109

antiviral agent in vitro against this novel coronavirus.

Material and method

112

2.1.

Plant material

113

The U. tomentosa (Cat´s claw) used in this investigation is dispensed to patients of the

114

Complementary Medicine Service of EsSalud (Social Health Insurance) in Peru for

115

inflammatory disorders. The raw material (stem bark) of U. tomentosa was sourced from the

116

Pharmacy Office of EsSalud in Ica, Peru. Next, the stem bark of U. tomentosa was transported

117

to the Faculty of Medicine, of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM,

118

Lima, Peru) in order to obtain the hydroalcoholic extract.

119

2.2.

120

One hundred grams of the raw plant material (stem bark) of U. tomentosa was powdered and

121

extracted with 700 ml of 70% ethanol at room temperature for 7 days. Then, the extract was

122

evaporated by using rotary evaporation to obtain a desiccated extract, which was stored at 4 °C

123

until further use.

125

One mg of U. tomentosa hydroalcoholic extract was suspended in 1mL of DMSO. The solution

126

was maintained at room temperature, protected from light until use. To prepare a working

127

solution, the stock was diluted to 50mg/mL in DMEM supplemented with 2% Fetal Bovine

128

Serum (FBS) (Final concentration DMSO 5%).

131

Vero E6 epithelial cell line from Cercopithecus aethiops kidney was donated by Instituto

132

Nacional de Salud (INS) (Bogotá, Colombia). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified

133

Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Cultures

134

were maintained at 37°C, with 5% CO2. Infections were done with a viral stock produced from a

135

Colombian isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Colombia/ANT-UdeA-200325-01/2020).

138

The viability of Vero E6 in the presence of U. tomentosa extract was evaluated using a MTT

139

(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, Vero E6 were

140

seeded at cell density of 1.0x104 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24h at 37ºC in a

141

humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After, 100 µL of serial dilutions (1:2) of U. tomentosa extract

142

ranging from 3.1 to 50 µg/mL were added to each well and incubated for 48 h, at 37ºC with

143

5% CO2. After incubation, supernatants were removed, cells were washed twice with Phosphate

144

Buffered Saline (PBS) (Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) and 30 µL of the MTT reagent (Sigma

145

Aldrich) (2 mg/mL) were added. The plates were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C, with 5 % CO2,

146

protected from light. Then, formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 µL of pure DMSO

147

to each well. Plates were read in a multiskan GO spectrophotometer (Thermo) at 570 nm. The

148

average absorbance of cells without treatment was considered as 100% of viability. Based on

149

this control the cell viability of each treated well was calculated. The treatment concentration

150

with 50% cytotoxicity (The 50% cytotoxic concentration - CC50) was obtained by performing

151

nonlinear regression followed by the construction of a concentration-response curve (GraphPad

152

153

performed (n=8).

at 37ºC with 5% CO2. After incubation, 50uL of double dilutions of cat's claw (3.1 – 25 µg/mL)

160

were added to the cell monolayers during 1 h, 37 ºC, 5 % CO2. Then, the treatment was

161

removed, and cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 stock at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

162

of 0.01 in 50uL of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. The inoculum was removed 1-hour post

163

infection (h.p.i), replaced by 170 µL of cat's claw dilutions and incubated for 48 h, at 37 °C

164

with 5 % CO2. After, cell culture supernatants were harvested and stored at −80 °C for virus

165

titration by plaque assay and TCID50 assay. The supernatant of infected cells without treatment

166

was used as infection control. Chloroquine (CQ) at 50 µM was used as positive control for

167

antiviral activity; 2 independent experiments with 3 replicates of each experiment were

168

performed (n=6).

170

2.6.1. Plaque assay for SARS-CoV-2 quantification

171

The capacity of U. tomentosa extract to decrease the PFU/mL of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated

172

by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Briefly, 1.0 x 105 Vero E6 cells per well were seeded in 24-

173

well plates for 24 h, at 37°C, with 5% CO2. Tenfold serial dilutions of the supernatants obtained

174

from the antiviral assay (200uL per well) were added by duplicate on cell monolayers. After

175

incubation during 1h, at 37°C, with 5% CO2, the viral inoculum was removed and 1 mL of

176

semi-solid medium (1.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose in DMEM 1X with 2% FBS and 1%

177

Penicillin-Streptomycin) was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 5 days at 37°C, with

178

5 % CO2. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS. After, cells were fixed and stained with 500

179

uL of 4 % Formaldehyde / 1 % Crystal violet solution for 30 minutes and washed with PBS.

180

Plaques obtained from each condition were counted. The reduction in the viral titer after

181

treatment with each concentration of U. tomentosa extract compared to the infection control is

182

expressed as inhibition percentage. Two independent experiments with two replicates of each

183

experiment were performed (n=4).

184
185

2.6.2. TCID50 for SARS-CoV-2 quantification

186

The capacity of U. tomentosa extract to diminish the CPE caused by SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6

187

was evaluated by TCID50 assay. Briefly, 1.2 x 104 Vero E6 cells per well were seeded in 96-well

188

plates for 24 h, at 37°C, with 5% CO2. Tenfold serial dilutions of the supernatants obtained

189

from the antiviral assay (50 µL per well) were added by quadruplicate on cell monolayers. After

190

1h incubation, at 37°C with 5% CO2, the viral inoculum was removed and replaced by 170 µL

Formaldehyde / 1 % Crystal violet solution for 30 minutes. Cell monolayers were washed with

194

PBS. The number of wells positive for CPE were determined for each dilution (CPE is

195

considered positive when more that 30% of cell monolayer if compromised).

196

The viral titer of TCID50/mL was calculated based on Spearman-Käerber method. The reduction

197

of viral titer after treatment with each concentration of U. tomentosa extract compared to

198

infection control is expressed as inhibition percentage. A control of cells without infection and

The viability of Vero E6 cells in presence of U. tomentosa was higher than 90.0 % at

215

concentrations of 25.0 µg/mL or lower, after of 48 h of incubation (Figure 1). Cell viability at

216

50.0 µg/mL was 17.3 %; for this reason, this concentration was not included in the antiviral

217

assay. The CC50 calculated for U. tomentosa was of 27.1 µg/mL. Chloroquine at 50uM (positive

showed an inhibition of 31.4 % and 34, 9 % of SARS-CoV-2 at 12.5 and 6.3 µg/mL,

224

respectively (Figure 2). An increase of 76.0 % of PFU/mL of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained after

225

the treatment with U. tomentosa extract at 3.1 µg/mL (p= 0.02) (Figure 2). The EC50 calculated

226

to the extract by plaque assay was 6.6 µg/mL (4.89 – 8.85 µg/mL) for a selectivity index of 4.1.

227

– 3.75 µg/mL) for a selectivity index of 10.54. Chloroquine (50 µM) inhibited the CPE of

234

SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 in a 100 % (p=0.008) (Figure 3).

236

In South America, the second wave of novel coronaviruses might be more aggressive,

237

increasing the mortality rate and new cases [24]. Medical trials are underway to determine the

238

efficacy of several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 [25]. Otherwise, herbal medicines could

239

become a promising option to tackle the ongoing pandemic caused by COVID 19 [26]. Some

240

plant extracts and phytochemicals were modeled over numerous targets of SARS-CoV-2 by

241

using in silico studies, which is the first step in the discovery of new drugs. In China, the use of

242

herbal formulas has been included in the protocol of primary attention in COVID-19 and

243

medical trials were carried out, and promising results to ameliorate the symptoms were

244

demonstrated [27].

245

Our previous study of U. tomentosa (cat´s claw) on this novel coronavirus using in-silico

246

analysis showed that two possible mechanisms could be involved in the in vitro antiviral

247

activity against SARS-CoV-2 observed in this study. These findings revealed that 3CLpro, an

248

essential enzyme for viral replication, showed key molecular interactions with speciophylline,

249

cadambine, and proanthocyanidin B2, with high binding affinities ranging from −8.1 to

250

−9.2 kcal/mol. [12]. On the other hand, phytochemicals of U. tomentosa such as

251

Proanthocyanidin C1, QAG-2, Uncarine F, 3-isodihydrocadambine, and Uncaric acid (docking

252

scores: -8.6; -8.2; -7.1; -7.6 and -7.0 kcal/mol, respectively ) showed high binding affinity for

253

the interface of the RBD–ACE-2. In addition, 3-dihydro-cadambine, Proanthocyanidin B4,

254

Proanthocyanidin B2, and Proanthocyanidin C1 (-7.1; -7.2; -7.2 and -7.0 kcal/mol, respectively)

255

had the highest binding score on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [13]. Since Vero E6 cells are

256

commonly used to replicate SARS-CoV-2 due to the high expression level of the ACE-2

257

receptor and lack the ability to produce interferon [28], they are the appropriate substrate to

258

explore the antiviral activity of phytochemicals targeting the receptor binding.

259

Mechanisms of the antiviral activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of U. tomentosa, on other

260

viruses like Dengue (DEN-2), have been elucidated; alkaloids (pentacyclic alkaloids) from U.

261

tomentosa induced apoptosis of infected cells and reduced inflammatory mediators such as

262

TNF-α, and IFN-α with similar effects to dexamethasone [10]. The quinovic acids (33.1-60

264

μg/mL) inhibited the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus [29], and the total extract at concentrations less
than 15.75 μg/mL inhibited the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) replication when added to Vero

265

cells at the same time than the virus [11].

266

Here, we demonstrated that U. tomentosa also has an antiviral activity in vitro against the

267

SARS-CoV-2 with the EC50 calculated by plaque assay at 6.6 µg/mL (95% CI: 4.89 – 8.85

268

µg/mL) and by TCID50 assay at 2.57 µg/mL (95% CI: 1.05 – 3.75 µg/mL). Whilst the

269

corresponding to a 50 % cytotoxic effect was 27.1 µg/mL for U. tomentosa. In other medicinal

270

plants assayed against SARS-CoV-2, similar antiviral activity was shown; in particular,

Echinaforce® (an Echinacea purpurea preparation) exhibited an antiviral activity at 50 μg/mL

272

[30]. Liu Shen capsule, a traditional Chinese medicine, inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication

273

with an EC50 value of 0.6024 μg/mL and CC50 of 4.930 μg/mL [31]. Likewise, Phillyrin (KD-

274

1), a representative constituent of Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) presented an EC50 at 63.90

275

µg/mL and CC50 of 1959 µg/mL [32]. Sulfated polysaccharides named RPI-27 and heparin

276

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with an EC50 of 8.3 ± 4.6

277

respectively [33]. In our study, the selectivity index (SI) of the hydroalcoholic extract of U.

278

tomentosa was 4.1. In spite of SI is a low value, theoretically having a higher value would be

279

more effective and safer during in vivo treatment for a given viral infection. However, there is

280

no evidence of severe toxicity of the U. tomentosa and traditionally its use popular in the form

281

of maceration or decoction is safety [34] .

282

There is enough evidence that U. tomentosa could ameliorate a wide array of symptoms

283

associated with COVID-19, like the severe inflammation characterized by a cytokine storm [23]

284

causing endothelial dysfunction. According to the antiviral activity of U. tomentosa against

285

SARS-CoV-2, several biochemical mechanisms could be involved in each phase of the viral life

μg/mL

and 36 ± 14

μg/mL,

cycle. As previously reported, U. tomentosa could interfere with viral entrance into host cells

287

[12], affecting viral replication [13]. Furthermore, ACE-2 receptors, which are expressed in

288

Vero E6 cells could also be blocked by the phytochemicals of U. tomentosa during the entrance

289

of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells and the aforementioned in-silico study would confirm our

290

hypothesis [13].

291

Besides, it might control the hyperinflammation, via inhibition of IL-1α, 1β, 17, and TNF-α

292

[35], reducing oxidative stress [36], and protecting the endothelial barrier, via inhibition of IL8,

293

which is linked to the induction of permeability [37]. It also has antithrombotic potential via

294

antiplatelet mechanism and by inhibiting of thrombin [15]. Furthermore, U. tomentosa

295

modulates the immune system by extending lymphocyte survival via an anti-apoptotic

296

mechanism [38]. It is known that the 3α protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated

297

coronavirus induces apoptosis in Vero E6 cells [39]; therefore, the phytochemicals found in the

298

hydroalcoholic extract could inhibit this process and protect of the inflammatory cascade.

299

Interestingly, U. tomentosa bark extract reduced the lung inflammation produced by ozone in

300

mice [40].

301

Based on our results, U. tomentosa is a promising medicinal herb to combat COVID-19, but it is

302

necessary to continue with animal models followed by clinical trials to validate our results in

303

the context of COVID-19 patients. This study is the first approach of U. tomentosa against

304

SARS-CoV-2 and we have to explore specific mechanisms of inhibition and propose the main

305

molecules involved with the antiviral activity. As shown in our phytochemical analysis, the

306

presence of groups chemicals determined by LC/MS (UHPLC-ESI+-HRMS-Orbitrap) such as

307

spiroxindole

308

proanthocyanidins, they could be responsible for the described activity. Here, the mechanisms

309

discussed about the hydroalcoholic extract of U. tomentosa are only inferred under the

310

mechanisms evaluated in other RNA viruses reported in the literature, and our previous in-silico

311

studies demonstrated on the novel coronavirus.

312

5.

313

U. tomentosa has been widely used as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent.

314

Previous studies have shown that U. tomentosa has a broad spectrum of effects on several RNA

315

viruses. In this study, we demonstrated that hydroalcoholic extract of U. tomentosa stem bark

316

exerted an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by inhibiting virus replication in-vitro using the Vero E6

alkaloids, indole

animal models and finally validate its clinical use with medical trials. However, further specific

319

in vitro assays combined with in vivo studies need to be carried out to validate this in-vitro

finding. Our investigation shows for the first time the antiviral effect of U. tomentosa on novel

321

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
