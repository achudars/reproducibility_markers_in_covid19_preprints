Abstract (150 words)

17
18

Extensive testing is essential to break the transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,

19

which causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostics have

20

emerged as attractive alternatives to quantitative real-time PCR due to their faster turnaround

21

time and their potential to be used in point-of-care testing scenarios. However, existing

22

CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA

23

editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that

24

is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its

25

genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human

26

cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than

27

wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of

28

single nucleotide variations. Our assay can be completed in 30 minutes with a dipstick for a

29

rapid point-of-care test.

Introduction

36
37

COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus of

38

zoonotic origin. The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China1-3 and has since spread to

39

more than 200 countries in all continents. As of 26 May 2020, there are over 5.4 million

40

confirmed cases and 340,000 deaths worldwide, underscoring the severity of the disease.

41

Importantly, given the high human-to-human transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2

42

including from asymptomatic carriers4-6, rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for timely

43

treatment and outbreak control. Currently, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the gold

44

standard method to detect COVID-19. However, it requires specialized and expensive

45

instrumentation to run and thus must be carried out in dedicated facilities with the necessary

46

equipment and expertise. Furthermore, the turnaround time for qRT-PCR is too slow. Even

47

excluding the time it takes to transfer samples from collection points to the test facilities, the

48

PCR process itself will take more than an hour to run. Besides qRT-PCR, serological tests

49

that detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are actively under development. However, such

50

tests have limited practical use for identifying infectious individuals as antibodies are only

51

detectable in later stages of infection when opportunities to treat and limit disease

52

transmission have passed. Hence, there is still an unmet need for rapid, specific, and sensitive

53

point-of-care tests (POCT) for SARS-CoV-2 that are easy to use and can be performed in

54

resource-limited settings.

55
56

CRISPR-Cas has emerged as a powerful technology that can potentially drive next-

57

generation diagnostic platforms. After binding to and cutting a specific target substrate,

58

certain Cas enzymes are then hyperactivated to cleave all neighbouring nucleic acids

59

indiscriminately7-9. By programming the Cas nuclease to recognize desired sequences, such

60

as those containing cancer mutations or from pathogens-of-interest, and providing single-

61

stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA reporter molecules in the reaction mix, various groups have

62

successfully developed CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) for a range of applications9-

63

14

. Unsurprisingly, it has also not escaped attention that the same technology can be quickly

64

applied to tackle the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Within a few months, nine different

65

CRISPR-based assays have been announced so far (Table 1)15-23, underscoring the ease-of-

66

use and versatility of the technology.

68

While promising, all the existing CRISPR-Dx for COVID-19 have not considered the

69

possibility that the viral sequences may be altered over time or in human cells. Viruses are

70

known to mutate especially under selective pressure. Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

71

had been sequenced and deposited in the GISAID database24,25 and analysis of their

72

sequences revealed numerous mutations, suggesting an ongoing adaptation of the coronavirus

73

to its novel human host26. In particular, mutations had been discovered in the target sites of

74

many current COVID-19 diagnostic tests and could affect the performance of these qRT-PCR

75

tests27. Moreover, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may also create mismatches in the

76

guide RNA (gRNA) binding site and consequently affect the Cas ribonucleoprotein (RNP)

77

complex’s ability to recognize its target. In addition, ADAR and APOBEC deaminases form

78

part of the human host’s innate immune responses to viral infection and had recently been

79

shown to edit SARS-CoV-2 RNA28. The respective adenosine-to-inosine and cytosine-to-

80

uracil changes may also affect the ability of the CRISPR-Cas system to detect the virus.

81
82

Here, we report the development of CRISPR-Dx for COVID-19 that incorporate design

83

features that mitigate the loss in signal caused by genomic mutations or RNA editing. We

84

screened several different Cas12a enzymes and found that enAsCas12a, an engineered variant

85

of AsCas12a29, was able to tolerate mismatches at the target site better than wildtype Cas12a

86

nucleases. Furthermore, we demonstrated that incorporation of two gRNAs into the CRISPR-

87

Cas system resulted in partial rescue of the output signal when a variant nucleotide was

88

present in the substrate. Notably, while our assay could tolerate single nucleotide variations

89

in the target sites, it still maintained high specificity and was able to distinguish SARS-CoV-

90

2 from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reliably. Taken together, our VaNGuard (Variant

91

Nucleotide Guard) test holds the potential to address the need for a robust and rapid

92

diagnostic assay that will help arrest viral spread and enable worldwide economies to re-open

93

safely in the pandemic.

Results

104
105

Characterization of an existing N-gene gRNA

106
107

We started off by examining the design of the earliest CRISPR-based assay for COVID-1915.

108

In this DETECTR assay, wildtype LbCas12a was paired with a 20-nucleotide (nt) gRNA

109

targeting the N-gene of SARS-CoV-2. Given that various Cas12 enzymes had been

110

successfully utilized for human genome engineering, we asked if LbCas12a was the best

111

nuclease to deploy in a diagnostic test. To this end, we purified five different Cas12a

112

enzymes and then paired each one of them with the same gRNA (herein termed N-Mam

113

gRNA) in a fluorescence trans-cleavage assay (Fig. 1a). To assess the feasibility of a

114

CRISPR-based diagnostic assay being deployed in a non-laboratory setting (e.g. a home

115

setting), we carried out the reactions at room temperature using a 500-base pair (bp) synthetic

116

DNA fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Fluorescence was monitored over the course of

117

30 minutes in a microplate reader (Supplementary Fig. 1). Expectedly, LbCas12a was able to

118

clearly detect SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV at the

119

end of the reaction. Nevertheless, the other four Cas12a enzymes also performed similarly to

120

LbCas12a, with enAsCas12a yielding an even higher fluorescence signal than LbCas12a in

121

the presence of the intended SARS-CoV-2 substrate (Fig. 1b). We also found that the

122

minimum spacer length for the N-Mam gRNA was 20nt, as shortening of the spacer led to a

123

reduction in fluorescence output for all the tested nucleases.

124
125

Next, we tested how mismatches at the gRNA-substrate interface may affect the fluorescence

126

signal. We generated ten new gRNAs targeting the same N-Mam locus, with each harbouring

127

a single point mutation at variable locations along the spacer (Fig. 1c). From the trans-

128

cleavage assay, we observed that LbCas12a was very sensitive to imperfect base pairing

129

between the gRNA and the substrate, as any mismatch along the spacer reduced the

130

fluorescence output to near-background levels (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast,

131

AsCas12a and its variants were able to tolerate a mismatch 4nt from the 3’ end of the gRNA

132

(MM9). Furthermore, we found that enAsCas12a was the most tolerant to mismatches among

133

the five tested enzymes. Hence, our results suggest that enAsCas12a should be paired with

134

the N-Mam gRNA to safeguard against viral mutations or RNA editing at the target site.

136

Evaluation of RT-LAMP parameters

137
138

To enhance sensitivity, CRISPR-Cas detection is typically combined with an isothermal

139

amplification step, of which there are several options. Due to supply chain issues in the

140

ongoing pandemic, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-

141

LAMP)30 is the method-of-choice for COVID-19 applications. In the DETECTR assay, the

142

RT–LAMP reaction was performed at 62°C for 20–30 minutes15. Therefore, we first carried

143

out RT-LAMP at 62°C for 20 minutes on synthetic in vitro-transcribed (IVT) SARS-CoV-2

144

RNA templates and then used the amplified products in our fluorescence trans-cleavage assay

145

(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). For all the tested enzymes, the viral sequence was

146

consistently and clearly detected in every replicate when 20,000 or more copies of RNA were

147

used as input to RT-LAMP. However, in contrast to the published report15, when 2,000

148

copies of RNA were used in a 25μl RT-LAMP reaction (i.e. 80 copies per μl) instead, the

149

viral sequence was detected in only around half the replicates for all the Cas enzymes,

150

including LbCas12a.

151
152

Subsequently, we asked how the sensitivity of the CRISPR-based assay would be affected if

153

we varied the parameters of the LAMP reaction (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). When we

154

decreased the duration of LAMP from 20 to 12 minutes, we observed that the fluorescence

155

signal showed an exponential decay with every 10-fold reduction in RNA copy number,

156

indicating that the analytic limit of detection (LoD) became poorer if the amplification step

157

was performed for too short a period of time. Interestingly however, when we increased the

158

reaction temperature from 62oC to 65oC while keeping the duration at 12 minutes, we were

159

able to partially recover the fluorescence signal. Further increase in temperature from 65oC to

160

68oC caused a deterioration in the performance of our CRISPR-Dx (Supplementary Fig. 4).

161

Hence, our results suggest that 65oC is the optimal temperature for LAMP and that the

162

amplification reaction is sensitive to small variations in temperature.

163
164

Screening of additional gRNAs

165
166

We wondered if there may be other gRNAs that could yield a stronger fluorescence signal

167

than the N-Mam gRNA in our trans-cleavage assay. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains

168

two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, that encode multiple non-structural

169

proteins (nsps), four genes that encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein [S],

170

envelope protein [E], membrane protein [M], and nucleocapsid protein [N]), and several

171

accessory ORFs of unclear function (Fig. 3a)31. We aligned the genomes of SARS-CoV-2,

172

SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV and selected six additional target sites (O1, O2, S1, S2, S3, and

173

N1) that not only contained the necessary TTTV protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for

174

Cas12a but were also highly divergent between the three coronaviruses (Supplementary Fig.

175

5). We then analysed the collateral activities of our five Cas12a enzymes paired with each of

176

the six new gRNAs over the course of 30 minutes using synthetic DNA fragments of the

177

relevant genes as targets. Curiously, when the N1 gRNA was paired with either wildtype

178

AsCas12a or any of its engineered variants (enAsCas12a, enRR, and enRVR)29, we were able

179

to detect some fluorescence signal even in the absence of template (Fig. 3b and

180

Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that AsCas12a may be hyper-activated by certain gRNAs

181

in vitro without the need for it to cleave its intended target. Such a phenomenon was not

182

observed with LbCas12a.

183
184

Overall, the three S-gene gRNAs were able to generate similar or higher fluorescence signals

185

than the N-Mam gRNA with the appropriate Cas12a nuclease, while the two O-gene gRNAs

186

generally performed worse. In particular, in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 target, the

187

collateral activity of LbCas12a complexed with the S3 gRNA was approximately double that

188

of the same enzyme complexed with the N-Mam gRNA (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6).

189

There was no cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. We also confirmed that the

190

activity of our own purified protein was comparable to that of a commercially available

191

LbCas12a enzyme used in several recently announced CRISPR-based COVID-19 diagnostic

192

assays15,20,21 (Fig. 3c). Subsequently, we investigated the mismatch tolerance of LbCas12a at

193

the S3 target locus but found that collateral activity was greatly diminished for all the

194

mismatched (MM) gRNAs tested (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 7). Hence, although the

195

S3 gRNA may be used in a highly specific assay for known SARS-CoV-2 isolates, it is not

196

ideal for a diagnostic assay that is robust against potential mutations at the target site.

197
198

Detailed characterization of a new S-gene gRNA

199
200

Next, we turned our attention to the S2 gRNA. In the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 substrate,

201

this gRNA generated stronger fluorescence signals than the N-Mam gRNA when paired with

202

LbCas12a, AsCas12a, enAsCas12a, or enRVR (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig 8). The

203

engineered enAsCas12a enzyme exhibited the highest collateral activity with the S2 gRNA.

204

Importantly, no cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was observed regardless of

205

the Cas12a nuclease used. Furthermore, we found that the minimum spacer length for the S2

206

gRNA was 20nt, as shortening of the spacer reduced the collateral activity of all tested

207

nucleases, although unexpectedly, the 18nt gRNA gave higher fluorescence signals than the

208

19nt gRNA.

209
210

We sought to determine how mismatches at the S2 gRNA-substrate interface may affect the

211

collateral activity of the Cas12a enzymes. To this end, we generated ten additional gRNAs

212

with each harbouring a point mutation at different positions along the spacer (Fig. 4b).

213

Interestingly, we found from the trans-cleavage assay that individual mismatches at the S2

214

locus affected the collateral activity of all the Cas12a endonucleases much less than those at

215

the N-Mam locus (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 9). Nevertheless, enAsCas12a and enRVR

216

again exhibited the highest tolerance for mismatches, while wildtype LbCas12a was again the

217

most sensitive to imperfect base pairing between the gRNA and its target substrate.

218
219

So far, we had performed the CRISPR-Cas detection at room temperature (24oC) to simulate

220

a non-laboratory setting, but we wondered how the performance of our diagnostic assay

221

would improve if the detection was performed at the optimal temperature (37oC) of the

222

Cas12a enzymes instead. From the trans-cleavage assay, we observed that the fluorescence

223

signal increased approximately twice as fast at 37oC for all tested enzymes in the presence of

224

the intended SARS-CoV-2 template and reached significantly higher levels after 30 minutes

225

of reaction (P < 0.01, Student’s t-test) (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10). There was again

226

no cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In addition, the activity profile in the

227

presence of point mutations remained similar and in fact even improved slightly for all the

228

nucleases with respect to mismatch tolerance (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 10). Taken

229

together, our results indicate that our CRISPR-based assay should be performed at 37oC if a

230

faster test result is desired and also suggest that the S2 gRNA is more suitable than the N-

231

Mam gRNA in a diagnostic assay that guards against viral evolution or intracellular RNA

232

editing.

Multiplex Cas12a targeting

235
236

Besides searching for Cas-gRNA pairs that are not only specific for SARS-CoV-2 but are

237

also tolerant of mismatches at the binding site, another strategy to enhance robustness is to

238

incorporate two or more distinct gRNAs into the detection module. As a proof-of-concept, we

239

sought to buffer the collateral activity of LbCas12a, which appeared to be more sensitive to

240

imperfect base pairing at the gRNA-target interface than AsCas12a and its engineered

241

variants. Moreover, LbCas12a protein is commercially available and can be readily bought by

242

diagnostic laboratories that do not have the ability to purify their own enzymes. To keep all

243

the target sites within the same LAMP products, we may pair the S2 gRNA with either the S1

244

or the S3 gRNA, as both worked well with LbCas12a (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6). We

245

then tried to design LAMP primers using the online software PrimerExplorer V5. However,

246

we were unable to find any set of primers that would produce an amplicon smaller than

247

500bp that contained both the S2 and S3 loci. In contrast, many primer sets could be obtained

248

for S1 and S2. Hence, we decided to perform our multiplexed targeting experiments with the

249

S1 and S2 gRNAs.

250
251

Using a synthetic DNA fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene as substrate, we first assessed

252

the collateral activity of our five purified Cas12a enzymes when they were combined with

253

both the S1 and S2 gRNAs. All five nucleases exhibited robust activity with perfect matched

254

(PM) gRNAs (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 11). However, we noted that addition of the S1

255

gRNA caused a small but obvious reduction in the trans-cleavage activity of the three

256

AsCas12a variants, while that of LbCas12a remained approximately the same. This was

257

likely because the S1 gRNA would compete with the S2 gRNA for the Cas proteins but only

258

LbCas12a exhibited strong activity with the S1 gRNA (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6).

259

Subsequently, we profiled the activity of the Cas12a nucleases when the S1 PM gRNA was

260

used together with each one of the S2 MM gRNAs (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 11).

261

Strikingly, we now observed that LbCas12a exhibited the best overall tolerance for

262

mismatches, while AsCas12a and its engineered variants became more sensitive to the

263

mismatches.

264
265

Next, we sought to determine the analytic limit of detection (LoD) of our CRISPR-Dx. We

266

tested three sets of LAMP primers and found one set that amplified well even with low

267

amounts of template (Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore, we carried out RT-LAMP on

268

synthetic in vitro-transcribed (IVT) SARS-CoV-2 RNA templates using this selected primer

269

set. The reaction was performed at 65°C for 15 minutes because we had earlier found the

270

temperature to be optimal for LAMP and we sought to minimize the duration of our

271

diagnostic test. The amplified products were used immediately in our trans-cleavage assay,

272

with the fluorescence monitored over time in a microplate reader (Fig. 5 and Supplementary

273

Fig. 13). When only a single S2 PM gRNA was used, we found that the LoD was around 200

274

copies per reaction for all tested Cas12a nucleases. Expectedly, introduction of a single

275

mismatch (MM10) at the gRNA-substrate interface worsened the sensitivity of CRISPR-Cas

276

detection. More importantly, addition of a S1 PM gRNA was able to partially rescue the

277

mismatch at the S2 locus for LbCas12a, but not for the other Cas12a enzymes. Taken

278

together, our trans-cleavage assays revealed that the use of two gRNAs could increase the

279

robustness of CRISPR-Dx with respect to the presence of variant nucleotides, but care must

280

be taken to only utilize gRNAs that would work well together with the selected Cas nuclease.

281
282

Towards a point-of-care test

283
284

To broaden the use cases of our diagnostic assay, we sought to develop a portable point-of-

285

care test (POCT). After the CRISPR-Cas trans-cleavage reaction has taken place, the results

286

can be read out in different ways (Fig. 6a). While a microplate reader is useful for high

287

throughput screening of samples in a centralized facility, it is not amenable to non-laboratory

288

settings like ports of entry, workplaces, schools, public spaces, and homes. Hence, we

289

decided to visualize the results of our assay on a lateral flow strip (Supplementary Fig. 14).

290

Here, the reporter molecule consists of a fluorescent dye (fluorescein) linked to biotin by a

291

short piece of ssDNA. An anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated to gold binds to the dye on

292

the strip. When the viral substrate is absent, the reporter is intact and captured by streptavidin

293

at the control line. However, when the viral target is present, the reporter is cleaved and the

294

fluorescein-antibody complex migrates to the test line where it is captured by an immobilized

295

secondary antibody.

296
297

We performed the RT-LAMP reaction at 65oC for 15 minutes followed by the CRISPR-Cas

298

trans-cleavage reaction at 37oC for 10 minutes before adding a lateral flow strip to the

299

reaction tube. Bands appeared at either the test line or the control line within two minutes

300

(Fig. 6b). Hence, in total, the entire assay took slightly under 30 minutes to complete. Here,

301

we focused on LbCas12a to demonstrate the utility of multiplex targeting. The S2 gRNA (PM

302

or MM10) was used in the assay with or without a second S1 PM gRNA. We also tested

303

different copy numbers of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA template. Overall, we found that

304

our lateral flow assays gave results that mirrored those from a microplate reader. When the

305

S2 PM gRNA was used alone or in conjunction with the S1 PM gRNA, dark bands appeared

306

at the test line in the presence of at least 200 copies of template in the reaction mix.

307

Expectedly, without any multiplexing, introduction of a mismatch at the S2 gRNA-target

308

interface dramatically reduced the intensity of the test bands and worsened the analytic LoD

309

to 2,000 copies per reaction. Importantly, addition of the S1 PM gRNA was able to partially

310

restore the intensity of the test bands. Quantification of the test and control band intensities

311

further provided a more objective measure of whether the intended target was detected or not.

312

In the case of a mismatch at the S2 locus but perfect base pairing at the S1 locus, we were

313

able to tell that 200 copies per reaction gave a positive test result based on the ratio of the test

314

to control band intensities. In the future, a web or mobile phone application can be developed

315

to distinguish such borderline cases.

317

Discussion

318
319

There is an urgent healthcare need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for COVID-19.

320

What initially started as an infectious disease confined to Wuhan, China has since spread to

321

more than 200 countries worldwide within the span of a few months because SARS-CoV-2

322

has a high potential for human-to-human transmission and the majority of carriers are

323

asymptomatic or only mildly ill. At present, qRT-PCR serves as the gold standard for viral

324

detection, with dozens of test kits available in the market. However, the method requires

325

dedicated instrumentation and trained operators and also has a slow turnaround time. Hence,

326

there is still an unmet need for a rapid, sensitive, specific, and affordable SARS-CoV-2

327

diagnostic assay, which is essential for stopping viral spread and for the safe reopening of

328

economies and schools.

329
330

CRISPR-Dx has the potential to meet society’s need for such a diagnostic test. The entire

331

workflow consists of four main modules (Fig. 6a). First is the sample input. Although

332

purified RNA is ideal for performance, the process of RNA extraction will take up precious

333

time, increase cost, and stress the supply chain. Therefore, there is great interest in

334

developing assays that can directly handle patient samples, including nasopharyngeal swabs

335

and saliva. The second module is the isothermal amplification step, which is commonly

336

implemented to enhance the sensitivity of CRISPR-Dx. LAMP30 is the method-of-choice in

337

the current pandemic climate, as its reagents are readily available from several suppliers, but

338

other approaches can also be used, including recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)32

339

and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA)33. The third module is the CRISPR-Cas

340

detection system. Most CRISPR-Dx rely on an indiscriminate collateral activity possessed by

341

some Cas nucleases, including Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 family members. Lastly, the fourth

342

module is the assay readout. While our work here has demonstrated the use of a microplate

343

reader (for high-throughput testing) and a lateral flow strip (for POCT), another possibility is

344

a graphene-based field-effect transistor, whose high sensitivity has been reported to obviate

345

the need for a pre-amplification step34. Overall, the cost of running a CRISPR-based test per

346

sample is under S$9 (Table 2), which is around US$6.40 or €5.80 and is similar to that of an

347

off-the-shelf pregnancy test. The bulk of the cost comes from the LAMP mastermix and the

348

dipstick.

349
350

While promising, current CRISPR-Dx assays for COVID-19 (Table 1) have not taken into

351

account viral evolution and RNA editing. Alarmingly, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome

352

have been observed at the target sites of multiple existing qRT-PCR diagnostic tests27.

353

Moreover, RNA editing mediated by the ADAR and APOBEC enzymes can also impact

354

upon the performance of COVID-19 diagnostics. Hence, in this work, we sought to bolster

355

the robustness of CRISPR-Dx against unexpected variant nucleotides introduced by

356

evolutionary pressures or RNA editing. Starting from the DETECTR platform9,15, we tested

357

several different natural and engineered Cas12a enzymes and found that enAsCas12a

358

exhibited the highest tolerance for single mismatches at the gRNA-target interface.

359

Importantly, high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 was still maintained with enAsCas12a, as no

360

cross-reactivity for two other closely related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was

361

observed. We also screened additional gRNAs and discovered that all the tested nucleases,

362

except enRR, exhibited higher trans-cleavage activity with the S2 gRNA than with the N-

363

Mam gRNA. Hence, our results indicate that enCas12a complexed with the S2 gRNA will

364

serve as a more sensitive and robust SARS-CoV-2 detection system than the published

365

LbCas12a and N-Mam gRNA pair. Nevertheless, we are mindful that enCas12a is not yet a

366

commercially available enzyme. Hence, we demonstrated that a multiplex targeting strategy

367

could also be utilized to enhance the robustness of CRISPR-Dx. For example, the LbCas12a

368

nuclease, which is readily bought, may be combined with both the S1 and S2 gRNAs to

369

increase the robustness of viral detection.

370
371

We note that diagnostic assays can be constructed out of isothermal amplification methods

372

alone without coupling them to a separate CRISPR-Cas detection module. Such assays

373

typically rely on the use of a turbidimeter to measure the extent of magnesium precipitation,

374

labelled primers, or special dyes that sense pH changes, react with amplification by-products,

375

or bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Due to their relative simplicity, over a dozen

376

LAMP-only diagnostic assays for COVID-19 have been developed so far35-49. However,

377

isothermal amplification frequently produces spurious non-specific products, which can give

378

rise to false positive results. Although this problem may be circumvented by the use of a

379

sequence-specific detection probe that is distinct from the LAMP primers43, the probe itself is

380

not involved in any amplification process. In contrast, CRISPR-Dx confers two distinct

381

rounds of specificity. The first round comes from primer-specific isothermal amplification

382

such as LAMP, while the second round comes from gRNA-specific Cas detection.

383

Furthermore, the CRISPR-Cas detection system is also capable of signal amplification

384

because each hyperactivated Cas nuclease can proceed to cleave numerous reporter

385

molecules. Hence, CRISPR-Dx can function like a photomultiplier tube and the assay

386

duration can potentially be shortened if all the reagents are in a single-pot and the conditions

387

are optimal for every reaction.

388
389

In conclusion, CRISPR-Dx can serve as a rapid, specific, sensitive, and affordable approach

390

for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our work here has further provided two different strategies,

391

namely the use of enCas12a and multiplex targeting, to enhance the robustness of the assay.

392

It can be implemented in a high-throughput format through the use of a microplate reader or

393

deployed as a POCT through the use of a lateral flow strip to enable us to halt viral

394

transmission and reopen our society safely.

Plasmids and oligonucleotides

401

The pET28b-T7-Cas12a-NLS-6xHis expression plasmids were gifts from Keith Joung and

402

Benjamin Kleinstiver (Addgene plasmid #114069 [AsCas12a], #114070 [LbCas12a],

403

#114072 [enAsCas12a], #114075 [enRVR], and #114077 [enRR])29. DNA oligonucleotides,

404

custom reporters for the trans-cleavage assays, and gene fragments (ORF1AB, S, and N) for

405

the three coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were synthesised by

Cas12a expression and purification

410

The Cas12a expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and

411

stored as glycerol stocks. Starter cultures were grown in LB broth with 50µg/ml kanamycin at

412

37°C for 16h and diluted 1:50 into 400ml LB-kanamycin broth until an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 was

413

reached. Cultures were then induced with 1mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside

414

(IPTG) and incubated at 25°C for another 16h. Subsequently, cells were harvested by

415

centrifugation at 3,220g for 20min and resuspended in lysis buffer [50mM HEPES, 500mM

416

NaCl, 2mM MgCl2, 20mM imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM DTT, 0.005mg/ml lysozyme

417

(Vivantis), 1X Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific)], followed by

418

sonication at high power for 10 cycles of 30s ON/OFF (Bioruptor Plus; Diagenode). Lysates

419

were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g for 15min. The supernatants were pooled, loaded

420

onto a gravity flow column packed with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), and rotated for 2h at 4°C.

421

The column was washed twice with 5ml wash buffer (50mM Tris, 300mM NaCl and 30mM

422

imidazole). Five elutions were performed with 500µl elution buffer (50mM Tris, 300mM

423

NaCl, and 200mM imidazole) and analysed by SDS-PAGE. The final gel filtration step was

424

performed with a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200pg column (GE Healthcare) on a fast protein

425

liquid chromatography purification system (ÄKTA Explorer; GE Healthcare), which was

426

eluted with storage buffer (50mM Tris, 300mM NaCl, and 1mM DTT). Fractions containing

427

Cas12a were collected, analysed by SDS-PAGE, and concentrated to around 500µl with

428

Vivaspin 20, 50,000 MWCO concentrator units (Sartorius). Glycerol was added to a final

429

concentration of 20%. Protein concentrations were measured with the Quick Start Bradford

436

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

437

(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) using default settings. Potential target sites (20nt

438

spacers) in the ORF1AB, S, and N genes were selected from non-conserved regions

439

containing a TTTV PAM. Potential targets were filtered after a specificity check on BLASTn

440

(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to remove non-specific candidates. Truncated

In vitro transcription (IVT) of gRNAs

444

Templates for gRNA synthesis were designed with the following sequence order: T7

445

promoter-Cas12a scaffold-spacer. Top strand DNA oligos consisting of the T7 promoter (5’-

446

TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3’) and scaffold (5’-TAATTTCTACTCTTGTAGAT-3’ for

447

AsCas12a and its variants; 5’-AATTTCTACTAAGTGTAGAT-3’ for LbCas12a) were

448

annealed to the bottom strand and extended by Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB).

449

IVT of the dsDNA products was performed with the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA

450

Synthesis kit (NEB) at 37oC overnight. Following DNase I digestion, gRNAs were purified

451

with the RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (ZYMO Research), analysed by 2% TAE-agarose

452

gel electrophoresis to assess RNA integrity, measured with NanoDrop 2000, and stored at -

TOPO PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen) and their sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing.

458

The vectors were used as templates for PCR with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB)

459

and the products were gel extracted and purified with the PureNA Biospin Gel Extraction kit

460

(Research Instruments). DNA concentrations were measured using NanoDrop 2000 and all

461

the DNA samples were stored at 4°C. To generate RNA templates for RT-LAMP assays, the

Fluorescence trans-cleavage assay

467

Cas ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were pre-assembled with 65nM AsCas12a/

468

LbCas12a, 195nM gRNA, and 200nM custom ssDNA fluorophore-quencher (FQ) reporter in

469

reaction buffer (1X NEBuffer 3.1 plus 0.4mM DTT) for 30 minutes at room temperature.

470

Subsequently, the cleavage reaction was initiated by adding 3nM DNA template

471

(approximately 1E11 copies) to a total volume of 50µl and then transferred to a 96-well

472

microplate (Costar). Fluorescence intensities were measured with either the Infinite M1000

473

Pro (Tecan) or the Spectramax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices) for 30 minutes at room

474

temperature, with measurement intervals of 5 minutes (λex: 485 nm; λem: 535 nm).

475
476

RT-LAMP reaction

477

Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA templates were serially diluted and amplified by RT-LAMP

478

using the WarmStart LAMP Kit (NEB). LAMP primers were added to a final concentration

479

of 0.2µM for F3 and B3, 1.6µM for FIP and BIP, and 0.8µM for LF and LB. The optimal

480

temperature for RT-LAMP was found to be 65°C. Subsequently, 4μl RT-LAMP products

481

were used as templates for the trans-cleavage assay, instead of 3nM PCR-amplified DNA

482

template.

483
484

Lateral flow readout

485

500nM of custom ssDNA biotin reporter was used instead of the FQ reporter. The Cas12a

486

detection reaction was performed at 37oC for 10 minutes. Subsequently, 50μL HybriDetect

487

assay buffer (Milenia Biotec) was added to the reaction and a HybriDetect (Milenia Biotec)

488

dipstick was inserted directly into the solution in an upright position. The dipstick was

489

incubated in the reaction for 2 minutes at room temperature before inspection.

549

cleavage reaction. Data represent mean ± s.e.m. (62oC for 20min: n = 4-7 biological

b Fluorescence measurements using a microplate reader after 30 minutes of cleavage reaction.

560

1E11 copies of the relevant DNA target were present in a 50μl reaction. All the readings were

561

normalized to the negative control (NTC) at the start of the experiment. The N1 gRNA gave

562

an unexpected result, whereby it triggered the collateral activity of AsCas12a and its variants

563

even in the absence of a template. Data represent mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3-6 biological replicates).

570

The fluorescence measurements were taken after 30 minutes of cleavage reaction using a

571

microplate reader and all the readings were normalized to the NTC at the start of the

572

experiment. Our results indicate that LbCas12a should be paired with the S3 gRNA instead of

573

the N-Mam gRNA if a diagnostic assay that is highly specific for known SARS-CoV-2

574

isolates is desired. Data represent mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3 biological replicates).

578

reaction at 24oC. 1E11 copies of DNA template corresponding to one of the three

579

coronaviruses (see colour bar) were present in a 50μl reaction. Spacers of three different

580

lengths targeting the S2 locus were tested. All the measurements were normalized to the

581

negative control (NTC) at the 0min timepoint. No cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV or MERS-

582

CoV was detected. Unexpectedly, the 18nt spacer yielded higher fluorescence than the 19nt

583

spacer for all the tested nucleases, especially LbCas12a. Data represent mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3-

584

4 biological replicates).

d Fluorescence measurements for a single S2 gRNA after 30 minutes of trans-cleavage

592

reaction at 37oC. There was still no cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV at the

593

higher temperature, but the fluorescence signal for SARS-CoV-2 was approximately twice as

594

high. Data represent mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3 biological replicates).

598

37oC and 0 is the background signal for NTC at the start of the experiment. The most

599

detrimental mismatch position appears to be 2nt from the PAM-distal end (MM10).

f Fluorescence measurements for two PM gRNAs (S1 and S2) after 30 minutes of cleavage

601

reaction at 37oC. No cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was observed. Data

performed at 65oC for 15 minutes. The Cas detection reaction was then carried out at 37oC,

610

with the fluorescence measurements here taken after 10 minutes using a microplate reader.

a Overview of a prototypical CRISPR-Dx workflow. While a microplate reader can allow up

615

to 96 samples to be processed at once, it is not amenable to point-of-care testing. In contrast,

616

a lateral flow strip proves a simple visual readout akin to an off-the-shelf pregnancy test.

b Detection of SARS-CoV-2 sequence using gRNAs targeting the S-gene. Different copies of

618

synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were used as input to the RT-LAMP reaction, which

619

was performed at 65oC for 15 minutes. Next, the Cas detection reaction was carried out at

620

37oC for 10 minutes before a dipstick was added to each reaction tube. The bands on the

621

dipstick appeared by 2 minutes. In total, the VaNGuard assay was completed in under 30

622

minutes.
