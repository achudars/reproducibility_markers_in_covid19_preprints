In Silico Modeling of Virus Particle Propagation and
Infectivity along the Respiratory Tract: A Case Study for
SARS-COV-2

Abstract
Respiratory viruses including Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus and cornaviruses
such as Middle Eastern respiratory virus (MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 infect and cause serious and
sometimes fatal disease in thousands of people annually. It is critical to understand virus propagation dynamics within the respiratory system because new insights will increase our understanding of
virus pathogenesis and enable infection patterns to be more predictable in vivo, which will enhance
targeting of vaccines and drug delivery. This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch
structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air
flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. The model can also consider the impact
of the immune response aim to inhibit virus replication and spread. The model was applied to
the SARS-CoV-2 virus by integrating data on its life-cycle, as well as density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) expressing cells along the respiratory tract network. Using physiological
data associated with the respiratory rate and virus load that is inhaled, the model can improve our
understanding of the concentration and spatiotemporal dynamics of virus.

Introduction

Respiratory viruses are among the most transmissable viruses in the world and create a global health
burden that contributes to thousands of illnesses and deaths annually. According to the American
Center for Disease Control (CDC), influenza has killed between 12,000 and 61,000 people annually and caused approximately 460,000 hospitalisations per year in the United States. Respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) is is estimated to cause close to 33 million cases of respiratory disease each
year globally, with approximately 3 million hospitalisations [1]. Currently, the world is grappling
with a major pandemic caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that also targets the lungs, has infected many millions of people, killed approximately 700,000 thus far and has caused unprecedented
upheaval to the world, both socially and economically.
Once a respiratory virus enters the nose or mouth, it can move down the throat towards the
lungs but much of the virus will deposit on the walls of the upper respiratory tract and infect cells
along the way, leading to amplification of the initial virus load. The dispersion of virus particles
throughout the respiratory system (i.e., the virus load along the respiratory tract) depends on
the respiratory pattern (i.e., inlet airflow rate), the concentration of virus particles in the inhaled
air, also known as exposure level, and the distance that they can travel through the respiratory
system. In addition, the bifurcation geometry of the airway as well as the distribution of cell surface
receptors that the virus can bind to also change the virus dispersion along the respiratory tract. For
example, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus is known to use the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme
(ACE2) receptor to bind to and enter cells [2]. Therefore, the density of ACE2-expressing cells in

Figure 1: Computational model for exploring the evolution of viral propagation dynamics down the
branch generation of the respiratory tract. The computational model considers the virus deposition
and distribution of host cell density along the airway and their role in proliferating the virus to
characterize the variability in viral concentration dynamics along the respiratory tract (the airway
network figure used in this diagram is adapted from science photo)
the respiratory tract is a critical factor in the distribution of virus. Since cells expressing ACE2 are
not spread evenly throughout the respiratory system, the areas that are expressing ACE2 are more
vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus creating a heterogeneous concentration distribution across
the respiratory system. The virus concentration at any point in the respiratory system, therefore,
will depend on the replication location as well as replication rate, which can result in either further
propagation into the airway or potential transmission to other individuals through exhalation [3].
The evolution of the infection and the spreading pattern along the respiratory system can be
characterized and predicted effectively if the viral concentration dynamics (i.e., virus propagation,
deposition, infection and reproduction) can be characterized using modeling and simulations along
with critical parameters that influence the system. This knowledge can provide new tools to improve personalized patient care, and support biotechnological and pharmaceutical research to design
effective therapeutic drugs. From a personalization perspective, by being able to predict how the
virus will impact a patient based on known criteria, medical staff will be more able to make timely,
informed and accurate decisions to prevent development of severe symptoms that can worsen the
patient’s condition. In the Pharmaceutical industry, this model can benefit the development of
drugs by, for example, allowing the in silico screening and characterization of inhibitory drugs prior
to costly in vivo trials.
The main aim of this study was to develop a generic computational model for characterizing
the dynamics and the evolution of infectious respiratory diseases along the respiratory tract. First,
the model integrates biophysical models of virus propagation and deposition within an airway flow
system as well as infection properties such as the host cell distribution and virus replication process.
Second, we formulate the virus concentration levels along the branches of the respiratory tract.
Moreover, the model also accounts for virus dispersion along the respiratory tract that can be
impacted by factors such as the respiratory rate, viral exposure levels (i.e., the quantity of virus
that is inhaled) and the virus particle size. Integrating these together, the computational model
explores the changes in the virus propagation as it encounters advection-diffusion based air flow,
before turning into pure diffusion towards the end of the lungs (e.g., alveoli regions). In the virus

infection process, the study also considers the impact of the immune system and how it impacts on
the overall concentration of the virus within the respiratory tract. The study uses SARS-CoV-2 as
a case study to present how the derived model could be used to characterize the virus propagation
dynamics in humans. The main contributions of this study are as follows:
1. Development of a temporal viral concentration model that can be used to analyze changes in
virus dynamics as virus particles propagate along the branches of the airway in the respiratory
system. This is achieved by accounting for the generation branching geometry of the respiratory
tract, and integrating models of the air flow that affects to viral deposition and replication,
and its impact on the virus spread distribution along the airway generations.
2. Model the variability in spatial and temporal dynamics of the virus particle evolution within
the respiratory tract, by considering personalized patient parameters such as the breathing
rate and dynamic viral pleomorphic size change, with respect to the variability in inhaled
dosage.
3. Sensitivity analysis of the viral propagation along the generation branches considering factors
such as the exposure level as well as the immune response.

Methods

The main steps in the process of deriving the computational model for the virus propagation dynamics along the respiratory tract are illustrated in Fig. 1. There are three main elements to the
model include the concentration dynamics based on particle deposition, virus propagation under
advection-diffusion air flow over the respiratory airways and the impact from the infection process
(complete derivation of each of these processes are provided in the Supplementary Information (SI)
4.4).

2.1

Respiratory Tract Generation Model and Virus Concentration Dynamics

Fig. 2 depicts the respiratory airway generation structure that is used in our study to characterize
the viral particles concentration and its distribution along the respiratory tract. The respiratory
generation model in our study is taken from the study in [4] and includes the real physiological
parameters, such as the diameter and length of each airway generation, and their values are provided
in Table 1. The concentration of the viral particle in the ith airway generation, CGi , will depend
on the quantity of virus that is in the previous airway generation (i.e., CGi−1 ). This means that
the virus infection level (or the virus concentration) of the Gi airway generation depends on the
virus infection level of the airway generation Gi−1 and its propagation along the branch. Moreover,
the viral particle deposition rate and the virus reproduction speed in the host cells along with the
respiratory system geometry such as the airway length and diameter also contributes to the virus
infection level.
By taking these factors into account, this section presents how the advection-diffusion mechanism
of the virus particle propagation can be utilized to compute the concentration over an airway generation Gi . When the virus particles travel down the respiratory tract under the advection-diffusion
mechanisms, they deposit on the airway walls and bind onto ACE2-expressing cells to initiate infection and subsequently the replication process. Considering the viral infection and replication process
depicted in Fig. 2 and the mass balance of the virus particles in the control volume, the change in
the virus concentration Gi , where i represents an airway generation, is represented as

Virus Propagation over the Airways

In order to calculate air flow velocity u required to determine the virus concentration in Eq. 3 along
the airway generation branches, we take into account the bifurcation transformation between the
large airways that separates into smaller branches with reduced lengths and diameters as illustrated
in Fig. 1. Suppose an airway of length L0 branches into left and right branches of length Ll 1 and

Lr 1 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Based on the conservation of air flow, at the first bifurcation (i.e., G0 ),
the conditions QL0 ,out = QLl1 ,in + QLr1 ,in and PL0 ,out = PLl1 ,in = PLr1 ,in holds at the bifurcation
junction; where Q is the flow rate, P is the pressure, Ll1 and Lr1 are respectively the lengths of
the left (l) and right (r) branches, and the numbers l and r refers to the airway generation number.
In addition, the subscript in and out stands for the inlet and outlet of the branch. When air flows
down the airway, there is a drop in pressure as well as resistance against the air flow. We adapt
these properties and model the flow using transmission line circuit theory, where its equivalence
is voltage drop in response to changes in the current flow [5]. Hence, following the concepts from
transmission line theory, the impedance (Z) at the outlet of the parent airway (ZL0 ,out ) is related
to the impedance at the inlet of the branching airways as ZL 1,out = ZL 1 ,in + ZL 1 ,in . This results in

the impedance at the inlet being expressed as ZL0 ,in = ZL0 + ZL0 ,out , where ZL0 is the impedance
of the airway ( 4.4 for the derivation of ZL0 ). Based on this, the inlet air flow rates to the branches

To compute the airflow rates, as well as the velocity profiles over the respiratory tract, we use a
backward calculation procedures, which starts with the impedance at the outlet of the last airway
(i.e., 23rd generation’s Z(Ll23 ,out) and Z(Lr23 ,out) as represented in Fig. 2). As an example, the
procedure for the 23rd and 22nd generation airflow rate is as follows:
1. The impedance of the 23rd airway generation, Z23 , as well as the impedance at the inlet of
this airway, Z(23,in) , is computed (see SI for formulas 4.4).
2. The impedance at the outlet of the 22nd airway generation, Z(22,out) is then computed based
on the impedance values of step 1 (23rd generation).
3. Step 1 is repeated to compute the impedance of the 22nd airway generation, Z22 , as well as
the impedance at the inlet, Z(22,in) .
These steps are repeated up to the initial airway generation ( i.e., ZG0 as represented in Fig. 2
) to compute the impedance of each airway generations. Then, the flow rate Q into each airway
generation is computed using Eqns. 4 and 5. Having derived the flow rate into the airway, the
air flow velocity u is then computed using the expression Q = Au, where A = π(dL /2)2 is the
cross sectional area of the airway of diameter dL . The real physiological parameters, length (L) and
diameter of the airway generations (dL ) given in Table 1 (taken from [4]) are used for computing
the air flow velocity of each airway generation.
The air enters into the respiratory tract under external forces that includes both turbulence
as well as gravity, and the impact of these forces gradually decreases once we go deeper into the
lung. Hence, the propagation of particles contained in the airflow can be determined using the

advection-diffusion property [6]. The advection mechanism is the dominant force that facilitates
the propagation of particles and their deposition along the upper airways due to the high airflow
velocity, which in turn, causes turbulence in the airflow. This differs from the lower branches within
the respiratory track, which is dominated largely by pure diffusion.
2.2.1

Particle deposition rate

The virus deposition (k) mainly takes place under three main mechanisms, impaction (kI ), sedimentation (kS ) and diffusion (kD ). Hence, the final particle deposition rate k is computed as the sum
of all deposition rates and is represented as
k = kI + kS + kD .

(8)

Details for kI , kS and kD are as follows ([4], [7], [8]):
1. Impaction (kI ): Virus deposition due to impaction takes place in response to virus particles
which cannot flow evenly along their trajectory due to their inertia and surroundings. These
barriers increases with particle size and flow rate and mostly occurs in the upper airways due
to high velocity. In our study, we use the following formula to compute kI [4].
kI =

1.3 ρp d2p u
,
L 18µdL

(9)

where L is the airway length, ρp is the virus particle density, dp is the virus particle diameter,
µ is the air viscosity and dL is the airway diameter.
2. Sedimentation (kS ): Sedimentation occurs when the virus particles move under the gravitational force, and they settle on the lower surface of the airways in the upper respiratory
region, and is computed as [4]
kS =

(10)

and ug is the settling velocity of the virus particles.

Settling velocity is known as the maximum velocity that a virus particle can achieve (i.e.,
velocity of a particle when the total external forces acting on it becomes zero). Fig. 3 depicts
a virus particle of mass m, diameter dp and density ρp experiencing an airflow of density
ρf and velocity uf at t = 0 and then propagates down with velocity up under three forces,
which includes external gravity, drag and buoyancy. When the virus particle achieves its
settling velocity ug at t = T after traveling LT distance, the particle moves at an arbitrary
time t, where its relative velocity (velocity with respect to the airflow) can be expressed as
up,t = uf − up . The forces (external force Fe , drag force FD , and buoyancy force Fb ) acting
on the particle, shown in Fig. 3, Eqn. 11 is derived by applying Newton’s second law, which
is used to determine the settling velocity ug , and is represented as follows:

where CD is the drag coefficient, Cc is the slipping coefficient, g is the acceleration of gravity

Virus infection process

In the event of a virus infection, SARS-Cov-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, enabling entry into a
number of different cells found in the respiratory tracts (e.g., tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells,
type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages) [9]. The infection also stimulates increase in ACE2 expression
and this in turn accelerates the virus infection process. In addition, the viral infection triggers
the transcription of interferon stimulated genes which impact on the viral reproduction as well as
as promoting an inflammatory response [10] and this is followed by cellular apoptosis in response
to the infection. Based on previous studies related to the infection of diseases such as HIV and
influenza [11], the basic model used to describe this viral infection process is given in Eqn.14-16.
This model expresses the inter-relationship between the ACE2-expressed cells (A) (also generally
known as susceptible cells), infected cells (I) and virus (C), and is represented as

and c (day−1 ) are the virus production rate and clearing rates, respectively. In this study, the
solution of this system of equations expresses the change in A, C and I concentrations over time
and is derived numerically by using Ordinary Differential Equation Solvers(ODE) [12].
Finally, the airflow velocity u, the virus deposition rate k and the virus replication rate p computed respectively using Eqns. 4-7, Eqn. 8 and Eqns. 14-16 are used to determine the virus
concentration in each airway generation CGi (i = 0, 1, · · · , 23) by using Eqn. 3.

Results

This section mainly presents the spatial and temporal viral dynamics over the respiratory tract.
The computational outcomes presented below are generated by using the parameter values listed in
Table 2, unless otherwise mentioned for specific analysis. In our results analysis, the impact of the
airflow rate and flow velocity on the deposition of viral particles on the airway walls is explored.
The virus infection process based on the deposition process is studied and this is followed by the
propagation dynamics of the viral particles along the respiratory tract. Finally, this analysis explores
the impact of several parameters such as the respiratory rate, immune response and exposure level
on the dynamic propagation of virus particles through the respiratory tract.

3.1

Virus propagation through the respiratory tract

In exploring the virus propagation along the respiratory tract, one of the most critical insights
required is the change in airflow along the airway generations starting from the trachea to the
alveolar regions. Here, we used the derived model in Eqn. 4 to compute the airflow rate and the
velocity in each airway generation by using real physiological parameters such as the length and
diameter of the airway generations [4]. Fig. 4a shows both the change in the airflow rate and
velocity over the 23 generations when air enters through the nose or mouth at a rate of 30 lmin−1 .
The airflow rate reduces to nearly half its value as it progresses into higher airway generations due
to the bifurcation of larger airways that are separated into smaller branches. The velocity shown in
Fig. 4a also reduces with higher airway generations. This validates our belief stated in the previous
section, that the dominant force that propagates the virus into the lungs is governed by the advection
and diffusion process, and in particular in the upper and lower parts of the respiratory system. Fig.
4b depicts the virus deposition under sedimentation and impaction, and shows again that this is
higher in the upper airways, while the particle deposition due to diffusion increases with increasing
airway generation number.
The virus shape is pleomorphic (i.e., changes shape) and is predominantly elliptical or spherical.
Therefore, we also analyzed the impact of the virus particle shape and its propagation through the
respiratory system based on changes in its diameter between 60–140 nm [14]. In terms of velocity and
deposition, Fig. 5a(I − IV ) and Fig. 5b(I − IV ) depicts the impact of variability in the inlet airflow
rate (Q0 = 15 − 60lmin−1 ) on the airflow velocity and virus deposition through the respiratory

system. The results show that the velocity of the virus particles as well as their deposition rate
k increases over the airway generations with increasing inlet airflow rate (i.e., increasing breathing
rate). It can be observed further that the variability in the virus deposition rate over the first 15
airway generations is considerably higher compared to the airway generations in the alveolar region.

3.2

Virus Concentration Dynamics Along the Airways

To understand the virus concentration dynamics as it flows along the airways, our analysis assumes a
virus concentration of 107 Copies/ml (or Infectious particles/ml) entering the respiratory tract (i.e.,
C0 ) at a breathing airflow rate Q0 = 30lmin−1 . In addition, we also assume the alveolar type-II and
epithelial cell density that express ACE2 is higher around the mouth, nose and alveolar [6]. The
higher quantity is achieved by deriving ACE2 concentration for each airways generation from the
Gaussian distribution, where we averaged higher ACE2 expression (∼ 6 − 7 Copies/ml) around the
trachea and alveolar (i.e., ∼ 1 − 2 and ∼ 21 − 23 airway generations) compared to the other airway
generations (∼ 4 − 5Copies/ml), but with the same variance.
Fig. 6(I) shows the variability in the virus concentration computed using Eqn. 3, while Fig.
6(II) depicts the change in ACE2 expression levels over the airway generations. It can be observed
that the abundance of virus is higher in the upper airways (e.g., trachea) compared to the high
generations that are deep into the lungs. This aligns with the clinical observation that the possibility
of initial infection is highly likely around the mouth, nose and throat [2]. Fig. 6(III) presents a
simulated end-to-end concentration evolution of the virus over a number of days to illustrate the
effects of the infection and replication process once the virus has been deposited into the airway.
This concentration evolution is based on Eqn. 14. Our results shows that the levels of the virus
concentration reaches its peak, on average, within 5-7 days after the initial infection, and reduces
as the immune response aggressively impacts on the virus. This prediction is in line with clinical
observations discussed in the study in [17]. Thus, Fig. 6(III) justifies the need for self-isolation
between 7-14 days post-infection as the virus concentration would be at its highest during this
period, which increases the probability of onward transmission.
The insights observed from Fig. 6(I − III) provide greater understanding of the virus deposition
and infection process, and subsequently the variability in virus concentration over time. These virus
concentration dynamics, however, will vary from person to person depending on a number of factors
such as strength of the immune response, respiratory rate and strength, pre-existing conditions,
lung airway branching structure and density of cells expressing ACE2. Therefore, to understand
the impact of some of these factors, the study further explored the impact of the immune response
(Fig. 7a), ACE2 expression distribution (Fig. 7b), and airflow rate (Fig. 7c) on changes to the
virus load along the respiratory tract. Fig. 7a shows that the virus load decreases with increasing
immune response and in particular at the lower generation levels of the respiratory track. In the case
of a low immune response level, the concentration of virus still decreases moving through the lung

generation levels until the highest generations where concentrations rise steeply. This is the deep
region of the respiratory tracks in the alveolar region that contains high density of ACE2 expressed
cells. This shows the virus particles that have not been blocked properly by the immune system, will
propagate deeper into the lungs and replicate at a high rate, and addresses the case of patients with
low immune system who struggle to combat the virus. Fig. 7b depicts that the greater expression
of ACE2 also has a significant influence on increasing the spread of virus load over the respiratory
tract, where we see that ACE2-expressed cells that are evenly spread throughout the respiratory
track will result in high concentration. However, low density of ACE2-expressed cells that are in the
high airway generation branches of the lung will result in a low concentration of virus, largely due
to the minimum opportunities for cell entry by the virus. Fig. 7c shows that the increasing air flow
rate will cause an increasing in virus concentration though, it does not exhibit a noticeable impact
on the distribution of viral concentration over the respiratory tract.

3.3

Temporal Variability in Virus Load Over the Respiratory System

As presented in Fig. 6, the virus concentration dynamic starts as soon as the viral particles enter
into the airways and start the infection process. Subsequently, the infected cells contribute to the
virus concentration while the hosts innate immune system seeks to inhibit it creating a dynamically
changing virus concentration environment. This process will evolve over time, with initial dose of
virus as well as the effectiveness of the immune response being key influencers of the outcome. Assuming that there is constant virus reproduction and immune response rate throughout the airway
generations, Fig. 8 represents the change in the virus load along the respiratory tract over time. As
observed in this graph, the time to reach the peak virus load increases with the airway generations.
The virus will continuously flow downwards into the lower parts of the respiratory tract, thus amplifying any replication that is taking place in the lung. Moreover, the virus load decreases after
reaching the peak as susceptible cells reduces and the immune response increases. In addition, Fig.
5 in the SI 4.4 shows the variability in the virus load per airway generation in the respiratory tract.

3.4

Impact of Airflow Rate, Immune Response and Exposure Level on
the Temporal Virus Concentration Dynamics

Eqn. 2 and 14 accounts for the impact of a number of parameters that could make a significant
impact on the temporal virus concentration dynamics in the respiratory track. We have mentioned
earlier that the spatial impact of these parameters on the spread of virus over the various levels of
generation branches will vary from person to person, depending on different personal parameters.

Figure 8: Variability in the virus load in the respiratory airway generations over time, given that
the initial airflow rate is Q0 = 30lmin−1 , virus particle diameter dp = 70nm, and virus exposure
quantity in contact is C0 = 107 Copies/ml.
To explore the impact of these parameters on the changing temporal viral dynamics, Fig. 9
presents the variability in the temporal virus behavior with respect to the change in three selected
parameters, which are the inlet flow rate (Q0 ), immune response rate (d) and virus exposure level
(C0 ). Fig. 9a(I − III) depict the change in the virus load over time for increasing three immune
response d and flow rate Q values, while the virus exposure level C0 is fixed to 108 Copies/ml. Fig.
9b(I −III) present the temporal virus behavior with respect to the change in the virus exposure level
C0 and inlet airflow rate Q0 for fixed immune response of 4day −1 , and Fig. 9c(I − III) depict the
impact of the virus exposure level and immune response on the dynamic virus concentration levels
along the respiratory tract when the airflow rate is 30lmin−1 (the exposure level C0 is presented
in log10 scale). Comparing Fig. 9a(I) with Fig. 9a(III), it can be observed that the spread of
virus along the respiratory tract is higher for low immune response, whereas Fig. 9b(I − III) depict
that the chance of the virus propagating down the respiratory tract is high with high virus exposure
level. However, in both cases the breathing rate Q0 does not seem to have a significant impact on the
change in virus load. For instance, the virus load is nearly higher than 105 Copies/ml only in the
first few airway generations (∼ 0-3 generations) when the initial exposure is 101 0Copies/ml and the
inlet airflow rate is 15 lmin−1 in Fig. 9b(I). However, when the initial exposure is 104 Copies/ml
and the inlet airflow rate is 60 lmin−1 as presented in Fig. 9b(III), the virus load is nearly around
105 Copies/ml in most of the airway generations. Considering the impact of the immune response
d along with the exposure level C0 on the temporal behavior of the virus in the airways, Fig.
9c(I − III) shows that although the virus load that propagates down the airways decreases with
higher immune response, the exposure level has a considerable impact on increasing the level of
the virus load that propagates down the respiratory tract. Therefore, based on the temporal virus
propagation presented in Fig. 9 and despite an increase in the inlet airflow rate Q0 , the exposure
level C0 and higher immune response d can have a high influence on the spread of the virus deep

these parameters on the virus behavior in the respiratory tract, please see Fig. 6 in the SI 4.4.

Impact of Effective Dose

Effective exposure level that is required for initiating the infection is still a debatable factor due
to the lack of clinical evidence. The computational model investigated in this study based on the

13

different exposure levels (C0 ) and immune response d values over a period of 30 days given that

d = 10−5 ).
model in Eqn. 3 suggests that the virus load along an airway increases with higher exposure levels.
Nonetheless, the chance of initiating an infection with a small dose of virus will likely be small as
the immune system can effectively fight against the virus based on Eqns. 14-16. However, in the
event of high exposure to the virus, the immune system may not be strong enough to fight against
the virus replication, and this increases the probability of the infection reaching the lungs.
Fig. 10(I − III) exhibit the variability in virus concentration over airway generations for three
different immune response d values while the exposure level C0 increases from 1 to 10000 Copies/ml
given that the respiratory rate is Q0 = 30 lmin−1 (d = 0.0 means d = 10−5 ). The virus load
propagates to the lower airway generations increases with higher exposure level, but it decreases
when the immune response gets stronger (i.e., d increases from 10−5 to 10). For instance, when the
exposure level is 1 Copies/ml, Fig. 10(I) shows that the virus load is > 1 Copies/ml above the 15th
generation, whereas that is around 0-5 Copies/ml when the exposure level in 104 in Fig. 10(III).
This situation may be in line with a healthy patient having mild symptoms only. Nonetheless,
when the exposure level is significantly higher than the strength of the immune response (e.g.,
C0 = 105 >> 101 = d) as depicted in Fig. 10(III), a larger quantity of viral particles propagate along
the respiratory tract regardless of the impact of the immune response. This in turn, will increase the
risk of lung infection and development of severe symptoms such as pneumonia. Therefore, when the
exposure level is approximately greater than 100 Copies/ml, there is a greater chance of developing
severe symptoms and that development may further accelerate with a weak immune system.

Discussion

The computational model presented in this study provides deep insights into the evolution of any
infectious respiratory virus along the respiratory tract given information such as respiratory rate,
airway structure and initial virus infection behavior. This model is, however, not limited to respiratory infections only but can also be used in several applications to understand the different issues
that may emerge. Therefore, we discuss the use of this model for understanding respiratory infection
SARS-CoV-2 as well as some other applications.
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, there has been considerable research undertaken
to understand the virus, screen current and novel compounds to identify drugs that might be effective
against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines (e.g., the study [18] identified multiple drugs that
were effective against SARS-CoV-2 and are now entering in vivo trials). This study reports the
development of a model that maps the evolution of virus concentration dynamics throughout the

respiratory tract with respect to a range of parameters that affect the propagation of the virus.

4.1

Tracking Temporal Propagation of Viral Particles

The virus load and the duration of virus replication are two important factors in terms of virus
transmission and infection,. The virus evolution with respect to time and generation levels within
the respiratory track depicted in Fig. 8, can be used to gather valuable insights to determine the
virus shedding time as well as the location for drug targets to minimize replication. A potential
application of this computer model, is drug targeting for diabetic patients who are known to have
abnormal immune response due to the damaged vascular endothelial cells that results in lower
immune response. The recent study [19], highlighted that there is a high risk of aggravation from
the viral infection in the lower respiratory tract for diabetic patients. In determining treatments for
such cases, knowledge about the virus propagation along the tract is the most critical information
that is required in understanding the evolution of the viral infection. Deriving such insights through
clinical studies is not always possible. For instance, the natural kinetics of SARS-Cov-2 in the human
lungs is not fully understood [20]. Generating such valuable insights to decide effective treatments
by using the computational model presented in this study can provide advantages that are difficult
to be acquired through clinical practices. For instance, given certain data on the virus load in the
nasal passage for a certain period of time, the model is capable of generating a complete image of the
predicted virus load along the respiratory and even along each airway generation at any stage of the
infection. The information about the virus evolution may, therefore, be incorporated to effectively
decide the optimal drug potency required to suppress viral replication along specific branches on the
airway.

4.2

Virus replication and propagation

Based on the mathematical models of airflow dynamics using the Navier Stokes equations, the
probability of the viral particle propagation and deposition deep into the lungs is high due to their
micrometer scale diameter. However, our study has found a number of factors that affects the
propagation dynamics, which fluctuates as it flows through the branch generations of the airways. It
is well known that the initial viral infection occurs in the upper respiratory system and then spreads
further down into the lung [18]. The main reason behind this is because the virus binds to cells
expressing ACE2. Fig. 4b shows the deposition rate is much higher in the upper airways under
the impaction and sedimentation process. This is due mainly to the propagation of virus under the
advection mechanism, which encounters turbulence in the airflow leading to increased collision of
viral particles on the airways walls. Fig. 6(I) also shows that the majority of viral particles deposit
over the upper respiratory tract, and this leads to a faster replication process before traveling down
deep into the lungs as shown in Fig. 8 (this also shows that the majority of the viral transmission
due to exhaling occurs due to the high replication rate that can occur in the upper respiratory tract
close to the nasal passage). There is also resistance against the flow of the viral particles due to the
cilia, hair and mucus lining along the upper respiratory tract; in our analytical model, the resistance
due to the cilia, hair and mucus lining was accounted as the drag coefficient and slip correction factor
in the computation of settling velocity ug under Eqn. 34 in SI 4.4. Fig. 4a shows the decrease in the
viral particle velocity due to these obstructions and this also results in faster deposition rate that is
dominated by the diffusion process deep down the lungs. As with most viral proliferation process,
Fig. 6(III) shows that the replication process can lead to 100-1000 fold increase in virus particle
number during the initial 24 hours of an infection. This replication rate is compromised as the
immune system starts to attack the virus based on the innate immune response first line of defence
[21]. In our study, the virus replication was derived by numerically solving the Eqn. 14 with clinical
viral infection data of the inlet virus concentration, immune response rate, concentration of ACE2expressed cells as well as the viral dying rate in [2, 18]. Due to the minimal amount of information
available on the replication rate of ACE2 expressed cells, our analytical model assumes that the
replication rate occurs at the same rate though, certain studies have shown that the replication rate
varies between different cells [22, 23]. As more data becomes available the model can be rapidly

adapted to account for this.
It is clear from this model that ACE2 expression is a key factor that determines virus infection,
replication and distribution in the respiratory system. ACE2 expression distribution dominates the
viral infection and replication, among all the other parameters. It is known that a number of factors
such as smoking [24], age, gender and race [25] can lead to varying densities of ACE2-expressing
cells, and these differences will have a key impact on clinical outcome as well as how easily a person
will transmit the virus to others. Our analytical model considers variability in the density of ACE2expressed cells along the branches of the airway tract, where there is greater ACE2-expressed cell
density in the nose and mouth (airway generation 1-2) as well as in the alveoli region (airway
generation 21-24). This complies with a recent study [9] that suggested the oral mucosa has good
expression of ACE2, while the study [26] highlighted that the ACE2-expression seems predominantly
greater in the AT2 (type II alveolar) cells that express high levels of ACE2 in the lung, while the
upper airways have a broad distribution of ACE2. This is why the virus load is considerably higher
in the top and lower sections of the respiratory track compared to branches in the middle airway
generations, and this is shown in in Fig. 7a for the lower immune response values. In addition, Fig.
7b also highlights the greater possibility of viral infection being distributed over the upper airways
and also alveoli region due to the higher density of ACE2 cells. Since our model is based on a spatial
branching structure of the airways, as more details of ACE2-expressed cells is available for each of
the branch links, this information can be inserted into our analytical model to gain more detailed
insights into the proliferation process along the airway network.

4.3

Immune Response to Viral Proliferation

It is already known that the most vulnerable groups to the SARS-CoV-2 are the elder people and
people with chronic diseases [27]. This is likely to be because because of their weakened immune
system that is not as effective at fighting against invasive pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 compared
to healthy individuals. This can be attributed to a general reduction in efficiency of the immune
system as well as a number of lifestyle habits such as smoking, imbalanced nutrient intake along with
environmental factors such as air pollution that can affect the immune system, making individuals
more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides insights into the impact of immune response
and its role in the viral proliferation down the branches of the respiratory tracts. Fig. 9a(I − III)
and Fig. 9c(I − III) shows that stronger immune response can effectively control the spread of the
virus down the respiratory tract even when a patient is exposed to a large quantity of viral particles.
Therefore, the computational model can provide a prediction tool for people who are at high risk
based on the effectiveness of their immune system. This model is of course focusing on the initial
infection and does not take into account secondary cytokine storm type responses that follow an
extended SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it does suggest that a stronger initial immune response
is particularly effective at limiting advancement of virus to the lower parts of lung where serious
damage can occur.

4.4

Exposure Level and Effective Dose

It is believed that a healthy person can take in the virus through either direct or indirect exposure.
The direct exposure occurs by being in close vicinity to the expulsion of the droplets from an infected
person (i.e., coughing, sneezing, singing, talking and heavy breathing), while the indirect exposure
is when the hands touch contaminated surface of droplets and this comes in contact with either the
mouth or nose. Therefore, theoretically, the direct exposure has a higher risk of receiving a large
dose of virus. However, it is still unclear what impact the concentration of the initial exposure dose
has on clinical outcome. It is important to also note that symptoms do not necessarily correlate with
virus load by nasal swab. In fact asymptomatic people have similar RT-PCR values to symptomatic
people, indicating that asymptomatics can probably transmit virus as efficiently as symptomatics.
The difference however, may the localization of the virus during the initial days of infection. If the
initial dose is high, this may overwhelm the front line defence and move rapidly to the lung where
serious disease is caused.

Hence, this study aims to also understand the effect of the exposure level on the virus load
and distribution, and how this is impacted by other parameters such as the immune response and
breathing rate. Fig. 9 shows that the virus load over the respiratory tract does not only depend
on the initial exposure level, but also the counter effect from the immune response. However, the
respiratory rate does not have a considerable influence on the spread of the virus load. For instance,
Fig. 9a(I − III) shows that greater immune response can control the virus load. Moreover, Fig.
10(I − III) also depicts that the weak immune response and high virus exposure level can make a
significant influence on the severity of infection. When the exposure level is significantly higher (at
least greater than 100 Copies/ml) compared to the strength of the immune response, the chance of
reaching a considerable quantity of virus in the lungs is very high, regardless of the respiratory rate.
In terms of real-world applications of this model, there are many possibilities. For example,
the computational model could, therefore, serve as a tool to understand how nanoparticles that are
proposed for binding on the virus, can propagate down the respiratory track and at the same time
determine the optimal quantity of the nano particles to be inhaled into the patient. In particular,
the computational model can be used to predict the required treatment for patients who are in
the high risk category (e.g., smokers). Moreover, the model also helps us to predict the infective
capabilities of future viruses that jump the species barrier, thus improving out ability to be ready
for another potential pandemic.

Virus Concentration Model Derivation (CGi (x, t))
To derive a model for characterizing the virus propagation along a respiratory airway generation
(Gi ), consider a control volume V of depth δx with a cross sectional area A as illustrated in Fig.
11 (i.e., V = Aδx). As Fig. 11 illustrates, when virus particles enter to an airway (shown as gray
circles), they deposit on the airways walls and subsequently the virus infection takes place. As a
consequence of the virus infection, more virus particles are reproduced (blue circles). The number
of virus particles in the control volume (i.e., virus concentration, CGi (x, t)) can be expressed as
dC i (x,t)
. Then, the accumulation of the virus in the control volume V can be formulated by
V Gdt
considering the mass balance, i.e., virus particle in-flux (fin ) and interior flux-loss to the airway
surface (floss ) and out-flux (fout ) of virus particles as follows:

where k(s−1 ) and p(s−1 ) are respectively the virus deposition rate on the airway surface and virus
reproduction rate and Q is the airflow rate through the control volume Qin = Q(x, t) and Qout =
Q(x + δt). Since the virus particles flow under the advection and diffusion mechanisms, the airflow
rate Q can be formulated as the total airflow due to advection and diffusion, and hence,
Q(x, t) = uCGi (x, t) − D∇CGi (x, t),

(18)

where u is the air flow velocity and D is the diffusion coefficient. Hence, the rate of change of air
flow rate along the x-axis (in practice, x−axis implies the direction to which air flows), dQ(x,t)

When the airflow achieves its settling velocity (i.e., when the airflow flow reaches its steady state),

By plugging Eqns. 20 and 21 in Eqn. 17), the change in virus concentration along an airway

CGi (x, t) = g(x, t)e(αx−βt)

with α = u/2D

Impedance (Z) airflow rate (Q) and airflow velocity (u)
Based on the conservation of fluid flow, the following conditions hold at a bifurcation junction as
represented in Fig. 12.
Q(L0 ,out) = Q(L11 ,in) + Q(Lr1 ,in)

and P(L0 ,out) = P(L11 ,in) = P(Lr1 ,in) ,

(39)

where Q- flow rate, P - pressure, Ll1 and Lr1 are respectively the length of the left (l) and right
(r) branches of the parent airway of length L0 (or in generation 1, G1 ). The subscript in and out
stands for the inlet and outlet of the airway, respectively.
Based on the circuit theory (i.e., Ohm’s law; V = IR, where V -voltage, R-resistance and Icurrent), the impedance (Z), resistance against the airflow, is then computed as Z = P/Q [5]. Thus,
the following relationship can be derived to compute the impedance at the junction (i.e., outlet of
the pipe) as

where ZL0 is the impedance of the parent airway (i.e., G0 ) and computed based on the following

As Fig. 12 represents the bifurcation (branching) of the respiratory tract as airway generations,
a backward process is followed to compute the airflow rates, and then the velocity profiles over the
respiratory tract.
Having computed the impedance of each airway generation, the airflow rate Q is then computed
by using Eqns. 44-47. Finally, the Q = uA relationship is used to compute the airflow velocity
profile of each airway generation.

Settling Velocity (ug )
The maximum velocity that a virus particle can achieve is known as its settling velocity; velocity of a
particle when the total external forces acting on it becomes zero. Fig. 3, for instance, depicts a virus
particle of mass m, diameter dp and density ρp that enters to an an airflow of density ρf at t = 0
with velocity u0 and then propagates along an airway with velocity uf under three external forces
given in Eqns. 48- 49. We assume the virus particle achieves its settling velocity ug at t = T after
traveling LT distance. When the virus particle moves through a projected area Ap at an arbitrary
time t, its relative velocity (velocity with respect to the airflow) can be expressed as up,t = uf − up ,
and it also gains an acceleration due to the imbalance of the external forces that act on it, and this
includes

Additional Results
Some additional results is presented here, aiming to give more in depth understanding about the
viral dynamics along the respiratory tract.

Impact of Breathing and Virus size on Virus Deposition
In addition to the impact of the airflow rate (or respiratory rate) Q0 on the flow velocity u and
deposition rate k presented in Fig. 5a(I − III) and 5b(I − III) in the main document, particle size
(this study considers the diameter dp ) can also impact on the particle deposition as larger particles
are mostly trapped in the upper airways, while smaller (e.g., micrometer scale) particles propagate
deep down the lungs. When the airflow rate Q0 is fixed to 30lmin−1 , while the impact of changes
in the particle diameter on the airflow velocity is presented in Fig. 14a(I − IV ), Fig. 14b(I − IV )
shows the influence of the particle size on the virus deposition along the respiratory tract. The
virus deposition rate increases with increasing particle size and a higher deposition can be observed
over the upper airway generations (∼ G0 − G15 ). However, the increase in virus deposition rate is
significantly less in the lower airways compared to the upper airway generations.

breathing rate Q0 with virus particle diameter 70µm) and (b) virus diameter dp when the breathing

Variability in Virus Load Over Airway Generations
Insights about the variability in the virus load over the respiratory tract is important particularly
in early diagnosis and making timely treatments to control the virus spread and development into
severe illness. This is critically important in treating patients with chronic diseases like diabetes. In
this regard, Fig.15 depicts the variability in the virus load over the respiratory tract after 35 days
given that a person exposed to the virus with an initial dose 105 Copies/ml and breathing rate is
30lmin. Since the ACE2 expressed cell density is high around the mouth as well as the alveolar
region, the variability in the virus load is high.

concentration vary over the the upper (∼ 1 − 3 generations ) and lower (∼ G21 − G23 generations)
regions as N (5 − 7, .71) and it is N (5.83, 0.71) over the remaining airway generations, and air flow
rate Q0 is 30lmin−1 and virus diameter dp is 70nm.

Impact of Respiratory Rate, Exposure Level and Immune Response on the
Change in Virus Load
In addition to the graphs given in Fig. 9 in the main document, to understand further the temporal
viral dynamics along the respiratory tract in response to the change in three selected parameters,
respiratory rate (Q0 ), immune response (d) and exposure level (C0 ), Fig. 16 shows the temporal
virus dynamics for different values of C0 , Q0 and d. The impact of the third parameter is averaged
when representing the impact of the remaining parameters on the changes in the virus load down
the respiratory tract. That is, for instance, the variability in the virus load with respect to Q0 and
C0 depicted in Fig. 16a(I − IX) is computed by averaging the virus load derived for the three d
values for each C0 and Q0 combination. All in all, Fig. 16 highlights that the exposure to a higher
virus load increase the chance of viral infection, although the strong immune response can suppress
the spread of the virus along the respiratory tract. Similarly, Fig. 16b(I − IX) shows the impact of
the exposure level C0 and the immune response d on changing the temporal virus dynamics along
the respiratory tract and it can be observed that the virus load is considerably higher for small
immune response values and higher exposure levels. Meanwhile, the impact of the respiratory rate
and immune response on the variability in the virus load along the respiratory tract depicted in Fig.
16c(I − IX) highlights that when the immune response is weak, the possibility of the virus spreading
