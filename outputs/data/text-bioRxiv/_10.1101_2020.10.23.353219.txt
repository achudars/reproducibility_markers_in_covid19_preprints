ABSTRACT

24

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 alongside the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS in

25

2012 underscore the significance to understand betacoronaviruses as a global health challenge.

26

SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19, has infected more than 29 million individuals

27

worldwide with nearly ~1 million fatalities. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 initiates viral

28

pathogenesis is of the utmost importance for development of antiviral drugs. Autophagy

29

modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent

30

clinical setbacks underline the urgent need for better understanding the mechanism of viral

31

subversion of autophagy. Using murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model

32

betacoronavirus, time-course infections revealed a significant loss in the protein level of ULK1,

33

a canonical autophagy regulating serine-threonine kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a

34

possible cleavage fragment. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target this protein,

35

we conducted in vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide

36

substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Mutagenesis studies discovered that

37

ULK1 is cleaved at a conserved PLpro recognition sequence (LGGG) after G499, separating its

38

N-terminal kinase domain from the C-terminal substrate recognition region. Consistent with this,

39

over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced canonical

40

autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex. Finally, we demonstrated a dual

41

role for ULK1 in MHV-A59 replication, serving a pro-viral functions during early replication

42

that is inactivated at late stages of infection. In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism

43

by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagic

44

pathway (Word count=250)

IMPORTANCE

47

The recent COVID-19 global pandemic alongside the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS outbreaks

48

underscore an urgent need to better understand betacoronaviruses as pathogens that pose global

49

challenge to human health. Studying the underlying biology of how betacoronaviruses subvert

50

innate cellular defense pathways such as autophagy will help to guide future efforts to develop

51

anti-viral therapy. (Word count= 55)

INTRODUCTION

53

The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) highlights the health crisis

54

worldwide. Although global efforts to restrict travelling and implement social distancing

55

practices have mitigated the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2

56

(SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, the virus remains a significant health threat

57

with over 29 million confirmed cases and nearly 1 million fatalities.

58

Autophagy-modulating drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychlorine have emerged as

59

potential anti-viral agents against SARS-CoV-2; however, recent placebo-controlled trials

60

showing no clinical benefits and possible safety concerns are spearheading global research

61

efforts for better understanding (1). Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that acts to

62

recycle cellular waste while also responding to invading pathogens. Cellular membranes termed

63

phagophores first enwrap cargo inside double-membraned chambers, so called autophagosomes,

64

after which cargo is degraded upon fusion of autophagosomes with digestive lysosomes. The

65

process is tightly regulated and responsive to various cellular stressors including nutrient-stress,

66

oxidative stress, as well as viral infection (2).

67

The serine/threonine unc-51-like kinase (ULK1) is a critical upstream regulator of

68

autophagy. The role of ULK1 as a nutrient-responsive orchestrator of autophagy has been well

69

characterized (3). ULK1 is recruited to sites of autophagosome biogenesis where it

70

phosphorylates key autophagy regulatory proteins. Its central role in autophagy has implicated

71

ULK1 in diverse human diseases from cancer and neurodegeneration to inflammatory disorders

72

(4-6). Structurally, ULK1 possesses an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal early

73

autophagy targeting (EAT) domain. The latter facilitates interaction of ULK1 with its various

74

substrates. Autophagy-independent functions of ULK1 have also emerged including the

75

regulation of ER-Golgi trafficking as well as innate immune signaling (7-10). For example,

76

stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a critical adaptor of the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP

77

synthase (cGAS), was previously identified as a substrate of ULK1 (11). Furthermore, the master

78

innate immune kinase TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was reported to be phosphorylated by

79

ULK1 and participate in metabolic signaling (12).

80

Many positive-sense RNA viruses, including betacoronaviruses, have evolved strategies to

81

co-opt autophagy by initiating and utilizing cellular double membrane vesicles as topological

82

surfaces for viral RNA synthesis (13-16); however, the precise mechanisms of viral subversion

83

of autophagy components are poorly defined. The current study uncovers the betacoronavirus-

84

encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) as a pathogenic factor that disrupts the regulated process of

85

autophagy in part by targeting the autophagy regulatory kinase ULK1.

RESULTS

89

Protein expression of ULK1 is decreased while RNA level is upregulated following mouse

90

coronavirus (M-CoV) infection

91

To understand the molecular underpinnings of betacoronavirus subversion of cellular autophagy,

92

we utilized mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model and examined its effects on

93

critical components of the canonical autophagy pathway. The serine-threonine kinase ULK1 is

94

an important regulator of cellular autophagy and has recently emerged as an innate immune

95

signaling factor (3, 7-9). The significance of autophagy and innate immune signaling as critical

96

facets of host anti-viral defense, prompted us to investigate the regulation and function of ULK1

97

during betacoronavirus infection. A time-course infection was conducted with MHV-A59 at a

98

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 in the murine fibroblast cell line 17Cl1. Viral replication

99

was verified by immunoprobing for viral non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) precursor. Coincident

100

with active viral polyprotein processing of NSP9 precursor, we observed a significant loss of

101

ULK1 protein starting at 12h post-infection with both anti-ULK1 antibodies tested in this study

102

(Figure 1A & B). Interestingly, using the polyclonal anti-ULK1 antibody that recognizes the

103

region of amino acids 351-400, we observed an additional band at ~65 kDa (Figure 1A).

104

However, this potential cleavage fragment was undetected with the monoclonal anti-ULK1

105

antibody that was raised against amino acids 511-750 (Figure 1B), indicating a cleavage event

106

may occur within this region. To investigate whether virus-mediated loss of ULK1 is through

107

transcriptional regulation, we performed RT-qPCR. Figure 1C showed that mRNA levels of

108

Ulk1 were elevated following 12h and 24h infection, suggesting that reduced protein expression

109

of ULK1 is not a result of decreased mRNA level. In contrast, elevated gene expression may

110

indicate a compensatory upregulatory mechanism following reduced protein expression.

112

PLpro cleaves ULK1

The discovery of a potential ULK1 cleavage product in MHV-infected lysates prompted us to

114

investigate

115

Betacoronaviruses encode two proteases, a papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) and a 3-

116

chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro, also known as the Main protease, Mpro) that process

117

viral polyproteins into individual functional proteins (17). We generated a construct expressing

118

PLpro of SARS-CoV-2, which has 63% similarity with PLpro domain 2 of MHV-A59 (Figure

119

2A). To determine whether PLpro targets ULK1, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with

120

either a control vector or a plasmid expressing PLpro for 24h. Expression of PLpro alone was

121

sufficient to recapitulate the reduction in full-length ULK1 observed following MHV-A59

122

infection using the monoclonal anti-ULK1 antibody (Figure 2B). PLpro-mediated cleavage of

123

endogenous ULK1 was then confirmed using N-terminal 3×Flag-ULK1 construct (Figure 2C).

124

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with PLpro together with 3×Flag-ULK1. Lysates probed with

125

an anti-Flag antibody revealed a significant reduction of ULK1 with the concomitant detection of

126

a lower-molecular-weight fragment of ~70kDa in size. To exclude the potential involvement of

127

3CLpro, we performed in vitro cleavage assay. Time course treatment revealed that ULK1 was

128

not targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, whereas coxsackievirus 3Cpro, the positive control,

129

demonstrated an efficient cleavage of ULK1 (Figure 2C). Together, our data suggest that PLpro,

130

but not 3CLpro, targets ULK1 for cleavage.

132

PLpro cleaves ULK1 after G499

133

To identify the precise location within ULK1 that is targeted by PLpro, we closely investigated

134

the protein sequence of ULK1 and identified two potential cleavage sites in the central region of

135

ULK1 with a previously reported consensus cleavage motif (Figure 3A) (18). Using the Flag-

136

tagged ULK1 construct, we mutated the potential cleavage sites and co-transfected wild-type

137

(WT) or mutant ULK1 with either control or PLpro construct into HEK293T cells. Expression of

138

PLpro resulted in the loss of the 3×Flag-ULK1 and the appearance of a faster migrating band at

139

~70 kDa in cells expressing WT-ULK1 and G531 mutant ULK1, but not in cells expressing

140

G499 mutant ULK1(Figure 3B), indicating that PLpro cleaves ULK1 after G499. The observed

141

N-terminal fragment matches the molecular weight of the predicted cleavage fragment. The

142

resulting cleavage of ULK1 by PLpro separates its N-terminal kinase domain from a C-terminal

143

substrate binding domain (Figure 3C).

145

PLpro-mediated cleavage of ULK1 disrupts autophagy

146

To understand the functional consequence of PLpro-mediated cleavage of ULK1, we first

147

examined whether the ability of ULK1 to interact with its binding partners is disrupted. ATG13

148

is a bridging molecule that directly interacts with both ULK1 and the scaffold protein FIP200 in

149

the autophagy-initiating ULK1 complex (3). Expression of PLpro resulted in reduced co-

150

immunoprecipitation of ULK1 with its binding partner ATG13 (Figure 4A). Given that the

151

ULK1 complex is required for starvation-induced canonical autophagy, we inquired the

152

functional significance of its disruption. The rate of autophagic degradation, designated as

153

‘autophagy flux’, can be measured by comparing levels of LC3-II, a substrate of autophagy, in

154

the presence or absence of a lysosomal fusion inhibitor (19). 17Cl1 cells were sham- or MHV-

155

A59-infected for 6h, 12h, and 24h either in the presence of DMSO or a lysosomal fusion

156

inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (BAF). Consistent with impaired autophagy, MHV-infected cells had a

157

reduced accumulation of LC3-II in the presence of BAF (Figure 4B). We next tested whether

158

PLpro expression can recapitulate the impaired autophagy observed following MHV-A59

159

infection. HEK293T cells were transfected with either a control vector or a plasmid expressing

160

PLpro for 24h and then subjected to starvation in HBSS medium for 2h in the presence or absence

161

of BAF. Control cells responded efficiently to starvation by increasing autophagy flux; however,

162

cells expressing PLpro did not initiate autophagy (Figure 4C), suggesting that PLpro expression

163

disrupts cellular autophagy.

164
165

ULK1 plays a dual role in MCoV replication

166

The role of ULK1 in betacoronavirus replication is currently unclear. To clarify this, we utilized

167

chemical and genetic approaches to target ULK1 prior to infection with MHV-A59. The

168

chemical inhibitor, MRT68921, potently targets ULK1/2 kinase activity (20). Functional

169

validation of the inhibitor showed the complete blockage of starvation-induced autophagy (ie.

170

reduced LC3-II accumulation in starvation-induced, BAF-treated cells (Figure 5A). To

171

investigate the consequence of ULK1 inhibition, 17Cl1 cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 for

172

1h, followed by replenishment with medium containing either DMSO or MRT68921 (5 M).

173

After 12 or 24h, the N-gene levels of MHV-A59 were measured by RT-qPCR. Compared to

174

control treatment, MRT68921 significantly attenuated viral RNA replication at 24h post

175

infection (Figure 5B). Consistent with a potential pro-viral role for ULK1, RNA levels and viral

176

titers of MHV-A59 were significantly reduced following gene-silencing of Ulk1 (Figure 5C).

177

We also assessed the effects of expression of WT- or non-cleavable mutant-ULK1 on viral

178

replication. We showed that cells expressing WT-ULK1 displayed significantly enhanced viral

179

titers (Figure 5D), supporting a pro-viral function for ULK1. However, a non-cleavable ULK1

180

mutant demonstrated diminished viral titers (Figure 5D). Collectively, these data support a

181

requirement of ULK1 for replication prior to its cleavage.

184

DISCUSSIONS

185

Diverse viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent the inherently anti-viral defense capacity

186

of autophagy (21). In particular, RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm can utilize

187

autophagic membranes as topological surfaces for viral replication (15, 22, 23). However,

188

viruses must evade selective targeting and degradation via autophagy, termed virophagy, a

189

process mediated by autophagy receptors that recognize and sequester viral components inside

190

autophagosomes (24). The autophagy receptor SQSMT1 was previously shown to mediate

191

virophagy of the positive-strand RNA virus Sindbus (25). To counteract this, enterovirus such as

192

coxsackievirus B3 and enterovirus-D68 have evolved strategies to subvert the host virophagy

193

efforts by engaging virus-encoded proteases to cleave SQSTM1 (26, 27). Similarly, enteroviral

194

proteases impede the degradation capacity of autophagy by disrupting autophagosome-lysosome

195

fusion through the selective cleavage of autophagic fusion SNARES (19, 28). Recent studies are

196

beginning to unravel the subversion strategies utilized by other RNA viruses. Global outbreaks

197

of betacoronaviruses in 2003 (SARS-CoV-1), 2012 (MERS), and 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) have

198

spearheaded efforts to better understand their relationship with autophagy. Despite great efforts,

199

there is a limited understanding of whether betacoronavirus-encoded proteases target host

200

substrates.

201

The murine betacoronavirus MHV-A59 was reported to induce double membrane vesicles

202

reminiscent of autophagosomes in the absence of intact autophagy (29), while infection of

203

porcine betacoronavirus, PHEV, demonstrated significant reduction of ULK1 (30). Findings

204

from the current study suggest that betacoronaviruses may actively target canonical autophagy

205

factors. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2-endoced PLpro can cleave ULK1 to disrupt

206

formation of the autophagy-initiating ULK1-complex and functionally impair starvation-induced

207

cellular autophagy/degradative capacity. SARS-CoV-1 PLpro was previously reported to have de-

208

ubiquitinase activity by recognizing the consensus LXGG motif similar to other host

209

deubiquitinating enzymes (31). Of note, we identified the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro cleavage site of

210

ULK1 after glycine (G) 499, follows precisely the consensus sequence recognized by the de-

211

ubiquitinase. The interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was also recently reported as a substrate

212

of PLpro following an LGGG consensus motif similar to ULK1 (32). The targeting of ULK1 and

213

possibly other host proteins harboring an LXGG motif therefore underscores potentially a novel

214

mechanism through which betacoronaviruses subvert cellular autophagy. In addition to

215

disrupting ULK1-mediated autophagy, the deubiquitinase activity of PLpro may favor viral

216

pathogenesis by disrupting selective autophagy, a process that relies on autophagy receptors

217

recognizing ubiquitin-modified pathogens or cellular cargo (33).

218

The role of ULK1 in betacoronaviral replication is poorly defined. We found ULK1

219

protein levels are relatively intact during the initial 6h of MHV infection. Furthermore, loss-of-

220

function studies prior to infection either through chemical inhibition of ULK1/2 kinase activity

221

or genetic silencing of ULK1 revealed a significant reduction in MHV viral replication. In

222

contrast, ULK1 protein levels are significantly decreased during late infection, coinciding with

223

the emergence of lower-molecular-weight cleavage fragment. Additionally, the expression of

224

WT-ULK1 that can undergo proteolytic processing by PLpro enhances viral titers unlike the

225

expression of a non-cleavable ULK1. Collectively, these data suggest that ULK1 may serve a

226

hitherto uncharacterized pro-viral role during early replication. The cleavage of ULK1 during

227

late infection likely suggests that (1) ULK1 function may be dispensable at late stages; (2) ULK1

228

may serve late-stage anti-viral function that needs to be inactivated; and/or (3) ULK1 cleavage

229

fragments may serve novel pro-viral function. The attenuation of viral titers in cells expressing

230

non-cleavable ULK1 suggests that persistent ULK1 activity throughout the course of infection

231

may be undesirable for virus. Indeed, ULK1 has previously been reported to regulate anti-viral

232

innate immune signaling (11, 12).

233

In summary, we uncover a novel function for the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 in cleaving the

MATERIALS AND METHODS

239

Cell culture, viral infection, and chemicals

240

Murine 17Cl1 fibroblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)

241

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a penicillin/streptomycin cocktail (100

242

µg/mL). MHV-A59 and 17Cl1 cells were provided by Dr. Nerea Irigonen (University of

243

Cambridge).

244

For MHV-A59 infection, cells were either sham-infected with DMEM or inoculated with

245

MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Cells were starved by culturing in Hank’s

246

Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) medium (Thermofisher Scientific, 14025076) for 2h. The V-

247

ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BAF, Sigma-Aldrich, B1793) was used at a concentration of

248

125 nM. The ULK1/2 kinase inhibitor MRT68921 HCl (Selleck, S7949) was used at a dose of 5

Plasmids

252

The 3×Flag-ULK1 plasmid was generated using a multiple cloning site modified CMV10 vector

253

backbone with the corresponding cut sites for ULK1 (EcorI/BamHI). Cleavage resistant mutants,

254

LGGG-499-QQQG and MRGG-531-MRDD, were generated using gBLOCKS DNA synthesis

255

(IDT) and fragments were cloned through restrict digestion of ULK1 with BstEII/FseI and

256

FseI/AflII, respectively. The cloning strategy for eGFP-PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 is outlined in

257

Figure 2A. Briefly, PLpro sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from NCBI [Wuhan Hu-1

258

Isolate reference sequence: NC_045512.2] and generated using gBLOCKS DNA synthesis (IDT)

259

with nucleotides corresponding to residues 713-1063 of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro sequence and cloned

260

into N1-pEGFP vector at Kpn2 and KpnI sites. The single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence

261

targeting murine Ulk1 is AATCTTGACTCGGATGTTGC. For transfection, cells were

Viral titer measurement

303

Samples were serially diluted and overlaid on 60-well Terasaki plates of HeLa cells. After 48h

304

incubation, 50% tissue culture infective dose titer (TCID50) was calculated by the statistical

305

method of Reed and Muench (34). Titers were expressed as plaque forming unit (PFU)/mL with

306

1 infectious unit equal to 0.7 TCID50 as described previously (35).
