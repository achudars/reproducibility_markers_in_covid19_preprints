Abstract
The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused global concerns about increased
transmissibility, increased pathogenicity, and decreased efficacy of medical countermeasures. Animal
models can be used to assess phenotypical changes in the absence of confounding factors that affect
observed pathogenicity and transmissibility data in the human population. Here, we studied the
pathogenicity of variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in rhesus macaques and compared it to a
recent clade B.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G substitution in the spike protein. The B.1.1.7
VOC behaved similarly to the D614G with respect to clinical disease, virus shedding and virus replication
in the respiratory tract. Inoculation with the B.1.351 isolate resulted in lower clinical scores in rhesus
macaques that correlated with lower virus titers in the lungs, less severe histologic lung lesions and less
viral antigen detected in the lungs. We observed differences in the local innate immune response to
infection. In bronchoalveolar lavages, cytokines and chemokines were upregulated on day 4 in animals
inoculated with D614G and B.1.1.7 but not in those inoculated with B.1.351. In nasal samples, we did
not detect upregulation of cytokines and chemokines in D614G or B.1.351-inoculated animals. However,
cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in the noses of B.1.1.7-inoculated animals. Taken together,
our comparative pathogenicity study suggests that ongoing circulation under diverse evolutionary
pressure favors transmissibility and immune evasion rather than an increase in intrinsic pathogenicity.

Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, so does the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the still relatively
susceptible global population. The detection of the B.1.1.7 variant in the UK prompted the World Health
Organization to institute a classification system for new variants, with Variants of Concern (VOC)
displaying increased transmissibility or detrimental changes in COVID-19 epidemiology; increased
virulence or a change in clinical disease presentation; or decreased effectiveness of public health and
social measures, or available diagnostics, vaccines, or therapeutics (1). B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 were the first
variants to be designated VOC. After initial detection, both variants spread to many other countries,
fueling concerns about their transmissibility and the efficacy of vaccines. As more epidemiological data
on human cases of B.1.1.7 infection become available, it appears that this variant transmits more
efficiently than the variants it displaced (2-6), possibly due to increased virus shedding (7). Whether
there is an increased disease severity associated with B.1.1.7 infection remains unclear (4, 8-11). Data
on infection in humans with B.1.351 are not yet widely available, and although its rapid spread suggests
increased transmissibility, there are no data to confirm this (12-14). Similar to B.1.1.7, it is not clear
whether B.1.351 infections are associated with a change in pathogenicity compared to the other
circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses (12-14).
Epidemiological data on increased transmissibility and disease severity can be confounded by changes in
human behavior and an increased number of cases affecting patient care. Although animal models do
not completely recapitulate human disease, they are useful tools to assess several phenotypical changes
such as virus transmission and pathogenesis in the absence of confounding factors. Several studies of
the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant in hamsters have been completed (15-17). However, since the changes in
the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) present in these variants could affect binding to the human
versus hamster ACE2 differently, replication kinetics of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 may differ between hamsters
and humans. The rhesus macaque is a widely used model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (18), and the amino

acids in ACE2 that are essential for binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike are identical between humans and
rhesus macaques (19). Therefore, we studied the pathogenesis of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in rhesus
macaques and compared it to a recent SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G substitution in spike
that rapidly became dominant globally in March 2020 (20) due to its’ increased transmissibility (21, 22).
We found that B.1.351 was slightly less pathogenic than the other two variants, but there were no
differences in virus shedding between the variants that could explain increased transmissibility.

Methods
Ethics and biosafety statement
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rocky
Mountain Laboratories, NIH and carried out in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International accredited facility, according to the institution’s
guidelines for animal use, following the guidelines and basic principles in the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, the Animal Welfare Act, United States Department of Agriculture and the
United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rhesus
macaques were housed in adjacent individual primate cages allowing social interactions, within a
climate-controlled room with a fixed light-dark cycle (12-hr light/12-hr dark). Animals were monitored at
least twice daily throughout the experiment. Commercial monkey chow was provided twice daily and
the diet supplemented with treats, vegetables and/or fruit at least once a day. Water was available ad
libitum. Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human interaction, manipulanda,
commercial toys, videos, and music. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with
infectious SARS-CoV-2 strains under BSL3 conditions. Sample inactivation was performed according to
IBC-approved standard operating procedures for removal of specimens from high containment.

To compare the pathogenicity and virus shedding of VOC B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, we inoculated three
groups of six rhesus macaques with three different SARS-CoV-2 isolates: SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/RML7/2020, a contemporary clade B.1 isolate containing the D614G substitution in spike,
hCOV_19/England/204820464/2020, a B.1.1.7 isolate, and hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP01542/2021, a B.1.351
isolate. Each group of six animals contained one older adult animal (age 15-16 years), one adult animal
(3-5 years) and four young rhesus macaques (age 2-3 years). All but one of the older animals were male.
Each group of animals was housed in a separate room. The animals were inoculated intranasally via a
MAD Nasal™ IN Mucosal Atomization Device (Teleflex, US; 0.5ml per nostril) and intratracheally (4 ml)
with an inoculum of 4x105 TCID50/ml virus dilution in sterile DMEM, resulting in a total dose of 2x106
TCID50. The inocula were titered on Vero E6 cells to confirm the correct dose was administered. The
animals were observed and scored daily according to a standardized scoring sheet (23); the same
person, blinded to the isolate the animals received, assessed the animals throughout the study. The
predetermined endpoint for this experiment was 6 days post inoculation (dpi). Clinical exams were
performed on 0, 2, 4, 6 dpi on anaesthetized animals. On exam days, clinical parameters such as
bodyweight, body temperature and respiratory rate were collected. Additionally, ventro-dorsal and
right/left lateral thoracic radiographs were taken prior to any other procedures (e.g. bronchoalveolar
lavage, nasal flush). Radiographs were evaluated and scored for the presence of pulmonary infiltrates
by two board-certified clinical veterinarians according to a standard scoring system. Briefly, each lung
lobe (upper left, middle left, lower left, upper right, middle right, lower right) was scored individually
based on the following criteria: 0 = normal examination; 1 = mild interstitial pulmonary infiltrates; 2 =
moderate interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, perhaps with partial cardiac border effacement and small
areas of pulmonary consolidation (alveolar patterns and air bronchograms); and 3 = pulmonary
consolidation as the primary lung pathology, seen as a progression from grade 2 lung pathology. At
study completion, thoracic radiograph findings are reported as a single radiograph score for each animal

on each exam day. To obtain this score, the scores assigned to each of the six lung lobes are added
together and recorded as the radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. Scores may range
from 0 to 18 for each animal on each exam day. Blood as well as nasal, throat, and rectal swabs were
collected during all clinical exams. Nasosorption swabs were collected from the nostril that was not used
for nasal swabbing; nasosorption swabs were inserted in the nostril and kept in place for 1 minute.
Nasosorption swabs were collected in 300µl PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.4% Tween-20 and vortexed
for 30 seconds. The swab and liquid were then placed on a spin filter (Agilent, 5185-5990) and
centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 20 minutes. Filtered liquid was aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
Additionally, on 2 and 4 dpi animals were intubated and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed
using 10ml sterile saline and a second sample was collected in the same location using a cytology brush
(bronchial cytology brush, BCB). The brush was then placed in 1ml DMEM containing 50 U/ml penicillin
and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. On 6 dpi, all animals were euthanized; after euthanasia, necropsies were
performed and tissue samples were collected. Histopathological analysis of tissue slides was performed
by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals.
Virus and cells
SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/RML-7/2020 (GenBank: MW127503.1; designated D614G throughout the
manuscript) was obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab obtained on July 19, 2020. Two passages of the
original swab were performed in VeroE6 cells. The virus stock used was 100% identical to the deposited
Genbank sequence. hCoV-19/England/204820464/2020 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_683466; designated B.1.1.7
throughout the manuscript) was obtained from Public Health Agency England via BEI Resources. The
obtained passage 2 material was propagated once in VeroE6 cells. Sequencing confirmed the presence
of three SNPs in this stock: nsp6 D156G (present in 14% of all reads), nsp6 L257F (18%) and nsp7 V11I
(13%). hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP01542/2021 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_890360; designated B.1.351 throughout the
manuscript) was obtained from Dr. Andrew Pekosz at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of

Public Health. The obtained passage 2 material was propagated once in Vero E6 cells. Sequencing
confirmed the presence of two SNPs in this stock: nsp5 P252L (17%) and nsp6 L257F (57%). The D614G,
B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 stocks contained similar ratios of SARS-CoV-2 E gene copies to infectious virus, i.e.
1.3x104, 1.6x104 and 1.5x104 RNA copies/TCID50, respectively.
VeroE6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine,
50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; SARS-CoV-2 stocks were grown in the same medium,
except with 2% fetal bovine serum.
Quantitative PCR
RNA was extracted from swabs and BAL using the QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues (30 mg) were homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was extracted
using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For detection of genomic
and subgenomic RNA, 5 µl RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay (24, 25) using the
QuantiFast probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer. In each run, standard
dilutions of counted RNA standards were run in parallel, to calculate copy numbers in the samples.
Virus titration
Virus titrations were performed by end-point titration in Vero E6 cells. Tissues were homogenized in 1ml
DMEM using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) and a 5 mm stainless steel bead. Cells were inoculated with 10fold serial dilutions of swab, BAL, BCB, or homogenized tissue samples in 96-well plates. Plates were
centrifuged for 30 minutes at 1000rpm and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO2. The inoculum
was then removed and replaced with 100 µl DMEM containing 2% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml
streptomycin. Six days after inoculation, CPE was scored and the TCID50 was calculated.
Next generation sequencing of viral RNA
Viral RNA was extracted as described above. Kapa’s RNA HyperPrep library preparation kit (Roche
Sequencing Solutions) was used to prepare sequencing libraries 10µl RNA. To facilitate multiplexing,

adapter ligation was performed with the KAPA Universal Adapter and Unique Dual-Indexed Primer
mixes. Samples were enriched for adapter-ligated product using KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready mix and 12
PCR amplification cycles, according to the manufacturer’s manual. Pools consisting of eight to ten
sample libraries were used for hybrid-capture virus enrichment using myBaits® Expert Virus SARS-CoV-2
panel and following the manufacturer’s manual, version 4.01, with eight - 13 cycles of post-capture PCR
amplification (Arbor Biosciences). Purified, enriched libraries were quantified using Kapa Library
Quantification kit (Roche Sequencing Solutions) and sequenced as 2 X 150 base pair reads on the
Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina).
Raw fastq reads were trimmed of Illumina adapter sequences using cutadapt version 1.12 (26) and then
trimmed and filtered for quality using the FASTX-Toolkit (Hannon Lab). Remaining reads were mapped
to the the respective hCOV_19/England/204820464/2020, hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP01542/2021, and SARSCoV-2/human/USA/RML-7/2020 genomes using Bowtie2 version 2.2.9 with parameters --local --nomixed -X 1500. PCR duplicates were removed using picard MarkDuplicates (Broad Institute) and variants
were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller version 4.1.2.0 (27) with parameter -ploidy 2. Variants were
filtered for QUAL > 500 and DP > 20 using bcftools.
Histopathology
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed on rhesus macaque tissues. After fixation
for a minimum of 7 days in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin and embedding in paraffin, tissue sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Immunohistochemistry was performed using a custommade rabbit antiserum against SARS-CoV-2 N at a 1:1000 dilution. Stained slides were analyzed by a
board-certified veterinary pathologist. Histologic lesion severity was scored per lung lobe according to a
standardized scoring system evaluating the presence of interstitial pneumonia, type II pneumocyte
hyperplasia, edema and fibrin, and perivascular lymphoid cuffing: 0, no lesions; 1, minimal (1-10% of
lobe affected); 2, mild (11-25%); 3, moderate (26-50%); 4, marked (51-75%); 5, severe (76-100%).

Presence of viral antigen was scored per lung lobe according to a standardized scoring system: 0, none;
1, rare/few; 2, scattered; 3, moderate; 4, numerous; 5, diffuse.
Cytokine and chemokine analysis
Serum, BAL fluid and nasosorption samples were analyzed for the presence of GM-CSF, MCP-1, TNF-α,
IFN-α2a, IFN-γ, IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-15 using the U-PLEX NHP Biomarker Group 1 kit (Meso
Scale Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read using a MESO
QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument (Meso Scale Diagnostics). Samples from animals inoculated with different
variants were randomized across plates to mitigate batch effects. Samples were inactivated via 2MRad
gamma-irradiation prior to analysis outside of containment (28). For BAL samples, 0.1% Triton X-100
(Sigma Aldrich) was added immediately before running the assay to prevent clumping. Analyte
concentrations and upper and lower detection limits were determined using the Discovery Workbench
software (Meso Scale Diagnostics) individually for each assay plate. Samples that fell below the lower
detection limit were replaced with the corresponding lower detection limit value. Data were analyzed
using Python (version 3.8.5) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.2.1). To correct for baseline differences in
cytokine concentrations between animals, the log2 fold change of analytes was calculated on a peranimal basis, using the 0 dpi sample as a baseline. Log2 fold changes were not calculated for BAL
samples, as a 0 dpi sample was not available. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Ward’s) was
performed on Euclidean pairwise distance matrices calculated from the mean of the log2 fold change or
concentration of analytes from animals in each group at each available timepoint using SciPy (version
1.6.0) and Seaborn (version 0.11.1) packages in Python.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 8.2.1. A p-value of 0.05 was
used as cut off for statistical significance.

Results
Reduced disease in B.1.351-inoculated rhesus macaques
The pathogenicity of two VOC isolates, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, was compared to the pathogenicity of a
recent clade B.1 isolate containing the D614G substitution in the spike protein. Three groups of six
rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with a total dose of 2x106 TCID50 of
one of the following SARS-CoV-2 isolates: SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/RML-7/2020, containing the D614G
substitution in spike, hCOV_19/England/204820464/2020, a B.1.1.7 isolate, and hCoV-19/USA/MDHP01542/2021, a B.1.351 isolate.
Clinical signs were mild in all three groups, with the main clinical signs observed being reduced appetite
and changes in respiratory pattern (Fig. S1). Additionally, a clear nasal discharge was observed on 6 dpi
in a single animal inoculated with D614G. Clinical scores were significantly lower in the animals
inoculated with B.1.351 than B.1.1.7 and D614G on several days after inoculation (Fig. 1A). Further
analysis of the clinical scores showed that this was due to a combination of differences in appetite as
well as respiratory signs. The B.1.351-inoculated animals had fewer days with a reduced appetite and
only 3 out of 6 animals inoculated with B.1.351 showed respiratory signs of disease at any time after
inoculation, compared to 5 out of 6 for D614G and 4 out of 6 for B.1.1.7 (Fig. S1). Radiographs collected
on 0, 2, 4, 6 dpi were analyzed for the presence of pulmonary infiltrates. Pulmonary infiltrates were
observed in the majority of inoculated animals; however, no differences were observed between the
three groups in the severity of infiltrates (Fig. 1B).

No difference in virus shedding between the three groups
Since increased virus shedding may lead to increased transmission efficiency, we studied virus shedding
after inoculation as a proxy for transmission potential. Nose, throat and rectal swabs were collected on
2, 4, and 6 dpi and analyzed for the presence of genomic RNA (gRNA), subgenomic RNA (sgRNA; an
indicator of recent virus replication (29)) and, in the case of nose and throat swab, infectious virus.
High amounts of gRNA, sgRNA and high virus titers were observed in nose swabs (Fig. 2A) on 2 dpi, and
these slowly declined over time. No differences in virus shedding from the nose were observed between
the three groups. A similar pattern of virus shedding was observed in the throat swabs (Fig. 2B), again
with no differences between the three groups. As previously observed (23, 30, 31), virus shedding was
less consistent in the rectal swabs than in nose or throat swabs, but again there were no differences
between the three groups (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the total amount of virus shedding was
different between the three groups, we also calculated the area under the curve for shedding of gRNA,
sgRNA and infectious virus in all swabs. No statistically significant differences in total amount of
shedding were detected (Fig. S2A).

Similar virus replication kinetics in the airways during infection
As an indicator of virus replication in the lower respiratory tract during infection, bronchoalveolar
lavages (BAL) and bronchial cytology brush (BCB) samples were collected on 2 and 4 dpi and analyzed for
the presence of gRNA, sgRNA and infectious virus. Viral loads and virus titer in BAL and BCB were highest
on 2 dpi and declined by 4 dpi (Fig. S2B, C). Although viral loads and virus titers were generally higher in
the BAL fluid than in the BCB sample, these two samples showed very similar kinetics overall, with
samples with low viral loads in BAL also having low viral loads in BCB. No statistically significant
differences were detected in viral RNA or virus titer in BAL or BCB between the three variants (Fig. S2B,
C).

To determine whether SNPs detected in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 virus stocks were stable in vivo, we
performed Next Generation Sequencing of BAL samples collected on 2dpi, close to the peak of virus
replication. No SNPs were detected in the D614G inoculum at an allelic fraction >0.1, and only one SNP
was detected in the BAL sample of one animal; this was a synonymous mutation in nsp6 (Table S1). The
B.1.1.7 inoculum contained 3 SNPs at >0.1 allelic fraction compared to the reference sequence; the
D156G in nsp6 was detected in all animals, but at an allelic fraction <0.1 in 5 out of 6 animals. The L257F
substitution in nsp6 was maintained in all animals, and the V11I substitution increased in frequency in 5
out of 6 animals (Table S1). The B.1.351 inoculum contained 2 amino acid substitutions compared to the
reference sequence; of these, the P252L substitution in nsp5 was maintained in 5 of 6 animals at slightly
higher percentages than in the inoculum, whereas the L257F substitution in nsp6 was maintained at
levels similar to the virus inoculum in all animals (Table S1). Overall, the vast majority of amino acid
substitutions present in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 inocula was maintained during replication in rhesus
macaques, indicating that the effect of these substitutions on virus replication was most likely neutral in
this host.

Lower virus titer in the lungs of B.1.351-inoculated animals
On 6 dpi, all animals were euthanized and necropsies were performed. To determine whether the
presumed increased transmission of B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 could be due to higher levels of virus replication
in the nasal turbinates, we collected nasal turbinate material from three sites in the nasal turbinates and
analyzed these for the presence of gRNA, sgRNA, and infectious virus (Fig. 3A). High viral loads of gRNA
and sgRNA were detected in the nasal turbinates of all animals; fewer tissue samples were positive for
sgRNA than gRNA, indicating virus replication had peaked before the time of sampling. There were no
statistically significant differences in viral loads between the variants (Fig. 3A). Fewer nasal turbinate
samples had detectable infectious virus in the group of B.1.351-inoculated animals than in those

inoculated with D614G or B.1.1.7, but this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 3A). Similar
analyses were performed on samples collected from all 6 lung lobes. Again, high viral loads of gRNA and
sgRNA were detected, with fewer tissue samples being positive for sgRNA than gRNA (Fig. 3B).
Significantly lower virus titers were detected in the lungs of B.1.351-inoculated animals than in those
inoculated with D614G (Fig. 3B), possibly explaining the lower clinical scores observed in the animals
inoculated with B.1.351 (Fig. 1A).
Additional tissue samples were analyzed for the presence of gRNA and sgRNA only. In the nasal mucosa,
gRNA levels were significantly higher in B.1.1.7-inoculated animals than in the other two groups (Fig.
S3); however, this difference was not observed in sgRNA levels in the same tissues and thus probably
does not represent increased virus replication in this tissue. Although B.1.1.7 appears to be detected in
the various tissue samples more frequently than D614G and B.1.351, these differences were not
statistically significant in individual tissues (Fig. S3).

Less severe histologic lesions and less viral antigen detected in the lower respiratory tract of B.1.351inoculated rhesus macaques
Lung tissues collected on 6 dpi were analyzed for the presence of histologic lesions. All inoculated
animals developed some degree of pulmonary pathology, resulting in lesions typical of SARS-CoV-2
infection in rhesus macaques. On observation, lung lesions in animals inoculated with D614G were
generally more severe than B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 while there were minimal differences between animals
inoculated with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 (Fig. 4A-F). Analysis of the histology scores assigned to each lung
lobe of all animals indicated that lesions in D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351-inoculated animals occurred on a
gradient from more to less severe, respectively; these differences were statistically significantly more
severe in D614G and B.1.1.7-inoculated animals than in B.1.351-inoculated animals (Fig. 4J).
Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in lung tissue. As shown

previously, viral antigen was present in type I and II pneumocytes, as well as alveolar macrophages. On
observation, the animals inoculated with D614G generally had more viral antigen than those inoculated
with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 (Fig. 4G-I). Analysis of the abundance of antigen presence in each lung lobe of all
animals again indicated a gradient of viral antigen abundance from D614G to B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. There
was statistically significantly more antigen present in the lungs of D614G-inoculated animals than in
those inoculated with B.1.351 (Fig. 4K), in line with the lower virus titers detected in the lungs of these
animals.

Subtle differences in local, but not systemic innate immune response
We analyzed serum, BAL and nasosorption samples for the presence of 10 cytokines and chemokines
and found different responses in the different sample types. In serum, the immune response peaked at
2 dpi, with animals demonstrating up-regulation of IL-6, IL-15, IL-1RA, MCP-1, IFN-α2a, and TNF-α, and
was largely resolved by 4 dpi (Fig. 5A). Subtle differences between variant groups were observed in the
levels of up-regulation of several cytokines, but the overall responses were largely similar (Fig. S4A).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering confirmed this observation, with samples clustering by timepoint
rather than variant group (Fig. 5A).
The cytokine and chemokine response in BAL was slightly delayed compared to that in serum, with the
peak response at 4 dpi. This was defined by up-regulation of GM-CSF, MCP-1, and IL-15, indicating a
concerted recruitment of leukocytes (Fig. 5B, S4B). Notably, this response was absent in B.1.351inoculated animals as indicated by these samples clustering separately from D614G- and B.1.1.7inoculated animals (Fig. 5B). The limited immune response in the BAL of B.1.351-inoculated animals is in
agreement with the reduced lung virus titers and histologic lesion severity observed in these animals
(Fig. 3B, 4I-J), suggesting reduced pathogenicity in the lower respiratory tract.

In nasal samples, we observed a striking difference in the immune response in B.1.1.7-inoculated
animals compared to those inoculated with D614G and B.1.351. Samples from B.1.1.7-inoculated
animals at all timepoints clustered separately, and showed a unique pro-inflammatory response
consisting of up-regulation of IL-6, MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-8, and GM-CSF that persisted up to 6 dpi (Fig. 5A,
S4C). Interestingly, B.1.1.7-inoculated animals were the only group that did not down-regulate IFN-γ
(Fig. S4C).

Discussion
Despite reports of a potential increase in disease severity in humans (10, 12-14), B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 did
not show increased pathogenicity in rhesus macaques. In fact, the B.1.351 isolate appears to be less
pathogenic in these animals. However, the absence of increased disease in individuals does not
necessarily mean an overall decrease in virulence, since increased transmission of these variants could
result in an increased disease burden of these variants on the population level (32).
The reduced replication of B.1.351 in the lower, but not upper respiratory tract, might imply that this
virus is evolving to become more like a virus of the upper respiratory tract. Likewise, the only difference
observed in our study between B.1.1.7 and D614G was in the innate immune response in the upper, but
not lower respiratory tract.
The virus shedding data in swabs collected from the upper respiratory tract did not directly explain the
increased transmission of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 observed in the population. However, the upregulation of
innate immune responses in the nasal samples collected from B.1.1.7-inoculated animals may
potentially play a role in the increased transmission of this variant. Nasal inflammatory responses such
as the increased cytokine and chemokine concentrations observed here have been linked to common
cold symptoms in humans (33, 34). Symptomatic 229E coronavirus infection in human volunteers was
linked to increased plasma exudation into the nasal cavity (35). One potential explanation for increased

transmission of B.1.1.7 could be that increased protein concentrations in nasal secretions caused by
plasma exudation could stabilize the virus in respiratory droplets (36). Alternatively, symptomatic 229E
infection leads to an increase in nasal mucosal temperature (35), which may affect the viscosity of nasal
secretions and thereby the production of respiratory droplets.
One limitation of our study is the lack of comorbidities and severe disease manifestations in the rhesus
macaque model. However, the age range of the animals used in this study (age range 2-16 years old) is
probably a fair reflection of the population currently exhibiting the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infections, which appears to be younger than early during the COVID-19 pandemic (37). Despite the
lower pathogenicity of B.1.351 overall, severe disease is still expected to occur in individuals with
comorbidities. More targeted epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the impact of variants of
concern on the disease burden in various subpopulations with and without comorbidities, while
excluding the effect of confounding factors such as the overall number of cases and changes in human
behavior.
The B.1.351 lineage has been associated with reduced neutralization by convalescent sera of humans
previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and in people vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (38). In addition,
reduced vaccine efficacy against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 was observed with the B.1.351 variant for
vaccines tested in multi-center clinical trials in South Africa and Qatar (39, 40). Rechallenge studies in
hamsters suggest that prior exposure with SARS-CoV-2 protects against disease but not re-infection of
the upper respiratory tract (41). These studies, together with our side-by-side comparison of three SARSCoV-2 variants in the most relevant animal model for preclinical development and comparative
pathogenicity, suggest that ongoing circulation under diverse evolutionary pressures favors
transmissibility and immune evasion rather than an increase in intrinsic pathogenicity.

Figure S1. Clinical disease observed in rhesus macaques inoculated with D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.
Three groups of six adult rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G, B.1.1.7 or
B.1.351. After inoculation, animals were observed for disease signs and scored according to a preestablished clinical scoring sheet. The number of days an animal showed reduced appetite (left panel) or
changes in respiration pattern (right panel) are indicated. Statistical analysis was performed using a
Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons; p-values <0.05 are indicated.

Figure S2. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and virus titers in swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages and bronchial
cytology brushes. Three groups of six adult rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 variants
D614G, B.1.1.7 or B.1.351. After inoculation, clinical exams were performed on 2, 4, and 6 dpi during
which nose, throat, and rectal swabs were collected. qRT-PCR was performed to detect genomic (left
column) and subgenomic RNA (middle column), and virus titration was performed to detect levels of
infectious virus (right column) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated as an indication of
the total amount of virus shed in these samples. Swabs (a), bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) (b) and
bronchial cytology brush (BCB) samples (c) were collected on 2 and 4 dpi and analyzed for the presence
of gRNA, sgRNA and infectious virus. Lines indicate the mean. Bars (a) and lines (b, c) indicate the mean.
Statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests (a)
or a 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (b, c); no p-values <0.05 were found.

Figure S3. Viral loads in tissues collected from D614G, B.1.1.7 or B.1.351-inoculated rhesus macaques
on 6 dpi. Three groups of six adult rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G,
B.1.1.7 or B.1.351. On 6 dpi, all animals were euthanized and necropsies were performed. Samples were
collected from many different organs and analyzed for the presence of gRNA (closed symbols) and
sgRNA (open symbols). Lines indicate the mean. Statistical analysis was performed using a 2-way ANOVA
with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; p-values <0.05 are indicated.

Figure S4. Cytokine and chemokine responses in rhesus macaques inoculated with a D614G, B.1.1.7 or
B.1.351 isolate of SARS-CoV-2. The concentration of 10 different cytokines and chemokines were
measured in serum (a), BAL (b), and nasal samples (c) at different timepoints before and after
inoculation. Fold 2 log changes were calculated for samples where baseline (0 dpi) values were available
(a, c); in the absence of a baseline sample concentrations are plotted in pg/mL (b). Blue circles: D614G;
pink squares: B.1.1.7; yellow triangles: B.1.351. Dotted lines indicate no change from baseline (a, c) or
the maximum lower limit of detection calculated across plates (b). Statistical analysis was performed
using a 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; p-values <0.05 are indicated.
