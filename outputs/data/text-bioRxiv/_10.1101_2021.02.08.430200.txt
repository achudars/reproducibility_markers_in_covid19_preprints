Germaphobia!

Abstract
Germaphobia –– a pathological aversion to microorganisms –– could be contributing
to an explosion in human immune-related disorders via mass sterilisation of surfaces
and reduced exposure to biodiversity. Loss of biodiversity and our connectedness to
nature, along with poor microbial literacy may be augmenting the negative
consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health. In this study, we created an
online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards, and knowledge of
microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature
and explored the relationships between these variables. We found a significant
association between attitudes towards microbes and both duration and frequency
of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week,
and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive
attitudes towards microbes. We found no association between nature
connectedness and attitudes towards microbes. We found a significant relationship
between knowledge of ‘lesser known’ microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi,
algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes towards
microbes. However, we also found that people who correctly identified viruses as
being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall –– this could
potentially be attributed to a ‘COVID-19 effect’. Our results suggest that basic
microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing
germaphobia. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g.,
COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related
disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced

biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a feasible strategy
to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. A greater emphasis on
microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could be useful in promoting
resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes towards the
foundations of our ecosystems – the microorganisms.

1. Introduction
Germaphobia – also known as ‘mysophobia’ – is the pathological fear of, and
aversion to dirt and microorganisms (henceforth referred to as ‘microbes’) (Zemke et
al. 2015). The rise of germaphobia has likely been influenced by decades of
advertising campaigns creating negative perceptions of microbes, and falsely
prompting mass (non-targeted) sterilisation of surfaces to achieve ‘safe’ human
environments (Timmis et al. 2019). Symptoms of germaphobia include excessively
washing hands, over-use of sanitisers and antibiotics and avoiding certain places
due to perceived to fear of microbial exposure (Qadir and Yameen, 2019). However,
far less than 1% of the microbes on the planet are human pathogens (Zobell and
Rittenberg, 2011; Balloux and van Dorp, 2017). Moreover, germaphobia may have
contributed to the current explosion in human immune-related disorders (such as
diabetes, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease) (Jun et al. 2018; Timmis et al.
2019). This is thought to be attributed to the notion that exposure to environmental
microbiomes – the diverse network of microbes in a given environment – plays an
important role in human health (Rook et al. 2003; Dannemiller et al. 2014; Stein et al.
2016; Arleevskaya et al. 2019; Liddicoat et al. 2019; Selway et al. 2020). Indeed,
from a young age, exposure to a diverse range of environmental microbes is

considered to be essential for the training and regulation of our immune systems
(Flies et al. 2020; Renz and Skevaki, 2020; Roslund et al. 2020). A stable and
functional human microbiome is colonised following birth. Firstly by the mother’s
skin and breast milk, and later supplemented from visitors, pets, biodiverse
environments, and a ‘normal dirty’ (not overly cleaned) home environment
(DeWeerdt, 2018). Germaphobia could conceivably inhibit all of these activities (e.g.,
avoiding playing in soil or staying away from animals), and if the microbiome
assembly process is derailed, the health consequences could be long-term.

Against the backdrop of COVID-19 –– a situation that could conceivably increase
germaphobia –– in addition to being hygienic, we need to promote the concept that
the majority of microbes are in fact innocuous and/or beneficial to human health.

Microbial communities and their interactions also play essential roles in carbon and
nutrient cycling, climate regulation, animal and plant health, and global food security
(Cavicchioli et al. 2019; Li et al. 2020; Trivedi et al. 2020). Therefore, microbial
biodiversity is of vital importance for the ability of ecosystems to simultaneously
provide multiple ecosystem services (Guerra et al. 2020). Consequently, ongoing
degradation of microbial communities poses an existential threat to global macrolevel biodiversity and to human societies across the planet. Loss of biodiversity and
our affective, cognitive and experiential connection with the natural world (also
known as ‘nature connectedness’), along with poor microbial literacy (such as
awareness of the different types of microbes and their importance) may be
augmenting the negative consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health

(Cavicchioli et al. 2019; Robinson and Breed, 2020). Is our diminishing connection
with (the rest of) the natural world helping to drive germaphobia itself? This could
have considerable implications for the health of humans and that of our diverse
ecosystems.

In this study, we used an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards
microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness using the Nature
Relatedness 6 Scale – a validated psychological instrument (Nisbet et al. 2013), and
data on respondents’ interactions with nature (including typical duration and
frequency of visits to nature). To gauge respondents’ basic knowledge of microbes,
we asked them to select all of the organisms (from a list) that they considered to be
microbes. The relationships between these variables were then assessed using a
range of statistical methods including logistic regression models, Mann Whitney U
tests, and 2-sample tests for equality of proportions with continuity correction in R.

The primary objectives of this study were to: (a) assess whether people’s patterns of
exposure to nature associated with their attitudes towards microbes (i.e., a positive
or negative view); (b) assess whether people’s level of subjective connectedness to
nature associated with their attitudes towards microbes; and, (c) investigate
whether basic knowledge of microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae,
protozoa, and archaea are also microbes) associated with attitudes towards
microbes.

Germaphobia!
Gaining a better understanding of the factors that may aid in reducing/preventing
germaphobia could help to inform environmental and public health policy. For
example, improving microbial literacy and promoting campaigns that seek to
reconnect humans with the wider biotic community could bring immense value to
both human and environmental health. Microbes are the foundations of our
ecosystems and are essential to the survival of all life on Earth (Cavicchioli et al.
2019). While targeted hygiene approaches and continued efforts to control
infectious diseases are undoubtedly vital, germaphobia only serves to inhibit a more
nuanced awareness of, and mutually-advantageous relationship with these diverse,
underappreciated, and indispensable lifeforms.

2. Materials and Methods
Online questionnaire
We produced a research questionnaire using the Smart Survey online software
(Smart Survey, 2020). The questionnaire included 21 multi-format questions
(Supplementary Materials, Appendix I). The questions were devised to gather data
on respondents’ attitudes towards microbes, their nature connectedness, and
interactions with nature. The online survey was active between April and July 2020.
We asked participants to answer questions regarding how emotionally and
cognitively connected they felt to nature using the Nature Relatedness Scale (NR-6)
(Nisbet et al. 2013; Kettner et al. 2019). The NR-6 comprises 6 questions, and
answers are recorded using a 1-5 Likert scale. Examples of questions include “My

relationship to nature is an important part of who I am”, “My ideal vacation spot
would be a remote, wilderness area”, and “I feel very connected to all living things
and the earth”. Items were averaged, and higher scores indicated stronger
subjective connectedness to nature. This validated instrument has been used in
several previous environmental psychology studies (Nisbet et al. 2013; Obery and
Bangert, 2017; Whitburn et al. 2020). We also asked several pilot-tested questions
regarding typical exposure to nature such as duration and frequency of visits to
natural environments. For this study ‘natural environments’ and/or ‘nature’ were
considered to be less anthropogenic/built-up environments, typically containing a
large proportion of vegetation and wildlife such as woodlands, parks, and meadows.
To acquire data on respondents’ attitudes towards microbes, we devised questions
such as “do you consider microbes to be good?; bad?; some are good, some are
bad?; or, neither are good or bad?”. We also devised a pilot-tested wordassociation measure using three categories: positive association, neutral
association, and negative association. To reduce potential bias, the categories were
not revealed to the respondents and each category contained five randomly-ordered
words, displayed as one amalgamated list. In the positive category, respondents
could choose from words such as ‘essential’ and/or ‘beneficial’. In the neutral
category respondents could choose from words such as ‘nature’ and/or ‘mobile’. In
the negative category respondents could choose from words such as ‘disease’
and/or ‘nuisance’. Respondents were asked to select a total of three words that
best reflected their view of microbes. To gauge respondents’ knowledge of

microbes, we asked them to select all of the organisms that they considered to be
microbes. The list included bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea.
We also acquired key demographic information including postal code, relative
deprivation, age, gender, highest level of education, and occupation. The
questionnaire, along with a detailed participant information sheet and consent form
was distributed across the world via a secure weblink. We used several non-random
sampling methods to reach respondents including: social media posting, emailing
volunteer groups, and carrying out an online search of publicly available community
group directories. The only exclusion criterion for the study was: people under 18
years of age. The questionnaire was ethically reviewed by the internal review
committee in the Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of
Sheffield (the authors’ academic institution).
Statistical analysis
To assess relationships between duration and frequency of visits to nature and
attitudes towards microbes, we acquired a score from the word-association output
by summing the positive, neutral and negative values given by each respondent. We
then assigned the positive and negative scores into two groups and compared the
mean duration and frequency of visits to nature of each group using the two-sample
Mann-Whitney U test with continuity correction in R. We assessed proportional
differences between groups, in which respondents either did or did not identify
different microbial groups (i.e., bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, protozoa, and
archaea) and their respective word-association scores using the 2-sample tests for
equality of proportions with continuity correction in R. We built logistic regression

models to assess the relationships between nature connectedness and attitudes
towards microbes. For these models, an odds ratio (OR) of 1 or above equated to
the predictor variable (nature connectedness score) increasing the odds of a
positive attitude towards microbes. An OR <1 equated to the predictor variable
decreasing the odds of a positive attitude towards microbes. We adjusted for
several covariates including age, gender, deprivation, and level of education.

3. Results
A total of n = 1184 respondents completed the questionnaire. A broad distribution of
responses from across the world was acquired (Fig. 1, A); however, the main cluster
(n = 993) was from England, UK (Fig. 1, B).
Respondents who identified as being female (n = 851 or 72%) outnumbered those
who identified as being male (n = 331 or 28%), trans woman (n = 1 or 0.1%), and
non-binary (n = 1 or 0.1%). There was also a skew towards respondents with a
higher level of education (n = 847 or 72% with ≥ undergraduate degree). In terms of
age, the distribution either side of the median was similar (n = 624 or 53% were ≥55
years old; and n = 560 or 47% were ≤54 years old).

Duration in and frequency of visits to natural environments, and attitudes
towards microbes
Our results show that respondents with a net positive word-association score for
microbes (i.e., those who viewed microbes more positively) spent significantly more
time per visit (x̄ = 87 mins) to natural environments such as woodlands, parks, and
meadows compared to respondents with a net negative word-association score for
microbes (x̄ = 70 mins) (W = 3995, p = <0.01) (Fig. 2).

Nature connectedness and attitudes towards microbes
We found no association between nature connectedness (measured using the NR-6
Scale) and attitudes towards viruses (OR: 0.99 (0.95, 1.02) p = 0.54) or all other
microbes (OR: 1.01 (0.89, 1.16) p = 0.86) (Table 1).

Microbial literacy and attitudes towards microbes
Mean positive scores (derived from word-association) towards all microbes were
significantly higher for those who correctly identified that fungi (X2 = 42.5, df = 1, p =
<0.01) archaea (X2 = 52, df = 1, p = <0.01) micro-algae (X2 = 30, df = 1, p = <0.01)
and protozoa (X2 = 51, df = 1, p = <0.01) were microbes compared to those who did
not identify these groups as being microbes. Mean positive scores towards all
microbes were significantly lower for those who correctly identified that viruses were
microbes compared to those who did not identify viruses as being microbes (X2 =
30.7, df = 1, p = <0.01). There were no significant differences in scores between
respondents who correctly identified bacteria as being microbes (n = 1124)
compared to those who did not (n = 60) (X2 = <0.01, df = 1, p = 1.0).

4. Discussion
This study shows a significant relationship between our attitudes towards microbes,
how long we spend in natural environments and how often we visit them. However,
we found no association between nature connectedness (one’s affective, cognitive
and experiential connection with the natural world) (Cheung et al. 2020; Choe et al.
2020) and attitudes towards microbes. Importantly, we found a significant
relationship between knowledge of ‘lesser known’ microbial groups (e.g., identifying

that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes
towards microbes. This study suggests that basic microbial literacy and nature
exposure may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia.
As mentioned, a higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration
spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive attitudes towards
microbes. It is important to note that the directionality of the relationship is unknown
(i.e., whether spending more time in nature helps to establish more positive attitudes
towards microbes, or whether other factors related to more positive attitudes
increase the likelihood of spending more time in nature). Conceivably, being less
averse to microbes could increase one’s desire to spend time in environments with
natural features such as plants and soil – key sources of dense microbial
communities (Liddicoat et al. 2019; Robinson et al. 2020). On the other hand, a
greater habituation to these kinds of environments and an affinity for diverse lifeforms could conceivably reduce one’s aversion to microbes in general. It is
important to acknowledge here that spending time in natural environments exposes
us to a diverse suite of microbial communities (Robinson et al. 2020; Selway et al.
2020) that are thought to have important beneficial effects on our health (Haahtela,
2019; Renz and Skevaki, 2020). Therefore, whatever the actual directionality

of

the proposed relationship is, it is likely to have an important impact on our health
and could help to ameliorate the negative consequences of germaphobia. In one
direction (i.e., contingent on factors related to more positive attitudes towards
microbes increasing the likelihood that we will spend more time in nature), we could
potentially gain the many benefits associated with nature engagement. These

include improvements in immune health (Li et al. 2010; Rook, 2013), mental health
(Birch et al. 2020; Callaghan et al. 2020), and cardiovascular health (Yao et al. 2020;
Yeager et al. 2020). In the alternative direction (i.e., spending more time in natural
environments which may help to establish more positive attitudes towards
microbes), our positive attitudes towards microbes could conceivably reduce the
likelihood that we carry out mass (non-targeted) sterilisation of our local
environments, which could also have important implications for our health (Jun et al.
2018; Parks et al. 2020; Prescott, 2020; Renz and Skevaki, 2020). This relationship
could also be non-dichotomous (or potentially even a virtuous loop) in the sense
that our positive attitudes towards microbes may predispose us to spend more time
in nature––an act that may enhance our positive attitudes towards microbes, and
the feedback continues. This theoretical relationship warrants further research.
There is potentially an important systematic error to also consider here––recently
termed the ‘Holobiont Blindspot’ (Robinson and Cameron, 2020). The microbes
within our bodies could influence our decisions to spend time in particular
environments and/or select conditions that favour particular taxa within the human
microbiome, which manifests as a cognitive bias if unrecognised. Could changes in
our microbiome influence our germaphobia? Further research is needed.
Given that nature engagement associates with positive attitudes towards microbes,
it would perhaps be expected that nature connectedness may also associate with
positive attitudes towards microbes. Studies have shown that people who exhibit
higher levels of nature connectedness are more likely to spend time in and engage
with natural environments (Capaldi et al. 2014; Capaldi et al. 2015), and reciprocally,

spending time in nature can enhance one’s nature connectedness (Nisbet et al.
2019; Chawla, 2020). However, the results of our study show that no significant
relationship existed between the nature connectedness of our respondents and their
attitudes towards microbes. This could be confounded by other factors, however,
age, gender, education and deprivation were controlled for with similar nonsignificant results. It may simply be that one’s affective, cognitive and experiential
connection with nature is not an important factor in predicting one’s attitude
towards microbes. We can only speculate and say that the invisibility of microbes to
the human eye could conceivably negate the affective, cognitive and experiential
connection that one may establish with, for example, charismatic fauna or
aesthetically-appealing flora. Alternatively, this result could be a facet of the nature
connectedness instrument used (the NR-6 Scale). Perhaps a more detailed version
of the instrument such as the 17-item Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) (Mayer
and Frantz, 2004) would reveal alternative findings. This warrants further research.
Finally, our study shows a significant relationship between basic level of microbial
literacy and attitudes towards microbes. Respondents who correctly identified that
lesser publicised (as microbes) organisms –– such as algae, fungi, archaea, and
protozoa –– were microbes, showed higher positivity scores towards microbes. This
implies that basic microbial literacy may be an important factor in the formation of
one’s attitudes towards microbes, and thus could influence the onset of
germaphobia. Interestingly, mean positive scores towards all microbes were
significantly lower for those who correctly identified that viruses were microbes
compared to those who did not identify viruses as being microbes. Although further

research is needed, one explanation could be that the COVID-19 (virus) pandemic
had an effect on people’s overall view of microbes. This is unsurprising given the
damage the pandemic has cause and the multi-pronged approach taken to try and
eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, it could conceivably have negative
cascading effects on our health by contributing to broader germaphobia.

Microbes are the foundations of our ecosystems and are essential to the survival of
all life on Earth (Cavicchioli et al. 2019). We now have the technology to easily
characterise and learn about these diverse invisible communities that continuously
surround us, providing essential ecosystem services. Perhaps in an educational
context, greater emphasis can be placed on microbial literacy moving into the
future. With a more nuanced awareness of, and mutually-advantageous relationship
with these diverse, underappreciated, and indispensable lifeforms, germaphobia can
potentially be reduced, while still maintaining the critically important targetedhygiene and efforts to control infectious diseases.
Limitations
Our study has some important limitations. Firstly, the results in the study are
correlational. Therefore, strict inferences of causation are not possible. Along similar
lines, inferences regarding the directionality of the relationships are also not
possible. Non-random sampling methods were used in this study. This means
accurate calculations of error and representativeness are not possible. Perhaps one
of the most important limitations is that self-reported data collection methods come
with inherent biases. For example, responder bias –– where participants (either

intentionally or by accident) choose an untruthful or inaccurate answer. Further
controlled research is required to fully unravel the complexities of the observed
relationships.

5. Conclusions
This study suggests that basic microbial literacy and nature exposure may be
important in reducing/preventing germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related
disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced
biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a simple strategy to
potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. Indeed, a greater
emphasis on microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could be useful in
promoting resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes
towards the foundations of our ecosystems – the microorganisms.
