Abstract:

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an acute worldwide demand for
sustained broadband pathogen suppression in households, hospitals, and public spaces. Infections
have surged past 160,000 daily new cases in the US, the highest rates yet seen during the
pandemic. In response, we have created a rapid-acting, self-sterilizing PPE configurations
capable of killing SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes in seconds. The highly active material
destroys pathogens faster than any conventional copper configuration. The material maintains its
antimicrobial efficacy over sustained use and is shelf stable. We have performed rigorous testing
in accordance with guidelines from U.S. governing authorities and believe that the material could
offer broad spectrum, non-selective defense against most microbes via integration into masks
and other protective equipment.
Summary:
A novel configuration of copper offers continued fast-acting protection against viruses and
bacteria, including SARS-CoV-2.

immediately upon contact. The sterility provided by widely used disinfectant options is all too
fleeting. Demands imposed by COVID-19 turned inefficiencies into breaking points; there is
simply not enough sterile equipment in the world to shield ourselves if materials do not offer
lasting protection. The masks we are using, while effective, accumulate bacteria over the course
of normal wear and are thus limited to a single use before they must be washed or discarded. 1
We need a material that keeps hands, surfaces, and tools free of pathogens over prolonged use.
Our copper configuration, termed ActiveCopper (aCu), was first produced as a novel all-copper
alternative to tin-based solder. Catalysis taught us that a material’s surface reactivity is
contingent on its surface area and energy; the larger the surface area, the more reactive it will
be.2, 3 aCu owes its activity to a large interconnected meso-structured metal network consisting of
polymeric gel-like copper material with meso-scale porosity and surface roughness. As COVID19 overwhelmed the world in early 2020, we hypothesized that this unique structure and its
surfactant shell should be highly antimicrobial. The literature is rife with examples of copper as
an antimicrobial and the EPA has approved hundreds of copper alloys for their disinfectant
properties.4–6 However, they are slow-acting and require up to 4 hours to fully deactivate
microbes. Because conventional copper surfaces disinfect more slowly, they still need to be
disinfected regularly. Given the structural differences between aCu and previous copper
iterations, it made sense to explore aCu’s anti-COVID activity.

Fig. 1 Synthesis of aCu via reduction of CuCl 2. Anhydrous copper(II) chloride is reduced with
sodium borohydride in the presence of amine surfactants to form the raw aCu material. The
reaction takes place near room temperature. The borane generated during the reduction forms
borane-amine complexes which are later hydrolyzed upon the addition of water to remove NaCl
byproducts. The amines assist in dissolving the copper(II) chloride and mediate resultant particle
sizes. This prevents the aCu particles from oxidizing and continuing to grow.
aCu is manufactured using a bottom-up synthesis approach via NaBH 4 reduction of CuCl2 in
solution (Fig. 1). The resultant copper material is rendered stable through the formation of a very
sticky paste-like metallic gel. It behaves like a typical non-Newtonian “liquid” with high
thixotropy (Fig. 5). The specially designed amine surfactant layer exerts strong cohesion via
hydrophobic interactions and organic end-chain entanglement, which holds the dense metallic
gel together with the aid of the high surface area and energy (Fig. 2) and does not dissolve in

water and most organic solvents. Its structure can be described as a dense but flowable metallic
gel-like paste with an interconnected meso-scale network, porosity and surface roughness that
enables safe handling and processing; it never turns into an airborne powder but rather hardens
into a solid copper mass similar to a xerogel, allowing the material to retain the high activity of
the unfused aCu.

We set out to quantify aCu’s activity against a host of viruses and bacteria with the eventual goal
of testing against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We formulated water-based paints to coat fabrics and
porous filter materials that could be used in face masks and air purification units such as HVAC
systems in airplanes, hospitals or public transportation.

As an initial rapid efficacy pre-screen, we tested Salmonella enterica-specific bacteriophage Ø32
against aCu. Two aCu formulations, A and E, were applied to sections of a cellulose/polyester
fabric blend (45/55% w/w) that is commonly used to make surgical masks. Both formulations
were applied at a concentration of 2·5 mg/in2; sample E included a small amount of CuCl2 as an
activator. The samples were inoculated with Salmonella bacteriophage and the resultant viral
plaques were counted at 5, 30, and 60 min post-challenge. All active samples showed 100% viral
kill rates after just 5 minutes; no plaques remained to be counted (Fig. 3A). To ensure that these
dramatic results were accurate, this test was duplicated on a different rayon/polyester (70/30%
w/w) fabric blend and yielded the same result (Fig. 3B).
To determine how quickly aCu acts against microbes, we opted to further decrease the testing
time increments to as short as 30 sec and test the kill rate upon initial contact.
Cellulose/polyester (45/55) samples were sprayed with two variations of aCu paint: C4 contained
paint alone, D4 included CuCl2 as an activator. Viral challenges of Salmonella bacteriophage
were administered to each of the samples. The remaining phages were measured at seven
intervals (T0, T30s, T1, T2, T2.5, T3, T5 min). At T0, reductions of 15,000 PFU/ml (C4) and

62,000 PFU/ml (D4), 6% and 23% respectively, had already taken place (Fig. 3Ca, b). By T2,
the D4 sample had achieved a 100% kill rate of both phage concentrations (Fig. 3Ca, b). Sample
C4 achieved 100% kill rates of the 2·7x104 PFU/ml concentration by T2 and the 2·7x105 PFU/ml
concentration by T3 (Fig. 3Ca, b). This compares very favorably to 70% ethanol, the disinfectant
regarded as the standard, which achieved a 3 log10 reduction of SARS-CoV-2 after 30 seconds,7
and a 2 log10 reduction of feline calicivirus after one minute.8

Next, we measured performance over an extended period of use to address the durability
requirements established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the registration of
copper alloys as antimicrobial agents. Regulations stipulate that compounds must be able to
continuously reduce a recurrent bacterial load,9 which would be expected in a hospital setting or
on surfaces in public transportation.
Over 14 days, aCu’s sustained antimicrobial efficacy was tested according to EPA protocol,
which calls for repeated inoculations over the course of 21 hours. 9 We lengthened the timeline to
better gauge the longevity we could expect from copper-coated fabrics (fig. S2) and applied a
very large viral load of 2·7x107 PFU/ml to simulate high touch-traffic scenarios. The first
extended exposure test was planned for 10 days anticipating some performance degradation.
aCu-coated cellulose/polyester (45/55) fabric was treated with a daily titer of Salmonella
bacteriophage Ø32 (2·7x107 PFU/ml). After 10 days, antimicrobial capacity showed no
degradation whatsoever. We opted to extend the test to 14 days. After 14 days the aCu-coated
sample had maintained its antiviral capacity (fig. S2). The material was as active against phages

subjected to the frequent and intense pathogen exposure that is a fixture of health care settings.

We wanted to understand what kind of durability and longevity we could expect from solid
surfaces coated with a layer of aCu paint. To test this, we used a piece of aluminum (2x2 cm, 3
mm thick) that had been fully coated with aCu paint in 2018 (batch #K0604-56ABP) and stored
indoors in ambient conditions with full exposure to seasonal temperature swings. It was
challenged with Salmonella bacteriophage Ø32 and the antimicrobial response was measured at
rapid intervals (T0, 15, 30, 60 seconds). By T15, 94% of the phages had been killed, by T30
97%, and by T60 fully 100% of the phages had been killed, leaving no viral plaques to count
(Fig. 3D). SEM analysis revealed that the copper material had not changed its morphology over
the two years, indicating excellent shelf-stability (fig. S4a). From these data we learned that aCu
maintains vigorous antimicrobial activity independent of its substrate; textiles and hard surfaces
are both viable mediums.

Fig. 4: SEM image of two-year-old copper coating layer on Al substrate. A after initial
coating in 2018; B 2 years later. Both show very similar agglomerated particle morphology,
shape and size (images have been sized to reflect identical scale).
Encouraged by aCu’s durability and fast action, we conducted efficacy testing based on ISO test
#18184:2019 – Determination of Antiviral Activity of Textile Products. aCu was applied to
cellulose/polyester fabric with additional CuCl2 as an activator. Samples were challenged with
human influenza A (H1N1 & H3N2) and feline calicivirus VR-782. Viral suspensions were
deposited onto the fabric samples and after two hours (shortest allowable with ISO) of incubation
the aCu textile had reduced the concentrations of all three viruses by more than 99% (Table
S6b). H1N1 was reduced by 99·93%, H3N2 by 99·77%, and feline calicivirus by 99·42%. It is
encouraging to yield favorable results against both enveloped (influenza) and non-enveloped
(calicivirus) viruses.
These preliminary investigations culminated in a test against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to
determine the suitability of aCu treated face masks to prevent virus transmission. The
cellulose/polyester (45/55) fabric was coated with aCu and adhesive. A viral load of

approximately 106 PFU/ml was applied to the fabric; after 30 seconds 99·9% of the virus had
been killed (Fig. 3F, Table S5). This dramatic efficacy makes aCu a very promising candidate for
the development of self-cleaning PPE.

To ensure that no harmful respiratory exposure occurs from using an aCu-coated insert in a face
mask, shedding tests were conducted under simulated breathing conditions. aCu-coated fabric
and blank controls were individually loaded into a sample holder and a flow of nitrogen was
administered at rates commensurate with breathing. Two different flow rates were tested, 4·1
slpm and 20 slpm, to simulate normal breathing and more intense breathing during physical
activity. Optical particle monitoring, condensation particle counting, filter trapping, and water
trapping were employed to assess the exhausted N 2 for shed particles (Fig. 3F, G). SEM/EDS
analysis of the filter traps did not detect any copper (fig. S4). Metal levels in the water trapped
from both treated and blank control materials were equivalent; no Cu was detected (Fig. 3F).
Optical particle counter tests found total particle counts to be <0·1 ng in each 15-minute test
window (fig. S3). These particles were organic in nature and looked like loose fabric material.
Hypothetically, if all of the identified particles were copper, it would equate to a maximum
shedding rate of 0·1 ng Cu per 15-minute period. This would translate to a maximal copper
“dose” of approximately 2 ng/hour for a wearer. This would be significantly below OSHA’s
maximum Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 1mg/m 3 for copper dust in the workplace.10 The
simulated breathing data offers reassurance that aCu-coated fabrics are safe for frequent human
use and proximity to the respiratory system.
Our results far exceed the benchmarks established by the EPA for speed of action as well as
material longevity and durability. The favorable results against multiple virus configurations
(enveloped and non-enveloped) suggest that aCu is broadly lethal against pathogens and is
therefore unaffected by the possibility of future mutations. Enveloped viruses, like coronaviruses
and influenzas, are generally regarded as less hardy than non-enveloped viruses. 11 aCu’s nonselectivity coupled with its rapid deactivation window suggests viability as an additive to
healthcare tools like privacy curtains, door handles and guard rails.
As with any material that contacts skin or the respiratory system, safety is of utmost concern. A
protective item must not introduce new health threats while protecting the user. To this end, it’s
pertinent to highlight copper’s long and safe history in medical and industrial materials. 12, 13
Ancient civilizations recorded medical copper use as early as 2200 B.C., and a more scientific
understanding was established when a doctor realized that copper miners and smelters enjoyed
distinct immunity from Paris’s 1832 cholera outbreak 4. Reliance on copper continued to grow
until it was displaced by penicillin in 1932. More recently, copper has been incorporated into
medical devices,14 dental cement,15,16 and dilute CuCl2 IV solutions to treat copper deficiencies
in patients.17 Copper’s bioactivity is relevant in both the synthesis and maintenance of skin
proteins; it is used in treating skin conditions.18 Extended dermal exposure to copper has been
shown to be well-tolerated.19

Copper plays an essential role in human health. It is involved in angiogenesis, 20 transcription
factor regulation, bone development, and various other physiological processes. 21 Deficiencies in
bodily copper can cause anemia, neutropenia, and neurological disorders. 21, 22 Because it is so
well integrated into human biology, robust mechanisms exist to regulate copper levels in the
body.23 Homeostatic maintenance of copper occurs via intestinal absorption and release is
mediated by the liver into bile.24 Small stores of copper are kept in the body, approximately 0·5
mg per pound of body weight in the average adult.25

When the EPA recognized the antimicrobial efficacy of copper alloys in February, 2008,
copper’s biocompatibility contributed to their determination that “these products pose no risks to
public health; copper products have been in use for centuries, and we know of no harm from
such use”.26 EPA recognition allows copper manufacturers to claim that approved copper
products “kill 99·9% of bacteria within two hours”.26 The two-hour guarantee of bacterial
deactivation is accompanied by an EPA mandate to maintain rigorous disinfecting regiments
because copper that works on this timescale could still transmit pathogens. Over 500 copper
alloys are registered with the EPA and deemed to have no “unreasonable adverse effects” under
the U.S. Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. 26
Because our testing indicated that aCu has the potential to function as personal protective
equipment in a medical setting, it is necessary to consider the precedent set by other medical
copper products prior to the development of aCu for safety and indicators of need within the
field. We considered the guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
listed fine copper powder (95% w/w Cu) as exempt from certification, deeming it safe for use as
a color additive in cosmetics. This qualification was extended to products intended for use
specifically in the eye area.27 The FDA’s relaxed position on copper provided further reassurance
that our material would create no health issues for the people using it. FDA approval has been
sought and granted for other medical copper products, establishing a precedent for copper’s
enduring modern utility. FDA approval was granted for a breathable face mask in 2016 28 that
protects against bacteria and influenza viruses. The mask material was proven to kill 99% of
tested bacteria after one hour of contact and inactivate 99·9% of test influenza viruses after five
minutes of contact.28
The antimicrobial technology at play applies fine zeolite infused with Ag + and Cu+ ions to the
non-woven polyester fibers of a mask. Their application method eliminated off-gassing or
leaching of the antimicrobial agent, which we have accomplished with aCu (fig. S3, S4). To
securely fix aCu paint to the intended material, we have adopted the practice of gluing (bonding)
aCu to the core of the fabrics. aCu’s protective lipid-type layer both protects and stabilizes the
high surface area of aCu, further enabling strong cohesion of the micron-size agglomerates (Fig.
1). Our highly active copper material is differentiated from related precursors by its ability to kill
viruses and bacteria in one minute or less.

Fig. 5 Image of aCu after being dispensed from a tube. The dense thixotropic copper gel is
paste-like and stable. It behaves like a typical non-Newtonian “liquid”. A layer of amine
surfactants exerts strong cohesion via hydrophobic interactions and organic end-chain
entanglement.
We have speculated on the mechanisms responsible for aCu’s non-specific eradication of
microbes and have been informed extensively by the work of other researchers. Research on
inorganic aerogels, xerogels and the like has shown that they exhibit high surface areas due to
their fine pore structure; they are strongly attracted to one another and other surfaces via
hydrophobic interactions or hydrophilic hydrogen bonding and chain entanglement. 29 This can be
enhanced by placing long-chain organic surfactants at their surfaces, forming a reverse micelletype structure. We did exactly that with our aCu and designed a surfactant monolayer that
maximizes attraction and mimics a lipid cell membrane. A virus’s small size (20-300 nm)
combined with its commensurate surface energy to aCu results in mutual attraction. When they
stick together, the protective lipid envelope and the protein capsid of the virus is readily attacked
by aCu. The copper oxidizes first to Cu+1 and then more rapidly to Cu+2 with the formation of
very aggressive OH* radicals in the presence of moisture and air as well as fatty acid radicals
from the oxidation of the protective lipid layer:
2 aCu0 + 2 H2O + O2  2 CuOH + 2 HO✹

20

2 aCu0 + 2 FA-COOH + O2  2 CuOH + 2 FA-COO✹

25

This process causes the lipid layer to disintegrate and the protein capsid to break open . 30, 31 The
destruction of the capsid was identified by Dr. Sarah Warnes, et al. in 2015 using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM).32 Viral replication is halted as Cu2+ ions, stabilized by their amine
surfactants, cleave and cross-link RNA/DNA through their affinity for nucleotides. 33 This
mechanism is analogous to the DNA binding exhibited by anti-tumor cis-platinum compounds.34

Both reactive oxygen species and ionic interactions have been shown to facilitate viral
deactivation. Due to the unprecedented speed and activity of aCu, more testing is necessary to
elucidate the exact order of operations.

Action against bacteria begins as their unique cell wall degrades. 35 Copper ions inhibit the
transpeptidases responsible for cross-linking the peptidoglycan wall, compromising its structural
integrity. Bacteriolysis is furthered by copper’s interruption of the necessary balance between
peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes and autolysin. 35 The destruction of such a fundamental
piece of the bacterial framework in both Gram negative and positive strains indicates that aCu’s
efficacy would not be hindered by bacterial mutation. Additionally, antimicrobial copper
experiments have been successfully conducted against a number of antibiotic-resistant strains.
Reactive oxygen species generated by Cu2+’s interactions with the cell wall and subsequent
permeation into the membrane may harm bacteria via cytoplasmic toxicity. 36 aCu does not act as
a mutagen, as antibiotics can,37 indicating that it is not liable to produce mutant bacterial strains
and contribute to antibiotic resistance.38
Around the world, people need to return to life, work, and family while protecting their health. A
growing number of people who experienced flu-like Covid-19 and were believed to have
recovered are reporting persistent fatigue, gastrointestinal, and cognitive issues that outlast their
original symptoms.39 In some cases, these long-term impacts manifest as cardiac dysfunction. 40
Trailing symptoms are not unprecedented with coronaviruses; a study conducted in 2009 on
survivors of SARS determined that 40% of respondents struggled with chronic fatigue. 41 In
addition to the detrimental follow-on effects of Covid-19, it is becoming apparent that reinfection
may be possible.42 The uncertainty that surrounds the long-term consequences of contracting
Covid-19 puts additional pressure on people to mitigate their risk, no matter their age.
Under the most optimistic outlooks, vaccine development will be completed in the first few
months of 2021.43 If trials and approvals are successful along this never-before-seen timeline,
major logistical hurdles will remain before a vaccine can be distributed to vast populations. At
this moment, public distrust in medicine and governing authorities translates to considerable
vaccine hesitancy in a multitude of countries.44–46 This apprehension will likely hinder the
compliance necessary to achieve broad inoculation and subsequent immunity. 47 A vaccine will
be a significant triumph. However, a long-lasting protective mask offers individuals an
immediate and reliable defense against COVID-19 while circumventing medical skepticism. It is
both reversible and individually administered; a vaccine is not.
Remedies targeted specifically at SARS-CoV-2 are in dire need, but in the long term we need
broad, non-selective protection against pathogens. In real time we have watched SARS-CoV-2
jump from humans to large populations of farmed mink in Denmark and now we are seeing a
second episode of zoonosis as farm workers become sick with the mink-mutated strain. 48
Genomic sequencing confirmed that this strain was transmitted from humans to animals and
back once more. When given the opportunity to move through a dense concentration of hosts,
such as a farm, viruses can mutate into more virulent forms much more quickly than they would

in the wild.49 A reassortant H1N1 influenza virus with pandemic potential has already been
identified in China,50 and we can continue to count on the appearance of seasonal illnesses. Due
to the lag time in developing vaccines, a situation is conceivable where the distributed vaccine
would miss the currently circulating coronavirus mutant. We posit that masks and other
protective pieces that self-sterilize to destroy 100% of pathogens could aid in an expedited return
to uninterrupted life.
