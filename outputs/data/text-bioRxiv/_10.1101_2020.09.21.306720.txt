Abstract:
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic initiated intense research into
the mechanisms of action for this virus. It was quickly noted that COVID-19 presents more seriously in
conjunction with other human disease conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and lung diseases. We
conducted a bioinformatics analysis of COVID-19 comorbidity-associated gene sets, identifying genes and
pathways shared among the comorbidities, and evaluated current knowledge about these genes and
pathways as related to current information about SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed our analysis using
GeneWeaver (GW), Reactome, and several biomedical ontologies to represent and compare common COVID19 comorbidities. Phenotypic analysis of shared genes revealed significant enrichment for immune system
phenotypes and for cardiovascular-related phenotypes, which might point to alleles and phenotypes in mouse
models that could be evaluated for clues to COVID-19 severity. Through pathway analysis, we identified
enriched pathways shared by comorbidity datasets and datasets associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic through the first half of 20201. The severity of the disease varies from
asymptomatic to lethal with a case mortality rate in the 20 most affected countries ranging between
1 and 15.3% (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality ; retrieved 24 July 2020). Severe disease shows
manifestations of both acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 2,3. In
pediatric patients, a blood vessel inflammatory pathology similar to Kawasaki disease is sometimes present 4.
All of these presentations have common elements of abnormality of inflammatory responses and
manifestations of vascular defects such as thrombosis, which may be causally related 5,6,7,8,9.

Since the emergence and global transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many studies have reported that
patients with certain underlying medical conditions have especially severe responses to the coronavirus
infection10. Some of the identified comorbidities that lead to severe disease are Cardiovascular Disease,
Diabetes, Hepatitis, Lung Disease, and Kidney Disease11,12,13,14,15,16,17.

Understanding what makes some patients suffer from severe COVID-19 is an ongoing puzzle that is being
investigated from both the virus and host perspectives18. We hypothesize that by exploring the underlying
genetic basis of comorbidities associated with severe disease, we can identify putative host genes and
pathways that are responsible for or contribute to the severity. Identification of these genes and pathways can
serve as a gateway for further investigation into understanding how the host responds to the virus and for
potential therapeutic strategies to interfere with a severe outcome.

We interrogated gene sets that are associated with the five previously mentioned underlying comorbidities to
determine gene products that are shared among them. We identified several pathways and phenotypes in
common, including those that are associated with severe COVID-19 pathology. All of the comorbid diseases
have been and continue to be actively studied, now in the additional context of response to SARS-CoV-2
infection19,20,21,22,23. In particular, the laboratory mouse has been extensively utilized as an animal model to
study these conditions24. As a result, mouse strains carrying mutations in shared genes or genes in shared
pathways, and engineered to be capable of being infected by the virus, can present useful starting points for
investigating the biological basis of disease severity25.

We report here on investigations of the host genetics and genomics of a set of comorbidity conditions. We
include data identifying the shared pathways and cellular mechanisms associated with these diseases and
correlate these data with recent studies of the genetic basis of the COVID-19 to identify elements that are

shared among comorbidities and the host response to the disease. Our results suggest specific directions of
future study to understand the genetic foundation of severe COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Gene Sets Used for Analysis
All gene sets used in our analysis are publicly available from the GeneWeaver resource
(www.geneweaver.org)26. Genes associated with Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Hepatitis, Lung Disease
were derived from gene sets associated with MeSH terms that relate to these comorbidities. The gene set for
Kidney Disease was derived from the union of genes associated with Proteinuria Hematuria, Elevated Serum
Creatinine, Increased Blood Urea Nitrogen and Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate in the Human Phenotype
Ontology (HPO)27. The genes in the MeSH and HPO gene sets and associated metadata (indicating their
association with COVID-19 and citations supporting the association) were incorporated into GW and used for
analysis. The comorbidity-related gene sets are shown in Table 1.

To create gene sets that are directly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), we identified several
relevant reports5,28,29 and captured gene sets available from these studies into the GeneWeaver environment.
Details are shown in Table 2.

Gene Set Comparison
To identify genes that were shared by all five comorbidities or four out of five comorbidities, we used the
GeneWeaver ‘Combine GeneSets’ tool. To visualize the intersection of comorbidity gene sets graphically, we
used the GeneWeaver ‘HiSim graph’ tool. To create a hierarchical view of interleukin pathways and the genes
that are shared among comorbidities we used the HiSim graph tool at the GeneWeaver resource with
homology excluded.

Functional Analysis of Gene Sets
To evaluate the shared biology of the common genes, we interrogated the genes that were shared among
comorbidities in two ways: 1) we conducted a phenotype enrichment analysis using the VLAD enrichment
tool30 and 2) we conducted a pathway enrichment analysis using the Reactome Knowledgebase resource31.

Mammalian Phenotype Enrichment Analysis
To investigate details of the phenotypes associated with the shared genes, we took advantage of the
mammalian phenotype data available from the Mouse Genome Informatics site (www.informatics.jax.org). The
Mouse Genome Database (MGD) group captures phenotypic data using the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
(MP), a computable ontological structure, that can be queried and used for phenotypic enrichment analysis32.
MGD also integrates these murine data into the context of human disease data based on orthology and gene
expression32,24. This integrated resource allowed us to exploit the associations of mouse genes and their
phenotypes for enrichment purposes using VLAD, and gives us an entry into identification of potential mouse
models for future study33.

Mouse orthologs for the shared human genes were identified using data available from the Alliance of Genome
Resources (Alliance) (www.alliancegenome.org/)34 using the Alliance release 3.1 stringent mouse-human
orthology set. If a human gene symbol matched more than one mouse marker, that gene was not included in
the analysis. This resulted in the following fourteen human genes being excluded from the analysis: AGTR1,
CCL2, CFH, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, GSTM1, GSTP1, HAMP, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, IFNA1, MMP1, SERPINA1, and
TIMP2. We did not identify mouse orthologs for two human genes (CXCL8, HLA-DQB1). Excluding these 16
from the initial 123 genes that were shared among four of five comorbidities, left us with 107 remaining mouse
orthologs which we used in the VLAD analysis. All but one of the 107 mouse genes (H2-Ea, a polymorphic
pseudogene; i.e. a coding gene in some strains and a pseudogene in others) had annotations to MP. The
VLAD phenotype analysis was run on 20 August 2020 using annotation data from 20 August 2020, ontology
data from 9 July 2020 and default parameters.

Reactome Pathway Enrichment Analysis
For pathway enrichment, we submitted the gene lists to the Reactome ‘Analyze Gene List’ enrichment tool
(https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#TOOL=AT) based on Reactome version 72. The analysis was
performed on 18 May 2020. Results were downloaded using the ‘Pathway Analysis Results’ and ‘Analysis
Report’ functionality at Reactome.

available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.

Pathway enrichment analysis was also performed for six COVID-19-related gene sets shown in Table 2. We
selected up-regulated (log2 fold change >=2) genes in host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 in three
cell cultures: human A549 lung alveolar cells (102 genes), Calu3 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells
(333 genes), normal human bronchial epithelium (NHBE) cells (14 genes); genes that are up-regulated in postmortem lung samples from COVID-19-positive patients relative to biopsied healthy lung tissue from uninfected
individuals (586 genes)28; immune-response and angiogenesis-related genes that are up-regulated in lungs
from patients who died from COVID-19 (114 genes)5; genes that are overexpressed in severe compared to
mild cases of COVID-19 (4 genes)29. We corrected for any symbols that were out of date and again used the
Reactome Pathway analysis tool. The analysis was performed on 10 August 2020.

Results
COVID-19 comorbidities share associated genes
To test our hypothesis that comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severity have common underlying
molecular bases, we chose five comorbidities that have been reported in the literature as closely associated
with poorer disease outcome: Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, Diabetes, Lung Disease and Cardiovascular
Disease. We searched the GeneWeaver Data repository for gene sets associated with these comorbidities and
identified gene sets from MeSH and HPO that we used in our analyses (Table 1).

To identify genes that were shared among the five comorbidity gene sets, we used the ‘Combine GeneSets’
tool to create a matrix of genes and sets in which they were contained. We tabulated the number of gene sets
that contained each gene and determined that eight genes were present in all five sets: APOA1, APOE, B2M,
CTLA4, F2, F5, HMOX1 and STAT3; 123 genes were common to at least four out of five comorbidity sets
(Table 3).

Genes shared among COVID-19 comorbidities are enriched for phenotypes
corresponding to immune system processes and circulatory system biology
We tested the functional significance of the genes shared among the five comorbidities by performing two
different kinds of enrichment analysis on our gene sets. First, we identified the mouse orthologs of the human

genes and performed a phenotype enrichment using the VisuaL Annotation Display tool (VLAD)
(http://proto.informatics.jax.org/prototypes/vlad/). For genes shared among all five comorbidities, VLAD
enrichment analysis identified 762 significantly enriched (p=<0.05) mammalian phenotypes (supplemental
table 1). The most significantly enriched terms fall into three general categories: T-cell related phenotypes,
inflammation or infection related phenotypes, and cardiovascular phenotypes including blood clotting. Table 4
shows that of the eight shared genes, several were annotated to each of the significantly enriched phenotypes.

We repeated our phenotype enrichment analysis using genes that are co-annotated to four of the five
comorbidities associated with COVID-19. When we examined the shared genes among comorbidity sets, we
found that 123 genes were shared among four out of five comorbidities. Phenotype enrichment analysis
performed with the 107 one-to-one mouse orthologs of these human genes was consistent with our analysis of
the eight genes that were conserved in all five comorbidities. The increase in gene number resulted in an
increase in the number of significantly enriched mammalian phenotype terms (p=<0.05) with 3232 terms
included in the enrichment analysis (supplemental table 2). VLAD analysis showed that the major areas of the
ontology with the most highly significant enrichment were, as in the analysis for the eight genes shared by all
the comorbidities, in inflammatory response and infection, leukocyte biology and blood vessel morphology.
Abnormal blood coagulation was no longer in the most highly significant group of phenotypes, but was
significantly enriched (p=1.52x10e-11).

Similar to our results for the eight genes shared among all five comorbidities, the mouse orthologs of the 123
genes shared in four out of five comorbidities showed many genes associated with each of the most significant
phenotypes (Table 5).

Pathway analysis enrichment includes cytokine signaling pathways, blood coagulation
and plasma lipoprotein metabolism
In addition to our phenotype analysis, we were also interested in investigating whether the genes shared
among comorbidities were enriched for specific biological pathways. To answer this question, we used our
human gene sets and the Reactome Knowledgebase in an enrichment analysis for biological pathways.

Reactome is a manually curated resource that captures information about reactions, their relationships and the
genes and chemicals that play a role in those reactions35.

We interrogated the Reactome Knowledgebase using the eight genes that were shared among all five
comorbidities and identified 103 pathways/subpathways that were significantly enriched (FDR=<0.05,
supplemental table 5). Reactome pathways are organized into a hierarchical format where grouping pathways
are subcategorized into more specific pathways which in turn are eventually represented by individual
reactions. Reactome captures information about not only the genes and molecules that act in a pathway but
also those that are acted upon, thus casting a wide net for genes that are included in an analysis. The 25 most
significantly enriched pathways grouped under several parent pathways are shown in Figure 1. Two genes,
APOA1 and APOE, are shared among several plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodeling and clearance
pathways. Three genes, APOA1, F2 and F5, are found in the hemostasis pathway, all are included in platelet
activation and the latter two in blood clotting. Five of the eight genes shared among the comorbidities were
involved in immune system pathways: B2M, HMOX1, CTLA4, STAT3 and F2. Of these five genes, three are
included in cytokine signaling: B2M, HMOX1 and STAT3. Other informative pathways showed that APOA1,
APOE, F2 are in GPCR downstream signaling, and F5, APOA1, APOE are in vesicle-mediated transport.

We repeated the pathway enrichment analysis with the 123 genes that were shared by four out of five
comorbidities. We identified 172 pathways that were significantly enriched (FDR=<0.05, supplemental table 6).
These results supported and confirmed the results we obtained with the eight genes that were shared among
all five comorbidities. Although with lower significance, enriched pathways include ‘common pathway of fibrin
clot formation’ (FDR=5.9x10e-3; four genes), ‘platelet degranulation’ (FDR=6.0x10e-6; thirteen genes) and
‘plasma lipoprotein assembly remodeling and clearance’ (FDR=0.034; five genes). Immune signaling pathways
and particularly interleukin signaling pathways were frequent in our enrichment results (Figure 2). The
downstream GPCR signaling pathway and the retinoid/vitamin pathways were no longer significantly enriched.

We compared our pathway enrichment results with our phenotype enrichment results for the eight genes
conserved among all five comorbidities to determine if there was consistency between the results obtained

from independently curated resources: MGI phenotype and Reactome. Like the pathway analysis, our
phenotype enrichment analysis also revealed lipoprotein phenotypes for significant enrichment, for example
‘abnormal circulating lipoprotein level’ (p=1.81x10e-2). Phenotype analysis also revealed ‘abnormal blood
coagulation’ and ‘decreased platelet aggregation’ (p=5.81x10e-8 and p=2.64x10e-2 respectively) in common
with the pathway analysis. Our results from the analyses of the 123 genes conserved in four out of five
comorbidities were also consistent. The pathway analysis revealed that the 25 most significant pathways were
pathways related to the immune system, in particular there was concordance with the results from the eight
genes, identifying pathways related to inflammatory responses, interferon and interleukin signaling. In total, the
results of all of our analyses show that five comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 share common
physiological aspects including cytokine signaling, blood clotting, and plasma lipoprotein biochemistry.

STAT3 is shared among interleukin signaling pathways that are enriched in COVID-19
comorbidities
To further investigate whether there is a common molecular basis for the interleukin signaling pathway
enrichment we examined the Reactome enrichment results using the 123 genes conserved in four out of five
comorbidities for interleukin signaling pathways (supplemental table 3). We created gene sets of the shared
genes that were in Reactome interleukin pathways that are significantly enriched (FDR<0.05). We used the
HiSim graph tool in the GeneWeaver resource to create a graphical view of the genes that are found in the
sets. The gene conserved among the largest number of sets is STAT3 which is found in nine of the eleven
significantly enriched interleukin signaling pathways. IL12B is shared among four signaling pathways (data not
shown).

Genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection response and genes shared among
COVID-19 comorbidities identify common cytokine signaling pathways and hemostasis
Since we had identified pathways that were common to COVID-19-associated comorbidities, we investigated
whether these pathways were also associated with the COVID-19 itself. To answer this question, we created
gene sets directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from published literature (Table 2). GeneWeaver

Gene Set GS398287, represents four plasma cytokines that are significantly elevated in patients with severe
disease versus patients with mild disease29. GS398329 represents 114 genes associated with angiogenesis or
inflammation that were upregulated in COVID-19 postmortem samples5. Two gene sets, GS398539 and
GS398534, of 119 and 333 genes respectively represent genes that are upregulated in two distinct lung
adenocarcinoma epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2; GS398533 with 14 genes represents genes that
are upregulated in normal human bronchial epithelium cells infected with SARS-CoV-2; GS398334 represents
587 genes upregulated in post-mortem COVID-19 samples28. We ran Reactome pathway enrichment analysis
on each of these sets and determined the enriched pathways that were shared with those identified in the
comorbidity analyses (supplemental tables 7-12). Unsurprisingly, GS398329 and GS398287, which were
preselected for genes involved in the immune response, were enriched for immune response pathways.
GS398329, preselected to be associated with angiogenesis, also showed significant enrichment for the
comorbidity pathways associated with platelet biology. All of the data sets showed significant enrichment for
signaling mediated by interleukin-4, -10 and -13 (Table 6).

Identification of potential mouse models to study comorbidities and COVID-19
severities
The results of our phenotype analysis using mouse orthologs of shared human genes shows that phenotypic
enrichment is consistent with the pathway enrichment using the human genes and is also consistent with
pathologies associated with severe COVID-19: blood coagulation, inflammation and cardiovascular
pathologies36,37,38,39,40,41. Since mice provide an attractive genetic system for disease modeling, we investigated
the phenotypes associated with each of these genes in further detail. Figure 3 shows each of the eight genes
shared by all five comorbidities and the phenotype categories that were enriched in this set. Yellow highlighting
indicates that mutations in the mouse gene have been annotated to a phenotype of a category that is enriched
in the eight shared genes. For example homozygous mice of the genotype Ctla4tm1Shr/Ctla4tm1Shr display
multiple phenotypes that are shared with severe COVID-19: abnormal lung inflammation, abnormal cytokine
secretion (interferon secretion) and autoimmune response42. Hmox1tm1Mlee/Hmox1tm1Mlee mice are another
example with cardiovascular, immune and liver system phenotypes
(http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:2429784).

Discussion and Summary
COVID-19 is a global health concern. The disease is complex and varies in severity from asymptomatic to
lethal43. As our understanding of the disease has progressed, a number of comorbidities associated with the
disease have been identified that lead to greater severity. The goal of our work is to identify underlying genetic
factors that might explain the mechanism of why certain comorbidities lead to more severe disease. To this
end, we studied genetic features of five comorbidities that are associated with severe COVID-19:
Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Hepatitis, Lung Disease, and Kidney Disease. We identified common genes
that were associated with each of the comorbidities and the pathways and phenotypes with which they are
associated. We compared the results of the comorbidity analysis with genes that were directly associated with
SARS-CoV-2 and showed that they shared common pathways involved in the immune response and platelet
biology. Our results are encouraging in that these areas of physiology have also been correlated with severe
disease. Here we discuss our results in the context of COVID-19 severity.

Our analysis of genes shared among both comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 infection identified several
interleukin signaling pathways that were enriched in both categories. Interleukin-4/-13 and interleukin-10
signaling shared enrichment among the largest number of gene sets we examined, and interleukin-6,
interleukin-12 and interleukin-2 shared enrichment between at least one comorbidity set and a set of genes
upregulated in patients who died from COVID-19. STAT3 positively regulates the transcription of IL-6, which
controls inflammation44 and is a downstream signaling player in the IL-6 pathway through the IL6ST
protein45,46. IL-12 is produced in response to infection and signals through the JAK-STAT pathway, including
STAT3, to induce the proliferation of NK cells and T cells. These cells in turn trigger cytokine signaling
including interferon gamma47.

One mechanism proposed for the severity of COVID-19 is the coincidence of severe acute respiratory distress
triggered by a cytokine related syndrome triggered by the angiotensin signaling pathway48. An interesting
aspect of this proposal is its action through STAT3, one of the genes that we also found conserved in the
comorbidities we studied. Targeting the JAK-STAT pathway has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.21.306720; this version posted September 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-192. Our results show that STAT3 is conserved in all five comorbidities we analyzed. This supports the
hypothesis that a promising therapeutic strategy to combat severe COVID-19 compounded by preexisting
comorbidities may be to target common JAK-STAT pathways.

In addition to immune signaling pathways, we also saw shared enrichment for pathways involved in platelet
biology. Platelets are the cells that are responsible for blood clotting49. Abnormal clotting has been observed in
severe COVID-19 patients and it has been suggested as a complication that leads to more severe disease50,51.
Magro et al. reported that the abnormal clotting observed in severe COVID-19 patients correlated with
activation of the complement pathway52. Our results show that HMOX1, APOA1, APOE and two members of
the coagulation cascade, F2 and F5, are shared among all five comorbidities we examined. In mice, Hmox1
deficiency leads to coagulation defects and results in arterial damage due to oxidative stress53. APOA1 is
released during platelet degranulation as part of the platelet secretory granule54 (Reactome:R-HSA-482770).
APOA1 levels have also been shown to be significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients55. APOE is a
gene that encodes a lipid binding protein involved in cholesterol metabolism56. Preliminary evidence suggests
that the e4 allele of APOE may lead to a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis and the same allele also predicts
severe COVID-1957,58. F2 and F4 are both involved in the formation of a fibrin clot (Reactome:R-HSA-140877).
The complement pathway and coagulation cascade have been shown to interact, tying together inflammation
and hemostasis59. Additionally in a proteomic study of proteins differentially expressed in the serum of 28
severe COVID-19 patients compared with non-severe COVID-19 patients, Shen et al. report that 50 of 93
differentially regulated proteins fall into three categories one of which is platelet degranulation55. These results
suggest that one of the factors contributing to severe disease in patients with any of the five comorbidities may
be due to an underlying genetic mechanism that acts through the hemostatic pathway.

Our results show that genes that are shared among five comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19
identify pathways that are consistent with the pathologies associated with the disease. In our analysis we
excluded mouse orthologs that did not correlate 1:1 with human genes to avoid potential skewing of the
enrichment analysis by having multiple paralogs over-represented. Despite this, and the exclusion of several
potentially important immune system genes such as some histocompatibility genes, our results show that

analysis using mouse orthologs of the shared genes also identifies phenotypes that are consistent with disease
pathology. The laboratory mouse provides a tractable system to study the effects of genetic foundations of the
comorbidities and severe disease. As mentioned above mice carrying Ctla4tm1Shr/Ctla4tm1Shr and
Hmox1tm1Mlee/Hmox1tm1Mlee homozygous mutations display multiple phenotypes consistent with severe COVID19 pathology. Mice engineered for mutations in these genes crossed with mice engineered to carry the human
ACE-2 SARS-CoV-2 viral receptor, ICR-Tg(Ace2-ACE2)1Cqin/J, would be a starting point to explore the
underlying genetic variants related to comorbidities interact with viral infection60. Humanized mice, like the
Apoetm3(APOE*4)Mae strain, which carries the human E3 variant mentioned above as being implicated in both
severe disease and an underlying thrombosis pathology, could be used in conjunction with ICR-Tg(Ace2ACE2)1Cqin/J to study the effects of the human variant on viral infection. A comprehensive resource for using
the mouse as a model system for COVID-19 research is maintained by the Mouse Genome Informatics Group
[http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/coronavirus.shtml].

In this study we have used a bioinformatics approach to interrogate genes associated with five COVID-19
comorbidities that correlate with severe disease. Using genes that have been annotated to these comorbidities
in the MeSH or HPO resource we have shown that genes are shared among the comorbidities and that shared
genes are enriched for pathways that could be the genetic basis for the pathologies observed with severe
COVID-19, specifically our results suggest that the interrelated pathways of hemostasis and inflammation may
be key players in understanding the severity of comorbidities with COVID-1961,62. Our studies provide a
gateway to understand how host genetics interacts with and influences the consequences of viral infection. Our
knowledge about COVID-19 continues to grow at a rapid rate and future work will entail the examination of
additional comorbidities, more specific comorbidities, a wider survey of genes beyond our initial seed set from
MeSH and HPO. As we learn more about correlations between individual comorbidities and disease
pathologies, we may be able to identify specific pathway/comorbidity combinations that can be used to inform
us about treatment decisions. Our work also provides an entry point into an experimental system using the
laboratory mouse to manipulate host genetics and to study its subsequent effect on the pathology of viral
infection.

Table 6. Comparison of pathway enrichment false discovery rates (FDR) for pathways with FDR <=0.05
(shown in light red) for at least one of the comorbidity sets and for at least one of the COVID-19 related
gene sets: comorbid8 column displays FDR for comorbidity set for all five comorbidities; comorbid123 for
comorbidity set for four of the five comorbidities; A549 for up regulated genes in host transcriptional response
to SARS-CoV-2 in human A549 lung alveolar cells; Calu3 for up regulated genes in Calu3 human lung
adenocarcinoma epithelial cells; NHBE for up regulated genes in normal human bronchial epithelium (NHBE)
cells; postmortem for up regulated genes in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19-positive patients;
PMID:32437596 for up regulated angiogenesis and inflammation genes in lungs from patients who died from
COVID-19; PMID:32217835 for genes that are overexpressed in severe compared to mild cases of Covid-19.
The score column gives the number of sets with FDR meeting our criteria. Shaded in yellow are the pathways
significantly enriched for both the comorbidity sets and several COVID-19 sets based on highest scores. The
full table displaying 28 pathways meeting our criteria is given in supplemental material. (Complete list of
enriched pathways available supplemental table 4; enriched pathway details for each gene set available
