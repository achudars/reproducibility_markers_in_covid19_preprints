Abstract:
The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by
SARS-COV-2 continues to ravage many countries in the world. Mpro is an
indispensable protein for viral translation in SARS-CoV-2 and a potential target in highspecificity anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug screening. In this study, to explore potential drugs
for treating COVID-19, we elucidated the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and explored
the interaction between Mpro and GC376, an antiviral drug used to treat a range of
coronaviruses in Feline via inhibiting Mpro. The availability and safety of GC376 were
proved by biochemical and cell experiments in vitro. We determined the structure of
an important protein, Mpro, in SARS-CoV-2, and revealed the interaction of GC376
with the viral substrate and inhibition of the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Results and Discussions:
The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by
SARS-COV-2 continues to rampage across the world. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2
requires the intact function of a 3C-like protease, also called the main protease (Mpro),
encoded by the gene of nonstructural protein (NSP) 5. The function of Mpro is
indispensable for viral replication and transcription and is therefore an attractive drug
target against SARS-CoV-2. After viral infection in host cells, two polyproteins, pp1a
(486kD) and pp1ab (790kD), are translated, and they are then cleaved by Mpro
together with papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro). After the cleavage at 11 sites by Mpro
and 3 sites by PL2pro, pp1a and pp1ab are processed to release a series of NSPs that
have diverse functions to mediate viral replication and transcription1. Mpro also
contains a distinct P2 Asn-specific substrate-binding pocket and has been reported to
inhibit cellular translation by cleavage of poly(A)-binding protein2, 3.

To explore potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we aimed to solve the SARS-CoV2 Mpro structure and study its interactions with potential drug molecules. Mpro was
expressed in Escherichia coli cells and then purified via affinity and size-exclusion

chromatography. The purified Mpro showed a monodispersed peak and a molecular
weight of approximately 33.8 kD (Supplementary information, Fig S1). Mpro was
crystallized and its structure was determined at 2.35 Å resolution. Like SARS-CoV, the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro forms a dimer with two protomers vertically packed with each other
(Fig. 1a; Supplementary information, Table S1). The Mpro monomer contains three
domains with domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184) forming a barrel
structure of six antiparallel β-strands (Fig. 1a, Supplementary information, Fig. S2a)4.
Between domain I and II is a cleft that forms the catalytic dyad cys145-his41 and
substrate binding site, which is comprised of the highly conserved substrate binding
pockets (Supplementary information, Fig. S2b)5, 6. Domain III (residues 201-303) is
comprised of a globular cluster of five antiparallel α-helices, which is involved in the
dimerization of Mpro. Domain II and III are connected through a loop (residues 185200) and domain I contains a stretch-out “N-finger” (NH2-terminal) that is inserted into
domain II of the other protomer via interaction with F140 and G166 (Fig 1a,
Supplementary information, Fig S2a)6. Meanwhile, the surface charge distribution in
the active site of Mpro displays bi-polar distribution that is fit for the binding of peptide
substrates (Fig. 1b).

Several small molecules have been reported to effectively inhibit coronavirus Mpro7,
and we performed thermal shift assay (TSA) to test the binding of each drug to SARSCoV-2 Mpro. Each drug (20 μM) was incubated with Mpro and the melting profile was
monitored based on the SYBRO orange reaction at 25-99℃. GC376 shifted the melting
curve of Mpro from 50.87℃ to 55.23℃ (+4.35℃), while other drugs show little effect
(Fig. 1c, Supplementary information, Table S2), indicating the direct binding of GC376
to Mpro. To test if the process is titratable, TSA was repeated with different
concentrations of GC376 (0-20 μM) and melting temperature of Mpro was increased
with the increased doses of GC376 (Fig. 1d).

GC376 is a bisulfite adduct of a peptidyl derivative, containing leucine and proline with

an additional phenylalanine ring (Fig. 1e). GC376 has been reported to be able to
inhibit 3CL protease8, which gives GC376 a broad anti-viral spectrum, including human
norovirus9. However, the drug now is currently used to treat animal coronavirus
diseases, such as feline infectious peritonitis10. Because of its high binding affinity to
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro verified by the TSA (+4.35℃), a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug
application) about the usage of GC376 on COVID-19 treatment has been submitted to
FDA11.

Structure of GC376-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex was solved through co-crystallization
and GC376 was found to occupy the Mpro substrate binding site (Fig. 1f). The binding
of GC376 to Mpro is stabilized by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions.
GC376 forms direct hydrogen bonds with G143, H163 and E166 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
The proline ring and leucine side chain of GC376 fit well into the Mpro S1 and S2
pockets, and form an extensive set of hydrophobic interactions with the conserved
residues from the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 1f). In addition, after removing bisulfite
group, GC376 can form covalent bond with Mpro Cys145, the catalytic residue,
revealing its ability to directly block the catalytic dyad and its protease activity. This
shows the potentiality of GC376 to act as a covalent inhibitor to prevent the binding
and cleavage of the substrate. The structure of our GC376-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
complex was compared to the COVID-19 Mpro structure solved by Rao, et al6 (Fig. 1g)
and MERS 3CLpro12 (Fig. 1h) respectively, and a good agreement can be observed.
Comparison with COVID-19 Mpro shows high conservation of domain I and II, with
small variable regions in domain III. Comparison with MERS Mpro shows the same
localization of GC376, indicating that the inhibition of these viruses by GC376 is
mediated through a similar mechanism.

To verify the effectiveness of GC376, we tested the ability of GC376 to inhibit SARSCoV-2 Mpro enzymatic activity, which revealed a 50% inhibition concentration (IC50)
of 1.5 μM (Fig. 1i). We also tested the ability of GC376 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection

in pre-seeded Vero E6 cells. GC376 showed a 50% maximal effect concentration
(EC50) of 0.18 μM (Fig. 1j). In contrast, GC375 has a 50% cytotoxic concentration
(CC50) of more than 200 μM, showing an excellent safety profile (Fig. 1k). Both
structure analysis and in vitro tests by our studies indicate that GC376 is a relatively
effective and safe drug candidate for SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting Mpro. Further animal
experiments and clinical trials are warranted for validating the potential use of GC376
for the treatment of COVID-19.

Materials and methods
Protein Expression and Purification.
The gene encoding SARS-CoV2 Mpro containing a histidine-tag followed by the TEV
protease cleavage site was cloned into pET28a plasmid vector. The construct was
transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and cultured in LB medium. 0.5
mM IPTG was added to induce expression at 15 °C for 16 hours. Then the cells were
broken up by High Pressure Homogenizer and centrifuged at 18000 rpm for 60 min.
The supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography (His FF) and the His tag of
Mpro was eluted by cleavage buffer (50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500mM NaCl, 5%
glycerol, 300mM imidazole). Then the protein underwant size-exclusion
chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL). TEV protease was added and
incubated over night at 4 °C. The Mpro was further purified by ion affinity
chromatography (His HP) and Size-exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/600
Superdex 200 pg). Finally, quality control of Mpro was conducted through SDSPAGE, analytical size-exclusion chromatograph (Superdex 200 Increase 5/150 GL)
and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
Crystallization of Mpro
SARS-CoV2 Mpro was incubated on ice for 2h after the 1mM GC376 Sodium added.
500 nL protein (10.81mg/ml) and 500 nL reservoir were added. The complex was
crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C. The best crystals
were grown with 0.2M Lithium chloride, 0.1M Hepes pH 7, 20% w/v PEG 6000 buffer,
with a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained after 3 days of
growth.
Data collection and structure determination
X-ray diffraction data were collected at (CLS in Canada) at beam line (CLSI BEAMLINE
08ID-1) using a wavelength of (0.97949) Å. The Mpro structure was determined by
molecular replacement (MR) with (phaser), using the X-Ray Crystal Structure of the
SARS Coronavirus Main Protease as a template (PDB code: 1q2w). The model was
then manually adjusted by COOT.
Thermal Shift Assay
Thermal shift assay was performed in Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real time system.
For each reaction, 5 µL of compound working solution was added to 96-well RT-PCR
plate (AXYGEN, USA). Then 10 µL Mpro purified protein (0.5 mg/ml) working solution
was added to each well. The different compounds were incubated with protein for 1
hour at 4°C. After incubation, 5 µL dye SYPRO Orange working solution was added to
each well. The reaction was run in an ABI 7500 fast real-time PCR system with a ramp
rate of 1°C per minute from 25°C and ending at 99°C.
Viral Infection Experiments
Vero E6 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium (MEM, Gibco Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco
Invitrogen), at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV8

2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) was propagated in Vero E6 cells1, and viral titer
was determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) as described in
previous study2. All the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-3
(BSL-3) laboratory.
The IC50 assay of GC376 sodium for 3CLpro
Three-fold serial dilute the GC376 sodium stock solution (10mM, DMSO) with DMSO
to get the 50x compound solution, whose concentrations range from 0.5-10000μM (10
doses). 8.3 fold dilute 50x compound solution with pure water to prepare 6x GC376
sodium solution containing 12% DMSO, whose concentrations range from 0.01-200μM.
Then use 1.2x reaction buffer (24mM HEPES pH7.0, 19.2mM NaCl, 2.4mM DTT, 0.012%
Triton-X100) to dilute 3CLpro to 375nM and peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKMEEdans (10mM, DMSO) to 36μM, to get 1.5x 3CLpro solution and 6x substrate solution
respectively. Add 10μL 6x substrate (36μM), 40μL 1.5x 3CLpro (375nM) and 10μL 6x
compound solution (different concentration) to each well in 384-well Micro plate
(Corning, #3575). Make sure final DMSO concentration is 2% in each well. After adding
reagents, centrifuge plate and vortex. Immediately after vortex, read the signal for
30min via TECAN M1000 plate reader through kinetic model. The instrument settings
are shown in table S3. Data was analyzed via GraphPad Prism 6.0.
Evaluation of antiviral activities of the test compounds
Vero E6 pre-seeded in 48-well dish (1 x 105 cells/well) were treated with the different
concentration of the indicated compounds for 1 hours and infected with SARS-CoV-2
at a MOI of 0.05. Two hours later, the virus-drug mixture was removed and cells were
cultured with drug containing medium. At 24 hours p.i, the cell supernatant was
collected and lysed. The viral RNA extraction and quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis was described in previous study2.
Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the test compounds
Vero E6 pre-seeded in 96-well dish (5 x 105 cells/well) were treated with different
concentration of the indicated compounds, and 24 hours later, the relative numbers of
surviving cells were measured with cell counting kit-8 (GK10001, GLPBIO) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Figure. S2 The conservatism of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
a, The amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, MHV and
HCoV-229E were compared and the conservatism was shown by different color. The
sequence of domain I, II and III were marked. The triangles indicate the amino acids
interact with GC376. b, The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure and the sites interact with
GC376 were shown, and the color represents the conservatism.
