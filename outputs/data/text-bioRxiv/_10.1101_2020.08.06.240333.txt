Abstract
Infection and replication of SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) requires entry
to the interior of host cells. In humans, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between the
SARS CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of
ACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entry
pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as
a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known
about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational
platforms, we predicted ‘hot-spot’ residues in a positive control PPI (PMI / MDM2) and the
CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was
performed to predict changes in Gibbs’ free energy that are associated with mutating
residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to
alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculate
macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI and
SARS CoV-2 / ACE2 PPI. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot-spot residues,
and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the
development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID-19.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19),
an established global health crisis.1,

2

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a

significant toll on the global economy and healthcare infrastructure, and is attributed to
more than 700,000 deaths worldwide; over 160,000 in the United States of America alone.
The number of infections, and resulting COVID-19-related deaths continues to grow at a
staggering rate. Older individuals, and those with pre-existing conditions, are at the
highest risk of death as a result of deleterious consequences related to SARS-CoV-2
infection. Moreover, negative outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection
disproportionately correlate with minorities, likely due to a number of factors.3 The
magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a global response from researchers
to identify therapeutics and/or prophylaxis capable of inhibiting, or slowing, infection and
propagation of this deadly disease.
SARS-CoV-2 must enter host cells to replicate. Previous studies on SARS-CoV,
which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, provided insight into the mechanism of cell entry.
As an early step in the cell entry mechanism, the viral spike protein (S) on the surface of
SARS-CoV binds the extracellular protease domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein on the surface of multiple cells, including cells in the lower
respiratory tract.4-7 This recognition event is followed by membrane fusion leading to host
cell entry. It was recently shown that SARS-CoV-2 also relies on an interaction between
its spike protein and ACE2 to gain entry to the interior of human cells. Cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis of the complex involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and human ACE2 was recently reported (PDB

code: 6M17), with an overall resolution of 2.9 Å and local resolution of 3.5 Å at the RBD /
ACE2 binding interface (Figure 1a).8
Given the important role the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between SARS-CoV2 RBD and ACE2 plays in host cell entry, inhibition of this PPI has received attention as
a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention.9, 10 Regions on ACE2 closest to
SARS-CoV-2 include the α1-helix (Figure 1b, blue) α2-helix (Figure 1b, orange) and the
β3-β4 loop (Figure 1b, green). Researchers have shown that a 23 residue peptide,
consisting of ACE2 α1-helix sequence (I21-S43) tightly binds SARS-CoV-2 (KD ~50
nM).10 However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings that stabilize
the SARS-CoV-2 / ACE2 complex. In an era when academic laboratories have been
closed, or severely limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to use multiple
computational platforms, with an emphasis on servers that are available online to all
researchers, to study the SARS-CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 complex examine the electrostatics
and topology of the interface, and identify “hot-spots” – amino acids, or clusters thereof,
that significantly contribute to the binding free energy of this therapeutically-relevant PPI.

Results
KFC-2 Hot-Spot Prediction
We used the Knowledge-based FADE and Contacts 2 (KFC-2), a free server that
compares favorably to Robetta, FOLDEF, HotPoint, and MINERVA, to predict hot-spot
residues and/or clusters at the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding interface.11, 12 As a positive
control in our study, we performed an analogous examination of the PMI / MDM2 complex
(PDB code: 3EQS, Figure 1a), which is well studied.13 PDB files for these two complexes

were loaded into the server, which revealed hot-spot residues at each interface. KFC
accurately predicted hot-spot residues on the PMI peptide, which have been
experimentally validated (Figure 2a).13 Specifically, residues F3, Y6, W7, and L10 were
identified as hot-spot residues on the PMI peptide. Complimentary hot-spot residues L54,
V75, V93, and I99 were identified as hot-spot residues on MDM2 (Figure 2a-b; hot-spot
scores are shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information). Identical analysis of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 complex illuminated five residues on both ACE2 and SARSCoV-2 RBD that were characterized as hot-spot residues (Figure 2c-d; values shown in
Figure S2, Supporting Information). Specifically, L455, Y489, Q498, T500 and Y505
were identified on SARS-CoV-2 RBD and T27, H34, D38, Y41, and K353 were identified
on ACE2. For both complexes, KFC-a values were used, as these have been shown to
have superior predictability outcomes compared to KFC-b values.12
Satisfyingly, four of the five predicted hot-spot residues on ACE2 (T27, H34, D38,
and Y41) are found on the α1-helix (Figure 1b, blue), and researchers have shown that
this helix alone (as a chemically synthesized 23 residue peptide) binds SARS-CoV-2 RBD
with a dissociation constant of ~50 nM.10 Lysine 353 was also identified as a hot-spot
residue, and is on the β3-β4 loop that neighbors the α1-helix (Figure 2d). When paired
with experimental results, demonstrating high affinity between ACE2 α1-helix and SARSCoV-2 RBD, these results suggest that KFC-2 correctly identified residues at the interface
critical to stability of the complex.

BAlaS Computational Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis

We next used BAlaS14, 15, a computational alanine scanning mutagenesis server,
to predict the change in free energy (ΔΔG) associated with mutating interface residues to
alanine. Our analysis focused on residues within 13 Å from the binding interface (set as
default) and residues plotted in Figure 3 are limited to those with predicted ΔΔG > 4
kJ/mol. BAlaS correctly identified hot-spot residues F3 (4.6 kcal/mol), Y6 (2.4 kcal/mol),
W7 (5.2 kcal/mol), and L10 (2.1 kcal/mol) on PMI. Residues L54 (4.6 kcal/mol), Y67 (2.4
kcal/mol), Q72 (1.7 kcal/mol), H96(1.1 kcal/mol) and V93 (1.5 kcal/mol) were also
identified as primary contributors to the binding free energy of the complex (Figure 3ab).
BAlaS analysis of the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex resulted in the prediction of
seven residues on ACE2 that contribute to the binding free energy of the complex (Figure
3c-d). The following residues, and associated changes in free energy, were identified:
D30 (0.3 kcal/mol), K31 (0.3 kcal/mol), H34 (0.5 kcal/mol), D38 (0.9 kcal/mol), Y41 (1.2
kcal/mol), Y83 (0.3 kcal/mol), and K353 (0.7 kcal/mol). ACE2 residues, and associated
predicted changes in binding free energy as a result of alanine mutagenesis are as
follows: K417 (1.9 kcal/mol), Y449 (1.0 kcal/mol), F456 (1.3 kcal/mol), F486 (2.1
kcal/mol), Y489 (1.8 kcal/mol), Q498 (1.2 kcal/mol), and Y505 (1.7 kcal/mol) (Figure 3cd). As was the case with the initial hot-spot prediction, the majority of the residues
predicted to stabilize the complex are on the α1-helix (D30, K31, H34, D38, Y41). As in
the KFC-2 hot-spot prediction, K353, which is found in the β3-β4 loop that flanks the α1helix, was predicted as a stabilizing residue in the complex. Tyrosine 83, in the α2-helix
(Figure 1b, Figure 3c-d), was also predicted as a contributor to complex stability.
Predicted changes in binding free energies for all computational mutations, for both PMI

/ MDM2 and SARS-CoV-2 / ACE2, are available in the Supporting Information (Figure
S2).

Electrostatics and Topology at the Binding Interface
We used the Adaptive Poisson-Botzmann Solver (APBS)16 to generate
electrostatic potential maps for the solvent-exposed surfaces of our positive control PPI
(PMI/MDM2) and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex. As seen in Figure 4a-b, the positive
control interaction is consistent with many PPIs, the driving factor for the PMI/MDM2
interaction is burying large, hydrophobic residues (most notably F3, W7, and L10) into a
well-defined, largely hydrophobic, binding pocket. This results in relatively large changes
in Gibbs’ free energy, as a result of beneficial changes in entropy (desolvation) and
enthalpy (e.g. van der Waals interactions, π-π stacking). The binding face of the SARSCoV-2 RBD / ACE2 complex (Figure 4a) was characterized as well. The binding surface
of ACE2 has a pronounced patch with increased hydrophobic character, relative to the
remainder of the surface, which aligns with the α1-helix (Figure 4d). Likewise, SARSCoV-2 RBD presents a relatively shallow binding pocket with hydrophobic character, into
which the α1-helix rests (Figure 4d). In contrast to the PMI / MDM2 complex, neither the
ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 surface contain deep, largely hydrophobic binding pockets.
Collectively, this supports our hot-spot and computational alanine scanning mutagenesis
studies. Compared to PMI / MDM2, more residues participate in stabilizing the complex;
however, the magnitude of predicted stabilization is lower for each residue in the SARSCoV-2 / ACE2 complex, compared to PMI / MDM2. We hypothesize that this is likely due

to decreased burying of hydrophobic residues in the former, and increased hydrogen
bonding and/or ion-paired interactions to stabilize the complex, relative to the later.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2, which causes Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), is wreaking havoc on
global economies and has been implicated in over 700,000 deaths worldwide. As an early
step in the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry to the interior of mammalian cells (a necessary
step in the virus lifecycle), SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds the extracellular protease domain
(PD) of ACE2, a protein on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract. Inhibition of
this Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic and/or
prophylactic target. Recent structural studies have revealed key features of the SARSCoV-2 RBD / ACE2 PD domain complex. Here, we conducted computational studies to
predict hot-spot residues at the interface of this therapeutically-relevant PPI.
KFC-2 hot-spot prediction revealed five residues each on ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 RBD that are predicted to stabilize the complex; computational alanine scanning with
BAlaS predicted seven residues on each protein, which when mutated, significantly alter
binding energy. There is good agreement between the two methods; both servers
predicted ACE2 residues H34, D38, Y41, and K353, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues
Y489, Q498, and Y505 as important for complex stability (Figure 5, residues highlighted
with an asterisk).
Interestingly, while the structure of SARS-CoV RBD aligns well with SARS-CoV-2
RBD, with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 0.68 Å over 139 pairs of Cα atoms8,
mutations exist, including interface residues predicted here to stabilize SARS-CoV-2 RBD

interactions with ACE2. For example, Y484®Q498, L443®F456, N479®Q493, and
L472®F486 mutations at equivalent positions of SARS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV-2
RBD, respectively, are observed.7, 8 These mutations may change the affinity between
SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2, relative to SARS-CoV, and likely alters the hot-spot geographies
on the binding surface of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, compared to SARS-CoV.
